 Raymong Kurzweil developed OCRtechnology in the 1970s, initially to create a reading machine for the blind.andO;His company was bought by Xerox in 1980 and later merged with Datacopy toform Xerox Imaging Systems.andP;  Palantir was formed in 1982, joining the battlefor supremacy.andP;  Both companies have offered systems based on increasinglypowerful and complex hardware.andM;Other vendors have flourished in niche markets, such as form processing orcheck reading.andP;  For general applications, though, these two have been on top.andO;Many users wanting the best have gladly paid them sums well into fivefigures.andM;No longer are the choices so simple.andP;  Explosive growth in the OCR market haschanged the competition at all levels.andP;  XIS and Calera now sell software-onlyversions of their systems, and vendors that began at the software end aremoving up-market.andM;The most ambitious challenger to this joint reign is Caere, whose OmniPagesoftware we reviewed earlier this year (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  5).andP;  Unlike XIS'sand Calera's pricier systems, Caere's new Parallel Reader does not use imagesgenerated by a scanning engine that was optimized for use with its OCRsoftware.andP;  However, the speed produced by four coprocessor boards and theaccuracy of the OmniPage recognition algorithms make the Parallel Reader asolid high-end contender.andM;The best of the bestandM;We tested the top systems from the three leading vendors of dedicated OCRsystems (ones that use specialized hardware beyond coprocessor boards).andP;  Inthe case of Xerox Imaging Systems, we also tested its second-best, because itwasn't clear that the top-of-the-line unit, the new K5200, would be availablefor testing before our deadline.andP;  The 5200 was ready in time for us to visitXIS's offices and test it; it is now being shipped in volume.andM;These systems' high-volume capabilities, non-mass-market distribution andfive-figure prices all made us consider presenting this review in the SeyboldReport on Publishing Systems, in which we cover professional electronicprepress systems.andP;  However, because we have customarily covered OCR here(e.g., Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  5), we decided to give this information to our DesktopPublishing readers.andM;Caere Parallel Reader.andP;  Pushing beyond its existing software- and board-basedsystems, Caere introduced the Parallel Reader this spring.andP;  This systemcomprises four OmniPage processor boards in a 386SX-based AT.andM;The machine comes configured with 1 MB of RAM, a 40-MB hard disk, two serialports and a parallel port, a VGA video card and two empty slots (for scannerand network cards).andP;  MS-DOS 4.1 and a runtime version of Windows arepreinstalled on the hard disk.andP;  It does not come with a monitor, a keyboardor a pointing device (such as a mouse); the user must supply all these.andP;  We'dlike to see Caere offer a turnkey option that includes those components.andM;Caere designed this system for ease of use as well as power.andP;  There arealways tradeoffs to be made; offering a smaller assortment of user-settableparameters than either of its main competitors has helped Caere to keepParallel Reader operation simple.andM;The Parallel Reader works with any of three scanners: the Fujitsu 3093, theHewlett-Packard ScanJet Plus or the Microtek MSII.andP;  An automatic documentfeeder (ADF) is required on all scanners.andP;  To work with the Fujitsu 3093, theParallel Reader needs a second megabyte of RAM and a Dunord Technologiesinterface.andM;The Parallel Reader is priced at $10,995.andP;  Outfitting it with a monitor,keyboard and pointing device adds about $800-1,000.andM;Calera CDP 9000.andP;  The Compound Document Processor 9000 is a sheetfed scanningsystem designed for OCR, with recognition processing hardware built in.andO;Although it scans at 400 dpi, it converts the images to 300 dpi for moreefficient processing and storage; this process sounds strange, but it doesn'tseem to harm character recognition.andM;Sheets are fed through the front of the machine; light is reflected from thepage to a lens mounted at the back.andP;  The short paper path makes scanningimpressively quick: the user generally configures the CDP to scan pages atrates of 3.3 or 5.4 seconds per page, depending on the type of original.andM;TopScan Professional is a software/board combination used to interface a PCto the CDP 9000.andP;  The software runs under Microsoft Windows (a version forWindows 3.0 is coming this fall).andP;  At least 1.3 MB of LIM-EMS RAM (memorythat conforms to the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory Specification) isrequired above the 640K of base memory.andP;  Also available is TopScan, a versionfor the Macintosh.andM;The CDP 9000 with TopScan Professional is priced at $31,950.andM;Xerox Imaging Systems' K5200.andP;  The new top-of-the-line system from XIS iscalled the K5200.andP;  Because of the aforementioned timing doubts, we alsotested the previous version, known as the K5100; however, both systems arenow available.andM;Because their software is so similar, we will henceforth write &quot;K5200&quot; whenwe discuss features common to both systems.andP;  We will only use &quot;K5100&quot; whendiscussing the performance of that model.andM;Both systems are based on a 400-dpi flatbed scanner with a &quot;bookedge&quot; designthat makes it easy to scan book or journal pages.andP;  The K5200's advantage isspeed.andP;  In the K5100, processing is performed on an AT-bus card that uses a68020 processor.andP;  The newer version, however, features RISC-based processingin a separate box with a SCSI interface.andM;The K5200's price is $19,950.andP;  The K5100's was recently reduced from $17,950to $14,950.andM;Comparative pricing.andP;  We have listed the system prices.andP;  However, theParallel Reader also needs a scanner, and the Calera and XIS systems needhost computers.andM;If no computer is already available for this work, one must be purchased.andP;  Areasonably well-configured host computer can be bought for $1,500 (basic '286machine) to $3,000 (fast '386).andM;It is less likely that a customer will have an existing scanner that can beused with the Parallel Reader.andP;  The Fujitsu 3093, with the necessaryinterface and ADF, costs $6,145; it also requires an extra MB of RAM for thecomputer.andP;  The HP ScanJet Plus with a necessary interface and optional ADFlists for $2,785.andP;  The Microtek MSII, which has a built-in document feeder,lists for $1,495.andM;Adding the HP or Microtek scanner would bring the full Parallel Reader systemprice into the same ballpark as that of the K5100; adding the Fujitsu insteadwould move it closer to the K5200's price.andM;In extremely high-volume applications, hardware life may become a factor.andP;  Wedoubt that any of these scanners except possibly the Fujitsu is built tostand as heavy and constant a load as are the Calera and XIS scanning units.andM;Putting them to workandM;These systems are powerful--and complex.andP;  Among them, the three systems wetested came with more than 700 pages of documentation.andM;Because we live in an imperfect world where time and space are finite, we didnot test every capability.andP;  We did not try to read charts or tables.andP;  We madeonly basic use of their graphics functions.andP;  We did not ask them to readpages in landscape mode, or pages on colored stock, or pages with rotatedtext, or pages with bizarre layouts.andM;Mainly, we just shoveled portrait-mode pages of straight-forward text throughthem until they begged for mercy.andM;That's just a figure of speech, of course.andP;  These systems are based onheavy-duty hardware designed to handle many thousands of pages a month(although we couldn't get duty cycles from the manufactures whose scannerssupport the Parallel Reader).andP;  We didn't push them anywhere near theirphysical limits in our testing, and most users are also unlikely to do so.andM;For the sake of completeness, we should mention our full hardwareconfigurations.andP;  The K5200, which we tested at XIS's headquarters, was hookedup to a 20-MHZ '386 PC with 4 MB of RAM.andP;  We installed the K5100 on a 12-MHz'286 machine with 1 MB of RAM.andP;  TopScan Professional wound up on a 16-MHz'386 with 6 MB of RAM.andM;These platforms have little effect on system performance; nearly allprocessing takes place on boards inside the scanners and/or on the systeminterface boards installed in the host computer.andP;  The main areas in which thehost computer affects speed are writing of files to disk during processingand conversion of completed files to other formats.andM;We used the Parallel Reader with a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet Plus equipped withan ADF.andP;  We don't know how its scanning speed compares to that of the Fujitsuor Microtek units.andM;Installation and testing.andP;  Our testing followed a predictable course.andP;  First,we installed the systems.andP;  That in itself is noteworthy because XIS andCalera vendors almost invariably do the installing.andP;  Because we areexperienced, knowledgeable and generally prideful, we said, &quot;Just ship 'emand we'll install 'em.&quot;andP;  Two botched installations later, we decided to actlike &quot;normal&quot; customers next time.andM;We even had some trouble with the Parallel Reader, which the user generallyinstalls.andP;  However, one call to customer support cleared it up.andM;Having been talked through proper installation procedures by vendorrepresentatives, we started to use the systems, letting intuition be ourguide.andP;  After much head-scratching, we sat down and read the manuals fromcover to cover, keeping copious notes.andP;  Then we started working our waythrough the systems again, having a much easier time of it.andM;Finally, we rounded up a group of eight documents with whih to test them.andP;  Weprocessed each of these documents many times, trying different softwareoptions.andP;  The results of these tests are detailed below.andM;The recognition processandM;Each of these systems offers a different recognition process and a unique setof user-definable parameters.andP;  Here are simplified views of the sequences ofevents.andM;Parallel Reader.andP;  After choosing &quot;Scan,&quot; the user is presented with the scansettings menu.andP;  The submenus include page options (landscape, legal,double-sided, dot-matrix, invert data [light text on a dark background]);recognition options (number of columns, user-defined zones, retain pageformat, &quot;no parsing&quot; [the entire document is recognized as a single textblock]); and image options (record image only, change contrast, and line artor either of two halftone modes).andM;Next comes the file save menu.andP;  To save text or an image automatically, theuser picks a name and a format for the text or image file.andP;  The user canchoose to have each page saved as a separate file or to have a specifiedmarker placed between pages.andM;Now the scan begins.andP;  If &quot;multiple zones&quot; has been selected, a reduced viewof the page appears, upon which the user can specify zones.andP;  Once recognitionbegins, a graphic view shows each board's status (scanning, parsing,recognizing or idle) and how far along it is.andM;When recognition finishes, the Parallel Reader jumps directly into thetransitional editor.andP;  Here, the user can make corrections, automatically jumpto the next recognized error, or simply save the file in any availableformat.andM;TopScan Professional.andP;  Parameters can be selected from the main screen orfrom the &quot;change settings&quot; menu.andP;  The user defines page orientation; scanarea (text and/or image; automatic, &quot;interactive choice&quot; [user-defined zones]or predefined template[s'); workflow (scan and read, prescan images, importimages, or read prescanned images); text type (normal or monospaced);flagging of uncertain words (none, program marker, marker plus image of word,or user-defined character); contrast; and filtering (specifies the pointsizes it should try to recognize).andP;  Then the user clicks on a button, andscanning begins.andM;If &quot;interactive choice&quot; was selected, an image (viewable at any of threesizes) appears so that the user can define zones.andP;  After recognition begins,a grphic display hows the portion of the current page that has beenprocessed.andM;When recognition is finished, a list of the page numbers appears.andP;  The usercan enter the correction editor, &quot;export&quot; (sae) the file or proceed to thenext document.andM;K5200.andP;  The XIS sytem offers by far the widest array of user-specifiableparameters.andP;  Tweaking all of its knobs is time-consuming (and the process issometimes inefficient), but no more than a few settings should be changed formost documents.andM;Five document quality settings are available: standard, draft dot-matrix,tinted background, fine [thin] text and newsprint.andP;  Other selections arebrightness; verification (on or off and/or use an existing file); text type(letters, numbers or both); create or load a user lexicon; primary languageused in the document; lexical context (on, which checks words againstlexicons and against common word characteristics; off, which checks ohlyagainst characteristics; off, which neither); confidence level, a numberbetween 1 and 50 that specifies how confident the system should be before itviews a character as correctly identified; document feeder enabled or not;page orientation; number of columns (1-4, or auto-detect); cropping window onor off (to define a portion of the page to be recognized); page number of thenext page; page number increment; page location (the scanner automaticallydetermines the page's size and position); and page height and width, inmillimeters or hundredths of an inch.andM;After making any necessary changes to the default settings, the user enters aname for the output file.andP;  Scanning then begins.andM;If verification was chosen, the sytem beeps when it hits the first uncertaincharacter.andP;  Pressing a key takes the user into verification mode, where thesytem shows the image of a word (and possibly neighboring ones) along withits best guess of what the word is.andP;  The user can accept this gues or changeany characters in the word.andM;When recognition is finished, the system returns to the main menu.andP;  If theverification mode was used, the file it produced can be saved.andP;  The user canthen save the recognized file in any available format or move to the nextdocument.andM;Types of originals.andP;  The K5200's flatbed design features a bookedge thatpermits easy scanning of book or magazine pages.andP;  Even a thick book can bescanned without damage to the binding.andM;Conversely, the CDP is sheetfed; it can only use single sheets.andP;  Therefore, abook or magazine page must be photo-copied, which can degrade an image(although first-generation copies should show little quality loss); it canalso skew an image, making it harder for an OCR system to read.andM;Although the scanners that work with the Parallel Reader are flatbeds,Caere's current software requires an ADF to be used, so anything that can'tfit through the feeder must be photocopied.andM;Both Calera's and XIS's systems can read multiple documents in succession andautomatically save them as different files if a blank sheet is placed aftereach.andM;Zoning.andP;  This hardware difference appears to give XIS the advantage inlow-volume applications.andP;  However, the K5200 is weak in working withunusually formatted documents or partial pages--typical of low-volumeapplications--because of its poor zoning capabilities.andM;A K5200 user can define a &quot;cropping window&quot;; anything outside that area willbe excluded from the scan.andP;  It is difficult to define that window, though.andO;There is no visual method.andP;  Instead, the user must specify the distance ofthis window's four sides from the top left corner of the page.andM;Futhermore, only one such window can be created.andP;  Many documents have layoutstoo complex for this feature.andM;TopScan Professional's analogous &quot;interactive choice&quot; (one-time zoning) and&quot;template&quot; (reurable zoning) functions display a page in any of three sizes.andO;With a mouse, the user draws any number of zones, framing the easily visiblepage components.andP;  These zones can be moved, resized or reordered.andM;Calera has built into TopScan Professional an innovative feature called &quot;IDzone.&quot;andP;  When a page is scanned, the software examines that defined area ofthe page.andP;  It can then choose an appropriate template for that document,based on the text in the zone.andP;  This capability should be a boon for manytypes of forms work.andM;TopScan Professional can also use multiple templates in one jobautomatically.andP;  If photocopied book pages are being scanned, for instance,the software can be configured to alternate between templates for recto andverso pages.andM;The Parallel Reader's &quot;multiple zones&quot; feature lags Calera's but beats theK5200's.andP;  The user defines zones with a mouse; they can be moved or resized,but not reordered.andP;  An expanded view mode enables fine adjustments of zones.andM;In sum, XIS's hardware is the best suited for most nonstandard documents, asis Calera's software.andP;  This balance could change quickly.andP;  We doubt thatCalera will release a flatbed CDP anytime soon.andP;  However, Caere's nextsoftware release (for which no schedule is available) will enable theParallel Reader to work on flatbed scanners without ADFs.andP;  Meanwhile, XIS isdeveloping for the K5200 a graphical user interface with improved zoningfeatures, which we will described in the next issue of this Report.andM;O  Other languages.andP;  Fortunately, none of these U.S.-based vendors is purelyethnocentic.andP;  Each of the systems supports about ten foreign character sets.andO;XIS also sells French, German, Italian and spanish versions of its systems,which include not only character sets, lexicons and contextual rules, butalso menus in those languages.andP;  Calera offers French and German lexicons andcontextual rules.andM;AccuracyandM;Accuracy is the most important measure of on OCR system.andP;  If a system isslow, can't work with graphics, has a balky user interface, and can't savefiles as anything but ASCII, it's still worth somthing if it can recognizecharacters well.andP;  A system that can rotate images by thousandths of a degree,is driven by the user's brain waves and can save files in 79 ways includingthe rate Tibetan Triple Clef sheet-music format is worthless if it can't tella 5 from an S.andM;Different documents, different results.andP;  Each of these systems had areas ofrelative strength and weakness.andP;  To pinpoint them we assembled eightdocuments, ranging from one to 11 pages.andP;  Half of them were at least fourpages long; they highlighted the systems' volume-processing capabilities.andP;  Weused the shorter ones to assess basic accuracy.andM;Although the K5200 was much faster than the K5100, their accuracies wereroughly equivalent.andP;  What we say about the K5200's accuracy can also be usedas a guideline for the K5100's.andM;Here are descriptions of our test documents, from the easiest up to thetoughest, and of each system's accuracy in reading them.andM;A seven-page monospaced press release (on bond paper) with many paragraphstyles.andP;  This clearly printed sample was no challenge; all systems performedflawlessly except that they misread some characters with descenders inunderlined subheads.andM;One page of Courier Italic, typed, them photocopied.andP;  TopScan Professionalmade one noise-induced error and falsely declared the whole page to be bolditalic, but it got everything else right.andP;  The K5200 and the Parallel Readereach got one word wrong.andM;Four pages of typed serif output, two from each of two typewriters.andP;  Again,all systems excelled.andP;  The K5200 read an M as an N, and it substitutedcharacters for noise in two instances.andP;  It correctly noted a change in linespacing.andP;  TopScan Professional turned two line-ending double hyphens intosingle hyphens and one double space to a single space.andP;  The Parallel Readerproduced five faulty words.andP;  Neither of the latter systems noted the new linespacing.andM;Two-thirds of a page from a nine-pin dot-matrix printer in &quot;near letterquality&quot; mode.andP;  TopScan Professional mixed up quotation marks andapostrophes, and the K5200 missed an apostrophe; both had trouble on anunderlined word (the K5200 did better there), but were perfect otherwise.andO;The Parallel Reader turned out mistake-filled files in both normal and[draft] dot-matrix modes.andM;An eleven-page chapter photocopied from John W. Seybold's book The Word ofDigital Typesetting.andP;  We feared the worst but were pleasantly surprised.andP;  Wechecked accuracy on the first page and the fifth page.andP;  TopScan Professionalmade two word errors, turned noise into a period, and misread a lot of italictext.andP;  The K5200 made four word errors in the Roman text, and the ParallelReader made about 25, but both clearly outperformed the Calera system on theitalicized words.andM;A page from Time magazine, containing a headline, a subhead, three columns oftext and a photo.andP;  TopScan Professional missed one hyphen and misidentifiedone word as bold italic; otherwise, it read everything correctly, includingthe subhead.andP;  The Parallel Reader misread six words, the K5200 seven; eachmade one mistake in the subhead.andM;Two 1/3-1/2-page articles from the Philadelphia Inquirer, each taped to aplain white sheet.andP;  TopScan Professional got 12 words wrong in the first, 18in the second.andP;  The K5200 missed 12 in the first, 21 in the second.andP;  Inaddition, both produced garble on one line of text that was not printed asclearly.andP;  The Parallel Reader missed only 4 words in the first article, butdid badly in the second, probably due to skewing.andP;  However, the ParallelReader reproduced the less clear line flawlessly.andM;Six pages photocopied from the Latest Word section of a Seybold Report.andP;  Thiswas a tough test because our text is tightly set and because photocopyingcauses both image degradation and skew.andP;  The K5200 erred on 15-40 words perpage out of about 1,000, a figure that could have been reduced substantiallythrough &quot;verification&quot; (see below).andP;  TopScan Professional made two to threetimes as many mistakes, but ia also flagged practically all of them (and veryfew correct words).andP;  The Parallel Reader was inconsistent; skew might havebeen a factor again.andP;  It did worse than TopScan Professional on some pages,but recorded fewer than 10 errors on others and fared best with our boldleadins.andM;Overall, then, the three systems matched up pretty evenly on accuracy.andP;  Theywere about equal at noting text styles and layout.andM;Related notes.andP;  In our tests, we did not use the K5200's &quot;verification&quot;function (see Fixing Errors, below).andP;  This training capability helps preventthe system from repeating specific errors.andP;  For instance, about half of theK5200's errors on our Seybold Report test were faulty recognitions of theletters f, r and t.andP;  By spending a minute or two interactively training it torecognize these and other characters, we could have eliminated most of theseerrors.andM;Conversion routines caused problems for two systems.andP;  XIS's XyWriteconversion utility dropped many line-ending wordspaces, but its otherconversions produced the proper spaces.andP;  (XIS has contracted for a betterXyWrite conversion.)andP;  Hoping to see a formatted, PC-generated file on aMacintosh, we saved a Parallel Reader file in Microsoft Word 4.0 format, thentried to read it with MacWrite IIf that program twice produced an emptydocument, then hung.andP;  Other Parallel Reader conversions worked fine.andM;Because each system was more adept than the others in certain areas, apotential customer must test them on documents typical of those that he orshe will scan.andP;  It doesn't matter how a system performs on documents that itsvendor supplies.andP;  If you visit a dealer or a trade show, bring documents!andM;Word lists.andP;  Another tool that these systems use to increase their accuracyis word lists.andP;  Calera and Caere call them dictionaries; XIS refers to themas lexicons.andP;  The systems can check uncertain words against these lists;finding one there can raise its certainty level to the point where that wordis no longer flagged as uncertain.andP;  The user can disable this confirmationprocess.andM;Each system comes with a built-in list: the K5200's contains about 50,000,TopScan Professional's about 68,000.andP;  Caere says that its spelling checkerwill contain a generic list plus specific ones for medcal and legal terms,with the three lists totaling about 100,000 words.andM;Users can also build lists.andP;  Each user list in the K5200 can contain up to10,000 words, but only one list can be used at a time in conjunction with thesystem lexicon.andP;  TopScan Professional lets the user employ multiple liststogether with the built-in one, but the active user dictionaries cannot totalmore than 1,000 words.andM;The Parallel Reader offers the most freedom: the number and size of userdictionaries that can be used at once is limited only by disk space.andP;  (Addingmore words and/or lists increases program loading time and/or processing timefor all systems, though.)andP;  A K5200 user can easily merge user lexicons, soXIS's limit of user lexicon at a time is less restricting than Calera's1,000-word limit.andP;  That number of words won't suffice in applicationsinvolving many technical terms.andP;  For instance, our Vendor Directory contaiscontact information for more 800 vendors whose names have appeared in ourReports.andP;  Some are different divisions of the same company, but there areprobably 500 separate firms.andP;  IF each of these vendors sells just threeproducts, that's already 2,000 nonstandard terms we're likely to use, andthat doesn't even count industry jargon.andM;Is any of them good enough?andP;  In addition to comparing these systems to eachother, we should mention the kinds of work that are still beyond any currentOCR system's abilities.andP;  Such jobs become ever rarer, but they still exist.andM;Tightly set text, non-Roman text, unusual typefaces, skewed documents, andpoor-quality (low-resolution or low-contrast) documents present the biggestproblems.andM;The Parallel Reader was the only system to get fewer than 15 words wrong onany page of the photocopied Seybold Report sample, which was tightly set.andP;  Onsome (possibly skewed) pages from the sample, though, it made many mistakes.andM;All of the systems botched much of the italic text in the World of DigitalTypesetting sample.andP;  All of them misrecognized underlned characters withdescenders in a couple of tests.andP;  We writer (and then photocopied) througheach system.andP;  All of them produced unusable grable.andM;Our main in-house use for OCR is reading documents received on our faxmachine.andP;  Low resolution and frequent &quot;noise&quot; can make them tough torecognize.andP;  Often, whatever system we use makes so many errors that it mighthave been faster for our production staff to retype the whole document.andO;(However, we plan to take one vendor's advice and ask people who send usfaxes that must be scanned to change their fax machines' resolution settingsfrom &quot;standard&quot; to &quot;fine&quot;.)andM;The decison of whether or not to use OCR also depends on how the resultingfiles will be used.andP;  Someone building an electronic collection of articlesfor personal reference can stand a few errors.andP;  Someone scanning a bookrepublish it without further editing or proofreading has no error tolerance.andM;For some types of documents, offshore redundant key-boarding is still aviable and possibly superior alternative to scanning and correcting.andP;  Currentrates are in the range of $1-2 per 1,000 characters, and if the procedure isdone correctly (shady operators are not unknown), errors are virtuallynonexistant.andP;  Any user whose application is extremely error-intolerant mustconsider this alternative.andM;These systems can handle an astonishing array of documents.andP;  They have notyet become omnipotent.andM;Fixing errorsandM;Because any OCR system is bound to be uncertain about some characters, it isvital that the user know where these characters are.andP;  When we made the propermenu choices, all three systems, flagged the great majority of the errorsthey made.andM;XIS's verification.andP;  All three products can recognize a wide variety oftypestyles accurately with no user prodding.andP;  However, the K5200 offers thebenefit of a &quot;verification&quot; process that lets the user improve its accuracy.andO;We achieved clear gains (at the cost of user time) by building such averification file, then using it to help similar documents.andM;When the K5200 is run in verification mode, it pops up images of words thatcould not be recognized with more than a specific (settable) level ofcertainty.andP;  The system's best guess at the word is also shown.andP;  Based on theimage, which usually shows a couple of adjoining words too, the user canconfirm the system's guess, enter other characters or request a larger partof the image in order to see more context.andP;  The system adds each confirmedcharacter to the verification file, then moves on to the next uncertain word.andM;There is a tradeoff involvred here: the longer the user spends onverification, the fewer errors will be made.andP;  While verification isinefficient for very short or easy-to-read documents, it is a greta advantageon longer and tougher tasks.andP;  It is especially valuable if the user must scanmany documents created by the same output device.andM;Calera's Correction Editor.andP;  By using the verification option, a K5200 useralso fixes recognition errors on the curren document.andP;  In that respect,though, Calera has the upper hands.andP;  Its Correction Editor shows the usercharacters and words of which it is uncertain, but unlike XIS's verification,this process can be run at any time.andP;  To fix flagged words, a K5200 user mustbe at the keyboard during recognition; a TopScan Professional user can fixthem as soon as recognition is done or fix many files together, perhaps atthe end of each working day.andM;TopScan Preofessional officers four flagging options: off; application flags,which puts a user-defined character in front of each uncertain word; editorflags, which highlights those words in the correction editor; and editorpopups, which highlights them and also (when a word is reached in theCorrection Editor) pops up an image of the uncertain character(s) and a fewneighboring ones.andP;  In the latter two modes, a key combination moves thecursor to the next uncertain word in the Correction Editor.andM;The images offered in editor popups mode are helpful, but they come at acost.andP;  Because these images must be saved to disk during recognition, itgenerally took us 25-35% longer to recognize a document in editor popups modethan in editor flags mode.andP;  The images could also occupy significant diskspace in a document containing many uncertain words.andM;Caere's Transitional Editor.andP;  As soon as recognition is finished, thedocument appears in the Parallel Reader's Transitional Editor.andP;  The user canjump automatically to the next character of which the system is uncertain.andO;Unidentifiable characters are shown as tildes, but there is no highlightingof problem words, which is very effective in TopScan Professional.andM;The biggest drawback to the Transitional Editor is that the user cannot seethe original image.andP;  Enough context os shown that most words can be figuredout, but in many instances (such as model or part numbers), the user mustlook the word jup in the original document--a potentially time-consumingtask.andM;Comparative benefits.andP;  The benefit of a post-recognition editor such asCalera's or Caere's i sthat editing can be performed at any time.andP;  A K5200user must be physically at the computer during recognition.andP;  The severity ofthis restriction depends on each user's application.andM;Still, the K5200's verification feature is a large advantage.andP;  Despite XIS'slamentable lack of a post-recognition editor, it offers the best way to fixerrors: namely, by preventing them from being made.andM;SpeedandM;Customers evaluating high-end OCR systems usuallu focus on two areas:accuracy and speed.andP;  Those are the benefits of a systems based on aspecialized scanner.andM;Calera and XIS have taken turns offering the fastest system.andP;  Whichever onehas come out with the more recent top-of-th-line product is likely to be thetemporary speed leader.andP;  The CDP's surprisingly short paper path gives it astandard scanning speed of just 3.3 seconds a page; XIS, whose scanning takesseveral times as long, must compensate on the processing end.andM;Now Caere has joined the battle.andP;  Running with a ScanJet Plus, it scannedmore slowly that the K5200, but four Omni-Page boards working separately atonce create formidable processing power.andM;In our testing, each timing began when we pressed ENTER to start therecognition process and ended when processing had finished and the systemtold us that no more pages were available.andP;  We did not count time used todefine page zones.andP;  Nor did we count translation to a file format; the K5200was clearly fastest, though that process seldon took more than 10 seconds andnever more than 30.andM;The K5200 system was the fastest overall, averaging roughly 25 seconds to oneminute per page, depending on the job's length and complexity.andP;  It left itsolder &quot;brother&quot; in the dust: the K5200 system took from 1 1/I to 3 times aslong to complete each recognition task.andP;  The CDP 9000 with TopScanProfessional beat the K5100 on speed, and its fast scanning helped itoutperform the K5200 in the simplest documents, but it settles for secondoverall.andM;The Parallel REader's performance varied the most; its multiple-board designdidn't help it on single-page jobs, but when its four processors were allrecognizing different pages at once, it was a speed demon.andP;  The ParallelReader was faster than the K5100 in all but the Courier Italic test (where itwas two seconds slower), and it beat both the K5200 and TopScan Professionalon the tough Seybold Report test.andP;  It also (surprisingly) nosed out theCalera system on the single-page Time test.andM;The total times for our eight documents, rounded to the nearest half minute,were 19 1/2 minutes for the K5200, 20 minutes for TopScan Prodfessional, 23minutes for the Parallel Reader and 49 minutes for the K5100.andP;  Adding thetime needed to convert each file to a word processor format would boost theK5200's lead over the Calera system to several minutes.andM;Three tests should give a good idea of typical processing time.andP;  On the11-page World of Digital Typesetting test, the respective results (given inminutes and seconds, with systems in the order listed in the previousparagraph) were 4:20, 4:41, 5:12 and 9:22.andP;  On the shorter but far morecomplex Seybold Report test, they were 7:20, 8:52, 6:09 and 23:50.andP;  On thesimpler four-typed-page test, they were 1:44, 1:06, 1:59 and 2:20.andM;Overall, then, the K5200 appears slightly faster than the CDP 9000 when filetranslation is included.andP;  The Parallel Reader will likely lag both of thosesystems on short and simple documents, but on documents that create work forall four boards, it could still be the fastest OCR gun in town.andM;Lower-cost options.andP;  With a CDP 9000, TopScan Professional costs $31,950,which is $12,000 more than a K5200 and $17,000 more than a K5100 (the priceof which was recently reduced from $17,950 to $14,950).andP;  However, TopScanProfessional can alsi be bought with a CDP 6000 for $19,950.andP;  That oldermodel is rated at slightly more than half the speed if the CDP 9000: &quot;up to140 characters per second,&quot; compared to 250.andP;  If it meets that claim, it is abit faster (as well as a bit more expensive) than a K5100.andM;XIS is offering the older K5000 model fr $10,950.andP;  It is similar to theK5100; its main drawback is the lack of a verification function, which isn'tcrucial for reading clear, simple originals.andM;XIS also sells the Discover series, a range of dedicated OCR systems.andP;  TheDiscover Model 30 ($6,995) includes a 300-dpi flatbed scanner; both the Model20 ($4,995) and Model 10 ($3,995, portrait scanning only) use a sheetfedunit.andP;  All work with MS-DOS PCs.andM;Nondedicated systems.andP;  Each of the three vendors also offers a line oflower-priced OCR products.andM;XIS's Discover Freedom costs $3,995 with a PC coprocessor card or $2,995 forsoftware only.andP;  XIS's Datacopy division markets AccuText software ($799) forthe Macintosh (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  5).andM;Calera sells a PC-compatible, coprocessor-board-based TopScan Professionalsystem, usable with flatbed scanners, for $6,495.andP;  TrueScan, anotherboard-based system that lacks TopScan's Windows interface and some of itsintelligence, sells for $3,995 (a slower version is available for $1,995).andO;Calera recently released WordScan ($595) and WordScan Plus ($995) software aswell as board-based WordScan systems ($3,995) for ATs or Micro ChannelArchitecture machines.andM;Caere just dropped the price of its board-based OmniPage '286 product from$1,995 ro $1,295.andP;  Its OmniPage software sells for $795 for the Macintoshversion, $895 for the '386 PC version.andM;Last month, Caere announced the Typist, a combination of a specially designed5&quot; hand scanner and a version of OmniPage for PC or Mac.andP;  Althoughinappropriate for volume work, this product has good potential as a toll forreading short documents or segments of them.andP;  See page 19 for moreinformation on the Typist.andM;Most of these products contain the same basic algorithms used in thehigher-end systems.andP;  Moving from a software-only system to a board-based oneincrease speed; jumping from there to a K5100/5200 or a CDP 6000/9000 gainsspeed and ensures image quality (and hence more reliable accuracy).andO;Graduating from OmniPage '286 to the Parallel Reader doesn't change imagequality, but it pumps up recognition speed of multipage documents.andM;File conversionandM;Once a file has been scanned and recognized, it is usually converted to aformat suitable for import into the user's text processing program.andO;Different routines produce codes indicating both text styles (bold, italic,etc.) and page formatting (justification, end of a page, etc.).andM;All three systems can output formatted files for use by common PC wordprocessors such as WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, WordStar, XyWrite, Multimate,Volkswriter, Samna and PFS's line (First Choice, Write and ProfessionalWrite).andP;  All support the Navy DIF format; the military's prodigious output ofdocuments makes it a natural customer.andP;  All can output files in ASCII andMicrosoft RTF (Rich Text Format).andP;  Each of them also supports some formatsthat once or both competitors don't, such as Wang PC, IBM Writing Assistant,DEC WPS Plus, the .WK1 spreadsheet format, EBCDIC (an IBM mainframe format),Borland Sprint and Nota Bene.andM;In addition, each of these systems can save files in a proprietaryintermediate format from which conversions can be produced later.andM;Interleaft and FrameMaker.andP;  XIS is the clear leader in converting recognizedtext to different formats.andP;  Its competitors satisfy the needs of most&quot;desktop publishers,&quot; but users of higher-end systems will appreciate XIS'swider array of options.andM;For an extra $495 each, a user can buy routines that convert scanneddocuments into Interleaft Publisher or FrameMaker formats.andP;  Theselong-document processors, which run on Macintosh or Unix systems (Interleafalso has an MS-DOS version), feature style sheets based on paragraph tagging.andO;The K5100 successfully produced Interleaf and FrameMaker files in which eachkind of paragraph (headline, subhead, body text, etc.) had its own tag; thesetags were consistent among paragraphs of the same kind.andP;  The tags sometimesdiffered from page to page, but Interleaf and FrameMaker users would stillbenefit greatly.andM;This recognition and translation routine makes it easy to open a scanned filein once of those programs and apply style sheets or make global changes toparagraph styles and other parameters.andP;  (The K5200 also produces filesformatted for RTF WordPerfect stylesheets.)andP;  Interleaf and Framemaker canalso read files produced by TopScan Professional and the Parallel Reader, butthe paragraphs will not be properly identified.andP;  (See next month's issue foran in-depth look at Interleaf Publisher and FrameMaker as well as VenturaPublisher.)andM;CALS.andP;  Another XIS benefit is an option ($5,000 with a K5100 or K5200, $6,000separately) for producing CALS SGML text files.andP;  CALS, the U.S.andP;  Departmentof Denfese's Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support initiative, wasdevised to specify standard formats in which manuals, engineering drawingsand other information could be provided to the DoD.andP;  The K5200's CALscapability, which is based on software licensed from Avalanche Development,converts certain military documents to an ASCII file with SGML markup basedon the CALS tagset.andP;  (For an overview of CALS and its effects on thepublishing industry, see the Seybold Report on Publishing Systems, Vol.andP;  18,No.andP;  2.)andM;Avalanche's FastTag software ($2,450) can translate documents from Calera'sPDA format into a CALS-compliant format; a version of FastTag coming out thismonth will also work with files from XIS's KDOC format.andP;  The KDOC formatcontains more information about the position of elements on the page thandoes the PDA format.andM;XIS's CALS option also works with KDOC files, but can save them only asCALS-compliant SGML files, not in any other format that FastTag offers.andM;Custom conversion.andP;  XIS's final trump is a built-in feature that lets a userbuild a conversion routine.andP;  The user can specify about 30 options, such aswhether to preserve line spacing between lines, only between paragraphs ornot at all; whether to replace tabs with ASCII codes, hex codes or spaces;how to identify a change in font size or style; and how to identify thebeginning of a column.andM;With this feature, the user can produce files usable by programs for which noconversion routine exists.andM;Saving and recognizing images.andP;  Pages or parts of pages can be saved ingraphics formats for use in other programs.andP;  The Parallel Reader can saveimages only in compressed or uncompressed TIFF formats; TopScan Professionaladds other flavors of TIFF as well as PCX; and the K5200 can save as TIFF,PCX, Interleaf IMG or Xerox RES.andM;Images can also be saved at one time and recognized later.andP;  The K5200 and theParallel Reader can recognize TIFF images created by other programs, makingmore efficient use of their expensive hardware.andP;  The CDPs can recognize bothTIFF and PCX images.andM;SummaryandM;All of these systems impressed us.andP;  However, each had strong and weak points.andO;Use these notes (and this entire article) as a guide for further exploration.andM;Calera.andP;  The usuanl sheetfed design of Calera's CDPs produces fast scanningtimes.andP;  However, this design strategy carries drawbacks.andP;  For one, onlysingle detached sheets can be scanned.andP;  If you need to scan pages from booksor magazines, you must photocopy them, which degrades image quality slightly(but not drastically, judging from our tests).andP;  The same is true if you havea skewed original: on a flatbed scanner you could merely turn it,but you mustphotocopy it for use on a CDP.andM;Calera says that the CDP is not meant to be used for such applications.andP;  Itmakes little sence, one representative told us, to have someone standing infront of an expensive system and scanning a book one page at a time.andP;  We seea tradeoff: speed vs.andP;  convenience.andP;  How often will a typical buyer of such asystem need to scan material from nondetached pages?andP;  If it is seldom, thenthe CDP presents little barrier; if often, then the buyer must consider timeand image degradation caused by photocopying.andM;TopScan Professional is extremely user-friendly.andP;  Anyone who can use a mousewill have no trouble.andP;  The system's feature set, though not the equal of theK5200's, will suffice for nearly any common application.andM;The CDP 9000/TopScan Professional combination is impressive.andP;  It offersspeed, ease of use and strong accuracy.andP;  Its price of about $30,000, farhigher than those of its competitors, is the largest drawback.andP;  Try sampledocuments on this system, or on the more affordable CDP 600, before spendingfive figures with anyone else.andM;K5200.andP;  If you prefer graphical user interfaces,t he K5200's interface mayseem clunky.andP;  An overwhelming array of functions is available, but manycannot be performed efficiently.andP;  Zoning, with its one-zone limit and itsenter-the-numbers operation, is a glaring weakness.andP;  But there are also moresubtle inconveniences, such as having to enter a new &quot;next page number&quot; and&quot;page number increment&quot; when flipping a stack of double-sided pages.andP;  (BothThe Parallel Reader and TopScan Professional require only a single mouseclick to specify a double-sided stack.)andM;These situations may change with the advent of XIS's graphical interface forthe K5200, the scheduling of which is unannounced.andP;  We will have details onit in our next issue.andM;The K5200's unique features stand out.andP;  They include its ability to &quot;learn&quot;in verification mode, its user-settable certainty threshold, the widestselection of file conversions (including Interleaft Publisher, FrameMaker,CALS and custom), and (last but not least) an outstanding scanner that readsat 400 dpi and works well with bound originals.andP;  Context-sensitive help is awelcome nicety.andM;Depending on the type of document being read, the new K5200 is the fastest ofthese systems or darn close.andP;  Its unaided accuracy is second to none, and theverification feature can make it even more accurate.andM;Priced at about $20,000 (well below the CDP 9000), and offering a largerfeature set than the Parallel Reader, the K5200 is an outstanding option foranyone planning to do high-volume OCR.andP;  More budget-constrained customerswill find the K5100 and K5000 attractive.andM;Caere.andP;  At first, we weren't sure whether to include the Parallel Reader inthis article.andP;  We figured that the more expensive systems with proprietaryscanners would be too much better.andP;  We were wrong.andM;Caere's OmniPage software is known for its accuracy and its &quot;pagedecomposition&quot; abilities.andP;  Our doubts focused more on relative image quality.andO;In our tests, though, the HP ScanJet Plus fed the Parallel Reader sharpenough images that it roughly matched the &quot;big boys&quot; in accuracy.andP;  It shouldbenefit further when Caere's spelling checker becomes available this month.andM;On tasks such as clear typewritten pages, the Parallel Reader can't apply allits boards at once, so its processing time lags.andP;  But it showed that on long,complex jobs, it could beat our other test systems.andM;Caere could improve this system immensely by displaying the original imagesof uncertain words in the Transitional Editor.andP;  That weakness and theinsufficiently detailed manuals stand out in an otherwise competent thoughnot feature-packed system.andM;The Parallel Reader seemed at first like a simple-minded idea: throw a bunchof hardware at the problem.andP;  But simple ideas can be powerful, and theParallel Reader's one-two punch of higher power and relatively low price(about $11,000 by itself, $14-19,000 for a full system including scanner)should appeal to a wide audience.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
