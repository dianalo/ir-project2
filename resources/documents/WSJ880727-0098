The crisis seems likely to turn deposit insurance, once a quiet political backwater, into a dangerous whirlpool, sucking in reluctant politicians.    The current examination, the most serious since the system was set up during the Depression, is already prompting proposals to scale back the once-sacrosanct insurance and to restructure much of the U.S. financial system. Banks and thrift institutions may lose some of the freedom they got through deregulation.    Although the more radical proposals are political castor oil, Congress and the next administration will face a growing clamor to do something once they realize that the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which insures thrift institutions' deposits, is virtually certain to require a costly bailout by taxpayers.    &quot;I would think that a new president will want to address this issue early on. It's one that could have explosive budget implications,&quot; says L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures bank deposits.    Closing insolvent Sandamp;Ls and banks could cost the government a budget-busting $30 billion at the minimum and possibly as much as $100 billion. But buckets of money alone won't solve what most experts view as the fundamental problem: Deposit insurance tends to cushion the mistakes and abuses committed in nearly a decade of deregulation.    &quot;We've created a system where the consumer is the lender of last resort,&quot; complains Charles John Koch, the chairman of the National Council of Savings Institutions. &quot;If an institution needs funds, it simply jacks up its rates, and the consumer goes merrily along. There's just no discipline.&quot;    Among consumers, the current insurance system, which guarantees about $3.5 trillion of deposits, has become an article of faith. Unconcerned about safety, they place their deposits based on convenience or high interest rates.    Although Congress will be loath to tamper with the current $100,000 coverage limit or to restrict the number of institutions in which an individual can place insured deposits, it will act when the U.S. Treasury starts writing checks, experts believe. Moreover, people &quot;don't want to put any money into this unless we have a system that will work,&quot; FDIC Chairman Seidman says, adding:   &quot;A deposit-insurance system is like a nuclear-power plant. If you build it without safety precautions, you know it's going to blow you off the face of the earth. And even if you do, you can't be sure it won't.&quot;    Some proposals being discussed by economists, regulators and industry groups amount to little more than rearranging the control-room dials.    But others envision the creation of new classes of institutions and the relegation of much of the banking system's current lending into uninsured affiliates, which would package loans into securities and sell them off. And a few brave souls suggest lowering deposit-insurance limits or restricting coverage to individuals -- excluding corporations, institutions or governmental bodies. They also favor limiting individuals to $100,000 of insurance instead of permitting $100,000 per deposit in an unlimited number of institutions.    Most proposals fall between these extremes. They call for such things as higher capital standards, tougher accounting rules and new powers for regulators to shut down institutions before they become insolvent.    Congress isn't likely to adopt any of the various proposals in full, but all are likely to shape the debate. The House and Senate banking committees recently held widely publicized hearings on the state of the FSLIC and are expected to continue studying the agency's problems all year. In addition, the FDIC is conducting a broad deposit-insurance study that is to be finished shortly after Election Day.    The trouble under such scrutiny now, by all accounts, stems from the deregulation of interest rates and investment powers in the early 1980s. Thrift institutions, particularly those chartered by California, Florida and Texas, were allowed to grow rapidly and invest government-insured deposits in a wide variety of risky ventures. The government's examiners, woefully understaffed and unskilled in evaluating the new investments, couldn't keep up with the legions of gunslinging thrift-institution owners attracted by the industry's new powers. The gunslingers' mistakes, exacerbated by fraud and an economic collapse in the Southwest, led to insolvencies.    Now, with the FSLIC lacking enough cash to shut down the nation's 500 insolvent thrift institutions and pay off their depositors, the problem is growing about $10 billion a year. That is because the interest on deposits in insolvent Sandamp;Ls and savings banks is accumulating far faster than their own interest income, which is held down by bad loans and other shaky assets.    Meanwhile, the FDIC is facing its own rising tide of trouble. Although far healthier than the already-insolvent FSLIC, the FDIC could be pushed under by a recession or a surge in interest rates. Nor could its $18 billion of reserves cover the problems of both funds if they were merged, as some experts suggest.    &quot;The FDIC could spend $18 billion tomorrow closing insolvent banks,&quot; says R. Dan Brumbaugh, a San Francisco consultant and former economist for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates Sandamp;Ls. &quot;The problem could easily become unmanageable if we siphon off FDIC funds to close thrifts but don't close insolvent banks.&quot;    Mr. Seidman expects the FDIC's reserves to drop about 10% this year, largely to close or bail out Texas banks. The FDIC, he admits, has &quot;weaknesses that could become fatal.&quot;    The system wasn't always weak. Established after a record 4,000 banks failed in 1933, deposit-insurance funds seemed to work flawlessly for nearly 50 years. Premiums paid by banks and thrift institutions, set at a tiny percentage of deposits, more than covered the handful of failures each year.    Fewer than 10 banks a year failed from 1943 to 1974. But bank failures jumped to 42 in 1982 and to 124 in 1985. Last year, 206 banks failed. This year, about 200 failures are expected.    The official count of thrift-institution failures shows a less alarming rise, to a postwar record of 71 in 1982. But those numbers don't include hundreds of insolvent institutions that the Bank Board has allowed to remain open because the FSLIC doesn't have the money to close them.    The system appeared to work well for so long because the government restricted the interest rates that banks and Sandamp;Ls could pay and their investment powers. In addition, the system was subsidized by big depositors, who got below-market rates or no interest at all, and by big corporate borrowers, which paid above-market rates for loans, says Lowell L. Bryan, a banking consultant with McKinsey andamp; Co. Those subsidies disappeared with the advent of money-market mutual funds, which drained deposits from the banking system, and with the explosion of the commercial-paper and junk-bond markets, which provided cheaper credit than banks did.    Deregulation allowed banks and Sandamp;Ls to compete with money-market funds in attracting deposits, but it heightened what economists call the &quot;moral hazard&quot; inherent in deposit insurance. The hazard: As a bank or Sandamp;L approaches insolvency, its owners and managers have every incentive to gamble on riskier loans and investments, hoping that some would pay off and put the institution back in the black. If the gambles fail, as they usually do, the big loser is the deposit-insurance fund because, at that point, the owners and managers have little left to lose.    So, most proposals seek to restore discipline to the financial system, either by relying on free-market forces or by improving supervision. They also seek to avoid reregulation. However, Congress might demand that because all the plans call for regulators to close insolvent thrifts and banks at huge cost. Although industry executives and regulators want to avoid tapping the Treasury, few observers except Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall believe that that is possible.    The major suggestions for a long-term solution fall into four main groups: &quot;narrow-bank&quot; plans, &quot;early-closure&quot; plans, &quot;higher-capital and better-supervision&quot; plans and &quot;reduced-coverage&quot; plans.    Narrow-Bank Plans   These plans, most often identified with Robert Litan of Washington's Brookings Institution and Mr. Bryan of McKinsey, would create a new type of institution that would invest insured deposits only in low-risk assets. These investments would include U.S. government securities and high-rated corporate-debt securities with short maturities or floating interest rates.    The narrow banks could be owned by holding companies with other financial-service units, including commercial finance companies that would make loans financed by uninsured deposits or borrowings. These uninsured finance units would resemble the lending subsidiaries of General Electric Co. or International Business Machines Corp., which raise funds by selling bonds and commercial paper (short-term IOUs). Mr. Bryan contends that such units could package their loans into securities and sell them to investors. Mr. Litan says a narrow bank could be the centerpiece of a financial supermarket, drawing in customers for its securities, insurance and real-estate units.    Both men carve out exceptions for existing banks reluctant to convert to the narrow-bank model, and Mr. Bryan also proposes a transition period of about five years. His plan also requires rapid advances in the cumbersome process of turning commercial-bank loans into securities. Although this so-called securitization has made much progress, he estimates that currently only 19% of all loans that could be securitized -- including home mortgages and consumer loans -- have been packaged that way.    Some skeptics term the narrow-bank plan too dependent on untested theories. &quot;I get very nervous when you make macro changes based on a piece of economic analysis,&quot; says Herbert M. Sandler, chairman of Golden West Financial Corp., a healthy thrift company in Oakland, Calif.    Early-Closure Plans -   These plans seek to minimize insurance-fund losses by closing failing banks and thrifts before they become deeply insolvent. Currently, regulators must wait until an institution's net worth becomes negative -- until its liabilities exceed its assets. The insurance funds then incur losses because they spend more to pay off depositors, whose accounts represent most of the liabilities, than they get from selling the assets, such as loans and real estate.    To remedy this, economists such as George J. Benston of Emory University in Atlanta and George G. Kaufman of Loyola University of Chicago suggest that regulators be allowed to close institutions when their capital -- net worth plus subordinated debt -- falls below 2% or 3% of assets.    They also suggest that capital standards be raised to about 10% of assets from the current 6% for banks and about 3% for thrift institutions. That, they say, would create a bigger cushion before institutions are in real danger. And they want banks and Sandamp;Ls to report the market value of their assets and liabilities quarterly. Such &quot;marking to market&quot; would tend to reduce reported capital because the assets usually include older loans whose market value declines if interest rates rise. Regulators and outside investors would be alerted to problems earlier.    However, skeptics believe that the constitutional due-process requirement might prevent regulators from closing a marginally solvent bank or Sandamp;L without a lengthy hearing. That could frustrate the goal of quick, loss-free closings.    Capital and Supervision   The high-capital and better-supervision approach, with variations, is favored by some executives of large, well-capitalized thrift institutions, including Mr. Sandler of Golden West, and by Paul M. Horvitz, a University of Houston economist and former FDIC research director.    Mr. Sandler stresses a need to improve examinations and supervision. Among other things, he says, regulators should get monthly computer data from institutions so that dangers can be spotted more quickly. With monthly data, he says, &quot;you can send people in immediately rather than waiting and going in every 18 months.&quot; The system also needs examiners who are &quot;intelligent, competent and have guts,&quot; he says.    Both Mr. Sandler and Mr. Horvitz also contend that regulators should get enough data to make a confidential quarterly estimate of the market value of institutions' assets, liabilities and net worth. This plan stops short of full mark-to-market accounting but should give ample warning of impending trouble.    Mr. Horvitz suggests that capital requirements for banks and Sandamp;Ls be raised to 8% to 10% of assets, approximately in line with international standards recently announced for banks. &quot;That would create the right incentives,&quot; he says. &quot;The institutions would be playing with their own money and not the government's.&quot;    Mr. Sandler believes that, for thrifts, capital requirements of 5% to 6% would suffice, with the standards tightly enforced to keep undercapitalized institutions from growing. Such controls would have prevented nearly all the recent big thrift-institution failures, he says. He also recommends that nontraditional activities, such as commercial real-estate development, be supported by higher levels of capital or be financed through a separate company without deposit insurance.    A variant of that idea calls for a sliding scale of deposit-insurance premiums, with institutions with more capital paying less. The Bank Board has already offered to cut premiums for thrift institutions whose capital exceeds 6% of liabilities. However, the industry's major trade group, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, has protested, arguing that the Bank Board lacks legal authority to impose variable-rate premiums.    The capital-based premium proposal is partly a descendant of an idea once favored by certain economists: risk-based premiums. The theory of charging higher premiums to banks and Sandamp;Ls that take bigger risks remains appealing, but regulators say it wouldn't work because it's too difficult to assess the risks accurately.    Reduced Coverage   These suggestions include limiting the coverage to individuals; barring insured accounts in more than one institution; covering perhaps only 75% of an insured deposit, as Britain does, to encourage depositors to monitor the institutions' safety, and encouraging private insurance plans for amounts above a certain level.    Mr. Brumbaugh, the consultant, suggests reducing coverage to a range of $25,000 to $40,000, which he says would protect &quot;the relatively poor and unsophisticated.&quot; He adds: &quot;The purpose of deposit insurance is to protect the payments system against runs, not to protect people who seek high returns with low risk.&quot;    Few thrift-institutions depositors need the full amount of insurance coverage. Bank Board data put the average thrift account at about $7,300, according to Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., consultant. Only about 13% of the thrift institutions' $962 billion of deposits is in accounts with balances of $80,000 to $100,000, he says. Such accounts number about 1.4 million, 1.3% of the 110 million total.    ---   One point on which practically all reformers agree: Congress should have tackled the deposit-insurance issue several years ago, when the problems were smaller.    &quot;We're talking about $50 billion to $60 billion of debt that the taxpayer will have to absorb,&quot; Emory University's Mr. Benston says. &quot;Until we get a crisis, it just isn't interesting {to Congress}. Now, we've got a crisis.&quot;    ---    Failures of insured institutions   Year      FDIC     FSLIC   1979        10         3   1980        10        11   1981        10        28   1982        42        71   1983        48        52   1984        79        27   1985       124        34   1986       145        49   1987       206        48   1988       108a       44a   a -- Year to date</TEXT></DOC>
