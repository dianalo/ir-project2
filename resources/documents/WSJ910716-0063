Although most economists say the recession is ending,efficiency-minded employers are keeping payrolls down. Citingcost cuts and sluggish farm and construction demand,equipment maker J.I. Case lays off 4,000 of 30,000 workers;parent Tenneco says the jobs won't return during therecovery. In similar restructuring, Monsanto made a 6% cutand Goodyear Tire's Celeron unit will trim staff by 22%.</LP><TEXT>   Encore Computer, Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., which pared 130 of1,825 jobs because of revamping costs, says the jobs &quot;won'tbe coming back anytime soon.&quot; Baker Hughes eliminated somejobs, though acquisitions helped boost employment. Manyclothing makers folded, and survivors such as HamptonIndustries, in Kinston, N.C., are rehiring; but Hamptonclosed a 160-worker shirt factory that won't reopen.   Due to brisk demand, Whirlpool has recalled all laid-offworkers in its Ohio laundry-product plants.                                                                                                          THE RECESSION has indeed affected many jobs, and benefits,too.   So shows a poll of 352 corporate officers by theInternational Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. Fully 34%said they permanently cut payrolls due to the recession.Nearly 20% plan permanent cuts soon -- including 41% of thosewho have made lasting reductions since September.   Some 23% said the recession affected benefits. Mostly,firms cut cost; they lifted the employees' share ofhealth-insurance premiums or claims costs, limited benefiteligibility for new workers or added managed-care programs,for instance. So, 41% said employee morale is down from ayear ago, while 15% said it's up.                                                                                                          RATING THE BOSS: More firms have workers do it, or maystart soon.   Cigna began supervisor evaluations in 1989; some managersget post-review training to strengthen weak points.Underlings especially want bosses to regard their personallives as important, says vice president Gerry Groe. Ben andamp;Jerry's Homemade and Lotus Development supervisors -- manyleery at first -- now welcome often painful feedback thatspotlights faults such as lack of concern for careerdevelopment.   Digital Equipment and auto parts dealer Pep Boys-Manny,Moe and Jack may start formal boss-performance reviews later-- &quot;to deal with employee-manager relationships of the 90s,&quot;Digital says. About 75% of bosses have bad traits: They don'tcommunicate or listen well, exert too much control and don'tset priorities, a survey of 191 workers by CommunicationBriefings, a newsletter, shows.   Legg Mason Wood Walker, Mack Trucks, and Sony's U.S. unitsee no need for workers to judge bosses.                                                                                                          SWITCHING THE LOAD: Fully 39% of about 500 corporationssurveyed by Alexander Consulting Group will boost or initiateemployee contributions to health plans this year; 13% did soin 1990. Some 49% will start or raise worker payments fordependent coverage, up from 18% last year.                                                                                                          MALE PRISON INMATES in New Jersey want privacy from femaleguards and the women guards want more access to jobs in maleunits, for faster promotion. Both sued. Under recentsettlements, curtains or &quot;modesty panels&quot; would be installedin showers and inmates' cells.                                                                                                          NOT MUCH THERE: Pennsylvania sues two firms, charging useof deceptive claims to sell lists of supposedly numerous jobprospects in Kuwait. Few of the listed firms have Kuwaiticontracts, and they only hire specialists, it says. Statesposted just 66 open jobs for Kuwait as of June 20, the U.S.Labor Department says.                                                                                                          NURSES' SALARIES rose at least 7.1% this year, including8% for new nurses and 13.1% for supervisors, says a Hay Groupsurvey for Modern Healthcare. The poll queried 211,772 nursesat 897 hospitals. Supervisors' pay is rising fast to matchstaff nurses' 1980s increases, the magazine said.                                                                                                          EMPLOYERS WORRY over safety of savings-fund holdings inGICs.   Fully 91% of 116 employers polled by consultant FosterHiggins say they're concerned about employee 401(k) or othersavings retirement plan money in guaranteed investmentcontracts after the Executive Life Insurance Co. ofCalifornia financial collapse. GICs promise set interestrates. The Executive Life failure jeopardized many of itsGICs or annuities bought by pension funds. The workers whosefunds go into GICs fret, too, 88% of the firms say.   About 23% of the firms will change their GIC selectionmethod, 11% plan tighter fiduciary control and half willdiscuss GICs more fully with employees. Foster Higgins' BrianTernoey expects more employers to develop formal policies forpicking GICs, or switch to other, &quot;super safe&quot; investments.   Recent class-action suits against some employers thatinvested savings funds in GICs will help spotlight the issue,Mr. Ternoey adds.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionfiles suit against Pat O'Brien's Bar in New Orleans, said tobe the world's largest, charging sex discrimination for nothiring women as waiters. . . . Union officials and somemembers at Du Pont's Martinsville, Va., nylon plant, intextile country, say they won't accept 50th plant-anniversaryjackets, made in Costa Rica. . . .
