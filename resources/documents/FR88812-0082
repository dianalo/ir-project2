Designation Process Glossary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Introduction: Scope and Purpose of Notice</ITAG>Section 401 of JTPA authorizes programs to serve the employment and trainingneeds of Indians and Native Americans.Requirements for these programs are set forth in JTPA and in the regulationsat 20 CFR Part 632. Pursuant to these requirements, the Department of Labor(DOL) selects entities for funding under JTPA section 401, and designatessuch entities as Native American grantees, contingent on all other grantaward requirements being met. This notice describes how DOL will make suchdesignation decisions for the period of Program Years (PYs) 1989 and 1990(July 1, 1989 through June 30, 1991). It provides necessary informationto prospective grant applicants to enable them to submit appropriate requestsfor designation.The amount of JTPA section 401 funds to be awarded to designated NativeAmerican grantees is determined under procedures described at 20 CFR 632.171and not through this designation process. The specific organization eligibilityand application requirements for designation are contained at 20 CFR 632.10and 632.11. Any organization interested in being designated as a NativeAmerican grantee should be aware of and comply with these requirements.I. General Designation PrinciplesBased on JTPA and applicable regulations, the following general principlesare intrinsic to the designation process:(1) Applicants for designation shall comply with the requirements foundat 20 CFR Part 632 regardless of their apparent standing in the preferentialhierarchy. The basic eligibility, application and designation requirementsare found in Subpart B of Part 632.(2) The nature of this program is such that Indians and Native Americansin an area are entitled to program services, and are best served by a responsibleorganization directly representing them and designated pursuant to theapplicable regulations. JTPA and the governing regulations give clear preferenceto Native American-controlled organizations. That preference is the basisfor the steps which will be followed in designating grantees.(3) A State-recognized or federally recognized tribe, band, or group onits reservation is given absolute preference over any other organizationif it has the capability to administer the program and meets all regulatoryrequirements. This preference applies only to the area within the reservationboundaries. A reservation organization which may have its service areagiven to another qualified organization for reasons specified in the regulationswill be given a future opportunity to reestablish itself as the designatedgrantee, should it so desire.In the event that such a tribe, band, or group (including an Alaskan Nativeentity) is not designated to serve such groups, the DOL will consult withthe governing body of such entities as provided at 20 CFR 632.10(e). Suchconsultation may be accomplished in writing, in person, or by telephone,as time and circumstances permit.(4) In designating Native American grantees for off-reservation areas,DOL will provide preference to Indian and Native American-controlled organizationsas described in 20 CFR 632.10(f) and as further clarified in this notice.(5) Special employment and training services for Indian and Native Americanpeople have been provided through an established service delivery networkfor the past fourteen years under the authority of JTPA Section 401 andits predecessor, section 302 of the repealed Comprehensive Employment andTraining Act (CETA). The DOL intends to exercise its designation authorityto preserve the continuity of such services and to prevent the undue fragmentationof existing service areas. Consistent with present regulations and otherprovisions of this notice, this will include preference for those NativeAmerican organizations with an existing capability to deliver employmentand training services within an established service area. Such preferencewill be identified through input from the Chief of DOL's Division of Indianand Native American Programs (DINAP) and the Director of DOL's Office ofSpecial Targeted Programs (OSTP), and through the use of the rating systemdescribed in this notice. Unless a non-incumbent applicant in the samepreferential hierarchy as an incumbent applicant grantee can demonstratethat it is significantly superior overall to the incumbent, the incumbentwill be designated, if it otherwise meets all of the requirements for redesignation.II. Advance Notice of IntentThe purpose of the Advance Notice of Intent process is to provide Section401 applicants, prior to the submission of a final Notice of Intent, withinformation relative to potential competition. While DOL encourages theresolution of competitive requests prior to final submission, the AdvanceNotice of Intent process also serve to alert those whose differences cannotbe resolved of the need to submit a complete final Notice of Intent.Although the Advance Notice of Intent process is not mandated by the regulations,participation in the advance process by prospective section 401 applicantsis strongly recommended. The Advance Notice of Intent process allows theapplicant to identify potential competitors, to resolve conflicts if possible,and to prepare a final Notice of Intent with advance knowledge of potentialcompeting requests.It should be emphasized, however, that the Advance Notice of Intent processdoes not ensure that all potential competitors have been identified. Someapplicants may opt not to submit an Advance Notice of Intent; others maychange service area requests in the final Notice of Intent. Therefore,as noted above, final submissions should be prepared with this possibilityin mind.By October 1 of the year preceding a designation year, all organizationsinterested in being designated as Section 401 grantees should submit anoriginal and two copies of an Advance Notice of Intent. An organizationmay submit only one Advance Notice of Intent for any and all areas forwhich it wants to be considered. Advance Notices are to be sent to thefollowing address: Mr. Herbert Fellman, Chief, Division of Indian and NativeAmerican Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-4641, 200 ConstitutionAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. Attention: ANOI/NOI Desk.The Standard Form (SF) 424 is no longer used for the advance notificationprocess. As in the PY 1987-1988 designation cycle, DOL will utilize theAdvance Notice of Intent. This allows DOL to expedite the identificationof potentially competitive applicants.Complete instructions will be mailed to all current grantees on or aboutAugust 15. Incumbents will also receive a description of their presentservice area at this time. New applicants may request copies of the AdvanceNotice instructions by writing to: Mr. Herbert Fellman, Chief, Divisionof Indian and Native American Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, RoomN-4641, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210.The first step in the designation process is to determine which areas havemore than one potential applicant for designation. For those areas forwhich more than one organization submits an Advance Notice of Intent, eachsuch organization will be notified of the situation, and will be apprisedof the identity of the other organization(s) applying for that area. Suchnotification will consist of providing affected applicants with copiesof all Advance Notices of Intent submitted for their area. The notificationwill occur on or about November 15. The notification will state that organizationsare encouraged to work out any jurisdictional disputes among themselves,and to submit a final Notice of Intent by the required postmark or handdelivered deadlines or withdraw their Advance Notice.Under the Advance Notice of Intent process, it is DOL policy that to theextent possible within the regulations, service areas and the organizationsoperating in those areas be determined by the community to be served bythe program. In the event the Native American community cannot resolvedifferences, the notification will inform parties that they should takespecial care with their final Notices of Intent to ensure that they arecomplete and fully responsive to all matters covered by the preferentialhierarchy and rating systems discussed in this notice. Information provided in the Advance Notice of Intent process shall notbe considered as a final submission as referenced at 20 CFR 632.11. TheAdvance Notice is a procedural mechanism to facilitate the designationprocess. The regulations do not provide for formal application for designationthrough the Advance Notice. III. Notice of Intent All applicants will submit an original and two copies of a final Noticeof Intent, postmarked no later than January 1, 1989, consistent with theregulations at 20 CFR 632.11. Final Notices of Intent may also be deliveredin person not later than the close of business on the first business dayof the designation year. <T3>Exclusive of charts or graphs and letters of support, the Notice ofIntent should not exceed 75 pages of double-spaced unreduced type. </T3>Final Notices of Intent are to be sent to the following address: Mr. HerbertFellman, Chief, Division of Indian and Native American Programs, U.S. Departmentof Labor, Room N-4641, 200 Constitution Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20210.Attention: ANOI/NOI Desk. The regulations permit current grantees requesting their existing serviceareas to submit a Standard Form 424 in lieu of a complete application.As noted earlier in this notice, current grantees, other than tribes, bands,or groups (including Alaskan Native entities) requesting their existingareas, are encouraged to consider submitting a full Notice of Intent evenif their service area request has not changed. Although organizations are encouraged to alter their area requests to minimizeor avoid overlap with other organizations, they should not add territoryto that identified in the Advance Notice of Intent. Unless currently designatedfor such areas, any organization applying on January 1 for noncontiguousareas shall prepare a separate, complete Notice of Intent for each sucharea. It is the DOL's policy that no information affecting the panel review processwill be solicited or accepted past the regulatory postmarked or hand delivereddeadlines (see Part V, Use of Panel Review Procedure, below). All informationprovided before the deadline must be in writing. IV. Preferential Hierarchy for Determining Designations In cases in which only one organization is applying for a clearly identifiedgeographic area and the organization meets the requirements at 20 CFR 632.10(b)and 632.11(d), DOL shall designate the applying organization as the granteefor the area. In cases in which two or more organizations apply for thesame or an overlapping area, DOL will utilize the order of designationpreference described in the hierarchy below. The organization which fallsinto the highest category of preference will be designated, assuming allother requirements are met. The preferential hierarchy is: (1) <T3>Indian tribes, bands, or groups on Federal or State reservations fortheir reservation; Oklahoma Indians (see Part VII, Special DesignationSituations, below); and Alaskan Native entities (see Part VII, SpecialDesignation Situations, below). </T3>(2) <T3>Native American-controlled, community-based organizations with significantsupport from other Native American-controlled organizations within thecommunity for their existing DOL designated service area and all non-incumbentNative American-controlled, community-based organizations that are challengingsuch incumbents or seeking to serve areas for which the incumbent is notre-applying. </T3>Non-incumbent organizations must submit evidence of significantsupport from other Native American-controlled organizations within thecommunity. Competition shall occur only when a non-incumbent can demonstrate in itsapplication, by verifiable information, that it is potentially significantlysuperior overall to the incumbent. Such potential will be determined bythe consideration of such factors as the following: completeness of theapplication; documentation of past experience and Native American-controlledorganizational support; and the capability of the incumbent. In the instanceof no incumbent, new applicants qualified for this category would competeagainst each other. (3) <T3>Organizations (private nonprofit or units of State or local government)having a significant Native American advisory process, such as a governingbody chaired by a Native American and having a majority membership of NativeAmericans. </T3>(4) <T3>Non-Native American-controlled organizations without a Native Americanadvisory process. </T3>In the event such an organization is designated,it must subsequently develop a Native American advisory process. The Chief, DINAP, may convene a task force to assist in making hierarchaldeterminations. The task force also may perform such technical and advisoryfunctions as determining which areas have more than one applicant for designation,documenting the eligibility of new applicants, and ascertaining the timelinessof final Notice of Intent submissions. The role of the task force is thatof a technical advisory body. The Chief, DINAP, will ultimately advise the Grant Officer in referenceto which position an organization holds in the hierarchy. Within the regulatorytime constraints of the designation process, the Chief, DINAP will utilizewhatever information is available. The applying organization must supply sufficient information to permitthe determination to be made. Organizations must indicate the categorywhich they assume is appropriate and must adequately support that assertion.As indicated earlier, applicants will not be able to provide any informationpast the January 1 postmark on hand delivered deadlines, and no informationwill be solicited by DINAP.V. Use of Panel Review ProcedureCompetition may occur under the following circumstances:(1) The Chief, DINAP, advises that a new applicant qualified for the secondcategory of the hierarchy appears to be potentially significantly superioroverall to an incumbent Native American-controlled, community-based organizationwith significant local Native American community support.(2) The Chief, DINAP, advises that more than one new applicant is qualifiedfor the second category of the hierarchy, and the incumbent grantee hasnot re-applied for designation.(3) The Chief, DINAP, advises that two or more organizations have equalstatus in the third or fourth categories of the hierarchy.When competition occurs, the Grant Officer may convene a review panel ofFederal officials to score the information submitted with the Notice ofIntent. The purpose of the panel is to evaluate an organization's capability,based on its application, to serve the area in question. The panel willbe provided only the information described at 20 CFR 632.11 and submittedwith the final Notice of Intent. The panel results will be advisory tothe Grant Officer, not binding. In reviewing information submitted by theorganization, the panel will not accept simple assertions. Any informationmust be supported by adequate and verifiable documentation.The factors listed below will be considered in evaluating the capabilityof the applicant. In developing the Notice of Intent, the applicant shouldorganize his documentation of capability to correspond with these factors.(1) Operational Capability_40 points (20 CFR 632.10 and 632.11).(i) Previous experience in successfully operating an employment and trainingprogram serving Indians or other Native Americans of a scope comparableto that which the organization would operate if designated_20 points.(ii) Previous experience in operating other human resouces developmentprograms serving Indians or other Native Americans or coordinating employmentand training services with such programs_10 points.(iii) Ability to maintain continuity of services to Indian or other NativeAmerican participants with those previously provided under JTPA_10 points.(2) Applicant's Understanding and Program Approach to Fulfilling the Trainingand Employment Objectives of JTPA Section 401_20 points. (20 CFR 632.2).(3) Planning Process_20 points. (20 CFR 632.11).(i) Private sector involvement_10 points.(ii) Community support as defined below in Part VIII, <T3>Designation Process Glossary</T3>_10 points.(4) Administrative Capability_20 points. (20 CFR 632.11).(i) Previous experience in administering public funds under DOL or similaradministrative requirements_15 points.(ii) Experience of senior management staff to be responsible for DOL grant,if designated_5 points.VI. Notification of Designation/Nondesignation:The Grant Officer will make the final designation decision giving considerationto the following factors: the review panel's recommendation, in those instancesin which a panel is convened; input from DINAP, OSTP, the Office of Financialand Administrative Management, and the Office of the Inspector General;and any other available information regarding the organization's responsibility.The Grant Officer's decisions will be provided to all applicants by March1, as follows:(1) <T3>Designation Letter.</T3> The designation letter signed by the GrantOfficer will serve as official notice of an organization's designation.The letter will include the service area for which the designation is made.It should be noted that the Grant Officer is not required to adhere tothe geographic area requested in the final Notice of Intent. The GrantOfficer may make the designation applicable to all of the area required,a portion of the area requested, or, if acceptable to the designee, morethan the area requested.(2) <T3>Conditional Designation Letter.</T3> Conditional designations willinclude the nature of the conditions, the actions required to be finallydesignated and the time frame for such actions to be accomplished.(3) <T3>Non-designation Letter. </T3>Any organization not designated, in wholeor in part, for an area requested will be notified formally of the non-designationand given the basic reasons for the determination. An applicant for designationthat is refused such designation, in whole or in part, may file a Petitionfor Reconsideration in accordance with 20 CFR 632.13. If an area is notdesignated for service through the foregoing process, alterantive arrangementsfor service will be made in accordance with 20 CFR 632.12.  VII. Special Designation Situations  <ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Alaskan Native Entities  </ITAG>DOL has established service areas for Alaskan Native employment and trainingprograms based on the following: the boundaries of the regions definedin the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA); the boundaries of majorsubregional areas where the primary provider of human resource developmentand related services is an Indian Reorganization Act (IRA)-recognized tribalcouncil; and the boundaries of the Federal reservation in the State. Withinthese established service areas, DOL has designated the primary AlaskanNative-controlled human resource development services provider or an entityformally designated by such provider. These entities have been regionalnonprofit corporations, associated corporations established by the regionalnonprofit corporation, IRA-recognized tribal councils and the tribal governmentof the Metlakatla Indian Community. DOL intends to follow these principlesin designating Native American grantees in Alaska for Program Years 1989-1990. <ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Oklahoma Indians  </ITAG>DOL has established a service delivery system for Indian employment andtraining programs in Oklahoma based on a preference for Oklahoma Indiansto serve portions of the State. Generally, service areas have been designatedgeographically as countrywide areas. In cases in which a significant portionof the land area of an individual county lies within the traditional jurisdictionof more than one tribal government, the service area has been subdividedto a certain extent on the basis of tribal identification information inthe most recent Federal Decennial Census of Population. However, in casesin which members of many different tribes reside in a given county, noattempt has been made to apportion those members among all of the respectivetribes. Wherever possible, arrangements mutually satisfactory to granteesin adjoining or overlapping service areas have been honored by DOL. DOLintends to follow these principles in designating Native American granteesin Oklahoma for Program Years 1989 and 1990 to preserve continuity andprevent unnecessary fragmentation.  <T3>VIII. Designation Process Glossary:  </T3>In order to ensure that all interested parties have the same understandingof the process, the following definitions are provided:  <ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Indian or Native American-Controlled Organization  </ITAG>This is defined as any organization with a governing board, more than 50percent of whose members are Indian or other Native American people. Suchan organization can be a tribal government, Native Alaskan or Native Hawaiientity, consortium, or public or private non-profit agency. The governingboard must have decision making authority for the section 401 program. <ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Service Area  </ITAG>This is defined as the geographic area described as States, counties, and/orreservations for which a designation is made. In some cases, it will alsoshow the specific population to be served. The service area is definedfinally by the Grant Officer in the formal designation letter. Granteesmust ensure that all eligible population members have equitable accessto employment and training services within the service area.  <ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Established Service Area  </ITAG>This is the area defined by geography or service population which DOL haspreviously designated as a service area for Indian and other Native AmericanJTPA purposes.  <ITAG tagnum="81">(4) Community Support  </ITAG>This is evidence of active participation and/or endorsement from Indianor other Native American-controlled organizations within the geographicarea for which designation is requested. Applicants should provide supportingdocumentation regarding the nature of such organizations, e.g., evidenceof Indian and other Native American control, articles of incorporationor charter, size, membership, etc.  While applicants are not precluded from submitting attestations of supportfrom individuals, the business community, State and local government offices,and community organizations that are not Indian or other Native American-controlled,they should be aware that such endorsements do not meet DOL's definitionalcritical for community support.  <ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 4th day of August, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul A.
