<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-55-0516 </DOCNO><TEXT>The helium microwave plasma, particularly at atmospheric pressure usinga Beenakker cavity, shows a great deal of promise as a gas chromatographicdetector because of its ability to detect a very wide range of elements,both metal and non-metal, such as sulfur gases, carbonates in coal flyash, heavy metal salts, tetraalkyl leads, and volatile organo-mercurycompounds. By incorporating a polychromator as a part of the instrument,one can derive the benefits of simultaneous, multi-element detectionsuch as higher speed of analysis and smaller sample requirements. Thispaper describes a helium microwave plasma detector for gas chromatographythat was developed by the authors. 7 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
