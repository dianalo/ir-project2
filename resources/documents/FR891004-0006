The new exemption applies to sales in subdivisions (as that term isdefined by the Act) of 100 or more lots that are created by the continualacquisition and disposal of lots in geographically scattered locationswhich, unless extraordinary steps are taken, are offered under one commonpromotional plan and are, therefore, subject to registration. However,because of the very nature of these types of operations that are constantlyacquiring tracts of land in scattered and diverse parts of the country,registration is impractical from both the registrant's and the registeringagency's standpoint.The new exemption allows developers of these subdivisions to operate withoutthe necessity of maintaining a registration or taking the steps requiredto avoid operating under one common promotional plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2><T3>Effective Date:</T3> Under section 7(o)(3) of the Department of Housingand Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(o)(3)), this final rule cannotbecome effective until after the first period of 30 calendar days of continuoussession of Congress which occurs after the date of the rule's publication.HUD will publish a notice of the effective date of this rule followingexpiration of the 30-session-day waiting period.

The public reporting burdenfor each of these collections of information is estimated to include thetime for reviewing and instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information.

The Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1701through 1720, authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Developmentto issue and amend Regulations implementing the Act. This rule will providerelief from the registration requirements placed upon certain developersby creating the ``Multiple Site Subdivision Exemption''. This exemptionwill permit developers of numerous sites of fewer than 100 lots each topromote and sell the revolving inventory of lots under a single commonpromotional plan without registration by simply meeting certain eligibilityrequirements which are, for the most part, already characteristic of theofferings, and by providing general information about real estate ownershipalong with a minimum of information about specific lots. The new exemption is a regulatory exemption and could be listed in 24CFR 1710.14 but, because of the unique character of this exemption, itis being added as a new andSection; 1710.15, Regulatory Exemption_MultipleSite Subdivision_Determination Required. The termination provisions of24 CFR 1710.16(f) are included in the new section, as are the anti-fraudprovisions of 24 CFR 1710.4 (b) and (c).<ITAG tagnum="84">Response to Public Comment</ITAG>On August 12, 1988 the Department published its proposed rule (53 FR 30443)authorizing this special exemption. Public comments concerning the proposalwere generally favorable. The specific comments received, and the Department'sresponse to them are set forth below.Seven comments were received and evaluated by the Department. These commentsresulted in some revisions to the proposed rule. Several technical changeswere made to include references to andSection; 1710.15 where applicable.Several corrections were made to change incorrect citations and spellings.Several comments were received that implied that HUD was changing its policyin regard to other existing exemptions or offering amendments to them.One commenter believed that HUD was limiting the application of the ``100-lot''exemption in light of the common promotional plan concept. HUD does notintend to change its application of any existing exemption, or to modifythe definition of a common promotional plan. The new exemption is neitherintended to apply to subdivisions clearly qualifying for the ``100-lot''exemption nor is it intended to cover those with fewer than 25 lots. Lotsthat qualify for the statutory exemptions under andSection; 1710.5 will notbe counted for purposes of the new exemption.Another commenter suggested that the scattered site exemption (andSection;1710.8) be amended to delete the limitation to prior ownership of 20 lots.Since the less than 25 lot exemption (andSection; 1710.5(a)) and the 100-lotexemption (andSection; 1710.6) are statutorily mandated, they cannot be changedthrough this rule. The exemption in this rule is not intended to coverthe limited nature of offerings for the specific types of subdivisionsqualifying for those exemptions.Another commenter asked whether the exemption could be used in conjunctionwith other exemptions. HUD will treat sales qualifying for the andSection;1710.5 exemptions as being eligible for use in conjunction with the exemptionset forth in this rule.Two commenters asked for a definition of the word ``adjacent'' as usedin the proposed andSection; 1710.15(a)(2). It was decided to change the wordto ``contiguous'' in this final rule to maintain conformity in the Regulationssince that word is defined and used in other parts of the Regulations.The most frequent comment related to the new andSection; 1710.15(a)(2), whichdisqualifies the sale of lots within a subdivision established by a separatedeveloper. Five comments were received recommending removal of this provision.The final rule retains the provision. The new exemption is intended forthose developers that continually acquire numbers of scattered sites withlimited sales and not those acquiring lots in established subdivisions.Established subdivisions are normally structured to some degree and arecharacterized by a plan that contains use restrictions on the land, facilitiesand amenities; fees; property owners associations; architectural controlcommittees; planned or existing facilities and amenities; liens and mortgages;and other not-readily-apparent characteristics. It is felt that purchasersfrom a secondary developer_who may or may not be responsible for any ofthe planned or established subdivision structure_sorely need full disclosureof all these possible hidden factors to assure that they are aware of allconditions, along with the total cost impact, before they purchase a lotand unwittingly become financially obligated or physically involved in(or constricted by) circumstances imposed on lot owners.Another commenter asked under what circumstances a developer was deemedto have ``other evidence of intent,'' as stated in andSection; 1710.15(a)(2),to acquire land that could disqualify lots in a site from the exemption.No specific definition is anticipated, since we do not intend to restrictthe methods by which future acquisitions can be made.A similar comment suggested that lots purchased from a previous developerbe allowed to qualify if none had been sold, if certain county approvalshad been obtained and restrictions had been recorded. Under these rarecircumstances, HUD will consider making a case-by-case determination ifrequested under andSection; 1710.16.Another comment suggested adding additional lot sales situations that couldqualify for the exemption. None of these situations has been included inthis rule since these suggestions are already covered by other exemptions.Furthermore, such comments are outside the scope of the rule.Three comments were received regarding andSection; 1710.15(b)(1), which requireslots to be sold in ``as is'' condition with all advertised improvementsor amenities completed and in the condition advertised. The comments requestedthat HUD allow lots to qualify where there are uncompleted improvementsor amenities, provided that certain assurances, such as bonds, escrow funds,letters of credit or performance bonds exist. Another mentioned that adeveloper may not be able to deliver telephone service and electricityto certain lots until there is a substantial demand.The rule's requirement is not being changed, since the exemption does notrequire a developer to complete any improvements or amenities. Subdivisionswith completed facilities may qualify for the single family residence exemption.Furthermore, the issuance of bonds or other assurances does not necessarilyguarantee the completion of facilities, since state law requirements forbonding vary widely. It also would be burdensome for HUD to keep currentas to the status of the bonds, or to determine the amount necessary tocomplete such improvements and amenities.Therefore, if a developer places an advertisement for lot sales under theexemption, it can only refer to those improvements and amenities that arecompleted. Developers advertising lots as homesites or building lots shouldmake certain that lots meet the criteria set forth in andSection; 1715.20(i).Two comments were received regarding the access to a lot, both legallyand physically, by a road suitable for use by automobile, as stated inandSection; 1710.15(b)(3) of the rule. One requested that HUD consider exemptinglots that were inaccessible by automobile, such as island property or unimprovedsportsmen's preserves. Another suggested that the term ``automobile'' beamended to ``conventional passenger automobile''.Based upon the comments received and other available information, the Departmentrealizes that a significant number of sites that would otherwise qualifyfor the new exemption (and that were intended to be eligible for the exemption)would be disqualified if the physical access requirement was limited to``automobile''. Therefore, except as noted below, the term ``automobile''has been removed.The exception is for lots which are advertised or otherwise representedas ``residential'', either primary or secondary, with any inference thata permanent or temporary dwelling unit of any description (excluding collapsibletents) can be built or installed. In such cases there must be physicalaccess by automobile, pick-up truck or equivalent ``on-road'' vehicle.A comment was received regarding the title assurance provision of andSection;1710.15(b)(4), requesting that HUD allow exceptions to be approved in writingby the purchaser before the time of closing. This procedure would be acceptable,provided that the actual title binder, policy or opinion is current atthe time of closing and shows that title is vested in the seller. Thisconforms with a similar requirement for the single family residence exemption(see part V(e)(3)(vii) of the Exemption Guidelines, published August 6,1984 in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and included as appendix A to 24 CFR part 1700).With respect to andSection; 1710.15(b)(5), it was suggested that the actualrescission language be set forth in the rule. The same comment also suggestedthat the term ``date of sale'' be changed to ``date the purchaser signedthe contract.'' This suggestion has been accepted. The section has beenrewritten to include the actual rescission language and to refer to thedate of signing the contract where applicable instead of the date of sale.Two comments were received on the requirement in andSection; 1710.15(b)(6)relating to the on-the-lot inspection. These comments suggested that parentsor legal guardians be allowed to make onsite inspections for children andminors; that purchasers refusing to visit be permitted to sign a waiver;and that sales be exempted in cases where a purchaser exchanges an originallyunseen lot for another lot after visiting the subdivision and receivingdisclosure information.The Department feels that the requirement should remain as written. Thisconforms to the on-the-lot inspection requirement of other exemptions,such as the single-family residence, intrastate and SMSA exemptions. Anydeviation from this requirement would deny the purchaser the opportunityto view the exact lot he or she is purchasing and to make a rational decisionon whether or not to purchase the lot.A comment was received that suggested that the language ``or until escrowagent determines that the deed has been duly recorded'' be inserted after``developer'' in andSection; 1710.15(b)(7). This suggestion was based on``long costly delays'' allegedly incurred by developers awaiting the returnof recorded deeds from local recorders.This comment has been rejected, since it is unlikely that the rule's requirementwill result in the delay of delivery of the deed. The term ``delivery ofdeed'' is defined in Part II(c) of the Exemption Guidelines as ``the physicaltransfer of a recordable deed, executed by the seller to the purchaser,to the purchaser's agent or to the appropriate governmental recording office.''In regard to andSection; 1710.15(b)(8), a comment was received about thedisclosure of taxes in the Lot Information Statement for new subdivisions.It was suggested that the last tax bill available or the newly appraisedtax value of the lot be used, since the taxing officials may not have madean estimate for taxes when the lots were offered for sale. This rule doesnot require exact figures. Estimates that the developer makes based uponthe best available information are acceptable for purposes of the new exemption.One commenter brought to HUD's attention several technical errors in theproposed rule that have been corrected. These included the removal of referencesto telephone and fuel in andSection; 1710.15(b)(9), since they were not referredto in andSection; 1710.15(b)(11). References to andSection; 1710.15 (b)(9)and (b)(10) andSection; 1710.15(b)(11) have been changed to andSection; 1710.15(b)(8) and (b)(9).In further reference to andSection; 1710.15(b)(11), the same commenter questionedwhether the signature line on the bottom line of the receipt for the LotInformation Statement was for the salesperson or the purchaser. The samplereceipt has been revised to contain the designated signature line for boththe salesperson and purchaser. Based upon advice from the Office of Management and Budget, the Departmenthas decided to eliminate a specific printed form for the Lot InformationStatement, and has substituted a format, to avoid the time involved torespond to any changes and the cost of regulatory amendments. Therefore,a sample format for the Lot Information Statement and a description ofrequired disclosures is provided.Four comments were received in regard to the filing fee and request procedurerequired in proposed andSection; 1710.15(c). One commenter suggested thatthe $500 filing fee be reduced to $50 per lot for subdivisions with lessthan 10 lots. This comment on the fee has not been accepted, since theexemption is for a method of operation rather than for a set number oflots. Developers eligible for the exemption will not know the total numberof lots to be offered at the time of filing, since they are continuallyacquiring and selling lots as they are located and, if necessary, platted.Other commenters questioned the necessity of a burdensome clearing processand asked why the new exemption is not self-determining. HUD believes thatcertain judgment decisions must be made because of the unique nature ofthe offerings that will be eligible for the new exemption. Therefore, itis essential that the exemption requirements be uniformly applied fromthe outset. Another comment suggested that the ``Agent'' caption on the ``Request forMultiple Site Exemption'' form be expanded to state ``Agent for purposesof notices or correspondence in connection with this Request.'' HUD doesnot believe that this change is necessary in light of the andSection; 1710.1definition of the term ``Agent.''A comment was also received suggesting a change in a statement in the Requestfor Multiple Site Exemption located in parentheses directly below the agent'stelephone number. Certain revisions have been made in response to thiscomment.A comment was received regarding the termination of the exemption for failureto submit the Annual Report, as required by andSection; 1710.15(d)(4). Thiscommenter felt that termination should only occur after a notice is issuedand an opportunity for hearing is given. The provision has been revisedto give the developer 10 days after the receipt of notice from the Secretaryto file the Annual Report. Otherwise, the exemption will be terminated.In regard to the termination of the Exemption Order under andSection; 1710.15(e),a commenter suggested that such termination apply only to the affectedsite or sites, rather that the entire offering. Since this exemption appliesto the entire sales operation and not to individual sites within that operation,this suggestion has not been accepted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding and Certifications</ITAG>A finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD Regulations in 24 CFR part which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection from 8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, in the Officeof the Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order of Federal Regulation issued bythe President on February 10, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, state or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.The collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paper ReductionAct of 1980. Sections 1710.15, 1710.15(d) and 1710.15(b)(11) of this rulehave been determined by the Department to contain collection of informationrequirements.

Congress provided several specificexemptions from the Act, and from the registration requirements of theAct, for identified small entities. In 15 U.S.C. 1702(c), Congress alsodirected the Department to create, by regulation, additional exemptionsfor small entities whose offerings are of a small amount or limited character.This exemption is being promulgated pursuant to that authority. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.801.HUD has determined, in accordance with E.O. 12612, <T3>Federalism, </T3>that this rule does not have a substantial, directeffect on the States or on the relationship between the Federal Governmentand the States, or on the distribution of power or responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. The rule provides an exemption, underspecified conditions, from otherwise applicable registration requirements,to private entities subject to the Interstate Land Sales Full DisclosureAct. Provision of such an exemption is expressly authorized by statute.HUD has determined that this rule is not likely to have a significant impacton family formation, maintenance, and general well-being within the meaningof E.O. 12606, <T3>The Family, </T3>because it does not affect the role or institutionof the family in society. The rule provides a specific exemption from registrationrequirements for particular types of transactions under the InterstateLand Sales Full Disclosure Act. Any impact on the institution of the familyin society is most indirect and most minimal.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 1710</ITAG>Consumer protection, Land sales, reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, 24 CFR part 1710 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1710_LAND REGISTRATION</ITAG>1.
