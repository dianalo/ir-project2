Guests on tonight's NBC-TV show include Billy Crystal, SusanSarandon, Graham Parker and Los Angeles Lakers coach Pat Reilly.   As of Monday, Letterman was expecting to come back without hiswriters, though the show's producers were trying to work out aguild waiver that would allow the writing staff to work.   Head writer Steve O'Donnell stressed last week that whether ornot they were at work, Letterman was going on the air with thewriters' blessings and in no way was trying to disadvantage theguild, of which Letterman is a member.   ``We've been having meetings all week and we've decided the bestthing is to get the show on the air,'' O'Donnell said.   Letterman is not violating the strike as long as he writes hisown material, which he will do if his writers aren't allowed backto work.   Johnny Carson, host of NBC's ``Tonight Show,'' returned to theair last month with Carson writing his own monologue.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Victoria Sellers, daughter of actress BrittEklund and the late Peter Sellers, was ordered to undergocounseling for violating probation imposed for her role in acocaine ring.
