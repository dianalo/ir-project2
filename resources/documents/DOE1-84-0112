The stress pattern acting onsuch components varies widely according to operating conditions. Theauthor first describes the demands which such engineering materials,have to meet and then cites a number of examples where heat-resistantcast steel can be used to advantage. The author finally points to thepossibility of improving operational economy of such furnaces by reducingthe volume of structural members.</TEXT></DOC>
