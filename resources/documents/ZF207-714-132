(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The most complete and flexible of the LAN remote control and monitoringpackages we reviewed, Close-Up/LAN is more than just a screen-monitofingprogram.andP;  Running with equal efficiency on local area networks based onNovell's NetWare and NetBIOS, the $795 (for eight users) version of thispackage from Norton-Lambert Corp.andP;  feawres extremely robust resource-sharingcapabilities.andM;Close-Up/LAN allows users to engage in every combination of multiple-stationmonitored and monitoring operation; oneto-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, andmany-to-many connections are all available.andM;It lets users establish themselves on both the giving and receiving ends ofshared resources and support.andP;  With it, a viewer (as the package terms theuser who does the monitoring or controlling) can be in the middle of helpingsomeone with a software problem and request help from another user withouthaving to exit the program and run a separate host (the package's term for astation being viewed or controlled) software module, This givingand-receivingcapability also allows users to exceed the package's single-station limit of16 connections by daisy-chaining.andM;Close-Up/LAN runs on either the Novell IPX or the NetBIOS network transportprotocol.andP;  During installation, the product examines the network and decideswhich protocol is available, so you don't have to specify the drivers thepackage should use.andP;  Support for Close-Up/LAN begins with excellentdocumentation and continues with a technical support hotline.andM;Close-Up/LAN's Viewer program is a TSR that takes from 66K to 78K of RAM on aNetWare IPX network and from 86K to 98K of RAM using NetBIOS.andP;  You can hotkeyin and out of Close-UpILAN from any application; its pull-down menu displaysthe available hosts.andM;As a viewer, you have access to the resources of up to 16 PCs running theHost TSR.andP;  If you need to use the 386 machine and modem down the hall, youcan easily connect to them as long as they're on the network, signed in ashosts, and give you permission.andP;  Close-Up/LAN is especially good at sharingthe printers connected over wide area networks, allowing you to have multipleprinting locations working simultaneously.andM;Whether the viewer is using the resources of a remote host or aiding a hostin using software, the viewer-host connection can be made without disruptingthe work at the host station.andP;  The host operator receives a beep when aviewer connects, but the screen and keystrokes on the host machine don't slowdown an appreciable amount.andP;  For classroom purposes, the viewer's menuincludes feawres for disabling the keyboard and screen of the host.andP;  Theviewer's menu also allows you to switch back and forth between hosts easilyand to end the connection between all or some specific hosts.andM;DEFENDING PRIVACYandM;With Close-Up/LAN, the host has the ability to defend his or her privacy.andO;Loaded by the host TSR (which occupies up to 53K), the host's menu containsoptions to disconnect viewers from the host PC, to require a password, and toset up a private mode so that only designated viewers can access the host PC.andO;You can save these options through the host's setup menu.andP;  As host, you havethe power to initiate or ten-ninate the connection, so you can request helpfrom a viewer instead of waiting for one to call.andP;  The host's menu can alsoset up parameters so that viewers can view the host PC's screen but cannotuse remote control.andP;  A total of 16 hosts can connect to one or m ore vie wers.andM;The Dialog feature enhances CloseUp/LAN with its chat/communicate function.andO;Once a user, either a viewer or a host, initiates a connection to anotherviewer or host, the Dialog option becomes available.andP;  Appearing as a 2-inchbox on the screen (you can move it around if it appears in the way of theapplication you're viewing), the chat box does exactly what you'd expect,letting you converse without using the telephone.andM;LEADER OF THE PACKandM;Our performance test results confirm Close-Up/LAN's &quot;leader of the pack&quot;position.andP;  Like D-Link Screen Monitor and LAN Assist Plus, Close-UpILANsamples the screen on the host machine and transmits only changes; it doesn'tflood the network with unnecessary data.andP;  With CloseUp/LAN, you can changethe &quot;time slice,&quot; or sampling rate, of the host program.andP;  If the host'sscreen doesn't change often, you can set a low sampling rate and leave theperformance of the host's CPU relatively unaffected.andM;Given all of the features it offers as well as its impressive performance,you'd expect to pay a lot for Close- Up/LAN-and indeed, it is probably themost expensive package we reviewed.andP;  It is the only product to be sold &quot;peruser,&quot; so its price can't be compared directly with the prices of itscompetition, but the most expensive among the others is $795, and whileClose-Up/LAN starts at $395 for two users, it costs $795 for eight users,$995 for 16, $1,495 for 32, and $1,995 for 64.andP;  Meanwhile, you could have 64users on any of the other &quot;per LAN&quot; priced products for $795 orless.andM;Nonetheless, we believe that CloseUp/LAN's pricing is justified by itscapabilities, its likely longevity, and by the high level of supportNorton-Lambert makes available.andP;  It is an excellent choice for any workgrouprequiring everything today's monitoring and control packages are able toprovide.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
