Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Computerized buy and sell programs continued to whipsaw stock prices yesterday, but investor concern over tomorrow's scheduled release of trade figures showed some signs of easing.    The result was a 3.82-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average to 1924.73. Volume was light at 154 million shares compared with 165.7 million shares in Tuesday's session. Advancing issues outpaced decliners 816-720.    Computerized sell programs drove prices down sharply at the opening, but by midsession the Dow Jones average had recovered its losses and buy programs were propelling the market toward a gain of more than 20 points. The gain was lost in a sharp retreat in the last half hour of trading.    The program trading, which occurs when computers automatically buy or sell stocks to take advantage of price differences between the stocks themselves and futures contracts based on stock indexes, is widely blamed for the low volume of recent trading sessions. Market professionals assert that the volatility created by such trading is frightening portfolio managers and smaller investors who are looking for some stability in the stock market.    &quot;Most professionals are pretty disgusted trying to trade in a market that's dominated by professional arbitragers,&quot; said Fred Lange, who owns a money-management firm in New York. &quot;These arbitragers have no real risk and have no regard for the investment community at all. They aren't making real investment decisions; these are just decisions being made by a mindless computer.&quot;    But William Marcus, vice president of the options and futures department at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, said the criticisms of program trading may be misplaced. For one thing, he said it is well documented that volatility increases in a declining market in any case. Further, he said the effects of buy or sell programs appear exaggerated on quiet days. And he said that when investors are uncertain about what factors are driving a market, they look for something on which to focus their attention and program trading appears to be the current favorite topic.    &quot;If the uncertainty surrounding the dollar and the fundamentals weren't so high, you wouldn't see any sell programs,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a reflection of negative sentiment that drives the futures contract to a discount&quot; and triggers a sell program.    While the effects of program trading continued to spook investors, market professionals said they detected some relaxing of fears that the November trade figures to be released tomorrow will show another record monthly deficit.    Fears that the deficit could be as large as $20 billion have depressed stock prices during the past few sessions, but indications are that investors are beginning to assume that stock prices already reflect &quot;worst-case&quot; possibilities. Indeed, many market strategists suggested that there could be a sharp rally tomorrow if the deficit comes in below $15 billion or even $16 billion.    Joseph Feshbach, a market strategist at Prudential Bache Securities, is assuming that the deficit mightn't be nearly as bad as some people think. He's relying on a recent comment by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that the record monthly deficit of $17.6 billion set in October was an aberration. &quot;Why would he say that if he wasn't pretty sure that the November number wouldn't be as bad?&quot; said Mr. Feshbach. &quot;He'd be setting himself up to look like a fool if he didn't know something.&quot;    &quot;There's a bit more confidence now,&quot; said Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. &quot;There are definitely some improving perceptions of the trade figures and expectations that the market has discounted everything but the most horrendous results.&quot;    Technology stocks turned in a mixed performance. International Business Machines was among the most actively traded issues yesterday. It gained 7/8 to 116 1/8. Motorola was up 1/8 to 45 7/8. But Digital Equipment lost 2 to 122 3/4; Texas Instruments was off 1/2 to 49 3/4; and Hewlett-Packard closed at 54 1/2, down 1/8.    Insurance issues got a boost after the U.S. subsidiary of B.A.T Industries PLC offered $60 a share for Farmers Group Inc., which rose 11 1/4 to 54 1/4 in over-the-counter trading. Chubb gained 2 1/8 to 56 3/4; American International rose 3/4 to 58 3/8; Continental Corp. was up 5/8 to 38 1/4, and General Re closed at 52 3/4, up 5/8.    Pharmaceutical stocks were mixed.

The company's chairman met with Donald Kelly, chairman of E-II Holdings Inc., apparently to discuss ways to boost American Brands stock price. E-II Holdings owns a 4.74% stake in American Brands. American Brands said no specific proposals were made and no further meetings are scheduled.    Pan Am dropped 1/4 to 2 7/8. It said it expects to report a 1987 loss much larger than had been expected. Further, the Teamsters Union is threatening to strike the airline.    Salomon Inc. rose 1 3/8 to 22 7/8 on rumors that investor Warren Buffet or CBS chief executive Laurence Tisch were interested in the company. Mr. Buffet denied that he wants to expand his holdings; a spokesman for Mr. Tisch said he hadn't any comment.    Telex climbed 1 1/8 to 57 5/8, apparently as a result of an effort by company officials to promote an offer by Memorex NV to acquire as much as 90% of Telex stock for $56 a share in cash and a $6 liquidation preference issue of Telex stock. Company presentations focused on promoting the preferred portion of the tender offer.    Primark closed at 20 1/2, up 1 3/4.
