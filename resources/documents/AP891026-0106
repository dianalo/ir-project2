Eleven environmental groups accused Bush of failing to live upto election promises to confront the so-called ``greenhouse''problem early in his presidency.   ``We have great rhetoric but no leadership,'' Dan Becker of theSierra Club, declared at a news conference.   He and the other environmentalists noted that during hiselection campaign, Bush promised to tackle early in his presidencythe concerns of expected rising world temperatures because ofman-made pollution.   ``In fact, the president has not even made clear who within thegovernment should be in charge of developing a national climatepolicy,'' said Brooks Yeager, vice president for government affairsat the Audubon Society.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We don'tbelieve progress has been slowed. The president has made whateverdecisions are necessary ... We feel that progress has been made.   ``These are difficult issues that have long-term ramificationsin terms of costs and regulatory intrusion and those issues have tobe considered,'' Fitzwater said.   The latest round of criticism was set off by reports of discordwithin the administration over whether William K. Reilly,administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, should attenda meeting in the Netherlands on the problem of global warming.   Reilly told reporters Wednesday he would head the U.S.delegation to the conference attended by environmental ministersfrom 68 nations, but that the United States wouldn't make anyspecific commitment to curb ``greenhouse'' pollutants, chieflycarbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.   Administration sources confirmed, however, that Reilly'sattendance at the conference Nov. 6-7 was uncertain until just afew days ago and that key White House advisers had suggested nodelegation be sent.   Christopher Flavin, an expert on global warming issues forWorldwatch Institute, said the flap was seen by many Europeanofficials as further indication that the United States isn'tprepared to lead the effort to deal with global warming.   ``This is a major meeting,'' Flavin said in an interview. ``It'sbeen in the planning stage for better part of a year. The UnitedStates just doesn't have its act together.''   The United States accounts for about one-fifth of the pollutantslinked to global warming.   The environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, AudubonSociety, Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earthand the Environmental Defense Fund, called on Bush to commit theUnited States to a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 20percent by the year 2000.   Carbon dioxide is the chief pollutant causing global warming.Sharp reductions _ or even stabilization _ would requiresignificant energy conservation including development of more fuelefficient automobiles and appliances as well as other conservationmeasures.   Reilly declined Wednesday to discuss reports of discord withinthe administration on the global warming issue.   ``The president has made it very clear. We recognize the globalwarming problem,'' he said.   But Reilly said it would be premature to present a detailedcommitment for the reduction of greenhouse pollutants until after``a whole range of questions'' are resolved, including the role ofdeveloping nations.   The Dutch government was expected to propose that nations, in2000, freeze carbon dioxide emissions at current levels.   Presidential advisers failed Friday to reach agreement on how torespond to the Dutch proposal, prompting some members attending theWhite House Domestic Policy Council meeting to suggest that Reillyskip the conference, sources said.   Reilly, the sources said, suggested at the meeting that theUnited States might be the host of a conference next year to beginnegotiating an international convention on global warming. Thatidea was met with strong opposition, the sources said.   Bush on several occasions has expressed concern about thegreenhouse effect, and during his presidential campaign promised toconvene an international conference during his first year in theWhite House.   While Reilly has advocated an aggressive response to globalwarming, other administration officials _ including the president'sscience adviser, D. Allan Bromley, and Chief of Staff John Sununu _have cautioned against moving too quickly.   They argue a clear scientific consensus on the impact of thegreenhouse effect on global temperatures hasn't emerged.   Furthermore, they maintain, the economic costs of dealing withthe problem _ primarily curbs on the use of fossil fuels _ may beso significant that no action is warranted until the actual dangeris better known.</TEXT></DOC>
