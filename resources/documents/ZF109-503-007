(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>SPOT, from Flagstaff Engineering, appears to have it all: clever features,good looks, and a respectable list price of $695.andP;  SPOT's only problem isthat good specs don't always guarantee good results.andM;SPOT is a trainable OCR package, and it comes with just seven font tables-asevere limitation.andP;  These font tables are restricted to a specific size oftype-you cannot use a 12-point Times Roman OCR font table to recognizeten-point Times Roman type.andP;  Instead, you'll probably end up training theprogram for the new fonts you intend to use.andM;Fortunately, training is fairly easy.andP;  SPOT has a great deal of functionalintelligence built-in, so it can access the table for the font most similarto the one being trained, and use this as a jumping off point for creating anew font table.andP;  Dedicated functions allow you to skip ahead to the nextunrecognized character, which can save lots of training time.andM;Time saved in this manner isn't always beneficial, though.andP;  It's easy to skipover letters that are misidentified by the program, and you'll miss theopportunity to correct the mistake.andP;  Also, the training process sometimesgets confused, so that the characters analyzed  in the image are out of syncwith the characters recognized by the program.andP;  The only solution is to aborttraining on that line, and start that line over again.andM;THOSE DEADLY LIGATURESandM;Another problem with SPOT is that it cannot separate letters that touch dueto insufficient scanning resolution.andP;  You can use the high-order characterpositions in a font to store ligature combinations, but the process istedious.andP;  Also, no more than three letters can be stored as a ligature, so incases where four or more letters run together, you cannot get the correctinformation stored as part of the trained font.andP;  Because of this limitation,SPOT was hardly able to deal with underlined text.andM;SPOTandM;Flagstaff Engineering, 1120 Kaibab Lane Flagstaff, AZ 86001; (602)779-3341,(800) 346-3627.andM;List Price: $695.andM;Requires: IBM XT, AT, PS/2, or compatible, 640K RAM (1.5MB expanded memoryrecommended), hard disk, DOS 3.0 or later.andP;  Mouse recommended.andM;In Short: This trainable program has a few good features, but its quirkyinterface, limited number of pretrained fonts, and overall poor performancemake it a relatively unattractive choice.andM;The program was able to handle our multicolumn sample automatically when theright margin was ragged, but it failed to work when the text columns werejustified.andP;  A company technical support representative verified that I Wasusing the program correctly and had all the options set appropriately, butthe results were still incorrect; the two columns were run together by SPOTas it converted the text.andP;  The program cannot handle landscape pages at all.andM;INTERFACE ODDITIESandM;The user interface makes good use of a mouse and pull-down menus.andP;  You canuse Alt-key combinations to access many of the program's functions, and thereis context-sensitive help.andP;  The interface ignores some widely acceptedconventions.andP;  For example, SPOT menus often show items as&quot;grayed-out&quot;-displayed in a shaded rather than a solid color.andP;  In almost anyother program, this would indicate that those options are not available.andP;  InSPOT, however, this merely means that the command is not selected; if youclick on these grayed-out options, they become solid and activated.andM;Many of these quirks and shortcomings might be overlooked, were it not forthe fact that in spite of careful training and repeated adjustments to itsmany options, the program was simply not very accurate.andP;  SPOT does contain abuilt-in text editor, and you have the option of going directly into thismode following a conversion so that you may view the results and make anychanges.andP;  Based on our results, you are going to have plenty of correctionsto make.andM;SPOT might be useful if considered in the absence of alternatives, but in theface of its competitors, many of which approach excellence in OCRperformance, SPOT must be relegated to the status of an also-ran.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
