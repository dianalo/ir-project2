In addition to finding that one in four do not know ChristopherColumbus made his famous landing in the Western Hemisphere prior tothe year 1500, the Gallup Poll suggests considerable ignorance ofother basic facts about history and literature.   Nearly 60 percent did not know the Korean War started when HarryS. Truman was president, 58 percent did not know that WilliamShakespeare wrote ``The Tempest'' and nearly a quarter believed afamous saying from Karl Marx is part of the U.S. Constitution.   ``If the students' answers were to be graded, more than half ofthose tested would have failed,'' concluded the survey, which wasconducted for the National Endowment for the Humanities.   Armed with the survey results, NEH Chairman Lynne Cheney calledSunday for colleges and universities to revise their curricula soundergraduates study ``essential areas of knowledge.''   In a booklet titled ``50 Hours,'' she outlined a suggested corecurriculum for college students.   Responding to her admonition, several college presidentsessentially told the NEH chief _ in more or less polite terms _either to mind her own business or that she was behind the times.   Here are some of the Gallup Poll highlights:   _24 percent of the college seniors surveyed thought Columbuslanded in the Western Hemisphere some time after 1500.   _42 percent could not place the Civil War in the correct halfcentury.   _58 percent did not know that Shakespeare was the author of``The Tempest,'' but 95 percent knew that Mark Twain wrote ``TheAdventures of Huckleberry Finn.''   _58 percent did not know Truman was president when the KoreanWar began. Fourteen percent thought it started when John F. Kennedywas president.   _55 percent could not identify the ``Magna Carta.''   _23 percent believed that Marx' phrase, ``From each according tohis ability, to each according to his need,'' is part of the U.S.Constitution.   According to the survey, 39 percent of the college seniorsfailed the 49-question history section. On the portion of thesurvey devoted to literature, which consisted of 38 questions, 68percent of the students failed.   Cheney said many colleges and universities allow students toearn bachelor's degrees without taking courses in history,literature, science or mathematics and urged trustees andadministrators to support faculty members who are working tostrengthen general education requirements.   Cheney's core curriculum suggests study in five basic areas ofknowledge.   The first area, 18 semester hours on cultures and civilizations,would start with a one-sememster survey course on the origins ofcivilization in general to be followed by two semesters of WesternCivilization and one of American Civilization and then two,one-semester courses to be chosen from among the following: AfricanCivilization, East Asian Civilization, Islamic Civilization, LatinAmerican Civilization and South Asian Civilization.   The other four areas of basic study: foreign language, 12 hours;concepts of mathematics, six hours; natural sciences, eight hours;social sciences, six hours.   The courses, Cheney said, should be taught in small classes andin an integrated fashion, so that, for example, students readingDescartes' philosophy in a Western Civilization course are remindedof his contributions to mathematics. She also suggested that theclasses be taught by the college's most distinguished faculty.   James Underwood, dean of faculty at Union College inSchenectady, N.Y., criticized the NEH for recommending a``superficial, rigid, and impractical'' college curriculum. Headded that Union College this fall began a general educationcurriculum with an emphasis on history and literature.   ``A reform that relies so heavily on the traditional westerncivilization course runs the risk of a dangerous superficiality,''said Underwood. ``The Western Civilization course tries to `doeverything' and demands for its success the mythical `Renaissanceman' as teacher. History should be taught by broadly educatedhistorians and literature by professors of literature.''   Norm Adler at the University of Pennsylvania said, ``It isencouraging to notice how much the report mirrors the curricularevisions that have taken place'' at his school.   Similar sentiments were echoed by Michigan State President JohnDiBieggio, who said the school already has gotten an revisedcurriculum approved by the community and board of trustees.   Elton Bruins of Hope College in Holland, Mich., said, ``Hopenever gave way to current fads of dropping core curriculum. We'vealways believed it is very important. For many years we wereprobably considered old-fashioned by a lot of schools.''   The Gallup survey included 33 questions taken from a 1986NEH-funded survey of 17-year-olds and five questions fromexaminations that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Serviceadministers to prospective American citizens.   Grading the 87-question survey on the standard ``A'' to ``F''scale, where scoring less than 60 percent correct constitutes afalling grade, 55 percent of the students would have earned an``F.'' An additional 20 percent would have received a ``D.'' Only11 percent of the respondents would have earned an ``A'' or ``B.''   The Gallup survey of 696 seniors was conducted between April 4and April 27, using a self-administered test booklet. It had a 4percent margin of error. The participating students attend 67four-year American colleges and universities, both public andprivate.</TEXT></DOC>
