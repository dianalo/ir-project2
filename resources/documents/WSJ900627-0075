Though the agreement at a summit of the 12 heads of the ECmember nations was short on specifics, it set the EC on theroad to another major foreign-policy exercise, atop analready ambitious program of aid to revision-minded EasternEuropean countries.</LP><TEXT>   The leaders declined to set any specific levels of aid tothe U.S.S.R., deciding to wait until two detailed studies onproblems in the Soviet economy are completed. The first studywill address short-term financial strains, such as thegrowing payments crisis. The second is to try to identifyways the West can help the Soviets move away from a centrallyplanned economy and develop a more efficient andmarket-oriented economic infrastructure.   The vagueness of the EC commitment was viewed as adisappointment for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl andFrench President Francois Mitterrand. People at the meetingsaid Mr. Kohl had suggested that at least $15 billion isneeded for any assistance to the Soviet Union to bemeaningful, though Mr. Kohl denied he had pushed for anyparticular level of aid. Moreover, West German officialspointed out that they hadn't expected a final decision on theaid program at this meeting. Mr. Kohl said he &quot;couldn't haveexpected anything more.&quot;   EC Commission President Jacques Delors, a leading advocateof an EC role in helping the Soviets, was clearly pleased.The leaders put the commission in charge of devisingproposals for the aid program, which is to be considered byEC ministers by autumn. The commission will consult not onlywith Western allies but with major international economicorganizations, such as the International Monetary Fund. Mr.Delors will visit Moscow next month on a previously plannedvisit.   In addition to the EC initiative toward the Soviet Union,the two-day summit set the dates for two treaty-amendingconferences aimed at strengthening the EC's powers overeconomic, monetary and political matters. The leaders took arange of foreign-policy positions, and, after some debate,decided to preserve sanctions against South Africa.   The decision regarding the Soviet Union comes as the Bushadministration agonizes about whether to join in the aideffort. The EC plans to describe its approach at the economicsummit of the seven industrial powers in Houston next month.But European leaders made it clear that the EC aid programwould proceed independently of any U.S. or Japanese support.   &quot;We are sending a clear signal to Houston,&quot; said IrishPrime Minister Charles Haughey, who was chairman of thesummit. &quot;Our statement expresses full support of the economicand political process of restructuring undertaken byPresident {Mikhail} Gorbachev.&quot;   The Dublin agreement is an illustration of how differentlyEuropeans and Americans view developments in the SovietUnion. In the U.S., aid to the Soviets has been stymiedpartly by objections to Moscow's handling of the Lithuanianindependence movement and to continued Soviet military aid toCuba and other Third World dictatorships.   But in Europe, these worries have been overridden by evendeeper concerns about the stability of a nuclear-armedsuperpower that appears to be on the verge of collapse.Moreover, European countries are trying to pave the way forGerman unification by bringing Soviet Union into a closereconomic relationship.   &quot;We're very ready to consider financial assistance,provided it is clearly linked to economic reform,&quot; BritishPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher said.   The leaders also instructed the EC Commission to study aplan put forward by Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers to setup an energy network providing for increased purchases ofSoviet oil and natural gas. This plan, Mr. Lubbers argued,would further the Europeans' overall goal of helping tointegrate the Soviet Union into the international economy.   Mrs. Thatcher, Mr. Delors and Mr. Lubbers all warned thatthe West could end up wasting its money if it poured cashinto the Soviet Union without insisting on deep-seatedeconomic changes. Mr. Delors reasoned that mere financial aidwon't help cure long-term structural maladies in the Sovieteconomic system, such as a poor distribution network and thelack of a banking system and a convertible currency.   Mr. Delors said, &quot;Gorbachev has been there five years, andso far, the reforms have not produced the results that wereexpected.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Unsure Political Conditions, DamagedEconomies Make Lenders Cautious&quot; -- WSJ June 27, 1990)</TEXT></DOC>
