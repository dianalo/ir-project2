By some estimates, there are over 100 funds in existence, morethan half of which were established in the past five years to cashin on the latest craze in takeovers.   Just a few years ago, big leveraged buyouts were a scarcecommodity. In 1981, 15 buyouts were announced worth at least $25million each for a total of $3.1 billion. By 1987, the figure jumpedto 114 such buyouts totaling $59.1 billion, according to RussellReynolds Associates Inc., a New York recruiting firm.   In the past year alone, among those to announce their intentionsto enter the fray by creating funds that invest in LBOs areManufacturers Hanover, Citibank, General Electric Credit Corp., andMerrill Lynch andamp; Co., which is specializing in a fund for smallinvestors, among others.   LBO funds attract investors ranging from well-heeled individualsto pension funds to university endowments often with the promise ofreturns as high as 50 percent. With such strong backing, LBO fundshave been able to amass $25 billion to $30 billion in assets, whichis enough to leverage 10 times that amount.   But the proliferation of these funds is putting pressure onmanagers to turn deals.   ``There's no question that when you buy an LBO fund, you arebuying because you want those funds to make (takeover) offers and bepart of offers,'' said Hugh Johnson, first vice president at FirstAlbany Corp.   ``The returns in many LBO funds have been substantial, so asresult it has driven a lot of expectations of returns for thosefunds in future,'' he added.   Despite the availability of money for financing, most LBO fundsfind it challenging to find good deals at appropriate prices, saidSteven B. Potter, a managing director at Russell Reynolds.   So much money chasing deals is bound to boost the price oftransactions and cut into profit margins. Ultimately there is thedanger that these funds may not be able to rake in the double-digitreturns they advertise.   Johnson said he believes investors have developed ``expectationswell beyond what is realistically possible.'' That means, as Johnsonnotes, that ``maybe not so far down the road, there are going to besome disappointments.''   In the case of RJR Nabisco Inc., three potential bidders haveemerged, including two major leveraged buyout firms. The RJR dealhas pretty much carved up Wall Street _ Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.and Salomon Bros. Inc. are working with RJR managers, while LBOpowerhouse Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. has its own entourage ofbackers for its $20.7 billion bid.   Rival buyout firm Forstmann Little andamp; Co. also is considering abid, which could push the price tag of the deal even higher.Analysts already are concerned that any higher offer could make thedeal financially unfeasible.   In a leveraged buyout, a portion of a company's assets are usedto finance the acquisition. The deal also relies on taking on asubstantial amount of debt, which typically forces managers to selloff assets and slash overhead to meet their obligations to banks andbondholders.   More troubling than RJR is the case of Campeau Corp.'s takeoverof Federated Department Stores Inc. After investors looked askanceat the $1.15 billion in junk bonds needed to finance the deal,Campeau scurried to restructure the package to make it moreattractive.   If Campeau or its financial backers lose money on the deal,Johnson said, financiers will probably take a harder look at LBOs.Large pension funds and other investors ``will withdraw from thosefunds, and then the acquisitions could dry up,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wednesday Nov. 9</NOTE></DOC>
