A higher purchase price can be justifiedif, as a result, the expected day to day running costs are reduced sufficiently.Adding automatic control and improved instrumentation may also be economicif this results in lower running costs. Modern control equipment is oftenadded on a 'retrofit' basis to an existing installation to reduce runningcosts for energy or for supervision. More opportunities for energy conservationwill be taken up if the cost benefits of reducing energy costs are betterunderstood. Methods are presented here for analysing the cost of energyconsumed by engineering plant and for assessing whether an investmentthat would produce energy savings is also cost effective.</TEXT></DOC>
