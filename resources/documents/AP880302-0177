Citizen on Jimmy Swaggart:   So one more television evangelist falls. Jimmy Swaggart is oneof the biggest, but the country has become accustomed to seeing TVministers stumble because of worldly pleasures.   The only remarkable thing about the Swaggart case is the extentto which everyone is focusing on his physical sin, that ofconsorting with a prostitute. In the eyes of his church and hisfollowers, that was his greatest offense, and they already havebegun forgiving him.   Give Swaggart credit _ he knew what he had to do. He prostratedhimself before the elders of the Assemblies of God denomination,his congregation, his TV audience and God himself. Swaggart blamedno one else.   He admitted sinning, took full responsibility and beggedforgiveness. Most of his sympathizers were not just touched, theywere overwhelmed.   Amid all this glorious healing, it seems almost unkind to notethat Swaggart did not admit his sin until he had no choice _ untilit was reported by a fellow TV evangelist and competitor whomSwaggart had helped discredit and drive out of business.   He did not confess until his worldly empire was at stake. Wherewere Swaggart's humility and repentance during all those months oryears before he was found out?</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 29   Palm Beach (Fla.) Post on the Supreme Court's parody decision:   The Supreme Court decision in the case of Falwell vs. Flynt is areassuring vote of confidence in the principle of freedom of speech.   In a decision significant for its unanimity, the justices saidthe Rev. Jerry Falwell may not collect $200,000 in damages frompublisher Larry Flynt and Hustler magazine for a parody. ...   There is no question the parody was putrid. It also was painfulfor Moral Majority founder Falwell.   Still, to condemn it because it breaks all boundaries for sleazeis one thing. To rule it is libelous is another.   If a public figure cannot prove he has been libeled, he can'trecover damages for even the most extreme embarrassment.   In this case, that would have meant proving the parody containedstatements known by the author to be false, which could beconsidered true. It's impossible to imagine that anyone consideredthe parody true.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 25   Honolulu Star-Bulletin on the Supreme Court parody decision:   The American democratic system requires that the fullestpossible leeway for comment, even comment that is unfair and in theworst taste.   That description applies to the Hustler spoof. Because it couldnot have been reasonably interpreted as stating facts about (Jerry)Falwell, his claim of libel failed. At that point the FirstAmendment took over.   Many of us committed to the First Amendment would feel morecomfortable rallying behind a worthier champion than Hustlermagazine. But great principles of justice can sprout from unseemlyroots.   The Supreme Court, by extending constitutional protection forparody and satire, has advanced the cause of freedom.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 25   The Sun, Westerly, R.I., on the long Supreme Court vacancy:   Two-thirds of a year have gone by from the time a Supreme Courtvacany occurred until Judge Anthony Kennedy was sworn in ... as theninth justice.   The question whether it was worth the wait will be variouslyanswered, depending on one's opinion of Kennedy and the priornominees who were rejected.   No one, however, can dispute the assertions that Kennedy was acompromise candidate after the administration had failed with JudgeRobert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg.   The Senate deemed Bork too controversial for his narrowconstitutional stance, Ginsburg not only flawed in character but ofinadequate judicial stature. ...   Kennedy, in contrast to his predecessors before the Senate inits process of advice and consent, was readily approved _ perhapsin part out of relief that a conservative yet not rigidlydoctrinaire nominee was at least offered; but in any case, approved.   Some liberals, especially women's rights advocates, still havetheir doubts about how Justice Kennedy will perform. On the whole,however, he appears to be an excellent choice. And it is good tohave a full court again after a long hiatus.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 28   The Oshkosh (Wis.) Northwestern on educational testing:   While it is edifying that Wisconsin leads the rest of the nationon American College Testing (ACT) scores, ... Wisconsin ranks nearthe bottom in the percentage of students taking that or theScholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).   That does not mean that the high score is somehow invalid. Butit does suggest that it may be artificially high in comparison toother states where the average is lower but the percentage ofstudents taking the test is higher.   As ratings experts have long counseled: Do not read too muchinto the test scores data. It can't be used to prove the quality ofa state's educational product.   It may point to some extra efforts if the average fluctuatesgreatly from one year to the next. But it is not universally takenand thus there are too many other factors involved in assessing thequality of education which those tests can not depict.</TEXT></DOC>
