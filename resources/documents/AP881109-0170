In a statement, Reagan said the questions ``would not producedata sufficiently useful to justify their inclusion'' and would``increase administrative costs and add to the paperwork burdenimposed on the public by the census.''   ``Adequate data on plumbing and heating will continue to beavailable through the census and other sources,'' the president said.   The bill also would have required tabulations relating toAsian-Americans and Pacific Islanders as part of the census.
