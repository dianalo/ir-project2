Police headquarters in Seoul reported that 43,000 students andothers joined in demonstrations or sit-ins at 106 places across thenation. The number included 39,000 students demonstrating at 103colleges, police said.   In Seoul, fierce clashes erupted after riot police hurling teargas grenades broke up a march in the streets near City Hall. Wavesof screaming students charged riot police near Myongdong Cathedral,blocking streets and hurling rocks, bricks and firebombs.   ``Down with the military dictatorship which committed theKwangju massacre!'' the protesters yelled. ``Drive out the Rohmurder regime!''   Clashes also broke out in the provincial cities of Sunchon,Pusan, Chungju and Chongju where students and police fought runningbattles in the streets after rallies marking the eighth anniversaryof the Kwangju uprising.   Police declined to release any figures on injuries or arrests.   In Kwangju, long lines of mourners, many wearing black ribbons,filed through Mangwoldong Cemetery as prayers were offered ataltars bearing pictures of people killed in the uprising.   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo, punish (former president) Chun Doo-hwan,''some protesters shouted during the services in the city 165 milessouthwest of Seoul.   About 10,000 people, mostly students, later marched from thecemetery to the plaza in front of the downtown provincialgovernment office.   No police were in sight along the route, but police inside theoffice fired tear gas, scattering the protesters.   When the protesters regrouped, some throwing empty cans at thepolice, one officer used a loudspeaker to apologize for what hecalled a mistaken firing of tear gas.   The rally then proceeded peacefully, swelling at one point to anestimated 50,000 people, with another 20,000 to 30,000 spectators.   Protesters called for daily demonstrations for the rest of theweek.   The Korean news agency Yonhap reported that a student angeredbecause a campus festival was going ahead on the Kwangjuanniversary set himself on fire in Chonan, about 30 miles south ofSeoul. It said he suffered serious burns.   Police were on nationwide alert, with about 50,000 riot policedeployed in Seoul and other cities and security around governmentoffices was stepped up.   The leaders of the three main opposition parties agreed today topush for formation of a legislative committee to investigate theKwangju uprising. The meeting among Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam andKim Jong-pil was their first since the combined opposition defeatedRoh's party in National Assembly elections on April 26.   At the cemetery, relatives of the dead wept at the gravesidesand put up placards denouncing the Roh government and calling forretribution. Mourning prayers were chanted and incense burned onthe altars.   ``We must overcome our anguish and sorrow to drive out themilitary dictatorship,'' said Chun Ky-ryang, a leader of therelatives' of those killed in the uprising.   Roh and Chun were top generals who had just seized power in 1980when students and citizens took control of Kwangju during protestsin the traditional anti-government stronghold.   The government says 191 people were killed when troops ended theuprising, but dissidents claim hundreds died.   Roh, who took office in February after winning election inDecember, has attempted to defuse lingering resentment over Kwangjuby honoring those killed and offering compensation to victims.</TEXT></DOC>
