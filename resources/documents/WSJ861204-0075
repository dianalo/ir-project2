Xerox, an office-equipment and financial services concern, will make and sell several electronic typewriters designed by the Japanese company. In turn, Brother, which makes office equipment and various consumer products, will receive rights to sell daisy-wheel printers designed and made by Xerox. Xerox said the final agreement will be signed in the second quarter of 1987 and will last through 1988. The companies didn't disclose financial details or projected sales.    The agreement is a further example of the trend toward technology exchanges between U.S. and Japanese companies, spurred in part by the rise in the value of the yen, pressure on Japanese corporate profits and fears over U.S. protectionism. Such factors have led a number of Japanese concerns to seek U.S. production capabilities, most recently in semiconductors.    The agreement should buttress Xerox's line of electronic typewriters. Xerox, Stamford, Conn., has about 20% of the total U.S. market but has done better at the high end of the market than in the small-business and home markets where the Brother typewriters are aimed. Xerox, which has never done high-volume manufacturing for another company, also should benefit because it will be able to use more of the capacity at its highly automated factory in Fremont, Calif.    Brother, based in Nagoya, Japan, said the Xerox daisy-wheel printer will give it a faster, more powerful product than it now has in that line. Brother, whose U.S. sales rose 18% last year to $245 million, said it will gain its first manufacturing capability in the U.S. with the agreement. Both companies said the accord probably will lead to further cooperation. </TEXT></DOC>
