As thewalkout by 9,300 Greyhound drivers, mechanics and clerksentered its fifth week, the company refused to return to thebargaining table until a week passes without violence.</LP><TEXT>   The suit was filed under the federal Racketeer Influencedand Corrupt Organizations law, which is being employed moreand more by companies with labor troubles.   In a statement, union President James La Sala againdecried the violence surrounding the strike, referring to theperpetrators as &quot;common criminals.&quot; But Mr. La Sala alsocondemned the company's charges against his union as&quot;outrageous&quot; and said management was using the violence as &quot;asmokescreen to avoid its legal and moral responsibility tonegotiate in good faith.&quot;   Greyhound filed its RICO suit in federal court inJacksonville, Fla., which was the site of a March 11 snipingincident that injured seven Greyhound passengers. Since thestrike began March 2, more than 30 Greyhound buses andterminals have been hit by gunfire, and the company hasreceived 80 bomb threats.   The company previously obtained individual court ordersagainst union violence in 20 cities. But in an interview, P.Anthony Lannie, Greyhound executive vice president and chieflabor negotiator, said that strategy has failed to stem theviolence. &quot;Perhaps they will stop it if the court is imposingliability on them for doing so,&quot; said Mr. Lannie, adding thatthe company hopes to obtain a nationwide injunction throughthe RICO suit.   The court filing lists more than 100 incidents of allegedviolence, harassment and intimidation nationwide and containsspecific allegations of incidents in Florida and Alabamainvolving alleged death threats and assaults aimed atreplacement drivers, intimidation of passengers anddestruction of company property. The suit also alleges that acartoon appeared on certain union bulletin boards depicting areplacement driver being shot by man with a rifle.   Despite numerous statements by union officials condemningthe violence, the lawsuit also alleges that union leadershaven't acted to halt the attacks and that people engaged insuch activity have continued to receive union strike pay.   Named as defendants in the suit were Amalgamated Transit;its bargaining unit, Amalgamated Council of Greyhound LocalUnions; and locals in Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C. SeveralAmalgamated Council officials were also named, includingPresident Edward M. Strait and the presidents of the twolocals.   The suit claims the defendants' actions have cost the unitof GLI Holding Co. at least $10 million and seeks trebledamages, court and attorney fees and unspecified punitivedamages under Florida law. In addition, Greyhound asked thecourt to appoint receivers to take over the two locals,described by Mr. Lannie as &quot;the two most closely linked tothe violence.&quot;   Meanwhile, at least one union offical named in the suithinted that he might file a countersuit against Fred Currey,Greyhound chairman and chief executive. &quot;I hope he can proveall that,&quot; said Rafael Rivera, president of the Atlantalocal. &quot;He's been going around the country calling unionofficials `terrorists.' As far as I'm concerned, he's damagedmy reputation, and he's going to have to answer for thatsomewhere down the road.&quot;   Mr. Rivera also said an increasing number of drivers andunion officials would rather drive the current Greyhoundownership, led by Mr. Currey, into bankruptcy and hope fornew ownership or perhaps an employee buy-out. &quot;Even if thereis a contract, I don't think we could live with him anymore,&quot;said Mr. Rivera. &quot;The only way this bus line can survive isfor Currey to be gone.&quot;   Greyhound officials said the company isn't for sale.   ---   Katherine Walsh in Washington contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
