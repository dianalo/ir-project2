It wasfound that hydrogen gas at 1 bar had an insignificant effect on the courseof the reaction, as determined by free radical population measurements,compared with nitrogen gas. In contrast, both tetralin and decane changethe free radical populations developed during pyrolysis, and the extentof the induced change varies upon chloroform extraction of the coal.These results are discussed with reference to current coal liquefactionmodels, and are interpreted in terms of the chemical and physical interactionsof the solvent with the coal. 21 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
