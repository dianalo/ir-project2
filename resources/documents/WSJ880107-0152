Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> DAVENPORT, Iowa  </DATELINE><TEXT>   According to the size-of-motorcade count, Vice President George Bush leads Sen. Robert Dole here in Iowa, 14 to 6.    It is a rule of thumb in political campaigns that the longer a candidate's motorcade, the longer his lead over his rivals. But like all rules of thumb, this one is meant to be broken. And, in fact, the AIM rule (for Average Iowa Motorcade) already is suspect: Mr. Bush and Sen. Dole are running bumper to bumper in Iowa, which holds its celebrated, early-bird caucuses on Feb. 8.    Still, the rival motorcades do serve one useful function: They suggest the kinds of campaigns these two Republican front-runners are waging.    The vice president tours Iowa like a Roman proconsul, his 14-car motorcade snaking magisterially across the bleak Iowa countryside. An ambulance trails the candidate's limousine. Police cars form the vanguard and rear guard; other police cars block off all the crossroads to make sure an errant John Deere doesn't break the line. A helicopter hovers overhead.    The travel mode of Mr. Dole, the Senate minority leader, is more plebeian. The other day, the press van became separated from its five companion vehicles as the motorcade pulled away from the Blackhawk Hotel here in Davenport to start a long campaign day. A Coca-Cola truck crashed the line.    The vice president is running as President Reagan's logical successor. Mr. Dole is running as the commoner who would be king.    Class -- that is, social rank -- rears its surprising, and largely unfamiliar, head in this contest between the vice president from Greenwich, Conn., and the senator from Russell, Kan.    &quot;Nobody handed me anything,&quot; Mr. Dole says. &quot;I had no rich and powerful parents. I believe in small-town traditional values. I attended public schools. I know exactly where I'm from, who my friends are, where my roots are. Voters can look at me and say, 'He's one of us.'&quot;    That's the Dole slogan in Iowa, repeated again and again in speeches, displayed over and over in signs and banners: &quot;Bob Dole is one of us.&quot;    The point, muted as it may be, is obvious enough: George Bush is not one of us. Mr. Bush comes from a prosperous New York suburb (Greenwich) but, confusing to many, says he's a Texan. His father was a U.S. senator from Connecticut. Sen. Dole's father ran the local cream-and-egg station and his grandparents, tenant farmers, were on welfare. The vice president went to private schools (Greenwich Country Day, Andover) and an Ivy League college (Yale). Mr. Dole is from Russell High and Washburn University, the first member of his family to finish college.    It was Mr. Bush who dismissed a strawvote setback in Iowa by suggesting his supporters probably were playing golf or attending debutante parties.    Does Mr. Dole dislike preppies? a reporter once asked Robert Ellsworth, the senator's close friend and adviser. &quot;Do you like them?&quot; he replied. &quot;Does anybody?&quot;    In fact, relations between the two Republican candidates are becoming downright grumpy as the time for folks to vote draws near. On Tuesday, in a speech at the National Press Club, Mr. Bush said he wasn't impressed by Mr. Dole's record. &quot;I'm not sure being in Congress all your life is a part of the answer,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it may be a part of the problem.&quot; He urged reporters to tell Mr. Dole &quot;to get off my back.&quot; Mr. Dole replied, &quot;I have a solid record of leadership and he doesn't. And it must be getting to him.&quot;    The two men really don't like each other a lot.    Mr. Dole emphasizes again and again that he made it in life on his own, taking his lumps along the way. He suggests he works harder than the vice president. It's because of his small-town, work-ethic background, he argues. The job of vice president, he says, &quot;is inside work with no heavy lifting.&quot;    His biggest line these days goes this way: &quot;When Ronald Reagan wants his program passed -- when he wants action on his legislation -- he doesn't call George, he calls Bob.&quot;    He says Mr. Bush may talk all he wants about his support for the treaty Mr. Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed recently to remove short- and medium-range missiles from Europe. &quot;But I'm the only Republican candidate who's going to vote for that treaty in the Senate.&quot;    Mr. Bush campaigns as a man in logical line to the White House. &quot;I want to be president,&quot; he says. &quot;I've been a good vice president. I've been loyal to the president. Hey&quot; -- Mr. Bush introduces many of his sentences with, &quot;Hey&quot; -- &quot;in my family, loyalty is a strength. It's not a character flaw.&quot;    He talks frequently about his trips abroad, many of them to attend funerals -- 76 countries, altogether. He says his friend, Treasury Secretary James Baker, says of him: &quot;You die, he'll fly.&quot;    Both candidates, in fact, stress who they are and what they've accomplished. Neither tries to be profound or visionary. These are professional politicians, largely pragmatic in their beliefs, who are campaigning as conservative men of experience and organizational competence. Mr. Dole wins over his audiences with self-deprecatory humor and funny stories. The vice president wins his over by being earnest and telling inside stories about his talks with world leaders.    The contest, then, isn't ideological. It's character, personality, experience. It's cultural as much as anything else.    That being so, Mr. Bush is talking about himself too -- his family, his faith, his war record. He is trying to relate his experiences with everyone else's, and it isn't easy.    Mr. Dole was severely wounded at the end of World War II on Hill 913 in northern Italy. The vice president, piloting a torpedo bomber, was shot down by the Japanese, two months after his 20th birthday.    &quot;Was I scared floating around in a little yellow raft off the coast of an enemy-held island, setting a world record for paddling? Of course I was,&quot; says the vice president. &quot;What sustains you in times like that? Well, you go back to fundamental values. I thought about mother and dad and the strength I got from them -- and God and faith and the separation of church and state. You've got to be lifted up by something.&quot;    He talks too about being married for 42 years, and his five children, all of whom, he says, &quot;came home every night&quot; while they were growing up. (Mr. Dole remarried after divorcing his first wife, the mother of his only child.)    &quot;I don't like talking about my war record and all that personal stuff,&quot; says Mr. Bush. &quot;It's like being stretched out on a psychiatrist's couch. It's exhausting.&quot;    But, being vice president, there are compensations. Air Force Two, for example. People actually flock to airports to see it. The other day, a bird cracked a cockpit window. Another Air Force Two, an exact duplicate, appeared at the airport within an hour to take its place. No one could say what happened to the first plane.
