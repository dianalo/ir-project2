Analysts said Wednesday Coca-Cola was likely to use it for softdrink operations and to buy back its own stock.   Coca-Cola owns 53.8 million shares or 49 percent of Columbia'sstock. The soft-drink maker signed an option agreement to sell itsstake to Sony for $27 a share, subject to ratification by theCoca-Cola board which is to meet Monday.   Coca-Cola spokesman Randy Donaldson declined to say what Cokewill do with the cash.   But some analysts suggested the money would be used toaccelerate Coke's stock buy-back program or invest the cash in itsoverseas bottling operations.   ``I don't think they're going to get into any other business ina material way,'' said George E. Thompson, a soft-drink industryanalyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.   John Maxwell Jr., who follows Coca-Cola for Wheat FirstSecurities in Richmond, Va., said he expects Coke will complete thefinal portion of an ongoing 40 million share buyback program andpossibly start another one.   He said Coca-Cola will probably also invest in its soft drinkbusiness overseas.   Coca-Cola got into the movie business in 1982 when it bought apredecessor of Columbia Pictures. Coca-Cola subsequently launched anew studio called Tri-Star Pictures in a joint venture with CBSInc. and Home Box Office Inc.   In late 1987, Coca-Cola merged its entertainment business withTri-Star and wound up with 80 percent of the company that wascalled Columbia Pictures Entertainmment. It then distributed partof its interest in Columbia to Coca-Cola shareholders and retained49 percent in Columbia.   But Thompson said Coca-Cola was disappointed by its return onmotion pictures even though the television business was promising.   In the current movie season, 28 movies from Columbia and itssister company Tri-Star have accounted for only 14 percent of alladmissions sold.   ``Before the ink was even dry on the (1982 Columbia)acquisition, they realized they were in a business much morevolatile than they were used to,'' Thompson said.</TEXT></DOC>
