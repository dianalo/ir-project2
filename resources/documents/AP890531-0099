The state has cut its annual dropout figure from 5,000 to 3,400by threatening dropouts with loss of the most valuable commodity intheir young lives: their driver's license.   Under a law enacted last year, a student who drops out at 16loses his license and doesn't become eligible to get it again until18. Students with special situations have the right to appeal thedecision, but the state has not granted many exemptions. ...   Of course, its approach to cutting the dropout rate would notwork in every community or with every student. Many low-income andurban students don't drive, so threatening them with loss of theirlicense wouldn't mean much. ...   But for many teen-agers, the thought of losing their driver'slicense just might be enough to convince them to hang in thereanother year or two and finish high school. With an estimated oneout of four students failing to graduate in the United States,here's a new idea with a real impact.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 26   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on overweight Americans:   Americans are changing the way they manage their own bodies, butthey are still getting fatter every year.   At a time when the public has more information than ever beforeabout health and fitness, about what foods are healthful ..., theincrease in the percentage of overweight Americans is alarming anddisappointing.   Polster Louis Harris pointed out that two-thirds of Americansweigh more than their height and body type justify. And two-thirds... said they don't exercise strenuously.   Junk food continues its popularity; and exercise, while gainingin visibility, has not worked its way into the daily routines ofenough Americans.   It's time for a federal initiative, similar to PresidentKennedy's President's Council on Physical Fitness, something toinspire all of us to keep fit and stay healthy.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 23   Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va., on the safety of olderplanes:   Three cheers for the Federal Aviation Administration, which hastaken an important step toward making flying safer.   Until now, FAA policy has been to regularly inspect airliners,looking for signs of cracks, corrosion or metal fatigue. Whenproblems were found, parts were ordered replaced.   Last year's Aloha Airlines accident tragically illustrated theinadequacy of that policy. The aircraft involved, an older Boeing737, passed its inspection. But later, in flight over the Pacific,the top third of the aircraft peeled away. A flight attendant diedwhen she was sucked out of the plane and 61 of the 94 other peopleon board were injured before the pilots safely landed the aircrafton the island of Maui.   Since the Aloha incident, the FAA has re-examined its safetypolicies for older aircraft and it's now decided to order manyparts replaced at a certain age, regardless of their condition. ...   The FAA says the new policy will cost the airlines more than$140 million over the next few years. But that will be a cheapprice to pay if it makes the skylanes safer.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 30   The Philadelphia Inquirer on Rep. Newt Gingrich:   If you wondered what happened to Evel Knievel, he's alive andwell _ temporarily, at least _ and operating under the name of NewtGingrich.   Knievel, of course, was the accident-prone daredevil who thoughthe could defy gravity over the Grand Canyon on a motorcycle.   Rep. Gingrich, fast-talking, impulsive Republican from Georgia,has the equally madcap idea he can fly over the congressionalethics carnage without a scratch.   I'd say odds are 2 to 1 Gingrich winds up in the politicalversion of an emergency ward.   Gingrich's crash landing would be applauded by at least 200House Democrats. Expect no get-well cards. ...   Democrats can't forget that Gingrich relentlessly pursued (HouseSpeaker Jim) Wright, kicking him for a ``Mussolini-like ego'' whileWright was down. So, they're combing Gingrich's past, photostatingcopies of a 1984 Mother Jones magazine piece on his messy divorce.   And the nastiness won't stop with Neutron Newt.   These guys make the Hatfields and McCoys look like a class act.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 24   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on James Baker's Middle Eastspeech:   Secretary of State James A. Baker III ... had a remarkablyno-nonsense warning (for Israel): Give up the dream of annexing theoccupied West Bank and Gaza strip, and ``reach out to Palestiniansas neighbors who deserve political rights.''   For Palestinians and the Arab world, Baker had a plea to letIsrael live in peace and security, and to respond constructively toIsraeli proposals for elections in the occupied territories.   To some friends of Israel, this good-neighbor policy soundsnaive and dangerous.   Yet Israel cannot afford a conflict with Palestinians in theoccupied territories that lasts forever. ...   The struggle is dividing Israel, diverting resource from otherproblems, and souring world opinion.   Criticism of Israel, and the kind of balance Baker showed in hisspeech, do not mean any lessening of America's commitment to Israel.   What it does mean is a change from the style of the Reaganyears, when a speech as bluntly critical as Baker's would have beenout of the question.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
