But now many of these buyers are finding that the discounted mortgages don't help as much as they used to.    Citing new guidelines from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, many lenders now say that buyers must qualify for ARMs at their maximum second-year rates, if those buyers put down less than 20% of a home's purchase price. Borrowers applying for a one-year ARM with an initial rate of 8.5%, for example, will probably have to qualify for the mortgage at a rate of 10.5%, since most ARMs carry a 2% annual increase ceiling.    Freddie Mac came up with the new guidelines to help protect marginally qualified buyers from the kind of hefty second-year payment increases that could lead to foreclosure.    And while not law, the guidelines are likely to be followed by about 3,500 of the nation's banks, thrifts and mortgage institutions. That's because these lenders sell their loans to Freddie Mac -- and Freddie Mac won't buy what doesn't meet its standards.    No one knows how many people are being eliminated from the housing market because of Freddie Mac's move, but home builders report that some buyers are indeed feeling the squeeze. In Newburg, Ind., builder Phillip Nuffer says he's lost at least two customers due to the guidelines. And in Kansas City, Kan., Roger Davenport, president of Davenport Construction Co., says he has lost as many as four. Over time, adds Mr. Davenport, the new guidelines &quot;obviously are going to slow down sales.&quot; -   House the Poor,   Get a Tax Break   OWNERS OF apartment buildings may soon be able to deduct as charitable contributions the market rental value of units set aside for use by low-income and homeless families.    Legislation for the move is now making the rounds in Congress. It was drafted after lawmakers learned that members of an apartment association in Lexington, Ky., had given over apartments to the needy, in some cases free of charge, in others at only nominal rents. The number of apartments wasn't great, 15 out of 20,000. Still, the legislators wanted to reward owners for their generosity -- and to spur others to act similarly.    Whether or not the legislation would have that effect remains to be seen. But, according to the National Apartment Association, an industry trade group, it seems doubtful. The reason: Most landlords won't want to risk upsetting their regular tenants by bringing in residents from different social and economic classes -- and the tax breaks, while helpful, won't be powerful enough to overcome that disincentive.    Indeed, what owners fear most is what happened with a house-the-poor program started by the Houston Apartment Association in Texas three years ago: Tenants began moving out as low-income residents moved in. The problem became so great that earlier this year the association killed its program. Says a spokesman: &quot;On paper it looked good, but it just didn't work for us.&quot;    Proposed Plan in Chicago   Raises Racial Concerns   CONCERN OVER property values has triggered a racially charged debate in Chicago.    In an effort to protect home values, Illinois legislators recently proposed letting Chicago homeowners create special tax districts for themselves. Under the proposed legislation, oversight committees would be set up to determine the values of properties in these districts; they would then use the tax proceeds to buy homes from those who wanted to sell but could no longer get the previously determined prices.    Local civil-rights organizations find the proposal disturbing primarily because the neighborhoods calling for the legislation are predominantly white and are surrounded by expanding black enclaves. Chicago's black leaders say the scheme would give unfounded credence to the notion that when blacks move into a neighborhood, property values decline.    The controversy persuaded Chicago's acting mayor, Edwin Sawyer, to veto one version of the proposal earlier this year. But another has passed through Illinois's house and senate, and Gov. James R. Thompson is expected to make it law later this year.    Prices for Condominiums   Are on the Rebound -   CONDOMINIUM prices declined in the early 1980s because of overbuilding: too many condos, not enough buyers. Now the glut is drying up -- and prices are on the rise.    In the Northeast, South and West, prices for condos have increased on average about 18% over the five quarters through March 31, according to the National Association of Realtors.    The reason for the reversal: In many markets, the rising costs of single-family homes have sent buyers searching for less expensive alternatives, and condos have been the answer. As a result, their prices have jumped.    During the first quarter of 1988, this was especially true in the South, where median prices soared 10.5%, to $65,300 from $59,100. In the West, prices rose 5.8%, to $105,100 from $99,300. And in the Northeast, where more than half of all condos are now sold, prices rose 2%, to $111,100 from $108,900.    The only region where prices are continuing to decline is the Midwest, where they dipped to $57,600 from $58,700. That's because the region still has a healthy supply of affordable single-family homes. </TEXT></DOC>
