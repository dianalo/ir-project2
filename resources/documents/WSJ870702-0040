Mr. Sofer's decision to cooperate with the government indicates that he may be close to a plea-bargain agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.    In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint in federal court here charging that Nahum Vaskevitch, a managing director in charge of mergers and acquisitions at Merrill Lynch's London office, leaked confidential information about numerous transactions involving Merrill Lynch clients to Mr. Sofer.    The SEC charged that Mr. Sofer, a Jerusalem-based businessman, traded in securities affected by the planned transactions and spurred others to trade in those securities, although he and Mr. Vaskevitch were the only two individuals named in the SEC complaint. The SEC alleged that the insider-trading scheme generated more than $4 million in unlawful profit.    A federal grand jury in New York currently is conducting a related criminal investigation, according to the people familiar with the government investigation.    Mr. Sofer's attorney, Stanley S. Arkin, said, &quot;He's doing what he's doing and saying what he's saying,&quot; and refused any other comment. Mr. Sofer left Israel after the SEC charges were filed and couldn't be reached.    Thomas C. Newkirk, chief litigating counsel for the SEC in the case, declined to comment, as did John Carroll, an assistant U.S. attorney.    Gerald Harris, an attorney in New York for Mr. Vaskevitch, declined to comment.    By cooperating with the government, Mr. Sofer may be able to provide valuable information concerning Mr. Vaskevitch and others believed to be involved in the alleged insider-trading scheme, securities lawyers said.    In its March complaint, the SEC also alleged that Michael Jesselson -- the son of Ludwig Jesselson, founder of Phillips Brothers, now a unit of Salomon Inc. -- and Louis Barnett, a Fort Worth, Texas, investor, maintained accounts in which Mr. Sofer shared profits. The SEC alleged as well that Mr. Sofer made phone calls to Mr. Vaskevitch from the offices or homes of Messrs. Jesselson and Barnett.    The complaint also alleged that Michael J. Floersheim, a Zug, Switzerland, commodities trader, was a &quot;longtime associate&quot; of Mr. Sofer who, according to Mr. Sofer, had a &quot;financial interest&quot; in one of two companies charged by the SEC in the alleged insider-trading scheme.    None of the men were named as defendants.    Theodore Levine, an attorney for Mr. Jesselson, said that his client &quot;has cooperated with the government and hasn't been charged.&quot; He declined to comment further.    Gary Naftalis, Mr. Barnett's lawyer, said, &quot;He's never been charged with any wrongdoing, and I don't have any reason to believe he ever will be.&quot;    Mr. Floersheim, who has previously denied any wrongdoing, couldn't be reached yesterday.    Mr. Sofer is known as one of Israel's shrewdest and most successful speculators. He made his fortune during the 1970s by discovering oil in the Sinai, then Israeli-occupied, and made further profit by using his oil earnings to speculate in the Israeli stock market. His real estate investments include the Jerusalem Hilton, one of Israel's largest hotels.    Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch was ordered by a federal judge to turn over to the court about $460,000 in bonds and cash belonging to Mr. Vaskevitch, people familiar with the litigation said. The court order was obtained by the SEC from U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in New York.    The people said that Merrill Lynch had expressed concern about a possible jurisdictional dispute between U.S. and overseas courts. They said that following the U.S. court action, Mr. Vaskevitch obtained an order from an English court blocking Merrill from turning over the assets, the people said.    A Merrill spokesman declined to comment.    The assets include about $80,000 in cash held in a U.S. account and about $379,000 in Eurobonds held in European accounts in the name of a Merrill Lynch subsidiary, the people familiar with the litigation said. </TEXT></DOC>
