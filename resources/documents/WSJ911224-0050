Mr. Mozer is the central figure in Salomon'sTreasury-auction bidding scandal. Formerly chief governmentbond trader at the Salomon Inc. unit, Mr. Mozer was fired bythe big securities firm last August; Salomon has blamed himfor the wrongdoing the firm has admitted.</LP><TEXT>   The government hasn't charged Mr. Mozer with anywrongdoing, although prosecutors are continuing to interviewdozens of his former colleagues and clients in an attempt tobuild a case against him.   If Mr. Mozer were to reach a plea bargain agreement, hewould be expected to cooperate with the governmentinvestigators, giving them any information he could supply onimproper activities by Salomon executives or clients.   Mr. Arkin, a partner at the New York law firm ofChadbourne andamp; Parke, confirmed yesterday that he had beenretained by Mr. Mozer. He said that he will represent theformer Salomon trader in conjunction with Lee Richards, theNew York lawyer who has represented Mr. Mozer since lastsummer. Mr. Arkin declined to comment on any aspect of Mr.Mozer's defense strategy.   According to individuals familiar with Mr. Mozer'sdefense, Mr. Mozer sought Mr. Arkin's legal advice severalweeks ago, apparently because Mr. Mozer wished to go to trialand fight whatever charges might be brought against him. Butthe individuals said Mr. Arkin and Mr. Richards both believeMr. Mozer would be better off pleading to lesser charges in anegotiated plea bargain with the government, rather thanfacing a possible indictment. Mr. Richards couldn't bereached for comment.   The individuals stress that neither Mr. Arkin nor Mr.Richards has begun fullfledged plea negotiations on Mr.Mozer's behalf with the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office. Andthere isn't any certainty that a plea bargain can or will bestruck.   But Mr. Richards did offer prosecutors a so-called profferearlier this year in which he told them of what Mr. Mozermight offer the government in the way of information thatcould help in a continuing investigation, the individualssaid. Such a verbal offer is not binding and can't be usedagainst Mr. Mozer should he decide to fight his case attrial.   In most cases, legal experts say, potential defendants whoplead guilty before they are indicted face lesser charges andpenalties than they might if they pleaded guilty later on orwent to trial. The theory behind this treatment is that bypleading guilty, the defendant is sparing the government theinherent risk and expense of going to trial, as well ascooperating with the government in continuing investigations.   Salomon has admitted that it repeatedly submittedunauthorized bids in the name of clients at Treasury auctionsand violated rules that limit the amount of securities a firmcan buy at a single auction. Salomon has said publicly thatMr. Mozer lied to the government by submitting unauthorizedTreasury auction bids on about eight different occasions.   Mr. Mozer is in a particularly difficult situation becauseSalomon is cooperating extensively with the government in itscriminal and civil investigations, as are many Salomonemployees. Some legal experts have estimated that Mr. Mozerfaces more than 10 years in prison under federal sentencingguidelines if he is convicted of everything Salomon hasclaimed he did wrong.   Mr. Arkin has cut some successful plea bargains on behalfof clients. In July, he negotiated a plea bargain for AlanFiers, former chief of the Central Intelligence Agency'sCentral America task force. Mr. Fiers pleaded guilty to twomisdemeanor charges of withholding information from Congressduring the Iran-Contra hearings and won't have to face anyjail time.   In 1989, Mr. Arkin negotiated a plea bargain on behalf offormer stock speculator Salim B. Lewis. Mr. Lewis wassentenced to three years probation and fined $250,000 formanipulating the stock price of Fireman's Fund Corp. in 1986.   Mr. Arkin also represented Richard Wigton, the Kidder,Peabody andamp; Co. executive who faced insider-trading chargesthat later were dropped by federal prosecutors, and D. RonaldYagoda, the head trader at Marcus Schloss andamp; Co. who wasacquitted of insider trading after a federal court trial.   Meanwhile, federal prosecutors are turning up the heat onMr. Mozer. According to individuals involved in the case, theU.S. Attorney's office is preparing to seek a declaratoryjudgment from a Manhattan federal court judge soon that wouldallow attorneys for Salomon to testify against Mr. Mozer.   The individuals say that Mr. Richards, Mr. Mozer's otherlawyer, has argued that the Salomon's law firm, Wachtell,Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, and former Salomon chief counsel DonaldFeuerstein should be barred from repeating to the governmentanything Mr. Mozer may have told them during the course of aninternal investigation by Salomon.   The individuals say Mr. Mozer has asserted that he isprotected by &quot;attorney-client privilege&quot; because byrepresenting Salomon, Wachtell and Mr. Feuerstein were alsorepresenting Mr. Mozer while he was still an employee. Lastsummer, Mr. Mozer was interviewed by attorneys for Wachtell,who were investigating possible wrongdoing at Salomon. Thatinvestigation uncovered the Treasury bidding violations andled to Mr. Mozer's dismissal.</TEXT></DOC>
