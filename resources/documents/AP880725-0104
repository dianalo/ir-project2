At the conclusion of a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoringyoung men selected by the American Legion to study politics andgovernment, Reagan was asked ``are you ready to talk to Iran aboutthe hostages? Is it time.''   ``If they're willing and ready to talk, it's time,'' he said.   An administration official said earlier today that despite a newU.S. message last week, Iran still has not sent an ``authorized''reply to American entreaties about talks on normalizing relationsafter an eight-year lapse.   The message reiterated U.S. desires to discuss ties with Tehranand did not lay down conditions for a resumption of relations,broken in April 1980, said the official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   He said the United States would like to talk to the Iraniansabout ending the Persian Gulf war, the nine Americans held hostagein Lebanon and terrorism.   He said, however, that the United States had not imposedconditions for talks.   In any event, the official said, Tehran had not proposed an``authorized representative'' to respond to the U.S. overtures.   On Sunday, two senior U.S. officials said the administrationdeserves much of the credit for Iran's acceptance of a cease-firein its long war with Iraq.   ``This is a time, if not for bragging, at least it's been a timefor all of us to be proud that our policy has been a success,''John Whitehead, deputy secretary of state, said.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci agreed and said a cease-firemeans the year-old policy of escorting reflagged Kuwaiti tankersthrough the Persian Gulf will end ``as soon as we judge it safe(and) prudent to do so.''   But Carlucci, appearing on the NBC-TV program, ``Meet thePress,'' refused to set a date for the reduction of Navy ships inthe waterway. There are 27 U.S. warships there, compared with thefive or six that patrolled the gulf before the convoys began.   Carlucci also said improved U.S.-Iranian relations could lead tothe release of the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon byIranian-backed groups.   Iran has accepted United Nations resolution 598, which calls fora cease-fire in the eight-year war while the two sides try tonegotiate a lasting peace. Even as representatives of bothcountries prepare to meet with U.N. officials, Iraq has launched anew series of attacks against Iran.   Whitehead, appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week with DavidBrinkley,'' said, ``Certainly Iran's decision is not solelyattributable to U.S. policy, but our firmness of our militarypresence in the gulf, our indication that we planned to stay thereas long as it was necessary, and at the same time our diplomatictrack, principally at the United Nations, has finally achievedsuccess.''   Carlucci, asked about the impact of administration policy onIran, said, ``I think it's been quite significant. Don't forgetthat (Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini has consistentlysaid that he was going to drive us from the gulf.''   ``The fact that we have been resolute, that we have stood by ourfriends, that we have stood by the principles of freedom ofnavigation and that he has not been able to drive us from the gulfhas had a significant impact on Iranian thinking,'' Carlucci said.   One result of a cease-fire will be an end to the Navy'sprotection of tankers in the gulf, Carlucci said, although hedeclined to be specific about when that would occur. The Navy hasrun 49 convoys.   ``It's a little hard to make that kind of judgment at thispoint,'' he said when asked about a date.   ``We want to watch the negotiations. We'd probably want to takesome reasonable interval to make certain that the cease-fireholds,'' he said. ``But there's no desire to keep 27 ships thereany longer than possible. We would certainly draw down (the numberof U.S. ships) as soon as feasible.''   Ending the war eventually could lead to better relations betweenIran and other nations, including the United States, both men said.Iran has taken a number of steps in recent weeks to improverelations with other countries.   ``We have consistently said that we're prepared to enter into adialogue with Iran,'' Carlucci said. ``All they have to do isdesignate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us andwe'd be glad to talk with them about policy issues, aboutterrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about whatever isappropriate.''   Asked about reports the U.S. hostages might be released if thewar ends, Carlucci said, ``We're obviously not going to discuss anyquid pro quo, but if the Iranians want to talk to us about thehostage situation and how they're going to go about influencingtheir release, we'd be delighted to talk to them about it. I'm notin the slightest suggesting that there would be any deal for thehostages. That is contrary to our policy,''   Whitehead, asked about the same reports, said, ``I have noinformation (to indicate the reports are true).''   But he added that Iran's acceptance of the U.N. resolution means``we may be beginning a process in which we can begin a dialoguewith Iran about the subjects of grave concern to us, of which thehostages and terrorism are at the very top of our agenda.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Sunday the hostagesituation is easy for Iran to resolve. ``All they have to do isrelease them.''   Fitzwater, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One asPresident Reagan returned from California, said, ``We are willingto talk to anybody, anyplace, but we are not willing to negotiate.We are not willing to pay ransom. There is no need.''</TEXT></DOC>
