The Bush administration welcomed the action and called on Egyptand the Palestinians to respond promptly.   ``We still think there's a lot of work to be done, but we thinkit's a positive sign in terms of moving the process forward,'' saidpresidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.   Despite Israeli demands for U.S. assurances on various points,Fitzwater said the Cabinet's decision ``provides further impetusfor an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.''   The vote came 10 days before Shamir plans to visit the UnitedStates to meet with Jewish groups and senators. He hopes to meetwith President Bush, but the two sides have not yet agreed upon ameeting.   The inner Cabinet voted Sunday 9-3 to accept the plan designedby Secretary of State James A. Baker III.   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, who leads the left-of-centerLabor party, welcomed the decision, saying it will keep the UnitedStates involved in the search for peace.   ``I think this has great significance because we prevented theloss of America as part of the peace process,'' Peres said onIsrael Television.   Israeli media reports had said the United States might putMiddle East peace efforts aside for other issues if Baker's peaceoffer were rejected.   Ahimeir said Israel will ask for six assurances.   He said Israel wants guarantees there will be no talks with thePalestine Liberation Organization and that talks be limited toIsrael's elections proposal, which offers limited autonomy in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Baker's offer calls for an Israeli-Palestinian meeting to breaka stalemate over the stalled Israeli plan, first announced sixmonths ago.   Israel Television said another of the six assurances was thatWashington would support Israel if it left the talks because groundrules were violated.   Peres and a spokesmen for Shamir said Israel expects the U.S.assurances in writing.   Sunday's Cabinet vote was unanimously supported by Labor's sixministers but created a split in its coalition partner, Shamir'sright-wing Likud bloc. Those ministers voted 3-3.   Likud hard-liners say the Baker plan will lead to indirectnegotiations with the PLO. ``The move will bring disaster,''Industry and Trade Minister Ariel Sharon said on Israel radio.   In Cairo, the PLO's executive committee announced it had``crystalized a united position'' on the Baker plan, but memberswould not say if the organization accepted or rejected the proposal.   Should the PLO approve the plan, the next step would be forBaker to meet with Egyptian and Israeli officials to work out thecomposition of a Palestinian delegation acceptable to Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
