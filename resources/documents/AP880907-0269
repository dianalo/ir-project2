On other markets, cocoa futures were sharply lower; energyfutures were mixed; precious metals gained; livestock and meatadvanced; and grains and soybeans were mixed.   The Brazilian drought talk that has driven up coffee futuresprices on New York's Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange may bepremature, but there was little other information to trade onWednesday, analysts said.   Fears of drought damage have underpinned a dramatic rally in thecoffee market in the past month. Coffee for delivery in Septemberhas risen more than 21 cents a pound since falling to about $1.08in early August.   But it's still fairly early to be worried about drought damageto the Brazilian crop, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst with ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc. in New York.   ``To put this in perspective, in 1985, when drought trimmed thecrop back sharply, people had not begun to focus on the droughtuntil the second or third week of October and it wasn't untilThanksgiving that they began noting damage to the crop,'' she said.   But Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital MarketsInc. in New York, said conditions were becoming a little morecritical as the coffee crop approaches its flowering stage.   Badenhop said Brazil had an early, dry spring this year,resulting in unusually low soil moisture.   Brazilian weather conditions could continue to determine themarket's direction before the Sept. 19 opening of the InternationalCoffee Organization's semi-annual meeting in London.   Coffee settled 3.32 cents to 3.79 cents higher with September at$1.295 a pound.   Cocoa futures skidded to new 12{-year lows on the Coffee, Sugarandamp; Cocoa Exchange as producer and consumer nation-members of theInternational Cocoa Organization, meeting in London, began tacklingissues that threaten the existence of the price-support group.   Cocoa was $20 to $28 lower with September at $1,173 a ton.   Oil futures finished mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange,surprising many who had expected a continution of Tuesday's sharpsell-off.   Reports that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirateshad increased their crude-oil production last month caused panicselling of futures Tuesday on fears that the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries was in complete disarray.   But cooler heads prevailed Wednesday, said Michael Rothman,senior energy analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. inNew York.   ``Almost everybody in OPEC ... is producing at their quota, soyou're not seeing a widespread erosion of discipline,'' he said.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents lower to 13cents higher with October at $14.16 a barrel; heating oil was .09cent lower to .07 cent higher with October at 41.63 cents a gallon;unleaded gasoline was .13 cent lower to .10 cent higher withOctober at 42.59 cents a gallon.   The steadying of oil prices and the weakening of the dollarcontributed to a modest rally in precious metals futures on NewYork's Commodity Exchange, analysts said.   Gold settled 70 cents to $1.40 higher with October at $430.20 atroy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 6.1 cents higher with Septemberat $6.546 a troy ounce.   Livestock and meat futures posted strong gains on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange in a technically inspired reversal of Tuesday'ssteep losses, analysts said.   Frozen pork bellies for August 1989 delivery advanced thepermitted limit of 2 cents a pound following Tuesday's limitdecline in the May contract.   Live cattle were .15 cent to 1.20 cents higher with October at72.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .92 cent higherwith September at 81.65 cents a pound; hogs were .40 cent to 1.15cents higher with October at 38.35 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were 1.37 cents to 2 cents higher with February at 48.10cents a pound.   Grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the ChicagoBoard of Trade as profit-taking and harvest pressure weakenedmarkets buoyed by rumors of new export demand, analysts said.   Wheat finished slightly higher but below the day's highs, whichmatched the year's top prices for December and March deliveries.   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced a sale of300,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union.   Wheat settled 1\ cents to 2{ cents higher with September at$4.12 a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher withSeptember at $2.91} a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1{ cents lowerwith September at $2.69{ a bushel; soybeans were 5{ cents lower to5 cents higher with September at $8.82{ a bushel.</TEXT></DOC>
