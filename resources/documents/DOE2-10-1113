<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-1113 </DOCNO><TEXT>The anomalous Doppler effect is of interest as a fundamental limit onsuperthermal tail formation in Tokamak plasmas, and as a probable explantationof the relaxation oscillations seen in the soft X-ray signal from Ohmicplasmas and in association with lower hybrid current drive. In this application,the divergence of fast-electron motion from the parallel direction asthe anomalous Doppler instability proceeds is responsible for the shiftin the predominant direction of electron bremsstrahlung, which followsthe fast-electron motion. A number of studies have considered such quasilineardevelopment of the instability. The linear instability remains of interest,however, and we shall examine this aspect of the phenomenon.</TEXT></DOC>
