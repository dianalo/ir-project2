Proxies </HL><SO> </SO><CO> FGRP BTI </CO><IN> TNM INS </IN><DATELINE> RENO, Nev.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge denied a request by Farmers Group Inc. to enjoin a B.A.T Industries PLC unit from soliciting proxies for a vote on a resolution B.A.T plans to present at Farmers' annual meeting May 20.    Judge Howard McKibben, however, ordered Batus Inc., B.A.T's U.S. unit, to correct a technical statement in Batus's proxy statement regarding the non-binding resolution recommending that the Farmers board reconsider its position in dealing with B.A.T.    Meanwhile, Farmers, a Los Angeles-based insurer, and B.A.T broke off attempts to meet and discuss B.A.T's unsolicited $4.5 billion bid, and Farmers executives said they will continue discussions with an unidentified third party over a possible leveraged buy-out.    In an exchange of letters, Farmers charged the B.A.T unit with seeking &quot;preferential treatment&quot; in obtaining confidential information. B.A.T had refused to sign a confidentiality agreement proposed by Farmers, which in turn rejected amended terms proffered by the British tobacco, retailing and financial services concern.    &quot;Farmers will now proceed on the assumption that B.A.T does not wish a meeting and really has no higher price to propose,&quot; Farmers Chairman Leo E. Denlea wrote to Patrick Sheehy, chairman of Batus. Farmers executives declined to say whether Farmers had been contacted by other parties over the past few days.    Mr. Sheehy's letter repeated that B.A.T is willing to raise its $63-a-share offer, and said the increase could be substantial. He also said the confidentiality pact proposed by Farmers contained &quot;unreasonable&quot; terms. </TEXT></DOC>
