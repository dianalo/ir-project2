Foreign investors sold a net $4.2 billion of U.S. stocksand bonds in the first quarter -- the latest for which dataare available -- according to the Securities IndustryAssociation. It was first time foreigners pulled money out ofthe U.S. securities markets since the third quarter of 1983.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, evidence since then points to a continued lackof appetite on the part of foreigners for U.S. stocks andbonds, analysts said. Traditionally, foreign investors havehad a bigger influence on U.S. bond markets than on stocks,but the British and Japanese sometimes affect share prices.   The consequences can be significant for the deficit-riddenU.S., which faces increasing competition for investmentfunds. West Germany and Japan -- the big surplus nations --have turned inward, and Eastern Europe, with enormous capitalneeds to finance economic and industrial restructuring, is anew competitor for global cash. Moreover, analysts sayThailand and Malaysia, and eventually possibly even Mexicoand Brazil, are emerging as new lures for internationalinvestment capital.   &quot;We have become very dependent upon foreign investors inall of our markets. Since we now have less demand for U.S.securities than in past years, this explains why we have nothad better and more sustained bond market rallies followingpositive economic news,&quot; said Brian J. Fabbri, chiefeconomist for Midland Montagu, a U.S. securities unit ofMidland Bank PLC.   U.S. bond yields, he added, &quot;are too high consideringeconomic growth has slowed and the Fed has eased. Yet, bondyields are much higher now than they were in December. That'sbecause we have had sparse demand for our securities.&quot;   What's more, David G. Strongin, director of internationalfinance at the SIA, said these high U.S. rates could damageU.S. economic growth, raise the cost of funding the federalbudget deficit and reduce the competitiveness of U.S.corporations.   Led by Japanese investors, who sold a net $3.9 billion ofU.S. Treasury securities, foreigners in aggregate unloaded$900 million of all U.S. bonds (Treasurys, agency issues andcorporate bonds) in the first quarter after buying a net$19.9 billion in the last quarter of 1989. Overseas investorsgrew more negative on U.S. stocks, selling a net $3.3 billionfollowing a selloff of $400 million in the last quarter of1989. Swiss, British and Japanese investors were the majordumpers of U.S. stocks in the first quarter.   Behind this retreat are rising nominal andinflation-adjusted interest rates abroad, falling U.S.interest rates and lately a weakening dollar. At the sametime, there's rising interest in European and smaller Asianeconomies and stock markets.   On a semiannual compound yield basis, 10-year U.S.government bonds currently yield 8.53%. That compares with11.46% for equivalent British bonds, 8.33% for West Germanand 6.96% for Japanese bonds. At shorter maturities, foreignfixed-income securities become even more appealing.   &quot;Looking at these factors, an investor abroad has to askhimself: Why invest in the U.S.? There are betteropportunities abroad,&quot; said Nicholas P. Sargen, aninternational economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;Since thebeginning of the year, I haven't spoken to a long-termoverseas investor who is interested in substantiallyincreasing his dollar bond holdings.&quot;   In many ways, the supply and demand for internationalcapital is the reverse of what it was in the 1980s. In thelast decade -- especially in the first half of it -- foreigninvestors were drawn to high U.S. interest rates, anexpanding economy, a soaring dollar and a booming stockmarket.   During the 1980s, the U.S. pulled in more than $800billion from foreign investors, including direct investment,on relatively favorable terms, said Mr. Sargen. &quot;Japan andGermany were generating huge surpluses, and the funds thatused to go to the less developed countries weren't becausethey weren't creditworthy.&quot; That left the U.S. as the primerecipient of foreign cash.   But it's a different world in the 1990s. Bond yields aremostly higher in Europe and rising in Japan, and theircurrencies are climbing. Several European stock markets havesuffered recent setbacks after earlier runups. Still, manylong-term investors are attracted to them because of theplanned 1992 abolition of trade and investment barriers inthe 12 countries of the European Community, and because ofthe opening of Eastern Europe.   Europe is experiencing its biggest spending boom in twodecades. Added to that are the financing needs for Germanunification -- and more broadly for the reconstruction ofEastern Europe. &quot;At the margin, Europe is the buzzword,&quot; saidJohn Morosani, managing director in charge of U.S. equitiesat S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. in New York.   &quot;You'd think that with the dollar soft, foreign investorswould want to buy U.S. equities. From a value perspective,you'd think it would make our stuff look cheaper,&quot; he said.But &quot;the observed reality is that foreign investors tend tobe more interested in a U.S. market when the dollar israllying.&quot;   William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at theU.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co. in New York, said that &quot;asrates have come down here and Japanese rates have inched up,&quot;Japanese sales of U.S. bonds have continued. He added thatlately foreign investors' confidence in the Federal Reservehad weakened because of the central bank's apparent policyswitch toward attempting to bolster U.S. growth with aneasier monetary stance rather than combating inflation.   In fact, the SIA's data show that the biggest buyers --$2.9 billion -- of U.S. Treasury securities in the firstquarter were members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries. Most of them don't take a currency riskwhen buying U.S. securities, because their major incomeearner, oil, is priced in U.S. dollars.   Foreigners won't abandon U.S. securities markets. Analystssay they can't afford to, because the U.S. still representsthe world's largest single capital market and is regarded asa &quot;safe haven&quot; in times of international tension.   Still, Mr. Sargen of Salomon Brothers said: &quot;There's nodoubt the U.S. is going to be hustling for funds withcountries that we once didn't have to face as competitors inworld capital markets. And surplus countries like Japan andGermany have more investment opportunities in their ownbackyards.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
