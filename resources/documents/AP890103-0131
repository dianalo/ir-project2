DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan announced Tuesday he hasdecided against tariffs or other action to curb oil imports,although conceding that ``the free world will become increasinglydependent on oil supplies from potentially insecure sources.''   The president acted on the recommendation of Commerce SecretaryWilliam Verity, who he said reported to him that import restrictions``would not be cost effective and, in the long run, would impairrather than enhance national security.''   Verity's report was the outcome of an investigation requested inDecember 1987 by the National Energy Security Committee, a domesticoil industry group which said the president should use his powers torestrict import of goods where imports would hurt national security.   Reagan said Verity concluded that ``there has been a substantialimprovement in U.S. energy security'' since the last similarinvestigation in 1979.   ``However, declining domestic oil production, rising oil importsand growing free world dependence on potentially insecure sources ofsupply raise a number of concerns, including vulnerability to amajor supply disruption,'' the president said.   ``The investigation found that the maintenance of U.S. access tosufficient supplies of petroleum is essential to our economicsecurity, foreign policy flexibility and defense preparedness,'' hesaid. ``Given these factors, the secretary of commerce found thatpetroleum imports threaten to impair the national security.''   Imports of crude oil and refined products currently are runningat about 41 percent of consumption, up from 31.5 percent in 1985 butnot yet back to the 47.7 percent recorded in 1977, the peak year forimports. Several forecasts, including those of the EnergyDepartment, predict that imports will reach and pass 50 percent inthe 1990s.   A department study concluded in 1987 that a $10-a-barrel tariffwould add 120,000 jobs in the oil industry but cost 400,000elsewhere in the economy; would bring $46 billion worth of benefitsat a cost of $200 billion. Secretary John Herrington has saidexemptions that would be politically necessary in any tariff plan toaccommodate Canada and residential users of home heating oil in theU.S. Northeast would make it unworkable.   Reagan said that, in deciding not to recommend any importrestrictions, Verity took into account the administration's programto improve energy security.   In particular, Reagan cited decontrol of oil prices andelimination of allocation controls as actions his administration hastaken to strengthen the domestic oil industry.   ``The Strategic Petroleum Reserve contains over 555 millionbarrels, compared to 108 million barrels eight years ago,'' he said.   ``Today the nation is far less vulnerable to an oil supplydisruption than in 1973 or 1979,'' he added.   ``Despite these improvements, important energy security concernsremain,'' the president said, citing rising oil consumption,declining U.S. crude production and rising oil imports.   ``In addition, projections show that the free world will becomeincreasingly dependent on oil supplies from potentially insecuresources.''   In a message to Congress that accompanied his statement, thepresident urged the lawmakers to deregulate natural gas prices,permit expanded oil exploration in Alaska and the Outer ContinentalShelf, liberalize the depletion allowance for oil and gas producers,streamline nuclear power licensing procedures and sell the NavalPetroleum Reserves at Elk Hills, Calif., and Teapot Dome, Wyo.   The administration has advocated all these measures in Congressin recent years, but without success.   The 1979 study was requested by the Treasury Department in 1978.Based on that study, then-President Carter determined that oilimports were a threat to U.S. security.</TEXT></DOC>
