(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 325 employees at the Department ofEnergy's Y-12 nuclear weapons plant will be getting layoff noticeswithin the next week, plant officials said.   Also, operators of the federal Fernald uranium processing plantin Ohio announced about 130 workers are being laid off.   The Tennessee layoffs at the 6,900-employee plant are the resultof a $7 million cut in its $590 million fiscal 1990 budget, saidRobert Wesley, spokesman for Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc.   Martin Marietta, which manages the plant under a DOE contract,said last week that Gramm-Rudman cuts could chop an additional $20million to $25 million from the Y-12 budget, causing more layoffs.   Wesley said Monday it could be weeks before it's known whetherthe plant will have to absorb Gramm-Rudman reductions.   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, which operates the DOE'sFeed Materials Production Center, said its layoffs of productionworkers take effect Dec. 15.   Plant spokeman Bob Walker said Westinghouse anticipates a $6million shortfall in its fiscal 1990 budget. He said if Congressenacts additional reductions, more layoffs at could follow.   Production at the plant near Fernald, an unincorporatedcommunity 20 miles northwest of Cincinnati, has been suspendedwhile the site undergoes inspection and cleanup.   A Westinghouse statement said the company has no schedule forrestart of uranium processing ``in the near future.''   The 38-year-old plant processes uranium for use in EnergyDepartment nuclear reactors elsewhere in the government'sproduction of nuclear weapons.   Westinghouse suspended production in July to concentrate oncleaning up the plant's 1,050-acre site, where thousands of poundsof radioactive wastes are stored in steel drums and ground pits.   Environmentalists say the plant and its radioactive wastes andemissions threaten the atmosphere and the Great Miami Riveraquifer, a regional water resource.</TEXT></DOC>
