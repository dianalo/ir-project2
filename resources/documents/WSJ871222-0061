Salwen</HL><DD> 12/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices, propelled by what some traders said was renewed investor confidence, followed through on last week's gains to close at their highest levels since Nov. 2.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 1990.38, up 15.08, on moderate volume, much of which came early in the day. Trading totaled 161.8 million shares, well below the 276.2 million shares traded in Friday's &quot;triple witching hour&quot; session, when stock options, stock option futures and stock index futures all had to be settled on the same day. Advancing issues outpaced losers yesterday by 947-707.    Despite the market's failure to breach the 2000 level, traders were cheered by the gains, which followed last week's 108.26point increase.    &quot;I would call this a confident market,&quot; Ernest Rudnet, manager of block trading at Mabon, Nugent in New York, said. &quot;People seem to have a lot more faith in where we are and where we're heading.&quot;    Some institutional investors have begun returning to the stock market in the past few weeks, Mr. Rudnet said, and have been easing out of fixed-income investments and cash.    &quot;Institutions are becoming more confident about the earnings picture of the quality stocks in the first and second quarters and are willing to commit capital,&quot; he said.    The industrial average gained more than 15 points in the first hour of trading on heavy volume.    &quot;It was a follow-through to the strong buying on Friday,&quot; A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, New York, said. Some investors had held back Friday out of concern for the effects of the triple witching hour, which occurs once a quarter and sometimes has caused wide price swings. The industrial average closed Friday with a 50.90-point gain.    Yesterday, stocks gave back some of their early morning gains and traded in a narrow range until another rally in the final hour pushed the industrials back above 1990.    Traders said the market appears to be winding down to a holiday pace.    &quot;Most of the players seem to be taking the holiday week off,&quot; John Burnett, a senior vice president on Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette's block trading desk, said. &quot;It's like a Friday afternoon in the summertime.&quot;    But, Mr. Burnett said, there still seems to be &quot;a bias toward the upside&quot; in the market.    &quot;I think the market will continue to act well through year end,&quot; he said.    Mr. Moore of Argus Research agreed.    &quot;The 'Santa Claus rally' will arrive on time, and then we stand to move through the 1990-2000 resistance area,&quot; he said. But he said he expects stock prices to remain in a relatively narrow range for the next few days.    &quot;There's no outside assistance, no help from the other financial markets or outside forces to help the market along here,&quot; Mr. Moore said.    Prices of the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell yesterday, providing little support to the stock market, and the dollar slipped slightly.    Investors' spirits continued to be bolstered, however, by the oil-price picture. Although the oil market was relatively steady yesterday, compared with last week's price plunge, crude oil for January delivery still eased in both New York and London. The lower prices &quot;help balance the inflation picture,&quot; Donaldson's Mr. Burnett said.    Oil stocks were mixed. Exxon slipped 1/2 to 39 1/2, Phillips Petroleum was down 3/8 to 10 5/8, and Chevron eased 3/8 to 38 1/4. But investors and some analysts turned bullish on some oil-related issues.    &quot;I like to look back to when we had oil prices of $11 a barrel last year,&quot; Mabon's Mr. Rudnet said, compared with a little more than $15 currently. &quot;Some of these stocks are trading at lower levels now.&quot;    Prudential-Bache Securities oil analyst Frank P. Knuettel pointed out that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet again at some point to try to stabilize prices, and he said the oil companies' cash flows are &quot;appreciably stronger&quot; than the last time oil prices fell.    Mr. Knuettel considers Amoco, Atlantic Richfield and Mobil the three best buys in the group, with USX, Amerada Hess and Royal Dutch Petroleum also rated highly.    In trading yesterday, Amoco rose 1 1/4 to 68 1/4, Arco slid 1/8 to 65 1/2, Mobil gained 1/4 to 37 3/4, USX was up 5/8 at 30 5/8, Amerada Hess rose 3/8 to 23 7/8, and Royal Dutch gained 1 5/8 to 108 1/4.    Texaco and Pennzoil both lost ground after the companies' $3 billion settlement of their lawsuit over the weekend. Pennzoil closed at 77 1/2, down 1 7/8; Texaco, the Big Board's most active issue, slipped 1 to 37 1/2 on volume of 3.7 million shares.    Traders said the settlement had been discounted by investors over the past few weeks and that both sides had reason to be unhappy with the accord.    &quot;I was very disappointed to see Texaco have to pay anything in the suit,&quot; Robert DeLong, head trader at First Pennsylvania Bank, Philadelphia, said. As for Pennzoil, he said, &quot;Something's better than nothing, certainly, but it's not as much as some people had hoped for.&quot;    Singer dropped 5 1/2 to 43 1/2 amid investor skepticism that a $50-a-share bid from investor Paul Bilzerian will be completed. Singer said earlier that talks with the Bilzerian group, which holds 9.9% of the defense contractor, hadn't given the company confidence that the group can finance the offer.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific slipped 1/2 to 47 1/2. Henley Group said Santa Fe should seek to &quot;maximize the value of its shares for all Santa Fe holders.&quot; Henley said Friday that it turned down a Santa Fe offer to buy back 23 million shares, or 14.7% of the Santa Fe common outstanding, from Henley.    Several blue-chips were solid performers. General Motors gained 1 to 63 3/8 after the auto maker said it will have a profit on its European operations this year after several years of losses.    Boeing rose 1 1/4 to 39 1/8, Du Pont jumped 3 3/8 to 86 1/2, and International Business Machines gained 1 to 118 1/4. Among the blue-chip issues that lost ground were American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, down 7/8 to 28 1/4 and McDonald's, down 1/8 to 45.    Allied-Signal, which announced a joint venture with West Germany's Siemens in automotive electronics manufacturing, slipped 7/8 to 28 1/8.    In the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer gained 1 1/4 to 41 3/4 after the company said a California state court dismissed charges against it in a class-action suit. The charges involved Apple's disclosure of information about its Lisa computer between November 1982 and September 1983. </TEXT></DOC>
