Over the past decade, Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., TennecoInc. and America West Airlines Inc. all have begun sponsoringtheir own clinics. In July, Quad/Graphics Inc., a closelyheld printing company, will open a clinic in Pewaukee, Wis.;it plans eventually to provide medical care for all itsnearly 5,000 employees. The Stouffer Corp. unit of NestleS.A. also expects to open a clinic for 4,000 Cleveland-areaemployees this year.   Company-run clinics fell out of fashion decades ago, butbusinesses that continued to offer onsite care -- includingSouthern California Edison Co., Gillette Co. and Gates Corp.-- say it helps check unnecessary diagnostic tests andeliminates costly, inconvenient paper work. The clinics alsoavoid the cost-shifting that occurs when doctors boostcharges to company-insured patients to offset lower paymentsfor Medicare and Medicaid patients.   Southern California Edison estimates that its clinics,which date back to 1903, keep costs about 20% below whatthey'd be on the open market.   Some consulting firms see business for themselves inequipping clinics and contracting with doctors when companiesdon't want to do that work independently. Using a middlemanmay also guard against violations of confidentiality. &quot;If amanager asks whether Joe was in the clinic, we say, `That'snone of your business,' &quot; says C. Victor Williams, presidentof MediCenter Inc., which has opened three clinics forGoodyear.   Still, this type of venture is a big step for mostcompanies. Since opening a dental center last year, FortHoward Corp. has given some thought to taking on the greatercomplexities of a medical clinic. But &quot;the idea scares us alot more than this {dental center} does,&quot; says MichaelRiordan, a personnel executive at the company.                                                                                                          Du Pont Is Heading Off   Cost of Back Injuries                                                                                                          FOR THREE YEARS, chemical and oil giant Du Pont Co. hasbeen waging an allout campaign against employee backinjuries, and the company is beginning to see results.   Du Pont estimates that back problems, whether fromon-the-job or at-home injuries, cost it $40 million in 1987at its U.S. operations alone, considering employee pay duringlost workdays and medical expenses.   But a preliminary calculation, based on surveys at severalplants whose findings are extrapolated to others, indicatesthe company saved $10 million last year in the U.S. By 1992,the company intends to cut bad-back costs world-wide by $50million annually.   Some 500 employees helped set up prevention programs attheir worksites. About 50,000 -- a third of the work force --have gotten several hours of training. Between $8 million and$12 million has been invested in the effort to date.   A few of the preventive measures are state of the art. Oneof Du Pont's consultants, Biomechanics Corp. of America, hasprovided hundreds of pocket-sized, electrode-equipped&quot;ergometers,&quot; which measure the force of muscle contractionsduring training sessions. The signal from an overstressedmuscle prompts a warning tone.   Other steps are simple, such as unloading heavy bags on anelevated platform so that workers don't have to stoop to liftthem.                                                                                                          Rhode Island Doctors   Team Up for High Tech                                                                                                          THE EMERGENCE of big ticket medical technology oftenraises questions about how wisely it will be used afterhospitals have rushed to buy it. Now, hospitals in RhodeIsland have allayed these concerns through an intensivestatewide training program that uses shared equipment.   With encouragement from state health planners, all 10 ofthe private general hospitals in Rhode Island formed anetwork in 1988 to buy and share magnetic resonance scanners,the latest generation of diagnostic imaging equipment. Twofixed-site machines and one rotated among hospitals bytrailer are operating now, and another mobile unit will beadded this summer.   The training takes radiologists through 160 hours ofcourse work and hands-on instruction. That is followed by 80hours of &quot;overreading,&quot; in which the doctors workindependently but have the images given a second look byoutside experts. Nineteen doctors have been certified by thenetwork so far.   &quot;One of the concerns about high-tech equipment is that itreplaces the thought process, that it's just used to shotgunall comers,&quot; says Herbert Kressel, a radiologist at theUniversity of Pennsylvania, and medical director for theRhode Island network.   He adds that magnetic resonance imaging is especiallycomplicated by frequent changes in the computer software. Butabout 70% of scans done in Rhode Island discover a medicalproblem -- the same rate of positive findings that he wouldexpect at a top university hospital.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          SIXTY-NINE PERCENT of chief executives believe high costsand limited access to high-tech equipment will create a&quot;two-tier medical care system, one for the rich and one forthe poor,&quot; according to responses from 736 CEOs to a surveyby William M. Mercer Inc., employee benefit consultants. . .. In Newark, N.J., the Prudential Foundation puts up $65,000to support a van staffed by medical personnel that will makehouse calls to children in housing projects.</TEXT></DOC>
