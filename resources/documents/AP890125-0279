A Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer spent two yearsinvestigating Drexel and told superiors he had evidence of afraudulent scheme to disguise ownership of stocks and manipulatestock prices, the Wall Street Journal reported.   In a 33-page confidential memo, SEC attorney John Hewitt chargedthat Milken, Drexel's high-yield ``junk bond'' financier, hadmanipulated the price of shares of Reliance Group Inc., an insuranceholding company run by takeover strategist Saul Steinberg, thenewspaper said.   The Journal did not disclose where the October 1983 memo wasobtained. But the SEC's chief enforcement officer Gary Lynch saidthe newspaper received the material from an unidentifiedcongressional committee.   The newspaper also reported that between 1980 and 1985 four SECinvestigations implicated Drexel and Milken but all were closedwithout action.   The SEC investigation was said to focus on trading in the stockof Reliance and Leasco Corp., another Steinberg company, before andafter a July 1981 announcement that the companies would be mergedand taken private in 1982.   The Journal said Hewitt wrote that ``securities were warehousedand manipulated in a complex scheme to facilitate'' the transaction.Warehousing involves placing stocks in accounts that disguiseownership.   But the probe was dropped in March 1984 because of lack ofevidence, the Journal said.   The SEC last September filed civil charges against Drexel andMilken accusing them of scheming with now-imprisoned inside traderIvan Boesky to commit securities fraud.   On Tuesday, the government made public the six specific fraudcounts that Drexel has agreed to plead guilty to as part of a record$650 million settlement that concluded a two-year inquiry by theU.S. attorney's office.   The government accused Drexel with participating in a litany ofcriminal acts ranging from insider trading to stock manipulationinvolving some of the biggest U.S. takeover targets of the 1980s.   In the 1983 Hewitt memo, the Journal account said, the SECinvestigator said that from 1979 through at least 1983 Milken ran``a trading scheme ... to warehouse and manipulate securities forthe benefit of certain (high-yield department) clients.''   Hewitt also said two investment partnerships including Milken andhis brother, Lowell, also appeared to have violated federaldisclosure laws, the Journal account said.   A spokesman for Milken denied any wrongdoing in the 1983allegations. Drexel said in a statement that ``these were thoroughinvestigations, and to assume otherwise isn't well-founded.''   ``But the point is that having already reached an agreement withthe U.S. attorney, we now are in good-faith negotiations with theSEC to establish enhanced procedures that will prevent even theappearance of these kinds of issues in the future,'' it said.   The Journal said the investigation of Milken and Drexel beganwhen Reliance was cited as one of eight stocks the SEC examinedafter spotting unusual price increases on New Year's Eve 1981.   Lynch told the newspaper: ``I think you ought to put high up inyour story that you were provided with non-public documents by acommittee of Congress. Because that's how Washington works. ... Ithink it stinks.''   He did not identify the committee. But Rep. John Dingell,D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whichmonitors the SEC, was quoted by the newspaper as saying of the 1983probe: ``The SEC didn't use the tools Congress gave it to protectinvestors, in this instance.''</TEXT></DOC>
