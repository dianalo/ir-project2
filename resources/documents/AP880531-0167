SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LENINGRAD (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nancy Reagan contended Tuesday that``everything has been said'' about the flap over her astrology usein the White House, but she let it be known she intends to tell herside of the story in her own time.   Mrs. Reagan, on a summit sidetrip to this Baltic capital of theczars, dismissed reporters' repeated attempts to discuss therevelation that she has consulted astrologers to advise PresidentReagan on his schedule.   It was the first time reporters had the opportunity to questionher closely about the flap that arose last month when former WhiteHouse chief of staff Donald Regan published his book, ``For theRecord,'' revealing the first lady's secret.   The former chief of staff painted an unflattering portrait ofthe first couple, describing President Reagan as an incurious,passive chief executive controlled by a manipulative wife andmedia-conscious staff.   Regan also made clear his bitterness at being replaced at theWhite House at the height of the Iran-Contra affair, contendinghe'd been ousted by a cabal controlled and initiated by the firstlady.   At first, Mrs. Reagan refused to be drawn into any discussion ofthe matter, declaring, ``Everything has been said about that thatneeds to be said.''   At one point, she was asked whether the ``stars were wrong'' forproviding an answer, and she gave the reporter a sharp, disgustedlook.   But when she was asked again whether she intended to write herown book about the flap, she responded, ``Could be,'' and laughedheartily.   Queried whether she intended to go into detail in such a book,she borrowed a line from a Frank Sinatra song to indicate that shewas intent on telling her side of the story.   ``My way,'' she said, pointing at herself and repeating sternly,``My way.''   And will Regan be interested in what she had to say?   The first lady laughed again heartily and shot back,``Absolutely.''</TEXT></DOC>
