California's winter crop hasbeen decimated by a whitefly infestation. Perhaps $100million of cantaloupes, cauliflower, broccoli and lettuce lieruined. Probable causes of the blight are warm weather,possibly an intensive type of agriculture that provides hostsfor the insects virtually year-round -- and the flies'resistance to pesticide. The devastation of these cropsraises anew the question of whether this country's recurringphobias over chemicals and the regulatory apparatus thatpolitics has erected around the development of newagricultural chemicals leave the country poorly prepared todeal with problems such as an onslaught of whiteflies.   The institution created to protect us from chemicals isthe Environmental Protection Agency. One can argue that theEPA is to agriculture what the Food and Drug Administrationis to pharmaceuticals -- a drag on the introduction ofscientific technology.</LP><TEXT>   It helps to be mindful that an agency like this one tosome extent reflects the collective acts of the U.S.Congress. And most agencies have a variety of divisions, somedisposed to letting private producers flourish, othersantagonistic to the interests of industry. That said, let'ssee how the EPA figures in the future of the U.S. supply offresh fruits and vegetables.   In the infamous case of Alar, the agency'scarcinogen-assessment staff and ultimately the topadministrators played ball with the scaremongers whoeventually won the removal of this apple harvest-enhancerfrom use.   Since that occurred in early 1989, the case against Alarhas been progressively discredited, but the verdict ofpopular fear seems to be permanent and the chemical isunlikely to return. The result has been a significantdrop-off in output of some varieties, such as the McIntosh,that are most prone to fall to waste when ripe. Earlierpicking schedules of more common types have gotten majorproducers around Alar's absence but may be shortening theretailing calendar.   Outright bans are rare. Chemicals regulation usually slowsinnovation more quietly, by imposing barriers to newapplications. Consider the case of the whitefly and NTN-3383,a promising alternative to existing pesticides that is beingdeveloped by Mobay Corp., a unit of Bayer-USA.   On average, such a product seeking EPA &quot;registration,&quot; orapproval, faces a five- to 10-year process costing $35million to $50 million, by industry estimate. This typicallyincludes more than 100 different tests, plus follow-ups,documented in excruciating detail. One, the so-called avianfield study, will have cost Mobay $2 million, according todevelopment manager Walt Mullins. As the name suggests, it'san open-area test for harm to birds, to avoid another SilentSpring (if there was a first one). Problem is, the results ofsuch a sample are so vague -- by nature, you might say --that &quot;you can't say for certain&quot; that even the placebos usedare harmless to birds, according to Mr. Mullins.   Because most crops consumed fresh are only lightly dustedwith pesticides, they are called &quot;minor uses&quot; by theagricultural-chemical makers. Not much of any single compoundis sold, at least compared with the stuff used on the bigcommodity crops such as wheat, corn and soybeans. So in manycases it just doesn't pay to spend up to $50 million beforeeven chancing the marketplace. Mobay believes it is luckywith NTN, that it may be useful on hundreds of differentplants and even home lawns, so that it can be sold insufficient volume to cover the costs. But that's exceptional.   The testing threshold has been steadily raised throughepisodes such as the Alar travesty. But that doesn't meanthat previously approved substances are home free. Underlegislation Congress enacted three years ago, the EPA mustre-register agricultural chemicals OK'd before 1984. Theindustry estimates that'll run $8 million to $10 millionapiece. About 400 compounds are vying for renewal. Half againas many won't even be put to the test, though many of thoseare no longer used anyway. The apple industry alone has lostabout 15 chemicals in the past few years, a major Washingtonstate grower says.   Thus, the regulatory meter is rapidly running up the tabon test dollars that could be going into finding new,possibly safer products to increase the supply and decreasethe price of an undeniably healthful component of ournation's diet -- fresh fruits and vegetables. Costs aredriven up by an often vain pursuit of the finer and finermeasurements of safety that advanced science permits.   Agriculture is a critical but hardly unique example ofthis unproductive obsession. Some way out -- a new Congress,a more resolute executive branch, a media more skeptical ofscares or even a creditable scientific appeals body -- needsto be found so that costs can be better equated with thebenefits of avoiding harm from real toxic threats. Atpresent, the whiteflies are winning.</TEXT></DOC>
