Nielsen Co. with a monopoly in the business of television audience measurement.    AGB, a unit of AGB Research PLC, London, introduced people meters to the audience measurement market in 1985 -- a move followed by Nielsen -- but AGB said it couldn't afford to operate in the U.S. without the support of all three television networks.    CBS Inc. has used both AGB and Nielsen, but the other two networks, General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. and Capital Cities/ABC Inc., use only Nielsen.    Separately, AGB said it intends to merge with Mediamark Research Inc., a U.S. consumer-survey data base that provides information about the size and characteristics of magazine audiences. Subject to shareholder approval, AGB said it will acquire all of MRI from its parent, MAI PLC, and from two MRI directors. MAI, a British financial, media and information-services concern, will own a 30% interest in AGB.    Officials at Nielsen, a Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. unit, couldn't be reached for comment.    Speaking for AGB, MRI chairman Timothy Joyce said: &quot;I think the complexity of the television medium advanced so rapidly -- in terms of the extension of cable, the importance of syndication, the penetration of VCRs -- that the costs for what {AGB} was doing were far in excess of what was forecast.&quot;    At CBS, vice president of marketing David Poltrack called AGB's departure unfortunate. &quot;We obviously felt that development of audience-measurement systems was best accomplished in a competitive framework,&quot; he said. CBS paid AGB $3.5 million a year for its service and paid Nielsen about $4.9 million, he said. Advertisers also used AGB's services, but many preferred Nielsen because Nielsen's audience-rating figures were used by all three broadcasters.    Mr. Poltrack called it unlikely that another competitor would emerge. &quot;Here's a company that came along against fairly significant odds, mounted an alternative service, invested a substantial amount of money in doing it, and didn't get industry support,&quot; he said. &quot;It's unlikely another company would come along willing to make the same type of investment.&quot;    MRI's Mr. Joyce noted that AGB has &quot;suspended, not terminated,&quot; its service, and he said it might re-enter the U.S. market for audience research, although not with a daily reporting service.    An NBC spokesman declined to comment and an ABC spokesman didn't return calls seeking comment.    AGB said suspension of its U.S. service would result in a smaller dividend for its last quarter ended April 30. AGB also estimated pretax profits for 1988 at &quot;not less than&quot; $18 million, or earnings per common share of 24 cents-21% over last year's earnings. That figure takes into account an extraordinary charge of $76 million for the suspension of the U.S. TV audience-measurement service.    Nielsen, the longtime keeper of network ratings, for 30 years used a diary method for measuring TV viewership. But before the 1987-88 viewing season, Nielsen switched to people meters -- hand-held, computerized measurement devices. Test data from such meters suggested that audiences for many network programs were smaller than previously thought, causing turmoil in the $8 billion TV-network-advertising industry. But the meters have prevailed. </TEXT></DOC>
