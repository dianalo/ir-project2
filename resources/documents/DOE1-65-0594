Selectiveinhibition of restriction endonucleases Bam HI and Pst I, as well asexonuclease III, occurs at or near oligo d(G) sites, demonstrating thatcis-DDP binds preferentially to such sequences. Similarly, binding ofcis-DDP to (dG)/sub n/ (n {ge} 2) sequences of a primed viral DNA templatefrom bacteriophage M13mp8 inhibits synthesis of the second strand bythe large fragment of DNA polymerase I. Studies employing antibodiesto cis-DDP-modified DNA and enzymes to degrade platinated DNA to smallfragments, followed by NMR spectroscopic analysis, demonstrate that coordinationof adjacent guanosines occurs in the primary adduct formed by cis-DDPwith DNA in vitro and in vivo. An oligonucleotide containing a cis-DDP-[d(GpG)]site has been synthesized and ligated into a specific gap in the M13genome in order to investigate the processing of this adduct in vivo.</TEXT></DOC>
