Michel Aoun, security sources said Thursday.   Sources in Moslem west Beirut said the session scheduled forSaturday may be postponed for a few days to give ChristianParliamentarians a last chance to convince Aoun to back the ArabLeague-brokered plan.   But the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said themeeting will take place before Tuesday, in compliance with theaccord approved by Parliament at a special session in Taif, SaudiArabia, last month.   The accord, aimed at ending a 14-year-old civil war, shiftspolitical power to the Moslem majority, revamping a politicalsystem formed in the 1940s when Christians were the majority. Aounsays the plan lacks a fixed timetable for the withdrawal of 40,000Syrian troops backing Moslem forces.   Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dualgovernment, has threatened to dissolve the 99-seat house if itconvened to elect a speaker, elect a head of state and ratify the``national reconciliation charter'' to which he is opposed.   No one officially has declared their candidacy for president,although two parliamentarians have said they would run. They areElias Hrawi, from east Lebanon, and Rene Moawwad, of north Lebanon,both Maronite Christians.   Aoun has called Christian Parliamentarians who approved theaccord ``traitors.'' Most Christian politicians, militia commandersand spiritual leaders also have backed the accord.   In his latest statement Thursday, he stopped short of repeatinga threat to dissolve Parliament. But he said: ``Continuing withsuch constitutional violations and hypocrisy would force us to takedecisive measures ... to safeguard the constitution.''   He did not specify what he planned to do.   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, assistant seceratry-general of the 22-nationArab League, told the newspaper An-Nahar that arrangements havebeen completed to secure a one-mile radius neutral zone aroundVilla Mansour, the proposed venue of Saturday's debate in theno-man's land of Beirut's dividing Green Line.   Reached later at the Summerland Hotel in west Beirut, Ibrahimisaid the area will be patrolled by the Lebanese police under thesupervision of nine Algerian officers who arrived earlier in theweek for that purpose.   Ibrahimi, an Algerian, would not give other details.   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line withregulations, said the Lebanese force will comprise 300 men and bedeployed on Friday evening ``if no postponement of the session isannounced.''   ``The whole police force in Beirut will be on alert to provideback-up, if needed,'' he added.   The peace plan emerged after 23 days of wrangling on politicalreforms sought by Moslems, and the Christians' demand for a fixedtimetable for a Syrian troop withdrawal from Lebanon.   The Moslems obtained some concessions: mainly an increase ofParliament seats to 108 divided equally between Christians andMoslems, and a cutback in the powers of the Christian president togive the Parliament speaker and prime minister, traditionallyMoslems, a wider share in the decision-making process.   Under an unwritten covenant dating from independence from theFrench in 1943, the president is a Maronite, the prime minister aSunni and the Parliament Speaker a Shiite.   But Aoun complained the accord referred only to a phased Syrianwithdrawal from the Beirut region in two years, without anycommitment for a total pullout.   The Syrians maintain its troops in Lebanon under a 1976 ArabLeague peacekeeping mandate.   Twenty-eight Parliamentarians have refused to return home afterthe Taif meeting, fearing action against them by supporters ofAoun. They gathered in Paris.   On Thursday, they agreed to send two representatives, GeorgeSaadeh, who heads the largest Christian political group, thePhalange Party, and Kazem Khalil, to meet with Aoun before Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
