Feb. 29   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega ofPanama:   Gen. Manuel Noriega, Panama's drug-running strongman, seemsstill to be in control of his troubled nation.   Washington has been trying for months to figure out a way todepose Noriega, who recently was indicted in Miami on charges ofdrug trafficking. Obviously, the U.S. government was involved inPresident Eric Arturo Delvalle's attempt to dismiss Noriega fromcommand of Panama's defense force.   The maneuver may eventually contribute to an erosion of supportfor Noriega among the country's military officer corps. But so far,most of those in the echelons below Noriega either are in cahootswith the general or too afraid to buck him.   Noriega also faces strong opposition from the public, many ofwhom rioted last summer because of the country's declining economyand reports of corruption at the top.   Noriega has got to go, and the United States should do all itcan to hasten that event. This should include an economic squeeze,by Washington and other capitals, that could cause increasedresentment against the general.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 29   Baltimore Sun on military spending:   When a secretary of the Navy jumps ship or walks the plank, itis fitting that he made a big splash.   James E. Webb has done just that by unleashing a petulant attackon Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, a veteran public servantwho has taken on the tough, thankless job of bringing Pentagonspending and planning into the realm of reality. ...   In the end, Carlucci ordered the scrapping of 16 aging frigatesas part of a $12 billion cut in fiscal 1989 Navy spending. This wasa sensible decision, in keeping with plans for a lean but toughdefense establishment. ...   Webb's spectacular manner of departure may have one beneficialeffect. It could trigger a defense debate that most Washingtonpoliticians would prefer to put off until the November elections.   The next president and the next Congress need to avoid sharppeaks and valleys in military spending and to devise a defensestrategy that is compatible with the nation's resources,commitments and priorities.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 24   Salem (Ore.) Statesman-Journal on Jimmy Swaggart:   A repentant Jimmy Swaggart has confessed and apologized publiclyfor sins of sexual misconduct. ...   With this latest scandal, the tendency among much of the publicmay be to condemn all radio and television religious ministries.   That would be understandable, but it also would be a mistake.Some of these programs, a few dating back for 40 years or more,have a clean record of service and financial accountability.Nevertheless, they often are smeared with the same broad brush.   Swaggart, (Jim) Bakker and other dimming stars of the glitzyworld of television evangelism need our compassion, but they alsoneed to clean up their lives and their organizations.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 26   The McPherson (Kan.) Sentinel on the arrest of an absenteesenator:   We had thought that House Speaker Jim Wright had sunk to thebottom depths in congressional decorum a couple of months ago whenhe had the effrontery to make time stand still in order to gainpassage of a bill he wanted.   But after Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd's actions (last)week, Wright is barely running a close second.   We have often thought that Congress resembled a circus more thanit resembles the world's greatest deliberative body, but Byrd madeit complete with Keystone Kops ... when he ordered the arrest ofRepublican Bob Packwood in order to get a quorum.   We hope, of course, that Byrd's tactic ... was worth suchdespicable conduct, because Byrd has certainly degraded bothhimself and the Senate.   Somehow we can't help but doubt that it was.</TEXT><TEXT>   Feb. 25   The Times of Trenton, N.J., on the new tax laws:   There's a variation of the popular TV game show ``Jeopardy!''that you can play by calling your local Internal Revenue Serviceoffices. Ask them a technical question about the 1986 tax lawchanges that go into effect this year.   What's the ``jeopardy'' part? Well, one fourth of the time theanswer will be wrong. ...   But if you rely on that answer when you file your return, andunderpay your tax as a result, you're still subject to a penaltyand interest for underpaying.   A year ago ... the new tax witholding forms ... turned out to beso arcane that the (IRS) had to waive deadlines and develop newforms.   It's hard to figure out how a law that was so widely understoodand welcomed _ as an effort to make the tax code more fair, logicaland efficient _ could have spawned such confusion.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
