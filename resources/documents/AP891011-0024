Citing the new evidence, attorneys for the controllers asked theMerit Systems Protection Board to reopen the cases.   ``Right or wrong they (the controllers) were entitled to theirday in court,'' attorney Phillip S. Wood said Tuesday. ``If itturns out the entire evidentiary product was phony and theydestroyed the original evidence, what else is there?''   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said he had no comment on the petitionfiled by Wood and attorney Gary Klein.   The board upheld the firings in 1985 based on Federal AviationAdministration attendance records, which showed that the Chicagocontrollers failed to report to work during the strike.   But a House panel last month said FAA officials doctoredevidence and lied to the board when they said the time sheets usedto defend the firings were the same ones kept during the strike.   Instead, the subcommittee's report said, FAA officials set up a``war room'' at the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center inAurora, Ill., and for three months created records to replaceoriginal, shoddy documents.   Wood said the controllers want their jobs back. He said he wasnot disputing whether the controllers failed to report to workduring the strike by the Professional Air Traffic ControllersOrganization.   Rather, like the subcommittee, Wood said he was concerned aboutthe FAA records placed before the appeals board.   ``The board has to look beyond the litigants here,'' he said.``It has to look at the integrity of the system. How can anyone winwhen the FAA pulled what it pulled here?''   The petition to reopen the cases was filed last week.   The House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee has askedthe Justice Department to investigate current and former FAAofficials for possible criminal misconduct.   During the strike, President Reagan fired 11,500 controllers,including about 450 in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
