Keating Jr. remained behind barsafter a California state-court judge refused to reduce the $5million bail imposed early last week on the indicted formerchairman of American Continental Corp.   The unusual two-day bail hearing, filled with allegationsby the state of deception by the four defendants andcountercharges of prosecutorial grandstanding, presages acontentious trial for the 66-year-old Arizona businessman.</LP><TEXT>   The indictment launched the first criminal case resultingfrom the 1989 collapse of Lincoln Savings, among the largestthrift failures ever.   The state alleges that Mr. Keating and three associatesmade fraudulent claims in selling unsecured AmericanContinental subordinated debentures through the Phoenix,Ariz., holding company's Lincoln branches in California.   Prosecutors said they identified 17,458 of about 23,000bondholders who incurred losses totaling $250 million whenAmerican Continental filed for federal bankruptcy-courtprotection last April, rendering the bonds practicallyworthless.   Judge Gary Klausner, who stunned defendants last Tuesdaywith bail far higher than amounts they had informallydiscussed before surrendering to the Los Angeles Countydistrict attorney's office, again surprised Stephen C. Neal,a Keating attorney, on Friday. Mr. Neal argued that hisclient's bail should be reduced because there was a low riskhe would flee from prosecution.   The embattled Mr. Keating, who claims that his liabilitiesexceed assets by $5.2 million, is interested only &quot;inpreparing a vigorous, strong defense&quot; against the variouscriminal and civil charges facing him, the lawyer said.   But after sharply lowering the $1 million bail for theother defendants, the judge said that the &quot;picture paintedhere . . .  {of} creditors knocking at the door and lawsuitsall around him&quot; gives Mr. Keating &quot;significant reasons not tostay around.&quot; Of the $5 million bail, Judge Klausner notedthat &quot;simple calculation will tell you it's 2% of what theactual loss was.&quot;   District Attorney Ira Reiner hailed the high bail as anexample for white-collar criminals, saying Mr. Keating's mugshot &quot;ought to be posted in every boardroom in the UnitedStates.&quot; Mr. Reiner, who led a seven-month grand juryinvestigation of American Continental's bond-sales practices,told a news conference: &quot;Whether someone wears an expensivesuit or a cheap mask, stealing is stealing.&quot;   Asked about why a man once considered among Arizona'sleading citizens would flee, Mr. Reiner said one &quot;can'tescape the thought of Robert Vesco in a case like this.&quot; Mr.Vesco, accused of masterminding the huge I.O.S. Ltd.investment scam, fled in 1973 to Central America and remainsa wealthy fugitive.   Mr. Reiner brushed off criticism of his office by thejudge, who expressed from the bench being &quot;troubled&quot; by howprosecutors first favored much lower bail, then urged noreduction. Defense attorneys suggested the change in positionreflected the heavy anti-Keating publicity the case hasgarnered.   Mr. Keating wore the rumpled blue suit he exchanged forcounty-jail grays for his court appearances, and seemed atease as Mr. Neal addressed the two factors the judgeidentified as central in bail determination: risk of flightand the seriousness of the offense.   Mr. Neal said Mr. Keating &quot;has never failed to appear atany hearing or interview he was scheduled for&quot; in thenumerous inquiries since Lincoln's seizure by federalregulators. He also noted lower &quot;presumptive bail&quot; amountsthat the court recommends for violent crimes-$50,000, forexample, in a kidnapping with intent to commit a sexualoffense and $10,000 in terrorism cases.   Mr. Neal, who later told reporters he planned to appeal,said in court that a debt-laden Mr. Keating could post bailof only $500,000 if several family members encumbered theirhouses and other assets. Financial records were producedshowing a net worth of $40 million in 1987, when his AmericanContinental compensation was about $3 million and he was alarge political contributor. But most assets listed were innow-worthless American Continental stock.   Prosecutors, in their questioning, have hinted that Mr.Keating is hiding assets accumulated during the five yearsAmerican Continental owned Lincoln. They noted that in rulingagainst Mr. Keating's own suit challenging the thrift'sseizure, a federal judge said transfers of funds to AmericanContinental &quot;amounted to a looting of Lincoln.&quot;   After the judge reduced bail to $200,000 for AmericanContinental's former president, Judy E. Wischer, and to$100,000 for former Lincoln presidents Robin S. Symes and RayC. Fidel, the three posted bail and were released. Mr. Reinersaid he expects the trial of the four, who each face maximumsentences of 10 years in prison and fines of $10,000, tobegin before year end.</TEXT></DOC>
