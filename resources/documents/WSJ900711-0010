Mitchell Kapor, creator of the single most popular programfor PCs, 1-2-3, and founder of Lotus Development Corp.,yesterday unveiled the Electronic Frontier Foundation, whichis being underwritten by Mr. Kapor and Steve Wozniak,cofounder of Apple Computer Inc. The group will assist in thelegal defense of hackers accused of crimes and will researchlegal issues involving computer communications.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Kapor began his campaign on behalf of hackers in lateMay, but with the exception of Mr. Wozniak, who no longer hasan active role in the industry, he has been unable to gainbroad support in the computer world. So far, many of theindustry's biggest names have decided against wading into thecontroversy, including wealthy ex-hacker William Gates, nowchairman of Microsoft Corp. He considers the legal issues toomurky.   Mr. Kapor's defense of hackers -- who use their knowledgeof the intricacies of computer networks to enter, or &quot;hack,&quot;forbidden databases -- comes in the wake of a series ofinvestigations into computer crime this year by the SecretService, which enforces federal laws in this area. Thebiggest investigation, dubbed Operation Sun Devil, led to aMay 8 raid that resulted in five arrests and the seizure of40 computers and 23,000 data-storage disks in 14 cities.   Mr. Kapor contends that the government's crackdownthreatens the rights of computer users and may stiflecreativity, saying that some teen hackers are going to become&quot;the technological innovators of tomorrow.&quot; Some prosecutorsdisagree. Mr. Kapor's attitude is that &quot;there's somethingholy and sacred about computers that exempts those who usethem from ordinary rules,&quot; said Gail Thackeray, an attorneywith the state of Arizona.   Far from oppressing the inquisitive, the Secret Servicesays it is simply cracking down on people who exploitloopholes in computer security to steal credit card numbersand charge thousands of dollars of goods and telephoneservices. &quot;These people are not the Lewis and Clarks of the21st century,&quot; said Dale Boll, who runs the Secret Service'sfraud division.   Mr. Boll said that, among other things, the Secret Serviceuncovered a plot to disrupt emergency telephone service innine states through the introduction of a virus, ordisruptive software program, into the computer system ofBellSouth Corp.   On Monday, three men -- said to be members of the Legionof Doom, a loose association of about two dozen hackers fromaround the country -- pleaded guilty in Atlanta to stealingsoftware and access codes from BellSouth. Ironically, the mengained entry into BellSouth's sophisticated computer networkusing an old-fashioned method: they found a telephone numberfor a central computer in a company trash bin.   Despite the guilty pleas, the government is coming underfire for failing to bring its cases to court more quickly.Mr. Boll says it will be months before the government evenseeks indictments stemming from its May raids because theSecret Service still must sift through huge amounts ofelectronic evidence.   The delays frustrate people caught up in the May 8 raids,some of whom vigorously protest their innocence. SteveJackson, who runs a games company in Austin, Texas, sawSecret Service agents seize several personal computers andbusiness information on May 8, including the manuscript for afantasy game called &quot;cyberpunk,&quot;in which hackers wield powerthrough computers. It was six weeks before Mr. Jackson gothis equipment back, but by then the disruption had forced himto lay off eight of his 17 employees, he said.   Mr. Jackson said he has never received an adequateexplanation of why his company was searched. The SecretService said the company was targeted because one of Mr.Jackson's employees was being investigated.   Also troubling to Mr. Kapor is the closure of acomputerized bulletin board run by a University of Missouristudent, who was indicted in February on several counts ofinterstate wire fraud and transportation of stolen property.   Mr. Kapor contends the closure of the bulletin boardamounts to a restraint on free speech, but the governmentasserts that the student knowingly distributed stoleninformation using the bulletin board.   ---   John R.
