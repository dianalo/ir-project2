DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Record-keeping methods that would allowinvestigators to reconstruct trades on the nation's commoditiesexchanges are ``fundamentally inadequate,'' a Senate committee wastold today.   But officials of the General Accounting Office saidcomputerization doesn't necessarily spell the end of the historicalhurly-burly method of trading by shouts and hand signals known asopen outcry.   ``I think that's a question the exchanges themselves need toanswer,'' said Richard L. Fogel, an assistant comptroller generalwith the GAO, the auditing arm of Congress.   ``I don't personally believe that the government should dictatehow the exchanges want to trade,'' he added.   Fogel was testifying before the Senate Committee on Agriculture,Nutrition and Forestry about a study of the methods used byexchanges to track trading and keep futures traders honest.Questions about trading practices have emerged in the aftermath ofalleged fraud in Chicago's commodity pits.   The study found exchange systems for tracking a given trade,known as an ``audit trail,'' lacking because so much of the recordkeeping is left to the traders and brokers themselves.   Sen. Patrick Leahy asked Fogel if he believed the ``current audittrail systems in place at the major U.S. exchanges are fundamentallyinadequate to police the trading floors against abuses?''   ``I think it is. Yes,'' said Fogel, noting that there is noguarantee that information about the timing of when an order gets toa broker and when the order is executed by the broker.   Earlier, Leahy, the committee's chairman noted that ``the publicis not adequately protected. Audit trails are the backbone of thefloor policing systems; they must be improved substantially beforewe can guarantee the integrity of the trading pits.''   Forty-five traders at the Chicago Board of Trade and the ChicagoMercantile Exchange were charged Aug. 2 with bilking profits fromhundreds of customers through a series of illegal activities,including falsified trading records.   ``While detecting every abuse may never be possible, most of thetypes of abuses alleged in the Justice Department indictments couldalso have been detected and documented with independent, precise andcomplete timing of trades,'' said a report by the General AccountingOffice, the watchdog arm of Congress.   At issue is the ``audit trail,'' a term describing the process ofdetermining who bought what from whom and when they did it. In otherwords, the ability to reconstruct precisely any given transaction.   The two futures exchanges, the largest in the world, have beencriticized for not keeping a closer watch on traders, while theCommodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the futuresmarkets, has been accused of doing so with too light a touch.   ``Although improvements in the audit trail system would aid inthe detection of the kind of abuses we've seen in Chicago,'' said aCFTC spokeswoman Thursday evening, ``if you're going to identify andprosecute this kind of activity you're also going to need the kindof undercover observation and surveillance we had.''   The CFTC is up for reauthorization this fall and areauthorization bill passed by the House would require exchanges toreconstruct a trade to within one minute of its occurence, no laterthan one year after the bill becomes law.   Audit trails accurate to the nearest 30 seconds would be requiredwithin three years of the bill's enactment.   Within weeks of the indictments, the two Chicago exchangesannounced they were developing hand-held computer terminals torecord floor trading.   But the GAO study said the CFTC has ``not been actively involvedin conducting or setting guidelines for technical assessments ofthese systems' capabilities to control trading abuses and automationrisks.''   The GAO also said the CFTC lacks ``the necessary technicalresources'' to keep tabs on the exchanges' developing technology.   The Senate requested the GAO study in March.</TEXT></DOC>
