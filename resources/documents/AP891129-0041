Anistreplase, the third clot-dissolving drug to be approved, canbe administered in five minutes or less while the other two drugsmust be administered continuously for one to three hours, saidSmithKline Beecham, which will market the drug as Eminase.   Clot-dissolving drugs can open blocked arteries and limit damagefrom heart attacks, but are used in only about 20 percent of theestimated 400,000 to 600,000 patients who could benefit fromtreatment each year, the Department of Health and Human Servicessaid Tuesday.   More than 300,000 of the 1.5 million people who suffer heartattacks each year die before getting to the hospital and anadditional 300,000 get there too late for treatment withclot-dissolving drugs, the department said in announcing the FDAaction.   A blood clot blocking one of the arteries to the heart is themost common cause of heart attacks. The clot prevents blood fromcarrying oxygen to the heart muscle, which can lead to heartfailure and death.   The other two approved clot-dissolving drugs are alteplase, orTPA, and streptokinase.</TEXT><NOTE>Judge Denies Hinckley Request for News Interviews</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Presidential assailant John Hinckley won't beallowed to be interviewed by news organizations, a judge ruled,saying Hinckley's mental illness could worsen with public exposure.   U.S. District Court Judge June Green on Tuesday rejectedHinckley's request for up to two interviews per month with the newsmedia.   A directive at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington prohibitingpersonal interviews between maximum-security patients and the newsmedia ``embodies a reasonable and constitutionally valid'' approachwith regard to Hinckley, Green said.   The directive, the judge noted, permits patients to correspondwith reporters by mail. Hinckley has done so in the past.   Hinckley, found not guilty by reason of insanity in the March1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan, has been a patientat St. Elizabeths since August 1982. Three months ago, he filed amotion saying his First Amendment right of free speech was beingviolated.   Hinckley's attorney, Mark Lane, said he would consult with hisclient before deciding whether to appeal.   White House press secretary James Brady was left partiallyparalyzed in the 1981 shootings, in which a Secret Service agentand Washington police officer were wounded as well as the president.</TEXT><NOTE>FBI to Begin Random Drug Testing of Employees Soon</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   FBI Director William S. Sessions says randomtesting for possible use of illegal drugs by employees may beginearly next year.   Sessions told the bureau's 9,700 agents and nearly 13,000support personnel of the random testing program in a notice datedNov. 14, FBI spokesman Mike Kortan said Tuesday.   The random testing is expected to begin after Jan. 14, Kortansaid.   A computer program will be used to randomly select the names ofemployees who will be required to undergo urine testing todetermine if they have used illegal drugs, Kortan said.   Employees who test positive could be suspended or dismissed, but``each case would be evaluated individually,'' Kortan said.   Refusal to provide a urine sample would also result indisciplinary action that could include dismissal, he said.   The random testing is being started under a 1986 executive orderby President Reagan. A number of federal agencies have institutedsimilar programs, which have met with mixed reviews in courtdecisions resulting from lawsuits filed by affected employees.</TEXT></DOC>
