A preliminary report by the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the dominant trade group of savings-and-loan associations, also found that adjustable-rate mortgage borrowers tend to be older, have higher incomes and buy more expensive homes than fixed-rate borrowers. The report said that adjustable-rate loans account for two-thirds of all home loans made by Sandamp;Ls, and 83% of those issued by savings banks.    The U.S. League issued the report over the weekend, on the eve of its annual convention here.    With fixed-rate loans, &quot;you are buying an insurance policy against a rate change and right now that insurance policy is very expensive,&quot; said Dennis J. Jacobe, research director for the U.S. League.    The report based its demographic findings on a survey of more than 22,000 conventional loans made in the 1987 second quarter.    Data on interest savings was based on a comparison of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans reaching back to early 1981. The savings were calculated on interest paid through September 1987. The rate comparison was between average fixed rate data collected monthly by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and adjustable rates based on one-year, constant maturity Treasury bills plus a 2.25% percentage point margin, or the cost-of-funds index reported by the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks plus an identical margin. These two indexes account for about 60% of all adjustable-rate loans, the report said. </TEXT></DOC>
