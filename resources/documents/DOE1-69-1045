The three video monitors (touchpanel, colorgraphics display and terminal screen) of the original SLC console arereplaced by four windows on the single workstation monitor, and standalonediagnostic programs may run concurrently. In order to minimize softwareeffort and operator training, it was a design requirement that higher-levelcontrol and applications code, particularly that in the SLC Control Program,be identical whether the program executed on the MicroVAX or on the hostVAX. The code for the graphics is necessarily different for the MicroVAX,as is the lower-level code used to access resources resident only inthe host. A server program on the host acts as intermediary between programsrunning on the workstation and these resources.</TEXT></DOC>
