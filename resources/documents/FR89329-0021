Thenotice was a result of an internal agency review of its regulations andwas intended to improve the efficiency of the proceedings, or, in somecases, to conform with changes in U.S. law. 53 FR 43902. The public was invited to submit comments to the Tribunal by December 15,1988. The Tribunal received comments from the following organizations:the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), BroadcastMusic, Inc. (BMI), the Joint Sports Claimants (composed of Major LeagueBaseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey Leagueand the National Collegiate Athletic Association), the Motion Picture Associationof America, Inc. (MPAA), the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB),the National Cable Television Association (NCTA), the National Music PublishersAssociation (NMPA), National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public BroadcastingService (PBS). In general, the comments supported the changes proposed by the Tribunal.In particular, there were many comments of a technical nature which expressedconcern about the actual wording of some of the proposed regulations, andin most cases the commenters offered substitute language which would takecare of their concerns. The final disposition of the Tribunal's proposedchanges are as follows: <T3>Sections 301.7, 301.14, 301.22. </T3>Adopted as proposed. <T3>Section 301.44(a). </T3>The Tribunal agrees with the concerns expressedby PBS regarding the second sentence of andSection; 301.44(a) as proposed,and has deleted it. That sentence was not intended to create two levelsof participation in Tribunal proceedings, but was simply a transfer ofthe language in the current andSection; 301.52 to the new andSection; 301.44.As PBS points out, the new placement of the language could create uncertainty.We agree with PBS that the Tribunal can deal with the specific facts andcircumstances of a late-filed notice of intent or a request to participateoutside of the rules on an <T3>ad hoc </T3>basis. <T3>Section 301.44(b). </T3>The Tribunal agrees with NAB's editorial commentand has inserted the word ``direct'' prior to the last word of the sentence.<T3>Section 301.44(c). </T3>Adopted as proposed. <T3>Section 301.44(d). </T3>The Tribunal agrees with PBS' comment thatpercentage claims or requested rates should be permitted to be revisedonly up to the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and notup to the reply proposed findings, and has made the appropriate change.<T3>Section 301.44(e). </T3>The Tribunal agrees with NPR's comment thatadministrative flexibility should be provided for in this section and hasadded, ``or for good cause shown.'' <T3>Section 301.44(f). </T3>Adopted as proposed. The Tribunal believesthat the concerns of PBS and Joint Sports are not warranted. The phrase``Unless otherwise structured by the Tribunal,'' which PBS fears is intendedto limit opportunity for rebuttal, is only intended to modify the phrase``in the same form and manner as the direct case,'' so that the Tribunalmay ask for rebuttal cases in a different form or manner than the directcase. It is not intended to state that the Tribunal will not have a rebuttalphase in its proceedings. We agree with NPR's reply to Joint Sports that whether the rebuttal caseproperly rebuts the direct cases can be handled by objections at the propertime. <T3>Section 301.45 (a) and (b).</T3> Adopted as proposed. <T3>Section 301.45(c). </T3>The Tribunal agrees with NPR's comment thata declaration made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1746 would be as equally validas an affidavit in Tribunal proceedings, and has made the appropriate change.<T3>Section 301.45(d). </T3>The Tribunal has corrected the typographicalerrors which were noted by ASCAP, BMI, NPR and PBS. <T3>Section 301.45(e). </T3>The Tribunal agrees with NAB's comment thatin cases where response time is short, service by first-class mail hasbeen insufficient. We have added a sentence which will require such serviceto be by means no slower than overnight express mail. This is intendedto include all the other faster means of delivery such as hand delivery,telecopy, or facsimile transmission. <T3>Section 301.46(a). </T3>Adopted as proposed. <T3>Section 301.46(b). </T3>To cure the possible uncertainty between proposedandSection; 301.46(b) and proposed andSection; 301.48(f), as noted by NPR,the Tribunal has added the language suggested by NPR. <T3>Section 301.46(c). </T3>BMI expressed concern that this section doesnot provide for discovery for amendments to the written case, and NAB expressedconcern that this section would disallow amending the written case forfactual correction or typographical errors. The section has been modifiedto take care of their concerns. <T3>Section 301.47 (a) and (b). </T3>Adopted as proposed. <T3>Section 301.47(c). </T3>ASCAP believed that the provision concerningthe case where two Commissioners are sitting should be expanded to includewhenever an even number of Commissioners are sitting. The Tribunal agreesand has modified the section. The Tribunal does not agree with the commentoffered by BMI that the words ``or overrule'' should be added to the section,because that would defeat our intended meaning. The Tribunal has addedanother sentence to the section to make clear that it would not take amajority vote to overrule an objection, only a split vote. However, theTribunal agrees with BMI that andSection; 301.47(c)(6) is redundant and unnecessaryand has deleted it. <T3>Section 301.47(d). </T3>The Tribunal agrees with BMI's proposed modificationand has implemented it. The Tribunal disagrees with Joint Sports that andSection;301.47(d) implies that the Tribunal has subpoena powers. <T3>Section 301.48(a). </T3>Adopted as proposed. <T3>Section 301.48(b). </T3>Comments filed by PBS demonstrated that thewording of andSection; 301.48(b) was ambiguous. It has been re-worded toclarify its meaning. <T3>Section 301.48 (c) and (d). </T3>Adopted as proposed. <T3>Section 301.48(e). </T3>Joints Sports' comment that referring to the``scope'' of the witness' written testimony might allow too much leewayto introduce facts not included in the written case is well-taken. Thelanguage Joints Sports proposed has been adopted. <T3>Section 301.48(f). </T3>The Tribunal has followed NPR's suggestionto clarify the relationship between andSection;andSection; 301.46(b) and 301.48(f).This action should take care of the concerns of BMI and NAB which werequite similar to NPR's concern.<T3>Section 301.48 (g), (h) and (i). </T3>Adopted as proposed. <T3>Section 301.48(j). </T3>NPR commented that this section might act torestrict the discretion of the Tribunal to expand the scope of the questionsthe Tribunal could itself raise of the witness on cross-examination. WhileandSection; 301.47(d) already states that a Commissioner may examine anywitness at any time, another sentence has been added to state again thatthe Tribunal retains full discretion on cross-examination. NAB commentedthat cross-examination should be allowed of the witness' direct case, aswell as the witness' direct testimony. The Tribunal intended the phrase``matters raised on direct examination'' to include the direct case, sothat NAB's suggested amendment is unnecessary. <T3>Section 301.48(k). </T3>The Tribunal accepts NAB's recommendation toadd the phrase ``prior to being shown to the witness'' to this section.<T3>Section 301.48(l). </T3>BMI, NMPA, and NPR expressed concerns aboutthe mandatory nature of this section. The Tribunal has made modifications,accordingly. <T3>Sections 301.49 through 301.55. </T3>Adopted as proposed. <T3>Sections 301.63 and 301.64. </T3>Adopted as proposed. At NCTA requests,the Tribunal wishes to make clear that this change is not intended in anyway to limit or supersede the twelve month period prescribed by the CopyrightAct for filing petitions for rate adjustments during the ``window'' yearsapplicable for cable, mechanical and jukebox. <T3>Sections 301.66 and 301.74. </T3>Adopted as proposed. NPR and PBS tookopposite views on this proposed change. NPR believed that it was necessaryfor the Tribunal to publish proposed determinations. PBS believed thateven making the publication of proposed determinations an option for theTribunal was unnecessary, because the additional administrative hearingssuch a publication might engender would rarely prove useful. ASCAP supportedthe rule change as written. The Tribunal has decided to make the publishingof proposed determinations optional, as proposed. <T3>Sections 301.70, 302.1, 302.10 and 308.2. </T3>Adopted as proposed.<T3>Sections 301.80, 301.81, 301.82, and 301.83. </T3>Adopted as proposed.<T3>Sections 302.2, 302.3 and 302.6. </T3>Adopted as proposed. <T3>Section 302.7. </T3>BMI suggested that if the Tribunal wants to makethe regulations for the filing of claims in both jukebox and cable consistent,the provision from the jukebox regulation allowing performing rights societiesto file without a separate authorization from its members or affiliatesshould be included in the cable regulation as well. The Tribunal agreesand has made the appropriate modification. <T3>Section 302.8. </T3>ASCAP supported this proposed rule change, BMI,NAB and PBS thought that the change made the rule too restrictive, andthe other commenters expressed no opinion. The Tribunal does not believethat our insistence that either a claim be received in our office duringJuly or that it bear a July U.S. postmark is too restrictive. The claimitself is easy to prepare. No government forms are necessary. The informationthat is required can be put on one page. Further, the claimant has sixmonths from the close of the calendar year to prepare it, and the entiremonth of July to submit it to the Tribunal. Our proposed rule providesa bright line test which should end all questions of fact regarding thetimeliness of the claim. The Tribunal adopts the section as proposed, exceptthat the word ``only'' is added at ASCAP's suggestion. <T3>Section 305.2. </T3>The Tribunal has inserted the word ``year.'' Itsomission was a typographical error spotted by BMI. <T3>Section 305.3. </T3>The Tribunal has decided not to delete paragraph(c). ASCAP was correct when they observed that the provision is requiredby Section 116 of the Copyright Act. <T3>Section 305.4. </T3>Adopted as proposed, except for the insertion ofthe word ``only,'' as ASCAP suggested. The Tribunal has decided not toreconsider its decision not to require the claimant to identify itselfas a performing rights society or as a copyright owner. That informationcan be obtained at a later date in the proceeding. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>37 CFR Part 301 Administrative practice and procedure, Freedom of information, SunshineAct. 37 CFR Part 302 Cable television, Claims, Copyright. 37 CFR Part 305 Claims, Copyright, Jukeboxes. 37 CFR Part 308 Cable television, Copyright, Rates.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Tribunal amends 37 CFR Part301 as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 301_COPYRIGHT ROYALTY TRIBUNAL RULES OF PROCEDURE </ITAG>1.

Section 301.22 is revised as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 301.22</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Public access. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Requesting information. </T3>Information may be requested from theTribunal in person, by telephone, or by mail. If the material sought isnot a Tribunal record, is exempted, or for some reason is unavailable,the person requesting it will be so informed and, in the case of an ``exemptedrecord,'' will be explained the reason for the exemption and the procedurefor appeal under the Freedom of Information Act, andSection; 301.13. (b) <T3>Fees. </T3>Fees for copies of Tribunal records are $.20 per page; $20for each hour or fraction thereof spent searching for records; $5 for certificationof each document; and the actual costs to the Tribunal for any other costsincurred. (c) <T3>Imposition of fees. </T3>(1) Commercial use requests_Where a requestappears to seek disclosure of records for a commercial use, the requestershall be charged for the time spent by Tribunal personnel in searchingfor the requested document and in reviewing the record to determine whetherit should be disclosed, and for the cost of each page of duplication. ``Commercialuse'' is defined as a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, tradeor profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf therequest in made. Commercial users include all claimants or petitionersfor rate adjustments whose interest in the information is to further theircase preparation before the Tribunal. (2) Requests from representatives of news media_Where a request seeks disclosureof records to a representative of the news media, the requester shall becharged only for the actual duplication cost of the records and only tothe extent that the number of duplications exceeds 100 pages; providedthat the request must reasonably describe the records sought, and it mustappear that the records are for use by the requester in such person's capacityas a news media representative. ``Representative of the news media'' refersto any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized andoperated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news''means information that is about current events or that would be of currentinterest to the public. A ``freelance'' journalist not actually employedby a news organization shall be eligible for inclusion under this categoryif such person can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publicationby a news organization. (3) Requests from educational and noncommercial scientific institutions_Wherea request seeks disclosure of records to an educational or noncommercialscientific institution, the requester shall be charged only for the actualduplication cost of the records and only to the extent that the numberof duplications exceeds 100 pages; provided, however, that the requestmust reasonably describe the records sought and it must appear that therecords are to be used by the requester in furtherance of its educationalor noncommercial scientific research programs. To that extent, educationalor noncommercial scientific institutions which are claimants or petitionersbefore the agency are considered ``commercial users.'' ``Educational institution''refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school,or an institution of undergraduate, graduate, professional or vocationaleducation which operates a program or programs of scholarly research. ``Noncommercialscientific institution'' refers to an institution that is operated solelyfor the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of whichare not intended to promote any particular products or industry. (4) All other requests_Where a request seeks disclosure of records to aperson or entity other than paragraphs (c) (1), (2), or (3) of this section,the requester shall be charged the full cost of search and duplication.However, the first two hours of search time and the first 100 pages ofduplication shall be furnished without charge. (d) <T3>Aggregating of requests. </T3>If there exists a substantial basis forconcluding that a requester or group of requesters has submitted a seriesof partial requests for disclosure of records in an attempt to evade assessmentof fees, the requests may be aggregated so as to constitute a single request,with fees charged accordingly. (e) <T3>Interest. </T3>In the event a requester fails to remit payment of feescharged for processing a request within 30 days from the date such feeswere billed, interest on such fees may be assessed beginning on the 31stday after the billing date, to be calculated at the rate prescribed insection 3717 of Title 31, United States Code. (f) <T3>Advance payments. </T3>If, but only if, it is estimated or determinedthat processing of a request for disclosure of records will result in acharge of fees of more than $250, the requester may be required to paythe fees in advance. If a requester has previously failed to make timelypayment of fees, the requester may be required to pay such fees and interestaccrued thereon, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of estimatedfees chargeable in connection with any pending or new request. (g) <T3>Nonpayment. </T3>In the event of nonpayment of billed charges for disclosureof records, the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, includingdisclosure to consumer credit reporting agencies and referral to collectionagencies, may be utilized to obtain payment. (h) <T3>Waiver or reduction of charges. </T3>The Tribunal shall waive the fee,or grant a fee reduction, if disclosure of the information is in the publicinterest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understandingof the operations or activities of the government, and is not primarilyin the commercial interest of the requester. The Tribunal will not chargeif the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee is likelyto equal or exceed the amount of the fee. However, the Tribunal has determinedthat the cost of writing up the invoice and transmitting the fees to theTreasury Department is <T3>de minimis </T3>and is not a basis for not collecting a fee. 5.

However, copies of such documents must be distributedto the Tribunal and to other participants or their counsel at hearing priorto being shown to the witness at the time of cross-examination, unlessthe Tribunal directs otherwise. If the document is not, or will not be,supported by a witness for the cross-examining party, that document canbe used solely to impeach the witness' direct testimony and cannot itselfbe relied upon in findings of fact as rebutting the witness' direct testimony.However, upon leave from the Tribunal, the document can be admitted asevidence without a sponsoring witness if official notice is proper, orif in the Tribunal's view, the cross-examined witness is the proper sponsoringwitness.
