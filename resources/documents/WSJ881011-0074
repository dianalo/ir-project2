The chain also said it is seeking at least $65 million in punitive damages.    Furr's/Bishop's charges in the suit that two of its former employees who now work for Furr's, a Lubbock-based grocery chain, have disclosed trade secrets and some of its recipes, which allegedly are being used in cafeterias Furr's has opened.    The two companies originally were part of a family-owned business, but were split and later sold.    Furr's/Bishop's also charges that its competitor is trying to destroy its business and has hired five of its management and 16 of its hourly employees in an effort to imitate Furr's/Bishop's products.    Also named in the suit are the two employees, Furr's officers and Supermarket Development Corp., Furr's parent. None of the defendants could be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
