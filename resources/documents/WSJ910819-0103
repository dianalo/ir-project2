The company paid $750 million for White ConsolidatedIndustries Inc. and quickly began overhauling White's rundownmanufacturing facilities, much as it had done with dozens ofailing appliance producers in Europe. Electrolux promised itsturnaround efforts would enable White's pretax profit totriple to $150 million in three years.</LP><TEXT>   It appears Electrolux didn't succeed. The Swedish companydoesn't disclose White's earnings, but lower profits from theU.S. are the main reason why Electrolux logged a string ofprofit declines; earnings sank 41% in 1989, 61% in 1990 and14% in the first quarter this year from the year-earlierperiod.   Last week, Electrolux said its pretax profit for the firsthalf fell 9.3% to 917 million kronor ($US144.2 million) from1.01 billion kronor a year earlier. Sales declined 6.6% to40.77 billion kronor from 43.64 billion kronor. Profit didedge up narrowly in the second quarter, which began withstronger sales. But sales weakened again by the end of theperiod, the company said, adding that &quot;there have been nodefinite signs of an upswing in business conditions&quot; in itsmajor markets.   And while Electrolux's profit growth has cooled, globalcompetition has heated up. The three biggest U.S.-basedappliance makers have turned the tables on Electrolux bycharging into Europe through acquisitions. Whirlpool Corp.displaced Electrolux as world market leader by gobbling upPhilips Electronics N.V.'s European appliance division.Whirlpool also is generally considered the No. 1 brand in theU.S., followed by General Electric Co. and Electrolux, butElextrolux remains No. 1 in Europe, followed by Whirlpool andGermany's Siemens A.G.   A Whirlpool executive based in Italy says his company'sfirst-half sales in Europe jumped nearly 10% from the yearearlier, exceeding the 1% rise in overall European applianceshipments for the period. Profit margins in Europe alsoincreased, the executive says, but he didn't provide details.   Some of this likely came at the expense of Electrolux,which is unaccustomed to finding bigger rivals in its ownback yard. And Whirlpool plans to step up the pressure withaggressive moves, such as a three-year, $100 millionadvertising blitz to make it better known across Europe.   Naturally, Electrolux is fighting back, and few industryanalysts expect Whirlpool to threaten the company's No. 1ranking in Europe any time soon. Yet the European Community's1992 single market plan will make it easier for U.S.challengers to establish pan-European brands anddistribution, analysts suggest. And before long, they add,fierce price competition could make profit margins in Europeas thin as those in the U.S.   That scenario makes rapid recovery in the U.S. even moreimportant. It's Electrolux's biggest single market andaccounts for about one-third of total appliance sales. Butrecovery could be elusive.   To be sure, there are signs the deep U.S. economicdownturn may be ending. Major U.S. appliance producersreported second-quarter earnings that were slightly betterthan expected.   Whirlpool Chairman David R. Whitwam expects U.S. applianceshipments to revive in the second half, reducing thefull-year decline to about 5%, compared with an 11% dropduring the first half. Whirlpool anticipates a 6% increase inshipments next year, the first growth since 1987.   Nevertheless, it could be a while before effects of a U.S.market upturn flow through to Electrolux's bottom line. Atough austerity program has been launched at White to slashoverhead. And three new appliance factories promise to boostproductivity and shrink unit costs well below those ofWhite's older plants. The cost-cutting drive will eliminate8,000 jobs, roughly 25% of the White's work force in theU.S., by year end.   But Electrolux lost significant U.S. market share toWhirlpool and GE (no relation to Britain's General ElectricCo.) during bitter price wars the past two years. Regainingthat lost ground will be tricky, and might offset much ofElectrolux's progress in slashing costs.   &quot;The surest way to regain market share is through pricecompetition. That's something Electrolux has to do to filltheir U.S. factories,&quot; says Martin Sankey, a New York-basedappliance analyst for First Boston Corp. &quot;But the process ofwinning back those market shares might be costly as well.Their income statements for U.S. operations the next coupleof years aren't going to be a lot of fun to read.&quot;   In a surprise management shake-up earlier this year,Electrolux installed as White's new president Hans Baeckman,a 55-year-old executive who headed its outdoor productsdivision. He is the first Swede dispatched to run U.S.appliance operations, even though he lacks direct applianceindustry experience.   Senior Electrolux executives acknowledge the shufflereflects a relatively bleak view of U.S. prospects. When aveteran White executive was named president two years ago,&quot;we expected a stable market and strong customer confidence,&quot;says Electrolux Chairman Anders Scharp.   Now, facing dismal markets and internal problems, &quot;wedecided we needed a tough and raw new U.S. chief,&quot; he adds.&quot;Mr. Baeckman is an executive you can depend on in this kindof a situation.&quot;   As part of the new look, Electrolux also changed White'sname to Frigidaire Co. (In the late 1970s, White acquired theformer General Motors Corp. appliance division of that name.)The change underscores aggressive plans to repositionFrigidaire as Electrolux's top-of-the-line brand, targeted atupscale U.S. consumers.   Mr. Baeckman's orders include completing the consolidationof far-flung White operations inherited by Electrolux. Seniorexecutives in Stockholm grumble that American managersweren't tough enough in streamlining the company.   Other management gaffes accelerated White's profit plunge.Construction snags at the new appliance plants forcedElectrolux to continue parallel production at older factoriesduring much of the past two years. That alone cost anestimated 400 million Swedish kronor, or 25% of theoriginally projected 1.6 billion-kronor investment in thethree new U.S. factories.   And in mid-1989, with profit margins rapidly waning, Whitemanagement raised prices, hoping its rivals would followsuit. They didn't. White rescinded the increases after acouple of months, but has had to offer aggressive discountsever since to win back lost market share.   That pricing flap underscores the limitations andfrustrations for Electrolux as a relatively weak No. 3 amongU.S. appliance makers. &quot;Like some U.S. companies moving intoEurope, Electrolux seems to have underestimated thedoggedness of local entrenched players,&quot; says Dennis Exton, aLondon-based analyst for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;To be a pricetrendsetter, you have to have strong brand visibility andacceptance to back it up. White isn't there yet, and is goingto have to remain a follower of Whirlpool and GE.&quot;   Mr. Scharp admits that &quot;thanks to their size, GE andWhirlpool can do to us in the U.S. what we do as marketleader in Europe.&quot; He insists the company &quot;still thinks wecan make a lot of money in the U.S. We have to stay there andcontinue concentrating on ways to improve.&quot; Still, he adds:&quot;There are no immediate ways of changing our marketposition.&quot;   Moving the Frigidaire brand further upmarket is animportant part of the turnaround strategy. Top-of-the-lineappliances are expected to enjoy a higher rate of salesgrowth than mass brands or discount products, industryanalysts say.   But changing a brand's established image isn't easy. Mr.Exton, the Merrill Lynch analyst, thinks Electrolux &quot;might betrying to position Frigidaire too high from its roots as adefinite middle brand.&quot; By contrast, Whirlpool, respectedthroughout the appliance industry for its brand managementprowess, opted to acquire an established premium brand --KitchenAid -- rather than tinker with the market position ofits Whirlpool name.   Electrolux expects its European design skills to helpupgrade the new premium products. Transforming the Frigidairebrand also could create an opening for new Europeantechnology, company executives say. For example, Electroluxhopes to improve White's washing machines by outfitting newmodels with technology developed by Italian unit Zanussi. Themodels require less water and energy than existing U.S.machines.   But it will take time and plenty of expensive advertisingto get the Frigidaire message across. &quot;We're trying to makeour American products distinctive by giving them a technologyprofile they previously lacked,&quot; says Mr. Scharp. &quot;But it'shard to sell products on the basis of technology andperformance with the U.S. market in its current state.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
