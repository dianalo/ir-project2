Terms weren't disclosed. But the companies said that aspart of the agreement, they will provide Teleport with anadditional $80 million for expansion.</LP><TEXT>   The sale gives Cox a foothold in the business of operatingfiber-optic networks, which are popular with corporations andother large organizations with heavy telephone needs and anaversion to depending on a single phone service. Someindustry analysts and executives speculate that fiber-opticnetworks -- which transmit voice and data -- may soon be ableto transmit television signals, opening new markets for themedia industry.   &quot;Cable operators are looking for a final link to thehome,&quot; said Kenneth Leon, an analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.&quot;Teleport gives Cox entry into telecommunications and achance to {become} a low-cost provider of these services.&quot;   William L. Killen Jr., vice president at Cox, said thecompany wants to be involved in an &quot;emerging and growing&quot;industry. &quot;We're interested in remaining `state of the art'in all of our businesses, and to the extent that includesputting fiber optic into cable television, that's aninterest&quot; to Cox, he said. Based in Atlanta, Cox hasinterests in 24 cable-TV systems, 21 TV and radio stationsand 17 daily newspapers.   Merrill had been seeking a partner for several months.   Teleport's prospects were boosted by a recent FederalCommunications Commission proposal on fiber-optic linkupswith local phone systems. The proposal would allowfiber-optic companies to connect their networks to phonesystems run by the regional Bell companies and GTE Corp. forinterstate services. Under the proposal, competitors of theBells and GTE would be allowed to monitor and control theirown circuits, and the local phone companies would be requiredto make certain equipment available to the competitors.   The FCC's proposal is initially limited to private-lineservices that corporations could use to connect branchoffices or other buildings. The commission also isconsidering allowing alternative-network companies to pluginto local phone networks to tap into services that connectcalls to a subscriber's line.   Cox is the latest media company to show an interest in thetelecommunications field as a way to boost revenue andcounter future competition from local phone companies. Lastmonth, Philadelphia-based Comcast Corp., a cable-TV concern,agreed to purchase the Philadelphia cellular operations ofMetromedia Co., Secaucus, N.J., for $1.1 billion in a plan toeventually acquire Metromedia.   Separately, Teleport said its Dallas unit agreed to buythe assets of DFW/Metrolink, a Dallas provider of localfiber-optic telecommunication services that filed forliquidation this year under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.</TEXT></DOC>
