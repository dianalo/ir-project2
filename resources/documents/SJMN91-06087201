Funding for the military in the 1990 budget wasincreased sharply, apparently to reward the army's suppression ofpro-democracy protests in June 1989.;    Wang, in his annual budget message tothe National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp legislature, said themilitary increase was needed &quot;to keep abreast of the complex and volatileinternational situation&quot; and would be used mainly to modernize weapons andequipment.;    The success of U.S. weapons and technology in the Persian Gulfwar added to calls within the Chinese military for increased funding, Chinesesources said. China, a major supplier of weapons to the Middle East, saw someof that hardware devastated by the allies.;    At a meeting shortly after thecease-fire in the gulf, all three services here concluded that the decisivefactor leading to the coalition victory was the superiority of the allies'weapons, one Chinese source said.;    In his budget message, Wang painted ableak picture of the country's finances. &quot;We are faced with an extremely grimsituation and an arduous task,&quot; he said.;    Nearly one-third of centralgovernment revenues were used to bail out failing state-owned enterprises lastyear, and a slightly smaller amount -- $10.7 billion -- has been set aside forthat purpose this year, he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Beijing  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910327  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  293  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 27, 199100087201,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
