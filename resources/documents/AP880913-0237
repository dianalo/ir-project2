Kohlberg Kravis' $85-a-share cash and securities acquisition, ifsuccessful, would conclude Macmillan's struggle to thwart unwelcometakeover attempts by Maxwell and Texas investor Robert Bass.   David Bonderman, an official at the Bass group's headquarters inFort Worth, Texas, declined to comment. Andrew Turner, a spokesmanfor Maxwell at his Oxford, England offices, said, ``We've receivedthis report and are studying it.''   Wall Street reacted skeptically to whether a higher offer wouldemerge. Macmillan stock rose 87{ cents a share to $84.75 in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading on Monday.   Analysts were divided on Maxwell's next move. While some thoughthe would abandon his pursuit of the company, others said he couldincrease the bid, because his $84-a-share offer was so close toKohlberg's $85.   ``I would not be surprised if we would see more from Maxwell,''said Bruce Thorp, who follows the publishing industry for ProvidentNational Bank in Philadelphia. ``You might be able to make theargument that his all-cash of $84 is more attractive. If so, he'sstill in contention.''   But J. Kendrick Noble, a Macmillan analyst at PaineWebber GroupInc. in New York, said: ``I think the KKR-Macmillan bid is probablythe last bid. Should Maxwell come back a buck higher, there's noassurance KKR and Macmillan management might not stretch theirbid.''   Macmillan's deal with Kohlberg marks another multibillion-dollaracquisition for the investment firm, a specialist in leveragedbuyouts.   These acquisitions _ in which a company is bought largely withborrowed funds that are repaid through its earnings, cash flow orasset sales _ remain a frenetic area of corporate takeoveractivity. Kohlberg is one of the leaders, having played crucialroles in four of the biggest leveraged buyouts of the past threeyears.   Securities analysts said the Macmillan acquisition also mightradically alter the structure of the company, a leading publisherof educational materials with other businesses ranging fromdirect-mail marketing to the Berlitz chain of language trainingschools.   Some speculated that Kohlberg Kravis would sell eitherMacmillan's publishing or information division to help finance theacquisition. Others said Gump's, a Macmillan-owned chain ofhigh-quality retail stores and a mail-order business, might be sold.   Neither Kohlberg nor Macmillan officials would speculate on thepossible sale of any Macmillan units.   Under terms of the agreement, a Kolhberg subsidiary will begin atender offer of $85 cash per share for up to 26.1 million shares ofthe company, or 94 percent of the total. Kohlberg will offer apackage of securities it valued at $85 per share for the remaining6 percent.   If all shareholders tender their shares, Kohlberg will offerthem $80 cash and $5 in securities per share. The total offervalues the company's 27.76 million shares at $2.36 billion.   The Bass group, which owns about 9.2 percent of Macmillan'sshares, had a $75-a-share offer outstanding for the company, butmost analysts believed that was Bass's way of raising the stock'svalue through takeover speculation. If the Bass group sold itsshares to Kohlberg it would make about $75 million.</TEXT></DOC>
