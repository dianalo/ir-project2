 Many observed thatseldom have research and development (Randamp;D) projects been given as prominent aplace in a federal budget.andP;  Other industry watchers, while less enthusiastic,had to agree that in many respects Randamp;D fared better under this year's budgetthan last year's.andM;However, understanding the details of the budget is far more important thanreviewing its broad outlines.andP;  For that reason, the American Association forthe Advancement of Science (AAAS) calls members of the scientifc community toWashington each spring to dissect, denounce and defend the government's Randamp;Dfunding plans for the next fiscal year.andM;The Colloquium on Science and Technology Policy conference centered aroundthe analytical findings of the AAAS's Research and Development FY 1991report.andP;  The three-day conference was peppered with high-ranking White Houseofficials who either defined the specific branches of the government's Randamp;Dinterests or discussed the possible implications the budget poses for futureprojects.andM;There is an overall 7 percent budget increase for Randamp;D, with a 12 percentincrease in nondefense Randamp;D programs and an 8 percent increase in basicresearch.andP;  In the area of computer science and engineering, DARPA, NSF, andthe ONR remain the largest sources of government funds for Randamp;D.andM;Federal support in computer science is divided into two basic categories:defense and civilian.andP;  More than 60 percent of total federal Randamp;D expendituresin computer science and engineering are supported by the defense sector.andO;Moreover, federal Randamp;D activities are conducted in government andnonuniversity labs as well as in universities.andP;  The majority of the fundingfor computer science research supports activities outside of universities.andM;D.andP;  Allan Bromley, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy(OSTP), explains the thinking behind the President's budget: To prioritizefunding requests, the Office of Management and Budget follows three basicguidelines.andP;  They includeandM;1.andP;  Programs that address national needs and national security concerns,andM;2.andP;  Basic research projects, particularly university-based, individual andsmall group research, andandM;3.andP;  Adequate funding for the nation's scientific infrastructure andfacilities.andM;Bromley points out that one of the primary avenues OSTP will emphasize thisyear is high-performance computing--a dynamic technology for industrial,research and national security applications.andP;  Of first concern will be thedevelopment of hardware to enhance mainframes and address the parallelismneeded to make TERAOP computers perform trillions of operations per second.andO;The next phase will be software development, followed by the construction ofa fiber optic network.andM;Bromley, who also serves as assistant to the President for Science andTechnology, calls the FY 1991 budget an excellent one for Randamp;D.andP;  However, heis quick to add there are problems with those numbers.andP;  One of the mostserious involves the funding rate for grants at the NSF and NationalInstitute of Health (NIH).andP;  Despite a decade of funding increases, the moneyavailable for new, young investigators is very tight.andP;  Indeed, the scientificcommunity is partly to blame, he says.andM;&quot;We argued for multiyear grants and contracts to cut down on the amount ofpaperwork required to do research,&quot; recalls the OSTP director.andP;  &quot;Both  SF andNIH have responded to those requests, and in the process they builtsubstantial 'outyear mortgages' for themselves.&quot;andM;Inflation, Deficit:andM;The Silent KillersandM;Do not be fooled by the steep and steady growth trajectory in federal Randamp;Dbudgets because there is a built-in joker, warns William Carey of theCarnegie Corporation, New York.andP;  When we add the element of inflation andlook at the constant dollar, the value changes significantly.andM;The Bush budget boasts $71 billion in budget authority.andP;  Carey insists thatthe impulse to gloat over the elegant provisions for Randamp;D in new budgets isabruptly suppressed if we consider the toll of inflation.andP;  The constantdollar deflator indicates the purchasing power--or the Randamp;D power--is 30percent less, or $51 billion.andM;&quot;Government dollars are no more immune to inflation than yours or mine,&quot; saysCarey, detailing how tens of billions of current Randamp;D dollars have been burntby inflation over the past 15 years.andP;  He claims it is no wonder that evidenceclearly indicates that government support for new technology start-ups atresearch universities is at a near standstill.andM;&quot;Historic new budget authority not withstanding, the system is not working,&quot;says the consultant, who has worked on staff for five U.S.andP;  presidents.andO;&quot;Unthinkable thought it may be, there is no choice but to introduceextraordinary Randamp;D goals to tax policy, and do it the honest way.&quot;andM;Inflation is not the only budget-buster to worry about, says Harry S. Havens,Assistant Comptroller General of the U.S.andP;  The nation's deficit has had amarked impact on the federal budget and will affect future science andtechnology Randamp;D funding dramatically unless a responsible economic policy isinstituted--and soon.andM;There has not been a nickel's worth of progress made in dealing with the coreproblems of the deficit over the past seven years, Havens declares.andP;  Althoughthe President's budget indicates the national deficit will decline next yearto $64 billion from $152 billion in 1989, the comptroller says it is all amatter of semantics.andP;  Upon closer inspection, the only progress has been inhiding the deficit in a spreadsheet jungle and financing it by robbing thefuture.andP;  Moreover, he contends that deficit problems will fester unlesspolitical leaders are ready to negotiate a broad-range solution involvingboth sides of the budget: revenues and spending.andP;  Once again, the solutionmay involve increasing taxes.andM;&quot;We partied on borrowed money for a decade.andP;  Now, it's time to pay the band,&quot;Havens insists.andP;  &quot;If we continue our present course, we risk leaving futuregenerations of Americans a second-rate economy, able to support a second-ratestandard to support a second-rate standard of living, and a second-rate placein world affairs.&quot;andM;(Ironically, at press time, reports of FY 1991 budget negotiations inWashington claim President Bush may be softening his &quot;Read My Lips&quot; pledge asevidence points to increasing taxes as the primary means of lowering thedeficit.)andM;Congress may be instrumental in steering the flow of research dollars, butthe driving force behind those decisions is usually public opinion and thedegree to which the President welcomes advice on science and technology,according to Congressman Bill Green (R-NY), Ranking Minority Member HouseAppropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, HUD and IndependentAgencies.andP;  In his decade on the Hill he has watched Congressional attitudeson science and technology go through some major adjustments.andM;While scientists worry that future funding for new, smaller research projectsmay evaporate as the deficit and inflation consumer more dollars, Green triesto explain the government's &quot;big science&quot; versus &quot;small science&quot; mentality.andO;&quot;It is the contention in Congress that big will help small,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Wefeel that funding big projects like supercomputing will ultimately benefitsmall science because everyone will be able to use the facilities.&quot;andM;Changing OrdersandM;In a year rich with international reorganization, the U.S.andP;  finds itselffaced with even more competitive forces.andP;  The dawning of perestroika alongwith transformation of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe will no doubtinfluence U.S.andP;  budgets as well as technology research agendas.andM;Roald Sagdeev, former director of the Institute of Space Research with theUSSR, credits President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and perestroika with bringingabout a much needed change in national science and technology priorities inthe Soviet Union.andP;  Along with increasing funding for higher education,Gorbachev has also been instrumental in pushing for a 30 percent budget inbasis science.andM;Says Sagdeev: &quot;Is hope (these chanes) mean the old habit of using science asan instrument of prestige and a sign of supremacy is over.andP;  God knows, wetried.&quot;andM;Though confident these changes will strengthen their technology position inthe world order, Sagdeev interjects that Eastern Europe still suffers from astiff, conservative outlook which has further aggravated its severe braindrain problem.andP;  The inflexibility of institutional structures continues towiden the generation gap and drive potential researchers to study and workelsewhere.andM;Moreover, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are still fighting an uphillbattle in an environment where scientific research is viewed with suspicion.andO;Sagdeev describes a recent incident where a Moscow newspaper conducted anopinion poll to determine which government agencies the public trusted most.andO;The USSR Academy of Sciences came in last.andP;  Second to last was the KGB.andM;The future of computer science and engineering in both nations lies inresearch and research relies on financial backing, government or otherwise.andM;The Bush Administration believes that private industry, not federalgovernment, knows what is best for private industry.andP;  Bromley insists thatthe Bush White House will not adopt a policy that has the effect of pickingwinners and losers in the marketplace.andM;Therefore, the future will see industry and academia deepening the workingrelationships started in the 1980s, with universities taking greateradvantage of their position in the economics of opportunism.andP;  The future ofsmall science may depend on it.andM;Like industry, government looks at return of investment as the bottom line.andO;&quot;If you do not show economic return to research, the government, industry andgeneral public are going to start asking why it is being funded,&quot; says JosephAllen, director of the Office of Technology Commercialization, Department ofCommerce.andM;Bromley strongly urges researchers to share their thoughts and concerns overbudget funding with their representatives in Congress.andP;  Hopefully thiscommunications network will help ease the monetary restraints that threatenfuture technological progress.andM;&quot;We must recognize that to some extent we are the victims of our ownsuccess,&quot; Bromley concludes.andP;  &quot;It has been a remarkable decade in science.andO;The increased funds devoted to research during the 1980s have produced awealth of advances...andP;  The number of high quality applications is growingsteadily.andP;  We must now find some way of dealing with the remarkable progressthat we have made.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
