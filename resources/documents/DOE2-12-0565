<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0565 </DOCNO><TEXT>Location-independent data access methods are being developed at LawrenceLivermore National Laboratory to manage and use data acquired by a multivendordistributed laboratory computer network. An interprocess communicationsystem (IPCS) is used to connect tasks which produce, manage, or useexperimental data. These tasks may run on any of the computers in thenetwork. A central database and database server maintain supervisoryrecords of experimental activity and locations of data produced by theexperiment. Data may be located in several subsidiary local databases,file systems, or tape archives. Data access requests, if they cannotbe satisfied locally, are routed via the IPCS to database servers, whichlocate and retrieve (or store) the requested data. We describe the designdetails and give examples of the current implementation.</TEXT></DOC>
