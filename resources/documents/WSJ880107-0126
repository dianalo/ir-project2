Condemning Israel, while remaining on the sidelines, has characterized much of the Arab response to violence in Israel's occupied territories. Demonstrations and official denunciations have brought relations between Israel and Egypt to their lowest point since 1982, when Cairo withdrew its ambassador to protest Israel's invasion of Lebanon. Jordan and the Persian Gulf states also have raised the pitch of pro-Palestinian invective, and financial aid as well.    But Arab anger -- and pride in the Palestinian resistance -- is tempered by a feeling of impotence. And in Egypt's case, there is fear that anti-Israeli protests could turn into domestic upheaval.    &quot;Legitimate support is being expressed for the Palestinians,&quot; one highly placed Egyptian official said of recent protests in Cairo. &quot;But it can be exploited by {Islamic} fundamentalists and communists. This we will not accept.&quot;    Violence erupted in Cairo last Friday, when worshippers surged from a mosque chanting fundamentalist and anti-Israeli slogans. Participants say they were headed for a downtown synagogue when police dispersed the crowd, beating protestors and arresting more than 20. On Tuesday, a student protest at Ain Shams University flowed onto the street, and anti-Israeli slogans gave way to complaints about the curriculum and food prices. Police intervened with billy clubs and tear gas, making more than 50 arrests.    &quot;Many students are fed up about a lot of things and these rallies let them blow off steam,&quot; said student Nasser Taha, who avoided the protest because &quot;no one is listening, certainly not Israel.&quot;    Also on Tuesday, 150 lawyers burned homemade Stars of David on the steps of the Egyptian lawyers' union, shouting slogans such as &quot;What has Camp David done for us?&quot; and &quot;Egypt! Stand up for Palestinian rights!&quot; The pro-Palestinian lawyers' union has joined the parliamentary opposition to call for an end to diplomatic ties with Israel. Egypt is the only Arab country with such relations.    The government has harshly denounced Israel while deflecting demands that it withdraw its ambassador from Tel Aviv. &quot;If the ambassador were absent, we would have to communicate our opinion to the Israelis through a third party,&quot; President Hosni Mubarak told a Kuwaiti paper.    Next week, Mr. Mubarak tours the gulf, but officials there say they won't pressure him to take stronger action. &quot;Egypt is already doing everything it can to prove it is part of the Arab world, and we appreciate it,&quot; says Tariq al-Moayed, a Bahraini spokesman. Adds another gulf official: &quot;Egypt has suffered long enough from others telling it how to run its affairs.&quot;    Most Arab countries cut formal ties with Egypt following its peace treaty with Israel in 1979. Nine of them have resumed relations since November, when an Arab summit highlighted the need for Egypt's aid in opposing Iran.    Sheik Zayid bin Sultan, president of the United Arab Emirates, opened parliament this week by hailing the Palestinian &quot;uprising against the arrogance and atrocities of the Zionist enemy.&quot; The oil-rich sheik has donated $1 million to help families affected by the violence. In Qatar, an estimated 25,000 Palestinians will contribute a day's salary to relief efforts.    But gulf states haven't matched their words and checks with united action on the international front, preferring to let Egypt and Jordan carry the ball. Officials point to this week's United Nations vote, in which the U.S. joined in condemning Israeli plans to expel nine Palestinians, as evidence that quiet pressure works.    Officials also note that the Israelis have been their own worst enemy. &quot;One picture of {Israeli} soldiers pointing guns at unarmed boys is worth 100 lobbyists in America,&quot; says a diplomat who recently returned from Washington.    The violence also has advanced the Palestinian image among other Arabs, many of whom regard them as complainers rather than doers. This sentiment, some say, contributed to the neglect of the Palestinian issue at the recent Arab summit in Amman, Jordan, when the Iran-Iraq war dominated proceedings.    &quot;This rioting has ended any doubts that Palestinians are ready to stand up and fight for themselves,&quot; says Mishal al-Jarallah, editor of the Kuwait-based Arab Times. &quot;We are all watching them now.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
