A test facility is described for testing soilsfor their shear strength and slope stability. Several hydroelectric plantsaround the Soviet Union where these guidelines have been implementedduring design and construction are reviewed. An information retrievalsystem serving as a data bank for the mechanical properties of soilsis described.</TEXT></DOC>
