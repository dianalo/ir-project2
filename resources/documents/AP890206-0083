But in Tee-Mamou, a town of about 400 people deep in Cajuncountry, the ``courir du Mardi Gras'' has used trucks since 1919 _the year the horses died.   ``They were running pretty hard, it was rek,''said Larry G. Miller, Tee-Mamou-Iota Mardis Gras Folklife FestivalAssociation's folklikind of a long tfe director. ``They ended up runningacross ablue norther that was blowing in right at the end of their run.   ``They got to the farmhouse to do their gumbo, and tied thehorses up.''   When they went out later, about two-thirds of the 28 horses haddied from pneumonia brought on by the sudden chill after a long, hotrun.   ``It sobered up a lot of mardi gras early and it busted up thedance,'' said Miller, using ``mardi gras'' as folks do in theseparts, to mean those who participate in the drunken ride.   Since that night in Tee-Mamou, a town so small it seldom shows upon maps of Acadia Parish, the courir has been made by truck _ aflatbed at first, and now on a specially made wagon drawn by apickup. My Miller said, ``The only words that are both intheir song and our song is `We come from England.' That's kind ofcurious.''   That reference in French-speaking southern Louisiana may be toEngland's tradition of costumed peasants begging in hard times or tothe Acadians' flight from Nova Scotia after it became Englishterritory, he said.   After the chant and some dancing, things get really wild.   ``They break out and run all over the place, chasing chickens andgetting whatever charity they can get out of the farmhouse,'' saidLarry Miller.   ``They'll frequently go in to scare the womenfolks or children.It's kind of customary for the women and teen-age girls to bedeathly afraid of the mardi gras. And little boys as well,'' hesaid. ``It's kind of an ongoing thing from generation to generation.You grow up scared of the mardi gras.   ``Later on you become one of them.''</TEXT></DOC>
