Rothberg, Esq., Office of ChiefCounsel, for Export Administration, Rm. 3329, U.S. Department of Commerce,Washington, DC 20230.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order Confirming Consent Agreement</ITAG>The Office of Antiboycott Compliance, U.S. Department of Commerce (Agency),initiated administrative proceedings pursuant to Section 11(c) of the ExportAdministration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2401-2420), as reauthorizedand amended by the Export Administration Amendments Act of 1985, Pub. L.99-64, 99 State. 120 (July 12, 1985) (the Act), and Part 388 of the ExportAdministration Regulations (currently codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399(1988)) (the Regulations), against Zahi M. Kakish, individually and doingbusiness as American International Sales Development, Inc. (hereinafter``Respondent''). The Agency issued a Charging Letter, dated May 17, 1988,alleging that Respondent, as a United States person as defined in the Regulations,in his activities in interstate or foreign commerce, made with the intentto comply with, further or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott, violatedPart 369 of the Regulations on or about June 1, 1983. Respondent allegedlyfurnished sixteen items of information about other persons' business relationshipswith or in a boycotted country, with business concerns organized underthe laws of a boycotted country, and with persons known or believed tobe restricted from having any business relationships with or in a boycottingcountry, in violation of section 369.2(d) of the Regulations. The Agency and the Respondent have entered into a Consent Agreement inorder to settle this matter. In it the Respondent agrees to pay a civilpenalty in the amount of $48,000, all but ten percent of which is suspended.He will also be denied export privileges to the area of the Middle Eastfor a period of two years from the date this Order becomes final, one yearof which is suspended. The Middle East is defined for the purposes of thisOrder as: Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Qatar, SaudiArabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, the Yemen Arab Republic and the People'sDemocratic Republic of Yemen. The undersigned approves the terms of theConsent Agreement, however, my approval is given with some hesitation.On the one hand, as the record of prior cases clearly demonstrates, I donot second guess those who reach agreements after arduous negotiations.On the other hand, when agreements are reached and a settlement presented,Counsel must be candid in laying out the terms and impact of the agreement.That was not done here. I now understand that the agreement which I approveis significantly different from those usually considered. The denial ofvalidated, but not general, licenses is unique. I am most concerned athow the export community and export enforcement staff will be able to honorsuch distinction. The application of the denial to a named list of countriesis also a first, though in the past denials have been imposed against countrygroups so recognized in the Regulations. Such tailoring of the sanctionsmay impose significant monitoring problems for business and the bureaucracyand it deserves more specific justification in any future use. I also recognizethat the imposition of a denial in an Antiboycott case is probably a first.However, the failure to use that most appropriate remedy in the past shouldnot limit its present or future use. A most distressing aspect of this and recent settlements is the absenceof an acknowledgement of violation. These proceedings must first addressresponsibility, then proceed to an appropriate sanction. It is not appropriatefor Counsel to simply omit language relating to that most important aspectof these cases. In the future, the absence of such acknowledgment willbe the basis for outright rejection, absent some showing of a basis forthe omission for the record in the published disposition. I know of none,but my mind is not closed. I am not here to pontificate over extortionproceedings against businessmen. Nor do I think businessmen pay huge sumswhen they are innocent of wrongdoing. The determination of fault is a prerequisiteto the determination of penalty and the record should so reflect. Pursuant to the authority delegated to me by Part 388 of the Regulations,it is ordered that:<ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>I. Respondent is assessed a civil penalty of $48,000. Respondent is tomake four annual installment payments to the Agency of $1,200.

The payment of the remainder of the civil penalty set forth above ishereby suspended from a period of four years from the date on which thisOrder becomes final in accordance with andSection;388.16(c) of the regulationsand will be remitted without further action at the end of that period providedRespondent has committed no further violations of the Act, the Regulationsor the final Order entered in this proceeding during the four year suspensionperiod.
