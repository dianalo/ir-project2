Yet, at the same time, signs mount that the economy is reasonably robust, with brisk gains in employment, capital spending and exports leading the way to new highs in overall business activity.    The juxtaposition may seem peculiar, to say the least, but there's really nothing very odd about it. Recessions normally do arrive on the heels of relatively robust economic activity, not when business is stagnating. This is because, in a sustained upswing, a burgeoning economy eventually comes up against barriers -- financial as well as physical -- to further growth. A recession perforce ensues.    How close to such a barrier point is the economy now?    Closer, perhaps, than is widely recognized.    Consider, for instance, the latest survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management, whose members oversee the buying plans of most large U.S. corporations. Issued early this month, the report highlights what its respondents find to be the economy's continuing &quot;vigorous rate of growth.&quot; It uncovers &quot;no apparent ill effect&quot; from the October stock-market crash and concludes that &quot;a robust beginning for 1988&quot; is under way.    The finer print, however, speaks of &quot;slowing vendor deliveries&quot; and contains a remarkably long list of industrial materials in short supply. A dozen in all, these range from aluminum and copper to steel and caustic soda, from wood pulp and polyethylene to methanol and titanium dioxide. A second list, of materials whose prices are on the increase, is even longer, and a third, of those with falling prices, has but one entry -- fuel oil.    For perspective, just two materials were deemed to be in short supply a year ago, and none was listed as short as recently as the end of 1986. It's also noteworthy that only seven materials -- fewer than of late -- were in short supply in June 1981, just before the economy last slipped into a recession.    A similar pattern of tightening shows up in data tracing the rate at which U.S. factories are running. Above 82% of capacity, plant operations are at the highest overall level in nearly eight years. In fact, the December rate of 82.1% was more than two percentage points higher than at the onset of the 1981-82 recession. It compares with an operating level of only 68% near the end of 1982, when the latest economic upswing began.    Economists at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. reckon, it should be added, that &quot;effective utilization rates are probably higher than official measures&quot; indicate, since &quot;the growth of manufacturing capital stock slowed dramatically&quot; in recent years. They report as well that &quot;operating rates in paper and textile industries exceed 93%, the highest levels in 14 years,&quot; and that rates are also very high in various metals industries, with steel around 88% and aluminum at 92%.    With close to 6% of the labor force unemployed, it would appear at first glance that the supply of available workers remains ample. But other data that many analysts regard as more indicative of labor availability show that a record-low percentage of the working-age population, under 40%, holds no job. Moreover, the volume of help-wanted ads in newspapers across the country, though edging down, about matches levels just before the 1980 recession and far exceeds those prior to the 1981-82 slump.    Many &quot;industries do not have an adequate labor force to cope with an upsurge in domestic and foreign orders,&quot; cautions David Hale, economist of Kemper Financial Services Inc. Firms increasingly &quot;are having a difficult time providing components on time,&quot; he says, and labor-shortage &quot;problems may be more typical of U.S. manufacturing than is commonly realized.&quot;    A further sharp narrowing of the nation's trade deficit -- an avowed goal of U.S. policy makers -- would very likely bring on a severe new tightening of plant and labor resources, some analysts warn. Norman Robertson, economist of Mellon Bank, foresees factory operations near 90% of capacity -- a pace he deems unsustainable -- if the shortfall in trade approaches zero.    It's encouraging to note that recent surveys point to a substantial rise in plant-and-equipment outlays in coming months. But any significant capacity increase that eventually results from this spending rise remains well down the road.    A pattern of tightening is apparent as well on the financial front. For instance, the inflation-adjusted money supply, whether narrowly or broadly defined, is lower now than in early 1987. Usually, such prolonged declines have preceded recessions. But much faster monetary growth would risk further sharp declines in the dollar's already-shrunken international worth. And, among other things, new weakness in the dollar could deter foreigners from investing in the U.S. Huge foreign inflows, of course, have served to hold down strains in U.S. credit markets.    If the economy is close to bumping up against constraints to further growth, why has inflation remained relatively dormant?    In fact, viewed over the longer term, inflation has begun to accelerate. Last year's 4.4% rise in consumer prices was quadruple the 1986 gain, and most economists anticipate a 1988 increase of close to 5%. That would exceed the pace at the start of many past recessions and, were it to persist, would halve the dollar's buying power in under 15 years. </TEXT></DOC>
