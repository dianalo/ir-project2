New York Supreme Court Judge Edward Lehner issued a temporary injunction barring the institute from declaring the outcome of two votes on the mandatory membership issue pending a court hearing Friday.    The institute is seeking membership approval for a plan that would require accounting firms with any publicly traded clients to join its self-regulatory unit for firms that practice before the Securities and Exchange Commission. Membership in the SEC practice unit is currently voluntary.    The lawsuit centers on the manner in which the institute is balloting its 250,000 members. But institute officials say that the dispute really concerns opposition to mandatory membership in the SEC practice unit.    The four plaintiffs are also members of the National Conference of CPA Practitioners, a group with 1,100 CPA firms that has been pressing the institute to pay more attention to small and medium-sized CPA firms. Thus, the suit indicates that a longstanding rift in the profession between big and smaller CPA firms may be widening, industry observers say.    The plaintiffs are Philip Goldstein, managing partner of Shapiro, Fleischmann andamp; Co., a Miami-based firm; Eli Mason, managing partner of Mason and Co.; Ralph Rehmet, a partner of Mahoney Cohen and Co.; and Stanley Sachs, a partner of Weinick andamp; Sanders. The latter three firms are New York-based.    The institute first mailed ballots last January permitting members to register their votes anonymously. The plaintiffs say that when the ballots received showed only about 60% approval, less than the two-thirds vote required, the institute sent out a second ballot that wasn't anonymous and didn't include material giving both sides of the issue as the first ballot did. This second ballot, the suit says, violated the institute's &quot;lawful procedures&quot; and was &quot;arbitrary and capricious.&quot;    Donald Schneeman, the institute's general counsel, said the organization didn't have time to send a &quot;secret ballot&quot; in its second mailing and was rushing because of pressure from federal regulators and the institute's ruling council to increase membership in the self-regulatory unit. Under institute bylaws, a ballot of the members must be completed within two months of an initial vote mailing.    The SEC has just proposed mandatory peer review for CPA firms with publicly traded clients. The institute's ruling council last October approved sending the ballot and recommended an affirmative vote.    Mr. Goldstein, one of the plaintiffs, said it's unfair for the institute to make membership in the SEC practice unit mandatory for CPA firms with publicly traded clients. If his own firm didn't join, he said, &quot;all eight partners in the firm would lose institute membership entailing group-liability and life insurance, which are otherwise difficult to obtain for such low cost.&quot;    More than 1,600 accounting firms are members of the SEC practice unit. The unit's public oversight board, a body that critiques the unit's effectiveness in self regulation, has recommended that more accounting firms join to give the SEC practice unit more credence. In 1981, the unit had a record 2,205 accounting firms as members, but the cost of peer reviews required every three years by the unit caused some firms to resign.    Earlier this year, the National Conference of CPA Practitioners set up its own peer-review program for its members and others to rival the one that has been run by the institute since 1977. </TEXT></DOC>
