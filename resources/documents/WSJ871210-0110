The provision, included in a deficit-reduction bill, would limit to $500 the tax-free amount of salary that an employee can spend for benefits under such plans, if they include the option of cash instead of benefits. The cap would raise $3.2 billion over three years, according to congressional estimates.    More than three million workers use the tax break for cafeteria plans, which allow employees to choose among such benefit options as medical care, group-term life insurance, and dependent care for children, elderly parents or other relatives. Dependent care, which currently has a $5,000 annual limit, would be most affected by the proposed cap.    Cafeteria plans are geared toward the rise in the number of two-income families with unconventional benefit needs. &quot;The fact of the matter is that 90% of the work force in many of our businesses are not the sort of traditional husband works-wife stays at home with the two kids kind of families,&quot; says Thomas Butterworth, a partner at Hewitt Associates, a benefit-consulting firm. &quot;In such a diverse work force, choice is vitally important.&quot; Otherwise, wage earners are likely to have wasteful duplicate benefits that add to company costs and can prevent employees from getting the benefits they really need.    Supporters of the change argue that beyond revenue gains, the provision would make employee compensation more equitable for workers who don't have cafeteria benefit plans and don't get such tax breaks. &quot;Some people will lose something that most people never had,&quot; says a House aide. And they argue that businesses could continue to offer cafeteria packages without the tax subsidy, and in doing so better hold down some benefit costs -- a charge that many employers dispute.    But opponents argue that the measure would hurt families and older people with big medical and child-care needs, and cripple the use of such plans by business. Passage would &quot;certainly defeat the feminist agenda and the need to bolster the work force and provide adequate child care&quot; in this country, says Elaine Church, a senior manager at Price Waterhouse tax consultants.    &quot;If you look at who gets hit by this proposal, families are just hit square between the eyes,&quot; says Mark Wincek, an official of the Cafeteria Plan Coalition, a group of employers and others fighting the provision on Capitol Hill.    The cap would &quot;eliminate the use of cafeteria benefit plans,&quot; contends Liza Lidke, president of National Flexible Benefit Plans, a national resource and referral group. She argues that the tax incentive is a modest way to assist working families, calculating that in the case of child care, it typically cuts costs by 25% a month, providing income that keeps people &quot;off welfare and in the job force.&quot;    &quot;The real question is: 'Should benefits be taxed?'&quot; says Kenneth Feltman, executive director of the Employers Council on Flexible Compensation. &quot;Traditionally, organized labor, management and government have said 'No.'&quot; Now we have a revenue crunch and there are some folks in the government who are saying the answer should be 'Yes, and here's one way to start the process.'&quot;    He says the fairness argument is like saying, &quot;Somebody else's nest is dirtier than your nest; therefore to make it more equitable, we've got to make your nest dirty.&quot; He adds, &quot;Birds don't do that,&quot; and says that instead, there should be incentives for more employers to offer such plans.    Among the companies that sent a letter denouncing the cafeteria benefit cap to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) were Citicorp, the Continental Airlines unit of Texas Air Corp., Eastman Kodak Co., Marriott Corp., PepsiCo Inc., Procter andamp; Gamble Co., Time Inc. and Union Carbide Corp.    The House-passed provision isn't included in the Senate version of the bill, and opponents are working to keep it out of the conference version, which could be considered as early as next week. Strategists say Senate opposition seems assured, but the House effort led by Mr. Rostenkowski continues to support the provision. Warns one lobbyist: &quot;Anytime you have (Rep. Rostenkowski's support), you've got an uphill battle to keep it out of the bill entirely.&quot;    In a typical plan, an employee can cut child-care or any dependent-care costs, for instance, by using as much as $5,000 of pretax salary to help pay for the care. The House-passed bill would limit to $500 the annual amount of money excluded from an employee's taxable income under cafeteria plans.    The cap would have &quot;a dramatic impact on plans focusing on dependent care,&quot; says Mr. Butterworth. A Hewitt survey showed that the average employee expenditure on dependent care was just over $2,000 annually, compared with an average $523 in health-care spending.    Nationally, &quot;the vast majority&quot; of employer-provided child care isn't a center at the company's headquarters, but assistance through a cafeteria benefit plan, says Mr. Wincek of the Cafeteria Plan Coalition. But backers of the provision contend that such assistance is unfairly distributed. Complains a House staff aide: &quot;If the cafeteria-plan salesmen really cared about child-care costs they'd be advocating expansion of the (federal) child-care tax credit.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
