Austria's Interior Ministry in Vienna reported that 100 EastGermans were arriving at the border each hour.   West German border authorities said more than 700 new refugeesarrived overnight.   On Wednesday, Hungary's deputy foreign minister, Ferenc Somogyi,said his country will grant East Germans unfettered passage to theWest only temporarily. He did not elaborate.   Hungary has not made clear how long it will allow East Germans toleave for West Germany without permission from East Berlin.   Austrian officials said the number had exceeded 13,150 by middaytoday. Aid workers in Budapest said another 500 East Germans werewaiting for passage westward from international aid camps in Hungary.   Somogyi said in an interview on Wednesday that Hungary willrenegotiate agreements with its Warsaw Pact allies restrictingtravel to the West by East bloc citizens, to reflect its newcommitment to the rights of refugees.   But Budapest will only allow citizens from other East blocnations to cross its border with Austria if it determines they arerefugees under U.N. guidelines, Somogyi said.   The official MTI news agency reported a second day of talks inEast Berlin between a senior Hungarian Communist Party official,Maria Ormos, and an East German Politburo member in charge ofideology, Kurt Hager.   MTI described the talks as ``friendly and open'' but made clearthat the two Warsaw Pact allies remain far apart over Hungary's rolein the exodus.   In Berlin, the East German Communist Party daily, NeuesDeutschland, called the meeting ``businesslike and open.'' It alsomade no critical remarks about the Budapest government for the firsttime since the refugee wave began, suggesting some mending of therift created by the affair.   Somogyi insisted Wednesday that the East Germans ``were notrefugees, and they did not request asylum as refugees,'' becauseWest Germany grants citizenship on request to any East Germans.   In West Germany, officials said Wednesday that refugee camps wereemptying quickly as thousands left to join West German relatives andlook for jobs.   East Germany has bitterly accused its Warsaw Pact ally ofbreaking an agreement and undermining its sovereignty by allowingEast Germans to flee to the West.   Hungary's official MTI news agency carried a terse note Wednesdaynight from the Foreign Ministry, promising to ``extensivelycontradict'' accusations contained in a formal protest by the EastGerman government.   The rebuttal would come soon, the ministry said withoutelaboration.   Hungary's role illustrates the dramatic changes sweeping EasternEurope, especially in Poland and Hungary. Poland is the first WarsawPact nation to install a government led by non-Communists, whileHungary's reformist Communist leadership has promised free electionsby June.   A Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman today confirmed there wereEast German refugees holed up in the West German Embassy in Warsaw.About 50 East Germans were in the embassy, Polish televisionreported.   The Vatican newspaper today praised Hungary for permitting theexodus and lauded its recently introduced political and socialreforms in Hungary.   Hungary began removing barbed wire and other barriers from itswesternmost border in May, permitting more than 6,000 East Germansto escape over it.   It then allowed thousands more to flee beginning Sunday afterthousands of East German crammed makeshift camps to wait for passageto West Germany. They said they were tired of political repressionand economic stagnation in their country, one of the most rigidlycontrolled in the Communist world.   To resolve the crisis, Hungary suspended a 1969 accord with EastGermany agreeing no East Germans could leave for the West fromHungary without East Berlin's permission.   Somogyi said similar agreements with other Warsaw Pact countries``are no longer in line with our newly assumed internationalresponsibilities, such as our having signed the Geneva Convention onrefugees.   ``We are working to bring these various agreements into harmonywith the new foreign policy of our country,'' he said.   As part of its reforms, Hungary became the first Soviet blocnation to join the U.N. convention on the rights of refugees.   It has accepted about 17,000 fleeing Hungarian ethnics fromRomania and Hungarian officials acknowledge that tensions over thesituation contributed to its decision to join the U.N. convention.</TEXT></DOC>
