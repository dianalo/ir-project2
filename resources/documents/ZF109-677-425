(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Mary MannandM;As corporations' documentation increases, many seek relief from paper pileup.andO;Some firms archive their data to WORM drives, so that it cannot be modified.andO;Others store their information to rewritable optical drives, so that it canbe manipulated at will.andP;  New multifunction optical drives incorporatefunctions found in WORM and rewritable optical drives.andM;Two such drives include the LaserMemory DE-S7001 from Pioneer Communicationsof America Inc.'s Optical Memory Products Division and the LF-7010 fromPanasonic Communications and Systems Co.'s Office Automation Group.andM;International Advanced Concepts, a Pittsburgh-based VAR that providesoffice-automation solutions, relies on the LaserMemory DE-S7001 multifunctiondrive to help its clients condense paper files onto space-saving opticaldisks.andM;&quot;We shift offices from filing cabinets to the paperless approach,&quot; saidMohammed Kilany, the firm's managing director.andP;  &quot;Everything is transferred tothe optical WORM disk, so information can later be accessed on a need-to-knowbasis.&quot;andM;International Advanced Concepts' clients had previously used 9-trackmagnetic-tape reels, which provided 350M to 360M bytes of storage, saidKilany.andM;However, one optical disk stores 650M bytes of data; therefore, it providesalmost twice as much storage space as the magnetic tape.andM;Originally, Kilany said, executives from his firm had planned to purchaseWORM drives, but when they heard about multifunction drives they decided togo with the new technology.andM;&quot;We wanted a device that would provide users with greater flexibility byallowing the use of both WORM and rewritable optical technologies in onesystem,&quot; he said.andM;Without the multifunction drive, the buyer would have to purchase twoseparate drives to accommodate the use of WORM and rewritable optical diskcartridges, according to Kilany.andM;Because the Pioneer disks support a capacity of 650M bytes, they provide thebuyer with myriad storage capabilities, Kilany said.andM;Another benefit of the multifunction drive, he said, is that the WORM andrewritable disk cartridges it supports perform different functions.andM;&quot;The primary feature of the WORM drive is one of archiving,&quot; Kilany said.andO;And because users cannot alter information entered onto a WORM drive, hesaid, &quot;it assures the user that it is a true representation of the original.&quot;andM;This feature is especially beneficial in any industry that requires absoluteaccuracy for numerical and statistical data, such as the banking andinsurance industries.andM;&quot;WORM technology is strong in banking because it provides a permanent recordfor audit trails,&quot; said Tim Meyerhoff, product manager of optical products atPanasonic in Secaucus, N.J.andM;&quot;A lot of people believe that the advent of multimedia will cause WORMtechnology to disappear.andP;  I disagree,&quot; Meyerhoff said.andP;  &quot;There areapplications that require rewritable optical disks, but people don'tunderstand the applications of WORM.andP;  Today most banks use microfiche, butthat requires storage, and access times are longer.&quot;andM;The rewritable optical disk is best used for storing information that can bechanged, on-line, Kilany said.andM;&quot;The rewritable disk can be used as an extension of the computer's harddrive,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;When I exceed the capacity of my computer's harddisk, I can put more programs on the rewritable drive.andP;  It's like havinganother computer with 650M bytes of storage space.&quot;andM;Langston Campbell, president of PC Ideas International Corp., a softwareengineering firm offering photo database applications in Somerset, N.J., usesPioneer's LaserMemory DE-S7001 for security and data-retrieval purposes.andM;PC Ideas International has developed SecureVision 1.0, an application thatcombines graphics and data to provide visitor control, Campbell said.andO;Security guards can use this package to monitor the admittance of visitors.andO;Whenever a person's ID badge number is entered into the system, his or herfull-color, digitized image appears on the guard's screen, along withbiographical information.andM;Another package developed by the company, Docits 1.0, a document-retrievalsolution for use with mass-storage devices, provides users with enhancedstorage and retrieval functions.andM;Optical storage provides SecureVision and Docits with large storagecapacities, Campbell said.andP;  &quot;There are limitations on a hard drive,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;I can fit more pictures on an optical system.&quot;andM;The combination of the WORM and rewritable technologies is advantageous,Campbell said.andP;  He said the WORM cartridges are useful for archivedinformation and situations where the information does not change.andM;Many firms use SecureVision as a visitor control measure because there is alarge visitor turnover.andP;  &quot;The rewritable function allows for a large amountof turnover.andP;  For large databases, the disks can be reused,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;This means the user can store more data on one disk, and there is lesschance that the user has to archive data,&quot; he added.andM;With large data sets, Campbell said, the cost-effectiveness of optical mediaexceeds that of magnetic tape.andP;  &quot;With tape, a file can easily be lost,misplaced or destroyed,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But with optical storage, you can storethe same data and it can't be misfiled.andP;  It is not too easy to lose a fileon-disk.andP;  Plus, the user has immediate file access, which tape does notprovide.&quot;andM;Meyerhoff said optical disks are more cost-effective than 12-inch tape reelsthat store about 50M bytes.andM;&quot;It would take 40 reels to hold the information stored on one side of anoptical disk,&quot; Meyerhoff said.andP;  &quot;It saves space and is cheaper, mediawise.andO;Tapes cost $20 each, which translates to $400 for 20 tapes, whereas it onlycosts $250 per disk.&quot;andM;Although optical storage provides many benefits, Campbell said it does havenoticeable weaknesses, such as slow access times.andP;  &quot;The response time ofoptical, at about 35 to 70 milliseconds, is about three times slower than ahard drive, which is in the low twenties, possibly teens,&quot; he said.andM;He circumvented the speed issue through caching.andP;  &quot;We have developed cachingfor the document-storage retrieval program by caching from the optical diskto the hard drive for a faster response time,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The caching methodwrites the optical information to the hard disk, so the data request isalready on the hard disk.andP;  So to retrieve data that is used a lot, you can gofrom a slower medium to a faster medium.&quot;andM;One weakness that International Advanced Concepts' Kilany cited was the lackof industry standards among optical drives.andP;  &quot;The only limitation I see now,which is industry-wide, is that the user cannot use the erasable disk fromPioneer on any other drive,&quot; Kilany said.andM;Although Campbell expressed concern, he said he would not want to seeindustry standards at this point.andP;  &quot;Technology is evolving so fast thatstandards would be a stymied process,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
