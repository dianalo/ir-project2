Therefore, pursuant to the Commission's Rulesof Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 380.6(a)(3), an environmental impactstatement (EIS) will be prepared.The FERC will be the lead Federal agency and will produce an EIS satisfyingthe requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Written comments are requested to help identify significant issues or concernsrelated to the NIP Project to determine the scope of issues, includingalternatives that need to be analyzed, and to identify and eliminate fromdetailed study the issues which are not significant. All comments on specificenvironmental issues should contain supporting documentation and rationale.Written comments must be filed on or before November 20, 1989.Written comments should reference Docket No. CP88-171-001 and should beaddressed to the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 NorthCapitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. A copy of the comments shouldalso be sent to Mr. Kurt W. Flynn, Project Manager, Environmental Policyand Project Analysis Branch, Office of Pipeline and Producer Regulation,825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.Comments are also requested on the specific environmental issues whichexist at any of the sites where NIP Project-related nonjurisdictional facilitieswould be constructed (see table 1). If no issues are raised and the nonjurisdictionalfacilities have been approved or are being reviewed at the state or locallevel, or if there are no direct tie-ins to the interstate pipeline network,the Commission staff intends to limit its environmental review. In thiscase, the review would primarily address the potential indirect effectson endangered species and cultural resources.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The FERC's Northeast proceedings produced four separate settlement projects.The NIP Project was formed as a direct result of the Niagara SettlementProcess (NSP).As a result of the NSP the following companies filed applications withthe FERC pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act: Tennessee Gas PipelineCompany (Tennessee), Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company (Transco),National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel), Penn-York EnergyCorporation (Penn-York), PennEast Gas Services Company (PennEast), CNGTransmission Corporation (CNG), Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation(Texas Eastern), and Algonquin Gas Transmission Corporation (Algonquin).Tennessee also filed an application with the Commission for a Presidentialpermit pursuant to section 3 of the Natural Gas Act for authorization toconstruct and operate facilities at the international border between theUnited States and Canada.Great Lakes Gas Transmission Company (Great Lakes) filed a related applicationwith the FERC, pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. In its application,Great Lakes seeks authorization to expand its facilities to provide additionalfirm transportation service for TransCanada Pipeline Limited (TransCanada).Upon delivery from Great Lakes, TransCanada would transport the gas toits existing interconnection with Tennessee at the Niagara Import Pointlocated at the United States/Canadian border in Niagara County, New York.The purpose of the NSP applications is to transport for various customersa cumulative total of up to 587,118 thousand cubic feet a day (Mcfd) ofnatural gas. The gas would be transported from the Niagara Import Pointand delivered to local distribution companies, cogeneration plants, storagefacilities, and a power plant in the Northeastern United States.The Commission has determined that some of the facilities included underthe NSP can be phased as independent projects based on the existing capacityof TransCanada and the firm commitments of downstream users. For example,the Commission approved the SS-2 Storage Service (SS-2) Project as an independentphase of the NSP applications. It also appears that the TEMCO/Niagara (TEMCO)Project phase of the NSP applications may also be independent of the remainingNIP Project. As further discussed below, the TEMCO Project phase is beingaddressed in a separate environmental document.Overall FacilitiesThe Great Lakes and the NSP facilities consist of approximately 633.63miles of 12-, 24-, 30-, 36- and 42-inch-diameter pipeline loop; 5.86 milesof 20- and 24-inch-diameter replacement pipeline; 45.85 miles of new 20-,24- and 30-inch-diameter pipeline; the addition of 43,000-horsepower (hp)of compression at existing compressor stations; and 20,600 hp of new compressionat two proposed compressor stations.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ A pipeline loop is a segment of pipeline which is usuallyadjacent to an existing pipeline and connected to it at both ends. Theloop allows more gas to flow through the pipeline without additional compression.NIPProjectThe NIP Project, which includes the Great Lakes facilities, would consistof approximately 535.7 miles of 12-, 24-, 30-, and 36-inch-diameter pipelineloop; 5.58 miles of 20-inch-diameter replacement pipeline; 4.85 miles ofnew 24- and 30-inch-diameter pipeline; the addition of 28,000 hp of compressionat existing compressor stations; and 20,600 hp of new compression at twoproposed compressor stations. Table 2 lists the locations of the proposedfacilities by county and state. The appendix to this Notice provides amore detailed discussion of the proposed actions by each applicant in theNIP Project. The appendix also includes figures which show the generallocation of the facilities proposed.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The appendix is not being printed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. However, copies are being mailed to everyoneon the Commission's service and mailing lists. Copies are also availablefrom the Commission's Public Reference Branch at (202) 357-8118.SS-2 ProjectPhaseThe SS-2 Project phase consists of the construction and operation of facilitiesin order to provide storage service to eight electric generators or localdistribution companies. Facilities for the SS-2 Project include 67 milesof 20-, 24-, 30-, 36-, and 42-inch-diameter pipeline facilities as wellas metering facilities at the existing Leidy Compressor Station. An environmentalassessment (EA) for these facilities was completed by the Commission staffin July 1989. On July 27, 1989, the Commission issued an <T3>Order Issuing Certificates and Approving Abandonment</T3> for the SS-2Project.TEMCO Project PhaseThe TEMCO Project phase would consist of approximately 72.5 miles of 16-,24-, 30-, and 36-inch-diameter gas transmission pipeline loops; 0.28 mileof 24-inch-diameter replacement pipeline; 15,100 hp of additional compressionat 4 existing compressor stations; and the addition and modification ofmeasurement facilities.A part of the TEMCO Project includes 31.4 miles of 30-inch-diameter pipelineloop on the existing Niagara Spur line. The entire Niagara Spur loop wouldbe jointly owned by Tennessee, National Fuel, and PennEast.The purpose of the TEMCO Project would be to provide transportation serviceson behalf of Transco Energy Marketing Company, Altresco Pittsfield Ltd(Altresco), and four Tennessee mainline customers (Altresco, ANR VentureSpringfield, Flagg Energy and Capitol District). In addition, Tennesseehas indicated that the construction of the Niagara Spur loop would eliminatethe need for 2,200 hp of compression previously approved by the Commission.For these reasons, the Commission staff will review the TEMCO Project ina separate EA which is currently under preparation.The SS-2 and TEMCO Projects are not dependent upon the facilities proposedby Great Lakes.<ITAG tagnum="84">Outline of Current Environmental Issues</ITAG>The EIS will address the environmental concerns that have been and willbe identified by the FERC staff, interveners, other Federal and state agencies,and individuals who respond to notices on this project.

These include: 49 CFR Part 192_Transportationof Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards;18 CFR Part 2.69_Guidelines to be Followed by Natural Gas Pipeline Companiesin the Planning, Clearing, and Maintenance of Rights-of-way; and otherapplicable Federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The NIP Project facilities are scheduled to be constructed in 1990and 1991. Pipeline construction would begin with the clearing and gradingof a 40- to 75-foot-wide construction right-of-way (depending primarilyon pipe diameter) to prepare a relatively level strip to accommodate constructionequipment. Replacement pipleines in or adjacent to existing rights-of-waywill require less clearing and grading. Rotary wheel ditching machines,backhoes, or rippers, would be used to excavate a trench deep enough toprovide the minimum depth of cover required by the U.S. Department of Transportation(normally 30-36 inches). Blasting would be required in areas of unrippableconsolidated rock.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After trenching, pipe segments would be strung along the right-of-way,bent to conform to the contours of the trench, welded together, coated,and lowered into the trench. The trench would be backfilled using previouslyexcavated materials if these are suitable for contact with the pipeline.If not, more suitable, rock-free material would be brought in to pad thetrench. Topsoil that was conserved would be replaced at approximately itsoriginal position. The right-of-way would be restored to its original contoursas much as practicable, and reseeded, limed, fertilized, and mulched inaccordance with erosion and sedimentation control plans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Special construction methods would be employed across wetlands, rivers,and streams to provide stable work areas for the construction equipmentand to restore the begetation and prevent changes in natural drainage patterns.Small streams would be trenched using a backhoe, clam dredge, dragline,or similar equipment. For major river crossings, floating excavation quipmentmay be required to dig the trench. Blasting may be necessary for streamsand rivers with rock bottoms. Work areas required for major river constructionwould be located back from the water line. Construction methods for crossingsmall wetlands would be similar to those used on dry land. Constructionin large wetland areas would involve using the ``push-pull'' technique(i.e., after the trench is dug the pipe joints are welded together in onearea, flotation devices are attached to the pipe, and the whole assemblyis floted into position). Once the pipe is positioned over the trench theflotation devices are removed and the pipe settles to the bottom of thetrench. The trench is then backfilled with suitable coarse material.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-24630 Filed 10-18-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6717-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
