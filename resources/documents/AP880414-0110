Jerry Falwell, whose Moral Majorityhelped elect President Reagan in 1980, said today he does notbelieve the American people are ready to put religious leaders suchas Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson in the White House.   Falwell, speaking to nearly 700 newspaper editors, also said thesex-and-money scandals that have toppled Jimmy Swaggart and Jim andTammy Bakker from their ministries signaled the end of celebritystatus for televangelists.   ``There will never again, and I thank God it's true, be a personthat people look up to as God,'' Falwell said. ``Celebrity statusis history.''   Asked about Jackson's bid for the Democratic presidentialnomination, Falwell said, ``I have no problem with Reverend Jacksonrunning, as long as he loses.   ``I don't think the American people want a reverend _ it hasnothing to do with Democrat, Republican, black, white, liberal,conservative. I don't think the American people are ready for areverend to be in the White House, and I think it's a pretty goodidea one never is.''   Falwell, participating in a panel discussion on the second dayof the three-day American Society of Newspaper Editors convention,said he was heartened by a decision by a television committeewithin the National Religious Broadcasters to punish Swaggart.   The committee members ``are recommending to all Christianstations in America that are members of the National ReligiousBroadcasters ... to drop Jimmy Swaggart's program if, in fact, hedoes not comply with the one-year required penalty placed upon him.... Stations do not have to comply, but my guess is most of themwill.''   Earlier today, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, urged theeditors to support him in his battle to get a comprehensive tradebill passed by Congress.   ``You hold the key to developing a thoughtful commentary onevents,'' Wright said, later adding, ``I challenge you to reportthe bill in some depths.''   In a session late Wednesday, big-city mayors gave generally goodgrades to newspapers for coverage of the plight of the urban poor,but said the media misunderstand the rise of blacks' politicalpower and often fail to put a city's problems into a nationalcontext.   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young said he has been pleased that thenumber of black reporters covering City Hall has increased inrecent years, while Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode noted thenew prominence given to black columnists.   But Goode said he was concerned that some newspapers are notadequately covering the growth of black political power in cities.``Maybe some newspapers even resent it,'' he said.   Goode said he also believes the local media tend to reportproblems such as homelessness and inadequate housing from a localcontext rather than explaining that cities across the country arefacing similar troubles.   San Antonio, Texas, Mayor Henry Cisneros faulted the media forfailing to report more on the problems of the underclass.   ``These issues are not minority issues,'' Cisneros said. ``Theseare America's issues.''   Former New York Mayor John Lindsay said blacks and otherminorities have made major strides in the 20 years since a nationalcommission warned that America ``is moving toward two societies,one black, one white.''   But, Lindsay said, ``There are still miles to go.''   Lindsay criticized the Reagan administation for doing nothing toerase the economic differences between blacks and whites, andconcluded: ``We probably have a worse problem now in relationsbetween whites and blacks.''   The discussion of coverage of urban affairs followed a sessionearlier Wednesday in which Arnold Rosenfeld, editor of the Austin(Texas) American-Statesman, delivered an ASNE report on minorityemployment on newspaper staffs. A survey of 67 percent of thenation's 1,630 daily newspapers showed a slow growth in the pastyear in employment of blacks, Hispanics, Asians and AmericanIndians, from 6.56 percent to 7.02 percent.   ``Obviously, much needs to be done,'' Rosenfeld said.   Linda Grist Cunningham, editor of the Trenton (N.J.) Times,reported on a survey of journalists that found ``the people whogather and process the news today are predominantly white and male,but women and minorities are gaining in numbers.''</TEXT></DOC>
