None of the guns in the no. 2 turret had been fired before theexplosion instantly killed the seamen, Navy officials said. Theydiscarded a theory that the blast had been sparked by red-hotdebris left in the gun's breech by earlier rounds.   The Navy organized a board of inquiry and placed a moratorium onfiring 16-inch guns, found only on the Iowa and its three sisterbattleships, the New Jersey, the Wisconsin and the Missouri.   The Iowa was headed back to its home port at Norfolk, Va., whilethe bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at DoverAir Force Base in Delaware and families of the battleship's 1,600crewmen waited to learn whether their relatives were among the dead.   At the White House, chief of staff John Sununu announcedPresident Bush will attend a memorial service Monday for thevictims in Norfolk. He said the president had heard of the serviceand told his staff ``if it could be fitted in, he wanted to bethere ... wants to be a part.''   The blast occurred Wednesday morning northeast of Puerto Rico asthe Iowa took part in firing exercises that were part of navaltraining.   A spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet and the ship's former captainboth said the explosion in the No. 2 turret could have beentriggered by red-hot debris from earlier firings in the three-gunturret.   But Cmdr. Mark Baker, chief of the Navy's Pentagon press office,said later that none of the turret's three guns had been fired.   Only four rounds of 22 scheduled to be fired as part of atraining exercise had been fired, he said, and all had been fromthe No. 1 turret, forward of the one that exploded.   No eyewitnesses survived Wednesday's explosion behind one of the16-inch guns on the Iowa, one of the largest warships ever.   Pentagon officials declined to speculate publicly about theexact cause of the disaster, the worst to strike a Navy ship since1977, but two officers _ Capt. Paul Hanley, a fleet spokesman, andCapt. Larry Seaquist, the ship's former captain _ said a possibleexplanation was that red-hot debris from a previous round ignitednew charges.   But Seaquist stressed, ``We simply do not know what caused thatpowder to go.''   Baker said no guns in the No. 2 turret had been fired and theorder had just been given to the No. 2 turret crew to load andprepare the center gun when the explosion occurred.   ``We have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired,'' DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney told reporters as he headed back toWashington from a NATO meeting in Brussels.   The Iowa sailed to Roosevelt Roads Navy Base in Puerto Rico tounload the bodies, which were then flown to Delaware. Navyinvestigators boarded the ship as it left for Norfolk, where it isexpected to arrive Sunday or Monday.   Navy Secretary William Ball attended a memorial service at theDelaware base, home of the armed services' largest mortuary. Theflag-draped coffins were carried off a plane by Navy honor guards.   Around the United States, Navy officers and chaplains broke thebad news to the dead men's next of kin.   The job began just before midnight Wednesday, when officials inNorfolk received the list of the dead.   ``I've done it many times and I'll never get used to it,'' saidCmdr. Doug Palmer, acting chaplain for the Norfolk Navy Base. Fivemen had families in the Norfolk area.   The commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet, Adm. Jerome Johnson, whowas on board the Iowa, told reporters in Puerto Rico, ``The fireand explosion was instantaneous.''   Cheney indicated the casualties were all in the swiveling gunhouse at the top of the turret, rather than the mechanicalcompartments and ammunition magazines below it.   Eleven men escaped from powder magazines deep within the ship atthe base of the turret. A dozen crew members suffered minorinjuries fighting the fire caused by the explosion. They weretreated and returned to duty, said Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman.   At the White House, President Bush brushed aside suggestionsthat the explosion was due to the age of the Iowa, a World War IIleviathan brought out of mothballs during the military buildup ofthe Reagan administration.   Asked about the ship's safety, Bush said he wanted to insurethat procedures were checked ``to be sure that safety is at thehighest point ... but I wouldn't jump to the conclusion thatbecause that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that waythat makes a useful platform obsolete.''   Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey,began the board of inquiry's investigation. Hoffman said he couldnot predict when the investigation would be completed.   Seaquist told reporters, ``It seems from the reports that thosepowders exploded.'' He referred to the six 110-pound sacks ofpowder rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a 1,900-poundshell.   Seaquist said a pressurized air system that clears debris fromthe breech at a gun's rear must be operated manually. Each gun hasa one-inch diameter tube carrying air under 3,000 pounds ofpressure to blow debris from the 62-foot barrel.   The only officer killed was Lt. j.g. Phillip Edward Buch fromLas Cruces, N.M., who would normally be in a small compartment atthe rear of the swivelling top of the turret, adjacent to the roomin which shells are loaded.   Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion canoccur if a gun breech is cracked, or from a shell that ``cooksoff'' _ ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel orsmoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round.   ``The first thing that comes to mind is something like acook-off,'' said Hanley. ``It could have been a bag or aprojectile. We just don't know yet.''   None of the four battleships of the Iowa class, which sawservice in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, has eversustained such an explosion, Pentagon officials said.   Wednesday's explosion brought the worst loss of life for theNavy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died whena launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton wasstruck by a Spanish freighter.   Except for two World War II Japanese battleships and the currentNavy aircraft carriers, the 58,000-ton ships of the Iowa class arethe largest warships in the world.</TEXT></DOC>
