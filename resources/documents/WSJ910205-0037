There was much talk about how the voluble former mayorof Burlington might liven up the Democratic caucuses. Well,it now turns out that Congressman Sanders is being shunned bythe Democrats. Terrified that someone in America mightsomehow associate congressional Democrats with the &quot;S&quot; word,the leadership is trying to make Bernie Sanders sit with theRepublicans.   To do this, though, they want to force House Republicansto give Mr. Sanders three of their subcommittee slots on theBanking Committee. That's no problem in the House of Lords.Last month, committee Democrats passed an amendment reducingGOP strength on key subcommittees to well below what theirnumbers in the full House would call for. The consumeraffairs panel, for example, now at 11 Democrats and 7Republicans, would go to a ratio of 11-6 with Mr. Sanderstaking a GOP slot.</LP><TEXT>   Now, we suppose that replacing a Republican subcommitteemember with a Socialist would be thought of as little morethan a fraternity prank by a party that has been in power for36 straight years. Still, we wonder if anyone other than theDemocratic leadership is laughing.   Everyone knows Mr. Sanders wanted to join the Democraticcaucus, not the Republican one. And why not? That caucusalready offers safe harbor to two members -- Ron Dellums ofCalifornia and John Conyers of Michigan -- who have beenaffiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America. Whenthe Democrats decided to bar Mr. Sanders from their caucus,their Steering and Policy Committee nonetheless appointed himto the Banking Committee. That committee's Democrats,however, shrank back in horror at the prospect of a Socialistjoining them in their continuing efforts to manage the thriftdebacle. They refused to find room for Mr. Sanders in theirranks.   The fact is that current committee ratios assume there'llalways be only two parties represented in the House. Butgiven public disgust with the Remocrats and Depublicans andthe fact that independents won two governorships last fall,maybe it would be wise if the rules were now changed toanticipate the continuing presence of independents inCongress. A simple solution would be to add another seat towhatever committee a non-affiliated member was named to.   House Democrats can't have it both ways. Either Mr.Sanders has been appointed to the Banking Committee by theDemocrats, who should now give him his relevant subcommitteeslots, or he hasn't been. As things now stand, they'reholding him at arms length, like some unwanted cousin, whilesimultaneously using him to erode further whatever principlesof fairness still adhere to Congress.   Bernie Sanders says he is closer to the Democrats than anyother party. They say he's not their kind. No word yet onwhether the Democrats plan to make Bernie Sanders serveVermont while wearing a scarlet S.</TEXT></DOC>
