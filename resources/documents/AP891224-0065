It'senough.''   The crowd, estimated by police at 500, waved Romania's flag withthe communist emblem torn out, burned portraits of deposed dictatorNicolae Ceausescu, and sang the country's national anthem.   Earlier Sunday, hundreds more Chicagoans with Eastern Europeanroots wore black armbands at church services for victims of theturmoil in Romania.   In New York, about 200 people demonstrated across the streetfrom the Romanian Mission to the United Nations.   Princess Margaret, daughter of exiled King Michael, told thecrowd in English of her support for the popular movement inRomania, then said ``Thank you'' in Romanian, according to the Rev.Aurel Radulescu, head of the coalition Romania 21.   Romania 21 has organized daily demonstrations outside themission since the uprising in Romania began, more recently tocelebrate and appeal for international aid.   In Portland, Ore., more than 125 people gathered in downtownPioneer Square to sing Christmas carols and light Christmascandles. Three men held high a Romanian flag.   ``We want to express our joy at the freedom,'' said John Pirva,who has lived in Portland for the past eight years.   One man held a sign with a picture of Ceausescu captioned``Wanted for Mass Murder,'' referring to the massacre of thousandsof protesters in Timisoara, Romania, last weekend.   Romania's massive protests began Dec. 15 in Timisoara. Theprotests spread to Bucharest, forcing Ceausescu to flee his palaceFriday.   The revolt was sparked when ethnic Hungarians in Timisoararallied to the defense of Presbyterian-Calvinist minister LaszloTokes, who was about to be deported for preaching in his nativeHungarian tongue.   During the afternoon rally in single-digit temperatures atChicago's Daley Center Plaza, demonstrators carried signs reading,``Make my day _ kill a dictator today'' and ``Ceausescu = Murder.''Others called for U.S. military aid to partisans battling withsecurity forces loyal to Ceausescu.   ``If the State Department would permit us to go there we wouldhave a battalion ready,'' said Mikleu, a history professor atOakton College in suburban Des Plaines.   Speakers attempting to address the rally could not be heardabove the chanting crowd.   At the morning mass at St. Stephen King of Hungary Church,parishoners mourned the deaths of ethnic Hungarians and others inthe violence that has engulfed Romania since last weekend.   ``I hope that this will bring about a more democratic societywith freedom of speech and religion where people can practice theirown culture and language,'' said Gabriel Pataky, a member of thecongregation.   The 250 worshipers expressed hope that any new regime in Romaniawould respect the rights of the 2 million ethnic Hungarians in thecountry.   ``To replace one repressive regime with another repressiveregime doesn't benefit anyone,'' Pataky said.   The Hungarians were joined by representatives of other EastEuropean ethnic groups, including Romanians, Poles and Ukrainians,who pledged their support for democratic change.   ``We're here as proof of our intentions of cooperation among ourpeoples,'' said Vasile Bouleanu, a Romanian.   Chicago Alderman Roman Pucinski, a leader of the Polishcommunity, praised the Romanians who stood up to Ceausescu'ssecurity forces.   ``What we are witnessing today is that people power is thegreatest power in the world,'' Pucinski said. ``We are hopeful thatit won't be long before all the nations in the world will be ableto live in freedom and dignity.''
