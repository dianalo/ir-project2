Because of confusion over the complex tax-withholding form, many taxpayers' take-home pay is higher than it should be. Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates says this may be spurring spending and adding as much as a full percentage point to economic growth this quarter. But spending may slow when consumers have to make up for the underpayment.    Treasury Secretary Baker warns of &quot;unpleasant surprises down the road&quot; for those who remain underwithheld. Congress rushes to propose bills waiving penalties for such taxpayers. But some worry that the measures could become vehicles for efforts to restore breaks killed by the new tax law.    The current furor, a former IRS official warns, &quot;is nothing like what will happen next spring, in an election year,&quot; when people discover they owe big tax bills.    PAKISTAN'S PUSH for U.S. radar planes creates a diplomatic dilemma.    The Pakistanis want Awacs planes made by Boeing to help detect Soviet jets on their border with Afghanistan. But rival India, the Pentagon says, opposes the planes as &quot;all-seeing, all-knowing&quot; radar systems that would spy on India, especially if the Soviets withdraw from the Afghan war. Citizens of India in the U.S. begin a lobbying effort to kill the plane sale.    The Pentagon, which dismisses talk of a Soviet withdrawal, tries to defuse the dispute. It prods Pakistan to buy a less controversial and cheaper early-warning plane from Grumman Corp. But India remains adamant against sending any radar planes to Pakistan. A U.S. defense official sums up India's argument as &quot;Why don't you just give them balloons?&quot;    DISPUTES ESCALATE over how to wage the war against drugs.    Bipartisan support grows in Congress to spend more for anti-drug education and state drug-enforcement grants than Reagan proposed. Critics complain that the FBI needs more personnel to probe international trafficking rings. The Coast Guard and the Customs Service squabble over jurisdictional issues in the Bahamas.    Officials hope the arrest of alleged Colombian drug kingpin Carlos Lehder will spur broader anti-drug efforts. One official calls Lehder's extradition &quot;a clear indication&quot; of improved Colombian cooperation. Other Latin American nations now may be more willing to go after drug smugglers, the Justice Department says.    But U.S. drug agents say Panama's bank-secrecy laws and Mexican police corruption remain stumbling blocks.    BAKER BID? Friends of Howard Baker say the former Senate majority leader has all but decided to seek the GOP presidential nomination. Eased concerns about his wife's health and the lack of a strong front-runner are cited as factors. Baker was in Iowa last week and plans a New Hampshire trip.    FLYING NUNN: Sen. Nunn's unusual clout on defense issues is underscored as he rocks Reaganites with his letter criticizing proposals for an early SDI deployment. But some fellow Democrats assert that a potential Nunn presidential bid would erode his influence. &quot;If he decides to run for president, everything he does will be colored,&quot; says House whip Coelho.    FAMILY TIES: New White House aide Gary Bauer considers suggesting an executive order requiring cabinet members to attach a &quot;family fairness statement&quot; to all proposals. The order, he says, would &quot;at least make the bureaucrats think about&quot; policies' impact on families.    WOMEN EMERGE as top candidates to fill senior White House staff vacancies. Outgoing communications chief Patrick Buchanan recommends as his replacement Mari Maseng, now head of Reagan's public-liaison office. Two women are among choices for cabinet secretary. But women have been rumored before for top White House jobs that went to men.    BROADCASTERS MOBILIZE to attack license-renewal challenges.    The National Association of Broadcasters makes eliminating hearings in which applicants sue to take over licenses &quot;a top priority.&quot; It contends that this type of challenge is too costly and rarely successful. Only three licenses have been opposed since June, but the industry fears more attempts from applicants seeking &quot;broadcastmail&quot; -- a cash settlement to drop opposition.    Though the deal was later canceled, GenCorp agreed to pay a challenger $98 million in order to clear the sale of a Los Angeles TV station. Washington Rep. Swift plans to introduce legislation to bar certain challenges. Challengers deny they are after money. Advocacy groups such as the Media Access Project argue that renewal hearings provide needed public pressures.    &quot;They create a tremendous measure of accountability on the part of broadcasters,&quot; says Andrew Schwartzman, the project's director.    MINOR MEMOS: Budget Director Miller boasts that his tough budgeteers are &quot;the kind of people that run over dogs,&quot; adding, &quot;I meant that in the best possible way.&quot; . . . After being corrected by Treasury chief Baker on pronouncing Ivan Boesky's last name, Continental Illinois Chairman John Swearingen quips: &quot;Hell, I know. I just don't want to admit to you feds that I know him.&quot; . . . Hart's New Hampshire campaign, to show grass-roots support, plans to collect 10,000 dimes to pay its primary filing fee. </TEXT></DOC>
