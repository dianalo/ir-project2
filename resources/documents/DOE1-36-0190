<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-0190 </DOCNO><TEXT>The granular magnetization model of Finnemore et al. (1987) has been testedon a well-characterized sample of Y{sub 1}Ba{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}Ox. The temperaturedependence of the magnetic susceptibility is in excellent agreement withthe model. In addition, the grain size deduced from the magnetizationdata (1-2 microns) is in reasonable agreement with direct scanning-electron-microscopymeasurements of the microstructure. 8 references.</TEXT></DOC>
