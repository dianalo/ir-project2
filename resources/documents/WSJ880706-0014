Warburg Securities Inc. &quot;This was one of the lightest trading days I can remember in a long while.&quot;    Prices of long-term Treasury bonds fell about half a point, or about $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporates, municipals and mortgage-backed bonds also edged lower, while most short-term interest rates were little changed.    Somewhat to the surprise of many traders, there was hardly any reaction in the credit markets to growing U.S.-Iran tensions stemming from the U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner Sunday. Several analysts thought investors might rush to sell long-term bonds and buy the safest of all securities, short-term Treasury bills. Some also thought oil and gold prices would surge. But that speculation proved unfounded.    &quot;I don't think the bond market reacted to the airline disaster at all,&quot; said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist and senior vice president at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. Instead, he said, bonds reacted mainly to &quot;the dollar's failure to maintain its rise above the 135 level&quot; against the Japanese yen in overnight trading.    Traders also are apprehensive about a Labor Department report to be released Friday on the nation's employment picture last month. Many analysts expect the report to provide additional evidence of strong economic growth, which in turn would heighten inflation fears. If the report shows very strong employment gains, the Federal Reserve Board might react by nudging short-term interest rates higher, some analysts say.    Mr. Brusca of Nikko Securities expects the report to show the number of workers on non-farm payrolls surged 245,000 during June. That would compare with May's gain of 209,000.    &quot;I still see interest rates going up further,&quot; Mr. Brusca said. By year end, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, now about 8 7/8%, should hit 9 3/4%, he said.    David B. Bostian Jr., president of Bostian Research Associates Inc., disagrees. In an interview with Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, Mr. Bostian said he still is bullish on stocks and bonds, as he has been for the past several months. He recommends that pension funds be fully invested, with 60% of their assets in stocks and 40% in bonds.    Mr. Bostian predicted that long-term Treasury bonds will yield less than 8% by year end. &quot;The bond market has a potential to rally a lot more than most people think,&quot; he said. &quot;Our macroeconomic index does not show that the economy is about to overheat. It clearly would suggest there are not enough demand pressures to create inflation.&quot;    Most analysts in a recent survey by The Wall Street Journal predicted continued economic growth for at least another year. Mr. Bostian also sees continued growth for the rest of this year, but he expects &quot;a significant slowing&quot; in the rate of growth early next year. &quot;The bond market will start sensing this, and it will start to rally,&quot; he said.    Mr. Bostian also expects the dollar to continue its recent rise against the yen. That, he said, will encourage Japanese investors to increase their purchases of U.S. stocks and bonds.    Treasury Securities   Although U.S. Treasury bonds declined yesterday, they wound up the day near their session highs.    Dealers said they read very little into the session's results because activity was extremely light on the first day back from the Independence Day holiday. Moreover, traders said the trend in interest rates is likely to remain cloudy until Friday's report on U.S. employment in June.    The employment figures are watched especially closely by Fed officials. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is scheduled to outline the central bank's midyear economic and monetary outlook July 13.    The Treasury said yesterday it will sell $6.5 billion of seven-year notes Tuesday, as expected. In when-issued trading, the new seven-year notes were quoted late yesterday at 8.69%.    Several traders said a factor contributing to yesterday's bond market slump was a survey of U.S. industrial purchasing managers indicating that the economy's growth rate in June was the highest since December. Many investment managers fear the economy is growing too rapidly and that this will lead to higher inflation and increased interest rates.    An index of long-term Treasury issues, compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., fell 5.40 points to 1248.42. The low was 1244.42, and the high was 1249.35.    Among bellwether issues, the Treasury's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 fell to 102 20/32 yesterday from 103 2/32 Friday. The yield rose to 8.87% from 8.83%. The Treasury's latest 10-year notes declined to 101 7/32 from 101 16/32 Friday, while the yield rose to 8.81% from 8.77%.    The government sold new short-term Treasury bills yesterday at slightly lower rates than at last week's auction. The average rate on new 13-week bills declined to 6.57% from 6.59% last week, while the average on new 26-week bills dipped to 6.71% from 6.75%.    Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                 13-Week           26-Week    Applications ....... $37,555,425,000  $27,087,630,000    Accepted bids ......  $6,639,455,000   $6,600,845,000    Accepted at low price .......... 26%              95%    Accepted noncompet'ly $1,090,920,000   $1,108,940,000    Average price (Rate) . 98.339(6.57%)    96.608(6.71%)    High price (Rate) .... 98.342(6.56%)    96.623(6.68%)    Low price (Rate) ..... 98.339(6.57%)    96.608(6.71%)    Coupon equivalent ............ 6.77%            7.04%   Both issues are dated July 7. The 13-week bills mature Oct. 6, and the 26-week bills mature Jan. 5, 1989.   Municipals   State and local government bonds finished a lethargic session with small declines.   Among bellwether issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018 declined 1/8 of a point to 90 3/4.   Traders said activity was exceptionally quiet for the bulk of the session, mirroring the lack of action in the Treasury bond market. The weaker tone in the municipal market was set early in the day, largely as the result of declines in Treasury bond prices and concern that the recently strong U.S. dollar had weakened somewhat.   Adding to the nervousness in the municipal market lately has been speculation that Congress may impose additional restrictions on the issuance of new tax-exempt bonds in an effort to trim the nation's budget deficit.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities ended 1/8 to 1/4 point lower in light afternoon trading as yield spreads to Treasurys were little changed.   July Ginnie Mae 9% securities were quoted at 95 bid, down 6/32; 9 1/2% securities fell 8/32 to 97 3/4 bid; and 10% securities were down 4/32 to 100 5/8 bid.   The 10% issue was yielding 10.03% to a 12-year average life assumption. The yield spread to the 10-year Treasury note narrowed one basis point, to 122.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices finished little changed to off 1/8 point in light late trading.   No new issues came to market yesterday, but one issue was announced for probable pricing Wednesday. KfW International Finance Inc. plans to sell $300 million of 10-year guaranteed notes through First Boston Corp. KfW International is a unit of Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, which in turn is an instrumentality of West Germany. Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau was created in 1948 to distribute and lend funds under the Marshall Plan.   Foreign Bonds   Prices of foreign government bonds rose, with British and Japanese government issues leading the advance.   Analysts said the Japanese market was dominated once again by developments in the foreign exchange markets. Japanese government bonds were buoyed by the dollar's decline against the Japanese yen and speculation that the dollar will continue dropping in coming months.   The Japanese government's benchmark 5% No. 105 issue due 1997 rose to a price of 100.06, up 0.83 on the day, in the interdealer market. The yield fell 0.13 percentage point to 4.99%. The range was 4.96% to 5.145%.   In London, gilts surged by as much as 1 1/2 points, with traders citing the British pound's strong performance.   Analysts also said the gilt market was bolstered during the day by the Bank of England, which is believed to be keen to buy longer-dated bonds ahead of its next gilt auction. Others reported good buying early in the day from the Far East, triggered by both the recent rise in United Kingdom base rates and a steady performance by the pound against the yen.   The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 ended 1 1/2 points higher at 116 13/32 to yield 9.63%. Among shorter-term issues, the Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 rose 1/2 point to 104 6/32 to yield 9.81%, while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 climbed 1 3/32 point to 110 8/32 to yield 9.84%.   In West Germany, bond prices closed the afternoon interbank dealing session flat to slightly higher.   The government's 6 1/2% issue of 1998 closed interdealer trading at 99.05 bid, 0.05 point higher on the day, while the yield remained at about 6.63%.   Prices in the Euromark sector closed flat to 1/8 point higher. The European Investment Bank's 5 7/8% issue due 1998 ended 0.15 point higher than Monday at 98.20 bid.   Separately, seasoned Eurodollar bonds closed little changed, with prices of some issues perhaps 1/8 lower.</TEXT></DOC>
