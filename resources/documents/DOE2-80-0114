The object of this paper was to butt-weld 12mm thicknesskilled steel plate at 50 cm/min in a single pass by the MIG arc augmentedlaser welding method using a 5 kW CO{sub 2} laser welder. This conditionwas impossible to perform using a 400A MIG welder. A MIG welding gunwas inclined at 75{sup 0}C from the work surface with restrictive arrangementof the equipment. The effect of the relative configuration of MIG arcto the beam, the shape of groove, the focal position of the beam andetc. on the penetration depth was investigated. A sufficiently butt-weldedjoint was obtained under the condition to weld 12mm thickness steel plateswith a 7mm deep, 45{sup 0} V-shape groove (with 5mm root face) at 80cm/min,using 5 kW laser beam conbined with 400A MIG arc current.
