The banking company so far has resisted seeking a suitor or federal assistance, instead trying to raise about $200 million in fresh capital on its own. Unlike other large Texas banks, it has been able to sell assets, including its MTech Corp. data processing unit, helping it weather the economic troubles in Texas.    However, in its second-quarter report to shareholders, MCorp said there is a growing belief &quot;that private capital for Texas banks may be available only in combination with some form of public sector investment.&quot; In addition, it said its efforts to raise funds through a stock offering to institutions and corporate investors has been hurt by the well-publicized problems of other Texas banks.    An MCorp spokesman said MCorp is continuing to explore all financial alternatives. An FDIC spokesman said MCorp hasn't contacted it. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, MCorp closed at $1.25, down 25 cents.    For the six months, the banking concern had a loss from continuing operations of $231.7 million and a net loss of $12 million, including a $215.5 million gain from the sale of MTech and $4.2 million in profit from discontinued operations.    As previously reported, Gene H. Bishop, chairman and chief executive officer, said at the company's June annual meeting that it &quot;always has under advisement&quot; the possibility of turning to the FDIC if its financial condition deteriorates.    Federal regulators last month closed First RepublicBank Corp.'s 40 banks and turned them over NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C. The move wiped out First RepublicBank's shareholders and left bondholders to pick from the holding company's few remaining assets. The holding company has since sought bankruptcy-law protection. First RepublicBank isn't related to First Republic Bancorp. of San Francisco. </TEXT></DOC>
