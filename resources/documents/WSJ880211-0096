After being rescued from a sports stadium's dressing room where he had been held captive, the homeland's president, Lucas Mangope, said on television: &quot;I am back in control . . . thanks to the South African army.&quot;    The homeland is best known for its gambling, sports and entertainment center at Sun City. Reports from the South African-owned resort said the roulette wheels didn't miss a spin during the coup.    The invasion of Bophuthatswana is South Africa's first military intrusion into one of the black homelands created under the apartheid policy of institutionalized racial segregation. It illustrates South Africa's tight control over the 10 homelands, even over the four of them -- including Bophuthatswana -- that have accepted Pretoria's offer that they call themselves independent countries. Because of that control, no nation other than South Africa recognizes the homelands as independent.    The homelands get the bulk of their financing from South Africa and are totally reliant on South Africa for their foreign trade. Much of their labor force is employed in South Africa.    Before the South African invasion, Bophuthatswana's small military announced it was handing control of the country to Rocky Malebane-Metsing, whose People's Progressive Party was the official opposition to the homeland's long-serving president, Mr. Mangope. Among its reasons for the coup, the army said, were Mr. Mangope's close links with Shabtai Kalmanovitz, a businessman arrested in Israel on changes of spying for the Soviet Union.    South African President P. W. Botha told Parliament that he ordered troops into Bophuthatswana after the homeland's foreign minister, S.L. Rathebe, who together with other cabinet members was being sheltered in the South African Embassy in Mmabatho, the homeland's capital, had telephoned Pretoria seeking assistance.    The Bophuthatswana coup followed two coups late last year in the homeland of Transkei. In those coups, which were engineered by Transkei army leaders angered by allegations of government corruption, Pretoria remained neutral, saying it wouldn't interfere in the affairs of a sovereign country.    President Botha said yesterday that in Transkei's case, the legally elected head of state hadn't been deposed -- the target was an appointed prime minister -- and there hadn't been an appeal for South African assistance from the ousted government.    Bophuthatswana, which comprises seven land-locked enclaves scattered across northern South Africa, is a contrast of wealth and poverty. Just north of Pretoria, Sun City rises like a mirage from the plain. It plays host to the highest rollers in South Africa and recently held a $1 million golf tournament attended by professionals from around the world. Bophuthatswana is also one of the world's leading producers of platinum.    Beyond the glitter of Sun City, though, poverty is the norm. Most of the 1.5 million citizens live off subsistence agriculture, or travel to South Africa to work in the mines. </TEXT></DOC>
