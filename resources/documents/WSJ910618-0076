The so-called presidential checkoff system, which allowstaxpayers to earmark one of their tax dollars to help fundthe presidential campaign, could run out of money as early asnext year and will certainly be bankrupt by 1996. Decliningparticipation by taxpayers and the way the money is collectedare the primary culprits.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The issue is not if the fund will run out of money, butwhen,&quot; says John Warren McGarry, chairman of the FederalElection Commission.   The task of saving the system is being complicated by thelarger and heatedly partisan question of whether to expandpublic financing beyond the presidential level to includecongressional elections. Democrats want taxpayer subsidiesfor congressional campaigns as part of any campaign-financingoverhaul. Republicans don't, and are brandishing the woes ofthe presidential checkoff system as evidence of the failingsof public financing.   As a result, the fight over whether to rescue thepresidential system is looking more and more like areferendum on campaign financing in general. Failure tocorrect the problems of the checkoff system would be aleading indication that a bigger move toward public financingof congressional campaigns probably is doomed.   &quot;If we can't save this, we're just kidding ourselves aboutreforming the congressional system,&quot; says Democratic Rep. AlSwift of Washington state, chief sponsor of a bill designedto salvage the checkoff program and a supporter of publicfunding of congressional elections.   The presidential checkoff was enacted in 1974 in the wakeof the Watergate-era scandals. It was meant to discouragefuture abuses by curbing the role of special-interest money,and to limit overall spending in presidential campaigns bythose candidates who accept the federal dollars.   &quot;The fund is the linchpin that maintains the integrity ofour presidential-election system,&quot; asserts Susan Lederman,president of the U.S. League of Women Voters. &quot;It is not toomuch to say that this fund protects the integrity of thepresidency itself.&quot;   Since the 1976 presidential election, the fund hasdispensed nearly $500 million to candidates. While opponentsat the time it was created charged that it would encouragelarge numbers of fringe candidates, only a minuscule portionhas gone to such candidates as Lenora Fulani of the NewAlliance Party and Lyndon LaRouche, who has run under severalbanners. Meanwhile, only one of the 50 major-party candidatessince the system was begun, John Connolly of Texas, has everrefused the checkoff money.   Although disbursements from the checkoff reached $158.6million in 1988, up from $69.5 million in 1976, the checkoffitself has never varied. It remains $1 for individuals and $2for joint filers; collections, which had stagnated, haverecently declined. Annual receipts reached a high of $41million in 1981 and fell to a low of just more than $32million last year and the year before.   A major reason for the slump in receipts is a drop in thepercentage of taxpayers who voluntarily check off the box onthe income-tax form. Participation steadily declined throughthe 1980s, from a high of 28.7% in 1980 to 19.8% in 1989, thelast year for which data is complete.   Checkoff advocates assert that much of the decline inparticipation is because of ignorance of the program itself.For instance, many people don't realize that checking the boxon the income-tax form doesn't obligate them to pay any morein taxes, but simply designates a dollar to be paid into thefund from the tax already incurred.   Further, there's been little effort to educate the publicabout the system, leading experts to predict thatparticipation will continue to decline. &quot;As we move furtherand further away from the enactment of the law, thetax-paying public is going to have fewer and fewer peoplewith a firsthand recollection of the program and why it wasadopted,&quot; Mr. McGarry says. &quot;Only public education canreverse this trend.&quot;   An additional problem has been created by the Bushadministration's Treasury Department. The department hasdecided to set aside funds for the 1992 general election andthe party conventions before it frees up any money fordistribution to primary candidates. The effect could be atleast a temporary lack of funding for candidates in theprimaries.   The Treasury argues that the ruling is consistent with thepriorities for payment established by the law, and iscompletely devoid of political considerations. Advocates ofpublic financing argue otherwise. &quot;The proposed regulationsthreaten to tilt what has been a fair system in favor of anyincumbent president and any other presidential candidate whois able to raise significant campaign funds early in theprocess,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer, president of the &quot;citizenlobby&quot; Common Cause.   The problem for 1992 is small compared with the crisisthat looms for 1996. Experts agree that either more moneymust be collected or the fund simply will crumble. &quot;Thestructural flaw is so fundamental,&quot; Mr. McGarry says, &quot;thateven if participation increased to its highest previous rate,the fund would still run short in 1996.&quot;   Democrats are determined to fix what they see as wrongwith the system. Rep. Swift is pushing a bill that wouldincrease the checkoff for individuals to $3 and index theamount to the rate of inflation, rounding to the nearestdollar. The measure also would direct the Treasury todispense money during next year's primaries based on anestimate of the amount it expects to collect throughout theyear so that primary candidates aren't shortchanged. Asimilar measure is being concocted in the Senate.   Congressional Republicans are determined to fight anyrepair, and in fact would like to kill the entire system. TheRepublicans' point man on campaign finance in the Senate,Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has already tried twice thisyear to terminate the checkoff system. He argues that theprogram is loophole-ridden and, despite its spending limits,has failed to rein in the growth of presidential campaignspending. He also says low participation proves that publicfinancing is out of favor with the people.   &quot;I cannot think of a single federal program that has beenmore thoroughly and totally discredited than this one,&quot; Sen.McConnell says.   Democrats, though, charge an element of hypocrisy in theGOP protestations. &quot;It is ironic that the supporters of thisrepeal proposal are members of the political party whosepresidential candidates have repeatedly accepted publicfinancing even as they vocally reject public financing forother campaigns,&quot; says Oklahoma Democratic Sen.
