Results early today from voting to fill two vacant House ofCommons seats showed Labor holding on to the inner-city socialiststrongholds of Scotland's Glasgow Central and London's Vauxhalldistrict.   ``The government is in trouble,'' Labor campaign manager BryanGould declared. ``We have just started to see the beginning of amajor shift in the underlying political agenda.''   Labor tried to turn the European campaign into a referendum onMrs. Thatcher's 10 years in office.   Kenneth Clarke, Health Secretary in Mrs. Thatcher's government,blamed economic problems and the mid-term protest votes for theConservatives' apparent defeats.   ``But we've seen worse than this,'' said Clarke, arguing theConservatives would recover before the next general election, whichmust be held by mid-1992.   For her part, she told voters they should reject minimum-wage andother proposals of the European Economic Community that wouldintroduce ``socialism by the back door.''   The exit poll gave the tiny environmental Green Party third placein national voting for the first time.   Official results are not due until early Monday, when voting forthe 518-member body is complete in all 12 member nations of theEuropean Economic Community.   The computerized British Broadcasting Corp. poll of 7,500 votersshowed Labor with 44 percent of the European vote, its best showingin more than a decade. The Conservatives took 32 percent.   Those percentages would allow Labor to win 51 of 78 seatsallocated to the British mainland in the European Parliament, upfrom the party's previous 32. The government's tally dropped from 26from 45, according to the poll.   The Scottish National Party gained one seat, the poll said.   The Greens followed with 14 percent, according to the poll. Thecentrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party finished with 6percent, the poll said. Such percentages would not give either ofthose two parties any seats on the European body.   Minor parties captured the rest of the votes.   The poll was conducted for the BBC by National Opinion Poll.   In Vauxhall, Labor's Kate Hoey won with a 9,766-vote majority,slightly more than the 1987 general election. The Conservative votewas down 10 percent at 5,425 votes, only 382 ahead of the centristSocial and Liberal Democratic Party.   In Glasgow Central, Labor's majority slumped by nearly two-thirdsto 6,462, eroded by the Scottish National Party.   Laborite Michael Watson's 14,480 votes was a 10 percent drop,while the Scottish nationalist share was up 20 percent. TheConservatives ran third in the mainly working class district,getting 2,028 votes.   The by-elections were called after the death of the previousGlasgow Central legislator and the retirement of the one in Vauxhall.   Mrs. Thatcher's party retains a huge majority in the 650-memberHouse of Commons. The Conservatives have 375 seats, Labor 229, theSocial and Liberal Democrats 19, and the splinter Social DemocraticParty three. The Scottish nationalists have four seats, and minorityregional parties control the rest.   In his comments, Gould said the Conservatives were hurt by Mrs.Thatcher's resistance to greater European unity and her oftencombative stance in the trade bloc.   ``Now we see we are paying a price for Mrs. Thatcher pickingfights with everybody,'' said Gould.   In addition to benefiting from high interest rates of 14 percentand unemployment of 6.4 percent, Labor has also been helped by anew, more centrist platform. Its plan drops the party's previouscall for scrapping Britain's nuclear arsenal unilaterally andshutting down U.S. nuclear bases.</TEXT></DOC>
