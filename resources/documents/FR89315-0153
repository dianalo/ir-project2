This includes research performedby NIH directly. <ITAG tagnum="84">Introduction </ITAG>(1) Experiments in which recombinant DNA (See Footnote 1) is introducedinto cells of a human subject with the intent of stably modifying the subject'sgenome are covered by Section III-A-4 of the NIH Guidelines for ResearchInvolving Recombinant DNA Molecules (49 <T4>Federal Register</T4> 46266). Section III-A-4 requires such experimentsto be reviewed by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) andapproved by the NIH. RAC consideration of each proposal will be on a case-by-casebasis and will follow publication of a precis of the proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, an opportunity for public comment, and a reviewof the proposal by the working group of the RAC. RAC recommendations oneach proposal will be forwarded to the NIH Director for a decision whichwill then be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> In accordance with Section IV-C-1-b of the NIHGuidelines, the NIH Director may approve proposals only if he finds thatthey present ``no significant risk to health or the environment.'' (2) In general, it is expected that somatic-cell gene therapy protocolswill not present a risk to the environment as the recombinant DNA is expectedto be confined to the human subject. Nevertheless, Section I-B-4-b of the``Points to Consider'' document asks the researchers to address specificallythis point. (3) This document is intended to provide guidance in preparing proposalsfor NIH consideration under Section III-A-4 of the NIH Guidelines for ResearchInvolving Recombinant DNA Molecules. Not every point mentioned in the ``Pointsto Consider'' document will necessarily require attention in every proposal.The document will be considered for revision as experience in evaluatingproposals accumulates and as new scientific developments occur. This reviewwill be carried out at least annually. (4) A proposal will be considered by the RAC only after the protocol hasbeen approved by the local Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) andby the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with Departmentof Health and Human Services (DHHS) Regulations for the Protection of HumanSubjects (45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46). If a proposal involveschildren, special attention should be paid to subpart D of these DHHS regulations.The IRB and IBC may, at their discretion, condition their approval on furtherspecific deliberation by the RAC and its working group. Consideration ofgene therapy proposals by the RAC may proceed simultaneously with reviewby any other involved federal agencies (See Footnote 2) provided that theRAC is notified of the simultaneous review. Meetings of the committee willbe open to the public except where trade secrets or proprietary informationwould be disclosed. The committee would prefer that the first proposalssubmitted for RAC review contain no proprietary information or trade secrets,enabling all aspects of the review to be open to the public. The publicreview of these protocols will serve to inform the public not only on thetechnical aspects of the proposals but also on the meaning and significanceof the research. (5) The clinical application of recombinant DNA techniques to human genetherapy raises two general kinds of questions: (1) the questions usuallydiscussed by IRBs in their review of any proposed research involving humansubjects; and (2) broader social issues. The first type of question isaddressed principally in Part I of this document. Several of the broadersocial issues surrounding human gene therapy are discussed later in thisIntroduction and in Part II below. (6) Following the Introduction, this document is divided into four parts.Part I deals with the short-term risks and benefits of the proposed researchto the patient (See Footnote 3) and to other people, as well as with issuesof fairness in the selection of patients, informed consent, and privacyand confidentiality. In Part II, investigators are requested to addressspecial issues pertaining to the free flow of information about clinicaltrials of gene therapy. These issues lie outside the usual purview of IRBsand reflect general public concerns about biomedical research. Part IIIsummarizes other requested documentation that will assist the RAC and itsworking group in their review of gene therapy proposals. Part IV specifiesreporting requirements. (7) A distinction should be drawn between making genetic changes in somaticcells and in germ line cells. The purpose of somatic cell gene therapyis to treat an individual patient, e.g., by inserting a properly functioninggene into a patient's bone marrow cells in vitro and then reintroducingthe cells into the patient's body. In germ line alterations, a specificattempt is made to introduce genetic changes into the germ (reproductive)cells of an individual, with the aim of changing the set of genes passedon to the individual's offspring. The RAC and its working group will notat present entertain proposals for germ line alterations but will considerfor approval protocols involving somatic-cell gene therapy. (8) The acceptability of human somatic-cell gene therapy has been addressedin several recent public documents as well as in numerous academic studies.The November 1982 report of the President's Commission for the Study ofEthical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, SplicingLife, resulted from a two-year process of public deliberations and hearings;upon release of that report, a House subcommittee held three days of publichearings with witnesses from a wide range of fields from the biomedicaland social sciences to theology, philosophy, and law. In December 1984,the Office of Technology Assessment released a background paper, HumanGene Therapy, which brought these earlier documents up-to-date. As thelatter report concluded: ``Civic, religious, scientific, and medical groups have all accepted, inprinciple, the appropriateness of gene therapy of somatic cells in humansfor specific genetic diseases. Somatic cell gene therapy is seen as anextension of present methods of therapy that might be preferable to othertechnologies.'' (9) Concurring with this judgment, the RAC and its working group are preparedto consider for approval somatic-cell therapy protocols, provided thatthe design of such experiments offers adequate assurance that their consequenceswill not go beyond their purpose, which is the same as the traditionalpurpose of all clinical investigations, namely, to benefit the health andwell-being of the individual being treated while at the same time gatheringgeneralizable knowledge. (10) Two possible undesirable consequences of somatic-cell therapy wouldbe unintentional (1) vertical transmission of genetic changes from an individualto his or her offspring or (2) horizontal transmission of viral infectionto other persons with whom the individual comes in contact. Accordingly,this document requests information that will enable the RAC and its workinggroup to assess the likelihood that the proposed somatic-cell gene therapywill inadvertently affect reproductive cells or lead to infection of otherpeople (e.g., treatment personnel or relatives). (11) In recognition of the social concern that surrounds the general discussionof human gene therapy, the working group will continue to consider thepossible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained from these andrelated experiments. While research in molecular biology could lead tothe development of techniques for germ line intervention or for the useof genetic means to enhance human capabilities rather than to correct defectsin patients, the working group does not believe that these effects willfollow immediately or inevitably from experiments with somatic-cell genetherapy. The working group will cooperate with other groups in assessingthe possible long-term consequences of somatic-cell gene therapy and relatedlaboratory and animal experiments in order to define appropriate humanapplications of this emerging technology.(12) Responses to the questions raised in these ``Points to Consider''should be provided in the form of either written answers or referencesto specific sections of the protocol or its appendices.<ITAG tagnum="84">I.

Because the guidance in this notice coversnot only virtually every NIH program but also essentially every Federalresearch program in which DNA recombinant molecule techniques could beused, it has been determined to be not cost effective or in the publicinterest to attempt to list these programs. Such a list would likely requireseveral additional pages. In addition, NIH could not be certain that everyFederal program would be included as many Federal agencies, as well asprivate organizations, both national and international, have elected tofollow the NIH Guidelines.
