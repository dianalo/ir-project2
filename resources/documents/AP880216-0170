PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev criticizedBritain and other Western European countries Tuesday for what hecalled a lack of enthusiasm for the superpower agreement toeliminate intermediate-range missiles.   Gorbachev met with Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe ofBritain, who defended Britain's nuclear policy at a news conferencein the Soviet capital.   ``While generally approving the INF treaty, the leaders of NATOcountries have been acting as though the situation in Europe sinceits signing had only worsened,'' Gorbachev said, according to areport by the official Tass news agency.   ``Otherwise, it was impossible to explain the latest wave ofpraise for the `nuclear deterence' strategy, plans for so-called`compensation,' all manner of projects for the joint manufacture ofnewest weapons, the Franco-West German military rapprochment, andso forth,'' Gorbachev said.   The Soviet leader also said Britain had grown less enthusiasticabout a chemical weapons ban, and that the West was dragging itsfeet at a conference in Vienna to work out a format for new talkson conventional forces in Europe.   Gorbachev, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and otherSoviet officials regularly have criticized European leaders afterthe Dec. 8 superpower summit for urging the modernization of theirweapons systems to make up for the loss of U.S. Pershing 2 andcruise missiles in Europe.   In East Germany, the official news agency ADN reported Tuesdaythat the Soviets had begun dismantling intermediate nuclearmissiles.   Howe, at a news conference after his meeting with Gorbachev,defended Britain's policy of keeping and modernizing its nuclearforce.   ``Peace has indeed been upheld in the past 40 years by thenuclear deterrent,'' Howe said. ``The deterent resoures availableneed to be kept up to date, to be modernized.''   ``Modernization is not a euphemism for circumventing the INFtreaty,'' he added.   Gorbachev and President Reagan signed an agreement in Decemberto eliminate their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles fromEurope as well as the rest of the globe. The two sides now aretrying to negotiate a 50 percent cut in their arsenals oflong-range weapons.   The U.S.-Soviet agreement is awaiting U.S. Senate approval. Inthe Soviet Union, the treaty has been approved by the rulingCommunist Party and must be passed by the Supreme Soviet, which isexpected to give its endorsement.</TEXT></DOC>
