The nine-member court, however, said it would not instruct thelegislature what specific steps to take to correct the problem.   A state district judge had held the school finance systemunconstitutional in a case brought by poor school districts, manyof them largely Hispanic, against the state education commissionerand others.   That ruling was overturned last December by a 2-1 vote of theAustin-based 3rd Court of Appeals, but the high court upheld theplaintiffs today on the grounds that the constitution required an``efficient'' education system.   ``We hold that the state's school financing system is neitherfinancially efficient, nor efficient in the sense of providing fora `general diffusion of knowledge' statewide,'' Justice OscarMauzy's opinion said.   With an enrollment of 3.3 million, Texas has the second-largestpublic school system in the country after California.   Texas school districts with relatively low property valuesbrought the suit in 1984. As in most states, public schools inTexas are funded largely through a combination of local propertytaxes and state aid. Similar financing systems have been challengedin court in at least 10 other states.   The case is known as Edgewood vs. Kirby, from the leadplaintiff, Edgewood Independent School District in San Antonio, andlead defendant, William F. Kirby, commissioner of the TexasEducation Agency.   ``I'm still, I think, about 20,000 feet over San Antonio,''Edgewood Superintendent James Vasquez said after learning of theruling.   ``It's the end of a five-year struggle for me, personally, butit's the end of a 20-year struggle for the school district,'' hesaid.   Kirby was out of town to give a speech and could not immediatelybe reached for comment.   In its ruling, the court rejected arguments that reform inschool finance will eliminate local control, saying an efficientsystem does not mean an end to local control, ``only that the fundsavailable for education be distributed equitably and evenly.''   Mauzy's opinion said because the court had decided that thefinance system violated the constitution's efficiency requirement,it need not consider petitioners' other constitutional challengessuch as the argument that the present system is discriminatory.   Mauzy's opinion said the court would give the legislature untilMay 1, 1990, to come up with a remedy, because the court wanted toavoid ``any sudden disruption in the educational processes.''   ``Let there be no misunderstanding,'' the opinion said. ``Aremedy is long overdue. The legislature must take immediateaction.''   The legislature meets in special session Nov. 14. There was noimmediate response from Gov. Bill Clements on whether he would putschool financing on the agenda in the wake of the court's decision.   In the Legislature's regular session this spring, lawmakersapproved five education bills, including a plan to pump $450million in extra state aid to help equalize funding and provide apay raise for teachers.   But many of the poor districts complained the extra money wasnot nearly enough and many cities have been forced to raiseproperty taxes to pay for state-mandated education reforms.   In 1988, Comptroller Bob Bullock found that 730 of the state's1,100 school districts spend less than the statewide average of$3,290 per student per year.   The average in those districts was $2,976. In the wealthierdistricts, the average yearly expenditure was $4,268.   John T. Garcia, state director of the League of United LatinAmerican Citizens, the Hispanic civil rights organization, calledthe decision long overdue and ``a very bold step for the SupremeCourt.''   Texas is one of 11 states whose school financing systems havebeen challenged in court on the grounds of equity. In June, forexample, the Kentucky Supreme Court ordered that state'sLegislature to reorganize the state's public education programs.   Other states with active lawsuits or court orders concerningschool finance are Alaska, Connecticut, Indiana, Minnesota,Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon and Tennessee. Acoalition of poor Alabama districts says it will probably sue thatstate this fall.</TEXT></DOC>
