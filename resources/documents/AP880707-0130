In a television interview said to be the first with a Westernnetwork since his ouster as Communist Party chief, Dubcek calledthe invasion ``a heavy moral burden on our society.''   Dubcek, 66, lost his party post in April 1969 and was expelledfrom the party in June 1970.   Many economic and social reforms supported by Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev are similar to those Dubcek introduced 20years ago.   He now lives as a pensioner in virtual seclusion. Austriantelevision interviewed him as he worked in his garden atBratislava, the capital of Slovakia about 40 miles east of Vienna,dressed in an undershirt and shorts.   ``I welcome every positive step which is made for theapplication of Soviet restructuring under our conditions,'' theformer party chief said. ``Some people say we cannot use all that,but in the last 20 years the same people have copied everying (fromthe Soviet Union).''   When the late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev was in power,``we had to march the way Brezhnev ordered,'' Dubcek said.   ``Now the same people (Czech leaders) are very selective when itcomes to deciding what suits Czechoslovakia and what not,'' hesaid. ``There is a certain inconsistency in evaluating theexperience. I believe that what happens in the Soviet Union now iswell suited for our conditions.''   Dubcek deplored the fact that Kremlin reform ``unfortunatelycomes after 20 years.'' In those years, he said, ``the existingbackwardness has deepened, and that testifies to the fact that theinvasion was not right.''   Asked for comment on the recent Communist Party conference inMoscow, Dubcek said: ``I was always firmly convinced that ...Gorbachev's leadership will prevail. The conference has confirmedthat and I am happy about it.''   Dubcek chided Western officials, who he said believe it is agood thing ``if socialism ares badly.''   On the contrary, he said, ``it is better for Western democraciesif the Soviet leadership finally and radically distances itselffrom Stalinist militarism and departs from Brezhnev's dogmatism.''</TEXT></DOC>
