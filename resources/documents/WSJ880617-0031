The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a department unit, said the new regulations, which go into effect in 60 days, could also prevent 7,000 injuries a year among the 3.8 million construction workers the rules will cover. These include any worker at a site where masonry or concrete construction work is in progress.    The new standards are part of an OSHA effort to improve a wide range of its worker health and safety rules, many of which haven't been modified substantially since OSHA was formed in 1971, said John Pendergrass, an assistant secretary of labor for OSHA. The current masonry and concrete rules were based on recommendations by the American National Standards Institute in 1970, and changes in those rules since then have often confused construction firms, Mr. Pendergrass said.    The new standards will broaden and strengthen some rules, but will give employers more flexibility in meeting OSHA safety requirements, making it easier and less costly to protect workers, the agency said.    Complying with the rules will cost the 250,000 construction firms affected a total of $43.8 million a year, OSHA estimated, but will save $348 million annually in reduced lost worktime, workmen's compensation costs, insurance premiums and property damage.    Most of the companies are small businesses, and the maximum cost to each was estimated at $340 a year.    The standards will expand and toughen protection against masonry-wall collapses by requiring added bracing and a zone in which worker access is limited before the wall can be built. Construction firms will also be allowed to use some recently developed methods for testing concrete.    The new rules also establish or clarify most requirements for handling concrete cast during construction or pre-cast concrete.    Upgrading of the requirements for so-called &quot;lift-slab&quot; construction method, however, will be done later this year, OSHA said. In that method, large slabs to be used as building floors are lifted to the level where they are installed. Blaming faulty lift-slab methods, OSHA has proposed $5 million in fines for contractors involved in the L'Ambiance Plaza apartment complex in Bridgeport, Conn., which collapsed last year, killing 28 people. </TEXT></DOC>
