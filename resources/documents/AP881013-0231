He was referring to frequentcomplaints by U.S. officials that too much of the burden ofprotecting West Europe falls on the U.S. military.   Kohl said, ``The achievement of a European concept in securitypolicies ... with the goal of achieving a common European defensein close partnership with the United States ... is among our mostimportant duty for the future.''   Signs are emerging that this is already happening, he said,pointing to a West German-French agreement to form a joint defensebrigade. But he said more needs to be done.   ``We must get going with the step-by-step realization of acommon European defense _ and if possible, even if it doesn't comeuntil the end of this path, a European army.''   Kohl also said he favors creation of a ``European federalpolice'' to combat terrorism and drug crimes.   Kohl was addressing a West Berlin conference of the AspenInstitute, an American think tank.</TEXT></DOC>
