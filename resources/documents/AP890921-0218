DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal agency that polices the commoditymarkets has been called a snoozing watchdog since scores of Chicagotraders were indicted for fraud this summer, but its top cop saysthe charges show the system works.   ``You wouldn't have had the results you had without ourinvolvement in this,'' said Dennis Klejna, enforcement chief of theCommodity Futures Trading Commission.   Klejna reluctantly agreed to an interview to talk aobut the workof the commission, which is under congressional review forreauthorization of its authority. It faces extraordinary scrutinypartly because of a major fraud scandal in the freewheelingcommodity pits of Chicago.   More than 40 traders and brokers at the Chicago Board of Tradeand the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were indicted in August, theresult of a 2{-year undercover investigation in which FBI agentsposing as traders taped conversations.   To congressional critics, the scope of the indictments suggestedthat the defendants had used the commodity pits as their personalprofiteering club and that the commodity commission had been lax indetecting and stopping it.   ``Yes, a lot of people were indicted,'' Klejna said. ``I guesspeople can say that's a large number and there may be more _potentially _ we don't know that yet, or at least we're not going tocomment on it.''   But Klejna (pronounced CLAY-neh) said the Chicago indictments``should not be seen as a sign of weakness but rather as a sign ofstrength.''   The commodity commission is an independent agency that oversees13 futures markets in Chicago, New York and other cities, much likeits sister agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, whichoversees the stock and bond markets.   While it considers the exchanges and their rules as the firstline of defense against fraud, the commodity commission isresponsible for keeping the futures markets fair.   Klejna, a 42-year-old lawyer with prematurely gray hair, knowsabout that strength first hand. He has been with the commissionalmost from its creation by Congress in 1974.   He was an officer with the Army's Judge Advocate General Corpswhen he read about a new federal agency seeking lawyers.   A 1971 law school graduate from Fordham University in his nativeNew York, Klejna joined the commission as a staff attorney in August1976 and rose to special counsel in 1978, deputy director ofenforcement in 1981 and director since April 1983.   This past week, he was one of several senior federal agencyexecutives who received the presidential award for distinguishedservice.   ``Fiscal year 1989 was one of the most challenging and activeyears in the history of the commission,'' the agency's 1991 budgetproposal for Congress says. But to Klejna, ``they're always busyyears.''   To get to his sixth floor office in downtown Washington, visitorsmust thread through a maze of receptionist desks and crowdedcomputer work stations that suggest the commission is outgrowing itsspace.   Klejna's corner office reveals little of the man who oversees thecommodity police force. There is a large desk and table, some chairsand an American flag in one corner. Two works of art decorate awall, both of them framed posters _ one from the American BalletTheater.   Among the many undisclosed details of the Chicago probe iswhether the commission uncovered the wrongdoing first and alertedthe FBI or vice versa. The commission has no criminal authority andcan seek only civil sanctions for trading violations, tapping itsenforcement staff of 140, half of them lawyers.   ``I do think you could say they are attempting an enormous jobwith inadequate resources and that there is no question of theintegrity and concientiousness of that division,'' said AltonHarris, a prominent Chicago lawyer and expert on securities andcommodities regulation.   ``Having said that, however, I think there are substantialquestions as to whether they have their priorities properlyaligned,'' Harris said. A number of market problems, he said, ``arebest left to rule-making procedures and interpretative guidancerather than enforcement or disciplinary actions.''   That sentiment seems to be shared by several commodities lawyers.   Just a few weeks before the indictments were announced, Klejnawas a panelist at an American Bar Association function in Chicago.   ``And not one, but two defense lawyers that were on that paneltalked about how trading abuses had gone on all the time and what'sthe big deal,'' Klejna said.   He said the lawyers also questioned the appropriateness ofprosecuting traders for what had been seen in the past asessentially ``parking ticket'' violations.   But to Klejna, they are still illegal.   In July, Klejna announced that a New York-based commodity futurestrading concern and three affiliates had agreed to pay a record $4million to settle allegations of fraud in cocoa contracts.   This year Klejna also concluded what he called the largestanti-fraud sales solicitation case the commission ever brought, withlawsuits against two commodity options firms.   They were accused of misleading customers on investment risksthat ran up millions of dollars in losses over five years while thefirms took hefty sales commissions.   Klejna has appeared uncomfortable in the glare of televisionlights. His voice trails off behind a thicket of microphones and hemasks emotion with a stern face.   Despite his ill ease with publicity, Klejna says it will beworthwhile if he shows ``the high level of commitment andprofessionalism from the enforcement program at this agency, whichhas been doing its job all along.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Sept. 24</NOTE></DOC>
