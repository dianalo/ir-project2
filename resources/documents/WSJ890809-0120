The hares are the storybook entrepreneurs racing for the big kills. The tortoises, of course, are the plodding, cautious, buy-and-hold crowd.    Stripped of bells, whistles and partisan political maneuvering, the basic choice lawmakers face is whether to cut the tax rate on capital gains or instead to tax only those gains exceeding inflation, an approach called &quot;indexing.&quot;    &quot;A rate cut benefits the hares,&quot; says Joel Slemrod, a University of Michigan economist. &quot;Indexing benefits the tortoises.&quot;    Democrats like House Speaker Thomas Foley figure there are more tortoises than hares. They favor indexing. Bush administration officials like Budget Director Richard Darman say that, for the good of the economy, the hares deserve the break. These officials prefer lower tax rates on capital gains.    Of course, the current choice facing a Congress that appears headed for some sort of capital-gains tax reduction isn't a clean one between indexing and a lower tax rate.    With the backing of President Bush and other Republicans, Rep. Ed Jenkins (D., Ga.) would cut tax rates on capital gains -- and switch to indexing sometime in the future. In response, House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenskowski (D., Ill.) proposes to go to indexing immediately -- but offer a carrot to those venture capitalists with patience. Rep. Jenkins would reward all investors, no matter when they made their investment; Rep. Rostenkowski would only reward new investment. Neither plan would affect investments made by corporations. The Jenkins plan, which has attracted support from five other Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee, would cut the top tax bite on capital gains to 19.6% -- but only for the next 2 1/2 years. After that, he would raise it to 28% but introduce indexing. Capital gains, or profits from the sale of assets, currently are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, as much as 33% for many taxpayers.    In response, Rep. Rostenkowski last week proposed to leave the rate unchanged -- but to begin indexing immediately for new investments. He also would offer an alternative intended to appeal to the administration's wish to reward entrepreneurs: If they hold their assets for five years, they could pay tax on 75% of the sale price regardless of the actual profit; after 10 years, they could pay tax on 50% of the sales price. This option would appeal only to investors with enormous profits, like those who sink money into start-up companies that succeed.    The business lobby, including venture capitalists, remains solidly behind Rep. Jenkins for several reasons. The biggest one is that they want a cut in capital-gains taxes to apply to existing investments as well as new ones. &quot;In the venture-capital industry, we've got thousands of investments that we've made over the last 10 years,&quot; says Ted McCourtney, president of the National Venture Capital Association.    This points up another split among advocates of a capital-gains tax cut. One group, including some key Bush administration officials, is most interested in shaping a capital-gains tax cut so it increases incentives for new investment. They focus almost exclusively on the broad economic impact of any change. They care only about the future.    The other group, including business lobbyists and some congressmen, talks about the future, but looks also to the past. They're pressing for a tax break for investments already made. Unable to find any economic logic for this position, they argue for fairness: &quot;Why should we penalize those savers who have done the best thing for the U.S. economy?&quot; asks the American Council for Capital Formation. But pressing for lower capital-gains taxes on the grounds of fairness is always difficult since most of the benefits go to the rich.    Indexing long has been attractive to those who strive to make the tax system as fair and economically rational as possible. If an investor simply matches the inflation rate, they reason, he really has no gain at all. &quot;If you're not making gains, why should you pay taxes on them?&quot; says Alan Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania. Adds Mr. Slemrod: &quot;It's an attempt to measure income correctly.&quot;    Some fans of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, who hold tight to the principle that all income should be taxed alike, lean toward the indexing alternative because they so strongly oppose distinguishing between income from wages and income from the sale of stock. Although he hasn't taken a position on indexing, Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), a major force behind tax overhaul, is already distributing buttons that say: &quot;No New Loopholes.&quot;    Now Speaker Foley and Rep. Rostenkowski have embraced indexing as the populist route to reducing capital-gains taxes. They have realized that the benefits of indexing are shared by more people than simply cutting rates. The most successful investors are better off with lower rates. But on average, investors earn only a few percentage points more than inflation.    Congressional tax analysts estimate that taxpayers who earn more than $200,000 a year are better off with lower rates; the rest are better off with indexing. Eugene Steurle, a former Treasury tax analyst, says unpublished Treasury studies of 1981 tax returns show that taxpayers in middle-income brackets benefit more from indexing than from a cut in the tax rate. Rich people, not surprisingly, tend to be more successful investors and are more willing to make risky investments that pay off handsomely, he says. &quot;Equity arguments tend to favor indexing,&quot; he says.    Even some fans of indexing, though, find this a weak argument. &quot;There's no way any kind of capital-gains tax reduction is going to be anything but a benefit for upper-income people,&quot; says Mr. Auerbach. &quot;Maybe with indexing, it will be a little less so. Not the top 1%, but the top 5% will get most of the benefit.&quot;    And a few economists warn that indexing, for all its intellectual appeal, could actually encourage inflation. &quot;If you accommodate inflation,&quot; argues Harvard University economist Lawrence Summers, &quot;you eliminate the political pressures that would be brought to bear to mitigate inflation.&quot;    A more widely held objection to indexing is that it doesn't do enough to encourage and reward investment in risky, entrepreneurial ventures. &quot;Indexing is sort of a quarter of a loaf,&quot; says Edward Zschau, a former congressman who is now chairman of Censtor Corp., a San Jose, Calif., start-up electronics company. &quot;It is fairer than the current setup. But in order to inspire patient, long-term risk capital, you have to go further.&quot;    To an investor who anticipates returns of 30% or more, a change in the tax law that allows him to escape taxes on the first four or five percentage points of profit isn't much incentive. That's all that indexing by itself would offer.    &quot;We want something that would also reward the true job creators and innovators, the risk-takers and sweat-equity people who are key to keeping America No. 1,&quot; Mr. Darman said last week, explaining why the administration is pressing for something more than indexing.    Some economists see all the talk about venture capitalists as little more than a screen behind which advocates of capital-gains tax cuts hide for respectability.    Venture capitalists, for all the attention they get, represent a small proportion of all investors, they argue. Venture Economics, a Needham, Mass., firm, estimates that only 11% of the money committed to venture-capital pools last year came from individuals; most of the rest came from pension funds, college endowments and other institutions that don't pay taxes. (The numbers don't include investments entrpreneurs make in their own companies, but that's a small part of the total.) &quot;It's a big mistake to let the venture-capitalist tail wag the whole dog,&quot; Mr. Summers says.    Besides, says John Makin, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a fan of indexing, &quot;If you're talking about the risk-taker and the entrepreneur who hopes to make 25% or 30% return . . . they're not really all that worried about taxes.&quot;    ---@ Capital-Gains Taxes: Current and Proposed @ CURRENT LAW -- Capital gains are taxed at the same rate as other income, a maximum effective rate of 33%. @ ORIGINAL BUSH PLAN -- Cut top tax rate on capital gains to15% on assets held more than one year. After 1993, assets must be held for two years to qualify; after 1995, three years. Applies to securities and land, but not to other real estate, timber or collectibles. @ JENKINS PLAN -- (now endorsed by Bush) Cut tax rate on capital gains on assets held more than a year to 19.6% for the richest taxpayers if sold before the end of 1991. Boost the top rate to 28% after that, but only tax gains in excess of the inflation rate. Applies to most assets except collectibles. @ ROSTENKOWSKI PLAN -- Keep the tax rate unchanged but only tax gains in excess of inflation for assets purchased after July 31, 1989. But for assets held more than five years, taxpayer could choose to pay tax on 75% of sale price regardless of actual gain; for assets held more than 10 years, on 50% of sale price. Applies to corporate stock, real estate and timber, but not preferred stock, bonds, stock in foreign corporations or intangibles such as trademarks. </TEXT></DOC>
