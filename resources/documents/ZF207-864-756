by Karen Frenkel(Communications, Apr. 1989, pp.andP;  426-435) is timely and its spirit is veryappropriate for the non-specialist, we have strong misgiving about it for tworeasons.andP;  The first is policy related, and the second is scientific.andP;  Ourcomments relate to volume rendering as applied to medical 3D(three-dimensional) imaging, since our own interest is in medical imaging.andO;Prior to stating our concerns, we wish to summarize our perception of volumerendering and surface rendering.andM;Both of the methodologies start with a three-dimensional array of values andproduce a two-dimensional image based on this array.andP;  Unavoidably, there willbe a great deal of data reduction and, hence, a loss of information.andP;  Theimportant issue is how to do the rendering so that (medically) relevantinformation is retained.andM;Surface renderers do this via a special preprocessing step: some methods orother (not necessarily a simple one such as thresholding) surfaces of theobjects that are represented in the three-dimensional array are determinedand are displayed by more-or-less standard computer graphics techniques.andO;Volume renderers project onto the display screen the whole three-dimensionalarray, possibly, also after some preprocessing.andP;  Since the preprocessing may,indeed, be surface detection, the image that is produced by a surfacerenderer can always be produced by a volume renderer.andM;As far as discussing the relative usefulness of the images themselves, therecan only be a dispute if volume rendering is used in a mode other thansurface rendering.andP;  It is indeed such a mode that is discussed in Frenkel'sarticle:andM;the particular volume-rendering methodology is one which somehow blendstogether into a single color for a pixel on the display screen informationfrom all volume elements encountered by a line emanating from this pixel.andO;The volume elements of the three-dimensional array are assigned colors andopacities (based on their original values) and the renderer does a&quot;volumetric compositing.&quot;andM;In common with the article, we use below the phrase &quot;volume rendering&quot;specifically to mean this approach.andM;We feel that it should be counter to the policies of a reputed journal suchas Communications to publish an editorial article which is an uncriticalpartisan presentation of one methodology where others exist for the samepurposes.andP;  To make matters worse, the article does not even give anyreferences to the literature, which deprives the already misled readers of achance to get a balanced view.andP;  We consider that the validity of the claim,stated in the article as fact, of the superiority of volume rendering oversurface rendering in medical imaging is neither obvious nor has beenestablished scientifically.andP;  We, therefore, consider that statements in itare at best opinions, at worst untrue, and, in any case, controversial atpresent.andM;In addition, the general impression of the history of rendering volumetricmedical images provided by the article is false; the implication of thearticle is that medical 3D imaging came into being because of the developmentof volume rendering.andP;  In fact, medical 3D imaging predates volume rendering;see, for example, the 1970 paper of Greenleaf [6].andP;  Even the history ofvolume rendering is essentially incomplete in Frankel's article.andP;  The firstpublished volume-rendering technique that we are aware of is due to Harris[8] who suggested the idea of mixing densities or information derived fromdensities to create volume renditions more than a decade ago.andP;  We have nodoubt that the recent volume renderers are more sophisticated than thetechnique of Harris, but the fact is that the essence of the idea is due tohim rather than to the people listed in Frankel's article.andP;  Now we discussscientific matters.andM;The article asserts that, philosophically, surface rendering is lessappropriate than volume rendering in medical imaging because the formertechniques &quot;assume that a thin surface, suspended in air, accuratelyrepresents the original volume, but often data are taken from volumescontaining fluids and tissues that interface and form local mixes.andP;  Theyabsorb and emit light differently, information which is lost if the data arereduced to shell-like surfaces.&quot;andP;  We find this assertion objectionable forthe following reasons.andP;  The information that is sought after variesconsiderably in medical imaging from application to application.andP;  It isusually not the case that the physician analyzes all types of tissue withinthe region of the body for which data are gathered.andP;  Quite often the externalshape of a particular organ system is all that is of interest.andP;  It makesperfect sense to attempt to estimate where surfaces lie, since moststructures within the body have tangible boundaries which the surgeonactually encounters during a surgical procedure.andP;  Just by itself, thephilosophy adopted in surface rendering does not make it an inferior depictorof structure compared to volume rendering.andP;  Surface renderers do not assumethat an entire volume can be represented by a surface; rather, they operateon the priciple that there are identifiable objects inside the human body andthat these are appropriately represented by their surfaces.andP;  The usefulnessof surface rendering in a variety of medical applications has beenestablished by a number of independent critical studies (e.g., [1, 4, 7,16]).andP;  The philosophy of surface rendering makes sense for other reasons too.andO;There are establish theories of vision which, based on known results in humanvision from fields ranging from neuro-physiology to psychophysics, have ledto computational frameworks for vision that assume that &quot;the visible worldcan be regarded as being composed of smooth surfaces having reflectancefunctions whose spatial structure may be elaborate&quot; [11].andM;Frenkel's article implies that volume rendering has more precision and isless prone to artifacts that surface rendering.andP;  To us this is by no meansobvious.andP;  While we have heard similar opinions expressed prior to thearticle, we have not yet seen a scientifically acceptable validation of sucha hypothesis.andP;  The notions of precision and artifact are very complicated andcannot be treated in a general fashion independent of specific applicationsand observers.andP;  An artifact in the signal processing sense is not necessarilya medically relevant artifact.andP;  How well the tissue types of interest areidentified--an operating generally referred to as classification--is vital toboth surface and volume methods.andP;  Given the same degree of success inclassification for both surface and volume rendering, it is not clear thateither method is better than the other as far as the portrayal of medicallyuseful information is concerned.andM;The article conveys that natural objects such as internal organs do not lendthemselves to geometry-based description.andP;  This completely contradicts ourexperience.andP;  Though surfaces of medical objects are continuous and smooth,they can be modeled and rendered remarkably well using a large number ofdiscrete surface elements [2, 5, 9, 10, 12], see Figures 1-2.andP;  Though thegeometry of the modeled surface is discrete, the shape of the originalcontinuous surface can be portrayed accurately so as to show fine detailssuch as the sutures on a human skull via a combination of techniques forobject interpolation and for estimating normals to the continuous surface inthe vicinity of points on the discrete surface.andP;  It is medically notnecessary that a fine structure such as a suture be modeled with absoluteaccuracy (meaning represented precisely in the geometry of the discretesurface).andP;  All we need is that the corresponding feature in the geometricsurface should lie in close vicinity of the underlying real structure.andO;Appropriate normal estimation procedures [2] guided by the discrete geometryand the original data can make up for deficiencies due to classification.andO;Further, data structures representing such surfaces have far fewer elementsand require, typically, an order of magnitude less storage than those used torepresent the three-dimensional data set in volume rendering.andP;  In addition,since for both methods of rendering the number of elements to be addressedwhile producing a single image is of the same order of magnitude as the totalnumber of elements in the data structure, once preprocessing is completed,typically much less computational work needs to be done by a(special-purpose) volume renderer than by a (more general-purpose) volumerenderer.andP;  Modeling objects and surfaces in such a discrete fashion isdesirable for reasons beyond rendering: it allows us access to powerfulresults from mathematical topology which can be applied to the study ofobjects and their surfaces in the discrete environment through thedevelopment of appropriate theories [5, 9, 10, 12, 13].andM;Visualization is only one aspect of a complete ability to analyze volumetricdata.andP;  Mensuration [14] and interactive manipulation of structures (such ascutting out a segment of the object and relocating it) are essentialcapabilities in a variety of applications such as surgical planning [3, 15].andO;These are, at present, possible only with structure-oriented approaches suchas surface rendering.andM;In summary, much remains unknown about the relative merits of volume andsurface techniques for visualization in medical imaging.andP;  Both of thesemethodologies are exciting areas of research, and, in some sense, theycomplement each other.andP;  For example, when the object to be visualized is notwell-defined (e.g., a diffused tumor), volume rendering, in principle, seemsto be more appropriate than surface rendering; but, the medical efficacy ofsuch a display will depend on how opacities and colors are assigned to datapoints.andP;  On the other hand, for the display of tangible objects, ahigh-quality surface renderer may well be preferred to any currentlyavailable volume renderers since it is likely to be computationally lessexpensive and yet provide better capabilities for mensuration and forinteractive manipulation.andP;  We are confident that medical imaging well greatlybenefit from the development of both volume and surface rendering in theyears to come.andP;  Jayaram K.
