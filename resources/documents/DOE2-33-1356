However,these calculations may significantly overestimate exposure and may notprovide a clear understanding of the uncertainty in the analysis. Theuse of Monte Carlo modeling techniques can provide a better understandingof the potential range of exposures and the likelihood of high (worst-case)exposures. This paper compares the results of standard exposure estimationtechniques with the Monte Carlo modeling approach. The authors discussthe potential application of this approach for demonstrating regulatorycompliance, along with the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.Suggestions on implementing this method as a routine tool in exposureand risk analyses are also presented. 16 refs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
