MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Now that there's a war on, politicians who wantto cut federal programs or change priorities are going to be tryingto wrap their proposals in the banner of the fight against drugs.   That worked first time out, with Senate approval of an amendmentto cut spending for postage-free mailings to constituents. The GOPalready was on that case, complaining about the steady expansion ofthe free mail franking privilege, which works to the advantage ofincumbents seeking new terms.   The amendment passed the Senate easily, 83-9, on Thursday. But itwill be a hard sell in negotiations with the House, whereRepublicans are trying to make incumbency an issue against themajority Democrats who have dominated the place for 35 years.   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson of California, who is running forgovernor next year, sponsored the amendment shifting $45 millionfrom free mail to a program for drug-addicted mothers and theirbabies. That would leave about $35 million for franked congressionalmail if the House went along.   The numbers don't make a dent in the $7.9 billion President Bushwants spent on the drug war, a sum Democratic leaders argue is toolow. Wilson said it was almost symbolic.   Democrats will be back with their own arguments in favor of cutsand shifts in administration-proposed spending, especially ondefense, contending the money should be used against drugs.   The administration proposes to get additional funds for the drugwar by shifting $751 million from other programs, most of themdomestic. Democratic leaders have said the drug crisis couldincrease pressures for a tax increase, a step Bush rejects. ``Idon't think we have to think of the war on drugs as a war on thetaxpayer,'' said drug policy adviser William J. Bennett. ``I don'tthink anybody thinks that the reason we have a drug problem in thiscountry is that taxes are too low.''   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the cut in freemail privileges would send a signal ``that we are not going to behypocrites on the drug issue.   ``If the critics want a down payment on the war on drugs, votefor this amendment,'' he said. ``It is only $45 million, but that isa start. We only need to find $740 million more.''   Wilson's amendment would eliminate financing for masscongressional mailings to constituents. Senators and representativesnow can send newsletters and the like to every address in theirstate or district, two times a year for senators, four times forHouse members. There's no limit on the size of each missive.   Members of Congress still could send free mail addressed by name.But they couldn't send franked mail addressed to occupant or postalpatron.   Dole said the measure was a way for Congress to enlist in the waron drugs and do it with a sacrifice. ``These funds will come out ofour budgets, out of our pockets for a change,'' he said. Dole saidthere's too much congressional junk mail anyhow.   While it was a Republican amendment, stiffest opposition camefrom Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who argued that a lot of hisconstituents are isolated, can't get daily newspapers, and get theirinformation about Washington from his newsletter and others.   But it was a losing argument, not only because of the drug warbut also against the complaints of reformers about congressionalmass mailing _ and Senate resentment against the House, which spendsa lot more money on them. The House had voted $124.5 million forfree mailings in its version of the legislative appropriations bill.A conference committee will have to negotiate a settlement betweenthe two bills. It is not likely to settle on a cut nearly as drasticas the Wilson amendment.   In the House, Rep. John G. Rowland, a Republican opponent of theB-2 stealth bomber, said he will propose a bill this week to cancelmore than $1 billion in appropriations for the costly warplane andput that money into the drug war.   That won't be done. But it is the kind of cut that will beproposed often in the weeks ahead as evidence of a commitment to thedrug war.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
