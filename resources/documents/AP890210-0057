The president's budget message Thursday night was long on pledgesof concern for environmental protection, and contained a number ofinitiatives:   _Re-examination of offshore oil drilling projects in Florida andCalifornia.   _$206 million worth of new recreation land acquisitions.   _$120 million in fiscal 1990 to curb acid rain through the CleanCoal Technology Program, roughly $25 million more than proposed bythe Reagan administration.   _A $64 million increase for coordinated federal water qualityprograms in four agencies.   _Stricter enforcement and fines on producers of hazardous waste,but no Superfund money for toxic waste cleanup beyond the $175million increase outlined in Reagan's fiscal l990 budget submittedlast month.   Bush left several specifics unanswered, and he failed to back offone of the environmental community's top priorities _ oilexploration in the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.   Representatives of several environmental groups said they wereinclined to welcome the improvement over former President Reagan'sproposal, but were wary of vague wording.   ``Reagan was so abysmal that it's making it easier for Bush tocome across as an environmentalist,'' said Ben Beach, spokesman forthe Wilderness Society.   One of the most positive proposals from the environmentalists'point of view was the postponement of lease sales for oil drillingoff Northern and Southern California and Southern Florida pendingreview of environmental effects by a task force Bush will set up.   Under Reagan, preparations for leasing were already under way inall three areas Bush singled out. The former Texas oilman said he iscommitted to continuing the sale of oil and natural gas leases ifthey are ``prudent and environmentally sound.''   The president said lease sales along the California coast northfrom Mendocino County, which were scheduled for later this year,would be ``indefinitely postponed'' as would a sale off southernFlorida.   Lease sales for tracts scattered off Southern California from SanLuis Obispo to the Mexican border, scheduled for l990, also would bedelayed pending task force review.   ``Should the task force report indicate significant adverseenvironmental effects that have not been previously identified, adecision will be made to delay further or cancel the sale,'' Bush'sbudget message said.   That brought criticism from Michael Fischer, director of theSierra Club, who said the environmental hazards are alreadysufficiently documented to block drilling.   He also said if Bush does not see enough environmental reasons tokeep the Arctic refuge from being leased, ``There ought to be nocause for relaxation on the part of Californians'' trying to protecttheir coastline.   David Hawkins, air quality specialist for the National ResourcesDefense Council, said Bush did not specify specific tonnage ofemissions to be decreased when he called for ``significantreductions'' in industrial emissions that cause the problem.Arguments on that point have been central to blocking a solution toacid rain.   He also said an emphasis on clean coal efforts and innovationscould distract from timely removal of acid rain pollutants from theair, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
