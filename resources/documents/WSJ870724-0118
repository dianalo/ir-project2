The board's action put to rest months of offers and counteroffers from three investment groups interested in acquiring the Colorado Springs, Colo.-based sugar maker. The directors agreed to the acquisition by Arcanum I Partners, a group that includes Holly's chairman, Michael Buchsbaum.    But outsiders said the maneuvering to take control of the company might not be over. &quot;The bid is disappointing from the point of view of the public shareholders,&quot; said Donald Cassidy, an analyst with Denver-based Boettcher andamp; Co. &quot;There are two questions now. One: What will the other bidders do? And two: Will shareholders fight it?&quot;    Under the buyout plan, Arcanum would pay $40 in cash plus a $90 11.5% convertible subordinated debenture for each of the Holly shares it doesn't already own. No interest is to be paid on the debentures for the first five months after the closing of the transaction. Through the third anniversary of the closing, interest may be paid in additional debentures at a premium over the interest, were it paid in cash. After the third anniversary, interest is to be paid in cash. Arcanum I Partners owns 94,600 of Holly's 1,121,493 shares outstanding.    Mr. Cassidy estimated that the value of the offer -- figuring that the debentures may trade at a value of 80 cents on the dollar -- is about $112 a share. He said a &quot;fair&quot; price &quot;based on the cash flow and assets they have&quot; would be $120 to $125 a share.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Holly closed at $100.375 a share, down $2.    Holly didn't immediately return phone calls seeking comment. Neither did Brookehill Equities Inc. or Shamrock Holdings of California Inc., the two other groups that bid for Holly earlier this year. Holly, however, said in a news release that Brookehill had withdrawn its offer and &quot;supported the (Arcanum) merger agreement.&quot;    In June, Brookehill, a New York brokerage and investment firm, offered $70 a share in cash and $40 a share in securities, consisting of junior subordinated debt or cumulative exchangeable preferred stock, or a combination of both. Brookehill said then that it held about 12.6% of Holly's stock.    Shamrock, a Burbank, Calif.-based investment firm controlled by members of the Roy E. Disney family, had offered $45 a share in cash, a certificate called a &quot;stub&quot; that would pay as much as $70 over 20 years, and either a share of preferred stock valued at $70 or an increasing-rate debenture valued at $35. In April, Shamrock said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it held a 9% stake in Holly.    Holly said in its news release yesterday that Arcanum had told the board that the investor group is &quot;highly confident&quot; it can get an $80 million credit facility from National Westminster Bank USA to help finance the buyout. Holly also said it can cancel the buyout agreement if Arcanum doesn't receive a commitment for the loan by Aug.7. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    The proposed buyout also is subject to a definitive agreement, receipt of a fairness opinion from Salomon Brothers Inc. and shareholder approval. </TEXT></DOC>
