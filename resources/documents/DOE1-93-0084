After adjusting for smoking habits, age, gender, and city of residence,subjects with either occupational exposure had significantly elevatedprevalence of chronic cough, chronic phlegm, persistent wheeze, and breathlessness.The adjusted relative odds of chronic respiratory symptoms for subjectsexposed to dust ranged from 1.32 to 1.60. Subjects with gas or fume exposurehad relative odds of symptoms between 1.27 and 1.43 when compared tounexposed subjects. Occupational dust exposure was associated with ahigher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) asdefined by an FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 0.6, when comparing exposedand unexposed participants (OR=1.53, 95% CI=1.17-2.08). Gas or fume exposurewas associated with a small, but not significant, increase in COPD prevalence.Significant trends were noted for wheeze and phlegm with increasing durationof dust exposure. Although 36% of exposed subjects reported exposureto both dust and fumes, there was no evidence of a multiplicative interactionbetween the effects of the individual exposures. Smoking was a significantindependent predictor of symptoms, but did not appear to modify the effectof dust or fumes on symptom reporting. These data, obtained in randomsamples of general populations, demonstrate that chronic respiratorydisease can be independently associated with occupational exposures.</TEXT></DOC>
