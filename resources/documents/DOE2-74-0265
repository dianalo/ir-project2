This energy carrier can be produced from the unlimited energysources - solar energy, wind energy and hydropower - and from nuclearenergy. It is also capable of one day supplementing or superseding thefossil energy carriers oil, coal and gas. What is special about the bookis that it goes beyond a mere physical/technical description to discussthe economic and political aspects and ecological effects and requirementsthat are an essential part of sound energy planning today. Thus, theauthors and editors outline the step-by-step development of a hydrogeneconomy, mainly based on solar energy, providing a solution to both thepollution problems caused by the use of fossil energy carriers and theenergy requirements of the third world.
