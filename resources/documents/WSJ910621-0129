For Germans, whether to restore Berlin to its traditionalrole or maintain the seat of government here in Bonn becamethe most emotional issue since unification last October.</LP><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl set the tone with his impassionedadvocacy of Berlin: &quot;I dare make this assertion -- if it hadnot been for Berlin in the past four decades, and if it hadnot been for what Berlin and Berliners meant for us, Germanunity would not have been possible,&quot; he told parliament.&quot;Berlin was the focus of Germany's division and of yearningfor German unity.&quot;   The move to Berlin could take more than a decade tocomplete and will be extremely costly. It shifts Germany'spolitical center back toward the east. Indeed, advocates ofBerlin cited both the desire of residents of former EastGermany for the move as well as the importance of aidingdeveloping democracies in other former Communist states.   Under the terms of German unification set last October,Berlin was proclaimed the capital, but Bonn remained thetemporary seat of government and parliament. Now, by a narrowmargin of 337 to 320, Germany will shift to Berlin theChancellory, the decision-making lower-house of parliamentknown as the Bundestag, the ministries, and foreignembassies. Bonn will retain only the upper house ofparliament, the Bundesrat, and thousands of bureaucrats whoaren't needed in Berlin. The Bundestag has until the end ofthe year to draft plans for the move.   The vote sparked impromptu celebrations along Berlin'sfashionable Kurfuerstendamm. In Bonn, a crowd of severalthousand that had gathered on the city's cobblestonemarketplace stood in shocked silence as Bundestag PresidentRita Suessmuth read the result.   Bonn's economy will be badly hurt, losing as many as100,000 jobs. Advocates of keeping the capital in this cityof 300,000 on the Rhine River argued that stripping it ofgovernment would be a crushing blow. &quot;The cleaning lady, thedoorman, the chauffeur, the office worker, and thebureaucrats, they all deserve our gratitude,&quot; said IngridRoitzsch during the marathon debate preceding the vote.   Bonn was never meant to be a permanent capital. AfterWorld War II, with Berlin divided between the two Germanys,the West Germans selected Bonn as a &quot;temporary capital,&quot;enshrining in the constitution the goal of reunification andreturn of the capital to Berlin. But nobody thoughtunification would come as soon as it did. At the time theBerlin Wall collapsed less than two years ago, there was some800 million marks ($446.8 million) of construction under wayin Bonn.   In the stormy debate, former Chancellor Willy Brandtsparked an uproar by comparing Bonn to Vichy, the seat ofgovernment in Nazi-occupied France. It was a comfortableplace, he said, but no match for Paris.   Proponents of Bonn also alluded to history. Labor MinisterNorbert Bluem said unification wasn't meant to recreate the&quot;German Reich&quot; and warned against putting too much power backin the hands of Berlin, which is already the nation's largestcity.   The debate ignored party lines, putting the leadingCommunist member of the Bundestag, Gregor Gysi, in the samecamp as Chancellor Kohl in their advocacy of Berlin. Mostrepresentatives of former East Germany fervently backedBerlin, which was the Communist state's capital throughoutits existence.   Berlin is also the nation's traditional capital. It wasthe seat of German power from 1871 until 1945. It has 3.4million people and is one of the cultural capitals of Europe.By comparison, Bonn was a city so sleepy that it wasdisparagingly referred to by a phrase John Le Carre made thetitle of one of his novels: &quot;A Small Town in Germany.&quot;   Berlin's dark history weighed in the decision. KarlKaiser, director of the research institute at the GermanSociety for Foreign Affairs in Bonn, says Germany's Europeanneighbors probably won't like the choice. &quot;It doesn't matterto the Americans,&quot; he says, &quot;but for other Europeans, Berlinis filled with bad memories.&quot;   It was in Berlin that Hitler hatched plans for theHolocaust and launched World War II. The remains of Hitler'sbunker are still visible a short distance from the Reichstag,which will now become the headquarters of the Bundestag.   Yet, in the end, it was Berlin's positive,post-unification symbolism that overcame these concerns andworries about the cost of the move. Berlin is considered thesymbol of German unity and a focal point for theredevelopment of eastern Germany. It is a gateway to theeast.   This week's meeting of the 35-member Conference onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, which took place inBerlin, is an example of what advocates hope will be thecity's new orientation.   The costs of the move are hard to predict. In recentmonths, Bonn boosters have suggested it could cost more than60 billion marks, while Berlin advocates say it could be donefor a fraction of that.   It's unclear whether the Germans will take over thegovernment buildings, many of them dating from the Naziperiod, that were used by the now-defunct government of EastGermany.</TEXT></DOC>
