As recently as last week, officials of the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created to sell and liquidate thrifts taken over by the government, had discussed setting the required capital infusion at 6% of assets. That prompted some worry in the thrift industry that the better-capitalized banking industry would have a stronger hand in buying up the government's inventory of sick thrifts.    &quot;This will stimulate additional interest among thrifts,&quot; said Kip Weissman, an attorney with Silver, Freedman andamp; Taff here. Mr. Weissman said there are many thrifts that can raise the 4.5% capital but would balk at trying to raise 6% because profits might not justify it.    Also, the assets on which the 4.5% level will be based will be adjusted for riskiness. Thus, broke institutions that hold less-risky loans, such as home mortgages, should be less expensive to acquire than thrifts that hold many commercial loans, which are considered riskier.    It's unclear, however, how the requirements for initial capital infusions will work with other capital standards for all thrifts that regulators are now working out. In a statement, the RTC said Danny Wall, an RTC board member who is also the top thrift regulator, voted for the 4.5% level but indicated that a higher or even a lower capital rate may be needed to operate the thrift.    In addition, the RTC said it moved the deadline for bids on five insolvent thrifts to Tuesday because of the announcement of the policy. The previous deadline had been yesterday. The thrifts are University Federal Savings Association of Houston; Freedom Sandamp;L, Tampa, Fla.; Hill Financial Savings Association in Red Hill, Pa.; People's Heritage Savings, Salina, Kan.; and Pacific Savings Bank, Costa Mesa, Calif. </TEXT></DOC>
