(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Liggett andamp; Myers president ignoredthe issue of smoking and health until the 1964 Surgeon General'sreport, and asserted that smoking posed no hazard because it neverharmed him, according to evidence released Wednesday.   Milton E. Harrington said in testimony read for the jury thatcompany officials ``didn't even discuss a position about smokingand health as far as the corporation was concerned.''   Previous testimony in the trial, in which Liggett and two othercigarette makers are being sued over a smoker's lung-cancer death,revealed that Liggett had a 25-year research program, starting in1954, to develop a less carcinogenic cigarette that was nevermarketed.   Harrington, under questioning by plaintiff's attorney Marc Z.Edell, said the 1964 report ``was a concern to us as it was toother people in the industry.''   But Harrington said, ``I didn't think anything about smoking andhealth other than smoking was not harmful to you in any way.''   Edell asked the basis for that opinion, and Harrington replied:``It didn't ever harm me.''   Edell pressed him for the facts he considered, and Harringtonsaid it was ``just my belief.''   Once the Surgeon General's report came out, Harrington said hedidn't look further into the validity of its findings because ``itwouldn't do any good anyway.''   He said he read it as executive vice president, shortly beforebecoming president.   Edell asked Harrington about the adequacy of federally mandatedwarnings on cigarette packs required in 1966.   ``We didn't care to warn the public about anything. We just hadto put that warning on. It wasn't because we liked to. It was justsomething we had to do. We weren't interested in warning the publicabout something,'' Harrington replied.   Harrington, who has since died, was 76 when the testimony wastaken by attorneys for Antonio Cipollone, 64, of Lakehurst, N.J.,who is suing Liggett Group Inc., Philip Morris Co. and LorillardInc. for the death of his wife Rose. Liggett Group is the parentcompany of Liggett andamp; Myers.   It was read in court Wednesday by Edell and an actor playing therole of Harrington. The executive was a former semi-professionalbaseball player who joined the company in 1934 and rose through theranks until becoming president and chief operating officer in 1964.He retired in 1972.   Responding to Harrington's statements, Liggett spokesman AlanHilburg said the witness was ``nearly 80 years old when he gavethat testimony.''   ``It wasn't unusual for people's memories to fade over thatperiod of time,'' Hilburg said. He said he did not know whenHarrington died.   Cipollone charges that the three tobacco companies, makers ofthe brands Mrs. Cipollone smoked, neglected to do enough researchon cigarettes, didn't reveal adequately what they did find andfailed to put safer cigarettes on the market.   One reason for not marketing the safer cigarette, Edell argues,was because to do so would weaken the companies' defense againstlawsuits over their existing products.   Referring to a 1968 memorandum from Liggett's researcher toHarrington on a meeting of tobacco company scientific directors,Edell asked what Harrington did with similar memos after readingthem.   ``I read that and probably referred it to our legaldepartment,'' the former executive replied.   ``Why?'' asked Edell.   ``Because I thought they should know about it,'' Harringtonreplied.   ``Why?'' Edell pursued   ``That was just our policy. They were the people that I washolding responsible.''   The purpose of the conference detailed in the memo was to``discuss the scientific aspects of the problems facing the tobaccoindustry with specific emphasis on tobacco and health,'' thedocument said.</TEXT></DOC>
