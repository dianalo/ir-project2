Pneumomediastinography was very useful todiscern whether the thymoma was invasive or noninvasive, but not contributoryto know whether the thymus was composed of folicular lymphoid hyperplasiaor normal thyimic tissues. Computed tomography was also useful to derterminethe localization and the invasiveness of the thymoma, but not helpfulto know whether the thymus was of follicular lymphoid hyperplasia ornormal tissues. However, the finding of ''reticular pattern''-many smallnodules scattered resicularly in the thymus-in computed tomography couldbe regarded as a sign suggesting follicular lymphoid hyperplasia of thethymus. Therfore, both pneumomediastinography and computed tomographywere very useful in the diagnosis of the localization and the invasivenessof the thymoma but not for the diagnosis of follicular lymphoid hyperplasiaof the thymus. Neverethless the finding of ''reticular pattern'' computredtomography was helpful in the diagnosis of follicular lymphoid hyperplasia.</TEXT></DOC>
