Subsidies encourage overproduction, keep farmers dependent ontheir governments for support, hurt farm exports of developingnations and cost taxpayers billions of dollars.   The drought created an opportunity to phase out the subsidies bypushing up worldwide market prices closer to the prices that theUnited States and Europeans guarantee to their farmers.   In fact, though, governments are not curtailing their subsidyprograms. One reason is that since the drought began, the rise inworld prices has made the programs more tolerable because they areless expensive to finance.   The drought, in effect, has lessened the budgetary urgency ofcurbing farm supports.   The durability of the farm programs helps explain whyagriculture is such a contentious issue in world trade.   ``Whenever weather conditions allow you to spend more for farmprograms, you will. Whenever weather conditions allow you to cutback on spending, you don't. It's a ratchet effect,'' said RobertPaarlberg, a farm trade expert who teaches at Wellesley College inWellesley, Mass.   If the weather returns to normal, farm subsidies could becomehugely expensive next year because this year's higher prices arelikely to encourage overplanting in Europe, Australia, Argentina,Brazil and possibly North America.   If bumper crops push prices down, programs that support priceswill automatically pay heavy subsidies to farmers to protect themfrom the consequences of overproduction.   In contrast, if next year is another drought year, another setof farm policies aimed at reducing stockpiles could contribute toshortages and a run-up in prices.   The U.S. government has been reducing stockpiles to remove an``overhang'' of inventories that depresses domestic farm prices.But if crops are small next year, a possible lack of adequatestockpiles could cause prices to soar.   The best evidence of the difficulty of reducing farm programs isthe persistence of export subsidies, which both the United Statesand Europe use in an expensive battle for foreign customers.   The drought has led to a reduction _ but not an elimination _ ofthe use of the subsidies, which benefit foreign consumers more thanfarmers at home.   The biggest beneficiary of the U.S. Export Enhancement Programhas been the Soviet Union. The Soviets have bought nearly 13million metric tons of subsidized American wheat since 1985, whenthe program was begun to combat subsidies by the European EconomicCommunity.   Through the program, the United States gives away foodstockpiles that were purchased with tax dollars in order to helpU.S. exporters offer food at lower prices to customers who mightotherwise buy subsidized European food.   Since 1985, the program has aided in achieving $5.4 billion inexport sales. But of that, the government contributed food boughtwith taxpayer dollars for $2.9 billion.   While the ostensible purpose of the export program is to keepU.S. exports competitive in world markets, the program is also usedto get rid of excess farm products that would depress domesticprices.   For example, the program has been used to ship more than 60,000head of dairy cattle to such places as Iraq, Indonesia, Egypt,Turkey, Morocco and Algeria. The cattle were exported becauseslaughtering them for beef would have depressed U.S. beef prices.   Because of the high cost of transporting live animals,government subsidies have ranged as high as $1,000 a head on cattlethat are sold overseas for $1,400 a head.   Seventy-three percent of all wheat exports this year have beensubsidized under the Export Enhancement Program, making wheat themain commodity covered by it. Others have included barley, rice,sorghum, eggs, frozen poultry and vegetable oil, as well as thedairy cattle.   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng vowed in June that theUnited States would continue the export program in spite of thedrought.   ``It's impossible for us to make firm forecasts,'' he said.``But I'll tell you this, that we will not neglect our exporttrade.''   Europeans deny they have been the aggressors in exportsubsidies. The European Economic Community's farm supports arebeing curtailed for budget reasons, said Derwent Renshaw,agricultural counselor for the trade bloc's office in Washington.   Farm lobbyists are unenthusiastic about export subsidies becausethey depress world prices, but end up supporting them because theypromote exports and reduce stockpiles.   The National Farmers Union, for example, supports the program asa second best because the government did not require as large of aset-aside for idling crop land as the group wanted.   Talks on reducing farm subsidies are being conducted under theauspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, theGeneva-based body that overseas international commerce.   A midterm progress review on the talks is scheduled for Montrealin December. The United States has been hoping to come up with atleast a framework for subsidy reductions by then, but the outlookfor that appears dim.   Paarlberg faults the Reagan administration for setting``hopelessly grandiose'' goals in the GATT talks.   ``We could have had an agreement on export subsidies if that hadbeen focused on,'' he said.   Progress in Montreal is still possible, but it will depend onconditions in the preceding weeks, such as the weather and theEuropean budget situation, said Leonard Condon, the deputyassistant U.S. trade representative for agricultural affairs.   ``We're talking about tough issues here and political leadersdon't like to resolve tough issues until they have nowhere else togo,'' Condon said.</TEXT><TEXT>   Editor's Note: Peter Coy has reported on trade-related issuesfor The Associated Press for three years.</TEXT></DOC>
