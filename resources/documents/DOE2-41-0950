Access is given to the structure, operation and performanceof a measuring set-up recording collector characteristics, the characteristic'stypical features, and the heat loss parameters of pipes and storage systems.After discussing the energy balance of a solar process heat plant equippedwith hot-oil storage system (cold store), heat exchanger (freezer) andhot water storage system the paper presents a number of system characteristicsof differently located solar plants (climatic zones, industrial planning).(HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
