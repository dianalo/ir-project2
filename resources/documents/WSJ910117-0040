The tough-talking labor organizer, who used afactory floor as her power base, actually helped bring theclash about. As head of a militant group here called theCivilian Committee, she played the key role of organizingdemonstrations last week that gave local hard-liners apretext for sending in the tanks. Her activities show justhow fragile democracy in the Soviet Union is, and how anordinary person can have extraordinary influence in undoingit.</LP><TEXT>   Mrs. Mkhitaryan's Civilian Committee was formed in April1990, one month after the newly elected Lithuanian Parliamentvoted to push for independence from the Soviet Union.According to people familiar with the organization, it iscontrolled by local pro-Moscow Communists.   Mrs. Mkhitaryan and a few others, seeking to reverse therepublic's drive toward independence, used several largefactories in the Lithuanian capital to recruit people totheir cause. Early on, the group was intent on a showdownwith the new government and its president, VytautasLandsbergis. The Vilnius crackdown, in fact, wasn't aspontaneous eruption but the product of weeks of advance workby leaders of Lithuania's small Communist Party, localmilitary commanders, the KGB and a number of worker'srepresentatives, such as Mrs. Mkhitaryan.   Mrs. Mkhitaryan, a stout woman in her 40s who has dyedplatinum blond hair, is Byelorussian and describes herself asa worker with only a grade-school education. She doesn't hideher disdain for Lithuania's leadership. &quot;A mini-empire, atotalitarian system&quot; was taking shape under Mr. Landsbergis,she contends. &quot;They tried to create artificial enemies out ofthe Russian workers and the army here.&quot;   Such talk, however exaggerated, strikes a chord with manynon-Lithuanian residents of the republic. They complain thatMr. Landsbergis's nationalist government discriminatesagainst them, and point with anger at a new law that requirespeople holding official positions to speak Lithuanian, alanguage that bears no relation to Russian. &quot;We don't supportthe government,&quot; declares Nina Dobrolyubozna, anassembly-line worker at the Vilna appliance plant in Vilnius,where Mrs. Mkhitaryan is based. &quot;We want justice.&quot;   Until last week, Lithuania's hard-liners could count onthe support of only a tiny part of the republic's population,which is 80% ethnic Lithuanian. But then the governmentunwittingly changed the equation.   In an attempt to overhaul the republic's economy, itsleaders announced huge price increases on most goods. Thedecision set off a broad anti-government revolt that for acrucial few days united militant non-Lithuanians with theirLithuanian worker colleagues. That was all the CivilianCommittee needed.   Mrs. Mkhitaryan and her group urged workers at the Vilnaplant and other factories to act. Algirdas Susas, an ethnicLithuanian who heads the Vilna labor union committee, saysabout 70% of the factory's mainly Russian workers opposed theprice rises; they listened to Mrs. Mkhitaryan's appeals.Soon, the Vilna union and other factories agreed to sendworkers to a huge rally outside parliament to protest theincreases.   The demonstration proved enough to convince Mr.Landsbergis and parliament to rescind the price rises. Havingtasted success, Mrs. Mkhitaryan set about mobilizing a strikeand another rally three days later, this time calling for theresignation of the Landsbergis administration and theimposition of direct rule by Moscow. Tempers were high.   On Dec. 16, some two dozen hard-line groups, includingMrs. Mkhitaryan's committee, local military commanders andthe Communist Party, set up a so-called Congress ofDemocratic Forces and appointed a committee of Communistleaders to head it. Last week, the organization named a&quot;National Salvation Committee,&quot; which promptly declared thatit was in charge of Lithuania. Then this weekend, Mrs.Mkhitaryan and her Civilian Committee set in motion themilitary crackdown.   Around midnight Saturday, several dozen workers sherecruited from the Vilna factory went to both the maingovernment building and the TV station, supposedly to hand ina petition demanding that the government disband. At bothplaces, they tried to push their way past small groups ofunarmed Lithuanians who were standing guard. They were easilyrepelled without force, but the National Salvation Committee,claiming the workers were met by fierce armed resistance,immediately asked the military to intervene.   Several hundred paratroops, backed by tanks and armoredcars, then stormed the TV studios. Protesters were crushedunder tank treads and soldiers charged into the building,firing their Kalashnikov rifles. Fifteen people were killed,scores more were wounded. Asked what authority the NationalSalvation Committee had to call in the troops, Mrs.Mkhitaryan admits, &quot;I don't know.&quot;   Valery Pankin, a 50-year old Communist Party official atthe Vilna factory, was one of the people who marched on thegovernment building that night. Without hesitation, heacknowledges the whole affair was a premeditated attempt totake over Lithuanian TV by force. &quot;The National SalvationCommittee decided to take over the mass media because theygave one-sided information,&quot; he says, ignoring Mrs.Mkhitaryan's efforts to shush him. The military crackdown wasunavoidable, Mr. Pankin contends, but adds that the operationwas &quot;stupidly done.&quot; Too many people were killed, he says.   For her part, Mrs. Mkhitaryan is dismissive. &quot;People tellme my hands are covered in blood,&quot; she says. &quot;The blood ofthose who died is on the hands of the parliament deputies whogot the people to defend their incompetence.&quot; As she speaks,soft choral music to honor the dead plays in the backgroundover the factory's loudspeakers. Mrs. Mkhitaryan isn'tdistracted. She demands that the Landsbergis governmentdisband and that direct rule be imposed by Moscow. &quot;We'realready in a state of civil war,&quot; she claims.   The Lithuanian government is taking no chances. It rapidlyfortified the parliament building with huge concrete blocksand makeshift anti-tank defenses. Officials say they expect amilitary assault on the building at any time. Meanwhile,hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians rallied in the streetsyesterday to mourn those killed in the weekend's protests.   At the Vilna factory, the labor union that, for a fewfateful days, joined forces with Mrs. Mkhitaryan, now angrilysays it was used by the hard-liners. Mr. Susas, the laborleader, believes Mrs. Mkhitaryan &quot;knew where things wereleading.&quot; He says workers feel ashamed. Whatever misgivingsthey might have had about Mr. Landsbergis, he adds, &quot;only atiny part of the work force doesn't take what happened as anational tragedy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
