The rate of the oxidation greatly depends on the differencein redox potentials between Ce/sup 3+/-Ce/sup 4+/ (E/sub Ce//sup o/)and metal ions couples (E/sub M//sup o/). The following three cases areconsidered: 1 E/sub Ce//sup o/ andgt; E/sub M//sup o/, 2 E/sub Ce//sup o/{approx_equal} E/sub M//sup o/, 3 E/sub Ce//sup o/ andless; E/sub M//sup o/.No production of Ce/sup 4+/ takes place in the presence of Fe/sup 2+/(case 1). The oxidation of Ce/sup 3+/ competes with that of Cr/sup 3+/or Mn/sup 2+/, and the current efficiency eta/sub e/ (%) decreases withincrease in the metal ion concentrations (case 2). However, after themetal ions of Fe/sup 2+/, Cr/sup 3+/, and Mn/sup 2+/ have been completelyoxidized to Fe/sup 3+/, Cr(VI), and Mn(IV), the values of eta/sub e/are independent of the presence of the metel ions. The eta/sub e/ islittle affected by Ni/sup 2+/ (case 3). A high value of eta/sub e/ ({ge}80 %) can be obtained by keeping the Ce/sup 4+/ concentration (e.g. above1 x 10/sup -3/ M) in the solution, even in the presence of above themetal ions.</TEXT></DOC>
