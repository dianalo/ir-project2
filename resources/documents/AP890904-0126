Italian and Cuban officials worked Monday to identify victims ofSunday's crash in which all but one of the 126 people on theSoviet-made jetliner were killed. Cuban news reports said another 25were believed killed on the ground.   Cuba's official news agency Prensa Latina said 22 bodies had beenidentified by Monday evening, including four crewmembers and ninewho were killed by falling wreckage after the plane exploded. It didnot release any names.   Prensa Latina said 104 bodies had been taken to the medicalexaminer's office.   The plane crashed during a heavy thunderstorm after takeoff fromJose Marti airport, sending flaming debris plummeting intoneighborhoods on the southern outskirts of the capital.   The chartered Cubana de Aviacion jetliner en route to Milan wascarrying 113 Italians, two Cubans and a crew of 11, said the Cubanambassador to Rome, Javier Ardizones. He confirmed there was onesurvivor.   The cause of the crash had not been determined, but a ForeignMinistry employee in Rome said the weather appeared to be a factor.   ``It was very bad, a storm, with rain and lightning,'' he said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   The lone survivor from the plane was not immediately identified,Prensa Latina. It did not give the survivor's condition.   Cuban film critic Jose Antonio Gonzalez, 44, was one of the twoCubans killed, it said.   President Fidel Castro and Nobel Prize-winning author GabrielGarcia Marquez visited the crash site and then Castro visited thehospitals where Prensa Latina earlier reported that at least 63people were taken with injuries. Many had extensive burns andmultiple fractures, Prensa Latina said.   The latest report did not make clear whether the number ofinjured people changed as the death toll climbed to 150 from 126 thenews agency reported earlier.   A taxi driver and three passengers he was driving down BoyerosAvenue in the Havana suburb of Boyeros were among the injured, itsaid.   Prensa Latina said the crash of the Ilyushin 62 was the worst inthe history of Cubana de Aviacion.   The fact that most of the victims were foreigners and the bodieswere burned slowed the identification process, the agency said.   ``In this task, we are receiving valuable collaboration fromofficials of the Italian Embassy and the Revolutionary NationalPolice,'' it said.   Many of the 24 people being treated at the Calixto GarciaHospital, one of several where the injured were taken, had burns onmore than 70 percent of their bodies and multiple fractures, itsaid. Fifteen were in critical condition, six serious and the resthad minor injuries, the agency said.   A government commission headed by Rogelio Acevedo, president ofthe Civil Aeronautics Institute, was investigating the cause of thecrash, Prensa Latina said.   Castro expressed his condolences to the Italian people in amessage sent through the Italian Embassy in Havana, the report said.   Planes were landing Monday at Jose Marti airport but were nottaking off from there, Prensa Latina said.   Italian television showed footage of emergency workers rushingthrough the wreckage carrying bodies on stretchers in the darkness.Firefighters aimed streams of water at the charred shell of theplane.   Nearby were the smoldering hulks of two trucks apparently hit bythe plane. Youths stood at the door of a one-story house whose roofappeared damaged by the nearby plane. Flames leaped from a pile ofrubble.   Soldiers in green uniforms surrounded the plane, helping rescueworkers sort through the wreckage.   Mexico's Excelsior news agency said there was a heavy downpourwith thunder and lightning when Flight 9046 took off for Milan,Italy, with a scheduled refueling stop in Cologne, West Germany.   Pope John Paul II sent condolences Monday to the families ofvictims.</TEXT></DOC>
