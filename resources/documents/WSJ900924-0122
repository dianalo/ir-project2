A federal judge is expected to hear arguments today fromlawyers for Mr. Milken, his brother, Lowell Milken, severalmedia organizations and others about a sentencing memorandumthat the government has filed with the court about Mr.Milken. The sentencing memorandum, filed under seal thismonth, contains information about the six securitiesfraud-related crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty inApril, as well as a host of other alleged crimes that thegovernment believes he committed.</LP><TEXT>   The government's sentencing memo, which is understood tototal more than 200 pages, is intended to persuade U.S.District Judge Kimba Wood to issue a stiff sentence when Mr.Milken appears before her next Monday. Mr. Milken's lawyershave had the opportunity to rebut the government'sallegations in their own memo.   Lawyers for Lowell Milken asked Judge Wood late Friday toorder prosecutors to delete those portions of theirsentencing memo that refer to Lowell Milken. Lowell Milkenwas employed by the Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bonddepartment that his brother headed for Drexel Burnham LambertInc. Drexel filed for bankruptcy this year.   Lowell Milken had been charged with securities and taxfraud in an indictment filed last year. But the governmentagreed to dismiss all charges against Lowell Milken when hisbrother agreed to plead guilty. His lawyers said that &quot;thegovernment has pursued a meritless case against LowellMilken,&quot; and that any mention of him in his brother'ssentencing memo would violate his Fifth Amendment rights. TheFifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution forbids thegovernment from publicly charging a person with thecommission of crimes unless he has the opportunity to defendhimself at trial.   Meanwhile, Judge Wood also will decide whether any portionof the sentencing memo can be released prior to Mr. Milken'ssentencing. Several media organizations, including thisnewspaper, have argued that the public has a right to viewthe memo before Mr. Milken is sentenced. However, Mr.Milken's attorneys oppose any release of the memo before nextweek, arguing that early release could lead to &quot;undue publicclamor and improper pressure&quot; on the court.</TEXT></DOC>
