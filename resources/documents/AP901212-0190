And she has no regrets.   Miss Burditt admits to having a good time as she confines herbent for murder to the scripts of ABC's ``Father DowlingMysteries'' and the NBC legal drama, ``Matlock.'' She is aco-producer on each series.   ``It's difficult to think of all those murders,'' she said,``but it's such fun. I have no regrets whatsoever. It's wonderfulwhen we have our story meetings and come up with interesting waysto do away with people. Can we hang someone? No, we hanged someonelast year. What kind of poison kills instantly? The only murderthat made me uneasy was on `Matlock.' The victim was in a bathtuband someone threw a hair dryer into the tub.''   Although she's an experienced writer, Miss Burditt said shefound it difficult to adapt to the mystery format.   ``I'd written two books and several movies, but until I startedon `Father Dowling' and `Matlock,' I'd never plotted a killing thathad to be solved,'' she said. ``It was a whole new way of thinking- and writing - for me. You have to come up with a murder that willinterest people.   ``You have to let the audience know what Father Dowling knowsand what Sister Steve knows. I work out the premise of the storyand the beginning. It has to be in a setting that will involve yourcharacter. Then I skip to the end.   ``The acts in between will take you through all the twists andturns to the solution. The murder mystery tends to be formulaic.You start out with Dowling. You have to connect the victim or thekiller to him. There must be some personal relationship. The clueshave to be there for everyone to see.''   At the time of the interview, she was working on a politicalassassination story for ``Father Dowling.''   ``It's a real puzzle,'' Miss Burditt said. ``It takes you in onedirection and then another. Dowling is the friend of a blackBaptist minister, and we open in his church with gospel music. Thetarget is a candidate for district attorney. If we do it right, theaudience will think the target is one candidate, while it's reallythe other.   ``We also have another murder, that of a young black musician.The minister's grandson is a suspect. The suspect's father is apolice captain, and he disapproves of him playing in a jazz club.So it's a generational story and a chase to prevent theassassination.''   Miss Burditt had worked as a program executive at ABC and hadbeen vice president for comedy development at NBC. At ABC, she hadformed a relationship with Fred Silverman, who was then presidentof ABC Entertainment and now is an executive producer of ``FatherDowling'' and ``Matlock.''   She was asked to join the writing staff of ``Matlock'' afterwriting a movie for Silverman's company. Then the Writers Guildwent on strike and she had to wait six months to start work.   ``I was working on `Matlock,' but I would see the dailies on`Father Dowling,' '' Miss Burditt said. ``I loved the relationbetween the priest and the nun. I'm Catholic and went to parochialschools for 12 years, so that gives me a good foundation to workon.''   The requirements for each show are different. ``Father Dowling''is more of a traditional mystery. Dowling and Sister Steve, playedby Tom Bosley and Tracy Nelson, solve murders as amateurdetectives. ``Matlock'' is in the tradition of ``Perry Mason.''Andy Griffith stars as a defense attorney who must prove his clientinnocent.   Although each show uses free-lance writers, they rely heavily ona staff of producers who perform double duty as writers because ofthe time pressures of getting out a weekly show.   Miss Burditt also is the author of two books, ``The CrackerFactory,'' which was made into a movie with Natalie Wood in 1979,and ``Triplets.'' She wrote the movie ``Under the Influence,''which starred Andy Griffith.   ``The Cracker Factory'' was based on Miss Burditt's recoveryfrom alcoholism.   ``It takes place in a psychiatric ward in a Clevelandhospital,'' she said. ``I was treated there for alcoholism becauseat that time, they didn't regard it as a disease. That was 23 yearsago, and that was when I had my last drink.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Dec. 28-30</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
