(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Investigators working in a light snow on awindy runway today surveyed the burned-out shell of a jetliner thatturned into the path of another, causing a collision that killedeight people.   The investigators' spokesman refused to respond to speculationthat fog disoriented the pilot of the DC-9, which collided Mondaywith a Boeing 727 racing down a runway toward takeoff at DetroitMetropolitan Airport.   At least 20 people were treated for burns, broken bones, smokeinhalation and other injuries, and seven remained in hospitalstoday. Some had leapt to the slushy runway as an explosion offlames burned the roof off their plane.   The National Transportation Safety Board set up teams to lookinto such factors as human performance, engines and survivors'recollections. Before daybreak, investigators used stadium-stylelights to inspect the wreckage in 32-degree cold, with a wind chillof 4 degrees.   ``It's not particularly a benign environment out there rightnow,'' John Lauber, a NTSB member, said at a morning briefing.   Lauber said investigators were warned to be cautious in pickingthrough the unstable wreckage under time pressure caused by theweather. Airport officials wanted the two planes, both operated byNorthwest Airlines, moved to reopen the only runway not affected bycrosswinds, Lauber said.   Officials said the jets both left their gates at 1:31 p.m. andended up 2,500 feet apart on the same runway after the collision.   The 727 was racing down a runway toward takeoff when its wingwas sheared off by the DC-9, which had turned in front of it. Fuelpoured from the planes and the DC-9 burst into flames, killingseven men and one woman, a flight attendant, among the 43 peopleaboard.   The victims apparently died from noxious fumes before theirbodies were burned beyond recognition, Dr. Bader Cassin, chiefmedical examiner for Wayne County, said today.   ``It was like a big kerosene torch,'' said passenger John Izzo,41, of Pittsburgh, who escaped uninjured by jumping off a wing.   ``The only thing going through my mind was `I'm going to die inthis damn plane and I'm only 26 years old,''' said anotherpassenger, medical student Mike Marrone of Saddle River, N.J.   The pilots survived the collision, authorities said. One wastreated at a hospital and released, and there was no word theothers were injured.   Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons said it was unclear who was atthe controls of the DC-9 - Pilot William Lovelace or First OfficerJames S. Chifferns.   Lovelace is a 24-year veteran of the airline who had been on amedical leave for kidney stones for the past five years. Chiffernsjoined Northwest seven months ago after 20 years in the Air Force.   Flight 1482 was Lovelace's 13th since returning to work. Hisprevious flights had been observed by another Northwest pilot andfive were from Detroit.   Gibbons identified the dead flight attendant as 43-year-oldHeidi Joost of the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.   Crew members on both planes and air traffic controllers wereordered to undergo drug tests, which are routine after such anaccident.   It was not immediately known what instructions the DC-9 receivedbefore straying into the path of the 727.   Gibbons said, ``We don't know if the pilot got lost in the fogor what. But that is a topic in the investigation.''   At the time of the crash, visibility was estimated by thecontrollers' union at a quarter-mile. The ground was wet from asnow and sleet storm that delayed flights at the airport, which wasclosed at the time to inbound flights.   Lauber said the DC-9's ``black box'' recorders were sent toWashington for analysis. He declined to speculate on the cause ofthe crash.   However, Tony Dresden, a spokesman for the National Air TrafficControllers, said the DC-9 pilot apparently got lost in the fog.``The DC-9 pilot discovered at the very last moment where he was,and so the ground controller told him to immediately get off thatrunway, but it was too late,'' Dresden said.   The Federal Aviation Administration had no immediate comment onDresden's statement.   Air Line Pilots Association spokesman Al Pregler blasted the FAAfor not having installed a ground-level radar system at the airportfor avoiding collisions.   ``We have been pushing them to do this for a long time, but theyhaven't,'' Pregler said. ``It's expensive, and they don't want tospend the money.''   FAA spokeswoman Barb Dettmer said a system is scheduled forinstallation next year.   Airport officials said both planes left their gates at 1:31 p.m.and headed onto fog-shrouded runways for takeoff.   The DC-9, bound for Pittsburgh, carried 39 passengers and fourcrew members. The 727 was headed for Memphis, Tenn., with 145passengers and eight crew members.   The 727 was about to go airborne when its right wing clipped theDC-9 behind the co-pilot's seat, knocking off a rear-mountedengine. Smoke billowed from the DC-9 fuselage, where passengersapparently became trapped by the fast-moving fire.   One of the injured was reported in critical condition.   The only injuries suffered on the 727 were to people hurtevacuating the plane.   Robert Karp, 60, of Jackson, Miss., said he thought at firstthat the 727 had simply blown a tire.   ``The front end of the plane had begun to lift off,'' Karp said.``I don't think the back wheels were off the ground yet. As soon asI heard the thump we came to an abrupt stop. I remember looking atthe other plane and seeing smoke rolling out.''   Romulus, 10 miles from Detroit, was the site of the second worstair crash in U.S. history, the Aug. 16, 1987, crash of a NorthwestMD-80 on takeoff. That one killed 156.</TEXT></DOC>
