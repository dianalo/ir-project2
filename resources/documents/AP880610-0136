Reagan, during his summit meeting with Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev, accepted simple explanations for complex problems,Sharansky said at a news conference Thursday.   ``They (the West) prefer to analyze the Soviet Union in terms ofblack and white,'' Sharansky said. ``Probably, Reagan fell into thesame trap.''   For example, by saying some of the problems in the Soviet Unionare the result of government bureaucracy, Sharansky said, Reaganwrongly ``accepts that the Soviet system is like the Westernsystem.''   Though acknowledging that some reforms, such as increased pressfreedom, are taking place, Sharanksy said he doubted that realprogress would be made in human rights because the concept runscounter to the Soviet system.   ``The reforms are interesting, exciting ... but they are notchanging the principles of the system,'' Sharansky said.   The Soviet way of life says that individuals cannot decide forthemselves what to say, where to go or what to believe in,Sharansky said. He described glasnost, Gorbachev's program tocreate a more open society, as ``only a new set of instructions.''   Sharansky, who is on a tour to promote his new autobiography,``Fear No Evil,'' commented during a news conference prior to hislecture at an Atlanta synagogue.   Sharansky was arrested in 1977 and charged with espionage andtreason for his efforts on behalf of Soviet Jews seeking emigrationto Israel. He was freed and joined his wife in Israel in 1986.   He said an indication of how little progress has been made inhuman rights is that many of the prisoners he wrote about in hisbook are still locked up under the same conditions as before theGorbachev era.</TEXT></DOC>
