Rep. William L. Dickinson, R-Ala., said Wednesday he approachedMontgomery, Ala., industrialist Ben Collier in 1986 with ``what Ithought was a good business opportunity'' and Collier agreed to putup $300,000.   Dickinson said he supplied the ``contacts'' for the MontgomeryInvestment Club and the two men agreed that any profits or losseswould be shared one-third by Dickinson and two-thirds by Collier.   But the business opportunity soured when the $300,000 was turnedover to Steven A. Streit of Huntsville, Ala., whose claims ofunusually high investment earnings had attracted some 300investors. Streit eventually pleaded guilty to securities fraud andwas sentenced to 10 years in prison.   Streit's assets were frozen in early 1987, and Dickinson saidthe investment club has received about 90 percent of the $300,000from a bankruptcy clerk that is serving Streit's creditors.   Dickinson said he does not think his one-third interest in theinvestment club violates a House ethics rule that prohibits membersfrom accepting gifts of more than $100 from any individual who hasa direct interest in legislation before Congress.   ``If he's got a direct interest in legislation I don't know whatit is,'' Dickinson said of Collier. ``He's never asked me to voteany way, I don't know of any legislation he's interested in andthat's as far as it goes.''   He said he saw nothing ``illegal, immoral or unethical'' in thedeal.   Collier owns 45 percent of American Apparel Co., which wasformed in 1987 after Collier and several associates purchased theassets of the bankrupt Selma Apparel Co.   The firm now has three plants in Alabama, and according to RickCippele, a part owner of the company, has received $48.6 million inuniform contracts awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency aftercompetitive bidding.   Collier also owns half interest in National Microsystems, aMontgomery company that manufactures electronics components andtest equipment for the aerospace, automobile and applianceindustries.   Mark Chesnutt, director of public affairs for NationalMicrosystems, said $3 million of the company's $9 million in totalrevenue this year came from subcontracts with two major defensecontractors, United Technologies Corp. and GTE Government Systems.   Dickinson said he has promoted National Microsystems amongdefense contractors, just as he has promoted other businesses inhis district that are interested in Pentagon work.   But he said he had nothing to do with Collier's purchase of theassets of Selma Apparel, or with the new company's subsequentapproval by the Pentagon as an acceptable bidder on defensecontracts.   Before Collier began negotiating to buy the bankrupt firm,Dickinson said he signed a letter along with other members of theAlabama delegation urging the Pentagon to save 600 Alabama jobs bypermiting Selma Apparel to resume bidding on defense contracts.   The company had been barred from bidding after its owner, JamesUtsey of Philadelphia, was convicted of federal bid-rigging charges.   After Collier submitted his bid to bankruptcy court, lawmakersagain urged the Pentagon to allow American Apparel to bid ongovernment contracts. Dickinson was the only member of the Alabamadelegation who did not sign the letter, according to WalterBraswell, an aide to Rep. Claude Harris, who initiated the letter.</TEXT></DOC>
