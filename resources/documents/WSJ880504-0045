Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   Gallstones in seven patients were rapidly dissolved without major surgery by a University of Connecticut researcher.    The gallstones were dissolved by a solvent flushed through the gallbladder at high speed by a new computer-controlled pump, the university's health center in Farmington announced.    The solvent, methyl tert-butyl ether, has been known for some time to dissolve gallstones but hasn't been widely used because it had to be pumped into the gallbladder by a hand syringe for several hours while the patient was under general anesthesia.    The new technique can dissolve gallstones in anywhere from a few minutes to six hours depending on the number and size of the stones, the university said. The seven patients who were successfully treated suffered from the most common type of gallstones which are composed primarily of cholesterol. The solvent failed to dissolve non-cholesterol gallstones in two patients, however.    The new automated system pumps the solvent through a thin catheter inserted into the gallbladder under local anesthesia, the center said. The computer monitors the flow of the solvent to prevent overfilling of the bladder. It also pulls solvent out of the bladder whenever it senses an imminent contraction of the organ. These features prevent the solvent from spilling over and damaging the intestine, a painful problem that hampered the use of the older hand-syringe method of administering the solvent.    The new system was developed by Salam F. Zakko, assistant professor of medicine. Licensing of the system to manufacturers is being handled by the University of California where Dr. Zakko developed it before moving to Connecticut, the physician said.    At present, most gallstone patients have to undergo major abdominal surgery to have the painful stones removed. </TEXT></DOC>
