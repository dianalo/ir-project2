(TRC), Texas City, Tex. TheDSS is used at the discretion of the operator, as opposed to placingtotal reliance on automation to operate the refinery. Use of the DSShas enabled TCR to eliminate production of high-end-point gasoline. Thesystem is also useful as a training device for operators, and leavesoperators in control of refining operations. Reaction time required forthe operator to make adjustments to process changes has been reducedfour-fold from strictly manual operation, and operation with DSS is lesslikely to result in catastrophic failure than that of a totally automatedsystem.</TEXT></DOC>
