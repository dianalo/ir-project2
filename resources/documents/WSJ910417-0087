Schneider S.A. of France launched a $78-a-share, or $1.96billion, tender offer for the Palatine, Ill.,electrical-products concern in February, and has twiceextended the bid. In addition, the Paris company hasnominated its own slate of directors in preparation for aproxy contest scheduled to occur at Square D's May 24 annualmeeting.</LP><TEXT>   As part of its efforts to derail the offer, Square D hasraised legal challenges to the bid. It has also disclosedthat it's in talks with unnamed third parties about apotential merger, joint venture, leveraged buyout orreorganization.   The Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterdayappears to lend additional weight to the possibility that thecompany may opt to restructure via a special one-timedividend to shareholders. That defensive technique pushes theshare price up temporarily and makes the debtladen companyless attractive as a takeover candidate.   Square D could alternatively be preparing to launch ashare-repurchase plan, another way of boosting share pricesthat also leaves the target with a heavy debt load. A thirdpossibility might be that Square D intends to itself make anacquisition.   The company hasn't yet set a final date for voting rightsat the annual meeting, which suggests to some observers thatit is seeking to place a block of shares in friendly handsprior to the proxy vote.   A spokesman declined to elaborate on the filing.</TEXT></DOC>
