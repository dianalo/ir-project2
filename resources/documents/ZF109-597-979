Samuel died July 29, 1990 at Stanford Hospitalfrom complications related to Parkinson's disease.andP;  A pioneer of artificialintelligence research, his life spanned a broad personal and scientifichistory.andM;Arthur Samuel was born in Emporia, Kansas in 1901.andP;  While attending M.I.T.,andO;from which he graduated in 1926 with a Master of Science degree in electricalengineering, he worked intermittently at General Electric Co. in Schenectady,N.Y.andP;  He later did graduate work in physics at Columbia University.andP;  Hisundergraduate school, the College of Emporia, awarded him an honorarydoctorate in 1946.andM;After receiving his master's degree Samuel remained at M.I.T.andP;  as aninstructor in electrical engineering until 1928, when he joined BellTelephone Laboratories.andP;  At Bell Labs he worked primarily on electron tubes.andO;Particularly notable was his work on space charge between parallel electrodesand his wartime work on the TR-box--a switch that disconnects the receiver ofa radar when the radar is transmitting and prevents the sensitive receiverfrom being destroyed by the high-power transmitter.andM;In 1946 Samuel became a professor of electrical engineering at the Universityof Illinois and was active in the project of designing one of the firstelectronic computers.andP;  It was there he conceived the idea of a checkerprogram that would beat the world champion and demonstrate the power ofelectronic computers.andP;  Apparently the program was not completed while he wasat the University of Illinois, perhaps because the computer wasn't finishedin time.andM;In 1949 Samuel joined IBM's Poughkeepsie Laboratory.andP;  This move was seen byIBM's competitors as a commitment by IBM to vacuum tube-based computing, butas his autobiography describes it, he had to fulfill a dual role there:pushing research on switching transistors and keeping engineers going withthe available tube technology.andP;  Tubes were used for logic and memory in IBM'sfirst stored program computer, the 701.andP;  The memory was based on Williamstubes which stored bits as charged spots on the screen of a cathode ray tube.andO;Samuel managed to increase the number of bits stored from the customary 512to 2048 and to raise the mean time-to-failure to half an hour.andP;  Memorycapacities of those machines eventually grew to 8K words.andM;He completed the first checker program on the 701, and when it was about tobe demonstrated, Thomas J. Watson Sr., the founder and President of IBM,remarked that the demonstration would raise the price of IBM stock 15 points.andO;It did.andM;The Samuel Checkers-playing Program appears to be the world's firstself-learning program, and as such, was a very early demonstration of afundamental concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI).andM;Programs for playing games fill the role in AI research that the fruit fly(Drosophila) plays in genetics.andP;  Drosophilae are convenient for geneticsbecause they breed fast and are cheap to keep, and games are convenient forAI because it is easy to compare computer performance with that of people.andM;Samuel took advantage of another fact about checkers for his learningresearch.andP;  Namely, the checker players have access to many volumes ofannotated games with the good moves distinguished from the bad ones.andO;Samuel's learning program replayed the games presented in Lee's Guide toCheckers to adjust its criteria for choosing moves so that the program would,as often as possible, choose those thought good by checker experts.andM;In 1961, when Ed Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman were putting together thefirst AI anthology, Computers and Thought, they asked Samuel to give them, asan appendix to his splendid paper on his checker player, the best game theprogram had ever played.andP;  Samuel used that request as an opportunity tochallenge the Connecticut state checker champion.andP;  The number four-rankedplayer in the nation.andP;  Samuel's program won.andP;  The champion providedannotation and commentary to the game when it was included in the volume.andM;Because his checker work was one of the earliest examples of non-numericalcomputation, Samuel greatly influenced the instruction set of early IBMcomputers.andP;  The logical instructions of these computers were put in at hisinstigation, and were quickly adopted by all computer designers because theyare useful for most non-numerical computation.andM;Samuel was a modest man, and the importance of his work was widely recognizedonly after his retirement from IBM in 1966.andP;  He did not relish the politicsthat would have been required to get his research more vigorously followedup.andP;  He was also realistic about the large difference between what had beenaccomplished in understanding intellectual mechanisms and what will berequired to reach human-level intelligence.andM;Samuel's papers on machine learning are still worth studying.andP;  With greatcreativity and working essentially alone, doing his own programming, heinvented several seminal techniques in rote learning and generalizationlearning, using such underlying techniques as mutable evaluation functions,hill climbing, and signature tables.andP;  Some of the proposals one currentlyhears for research in this area are less sophisticated than his work of the1950s.andM;Besides engineering and computer science, Samuel did important managementwork at IBM.andP;  He played a large role in establishing IBM's Europeanlaboratories and setting their research directions, especially in Vienna andZurich.andP;  The Vienna laboratory did important work in computer languagespecifications and the Zurich laboratory, in physics, leading to severalNobel prizes.andP;  He became the editor of the influential IBM Journal ofResearch and Development.andM;Samuel retired from IBM in 1966 and came to Stanford University as a lecturerand research associate, starting yet another life.andP;  In 1974 he became aresearch professor here.andP;  He continued his work on checkers until his programwas outclassed in the 1970s.andP;  He also worked on speech recognition until thefunding agency, DARPA, decided to concentrate its speech work on developing asingle approach.andP;  Arthur was actively teaching up to 1982.andP;  He supervisedseveral Ph.D.andP;  dissertations at Stanford.andM;Arthur Samuel remained an active computer programmer long after age forcedhim to give up active research.andP;  His contributions included work on the SAILoperating system, on Software for the Livermore S-1 Multiprocessor, and onthe TEX typesetting system.andP;  His last work, which he continued to the age of86, involved modifying programs for printing in multiple type fonts on someof the Stanford Computer Science Department's computers.andP;  We believe he wasthe world's oldest active computer programmer.andP;  The Stanford computer he usedtells us that he last logged into it on February 2, 1990; his home computercontinued to be used throughout the summer.andM;One of Samuel's talents was understanding inadequate documentation ofcomplicated programs and writing clear and attractive manuals.andP;  His 'FirstGrade Tex' was recently translated into Japanese.andP;  Recently he started anautobiography, which, unfortunately, takes us only to his middle 60s.andM;Arthur Samuel was a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and ElectronicEngineers, the American Physical Society, the Institute of Radio Engineers,the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and a member of theAssociation for Computing Machinery and the American Association for theAdvancement of Science.andM;On a personal level, Samuel was distinguished by his objectivity andkindness-especially in helping people learn about the many matters in whichhe was expert.andM;He is survived by a brother, two daughters, and four grandchildren.andP;  Ascholarship is being set up in his honor.andP;  The family request that donationsbe sent to Arthur L.
