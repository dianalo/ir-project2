The researchers said they found evidence that bromine compounds are building up in the atmosphere. The bromines, they suspect, are coming not only from compounds called Halons used in fire extinguishers, but from chemicals used to make plastics fire retardant and to fumigate soil and agricultural products.    Until recently, scientists had focused their concerns on another group of chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, as the cause of the depletion of the ozone that protects the Earth from sun's harmful ultraviolet rays. International pressure to curb emissions of CFCs has led producers of the chemicals, which are used in refrigeration, air-conditioning and insulation systems, to announce they would phase out production of the synthetic compounds.    The new evidence of a bromine buildup comes from scientists at the Max Planck Institute of Aeronomy in West Germany and at the Physical Reteach Laboratory in India. In a report published in the British scientific journal Nature, the two teams claimed the bromine compounds are ultimately capable of doing more damage to the ozone layer than the CFCs.    While scientists have known for nearly a decade that bromines can destroy ozone, perhaps more effectively than the chlorine in the CFCs, very little evidence of bromines' presence in the atmosphere had been presented.    &quot;The findings are very important in the sense that they tell us how much of these unnatural compounds are in the atmosphere,&quot; said Ralph Cicerone, an atmospheric scientist at the federal National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.    Two of the largest U.S. manufacturers of bromine-containing chemicals are Ethyl Corp., based in Richmond, Va., and Great Lakes Chemical Corp. of West Lafayette, Ind. Ethyl declined to comment, saying that it was studying the report. A spokesman for Great Lakes disputed the findings of the study and said, &quot;There have been several studies and articles written which lead to far different conclusions.&quot;    In balloon flights last year over southern France and central India at altitudes of 10 to 15 kilometers, the scientists found the concentration of one Halon gas was, by a measure called a volume mixing ratio, about two parts per trillion parts of air. Another Halon was found at concentrations of 1.3 parts per trillion.    While seemingly minute, these concentrations were sharply higher than those found by periodic balloon flights between 1979 and 1983, the researchers said. The new figures indicated the concentrations of two of the major man-produced bromine compounds are increasing at the rate of 5% and 12% a year respectively, they calculated.    The researchers said they were reluctant to claim the figures were very accurate, but &quot;they are very strong increases,&quot; said Reinhard Borchers of the Max Planck Institute, one of the scientists who conducted the experiments.    The bromine compound concentrations are minute when compared with the CFCs, which are present at 230 parts per trillion to 410 parts per trillion. But Mr. Cicerone cautioned against complacency. He said data on chlorine emissions has been more readily available and more thoroughly studied. &quot;With bromine, it has been like pulling teeth,&quot; he said. &quot;The industry has not been forthcoming with (production and emission) data.&quot;    What concerns scientists is that even a small amount of bromine is capable of destroying vast amounts of ozone. Bromine in the air reacts with chlorine &quot;in a synergistic&quot; way that can destroy ozone even in the absence of oxygen and sunlight, they explained. Chlorine compounds in CFCs, on the other hand, require those conditions to react with ozone.    The bromines' interaction with chlorine in CFCs already in the atmosphere can help &quot;chew up ozone even faster&quot; than the CFCs do alone, Mr. Cicerone said.    The German and Indian scientists said their measurements indicated about 2,200 tons of the major Halon was being emitted into the atmosphere annually. One of the bromine compounds, called CFC-13B1, &quot;has been rapidly adopted as a fire extinguishant in enclosed spaces such as computer rooms, and CFC-12B1 is increasingly used in portable fire extinguishers,&quot; the researchers said. &quot;Release into the atmosphere occurs through leakage, fire, inadvertent discharge at disposal, and during testing and personnel training programs,&quot; they said. </TEXT></DOC>
