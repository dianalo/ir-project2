ApcarStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WORBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> LITTLE ROCK, Ark.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In his first week on the job two years ago, Curt Bradbury sat across the table from grim-faced federal regulators who were preparing to put his bank up for sale. &quot;You need to start filling this out,&quot; a regulator said, sliding a stack of documents over to him.    Instinctively, Mr. Bradbury refused and slid them back. He knew that one of Worthen Banking Corp.'s major shareholders was ready to inject $32 million to replenish the banking company's capital and that there was no need to auction it off. He was right; the Feds backed down.    The chill of that moment still lingers for Mr. Bradbury, now chief executive of the company. He runs Worthen under the scrutiny of regulators, who have limited some of Worthen's activities and must approve his plans to shore up the company. After managing in a crisis for nearly two years, Mr. Bradbury has made some headway. But as loan problems persist, he is struggling to rebuild while keeping the regulators looking over his shoulder happy.    Worthen's troubles started with the 1985 collapse of Bevill, Bresler andamp; Shulman Asset Management Corp. The fast-dealing Wall Street firm left Arkansas's biggest banking company with seemingly worthless repurchase agreements -- and a $52 million loss. Then, Worthen had heavy loan losses, and alarmed bank regulators began watching the company closely.    Mr. Bradbury believed that by raising capital and making a few changes at Worthen Bank andamp; Trust Co., the company's flagship bank, Worthen would be back on its feet. &quot;No, no,&quot; a seasoned federal regulator advised him. &quot;This will take three to seven years.&quot;    &quot;That was 2 1/2 years ago,&quot; Mr. Bradbury says, &quot;and he was right.&quot;    Worthen's problems had been worse than realized. &quot;With great shock and horror,&quot; Mr. Bradbury says, Worthen executives studied the bank's $1.4 billion loan portfolio and found &quot;a lending practice gone haywire.&quot; There was a big loan to a country club development in Surprise, Ariz., that turned out to live up to its hometown name: it was bisected by a flood plain. There were construction loans for hotels that turned out to have too few rooms to make money. Commercial loans went to businesses that later sought bankruptcy-court protection.    During the Sun Belt's economic boom in the early 1980s, Worthen had completed a bank buying spree. Loan officers felt pressured to perform for Worthen's new controlling shareholders, led by Jackson T. Stephens, an investment banker who built a fortune here as chairman of Stephens Inc.    Even in the boom years, Worthen had lazed along in line with modest earnings. Top executives had lavish offices, high above the banking floor, where a maid served morning coffee in china cups. On the terrace is an 18-hole putting green. The company owned one of Arkansas's finest duck-hunting clubs and a private plane -- though its most distant bank was less than a three-hour drive away.    The Bevill Bresler debacle turned out to be a ground-breaking for Worthen's rebuilding, which, judging by the $7.3 million second-quarter net loss reported this week, still has some way to go.    When the rebuilding started, Mr. Bradbury, who became chief executive last January, and his predecessor went on a cost-cutting rampage. The china coffee service was replaced with Styrofoam cups, the bank dining room was closed, the company cars, the plane and the duck club were sold. Worthen executives rented out their suite of offices for $100,000 a year.    Worthen shaved its costs 12% to 15% annually, Mr. Bradbury estimates, mostly because it cut staff 13% to 1,480 workers from 1,700 two years ago. Some were fired, he says, which added a morale problem.    &quot;We've still got work to do,&quot; Mr. Bradbury says. Since 1985, Worthen has rolled up about $95 million in losses. Assets have shrunk to $1.88 billion from about $2.3 billion, and $112.8 million of its loans aren't performing, or an unhealthy 9.28% of its portfolio. Mr. Bradbury expects that Worthen will have a loss in 1987. One possible bright spot is that there may be some additional recovery of the Bevill Bresler loss this year.    Mr. Bradbury joined Worthen the week the Bevill Bresler crisis broke in 1985. He had been an investment banker at Stephens Inc. for 13 years, and had asked to go to Worthen. &quot;My wife and friends . . . think I'm attracted to a crisis,&quot; he says.    Last fall, federal and state bank regulators looked at Worthen's books and concluded that the company was in &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; condition. Regulators have classified six of its 10 bank units as &quot;problem&quot; banks; at best, they have serious financial weaknesses, and at worst are likely to fail without immediate corrective steps. But there isn't any sign that regulators are displeased with Mr. Bradbury's efforts    A big part of the rebuilding focused on tightening lendingpractices. The loan policy guide has been rewritten twice;the latest version is as thick as a big-city phone book.Among other things, it bars out-of-state loans. &quot;We can makean adequate 15% return on equity by doing basic communitybanking,&quot; Mr. Bradbury says.   He's been giving that sermon to Worthen in company slide shows as part of an effort to instill a new &quot;culture&quot; and to get people to understand that the rebuilding isn't over.    There's a new symbol of that. Each month, the bank that has the best overhead cost control wins the &quot;Styrofoam Cup Award,&quot; a white cup mounted on a trophy pedestal. </TEXT></DOC>
