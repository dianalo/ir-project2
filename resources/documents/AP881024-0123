The number of casualties was not immediately known, saidspokesman Kyaw Sann.   The fighting occurred near the village of Maethawaw, about 130miles north of Rangoon on Moei River, which forms a border betweenBurma and Thailand.   Authorities dropped leaflets over rebel-controlled areas urgingstudents who have joined the insurgents to return home under anamnesty. The students led massive anti-government demonstrations inAugust for democracy and an end to one-party rule.   The leaflets, which Kyaw Sann showed reporters, say studentswill be received at 27 special centers in the border area beforebeing sent home, and no action will be taken against them if theyhave not committed criminal offenses.   The ethnic Karen guerrillas first attacked the camps nearMethawaw on Sept. 26. The Karens, who are fighting for the autonomyof the area along the border, form the strongest of Burma's dozeninsurgencies. Karens represent about 2 million of Burma's 38million people.   Two of the five government camps surrounding the village fell tothe rebels in mid-October.   Last week, a series of clashes with rebels in the state ofKachin in northern Burma claimed the lives of 17 soldiers, wounding23 others, Kyaw Sann said.   On Oct. 18, seven rebels were killed in battles that began whenthe Kachins, one of the guerrilla groups that have fought thecentral government for decades, attacked a police outpost in MyoThit, about 500 miles north of Rangoon.   The government suffered its heaviest casualties when rebels inKachin ambushed a government convoy near Myo Thit, killing 15soldiers.   In eastern Burma, nine military personnel were killed and 24wounded when about 450 Burma Communist Party rebels ambushed atroop convoy on Oct. 19 in Mong Yang, about 500 miles northeast ofRangoon near the Chinese border, Kyaw Sann said. Two rebels werekilled, he said.   The communist rebels were driven back in late September byBurmese troops but returned to the area around Mong Yang,apparently determined to occupy the town, the spokesman said.   In another development in Rangoon, gasoline rationing forprivate cars resumed on Monday, two months after sales weresuspended because of declining supplies.   Car owners are allowed to buy between three and four gallons ofgasoline a week, depending on the size of their vehicle, thegovernment said.   Gasoline was sold in the capital for 80 cents a gallon, up from18 cents before sales were suspended on Aug. 25 after nationwidestrikes that disrupted production.   The strikes were called by tens of thousands of demonstratingstudents demanding free elections after ruler Ne Win, who came topower in a 1062 coup, resigned in July. He was replaced by Gen.Sein Lwin, who was forced to step down Aug. 13 by anti-governmentriots. On Aug. 19, Maung Maung, a Western-educated lawyer, becameBurma's first civilian president since 1962.   On Sept. 18, Gen. Saw Maung seized power and troops stoppeddemonstrations by killing hundreds of people on the streets.</TEXT></DOC>
