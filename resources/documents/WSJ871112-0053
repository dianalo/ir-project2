Hammer gave up a top job at Chase Manhattan Bank in 1985 and came to town with a vision.    The brash, energetic Mr. Hammer wanted to transform a sleepy, stodgy thrift known as Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, or PSFS, into a financial-services powerhouse with a new name.    Two years later, the new name is in place. But Meritor Financial Group has a long way to go before anybody is going to call it a powerhouse.    For the third quarter, Meritor posted a $379.6 million net loss, believed to be the second-largest ever by a thrift. The loss comes mostly from a one-time charge of $330 million to wipe away bloated good will. It doesn't, however, clean up a bushel of other problems facing Meritor.    For instance, the company has about $1 billion in nonperforming assets such as delinquent credit-card receivables and the like. Mr. Hammer is trying hard to get rid of them, but analysts say finding a buyer won't be easy. Perhaps even more difficult will be the task of keeping shareholders from straying, especially if there is a takeover attempt by a company seeking access to the lucrative mid-Atlantic banking market when Pennsylvania allows interstate banking in 1990.    Once an avid golfer, the 51-year-old chairman has little time for the greens these days. Aides say he has a tough regimen, arriving at the office no later than 7 a.m. and often working well into the night.    Many of his weekends have been filled with company retreats, where Mr. Hammer likes to knock around in a sweater and slacks, play the piano and give pep talks that subordinates compare to Knute Rockne's. Russell Palmer, the dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, uses Mr. Hammer as an example in a leadership course he teaches. Mr. Palmer characterizes the Meritor chief as an inspirer &quot;who leaves the details to other people.&quot;    In theory, that's good. But in practice at Meritor, such an approach may not be enough. &quot;He really manages to get everyone excited at these retreats,&quot; says a Meritor insider. &quot;But when we get back to the office, nothing ever gets done because he leaves all the details to other people.&quot;    Mr. Hammer must find buyers for assets that include a portfolio of old mortgages (many of which carry 7% interest rates), certificates of deposit, credit-card receivables and unattractive interest-rate swap agreements. His goal is to reduce total assets to $18 billion from $19 billion.    He will have to sell some operations that he worked hard to establish. Part of Meritor's mortgage-banking business and some of its 55 retail branches in Florida and Washington, D.C., already are on the block. Mr. Hammer hopes to raise $50 million to tide Meritor over until variable-rate investments can be made.    &quot;It's been very painful for Fred,&quot; says Jeffrey E. Stiefler, former president of PSFS, which is Meritor's core business. &quot;His goal was to grow his way out of the problem. The strategy hasn't worked very well, primarily because there's a lot of Murphy's Law at Meritor.&quot;    True to that maxim, several things that could go wrong have gone wrong. Clobbered by soaring interest rates in the early 1980s, Meritor decided to invest in interest-rate swap agreements in late 1984 as a hedge against further rises. But soon after they were bought, rates headed down sharply.    In addition, Meritor was the largest holder of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities issued by Equity Programs Investment Corp., or EPIC, which managed real estate shelters. In 1985, EPIC defaulted on more than $1 billion of those securities and filed for bankruptcy, representing the largest collapse in the history of real estate syndications. The default cut Meritor's annual profit by about $20 million for each of the past two years.    Of course, many of these problems weren't of Mr. Hammer's making. He inherited them, and he set out to solve them by expanding operations aggressively.    &quot;It didn't work out that way,&quot; he concedes. &quot;Just when you recovered from one surprise, you were hit with another.&quot;    For a brief period, it did appear that Mr. Hammer's dream for the company was on the verge of becoming reality. In the 1986 fourth quarter, for the first time in nearly two years, operations turned a profit. The achievement was repeated in the 1987 first quarter.    &quot;We thought we had made it,&quot; Mr. Hammer says. Then, rising interest rates &quot;closed the tunnel.&quot;    For Mr. Hammer, doubling up on duties now has become part of the drill. He has been forced to spend a lot of time in the finance department, rolling up his sleeves and working side-by-side with Meritor's balance-sheet experts. He plans to pare operating costs 15% and eliminate 800 jobs.    And last month, when Meritor was preparing to announce its massive third-quarter loss, Mr. Hammer spent the day with Meritor's public relations people, fine-tuning press releases for a noon news conference and an afternoon meeting with securities analysts in New York.    &quot;At Chase, we had huge human resources to do the work,&quot; Mr. Hammer says. &quot;Here, we don't have the richness of that support.&quot; Still, he adds, &quot;I generally believe that if you work hard enough, things tend to work out OK. It won't happen overnight, though.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
