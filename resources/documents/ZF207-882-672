 Unfortunately, therelatively small amount of damage done by the virus now makes theindustry look foolish, considering all of the apocalypticpronouncements that were made.andP;  This works to desensitize thepublic to the very real dangers of viruses and computer crime ingeneral.andP;  Viruses and computer terrorism could potentially have avery real and very frightening effect on the world.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer VirusesComputer CrimesSocial Issues.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Thursday the 12th: Jason gets a virusandM;&quot;From ghoulies and ghosties and long-leggety beastiesandM;And things that go bump in the night, Good Lord, deliver us!&quot;andM;-- old Cornish prayerandM;We computer trick-or-treaters have our own special kind of ghoulies --they're called viruses, and they go &quot;crash&quot; in the night.andP;  I find themabsolutely terrifying, but not for the reasons you may imagine.andM;Once again, a virus panic has swept the country; in fact, it's swept theworld.andP;  This time it involved our PC counterparts and didn't affect Macs atall.andP;  This &quot;Columbus Day Virus&quot; was coded to unleash hard disk mayhem whenthe internal clocks in infected computers passed Oct.andP;  12.andM;And, again, in what has become a recurring three-ring-circus news event, themass media seized upon this latest virus scare and inundated us withmisinformation, hysterical pronouncements and apocalyptic forecasts.andP;  As aresult, the unfortunate but limited consequences of this virus ended uplooking like a tempest in a teapot.andM;Of course, the public has a right to know about computer viruses.andP;  Some newswriters even make well-intended but futile attempts to explain the technicalnature of the problem in layman's terms.andP;  (Their reports usually end uphaving the authority of one of those &quot;I Am Joe's Liver&quot; pieces in Reader'sDigest.)andM;But as I examined the coverage of this latest virus scare, I realized it wasfocusing on what's wrong with computers, not what's wrong with the vandalswho perpetrate computer crimes.andP;  Computers are vulnerable, these storiessuggest, and therefore each and every one of us is at risk, too.andP;  Some in themass media are peddling news by appealing to fears among computer-phobicsegments of the public about &quot;those infernal machines that steal peoples'jobs and screw up our checking accounts.&quot; They end up vilifying computersrather than criminals.andM;It's scary, and so is the way this kind of virus hysteria has infected somenaive computer users.andP;  I remember how one clever fellow tried to make thatvery point by leaving a tongue-in-cheek warning on one of the nationalelectronic services.andP;  He joked about a new virus that was spreading via theelectric system, invading computer systems through their power cords.andM;&quot;It works by changing the serial port pin-outs and by reversing the directionone's disks spin,&quot; he wrote, going on to recommend against the use of powercords.andP;  Some people responded with equally playful messages; a few humorlessreaders were outraged by all this &quot;negative PR&quot; about computers.andP;  And, inclassic Orson Welles fashion, some poor souls genuinely were panicked, readyto disconnect their Macs until they purchased power-line filters that couldcombat this latest scourge.andM;If that isn't scary enough for you, consider how virus &quot;vandalism&quot; hasgraduated from random, malicious acts by sociopathic individuals to coercivedemonstrations by those with political agendas to propound.andP;  You may thinkthe &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;Dukakis&quot; viruses were misguided yet harmless enough.andO;Perhaps, but in West Germany, anti-Nazi groups claim to have viruses to seekout and destroy some neo-Nazi computer games that are illicitly making therounds in a few European countries.andP;  That's not vandalism; it'scomputer-based vigilantism -- regardless of how we may abhor thehate-mongering software it's directed against.andM;Whether these and other claims of &quot;higher&quot; social motives for viruses arereal or just smoke screens for more-common crimes, it seems like only amatter of time before the computer becomes another vehicle for terrorist acts-- software bombs instead of car bombs.andP;  The results could be devastating.andM;Misleading and exploitive reporting in the media, hysteria among computeristsand non-computerists, demented individuals, doctrinaire terrorists -- are yougetting frightened yet?andM;As for me, I take whatever sensible, practical steps I can to ward offviruses.andP;  And I don't go walking through cemeteries at night.andP;  So while I'venever lost any sleep over computer viruses or ghosts, sometimes human beingsscare the pumpkins out of me! n</TEXT></DOC>
