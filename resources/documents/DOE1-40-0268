Thus, quenching is a essential operationin plasma chemistry. This work has assessed the performance of four quenchersbased on two heat transfer concepts: cool gas injection and cooled-surfacecontact. Two of the four quenchers, designed during this investigation,incorporated the two heat transfer concepts. Based on two parameters,average quenching rate and degree of cooling, it was found that a gasinjection ring assembled to either a convergent or a constant diameternozzle gave the highest average quenching rate and highest degree ofcooling, respectively. A cooled-surface module incorporating featuresfound in both prototypes is suggested as a future program for optimizingthe quenching system performance.</TEXT></DOC>
