Wingate had a game-high 13 rebounds.;    BrentPrice scored 26 points and Bryan Sallier 24 for Oklahoma (20-15), but theirteammates combined for only 22.;    Oklahoma led 46-37 early in the secondhalf, but Stanford rallied with a 23-10 run to move ahead 60-56. Wingate had10 points and Ammann eight during the spurt, including two three-pointers.;   The Sooners pulled to within 70-67 on two free throws by Price with 1 minute,40 seconds left, but Stanford clinched the victory by making 8 of 12 freethrows down the stretch.;    The victory made Stanford the 13th school to winthe NIT and the NCAA championship. The Cardinal won the NCAA title in 1942.;   &quot;We've played so much better since the NIT started than we did in January andFebruary,&quot; said Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery. &quot;This is like a new basketballteam.&quot;;    It's no secret that the revival coincided with the return of AndrewVlahov, who missed the final 11 regular-season games after undergoingarthroscopic surgery.;    &quot;I think this tournament kind of underscored thevalue of Andrew Vlahov to our team,&quot; Montgomery said. &quot;When we were introuble, Andrew was always there to make the tough plays.&quot;;    Vlahov scored14 points and pulled down 11 rebounds against Oklahoma, taking up some of theslack as the Sooners doubled inside on Keefe. Stanford's bread-and-butter manwas held to 12 points, almost 10 below his average.;    &quot;People have beensaying this isn't much of a team, that we've got one player,&quot; said Keefe, whowas named MVP of the tournament. &quot;This proves it's not true.&quot;;    OklahomaCoach Billy Tubbs was ejected with 4:38 left in the first half. Tubbs had beenharanguing the team of Big East Conference officials but was shocked at beingejected so quickly.;    &quot;It's one of the most disappointing things I've everhad happen,&quot; Tubbs said. &quot;As coaches, you usually can tell when you're goingto get a second technical foul. I don't think I deserved either technicalfoul. I don't know what went on.&quot;;    Tubbs had questioned what he saw as amissed traveling call on Keefe. Then, when Oklahoma's Terry Evans was calledfor a foul, Tubbs used the stoppage in play to again complain about thenon-travel. Official Mickey Crowley called a technical, and before Tubbsrealized what hit him, official Pete Pavia did the same.;    &quot;I think thereferees should have to come in here and justify to you what caused thetechnical fouls,&quot; Tubbs said. &quot;I did not use profanity. I did not yell at theofficials.&quot;;  ETC.: The Cardinal's NIT championship will be celebrated todayat 1 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.;  STANFORD (78);                  fg-aft-atp; Vlahov         3-9, 8-12 14,;  Wingate        4-9 5-8 13,;  Keefe         5-10 2-2 12,;  Ammann         8-17 1-2 22,;  Patrick        2-5 7-8 13,; Lollie         1-4 2-2 4,;  Garrett        0-0 0-0 0,;  Williams       0-0 0-00.;  Totals        23-54 25-34 78.; OKLAHOMA (72);                fg-aft-atp; Holmes         1-10 1-2 3,;  Webster        1-9 2-2 4,;  Sallier       10-174-6 24,;  Harris         3-5 0-0 8,;  Price          8-12 6-6 26,;  Evans         1-11 1-3 3,;  Ware           1-3 2-2 4.;  Totals        25-67 15-18 72.;Stanford  35 43 --78; Oklahoma  39 33 --72;       Three-point goals --Stanford 7-17 (Ammann 5-10, Patrick 2-5, Vlahov 0-1, Lollie 0-1), Oklahoma7-21 (Price 4-7, Harris 2-3, Evans 1-9, Holmes 0-1, Sallier 0-1).
