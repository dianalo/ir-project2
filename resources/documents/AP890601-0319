Changing Times magazine advises you to learn the ``Medicaidshuffle'' and other maneuvers so you'll be prepared should yourparents become unable to take care of themselves.   With nursing home costs averaging $22,000 a year, about half thepatients who foot the bill see their assets wiped out, according tothe Health Insurance Association of America.   Help may be available through Medicaid, the medical assistanceprogram funded by federal and state governments. But to beeligible, an applicant must be virtually impoverished, with cashand other nonexempt assets of as little as $2,000 for an individualand $3,000 for a couple in some states. One big exception: As longas one of your parents is living at home, he or she can't be forcedto sell it to pay for the other's nursing home care. Nearly allother assets are fair game, however.   Last year's Medicare legislation introduced a new wrinkle. Inthe past a spouse couldn't be forced to pay for more than a monthof care of an institutionalized spouse applying for Medicaid.Starting this year, however, the spouse at home can be required todip into his or her assets.   Here's how it works: Medicaid totals up the nonexempt assets ofboth husband and wife and each is given credit for half. Thespouse, the wife, say, who stays at home can keep assets from herhalf worth up to $60,000. Anything over that is earmarked byMedicaid to pay for her husband's care. If the half comes to lessthan $12,000, she gets enough of the total assets to reach the$12,000 minimum, if possible. The law also sets a ceiling, usually$1,500, and a floor, currently about $800, on her monthly income.   How can your parents protect their property? Their options arelimited, says Changing Times magazine. Setting up a trust won'twork since transferred assets will be figured into the ability topay for a parent's care if the trustee has discretion to use thetrust's income or principal for the parent's benefit. Such a trustis called a Medicaid qualifying trust.   Your parents might be tempted to try an end run around the rulesby giving their assets to you or selling them to you at a bargainprice. But that tactic won't elude Uncle Sam, either. Under the newMedicaid rules, a parent can be ineligible for benefits for up to30 months following a transfer of property for less than fairmarket value to anyone other than a spouse.   Of course, your parents can outflank the government bytransferring their property more than 30 months before one of themwill be applying for Medicaid. However, that assumes they canestimate when they might need assistance, or have pockets deepenough to get through the waiting period.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
