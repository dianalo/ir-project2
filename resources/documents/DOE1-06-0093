<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-06-0093 </DOCNO><TEXT>Charge and field distributions in electron pulse irradiated polyethylenesamples were investigated using a laser-induced pressure-pulse method.A model of the accumulation and storage for pulse irradiation is developed.Good correspondence of the experimental distributions after one electronpulse with the simulations was reached for the effective mobility {mu}/subeff/ {similar_to}10/sup -2/ cm/sup 2/V/sup -1/s/sup -1/. Deviations ofthe experimental and calculated dose dependences are explained by heatingeffects during irradiation not included in the model.</TEXT></DOC>
