But with nearly 12,000 new arrivals last year, Thailand hascracked down on the refugees. Marine police and navy boatsintercept and turn away the ``boat people,'' over protests by theUnited States, the United Nations and Western aid agencies.   Western officials are concerned at what they see as an erosionof the principle of ``first asylum,'' or temporary haven forrefugees from Indochina.   Authorities have quietly turned away some boat people for years.But in January, Bangkok declared for the first time that its policyincludes expulsions, and mounted a blockade of waters borderingCambodia. Most of the Vietnamese pay for passage on smugglers'boats from Cambodia.   The Thais say the Vietnamese are not fleeing politicalpersecution, but are seeking better economic conditions. They saidthe migrants add to the country's already sizable burden of illegalaliens and threaten national security.   ``Most are not refugees. The war ended 13 years ago,'' saidSomporn Klinpongsa, the deputy permanent secretary of the InteriorMinistry. He referred to the 1975 communist victory over theU.S.-backed South Vietnam government.   ``Before they came in on small boats. Now we try to stop them,''Somporn said as he pointed to waters off this district in Tratprovince where many Vietnamese attempt to land. He was guidingforeign diplomats on a recent marine police boat tour of the coast.   Somporn claimed 30,000 ``economic migrants'' were waiting atCambodia's major seaport, Kompongsom, to take boats into Thailand.   U.S. Ambassador to Thailand William A. Brown told acongressional hearing in Washington last week that a Thai fishingvessel reportedly rammed a boat carrying Vietnamese, resulting indrownings.   Western aid officials said a number of Vietnamese drowned whensmugglers trying to evade the blockade forced them to swim toislands off Trat. At least two people died of illness as more than500 Vietnamese on the islands for a while had no regular source offood, water and medical care. There is concern that others may bestranded, unknown to authorities.   Nearly a million Indochinese have fled to Thailand since thecommunist takeovers in 1975, and in recent years the Thais havebitterly complained that the West has reneged on pledges toresettle them.   According to the office of the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees, about 117,000 Vietnamese, Laotians and Cambodiansremained in Thai refugee camps at the end of May 1987.   As of January, there were 16,040 Vietnamese in camps in Thailand.   Western nations, meanwhile, resettled 5,275 Vietnamese in 1987.The numbers dropped from a high of 26,574 in 1981 to a low of 3,391in 1982, the office said.   The overall number of Indochinese resettled in 1986 was 26,804,about 4,400 fewer than in 1985.   The Thai government toughened policies on Laotian and Cambodianmigrants last year.   It clamped down on the Vietnamese after almost 12,000 arrived in1987, triple the number the previous year, and reports surfacedthat local officials in Trat were involved in the smuggling. Thegovernor and provincial police superintendant were among those whohave since been transferred.   Most Vietnamese refugees travel overland to Cambodia. There,with the help of a network of smugglers, they board charteredfishing boats that try to slip into Trat at night. The route ismuch shorter and safer than the traditional passage across the Gulfof Thailand to the southern coast.   Electronics, vehicle spare parts and strategic contrabandregularly are smuggled to Cambodia and Vietnam aboard the boats.   Somporn said boats that are intercepted are given fuel, food andmedicine and told to turn back out to sea.   At first, authorities also towed back out to sea hundreds ofVietnamese who had already made it to shore. Somporn said suchpeople now can stay, but will no longer be sent to Phanat Nikhom, acamp near Bangkok where Western countries interview Indochinese forresettlement.   Instead, they go to camps near the Cambodian border wherechances of resettlement are slight and they risk danger from thewar between Cambodian guerrillas and Vietnamese troops occupyingthe country.   Although Somporn claims most of the refugees fled for economicreasons, 66 percent of the Vietnamese who arrived in Thailand lastyear told international aid workers they were persecuted becausethey were ethnic Chinese or had spent time in political``re-education'' camps.   Less than 2 percent cited economic reasons for leaving theirhomeland. Many Vietnamese detained at the Khlong Yai police stationsaid they fled to rejoin relatives in the United States.   Reporters were able to interview them briefly only during thediplomats' visit. Authorities have limited access to the Vietnameseby journalists and aid workers.</TEXT></DOC>
