The broadcast, monitored in Cyprus, quoted a Foreign Ministrystatement as saying that ``not even one barrel of oil'' had beensold to Israel, one of revolutionary Iran's main regional foes.   ``According to irrevocable, declared principles of the IslamicRepublic, the Oil Ministry has imposed a ban on the sale of oil andoil-related products to Israel and the racist South Africanregime,'' the statement said.   Tehran has vowed never to establish relations with Israel andSouth Africa.   The statement added that no oil has been sold to those countriessince Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, which toppled Shah MohammedReza Pahlavi.   The U.S. State Department on Tuesday confirmed an NBC-TV reportMonday that Israel bought 2 million barrels of oil worth $36million from Iran in November to help free the three Israelis heldin Lebanon.   Israeli representatives also have discussed the possibility ofselling Iran spare parts for its U.S.-made military hardware, NBCsaid, citing unidentified sources in U.S. and Israeli intelligence.   In addition to winning Iran's help in releasing the Israelis,the oil purchases and the potential spare parts deal were intendedto bolster Iran's position against Iraq, their common enemy, NBCsaid.   Spokesmen for Israel's Energy, Foreign and Defense ministriesrefused to comment on the report.   NBC reported that the U.S. government had backed the oil deal inhopes that it could help the release of eight American hostages inLebanon.   They are among 18 Westerners held in Lebanon by extremistgroups. Most are captives of Iranian-backed Shiite factions.   Iran's leaders are avowedly anti-Israeli, but the Iranianeconomy, battered by 10 years of poor management and 8 years of waragainst Iraq, badly needs foreign exchange for post-warreconstruction.   President Hashemi Rafsanjani was closely involved in clandestinearms-for-hostages dealings with the United States and Israel in1985-86.   Three American hostages held in Lebanon were freed in exchangefor deliveries of U.S.-made anti-aircraft and anti-tank missileparts.   Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-calle pragmatists, is seekingto rebuild Iran's links with the West to end 10 years of isolationand seek badly needed investment.   He generally is considered to be in favor of freeing thehostages held in Lebanon, but has limited room to maneuver becauseof opposition by hard-liners led by former Interior Minister AliAkbar Mohtashemi, who has close ties with the Lebanese militants.</TEXT></DOC>
