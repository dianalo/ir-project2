Its survey on ``The Best Companies for Working Mothers,''published in the October issue on sale today, includes corporategiants such as International Business Machines Corp., DuPont andMerck andamp; Co. Inc., as well as smaller concerns such as regional banksand hospitals.   ``The pity is there aren't more companies. It's too bad it's notthe 600 best companies,'' Judsen Culbreth, editor of the magazine,said Tuesday. ``But we do want to credit these companies as beingforward-thinking.''   The working mother is the fastest-growing category of the laborforce. More than half of all women with children younger than 6years old work outside the home, vs. 12 percent in 1950, the LaborDepartment says.   By the year 2000, the department estimates 84 percent of allwomen of childbearing age will be working. Nonetheless, less than 1percent of all U.S. companies provide child care aid to theiremployees.   Culbreth said the 60 companies on the list recognize ``there's alabor shortage and they see family benefit packages as a realrecruiting tool.''   Working Mother deputy editor Susan Seliger said the list wasbased on questionnaires mailed to hundreds of American businesses,as well as follow-up interviews with managers and employees. Shesaid the company did not attempt to rank the finalists from best toworst due to the difficulty of doing so.   ``It's not like the Fortune 500, which is cut and dried,'' shesaid. ``This is something subtler, more difficult to quantify.''   The magazine said the finalists were chosen based on salary,advancement opportunity, support for child care, and a benefitspackage that included maternity leave, parental leave, adoption aid,flexible schedules, part-time work, job sharing and support for careof elderly dependents.   It said the top 10 companies were selected based on theirsuperior showing in these categories.   Among the top 10, for example, is Apple Computer Inc., whichprovides one of the most competitive pay and benefit packages of anyU.S. company. It offers a child care center at its Cupertino,Calif., headquarters that is open until 7 p.m. Apple also bestows$500 on all new babies of its employees and provides up to $3,000 inadoption aid.   At Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, where 20 percent of managers arewomen, mothers get three years of unpaid leave with benefits andemployees have a two-hour window within which to arrive and leavework.   Merck, the world's largest producer of prescription drugs, isbreaking ground for a new child-care center at its Rahway, N.J.,headquarters, provides part-time hours for new mothers returning towork and allows employees to work at home.   Other entries include Cary, N.C.-based SAS Institute, a computersoftware maker where nearly half the managers are women and thecompany provies a free on-site child care center; and Beth IsraelHospital in Boston, where nurses can earn up to $63,000 a year, andnursing mothers can use breast-pump stations so they don't have toabandon breast feeding when they return to work.   Other members of the top 10 included DuPont of Wilmington, Del;Fel-Pro Inc. of Skokie, Ill.; Hoffman-La Roche Inc. of Nutley, N.J;Morrison andamp; Foerster of San Francisco; and Syntex Corp. of Palo Alto,Calif.   Working Mother, a 10-year-old magazine headquartered in New York,has a circulation of 460,000. Formerly part of the WorkingWoman-McCalls Group, it is now published by Lang Communications Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
