REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Communist rebels in stolen passengerjeeps raided a police station today in southeastern Luzon in anattack that left four people dead and two wounded, the militaryreported.   The raid took place about 7 a.m. in the coastal town of PrietoDiaz, 250 miles southeast of Manila. A military report said threeguerrillas and a civilian were killed and two of the seven policedefenders were wounded.   President Corazon Aquino said, meanwhile, that she wasconsidering a new amnesty for Communist rebels. In a radio interviewSunday, she said a government panel would meet soon to discussextending the amnesty, which expired Feb. 29.   In a related development, Mrs. Aquino's foreign secretary chargedthat unspecified European groups were providing financial supportfor the Communist Party of the Philippines.   About 100 guerrillas of the party's armed wing, the New PeoplesArmy, took part in today's attack, which began shortly before ashift change at the police station, a military report said.   Defenders fled into foxholes outside the station house and openedfire on the attackers. They were able to radio for reinforcementsbefore fleeing the building.   The rebels fled about an hour later with six firearms and thestation radio, the military said.   The raid took place a day after rebels killed at least 13government troops in Negros island in one of the bloodiest ambushesthis year. Eight government militiamen were also missing after theclash, the military said.   There was no report of rebel losses.   Elsewhere, the military said it had suspended combat operationson southern Luzon island while negotiations are under way for therelease of four young officers kidnapped last Wednesday by therebels in Quezon province.   Col. Ferdinand Lagman said a local congressman, Rep. OscarSantos, had made contact with the rebels to bargain for theofficers' freedom.   They were abducted at gunpoint at a rebel checkpoint by aguerrilla unit believed responsible for raiding a poultry farm lastweek.   In Manila, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus charged thatunidentified European governments were indirectly financingcommunist rebels.   He made the accusation on the third day of a conference ofrepresentatives from 13 Asian, European and Latin American countriesthat have won their freedom from dictators.   The Philippine military claims the communist-dominated NationalDemocratic Front, a rebel umbrella organization, received $15million in aid last year from groups in Europe, the United States,Japan, Australia and New Zealand.   Manglapus said foreign aid to the rebels came fromnon-governmental organizations but noted that such groups in Europeare often subsidized by governments.   He said he has filed formal protests with the Europeangovernments concerned, but did not identify them.</TEXT></DOC>
