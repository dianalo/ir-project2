More direct congressional involvementin international air quality issues occurred beginning in the 1970s simultaneouslywith an increased response to domestic air quality issues, in the formof requirements for international cooperation to solve specific problems.However, a perception of global air quality problems as being secondaryto domestic issues has precluded more coordinated legislative actionthat would effectively link congress' domestic and international effortsconcerning environmental issues. This paper identifies and discussessome of the major tools available to Congress to address internationalair quality issues in the context of broader international environmentalpolicy-making. It proposes the establishment of a mechanism for unifiedregulatory accounting, policy analysis and public information to supportintegrated air quality policies.</TEXT></DOC>
