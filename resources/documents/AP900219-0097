Dorota Simonides, a professor specializing in the folklore ofthe Silesia region, received 258,138 votes, or 67 percent, todefeat Henryk Krol, a leader of the ethnic German community in theprovince of Opole, said a dispatch by the state PAP news agency.   Krol received 124,498 votes, or 32 percent, PAP reported.   Turnout in Sunday's voting was 55 percent, compared with 31.4percent attendance during the first round on Feb. 4.   In the two weeks since Krol finished first and Mrs. Simonidessecond in a four-candidate field, forcing Sunday's runoff, emotionshave run high in the industrialized Silesia region historicallycontested by Poland and Germany.   Ethnic Germans comprise about one-third of the province's 1million residents.   Mrs. Simonides rejected any campaign appeals based on the ethnicdifference between her and Krol, but it appeared that she inheritedthe support of the two eliminated candidates, who had made suchappeals.   ``I will be a senator of all residents of the Opole province,and thus also of the German minority,'' she told Polish televisionafter her victory.   ``I would like to help to integrate, spread agreement and realreconciliation,'' she said.   The campaign was also waged against the backdrop of the plannedreunification of Germany, a prospect that raises bitter memories ofpast German aggressions.   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, seeking an ironcladguarantee of Poland's current border with Germany, has asked toparticipate at planned unification negotiations.   Opole province is part of the nearly one-third of modern Polandcomposed of lands forfeited by Germany after World War II,compensating for an even larger Polish territory taken by theSoviets on the eastern border.   Polish concern was evident during the campaign. Thepro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza reported that one campaign leafletcalled for being ``alert at the moment that the historic Germanenemy is raising his head.''   Across Opole, graffiti proclaimed, ``Krol to Germany, Germans toGermany,'' and ``Krol _ fascist,'' the newspaper said.   Opole province, 190 miles southwest of Warsaw, has the highestconcentration of enthic Germans in the country, and Krol and hisfather, Jan Krol, were founders of the area's German MinorityCultural-Social Society.   There are believed to be up to 1 million ethnic Germans amongPoland's population of 38 million.   Communist officials for decades denied that any German minorityremained in Poland. That changed with recent efforts by theSolidarity-led Mazowiecki government to assure rights to ethnicminorities, along with a visit to the region in November by WestGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   There are no ethnic Germans among the 460 members of the Sejm,the lower house of Parliament, or the 100 freely elected members ofthe Senate.   Sunday's election was to fill the Senate seat left vacant by therecent death of the incumbent.</TEXT></DOC>
