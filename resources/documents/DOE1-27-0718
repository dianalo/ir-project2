The time resolved diffraction patterns clearlyshow that this alloy crystallizes into FeSi alloy and Fe/sub 2/B in thatorder. The time evolution of these crystalline phases can be analyzedby the Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation with the exponent of about2.5 over a wide temperature range. This suggests that the crystallizationoccurs by the diffusion-controlled growth with a constant nucleationrate. The scaling behavior in the crystallization kinetics is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
