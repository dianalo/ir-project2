Securities firms slashed 1990 bonus pools to investmentbankers by an average 40% from 1989 levels, according tosecurities executives and headhunters, reflecting the deepslump in securities-industry profit, particularlyinvestment-banking revenue.</LP><TEXT>   But some executive-search executives say the worst of thepay cuts for investment bankers is over.   &quot;We have absolutely hit rock bottom,&quot; says Gary Goldstein,president of Whitney Group. As the securities businessrebounds, he argues, firms will &quot;start to again build upcompensation levels -- although certainly not to 1986 peaks.&quot;   Unlike much of corporate America, investment bankersdepend on bonuses for the bulk of their annual pay. Cuttingbonuses can save a bundle for securities firms; salaries andbonuses typically represent as much as half their operatingcosts.   But while bonuses have always varied somewhat amongindividuals, there was a far greater disparity between thehaves and have-nots in 1990, securities specialists say.   Even at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., where 1990 bonuses forinvestment bankers were flat to slightly above year-earlierlevels, there was greater differentiation among bankers whojoined the firm in the same years. Also, younger investmentbankers who joined in recent years generally had increases,although not as big as before, while the bonuses of manymore-seasoned bankers were flat or down, people familiar withthe firm said.   Don't look for the pay cuts to elicit many tears outsideWall Street. Senior investment bankers and executives who hada salary of, say, $100,000 and a bonus of $900,000 a year,now have to make due with about $640,000.   Nearly every other major securities firm felt the pinch.The cash bonuses for investment bankers at First Boston, aunit of CS First Boston Inc., were halved from 1989 levels.However, including the bonuses paid in stock, which employeescan collect over three years, the reductions aren't as steep.   Bonuses at PaineWebber Group Inc. were down about 40% forinvestment bankers and are expected to be about the same atPrudential-Bache, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. ofAmerica, which hasn't yet doled out 1990 bonuses. At MerrillLynch andamp; Co., banker bonuses fell an average of about 35%.Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., an American Express Co. unit,saw its bonus pool shrink about 30%; at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.,about 25%, and Salomon Brothers Inc., about 20%.   At every firm, &quot;the class breakdown broke down, as the{bonus} spread between the top people and the lower quartilewas massive,&quot; says Joan Zimmerman, executive vice presidentat GZ Stephens Inc., a New York executive search firm.   The wide swings in salary among investment bankers is longoverdue, some securities specialists argue. In past years,all investment bankers &quot;got sucked along in the vaccuum andwere paid amounts that were unsustainable except inhigh-earnings environments,&quot; says Abram Claude Jr., amanaging director at Russell Reynolds Associates Inc.   &quot;Now there's a big difference between what's paid torainmakers and non-rainmakers,&quot; says Mr. Claude. &quot;And it'sjustified.&quot;   ---                     Wall Street Paychecks                                                                                                          Representative pay levels for investment bankers with twoyears experience at selected securities firms; bonuses, whichare down as much as 40% from 1989, make up about half totalcompensation.
