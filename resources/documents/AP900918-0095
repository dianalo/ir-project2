ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Americans are growing increasinglydisenchanted with the two major political parties, associatingRepublicans with wealth and greed and Democrats with incompetenceaccording to a survey released Tuesday.   ``Since 1987, there has been a significant upswing in feelingsof mistrust of political leaders, disillusionment with politics andfeelings of powerlessness,'' said the Times Mirror surveytitled``The People, the Press andamp; Politics 1990.''   The study said the growing cynicism and economic polarizationamong all but the wealthiest Americans ``threatens to subverttraditional partisan politics or block the effective resolution ofsocial and economic issues.''   Another finding was that while ``anti-communism is fading as afactor in American politics, anti-Japanese sentiment has soared aseconomic expectations plummet.'' Equally dramatic was the declinein support for Israel.   ``Dislike for the Japanese has become more mainstream,''concluded the survey. ``It is no longer primarily concentratedamong the kinds of people who have been hit especially hard byJapanese competition.''   ``Growing dislike for Israel is evident across all demographic,political and social groups, except among American Jews,'' thesurvey said. But it also said that ``It is important to note thatthe sharp decline in identification with Israel has not beenaccompanied by a substantial identification with the causes of thePalestinians.''   President Bush fared as well in this as in other recent surveys,with 76 percent giving him very or mostly favorable ratings.   The findings were based on face-to-face interviews in May with3,004 adults. A random sample of 1,000 was reinterviewed betweenAug. 19 and 25. The responses for the overall sample had a marginof error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.   The responses were analyzed by Princeton Research Associates andcompared to the findings of a similar study conducted in 1987.   In the three years between the two studies, there was littlechange in Americans' affiliation with the major parties - thenumber of people identifying themselves as Republicans increased 3percentage points, while those calling themselves Democratsdeclined 4 points.   The survey found 33 percent of the respondents called themselvesDemocrats, 28 percent Republicans and 39 percent independents.   ``Beneath this surface stability however, there are volatileforces at work,'' said the study. It concluded that ``both partieshave declined precipitously in the public's estimation.''   Even among people who are the strongest supporters of theDemocratic Party, the party was viewed as ``incapable of governingAmerica successfully and unclear on what it should stand for.''   Despite the Republican success at holding the White House, thesurvey concluded the party ``has been unable to capitalize on thesedeclining Democratic fortunes because the GOP itself is now seen bya majority of the public as the political instrument of thenation's rich and powerful.''   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown said, ``I'm not at alldisheartened by those findings.'' He noted that the survey wasconducted at a time when the Republican president has very highapproval ratings, but that nonetheless it ``reinforces the pointthat we've been trying to get across, namely, that the RepublicanParty is the party of the privileged few.''   Brown said his party must do a better job of getting across thepoint that Republicans ``have been in charge of government for thelast decade. It hasn't been Democrats, and Republicans have failedtotally in managing this government.''   The latest survey found growth in the already large numbers ofAmericans feeling alienated from their government.   Among the findings were these:   -- Thirty percent said they agreed completely with the statementthat ``generally speakng, elected officials in Washington oftenlose touch with the people pretty quickly.'' Three years ago, 22percent agreed completely.   -- The majority that felt people like themselves have no say inwhat government does grew from 52 percent in 1987 to 57 percent in1990.   -- The number of people who said that elected officials carewhat they think declined from 47 percent to 44 percent.   -- Thirty-eight percent said they agreed completely with thestatement ``It's really true, the rich get richer and the poor getpoorer.'' That was an increase from 31 percent in 1987.   Drugs far outstripped other matters when people were asked tolist the most important problems facing the nation.   Thirty-six percent cited drugs, compared to 11 percent threeyears ago. The federal deficit was named by 11 percent, the sameproportion as in 1987. Homelessness and the environment each werelisted by 8 percent. Fewer than 1 percent named either matter threeyears ago.   The proportion of people willing to spend more money to combatdrugs increased from 66 percent in 1987 to 73 percent this year.   In both surveys, 67 percent said they would be willing to spendmore for the homeless and 35 percent would approve more funds toaid blacks and other minorities.   On abortion, the survey found 55 percent saying they opposedrestrictions on access to abortions. However, among Republicans andthose who lean to the GOP, 47 percent opposed restrictions and 48percent favored them. Democrats and those inclined to support theparty opposed restrictions by a margin of 62 percent to 33 percent.   When asked about attitudes toward Japan, 56 percent gave afavorable opinion and 39 percent unfavorable. Three years ago, 69percent viewed Japan favorably and 27 percent unfavorably.   The greatest increases in unfavorable opinion toward theJapanese occurred among whites, men, upper income earners and thosein the Western United States, the survey found.   On Israel, 44 percent rated the country favorably and 45 percentunfavorably. Three years ago, the split was 65 percent favorableand 27 percent unfavorable.</TEXT></DOC>
