Wall Street counts on investors making decisions on the basis of careful analysis of risks and rewards. But when the selling frenzy gripped the stock market, psychiatrists and other specialists on human behavior received more support for an alternative view. They say investment decision-making gets a lot more basic.    &quot;The myth that investments are made rationally is promulgated by brokers,&quot; says Josef Weissberg, a New York psychiatrist who has lectured on the role of money in psychoanalytic treatment. Instead, he says, the rationale for people's financial decisions verges on the &quot;weird and bizarre -- everybody's neurotic about money.&quot;    &quot;People's money attitudes and feelings have been conditioned by parents and often aren't reasonable for who they are today,&quot; says Kathleen Gurney, a psychologist and president of Financial Psychology Corp., a Los Angeles consulting firm that conducted research into the financial risk-tolerance of 4,200 investors.    Childhood attitudes, ranging from an inordinate fear of poverty to a view of money as a symbol of parental love, carry into adulthood. The result, all too often, is that people's investment patterns can be &quot;sabotaging their own contentment,&quot; she says.    Researchers, psychologists and psychiatrists say that much of what is known about financial risk and its influence on investors is based on supposedly commonsense assumptions that a growing body of research is calling into question.    Such old wives' tales as investors get more cautious with age, or that the rich are more willing than the rest of us to gamble on the market, are just that, experts say. And the belief that men are more apt than women to take risks just isn't supported empirically.    The truth or falsity of these assumptions is more than just a matter of academic inquiry. The financial services industry is intensely studying why people take risks with their money. &quot;More people are taking brokerage firms and financial planners to court, claiming that financial professionals put them in investments above and beyond the risk level they feel comfortable with,&quot; says Ms. Gurney. The liability issue, along with the prospect of learning more about how to influence investment decisions, make understanding investors' motives critical for finance professionals.    IDS/American Express Inc., which has a network of 6,000 financial planners nationwide, has been considering adopting a questionnaire that would attempt to determine clients' tolerance for taking risks. Victoria Rupp, IDS director of marketing development, says that in the past, the firm has encountered resistance from investors who don't feel comfortable with planners or who don't follow through on planners' recommendations. A risk test, if truly indicative of investor character and behavior, would serve the client better and foster the feeling &quot;that he or she is understood,&quot; she says.    Alas, &quot;almost everybody would like to see themselves as a risk-taker,&quot; says Kenneth MacCrimmon, a professor at the University of British Columbia and co-author of a study on the risk-taking behavior of 509 male executives in the U.S. and Canada. Perception and reality differ, though: When Prof. MacCrimmon compared the executives' self-assessment of their willingness to take risks with the risks these men had actually taken in life, &quot;There was a pretty big difference.&quot;    Jay Rohrlich, a psychiatrist whose practice is based in the Wall Street area, sees people who &quot;find talking about their sex life far easier than talking about money.&quot; Talking about money, however, can be just as revealing. Some of Dr. Rohrlich's more successful and wealthy patients fret that &quot;no one will like me any more if I don't have any money.&quot;    Perhaps the largest body of research into risk-taking, financial and otherwise, has been compiled by Frank Farley, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, who has been researching the topic since 1965. He suggests that the most aggressive risk-takers have what he calls a &quot;Type T,&quot; or thrill-seeking, personality that needs a greater degree of stimulation and arousal to be happy.    Dr. Weissberg says some securities traders who are his patients leave their jobs at the end of the day and &quot;break out the dice.&quot; Their &quot;need for action seems to dominate them,&quot; and the financial choices they make &quot;have more to do with that need than the specific risks they are taking.&quot;    Prof. Farley's research punctures other stereotypes: Gender differences in willingness to take risks do exist, but not in ways commonly assumed. For example, while many studies show that older, married women say they are less likely to take financial risks than their spouses, Prof. Farley finds that when men and women of the same age and income group are compared, there's no difference in their desire to take a flier with money.    The professor says he has also found that financial risk-takers tend to believe in God more than the meek investor does. Even when the religiously inclined make an investment mistake, he says, &quot;They bounce back. They have a sense they've got God on their side.&quot;    Other recent research calls into question the widely held belief that older investors are more risk-averse than younger ones. A survey of 2,000 women conducted by the Investment Company Institute found younger women were more conservative than their senior counterparts in their choice of mutual funds. And Ms. Gurney notes a phenomenon that occurs when middle-aged couples who have finished paying college bills start putting discretionary income into stocks: They love aggressive market plays, she says.    Another stereotype is that wealthy investors are more willing to take financial risks. It is true that the rich are different. For one thing, they have more money to throw around. Asking them &quot;how much is enough is like asking Picasso how many paintings are enough,&quot; says Dr. Rohrlich.    Children in school get a sense of their accomplishments from grades, says Dr. Weissberg. But for adults, &quot;grades are given by numbers.&quot; That's why we have &quot;the phenomenon of people driving on to earn more money than they'll ever need.&quot;    But even the wealthy have a limit. One-fifth of the executives polled by Prof. MacCrimmon said no rate of return whatsoever would prompt them to risk half their net worth. Even when offered a 90% chance of parlaying $250,000 into $20 million, 20% simply would not take the chance.    Most high-income people fall into one of three categories, says Ms. Gurney. One is the entrepreneur, the kind of person who manages a business better than a checking account. Another is the achiever, the hard worker who has gained wealth and wants to hang on to it. And the third are what she calls &quot;money masters,&quot; folks who approach investing in a deliberate, rational sort of way.    Only the entrepreneurs, she has found, tend to be risk-takers.    When it comes down to it, the logic of investment decisions -- what there may be of it -- often is apparent only to the investor. Richard Ross, executive director of the Center for the Study of Investor Behavior, a market research firm in Chicago, says that &quot;to somebody who has a very low threshold of risk, it's very logical to them that they expect a passbook return rate&quot; on their savings. Avoiding the potential pain of a loss of principal is worth it to them, he explains. But &quot;somebody else would look at that and say they're crazy.&quot;    ---   Ms. Peers is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---                    How Risky Are You?
