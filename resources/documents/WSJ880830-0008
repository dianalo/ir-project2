Dennis to Devote Time to Liberal Politics; '88 Losses of $20 Million </HL><AUTHOR> Scott McMurray (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BIO SCR CMD </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Futures speculator Richard J. Dennis, for years one of the most influential players in the Chicago markets, said he has decided to exit the business for good following multimillion dollar trading losses this year.    The 39-year-old trader, who has amassed a fortune of more than $200 million, said he is quitting to devote himself full-time to liberal politics. The rotund philosophy major said he hasn't decided how to &quot;channel&quot; his political interests, although he ruled out running for office. He said he might buy or start a magazine as a way to promote his brand of liberal social policy laced with free market economics.    Mr. Dennis said that personal 1988 losses totaling $20 million, including $8 million lost trading soybean futures on July 18, weren't a major factor in his decision. Two public commodity funds he managed also were racked by losses this year. They were forced to halt trading this spring after they lost about 50% of their value, or more than $50 million.    The departure of one of the industry's most influential figures surprised many futures traders.    &quot;I was surprised by the news. He's a very big trader, and over the years he has done very well,&quot; said Tone Grant, president of Refco Group Ltd., one of the largest futures trading companies in Chicago.    But some traders said they have come to expect the unexpected from Mr. Dennis, a reclusive iconoclast who has never fit the futures industry's image of boisterous conservatism.    Mr. Dennis has been one of the most active and successful futures traders ever. His huge trades of 1,000 or more contracts at a time regularly sent futures prices soaring or plunging in seconds. Rumors of trades he might be making, or technical trends in price or trading volume that he might be following, often were enough to shake the markets.    Soybean futures traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said that Mr. Dennis's huge trades often added to the volatility in soybean futures prices this year.    Mr. Dennis said that his retirement from trading didn't mean he thought lone speculators, the backbone of the futures markets for more than a century, stand less of a chance of surviving in today's increasingly volatile markets.    But he confided in an earlier interview that computerized trading systems used by the growing number of public futures trading funds often overwhelmed his own trading decisions. &quot;You can't beat the systems,&quot; he said, adding that part of his losses derived from overriding the trading decisions of his own computer systems, which he painstakingly developed over the years.    Mr. Dennis built a $1,600 loan from his father 18 years ago into a fortune of more than $200 million by making huge trades in futures and options markets ranging from pork bellies to Japanese yen. His market clout was so strong by the mid-1970s that he left the trading floor at the Chicago Board of Trade for an upstairs office to avoid roiling prices every time he shouldered his way into the commodity pits.    At the same time, Mr. Dennis, a native of Chicago's South Side working class neighborhoods, began supporting liberal causes and candidates. In 1982, he founded a liberal think tank in Washington, the Roosevelt Center for American Policy Studies. More recently, he was national co-chairman of Bruce Babbitt's presidential campaign.    He also has given $100,000 to support Michael Dukakis's presidential campaign.    Mr. Dennis &quot;is not a power broker in the traditional sense,&quot; said Mr. Babbitt, the former governor of Arizona who is currently an attorney practicing in Phoenix. &quot;He has a profound faith in the power of ideas to change our lives,&quot; Mr. Babbitt said.    In addition to his efforts at the national level, Mr. Dennis is also president of the Chicago Resource Center, a foundation concerned with human rights, and is part owner of the Chicago White Sox baseball team.    Mr. Dennis said that effective immediately he will be closing his accounts and selling all his exchange memberships. He is managing partner of Candamp;D Commodities, a commodities trading partnership, and chairman of Richard J. Dennis andamp; Co., a commodities trading adviser.    Mr. Dennis said that the two public funds he managed were recently relaunched, but after losing about 4% of their capital they most likely will be disbanded and the money left in them returned to investors. </TEXT></DOC>
