(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Navy investigator has begundeliberating on whether five swimming instructors and a commandingofficer should be court-martialed for a recruit's death during atraining program.   A Navy prosecutor contended Wednesday in his closing argumentsthat the use of force to stop Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki fromquitting the elite rescue swimmer training program was a crime.   ``These men were not malicious, they were hardened,'' said Lt.Cmdr Larry D. Wynne in his closing arguments. ``They were notvicious; they were indifferent. They saw, saw but did notperceive.''   Five of Mirecki's instructors at the Pensacola Naval Air Stationrescue swimmer school and its commanding officer should becourt-martialed, Wynne contended as attorneys concluded their casesin the four-day investigative hearing.   Cmdr. Daniel J. D'Alesio Jr., the investigator, will make arecommendation on the court-martial charges to Rear Adm. DavidMorris, chief of naval air training, at a later date.   Morris, based in Corpus Christi, Texas, has 120 days after theMay 10 filing of the charges to begin court-martial proceedings, ifthat is his choice. Other options are non-judicial punishment ordismissal of the charges.   The 19-year-old recruit from Appleton, Wis., died March 2 afterallegedly being forced back into a pool when he tried to quitduring a drill.   A pathologist testified that Mirecki, who suffered heart failurebefore he drowned, had a phobia about being pulled under water andliterally was scared to death. Classmates were ordered to turntheir backs on the pool and sing the national anthem before Mireckicollapsed, witnesses said.   The instructors charged with involuntary manslaughter are PettyOfficers 1st Class Richard E. Blevins and David J. Smith and PettyOfficers 2nd Class Frankie D. Deaton, John W. Zelenock and MichaelW. Combe.   Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, the officer in charge of the school, isaccused of dereliction of duty.   Mirecki had a right to quit, and the Uniform Code of MilitaryJustice prohibited the use of force against him, Wynne said.   Defense lawyers argued that pushing scared, exhausted ormalingering trainees into the pool or pulling them off its wallswas an accepted practice. ``This is the Navy,'' said Lt. Julie L.Hoving, Deaton's lawyer. ``The students must be forced to theirlimits.''   She and other defense counsel contended that failure to useforce to simulate the stress of an actual rescue in bad weather orcombat situation would not adequately prepare students and couldendanger them and those they are trying to save.   Wynne said Torchia was in his office overlooking the pool 100feet away when Mirecki was being pushed in. He contended theofficer could see and hear what was happening but did nothing.   Torchia's lawyers introduced a report on a lie detector testindicating he was telling the truth when he said he was taking atelephone call from headquarters in Washington, and neither saw norheard what was going on.   Witnesses testified Mirecki had tried to quit training a monthbefore he died and subsequently was classified by a flight surgeonas unfit to continue because he had a phobia about being draggedunder water.   A clinical psychologist disagreed with the finding, and Mireckiwas returned to training through a series of errors withoutobtaining a required physical examination and a flight surgeon'sapproval, witnesses said.</TEXT></DOC>
