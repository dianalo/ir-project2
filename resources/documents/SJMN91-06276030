The deal could endMicrosoft Corp.'s dominance in operating systems and Intel Corp.'s ownershipof the microprocessor market, and help Apple realize its frustrated dream ofacceptance by big business buyers.;   Apple Chief Executive John Sculley andIBM President Jack Kuehler today are expected to lay out the framework of oneof the major parts of the deal, a joint venture to develop an advancedcomputer operating system based on a four-year-old Apple project code-namedPink. Apple has already produced over a million lines of programming workingon Pink, Sculley said at an industry conference last week.;   The jointventure will have a seven-member board of directors, said analyst Tim Bajarinof Creative Strategies International. He said it would include two directorsfrom Apple, two from IBM, and three chosen from outside the companies. It willbe headed by David Liddle, who founded Metaphor Computer Systems, whichearlier this year created a joint venture with IBM called Patriot Partners andwas subsequently bought by IBM.;   But Liddle's role will be that of&quot;evangelist,&quot; promoting the venture to outsiders, said Nancy McSharry, ananalyst with International Data Corp. The day-to-day management of the jointventure will fall to Apple veteran Ed Birss, who was favored by those Appleemployees who will make up the bulk of the 100 to 150 people expected to workin the Cupertino-based venture, said an Apple source familiar with thenegotiations.;   Only a few posts will be open to programmers now working atPatriot Partners. &quot;All the Patriot Partners people have to re-interview fortheir jobs,&quot; McSharry said.;   Despite some early concerns that the jointventures could pose some federal anti-trust problems, the Apple source saidthe companies were confident regulators would not oppose the deal. &quot;The FTC(Federal Trade Commission) has had (details) for a while and they haven't saidanything about having a problem with it,&quot; the source said.;   Apple and IBMare also expected to discuss other details of the agreement, including asecond joint venture to oversee collaboration on so-called multimediaproducts. The companies also have agreed to use the same chip in futurecomputers that use the Pink-based software. It will be a version of IBM's RISCmicroprocessor now employed in its RS/6000 work stations.;   The chip will bemanufactured by Motorola, whose top officials also will speak at today's pressconference.;   &quot;This is not smoke and mirrors,&quot; Sculley said during a speechat an industry conference Monday. &quot;This is the real stuff. With RISC-basedtechnology for the Macintosh we'll reach up into areas of the greatest needfor high-end users.&quot;;   The companies also have said they will cooperate ondeveloping products to connect Apple's Macintosh personal computers with thelarge IBM computers that are widely used in big business.;   &quot;Apple wants todispel once and for all the notion that it can't market to corporate America,&quot;said Douglas Kass, an analyst with Dataquest in San Jose.; AREAS OF ALLIANCE;IBM and Apple have said they will cooperate in four broad areas:;(box)Operating systems: The two will form a joint venture to develop softwarefor next-generation computers. The software will be based on a current Appleproject called Pink.; (box)Multimedia: The partners will launch another jointventure to collaborate on &quot;multimedia&quot; computing, which combines features oftraditional computers with video, audio, animation and communications.;(box)Microprocessors: Apple and IBM agreed to jointly use in future machines aversion of IBM's RISC microprocessor that will be manufactured by Motorola.IBM now uses the chip in its RS/6000 work stations.; (box)Networking: The pairwill cooperate on making it easier to connect Apple's Macintosh computers toIBM mainframes, paving the way for increased acceptance of Apple personalcomputers in large businesses.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RORY J.
