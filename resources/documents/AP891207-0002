(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State game officials are no dummies,but the same can't be said for the deer they used to nab poachers.   For the second straight year, officers from the state's Divisionof Natural Resources used fake deer against hunters who stop alonghighways to shoot at deer illegally.   Last year, one bogus buck in Braxton County bamboozled 30would-be hunters into taking potshots. This year, conservationofficers caught 82 shooters at two locations.   ``We were hoping that the publicity would act as a deterrent tothose hunters who like to cruise the roads looking for deer,'' saidMaj. Bill Daniel of the agency's law enforcement division. ``Ithink it worked. I'm sure it saved some real deer.''   Most of the arrests were for shooting from the road or fortrespassing on private property.   Daniel said one decoy was set up in a privately owned fieldmarked with ``No Hunting'' signs.   ``We had some guys who would jump out of their cars, run over tothe fence and use the signs as gun rests,'' Daniel said.   Such antics often left conservation officers laughing so hardthat they had to pause to compose themselves before moving in tomake arrests. Daniel still chuckles about one incident.   ``One car pulled up and four guys came rolling out of it withtheir guns,'' he said. ``Three of them took up positions outsidethe fence while the other one sneaked in toward the decoy.   ``Finally, the guy got within 30 yards or so of the deer, stoodup and fired. He looked at the decoy, still just standing there,and I think he began to get the idea that something was wrong.   ``He walked over to the decoy and just reached out and touchedit. About that time, we hit the siren and moved in. You've neverseen a more dejected or more hang-dog expression on anyone in yourlife. His buddies were laughing their brains out.''</TEXT><DATELINE>COGGON, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Your run-of-the-mill lounge lizard willstill be roaming bars, but the Coggon City Council intends todecide whether an undersized alligator can frequent a tavern.   A hearing will be held next month to discuss whether Crosby thealligator can be the mascot of Crosby's Cove, a tavern recentlypurchased by Crosby's best friend and feeder, Jim Schebler of CedarRapids.   Tuesday night, Schebler lobbied the City Council to amend thecity's dangerous animal ordinance, which prohibits bobcats, polarbears, alligators and other wild critters within the city limits.   Council discussion showed a general reluctance to amend theordinance to allow alligators less than 3{ feet long if in asecured container.   But Councilman Richard Foye supported the change, agreeing withSchebler that dogs could be more dangerous than a locked-upalligator.   ``I'm not worried about his alligator snipping off my kids'toes,'' Foye said. ``They shouldn't be in the tavern anyway.''   Mayor Bob Trumbull encouraged drafting the amendment and havinga hearing Jan. 2.   Schebler wants to keep the alligator, now 2 feet long, in thebar to attract customers.</TEXT></DOC>
