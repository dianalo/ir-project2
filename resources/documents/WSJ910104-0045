From Alaska's North Slope to the aged fields of WestTexas, petroleum producers are investing millions of dollarsin improved oil recovery -- unconventional technologydesigned to wring more crude from existing wells.</LP><TEXT>   Ordinary drilling methods tap only about 15% of a typicalwell's potential, and until recently it was difficult tojustify chasing after the rest. Now, however, crude isselling at a high enough price, and has been doing so longenough, for oil companies to sink serious money intoextracting every barrel possible. Consider:   -- In Kansas, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. recently spent $3million on a special recovery system that raised theproduction of one field to 3,800 barrels a day from a mere70. At $25 a barrel, that works out to a $35 million annualpayoff, compared with revenue of far less than $1 millionbefore. &quot;This is exceptional,&quot; admits Michael Bridges, anAnadarko engineer. But it's no fluke, and Anadarko ispreparing similar projects in two nearby fields.   -- Chevron Corp. planned to spend an extra $100 millionlast year to increase its oil production, most of it goinginto existing wells in California's San Joaquin valley. Thecompany hopes to increase daily crude production there by asmuch as 8,000 barrels.   -- British Petroleum Co. and Atlantic Richfield Co. aretreating wells in Alaska with special materials in hopes ofincreasing output there by 50,000 barrels a day. The costcould hit $42 million, but the productivity of some wells mayjump 500%.   &quot;The economics are very compelling&quot; for such schemes now,says Paul Leibman, a Denver oil analyst. The oil-price runupsince August has certainly whetted producers' appetites forsuch projects. But enhanced recovery was actually on theupswing well before the Persian Gulf crisis began, reflectinga steady rise of oil prices into the $20-a-barrel range fromthe low teens over the past year or so.   The long-range outlook is for a continued gradual rise indemand and prices over the decade. &quot;While there's a lot ofuncertainty about where oil prices will settle out (after thecrisis) . . . we're talking about something higher thanbefore the invasion,&quot; predicts Mr. Leibman. Oil closedyesterday at $25.48.   The cost of enhanced recovery technology varies widely,though most common methods range between $5 and $10 a barrel.Right now, the magic number for justifying projects seems tobe $20 a barrel. At that price, an additional 3.3 billionbarrels of crude reserves become available in the U.S. With$28 oil, experts calculate, an extra 8.7 billion barrelsbecome economically feasible; at $32, about 10.6 billion morebarrels are available.   Such increases could slow the overall decline in U.S.crude production, and to some extent ease America'sdependence on foreign crude. After all, over the past fiveyears more than 100,000 U.S. wells were simply abandoned whenoutput dropped too low, instead of having their remainingpotential tapped. When abandoned wells are plugged withcement, any oil left behind is effectively lost for good.   Wringing more oil from operating wells isn't a newconcept. Producers have known for some time that introducingsubstances deep into underground formations can promote theflow of oil to the surface.   For example, water forced into crevices in subterraneanrocks can flush oil out and then, because the oil is lighter,push it up a nearby well. On the West Coast, where crudetends to be gooier, producers are using a variation: Theyinject steam underground to thin and loosen trapped oil. InWest Texas and New Mexico, Phillips Petroleum Co. is usingcarbon dioxide and readily available natural gas to flush outstubborn oil.   More advanced procedures are being developed. In a new&quot;microbial&quot; process, microscopic organisms are pumped down awell along with molasses, a nutrient, and sealed inside for afew weeks. A sort of fermentation takes place that yieldsvarious chemicals, including detergents and surfactants. Whenwater is added, these then promote an emulsion that enhancesproduction.   One experimental method takes an entirely mechanicalapproach. Appropriately called &quot;gravity drainage,&quot; it relieson specialized drilling techniques to maneuver below a knownoil-bearing formation and then penetrate it from underneath.Hard-to-get oil simply leaks down into what amounts to anunderground sump. From there it is pumped to the surface.   Even tried-and-true processes are constantly beingrefined. The oil in one of Mitchell Energy andamp; DevelopmentCorp.'s East Texas fields is the consistency of molasses, andordinary water pumped in &quot;tends to go right through it ratherthan pushing it,&quot; says Charles Brashares, manager of enhancedrecovery. To make the water &quot;heavier,&quot; Mitchell treats itwith chemicals. The company figures the process may raiseoutput fourfold.   Regardless of technology, enhanced recovery projects canbe complex. In Kansas, Anadarko is relying on ordinarywater-flooding, but was stymied at first by a lack of supply.Now Anadarko filters and treats some 420,000 gallons a day ofwater from a sewage-treatment plant in Liberal, Kan., andthen injects it into its oilfield.   In Kern County, Calif., oil fields, where Texaco Inc. andothers use steam-flooding to recover heavy crude from porousrocks, a maze of steam generators and steel pipes covers thesurface. Below ground, steam pumped down &quot;injection wells&quot;into the crude reservoir thins the oil and moves it towardnearby producing wells. Companies there have devised specialpatterns of steam-injection wells and oil-producing wells formaximum effect. One favorite is the &quot;five-spot,&quot; a steam wellsurrounded by four oil wells.   Husky Oil Ltd. of Calgary, Canada, faces big logisticalproblems in a $20 million steam recovery project due to startthere next month. The oil involved is especially thick: &quot;Youcan practically walk on this stuff,&quot; says Bob Wilson, a Huskymanager. Plus, water is scarce, so 90% of the steam injectedmust be recycled.   To help with that, Husky devised a &quot;huff-and-puff&quot;process, in which injections of steam from huge oil-firedboilers will alternate with periods when the loosened oil isallowed to flow back up.   Those aren't the only problems. The oil is inside aforested, hard-to-reach weapons range used by the Canadianair force. &quot;Our cost of operation would make a Californiaengineer gag,&quot; Mr. Wilson says.   Still, Husky thinks it will be worthwhile. &quot;We'reexpecting production in the range of 50 to 100 barrels perday, per well,&quot; says Mr. Wilson. With 24 wells, that's 1,200to 2,000 barrels a day.   As with other enhanced recovery projects, Husky's wellswon't keep producing at those high rates for as long asordinary wells often flow. Mr. Wilson says peak productionshould occur a year after start-up; then output will tail offgradually.   Fluids and chemicals used in enhanced recovery do poseenvironmental risks. If they aren't managed well they &quot;couldcause damage to the soil,&quot; says James Pautz, a researcher forthe National Institute for Petroleum and Energy Research inBartlesville, Okla.   But oil officials say they try hard to avoid problems. Forone thing, materials pumped into wells to enhance productionare injected too far underground to pollute water tables,says Don De Mott of Chevron, who sells chemicals used in someof the processes.   In addition, producers say they keep close tabs on theirwastes. When Husky Oil finally disposes of its recycledwater, says Mr. Wilson, it pumps it into an 1,800-foot well,below the oil production zone. &quot;We have an extensive networkof ground-water monitoring wells to detect any impairmentsthat might result from a subsurface leak or spill,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
