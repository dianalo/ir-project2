Maj. Gen. Mohammad Farouk Zarif, 39, is the brother ofAfghanistan's former U.N. ambassador, Farid Zarif, one of Najib'sclosest advisers.   The general, the highest-ranking military defector thePakistan-based insurgents have ever paraded in public, said thatNajib's government was weak.   ``If the Russians cut off all supplies to Najib, he'd be finishedin two or three months,'' Zarif told a news conference.   U.S. and Western diplomats in Peshawar, near Pakistan's borderwith Afghanistan, confirmed the man at the news conference was Zarifand his position as former chief of security for Najib and other topofficials.   The U.S. special envoy to the Afghan rebels, Peter Thomsen,hinted in July of a major military defection from Afghanistan.   Zarif said he fled the war-torn country in June after serving 18months as chief of the 3,000-strong government security force whichprotects Najib and the Afghan Politburo. He gave no details of howhe left.   Speaking Persian through an interpreter, Zarif said his wife andtwo children were with him in Pakistan, but they were consideringseeking political asylum in the United States.   Zarif said he felt disillusioned by the ruling People'sDemocratic Party of Afghanistan, which seized power in a 1978military coup.   ``At the time I thought the party would serve through aparliamentary campaign, would enact land reforms, literacy programs,social services and provide social justice to a variety of ethnicgroups,'' Zarif said. ``But unfortunately, its real actions broughtabout exactly the opposite.''   He indicated he had information that could breach Najib'ssecurity but refused to say whether he had given it to theU.S.-backed rebels, called mujahedeen or Islamic ``holy warriors.''   Zarif said the president's personal security staff included twoSoviet advisers who dealt mainly with technical and communicationsproblems.   He claimed military morale in Afghanistan was low despite theguerrillas' failure to capture a major city since the Feb. 15completion of the withdrawal of some 103,000 Soviet combat troops.   Zarif said the guerrilla's stalled offensive on the eastern cityof Jalalabad, which began March 6, was not typical of Afghandefenses.   ``Najib concentrated all military attention toward Jalalabad.There was a continual resupply,'' he said, adding that militaryunits were deployed from elsewhere in the country to defend the city.   Zarif said he doubted the guerrillas would meet the same responseif they were to attack other government-held cities including Kabul,the capital.   His appearance marked the opening of the Media InformationDepartment of Islamic Afghanistan, a public relations unit of themujahedeen's own self-proclaimed government in exile.   The U.S.-backed rebels, the most powerful of which are based inthe Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar, are fighting to topple theSoviet-backed Kabul regime and establish an Islamic republic ofAfghanistan.   Communist forces hold the capital and most of Afghanistan's keycities but mujahedeen control most of the countryside.   The guerrillas recently have stepped up rocket attacks on Kabul,reportedly with new, multi-head missiles supplied by the UnitedStates.   Soviet forces entered Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the Marxistgovernment and fight the rebellion. Moscow agreed to withdraw lastyear under a U.N. accord and completed the troop pullout in February.   Western diplomats predicted that the rebels, who control much ofthe countryside, would overrun major cities in a matter of months,but government forces supplied with Soviet arms have managed torebuff rebel attacks.</TEXT></DOC>
