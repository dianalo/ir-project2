(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Where Best To System InvestandM;A medium-sized manufacturing firm, having experienced substantialproductivity gains on its shop floor, recently invested $3 million intechnology to get a similar improvement in its office operations.andP;  Thecompany's goals were to reduce the clerical work force by 10%, to shorten theresponse time to customer complaints and to managements' requests forinformation, and to improve communication among senior staff members.andM;After a year of struggling with the new technology, the firm found that ithad been forced to increase its technical staff.andP;  But the response times toinformation requests remained about the same.andP;  Communication among seniormanagers was only moderately improved.andP;  Worst of all, only half of the newequipment was being used.andM;The company's goals were not unreasonable.andP;  Experts in office automationalways list increased productivity, expanded work capabilities and higherlevels of satisfaction for both employees and clients among the benefits ofputting computer and communications technology into the office.andP;  Buttechnology that improves efficiency without improving the organization'sbottom line and overall system performance may be inappropriate.andP;  Forexample, improving a typist's efficiency when the typist is used only 75% ofthe time is money ill spent.andM;Surprisingly, certain techniques used to analyze the overall performance ofshop floor production systems can be applied to office technologies, despitethe belief that the two work environments are essentially different.andP;  Thesemethods analyze the complete system emphasizing throughput, operatingexpenses and inventory over efficiency, utilization and output.andM;One production floor technique, called Management by Constraints (MBC),developed by E.M.andP;  Goldratt, focuses on adjusting system constraints tooptimize the overall performance of an office system.andP;  A system constraint isanything that prevents the system from reaching its stated performance goals.andO;The basic premise of MBC is that higher returns may be gained by investing inthe constraining resource instead of the nonconstraining resource.andO;Increasing production capacity for resources that are not constraints on theprocess typically leads to excess inventory without improving overall systemperformance.andM;Furthermore, the MBC method says that most often it is preferable to adjustthe system so its constraining resource is its most expensive resource or isan external resource.andP;  For example, in a dentist's office many officeprocedures could be automated, such as the compilation and maintenance ofmailing lists and the storage and retrieval of patient data storage.andP;  But thegoal should be to make the most expensive resource, in this case thedentist's activities, the constraining resource.andM;To accomplish this goal, Goldratt has defined seven steps that focusrecursively on the constraints that inhibit gains in performance.andP;  Thosesteps are:andM;* Identify the goal of the system.andM;* Identify appropriate measures for achieving those goals.andM;* Identify the system constraint.andM;* Decide how to exploit the system constraint.andM;* Subordinate all of the system to the above decision.andM;* Elevate the constraint and, once the constraint is adjusted.andM;* Reevaluate the system to ensure it is set up correctly.andM;1 Identify the Goal of theandM;System.andM;Many analysts tend to focus on the performance of only one component of asystem.andP;  Although each component has its own goal, it must be consonant withthe organization's goal and the system goal.andP;  For most organizations, both ofthose overall goals are to make the endeavor profitable.andP;  Improvements thatdo not help get goods and services out the door at an appropriate cost willcreate a negative impact on the bottom line.andP;  For example, creating a systemto build up inventory is of no help if new customers are not being recruitedat the same time.andM;The goal of our hypothetical dentist is to be profitable while providingexcellent quality dental care for his patients.andP;  Although our dentist has athriving practice, he realizes that the number of clients with dental decayis decreasing due to the use of fluoride and are requiring his highly skilledtasks less frequently.andP;  Wary about the future, he wonders whether computertechnology could make his office more productive while reducing his costs.andM;2 Identify AppropriateandM;System PerformanceandM;Measures for MeetingandM;the Organization's GoalandM;Human behavior is strongly influenced by the measures set up to evaluate thatbehavior.andP;  Therefore, the measures used to evaluate performance within theprocess must be in line with the system goal.andP;  The measures must be globalrather than local, as global measures provide incentives for coordinatingeach of the subunits in the system.andP;  To be considered, any technologicaladvance should have a positive impact on one of these measures.andM;We have selected five global measures three from the MBC approach and two ofour own, that can be used to realize the system goal: throughput, operatingexpenses, inventory, lead time and quality.andM;The first measure, throughput, refers to the amount of goods and servicesactually sold to a customer.andP;  Output differs from throughput in that itincludes all unsold goods and services.andP;  Many managers mistake output forthroughput, believing that merely creating the product creates profits forthe organization.andP;  They forget that a product without a customer has to bestored, a costly proposition.andM;Our dentist's throughput corresponds most directly to the number of patientshe sees in a day.andP;  Since dental patients are rarely turned away, thedentists' output is typically equivalent to his throughput.andM;The second measure, operating expenses, is the area in which traditionaloffice automation analyses most often predict unrealized savings.andP;  Typically,such analyses assume that costs will automatically be reduced if automationcan save an employee time.andP;  However, if the employee's newfound time is notused to modify throughput in a positive way, operating expenses will not bedecreased.andP;  In fact, costs could grow higher if the new technology requiresadditional maintenance or operating personnel.andP;  For example, installing apatient-scheduling system should be done only if it gives an office managertime to provide better customer service.andM;The third measure, inventory, represents money invested in raw materials,work in process and finished goods.andP;  Although some inventory is necessary,lower inventory reduces expenses and improves profits.andP;  The dangers of excessinventory are well known: damage, theft, spoilage and obsolescence.andM;Our dentist's inventory primarily takes the form of the number of clients inthe office waiting for service.andP;  This value should neither be zero nor solarge that customers decide to leave.andM;The important fourth measure, lead time, refers to the response delay betweenthe time a customer requests a product or service and the time he or shereceives it.andP;  Short lead times can provide a competitive advantage.andM;In the dentist's office lead time is the difference between the time a personcalls for service and the time of the appointment.andP;  The ultimate objective isto get the lead time close to zero.andM;The last measure, quality, is a multidimensional concept that depends on theprocess used in creating the product or service.andM;Quality dental work is reflected in a number of ways, such as the number ofpatient complaints, the appearance of the work and the degree of interactionbetween the dentist and the patient.andM;How does improved performance by these five measures translate into apositive return on our office technology investment--a profitable office?andO;The first three measures--increases in throughput, decreases in operatingexpenses and a drop in inventory--can be reflected immediately in the cashflow of the organization and, ultimately, the company balance sheet.andP;  The twoother measures are more difficult to relate as directly to the company'sfinancial health.andP;  However, both decreases in lead times and improvements inquality generate positive changes in sales and market share over a longertime frame.andM;3 Identify the SystemandM;ConstraintandM;System constraints can be either internal or external.andP;  An externalconstraint could be the market--it may simply not want all the products theorganization produces.andP;  An internal constraint can be a department, such asfinance or purchasing; an individual who is carrying an inordinately heavywork load; or a machine, such as a copier or a fax machine.andM;These constraints can be identified in many ways.andP;  Perhaps the simplest butmost effective is to ask office workers which aspects of the work environmentrestrict their work flow.andP;  A second technique is to visit the work site,allowing the analyst to see where system constraints are causing mountains ofinventory to build up.andP;  If the dentist is waiting for patients to arrive, itis clear that some other aspect of the office's operation is the constrainingresource.andM;Analytical techniques also can be useful.andP;  Work load analysis identifies themost utilized resource, which typically is also one of the constraints on thesystem.andP;  Another analytical technique is to contrast the resources used bythe jobs that are overdue with the jobs that are on time.andP;  The resourcesinvolved in the late jobs are usually the bottlenecks.andM;4 Decide How To ExploitandM;the System Constraint.andM;The notion behind exploiting the system constraint is to improve theperformance measures without changing the production capacity of the existingsystem.andP;  One way is to assure that the constraining resource is used 100% ofits available time.andP;  For example, the dentist should work at his desired ratewithoiut having to waste time waiting for patients to arrive.andM;The second way to exploit the system constraint is to reformulate the mix ofproducts that flows through that resource so it will increase the overallprofitability of the organization.andP;  For example, assuming the dentist werethe constraint, he could increase revenues by performing more of the costlywork that takes the same amount of time as less costly work.andM;Finding an acceptable mix may be difficult.andP;  Often, the products that passthrough an organization vary widely, with each requiring attention by theconstraining resource for reasons other than profitability.andM;5 Subordinate OtherandM;System Decisions to theandM;Above DecisionandM;The MBC perspective envisions the constraining resource as the drum of thesystem, with the other system components marching in step to its beat.andO;Accordingly, if the dentist is the constraining resource, the office managerand dental assistant should adjust to the dentist's rate of work.andP;  The officemanager shouldn't schedule as many patients as possible; rather, the managershould book only as many patients as the dentist can serve.andP;  Similarly, thedental assistant should prepare only as many compounds for patching teeth asthe dentist requires.andM;Similarly, if the dental assistant is the constraining resource patientsshould be scheduled so that the assistant is able to serve each of themadequately.andP;  This could result in the dentist being idle for periods duringthe day.andP;  If this constraint is unacceptable, step six, &quot;elevate theconstraint,&quot; may be required.andM;6 Elevate the SystemandM;Constraint.andM;Once the system is working as effectively as possible with the currentconstraint, the goal should be to overcome that constraint and furtherimprove the system.andM;Two ways to improve the system capacity are either to hire additionalpersonnel or to purchase technological resources that will support theconstraining resource.andP;  For example, if the dental assistant is unable toperform the work quickly enough, another assistant could be hired ortechnological support could be provided to improve the assistant'sperformance.andP;  If the office manager finds it difficult to keep track ofpatient schedules, a user-friendly scheduling system with automatic promptsand alerts could help.andP;  The goal is to elevate the constraint until itbecomes the most costly resource; in our example, the dentist.andP;  If a resourceis to remain idle, it should be the lower cost resource, such as the dentalassistant or the office manager.andM;If the dentist is the constraint, a system that would allow him to easilyretrieve and update patient records might be in order.andP;  Such equipment couldreduce his time spent with patients, improving throughput.andP;  It could alsoimprove the quality of the dentist's service by enhancing his interactionwith patients.andP;  In this situation, office technology should not be applied tohelp the office manager or the dental assistant, unless it improvesperformance of one or more of the five measures.andP;  Purchasing a computersystem to reduce the time it takes to send out bills is not fruitful if theoffice manager already has slack time.andM;A second way to elevate the constraint is to make organizational changes tothe system, such as off loading some of the activities performed by theconstraining resource to other system resources.andP;  The dental assistant, forexample, could be asked to perform less-skilled dental functions, such ascleaning.andM;In more traditional approaches, such a strategy may not be considered.andP;  Incost accounting, for example, overhead is typically assigned on the basis ofhours worked, which discourages the transfer of a task from an efficientresource to a less efficient one.andP;  But the MBC system makes clear that it maynot be important for the dental assistant who takes on the task to do it asefficiently as the dentist could.andP;  The MBC's global cost/benefit analysis mayinstead reveal that, by off loading the task from the constraining resource,a better opportunities exists for increasing throughput and, ultimately,increasing profits.andM;7 Go Back to StepandM;Three--Reevaluate theandM;System To Ensure It IsandM;Set Up CorrectlyandM;The goal in this MBC analysis is to end with the constraint at a desiredlocation.andP;  Thus, once a system has been evaluated and desired changes havebeen made, the system should be reevalauted to determine which resource hasbecome the new constraint.andP;  If it is not where the organization wishes it tobe, the process should be repeated to identify the new system consraint andplace it where desired.andM;A major reason for the failure of office automation to produce expectedbenefits is a breakdown in the analysis process.andP;  Analysis using theManagement by Constraints approach can provide the proper focus needed forinvesting in truly appropriate office technologies.andM;Most important, MBC points out the danger inherent in applying IS technologyto areas that are not constraints on the system.andP;  Implementing any technologyin an organization is a difficult process and, if it is not needed (somethingthe workers quickly discover), the technology will not be used.andM;Barry Floyd is an assistant professor of information systems at the SternSchool of Business, New York University Boaz Ronen is a lecturer oninformation systems at the Faculty of Management at Tel Aviv University.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
