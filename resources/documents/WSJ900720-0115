ATandamp;T said it also paid heavily trying to keep up withdemand for its new Universal credit card, which has garneredat least two million cardholders since its unveiling inMarch.</LP><TEXT>   Net fell to $657 million, or 60 cents a share, from $699million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to$9.03 billion from $9.26 billion.   In the first half, net rose 2.4% to $1.33 billion, or$1.22 a share, from $1.29 billion, or $1.20 a share, the yearbefore. Sales of $17.92 billion were unchanged.   ATandamp;T's results were expected after it announced last monththat earnings would decline. Since that announcement, thecompany's stock, which had been hovering in the low 40s, hasfallen to the mid-30s. In New York Stock Exchange compositetrading yesterday, ATandamp;T rose 50 cents to $37.625 on volume of1.9 million shares.   Despite the bland profit performance, ATandamp;T Chairman RobertE. Allen said, &quot;We still expect 1990 to be better than 1989,a record earnings year. These results don't alter ourconfidence in our direction or our future prospects.&quot;   Included in the results were charges of about $100 millionto cover consolidations, layoffs and other costs in ATandamp;T'sservices businesses, including long-distance and maintenanceand installation.   ATandamp;T also took a charge of about $290 million to coverconsolidations and personnel reallocations in microelectronicparts and systems and for reclaiming scrap metal.   All this was offset by a credit of $400 million, whichcame from a net reduction in the reserves set up in December1988 associated with modernization of ATandamp;T's network. ATandamp;Tattributed the reduction to lower removal and disposal costsof obsolete equipment. The company said the reduction wouldhave been even greater if not for increased costs from forcereductions and facilities closings.   Sales of equipment continued to be hurt by a slowdown inthe business market. While sales of switching andtransmission equipment to phone companies inched ahead 1.8%to $1.8 billion, other equipment sales suffered. Business,data and consumer equipment revenue fell 11% to $1.7 billion.ATandamp;T doesn't break out its profit for its equipmentbusinesses, but analysts estimate the company is losing morethan $300 million a year on office phone systems and computerequipment.   On the services side, long-distance revenue fell 3.9% to$4.8 billion from $5.02 billion. ATandamp;T attributed the declineto $100 million in additional payments to the local phonecompanies for completing long-distance calls over their localnetworks, and a shift by an undisclosed number of businesscustomers to newer, lower-priced communications services.   Still, Morris Tanenbaum, ATandamp;T vice chairman and chieffinancial officer, was optimistic about long-distanceoperations. He noted that ATandamp;T's traffic volume grew 7%, anindication that it has begun to stanch a loss of business toits primary competitors, MCI Communications Corp. and USSprint Communications Co., a unit of UnitedTelecommunications Inc.   &quot;We don't see any decrease in overall strength of themarket, said Mr. Tanenbaum. &quot;And our profitability remainsstrong.&quot;   Jack Grubman, analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said thequarter &quot;was probably better than expected,&quot; given thatproduct sales decreased a meager 2% in a very tough pricingenvironment and &quot;their margins of 43% are the highest they'vebeen in three years.&quot; Moreover, he said ATandamp;T's long-distancevolume grew 15% to 20% in the small-business arena, where MCIand Sprint have experienced sluggishness.</TEXT></DOC>
