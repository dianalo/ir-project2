Previous investments and averageproduction figures show coal production to be profitable. This is supportedby a clear increase, since 1980, in the size of mines, in the level ofmechanisation and in the requirement for further investment in developmentand exploration. There are significant indications providing a soundbasis for the interest of small and medium-sized private sector companiesin the coal industry. The 'Compendium of Chilean Mining 1985-1986' showsthat in 1985 and 1986, there were respectively 17 and 20 mining companiesset up in the country to mine and market coal with a share capital of300 and 200 thousand dollars respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
