BoardAdopts Anti-Takeover Plan</HL><DD> 12/18/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> RYL </IN><DATELINE> COLUMBIA, Md.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ryland Group Inc. said its board adopted a shareholder rights plan to deter hostile takeovers.    Terms of the plan call for the distribution of one common-stock purchase right for each common share held as of Jan. 12.    Charles E. Peck, chairman and chief executive officer of Ryland, said he didn't know of any attempt to take over the company.    Under the plan, each right will entitle holders to buy one common share at $70. The rights will be exercisable only if 20% or more of the home-building concern is acquired, or if there is an announcement of a tender or exchange offer for more than 30% of the company.    After the rights become exercisable, they may under certain conditions be used to buy common shares of an acquiring company with a value equal to twice the exercise price. </TEXT></DOC>
