Charges brought against Herbert Zinn Jr., 18, of Chicago, signalthe start of ``an aggressive position toward computer crimes,''Valukas said.   The government also accused the young man of advertising on acomputer bulletin board how to electronically break into ATandamp;T'scomputers. He was charged in a criminal information.   Zinn is accused of committing the crimes when he was a juvenile,and could be sent to prison until his 21st birthday in August 1991.   He could not be reached Tuesday at his North Side residence,where his telephone went unanswered.   Federal agents raided his home last year and confiscated threecomputers and software allegedly stolen during the electronicbreak-ins, and Zinn has not pursued his computer techniques ``withquite the same vim and vigor,'' he told the Chicago Sun-Times.   He said he nonetheless hoped eventually to resume his schoolingand become an electonics engineer, the newspaper said. Zinn wouldnot discuss details of the case, it said.   The federal charges arose after Zinn had been arrested severaltimes, including for allegedly breaking into the computers at theKeller Graduate School of Management and at Commodity PerspectiveInc., both in Chicago.   ``Before and after the computer break-ins (at Keller andCommodity Perspective), Zinn was, by his own admission, breakinginto ATandamp;T computers,'' Valukas said.   Court documents indicate Zinn broke into an ATandamp;T computer at theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization's Maintenance and SupplyHeadquarters in Burlington, N.C., and an ATandamp;T computer at RobinsAir Force Base, Ga.   Software taken from NATO and the Air Force base were ``low levelin terms of sensitivity,'' Valukas said.   Agents raided Zinn's home after an ATandamp;T security officer tunedinto the so-called Phreak Class-2600 computer bulletin board andspotted messages signed by ``Shadow Hawk,'' a code name thegoverment said the teen-ager used.   In the messages, Shadow Hawk bragged that he had successfullygained access to ATandamp;T computer files. In another, similar message,Shadow Hawk made the mistake of including his telephone number,which was spotted by a security officer, the government said.   The purpose of the Texas-based Phreak Class-2600 is ``to educatecomputer enthusiasts ... to penetrate industrial and governmentsector computer systems,'' said William J. Cook, an assistant U.S.attorney.   Zinn also tried to electonically break into computers at theWashington Post's accounts payable department, a hospital in SouthBend, Ind.; and computers in Columbus, Ohio; Rye, N.Y. and PipeCreek, Texas, the government said.</TEXT></DOC>
