We haveutilized cultured glioma cells to show that linolenic acid, 18:3(n-3),is rapidly desaturated and chain elongated; 20:5(n-3) is the major productand accumulates almost exclusively in phospholipids. We examined effectsof various (n-6), (n-3), (n-9) and (n-7) fatty acids at 40 microM concentrationon desaturation and chain elongation processes using [1-{sup 14}C]18:3(n-3)as substrate. In general, monoenoic fatty acids were without effect.The (n-6) fatty acids (18:2, 18:3, 20:3, 20:4 and 22:4) had little effecton total product formed. There was a shift of labeled product to triacylglycerol,and in phospholipids, slightly enhanced conversion of 20:5 to 22:5 wasevident. In contrast, 22:6(n-3) was inhibitory, whereas 20:3(n-3) and20:5(n-3) had much less effect. At concentrations less than 75 microM,all acids were inhibitory. Most products were esterified to phosphatidylcholine,but phosphatidylethanolamine also contained a major portion of 20:5 and22:5. We provide a condensed overview of how the (n-6) and (n-3) fattyacids interact to modify relative rates of desaturation and chain elongation,depending on the essential fatty acid precursor. Thus, the balance betweenthese dietary acids can markedly influence enzymes providing crucialmembrane components and substrates for biologically active oxygenatedderivatives.</TEXT></DOC>
