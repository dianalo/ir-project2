The 105-member association, made up of smaller commercialbanks that heavily promote their community orientation, hasfiled a lawsuit to prevent a savings-bank group from usingthe name Community Bankers Association of New York State, atitle it adopted last week after having been known as theSavings Bank Association of New York State.</LP><TEXT>   The commercial banks contend that the savings banks aretrying to mislead the &quot;public, the financial community andeven our policy and lawmaking bodies&quot; by &quot;stealing&quot; the&quot;community bank&quot; label.   J. William Johnson, former president of the IndependentBankers and president of First National Bank of Long Island,declares: The savings banks &quot;are trying to take a name thatis really synonymous with our organization and our members.&quot;   &quot;That's absurd,&quot; replies Robert Lehrman, president andchief executive of the Community Bankers Association. &quot;It'sunfortunate that, considering the turbulence in the bankingindustry, we are being forced to engage in a debate over thename of a banking association.&quot; He adds that the Savings BankAssociation, which was founded in 1894, has been using the&quot;community bank&quot; description longer than the IndependentBankers, which was founded in 1974.   But John Pritchard, executive director of the IndependentBankers, says, &quot;The name change is an attempt to mislead andblur the connection of the savings institutions to the newlynamed association.&quot; The commercial banks don't want thesavings banks to take on the name &quot;community banks&quot; becausethey don't want to be linked to the problems ofsavings-and-loan institutions. &quot;We're trying to separateourselves,&quot; says Mr. Pritchard. &quot;If there are problems in thefuture with the Sandamp;Ls, we don't want to be affiliated withthat part of the industry. We've got a clean record, and wewant to keep it that way.&quot;   State Supreme Court Justice Paul Cheeseman will hold ahearing tomorrow on the suit.   Mr. Pritchard, meanwhile, sees a possible solution. &quot;Idon't speak for the trustees of this group,&quot; he says, &quot;but Idon't see anything wrong with them calling their group the`Community Savings Bank Association.' I think that's an areawhere serious discussion could start.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
