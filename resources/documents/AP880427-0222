Reflecting advice given by people outside the campaign, Bushwill ``make a full-fledged effort to make sure the party isunited,'' Lee Atwater, his top campaign aide, said in an interview.   Bush, the day after clinching the 1,139 convention delegatesneeded to win the nomination, said in television interviews he wasanxious to take on likely Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.   But in the next several weeks, Bush will be ``fine-tuning hismessage'' during appearances in states with remaining primaries andcaucuses, Atwater said. He would not, however, discuss specificstrategy.   Several Republicans said in interviews they believe Bush ranaway with the nomination by exploiting longstanding commitmentsfrom GOP officials and officeholders. But they also said the timehas come for Bush to spell out his views more clearly.   ``The biggest mistake the Republican Party and its candidatescan do is to go out and say, `Look what we've done these past eightyears,'' said party Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf. ``Votersappropriately have short memories. He must not only build on therecord of the past eight years, but talk about the future.''   Fahrenkopf also said he hopes that Bush will talk about ``someof the issues that have not gotten as much attention'' as foreignpolicy, defense and economics.   He suggested that Bush should work to broaden his appeal towomen voters. While the Republican Party has stood for protectingfamily values, Fahrenkopf said, ``that doesn't mean that theRepublican Party and George Bush are not going to have to take alook at things like child care.''   Bush, in a television interview on Cable News Network, said hewill debate his opponent during the general election campaign.   ``I think any candidate, any nominee of his party, should havethe right to negotiate for when the debates should be, who shouldsponsor them, and all of that, but I will have debates and I lookforward to it,'' he said.   Bush is going to have to win over suspicious conservatives whileworking to attract such traditionally Democratic and independentvoters as blue-collar workers and ethnics who voted for Reagan,some analysts said.   ``I think he has a problem,'' said GOP consultant JohnDeardourff. ``In a certain sense he is not the master of his owndestiny. A captive candidate. He cannot run away from any aspect ofthe Reagan-Bush record. He may be very uncomfortable bearing thatburden.''   ``He's not in a position to say, `I think the president waswrong to keep offering (Attorney General) Ed Meese little shades ofcomfort here and there,''' Deardourff said.   ``Even if that weren't the case, he is about to be the nomineeof a bunch of delegates who are very conservative people. There'slittle room for leeway there.''   Fahrenkopf, however, said he does not worry about Bush'sflexibility being limited by a party platform drafted at least inpart by hard-core conservatives.   ``I don't look for any battles on the platform,'' he said,noting that Bush supported the 1980 platform. ``I think there willbe strong support among conservatives for the vice president.''   Mitchell Daniels, a former Reagan political adviser, said thatBush succeeded in winning the nomination by using an ``error-free,risk-free strategy, which I think was a very wise approach for avice president.''   But Daniels also said he felt that tactic would be ``a veryhazardous approach in the fall election campaign.''   Bush, in brief network television interviews Wednesday,acknowledged that he wants to improve his appeal to blacks, otherminorities and ethnic groups.   He noted that the Democratic Party has won most blacks' votesfor decades, but he said that could change if Jesse Jackson'ssupporters don't like the way he is treated as the campaign playsout.   ``If he's not treated fairly, a lot of people are going to beopen-minded and if I campaign properly with the way I feel in myheart about openness and inclusion, we might surprise peoplethere,'' he said.   Republican consultant Eddie Mahe Jr. said he thought talk ofBush's need to broaden his appeal to groups outside the party hasbeen exaggerated.   ``To the extent that broadening the base means moving to theleft, I don't think he has to do that,'' Mahe said. ``I thinkGeorge Bush's bigger problem is to persuade (critics) that hissense of the world and the globe is very much the same as RonaldReagan's.''</TEXT></DOC>
