Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the primary Senatesponsor of the bill. ``It is time to chart another course.''   The bill, similar to one pending on the House calendar, wouldforce U.S. businesses to divest their holdings in South Africawithin a year and would ban most trade with and lending to thatcountry.   Other supporters included Sens. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn., AlanCranston, D-Calif., Paul Simon, D-Ill., Carl Levin and DonaldRiegle, both D-Mich., Bill Bradley and Frank Lautenberg, bothD-N.J., and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.   ``This will end once and for all time American complicity in,and support for, apartheid,'' Kennedy said in announcing the billat a news conference.   While supporters of the sanctions are optimistic about Housepassage, the bill's fate in the Senate is unclear, in part becausemoderate Republicans who were key to the passage of limitedsanctions in 1986 are reluctant to go along with harsher measures.   The Reagan administration opposes the sanctions and apresidential veto is likely if Congress should pass the bill.Efforts are under way in the House to enlist the two-thirds supportthat would be needed to override a veto, but that effort would bemore difficult in the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
