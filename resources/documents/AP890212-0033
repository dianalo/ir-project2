The report, prepared at the request of Rep. Don Edwards,D-Calif., was made public Sunday. Edwards is planning to holdhearings in March by his House Judiciary subcommittee on FBI plansto update its crime computer.   Edwards praised the computer organization's report and said the``FBI should drop the tracking proposals.''   ``They pose too many problems in terms of security, privacy andaccuracy, and it seems that the tracking proposals won't be veryuseful to law enforcement anyhow,'' Edwards said in a statement.   The tracking plan is part of larger blueprints to modernize theFBI's National Crime Information Center, or NCIC.   Established in 1967, the NCIC has long been a focus ofcontroversy involving issues of individual privacy. It consists of amain computer at FBI headquarters plus an array oftelecommunications lines and a network of state and federal criminalinformation systems.   Through this system, data is exchanged by more than 64,000 state,local and federal law enforcement agencies. It contains some 20million records of wanted or missing persons, stolen property andcriminal histories.   According to the report, the NCIC system answers 750,000inquiries a day and works almost instantaneously. Some policecruising in squad cars are able to query the computer through mobileterminals, the report said.   It said the tracking proposals were part of an ``NCIC 2000''blueprint for updating the system, prepared for the FBI undercontract by the MITRE Corp.   Under this plan, the FBI would track individuals not subject toan arrest warrant but under investigation. If, for example, such asuspect arrived in New York from abroad, the system would benotified when he passed through Customs.   The system itself would notify the law enforcement agencyinvestigating the suspect. And if, on leaving New York, he drovesouth on the New Jersey Turnpike and received a ticket for speeding,the process would be repeated.   ``The NCIC is a valuable law enforcement tool,'' Edwards said.``We should focus on making it better and more accurate but itshould be limited to public record information, like warrants andstolen car reports.   He said the agency should ``go slow in expanding the NCIC,''adding that ``the experts who wrote this report found that the FBIstill has not addressed the accuracy and reliability problems'' thatcritics say exist in the system.   The study was prepared by three computer scientists, David D.Redell, Peter G. Neumann and James J. Horning, along with DianaGordon, a professor of political science at City College of NewYork, and Janlori Goldman, an attorney with the American CivilLiberties Union's privacy and technology project.</TEXT></DOC>
