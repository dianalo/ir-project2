Marr and was describedas a distinct subspecies by Tinkle and Conant in 1961. This subspeciesis relatively small for <T3>Nerodia; </T3>adults rarely exceed 900 millimeters (3 feet) total length.There are 21-23 dorsal scale rows, four rows of dark brown blotches arrangedin alternate fashion on the grayish dorsal surface, and distinct to obscuredark spots along either side of the pink to orange venter (Wright and Wright1957).    Adult Concho water snakes live in either shallow or deep water over a varietyof substrates, as long as there is sufficient deep, secure shelter frompredators near nursery grounds. Adults also use woody vegetation alongthe banks for basking. Juvenile Concho water snakes, however, have muchmore rigid habitat requirements, the two most important features of whichare shallow water with a rocky substrate and medium to large flat rockson the shore that provide hiding places (Scott and Fitzgerald 1985).   Historically, the Concho water snake occurred over about 330 miles of theConcho and Colorado Rivers and their tributaries. It is presently distributeddiscontinuously over a reduced range in Irion, Coke, Tom Green, Concho,Runnels, McCulloch, Coleman, Brown, Mills, San Saba, an Lampasas Counties(Williams 1971, Flury and Maxwell 1981. Brnovak 1975, Scott and Fitzgerald1985, Rose 1985).    On December 30, 1982, the Service published a Notice of Review of VertebrateWildlife in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(47 FR 58454). <T3>Nerodia harteri </T3>was included in category 1 of that notice. Category1 includes those taxa for which the Service has substantial informationon hand to support the biological appropriateness of a proposal to listthe species as endangered or threatened.    On February 14, 1984, the New Mexico Herpetological Society petitionedthe Service to list <T3>Nerodia harteri </T3>(including both subspecies) as threatened anddesignate its critical habitat. The Service found that substantial informationhad been presented indicating that the petitioned action might be warranted.A notice of this finding was published on May 18, 1984 (49 FR 21089). A1-year finding was reported on July 18, 1985 (50 FR 29238). That findingheld that the petitioned action was warranted for the Concho water snakebut that such action was precluded by work on other pending proposals,in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. The 1-year findingfor the remaining subspecies, the Brazos water snake, was reported concurrentlyand held that the petitioned action was not warranted for that subspecies.A proposed rule to list the Concho water snake and designate critical habitatwas published on January 22, 1986 (51 FR 2923). The final rule listingthe Concho water snake as a threatened species was published on September3, 1986 (51 FR 31412). In accordance with section 4(b)(6)(C) of the Act,the proposed critical habitat designation was not made final at the timeof listing, but was postponed for an additional year from the January 22,1987, 1-year deadline to allow for gathering and analyzing of economicdata.        <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the January 22, 1986, proposed rule and associated notifications, allinterested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. The originalcomment period closed on March 24, 1986, but was reopened on April 3, 1986(51 FR 9081), to accommodate a public hearing and remained open until May2, 1986. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies,scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted andrequested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting general public commentwas published in the San Angelo, Texas, <T3>Standard-Times</T3> on February 10, 1986. One hundred fifty-seven commentletters were received, and are discussed below. Two requests for a publichearing were received, and a hearing was held in Ballinger, Texas, on April3, 1986. Interested parties were contacted and notified of that hearing,and notices of the hearing were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 17, 1986; the Abilene, Texas, <T3>Reporter-News</T3> on March 18, 1986; the Big Spring, Texas, <T3>Herald</T3> on March 19, 1986; the Midland, Texas, <T3>Reporter-Telegram</T3> on March 15, 1986; and the San Angelo, Texas,<T3>Standard-Times</T3> on March 20, 1986. Comments received in the hearingare also summarized below.The public hearing held in Ballinger, Texas, was attended by about 350people. Fifty-seven oral or written statements were given, 5 is supportof the proposal, 46 questioning or in opposition, and 6 neither in supportnor opposition. A transcript of this hearing is available for inspection(see </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES</T2>). Organizations represented at the hearing included:U.S House of Representatives; Texas Governor's Office; U.S. GeologicalSurvey; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; USDA Soil Conservation Service; TexasParks and Wildlife Department; Texas Department of Highways; Texas GeneralLand Office; Texas Water Development Board; Big Country Audubon Society;Sierra Club; National Audubon Society; Cities of Midland, San Angelo, Ballinger,Coleman, Odessa, Abilene, Paint Rock, and Winters; Counties of Concho,Runnels, Coleman, and Tom Green; five State legislative districts; sixlocal and regional water boards; and several local governmental or businessorganizations.The 157 letters received were from 460 parties; several multiple-partyand petition letters were received. Of those, 88 letters from 111 partieswere in support of the proposed critical habitat, 51 letters from 322 partiesquestioned or opposed the proposal, and 18 letters from 27 parties wereneither in support nor opposition.All letters and written or oral statements received regarding criticalhabitat designation are combined in the following discussion. Commentsin the letters and statements concerning the proposed listing of the Conchowater snake have already been addressed in the final listing rule publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 3, 1986 (51 FR 31412). Commentson specific water projects (the need for each project, possible effectsof this proposal on such projects, and specific features of alternativeprojects) are addressed here only if they requested or resulted in specificchanges to the proposal or to the rule procedure on critical habitat designation.Information regarding the possible economic effects of the proposed criticalhabitat on such projects can be found in the Economic Analysis, which issummarized later in this rule. Comments received are available for inspection(see </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES</T2>).Comments of support were received from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department;Texas General Land Office; National Audubon Society; Big Country AudubonSociety; Defenders of Wildlife; Sierra Club; Texas Chapter of the WildlifeSociety; American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists; New MexicoHerpetological Society; Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles;94 private individuals or groups; and biologists from Texas Aandamp;I University,New York Zoological Society, Midland College, Angelo State University,Dallas Zoo, Central Texas College, Hardin-Simmons University, Texas Aandamp;MUniversity, and Texas Tech University.Comments questioning or in opposition to the proposal were received fromCongressman Charles Stenholm; Texas Water Development Board; Texas WaterCommission; Cities of Big Spring, Winters, Midland, San Angelo, Ballinger,Coleman, Odessa, Abilene, and Paint Rock; Counties of Brown, Concho, Runnels,and Coleman; six state legislators; Upper Colorado River Authority; ColoradoRiver Municipal Water District; San Angelo Water Advisory Board; CentralColorado River Authority; West Central Texas Municipal Water District;and 324 private individuals or groups. Economic information or neutral letters were received from the Bureauof Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, Environmental Protection Agency,Federal Highway Administration, Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Army Corpsof Engineers, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Texas Governor's Office,Texas System of Natural Laboratories, and 3 private individuals.Summaries of all substantive comments addressing the issue of criticalhabitat designation for the Concho water snake are covered in the followingdiscussion. Comments of similar content are grouped in a number of generalissues with the Service's response to those issues and comments.<T3>Issue 1:</T3> The sufficiency of the size of the critical habitat wasquestioned by two commenters. The Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Clubstated that they do not believe the proposed critical habitat goes farenough in securing all Concho water snake habitat and ensuring that areasare protected for reintroduction or population supplementation. They requestedthat the entire 199 miles of occupied range known at the time of proposalbe included in the critical habitat designation, and that other areas beidentified in the designation for reintoduction sites. Dr. John Peslak,of Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, questioned whether theproposed critical habitat is ``sufficient to insure the survivial of thesnake even if the Stacy Dam becomes a reality?''<T3>Service Response:</T3> The critical habitat designated in this ruleincludes all known occupied Concho water snake habitat that contains thoseconstituent elements that are essential to the conservation of the speciesand that may require special management considerations or protection. Streamand reservoir banks that are essential for the conservation of the speciesare included. The Service will continue to evaluate other areas for futureinclusion in the critical habitat.<T3>Issue 2: </T3>Three commenters requested removal of, or questionedthe need for, various areas of the proposed critical habitat. Both theTexas Water Development Board and the Texas Water Commission requestedthat the Stacy Reservoir area be excluded from the critical habitat designationfor economic reasons. Section 4(b)(2) of the Endangered Species Act providesthat the Secretary of the Interior may exclude any area from critical habitatif he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefitsof specifying such area as critical habitat, unless failure to designatesuch area as critical habitat would result in the extinction of the species.The two agencies believe that the economic benefits of the water supplyto be provided by the construction of Stacy Reservoir outweigh the benefitsof the critical habitat designation.<T3>Service Response: </T3>The reservoir basin is not withdrawn from thecritical habitat designation. Concho water snake populations were foundat Lake Spence and Lake Moonen in both 1987 and 1988 (Thornton and Dixon1988). With this information on occurrence of Concho water snakes in reservoirs,and from a survey of the potential Concho water snake habitat on the futureStacy Reservoir shoreline, the recognized potential for the snake to inhabitStacy Reservoir is substantially greater than when the designation of criticalhabitat was proposed. The retention of the critical habitat designationfor the reservoir basin is necessary to provide protection for the potentialhabitat sites within the reservoir basin. In light of the Service's biologicalopinion that the Stacy project is not likely to jeopardize the continuedexistence of the Concho water snake or to result in the destruction oradverse modification of the proposed critical habitat, no disruption tothe construction or operation of Stacy Dam and Reservoir is expected. Anyimpacts from the designation would be limited to possible restrictionson land use along those shoreline areas surrounding the reservoir thatare potential or occupied Concho water snake habitat. Therefore, the benefitsof retaining these areas in the critical habitat outweigh the benefitsof excluding them. A private landowner on the Concho River inquired about the basis for the15 vertical foot provision in the proposed critical habitat designation.This commenter pointed out that the provision would result in extensionof the critical habitat 1\1/2\ miles up Concho Creek, and states that althoughhe has observed the Concho water snake many times, he has never found onemore than 10 feet from the edge of the water. <T3>Service Response: </T3>The basis of the 15 foot elevation line is theaverage general depth of the incision of the river into the surroundingcountryside. The 15 feet is not a measurement along the surface of theground, but is instead a horizontal line rising 15 feet above the watersurface at median discharge. The distance from the water's edge to thepoint at which that line intersects the bank will depend upon the flowat the specific point in time, as well as the degree of slope of the channelbanks. The importance of these riparian areas is the maintenace of streambank integrity, which is important for preservation of actual water snakehabitat. The Service acknowledges that there is no benefit to the snakefrom extension of the critical habitat more than \1/2\ mile upstream intomost tributary streams. The Concho water snake generally does not use tributarystreams, particularly those that have only ephemeral flow. Therefore, thecritical habitat has been modified in this rule to limit the extensionof the critical habitat to \1/2\ mile upstream into any tributary of theConcho and Colorado Rivers or to Stacy Reservoir at the conservation poollevel. <T3>Issue 3. </T3>Three commenters questioned the process for economicanalysis of the critical habitat, or asked for specific considerationsin that process. The Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club asked that economicsnot be considered in the critical habitat designation. <T3>Service Response: </T3>The Endangered Species Act (section 4(b)(2))specifies that the ``economic impact, and any other relevant impact'' beconsidered in the final designation of critical habitat. In addition, criticalhabitat designation is also subject to Executive Order 12291, which requires,to the extent permitted by law, that all regulatory actions will have benefitsoutweighing costs, and that the alternative with the largest net benefitshall be chosen; to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which requires analysisof the impacts of regulatory actions on small entities; and, to the PaperworkReduction Act, the purpose of which is to minimize the paperwork and resultingcosts of regulatory actions. Only the listing portion of the proposed rulewas exempt from economic considerations. The Texas Water Development Board objected to the delay in completing aneconomic analysis of the critical habitat. The Board pointed out that inJuly 1983 they notified the Service of potential conflicts between waterdevelopment and the proposed critical habitat and recommended that a comprehensiveeconomic analysis be conducted. They questioned why no analysis had yetbeen done at the time of the publication of the proposed rule on listingand critical habitat in January 1986.<T3>Service Response: </T3>When critical habitat designation is proposedconcurrently with the listing of a species, as is required (with certainexceptions) by the Act, the economic analysis is not conducted prior toproposal to avoid non-biological considerations from influencing or delayingthe listing. This procedure is based upon the specific requirement of theAct that listing actions be based on the best biological and commercialdata available. The Big Country Audubon Society requested that the Service's economic analysisfocus on patterns of water use in the area. <T3>Service Response: </T3>As a result of the reasonable and prudent alternativesdeveloped for the Stacy Reservoir, there are no known conflicts betweenthe critical habitat designation and any specific water development inthe area. Therefore, the economic analysis addresses water use patternsonly to the extent that the Stacy biological opinion results in economiccosts for such use patterns. Compensation costs that must be paid by the Colorado River Municipal WaterDistrict for construction of Stacy Reservoir include hiring of a biologistto oversee all phases of construction, funding studies on Concho watersnake life history, genetics, and habitat requirements, and constructionof riffle habitats in the river. However, these costs are part of the reasonableand prudent alternatives needed to relieve jeopardy to the Concho watersnake and would be required even if no critical habitat were proposed.<T3>Issue 4: </T3>One commenter presented several questions regarding theimpacts of critical habitat designation on private property fronting onthe critical habitat. He specifically questioned if the critical habitatdesignation would affect his water rights or his ability to control brushalong the river and draws. He states that landowners will suffer economicallyfrom the critical habitat designation through loss of control and fulluse of their property and water rights. <T3>Service Response: </T3>The land and water rights of private landownersare in no way affected or limited by the designation of critical habitat.Critical habitat provides protection only from Federal actions. It doesnot affect private actions, lands, water or any other rights, unless theprivate actions are Federally funded or if they require a Federal permit.Brush control by a private individual on private lands would not be affectedunless Federal money is being used in the project. Private water rightswould not be affected per se. However, if the mechanism used to developthe water right involves actions in the river channel that require a permitunder the Clean Water Act, the Rivers and Harbors Act, or other such Federallegislation, then the proposed permit for the mechanism would be subjectto consultation with the Service under section 7 of the Endangered SpeciesAct. The effect, if any, of the consultation on the mechanism for implementingthe water right would vary depending on the location and type of action.Such effects are generally minor and may involve some modifications tothe project to accommodate the species and/or its critical habitat. <T3>Issue 5: </T3>Several commenters suggested actions that they thinkshould be taken instead of critical habitat designation, or as a necessaryadjunct to the designation. The Texas General Land Office, Natural HeritageProgram, believes that assurances of adequate stream flows for reproductionand growth of the Concho water snake should be included in the criticalhabitat designation.<T3>Service Response: </T3>Minimum stream flows and flood or channel maintenanceflows are provided for most of the critical habitat as a part of the reasonableand prudent alternatives set forth in the Service's biological opinionresulting from the consultation on Stacy Reservoir. These flow requirementsare included in the constituent elements for the designated critical habitatat the end of this rule. The Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club requested that the Service seekeasement, water rights, or fee title to riparian areas critical to theConcho water snake. <T3>Service Response: </T3>At present none of these measures appear tobe necessary to the continued survival and recovery of the Concho watersnake. As the implementation of the reasonable and prudent alternativesof the Section 7 consultation on Stacy Reservoir proceeds, areas may beidentified for which easement or full-title acquisition may be desirable.A private landowner questioned whether critical habitat will do anythingto enhance the Concho water snake as long as nothing is done to eliminatenatural predators. <T3>Service Response: </T3>Although fish may prey upon young Concho watersnakes, there are no data that suggest fish or predation in general, havebeen a major factor in the overall decline of the Concho water snake. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Critical habitat, as defined by section 3 of the Act means: (i) The specificareas within the geographical area occupied by a species, at the time itis listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those physicalor biological features (I) essential to the conservation of the speciesand (II) that may require special management considerations or protection,and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the speciesat the time it is listed, upon a determination that such areas are essentialfor the conservation of the species.The future Stacy Reservoir basin will be included in the final designationof critical habitat. With recent information on occurrence of Concho watersnakes at Spence and Moonen reservoirs, and from a survey of the potentialwater snake habitat on the future Stacy Reservoir shoreline, the potentialfor the snake to inhabit Stacy Reservoir appears significantly greaterthan previously thought. About 63 km of the future lake shoreline betweenelevations 1,530 feet and 1,551.5 feet (conservation pool level) were foundto contain rocky habitat similar to that found in Spence and Moonen reservoirs.This is 26 and 33 percent of the shoreline at the two elevations, respectively.Open spaces between rocky habitat areas are less than 800 meters, whichwould allow at least some movement of snakes between sites.Because of the uncertain time factor and other variables, the Service doesnot believe that future reservoir habitat will be equal to the amount ofstream habitat lost to impoundment. However, the Service believes thatsuccessful occupation of a number of sites around Stacy Reservoir by theConcho water snake would significantly reduce the fragmentation effectby providing a corridor for gene flow through snake movement. Translocationof snakes above and below the Dam may be necessary to augment natural movementsif they are found to be insufficient.In addition, the March 7, 1989 amendment to the biological opinion providesthat the 17 segments of future Stacy Reservoir shoreline identified inthe 1988 Annual Report (Thorton and Dixon 1988) and maps as potential Conchowater snake habitat are to be protected by the Colorado River MunicipalWater District from development for housing, industry, agriculture, recreationor other activities that could have an adverse effect on snake habitat.The areas that are included in the critical habitat designation containessential elements for the conservation of the Concho water snake. Theseinclude: riffles for feeding and resting, rocky gravel bars that provideshelter for neonates, larger rocks that adults and subadults use for baskingor for shelter, brush/debris piles adjacent to riffles for shelter, lowtree limbs overhanging the river for basking (usually adjacent to riffles),minimum stream flows (see item 4 of amendment to 50 CFR 17.95(c) at endof this rule), and rocky areas and stream pool banks for movement to otherareas (Dixon, Greene, and Mueller 1988; Thorton and Dixon 1988).The Concho water snake is protected from taking and harm by section 9 ofthe Act, and is protected against adverse impacts to the snake itself fromFederal actions. Critical habitat designation provides that additionalprotection of that habitat from adverse impacts of Federal actions. Thishabitat protection is consistent with the habitat protection needs outlinedin the biological opinion, as amended, on Stacy Dam. These needs includeprotection of approximately 17 segments of reservoir shoreline habitat,restoration of riffle habitats, stream and habitat monitoring, and maintenanceof minimum flows.Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that critical habitat be designatedto the maximum extent prudent and determinable concurrently with the determinationthat a species is endangered or threatened. Section 4(b)(6) requires thata proposed listing be made final within one year from the publication ofthe proposal, but provides for an additional one-year extension for thefinal designation of critical habitat, if necessary. Critical habitat isbeing designated for the Concho water snake (<T3>Nerodia harteri paucimaculata</T3>) in the following areas:1. Concho River in Tom Green and Concho Counties, Texas. A stretch extendingfrom Mullin's Crossing located 5 miles northeast of the town of Veribest,downstream to the confluence of the Concho and Colorado Rivers.2. Colorado River in Runnels, Concho, Coleman, and McCulloch Counties,Texas. A stretch extending from the Farm to Market Road 3115 bridge nearthe town of Maverick downstream to the confluence of the Colorado Riverand Salt Creek, northeast of the town of Doole.Both stretches include both the river channel and the river banks up to15 vertical feet above the water level at median discharge. However, thecritical habitat is limited to no more than \1/2\ mile upstream on anytributaries of either the Concho or Colorado Rivers. The Service will continueto evaluate other areas for future designation as critical habitat.3. The entire future Stacy Reservoir basin up to the maximum water levelof 1551.5 foot elevation, and including reservoir banks up to 15 verticalfeet above the 1551.5 foot elevation.   This critical habitat designation has been modified from the area proposed.Critical habitat is limited to no more than \1/2\ mile upstream on anytributary of either the Concho or Colorado Rivers, and the portions ofthe Concho and Colorado Rivers that will become Stacy Reservoir have beenretained in the critical habitat designation. The dam that will createthe reservoir is currently under construction and was the subject of consultationunder section 7 of the Act. The December 19, 1986, biological opinion (asamended March 7, 1989) resulting from that consultation, set forth reasonableand prudent alternatives for creating and preserving habitat elsewhere.If implemented, those alternatives would reduce the impacts of the reservoiron proposed critical habitat to levels that would not significantly diminishthe value of the proposed critical habitat (or its constituent elements)for the survival and recovery of the Concho water snake.   The Service issued an amended biological opinion on March 7, 1989, basedon its review of new information, including the discovery of Concho watersnake populations in two reservoirs. Concho water snakes are expected tocolonize the Stacy Reservoir. Therefore, certain requirements in the originalbiological opinion have been reduced or eliminated. The eliminated requirementsinclude construction of artificial habitats in the reservoir basin, andconstruction of low head dams, gabions, and aritificial riffle habitatson the lower Colorado River from Winchell to a point about 33 miles downstream.Monitoring of stream and stream habitat has also been reduced. Riffle habitatsare to be restored in the upper Colorado River. Construction of other lowhead dams, gabions, and artificial riffles on the lower Colorado Riverfrom a point about 33 miles below Winchell downstream about 16 miles toPecan Bayou has been delayed pending evaluation of prototype structuresin the upper Colorado River and changes in the lower Colorado River. Theapproximately seventeen segments of reservoir shoreline habitat that wereidentified in the 1988 Annual Report (Thornton and Dixon 1988) must beprotected from adverse impacts.   The entire Stacy Reservoir basin has been included in designation of criticalhabitat because this area is expected to contribute to viable Concho watersnake populations. This is a change from the proposed critical habitatbecause it include all areas that will be inundated following constructionof Stacy Dam.   In addition, the proposed critical habitat has been modified to limit designationof critical habitat to the lower \1/2\ mile of streams tributary to theConcho and Colorado Rivers or to Stacy Reservoir at the conservation poollevel. The proposed critical habitat included land areas inside of a horizonalline drawn outward from a point 15 vertical feet above the level of mediandischarge of the river. It was pointed out during the comment period thatbecause of the low topographic relief of the area, this provison allowedthe proposed critical habitat to extend upstream into some tributariesfor 1 to 2 miles. However, only the mouths of these tributaries and theirbanks are considered to be critical to the species' survival. Therefore,the extension of the critical habitat up the tributary streams has beenlimited to \1/2\ mile.   The constituent elements of the final critical habitat are biologicallyimportant to the survival of viable Concho water snake populations. Streamand reservoir bank integrity must be maintained to provide areas for thewater snakes to rest, bask, and travel between sites. Riffle habitats areimportant feeding and resting areas for water snakes, especially neonates.Rocky substrates of different sizes provide shelter sites for water snakesof all age groups. Minimum stream flow requirements must be met (see item4 of amendment to 50 CFR 17.95(c) at end of this rule). Water quality maintenancecontributes to an ample prey base. The stretches of river and the reservoirbasin in this critical habitat designation contain the constituent elementsthat are necessary for Concho water snake survival.   Section 4(b)(8) requires, for any proposed or final regulation that designatescritical habitat, a brief description and evaluation of those activities(public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may be affectedby such designation. Any activity that would lessen the amount of minimumflow, or would significantly alter the natural flow regime in those portionsof the Concho and Colorado Rivers, could adversely impact the criticalhabitat. Such activities include, but are not limited to, impoundment andwater diversion. Any activity that would extensively alter the channeland bank morphology in those river portions and result in a significantdecrease in the amount or quality of riffle habitat could adversely impactthe critical habitat. Such activities include, but are not limited to,channelization, excessive sedimentation, mining or rock and gravel, pollution,impoundment, and removal of riparian vegetation. Any activity that wouldsignificantly alter the water chemistry or temperature regime in thoseriver portions could adversely impact the critical habitat. Such activitiesinclude, but are not limited to, release of chemical or biological pollutantsinto the waters at a point source or by dispersed release.             Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic andother impacts of designating a particular area as critical habitat. TheService has considered the critical habitat designation in light of alladditional relevant information obtained during the public comment periodand public hearings. An Economic Analysis and Determination of Effectsof Rules for the critical habitat designation have been prepared and areavailable upon request. No significant economic or other impacts are expectedfrom this designation of critical habitat for the Concho water snake. Theadditional information received has been addressed in the ``Summary ofComments'' section of this rule or in the economic documents prepared onthe rule. Conclusions of the economic assessments are summarized in the``Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12291'' section of thisrule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Section 7(a)(2) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is listed as endangeredor threatened and with respect to the habitat that has been designatedas critical. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provisionof the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federalagencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out arenot likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species orto destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect the listed species or its critical habitat, the responsibleFederal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.Concho water snakes are found only in rivers, reservoirs and their shorelines,and adjacent riparian areas on private, State, or county owned lands. Thiscritical habitat designation is expected to have little effect upon thepresent land and water uses in the area. Known Federal activities thatmay be affected by this critical habitat designation are future federallyfunded or authorized dam and reservoir construction; highway, bridge, andpipeline construction; or irrigation projects. Such activities, althoughon private lands, would be subject to section 7 consultation if Federalfunding were involved, or if the activity requires Federal authorization.The threatened status of the Concho water snake, under provisions of section4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, is not affectedby this designation of its critical habitat.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Department of the Interior has determined that designation of criticalhabitat for this species is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291and certifies that this designation will not have a significant economiceffect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). No additional costs to Federal or non-Federal entitiescaused by critical habitat designation have been identified. The Serviceand the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) completed an informal consultationon a planned floodwater retention project. The SCS determined that theproject would have no adverse effect on the Concho water snake or its criticalhabitat, and the Service concurred with this conclusion. The above findingsare based on opinions rendered by the agencies involved, and on the following:Bureau of Reclamation's normal and expected management of water releasesfrom upstream reservoirs; the expectation that no additional economic impactswill accrue to Stacy Dam and Reservoir as a result of the designation ofcritical habitat; the absence of other ongoing or planned Corps of Engineersor Federal Emergency Management Agency projects in the vicinity of thecritical habitat; the expectation of either no impacts or beneficial impactsfrom existing and partially completed SCS projects in the vicinity of thecritical habitat; the existence of easily added protective mechanisms thatcan be used to protect against adverse modification of critical habitatby the All-American pipeline; current Environmental Protection Agency standardson National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits in the riverbasin; and Federal Highway Administration policies for avoiding adverseenvironmental effects. In addition, no State or private activities involvingFederal funds or permits are expected to affect or be affected by the criticalhabitat designation.Therefore, no significant economic impacts are expected to result fromthe critical habitat designation. In addition, no direct costs, enforcementcosts, or information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposedon small entities by the designation. These determinations are based ona Determination of Effects of Rules that is available upon request (see<T2>ADDRESSES</T2>).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Brnovak, G.T. 1975.
