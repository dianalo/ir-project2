They said a 12-year-old boy and his mother, members of a civilianfamily, were taken to a hospital and treated for shock. No otherinjuries were reported.   The outlawed Irish Republican Army telephoned a 20-minute warningabout the bomb on a housing project in the city's Watersidedistrict, but it exploded after 15 minutes, police said.   It was the fourth attack on British army homes in the province inthe past month.   The IRA, fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland andunite it with the Irish Republic, on Friday issued a one-weekdeadline for the wives and children of British soldiers to get outof what it called the ``war zone'' and return to the Britishmainland.   Some 10,500 British troops are currently deployed in NorthernIreland. Unofficial estimates say between 1,500 and 2,000 soldiershave their families with them.   Since the IRA intensified attacks on British servicemen in March,44 soldiers have been killed, including four at British bases incontinental Europe and one at a base in London.</TEXT></DOC>
