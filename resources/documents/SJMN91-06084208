I hadphoned to ask the Wizard of Westwood about the NCAA tournament. But ourconversation of March Madness was overshadowed by March Sadness.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MARCH SADNESSFINAL FOUR MAKES WOODEN GRIEVE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     For one thing, Wooden's arthritis is putting on a swarming full-court pressthese days. It took him five rings to get to the phone. He can no longer takehis daily walks. Instead, he's in physical therapy four times a week.;    &quot;Mywalking is out, I'm afraid,&quot; he said forlornly. &quot;But I've got so I can getalong with a cane.&quot;;    For a while he needed a walker. His left knee and hipache constantly. The right side is in bad shape. He gets a shot -- &quot;somethingstronger than cortisone&quot; -- every month for his left hip. It helps a little,but not enough.;    Wooden probably needs a new hip. The problem is his rightknee is so bad it wouldn't allow him to do the required therapy following ahip-replacement operation. And vice versa.;    &quot;It's got them kind ofpuzzled,&quot; Wooden said.;    He misses his morning walks, but what pains Woodenmore is his 5-year-old great-granddaughter, Cori. She's the oldest of fivegreat-grandchildren, a cute little blond button who first helped pull him outof a deep depression after Nell, his wife of 52 years, passed away.;    Thatwas six years ago. Wooden took &quot;the only sweetheart I ever had&quot; to thehospital on Christmas morning and she never left. She died on the first day ofspring, March 21.;    For a while, Wooden admits, he was waiting for life'sfinal buzzer. Consumed by grief, he didn't know what the use was of going onwithout his sweetheart.;    'A reason for living';  His zest came back withthe birth of Cori, and then the four great-grandchildren who followed. &quot;Theywere really a reason for living,&quot; said Wooden.;    But now Cori has been dealta bad break and it makes her great-grandfather, &quot;Papa&quot; as she calls Wooden,sad. Makes his heart ache as though it, too, has arthritis.;    &quot;Little Coriwas terribly sick awhile back,&quot; Wooden says. &quot;We just found out she has juniordiabetes.&quot;;    Little Cori was in the hospital for a week and then a few moredays after a second attack. She's home now and doing much better, but she'llprobably have to take insulin shots twice daily for the rest of her life.Right now she also has to give blood samples four times a day for tests. It'sa crummy lot for a 5-year-old.;    The NCAA tournament also makes Coach alittle sad, if sad is the right word. He has so many wonderful March Madnessmemories, but Nell is in each and every one of them. They went to 36 FinalFours in a row together until she fell ill.;    Wooden hasn't been back to aFinal Four since. He can't go back. It's too painful, much more so than thearthritis or even the junior diabetes. Nell, not basketball, was his truelove.;    Maybe, maybe not;  &quot;I never went to a Final Four without her,&quot; heexplains. &quot;It just wouldn't be the same.&quot;;    Maybe this year he will go.Maybe. But probably not.;    You see, the 1991 Final Four will be played inIndiana, in the Hoosier Dome, just a short drive away from Centerton, Ind.,where John Robert Wooden was born 80 years ago.;    They're even throwing aspecial affair for the most famous Hoosier of all, for John Wooden, the onlyperson enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player (1960) and asa coach (1972). They're flying back his daughter, son, two brothers, all oftheir spouses and some of his former players, from UCLA, Indiana State andeven his high school teams.;    &quot;It's the same time as the Final Four so I cango to the Final Four if I want to,&quot; Wooden says. &quot;But I doubt very much ifI'll go.;    Other priorities;  &quot;There are other things I want to do. I wantto visit my hometown. I want to spend Easter Sunday at the church where mywife and I were baptized.;    &quot;I want to visit the cemetery where my motherand father and two sisters are buried, and the cemetery where my wife'sparents are put away.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  WOODY WOODBURN, Scripps Howard News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910324  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  745  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday March 24, 199100084208,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
