Answer: The U.S.andP;  Naval AcademyData Network (NADN), a complex communications system integrated by TRW Inc.'sInformation Networks Division (IND).andP;  In 1986, the Naval Academy, Annapolis,MD, solicited bids for a network that would link all its midshipmen toexisting and oncoming computer systems.andP;  Four companies-including IBMCorp.-bid on the project.andM;TRW won the contract in the summer of 1988 and began work that September.andO;Work on the two main buildings was essentially completed in the summer of1989.andP;  TRW is still refining the network, hooking up additional buildings andproviding maintenance services.andP;  Total cost: approximately $8 million.andM;The Naval Academy has not yet formally accepted the NADN, pending completionof the project.andP;  Formal acceptance, should it occur, will probably not comeuntil the first quarter of next year, according to a Navy spokesman.andP;  Thatbeing the case, the Naval Academy declined to talk about the integrationproject.andM;Contract requirements called for TRW to design and install the entirenetwork, as well as provide maintenance for three years after the project'scompletion.andM;Before TRW stepped in, the Naval Academy had 15 host computers, including aDigital Equipment Corp. VAX-11/780, VAX 8350 and VAX 8600; a Gould Inc.andO;PowerNode 9050; a Honeywell Inc. DPS 8/62; and some Sun Microsystems Inc.andO;Sun-3/280s.andM;To complicate the situation, the network mix was equally disparate andincompatible.andP;  Besides an X.25 packet-switching wide area network (WAN), theAcademy's campus had personal computer (PC) local area networks (LANs) fromIBM, Apple Computer Inc., Proteon Inc. and 3Com Corp. The campus had aUnix-based network from Sun and a DECnet LAN from Digital.andM;The Naval Academy wanted to connect all campus computers, includingprofessors' computers, to existing networks-and make them available to the4,600 midshipmen.andP;  The Naval Academy has approximately 2,000 faculty membersand administrators.andP;  All midshipmen had DOS-based Zenith Data Systems PCs,which they were required to buy.andP;  A few midshipmen also had AppleMacintoshes.andM;DDN dictates protocolandM;Enter TRW and the NADN.andP;  Operating without major partners, TRW's first goalwas to choose an overall connectivity scheme.andP;  Sticking with standards, TRWopted for an IEEE 802.3 compliant Ethernet network running transmissioncontrol protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP)) over fiber-optic cable andbroadband coaxial cable.andP;  The fiber-optic cables come from Siecor Corp.; thebroadband coaxial cables come from different vendors.andM;&quot;The reason for using TCP/IP,&quot; explains TRW's Jim Snee, a senior systemsengineer formerly on the NADN project, &quot;was for compatibility with theworldwide network (Defense Data Network-DDN), which runs TCP/IP.&quot; TRW hadconsidered Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocols.andP;  Snee says, &quot;At thetime of the proposal, OSI was purely blue sky.&quot;andM;The Naval Academy's original contract called for six-wire, twisted-paircabling.andP;  But TRW decided on eight-wire cables because of these advantagesover six-wire cables:andM;*  Relatively easy addition of new capabilities (e.g.andP;  voice) into thesystem-one of the Academy's eventual goals;andM;*  Expandability without requiring new cable installation;andM;*  Flexibility in going easily from RS232 serial connections to Ethernet.andM;Snee comments, &quot;Today, a classroom might need only serial ports.andP;  Tomorrow,it may be an office with a minicomputer that requires Ethernet.andP;  Eight-wiregives the flexibility of switching back and forth between RS232 serial andEthernet.&quot;andM;Not having to install new cables to upgrade the network is an importantadvantage because cable installation was already extremely difficult.andP;  Why?andO;Because many of the buildings are in the National Historic Register and couldnot be damaged or significantly altered.andP;  TRW's solution was to run thecables with existing telephone cables.andM;Using existing telephone conduits didn't solve all the problems.andP;  &quot;Thetoughest problem was punching a hole through three feet of granite,&quot; explainsSnee, referring to the exterior wall of the dormitory.andP;  &quot;Just getting throughthe granite is tough enough but to do it over four inches [in diameter] wasthe real problem.&quot;andM;The solution? &quot;Extreme pain,&quot; Snee reports, &quot;it took special drillingequipment and extensive labor.&quot;andM;&quot;Anchors aweigh!&quot;andM;Currently, the NADN connects 57 host computers (15 pre-existing, 42 new), 42campus buildings, more than 10,000 communications ports and 6,600 users,according to Joseph Aro, marketing manager at TRW IND.andM;The main communications medium is a 10M-bits-per-second (bps) fiber optic andvideo backbone that can be upgraded to 100M bps.andP;  Actually, the NADNcomprises 10 separate Ethernet paths, or rings, each running at 10M bps.andP;  Twoof the rings are based on coaxial, eight on fiber-optic cable.andM;The backbone is currently not fiber distributed data interface(FDDI)-compliant, but it can be field-upgraded-a job that requires justreplacing the modems.andP;  TRW has no plans to upgrade to FDDI within the life ofits contract.andM;Backbone's connected to the ...andM;The NADN configuration-which includes existing heterogeneousnetworks-requires a lot of routers, bridges, concentrators, network servers,gateways and terminal servers.andP;  TRW chose &quot;routers-bridges&quot; from WellfleetCommunications Inc.andP;  Routers-bridges, sometimes referred to as  brouters,&quot;combine the functions of routers and bridges in one box.)andM;Wellfleet's  Concentrator  Nodes (CNs) can provide multiprotocol LAN-to-WANconnectivity with up to 26 LAN ports and 26 WAN ports.andP;  The Academy's versionuses 10M bps, dual-port Ethernet interface modules to link Ethernetsubnetworks.andM;For twisted-pair Ethernet concentrators, TRW turned to SynOpticsCommunications Inc. SynOptics' LattisNet concentrators connect the Academy'sbaseband subnetworks to the fiber-optic backbone.andP;  There are 10 Model 1000concentrators and about 25 Model 1010 concentrators on the NADN.andM;Acer Counterpoint Inc. supplies most of the network servers, which run Unix.andO;The NADN uses more than 50 Acer servers.andM;To go from the Ethernet NADN to the X.25 network and outside networks likeDDN, TRW opted for two multiprotocol gateways from cisco Systems Inc.andM;Gateways to the worldandM;Gateways are the primary means of linking  proprietary,  heterogeneouscomputers to the TCP/IP-Ethernet NADN.andP;  &quot;TCP/IP gateways solve the problem ofintegrating the multivendor environment into the NADN,&quot; says Snee.andP;  &quot;Gatewaysprovide the means of file transfer and communications.&quot;andM;Besides the cisco gateways, TRW used a gateway from Kinetics Inc. to hook theAppleTalk LAN into the Ethernet NADN.andP;  Kinetics was subsequently bought byNovell Inc. The products are sold under the Novell-Kinetics FastPath name.)andM;TRW designs and manufactures its own terminal servers (Advanced ConnectorUnits, or ACU2000s), which it used in the NADN network.andP;  Some ACU2000 portsare simple RS232 connections; others are 10M-bps connections.andP;  ACU2000sconnect two to 160 asynchronous terminals or computers to Ethernet-TCP/IPnetworks.andM;Off-the shelf softwareandM;Most software that the Academy uses on the NADN is commercially available,off-the-shelf packages.andP;  The only software TRW supplied was anetwork-management system, which is based on the Simple Network ManagementProtocol (SNMP)-the TCP/IP standard for network management.andM;TRW's original bid called for Quadratron Systems Inc.'s Q Office software,which runs under DOS, Unix and other-systems.andP;  Since then, Quadratron's Cliqsoftware has replaced Q Office.andP;  Cliq provides electronic mail, wordprocessing and spreadsheet functions as well as bulletin board, phonedirectory and calendar capabilities.andM;Midshipmen can electronically receive, complete and return homeworkassignments from PCs in their dorm rooms because of NADN.andP;  The midshipmen canalso access library  on and off-campus databases.andM;TRW NETWORKSandM;DIVISON PROFILEandM;he information Networks Division (IND) is one of parent company TRW Inc.'sthree-prong systems integration thrusts.andP;  The others are TRW FinancialSystems Inc. (the main commercial systems integration outfit) and the TRWSystems Integration Group (the main federal systems integrator).andM;TRW IND tagets campus-wide network integration projects, most often usingTCP/IP-over-Ethernet solutions.andP;  According to Joseph Aro, marketing managerat TRW IND, about 85 percent of the division's work is in the federal sector;15 percent is commercial.andM;Companies mentioned in this articleandM;Acer Counterpoint Inc.andM;2127 Ringwood Ave.andM;San Jose, CA 95131andM;(408) 434-0190andM;Circle 279andM;Apple Computer Inc.andM;20525 Mariani Ave.andM;Cupertino, CA 95014andM;(408) 973-3019andM;Circle 263andM;cisco Systems Inc.andM;1350 Willow RoadandM;Menlo Park, CA 94025andM;(415) 326-1941andM;Circle 264andM;Digital Equipment Corp.andM;146 Main St.andM;Maynard, MA 01754andM;(508) 897-5111andM;Circle 265andM;Gould Inc.andM;Computer Systems DivisionandM;6901 W.
