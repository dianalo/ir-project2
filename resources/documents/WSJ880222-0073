At this point in the market cycle, cattlemen and hog farmers normally would be adding to their herds with a vengeance. Last year, livestock producers earned a record $74 billion. In the past, profits of that magnitude, as well as abundant feed supplies, would have been all that was needed to entice producers into increasing herd size.    But things are far from normal. The profits of the past year and a half come on the heels of a collapse of the farm economy and a shift in consumer preferences to poultry from red meat. The result: Producers are playing cautious.    &quot;Beef demand is said to be going to pieces,&quot; says Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., a forecasting firm in Arlington Heights, Ill. &quot;Would you stake the next five to 10 years of your livelihood on something that's supposed to be going to the pits?&quot;    Indeed, in its latest population reports, the Agriculture Department found that the nation's cattle herd has shrunk for the sixth consecutive year and that hog producers increased production only 6% -- about half of what the industry had been expecting.    The news has caught many analysts offguard. It has also helped reduce the negative sentiment that has plagued cattle and hog futures markets since last fall. As of Friday's close, the February cattle futures contract was 31% above the contract's lifetime low of 55.10 cents a pound, while the hog contract for settlement this month was 21% above its low of 37.55 cents a pound.    For consumers, the reports are a signal that there is no end in sight to higher beef prices. In fact, beef prices will continue to rise as supplies continue to shrink and packers and retailers are forced to pay more for animals. Pork prices may decline a bit more, but with such a small expansion it isn't likely the prices will be as low as expected.    The reluctance to commit themselves to an expansion and the debt that comes with it indicates that producers won't soon forget the troubled 1980s. Tastes changed; last year, for the first time, poultry consumption exceeded both beef and pork consumption. Many producers were reduced to financial cripples as they tried to repay high-interest loans taken on in the last expansion phase.    And while last year was the best in 10 years for producers, it follows at least four years of red ink. Some economists aren't so sure that more years of falling profits are too far behind. Hog prices should decline to the upper $30-a-hundredweight range by next year, then drop a further $4 to $5 in 1990, according to the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute in Columbia, Mo. An increase in the beef herd would raise prices for a short time, as more animals are retained for breeding rather than sent to slaughter, but once the numbers were built up those prices would fall, too.    Producers are also well aware that their profits are largely attributable to falling feed-grain prices rather than to big demand. Since 1985, feed prices have fallen 17%. But that can only last as long as stockpiles do, and they are already beginning to decline. Cash soybean meal and corn prices have already risen 23% and 42% from year-earlier levels, and they are likely to go higher. Economists predict that this year's price increases will trim income.    &quot;The industry is being set up by artificially low feed prices,&quot; says Jon Brandt, a livestock analyst at the Food and Agricultural Policy Institute.    Given all that, few producers are willing to go back into debt. Spending now is financed internally after careful planning. &quot;We went through a time where the more money you could borrow the better off you were,&quot; says Gary Naylor, a livestock specialist for the Springfield, Mo., area. &quot;Now its a complete turnaround.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
