The detailed documentationavailable for several episodes of the 1983 to 1984 PuuOo eruption canbe used in combination with an extension of the emplacement theory forsolitary lobate flows to simulate comparable eruptions on the surfaceof Mars. For simplicity, the simulation is restricted to differencesin the gravity between earth and Mars.</TEXT></DOC>
