The allegations against the four traders in the Swissfranc pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange are a sign thefederal futures trading probe will focus on allegedwrongdoing by more than the 48 individuals who have so farbeen indicted on fraud charges at the Merc and the ChicagoBoard of Trade. The allegations came during the government'sopening argument in the first of three scheduled trials offutures traders and a clerk charged last year with stealingfrom customers.</LP><TEXT>   Exchange officials have pointed to the limited number ofindictments as evidence that wrongdoing in their markets is arelatively rare event. But the government's opening salvo inthe Swiss franc case indicates that many more exchangemembers may have the propriety of their trades questioned byprosecutors.   Sixteen Japanese yen futures traders on the Merc and 12soybean futures traders and a clerk on the Board of Tradewill stand trial in September on fraud charges in twoseparate trials. In documents previously filed relating tothe soybean futures case, the government alleged that itsundercover agent in that pit made illegal trades with &quot;scoresof unindicted co-conspirators.&quot;   The government said the Swiss franc traders on trial,Robert Mosky, Danny Scheck and David Zatz, were aided intheir alleged scheme to steal from customers by four othertraders: Gary Kost, Michael Joyce, Michael Ansani and ScottSchumer.   Prosecutors gave no indication as to whether they hadenough evidence to seek grand jury indictments against thefour traders.   Mr. Kost is an employee of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. andis a broker in the Swiss franc pit buying and selling futurescontacts for his employer and its customers. Mr. Joyce is anunaffiliated broker who handles a significant number ofShearson orders. A Shearson official said he was unaware ofthe government allegations and couldn't comment.   Mr. Kost couldn't be reached for comment. A womananswering the phone at Mr. Joyce's home referred a call tohis lawyer, Terry Grimm, who couldn't be reached for comment.   Mr. Ansani, one of the most active independent traders inthe Swiss franc futures pit, couldn't be reached for comment.Mr. Schumer also trades for his own account, and declined tocomment on the government allegations.</TEXT></DOC>
