<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-0137 </DOCNO><TEXT>Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is the major volatile reduced organic sulfur compoundin the water column of coastal Salt Pond, Cape Cod, MA. DMS concentrationand vertical distributions vary seasonally in response to changing biogeochemicalprocesses in the pond. When the pond is thermally stratified in summer,maximum DMS concentrations of up to 60 nmol/l were found in the oxygen-deficientmetalimnion. DMS concentrations in the epilimnion were always an orderof magnitude higher than in the hypolimnion. The most likely precursorfor DMS is algal dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which showed verticalprofiles similar to those of DMS. Laboratory experiments show that microorganismsin the pond, especially in the metalimnion, are capable of decomposingDMSP to DMS, while photosynthetic sulfur bacteria in the hypolimnioncan consume DMS. Estimates of DMS production and consumption in SaltPond have been made, considering production of DMS in the epilimnionand matalimnion and removal of DMS via gas exchange to the atmosphere,tidal exchange, and microbial consumption in the hypolimnion.</TEXT></DOC>
