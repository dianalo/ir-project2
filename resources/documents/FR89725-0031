Burrows, Director,National Computer Systems Laboratory (NCSL) at NIST, forwarded a requestto the Director of NIST for support from the National Voluntary LaboratoryAccreditation Program (NVLAP) by the establishment of a NVLAP program toaccredit testing laboratories that test the conformance of software productsto the Portable Operating System Interface for Computer Environments (POSIX)family of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). To quote fromthe request:``The laboratories initially will test software products for conformanceto the FIPS 151 (POSIX) using the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST) developed NIST POSIX Conformance Test Suite (NIST-PCTS). The testresults will be evaluated by the National Computer Systems Laboratory (NCSL)as a basis for issuing a certificate of conformance to the FIPS 151. FIPS151 is based on the IEEE Standard 1003.1-1988 which was developed by thatvoluntary, consensus driven, committee. It is designed for use by computingprofessionals involved in system and applications software developmentand implementation. The test assertions from which the NIST-PCTS was developedare based on the IEEE 1003.3 committee's work on test methods for measuringconformance to POSIX. The NIST-PCTS is available through the National TechnicalInformation Services (NTIS) and will be maintained by NCSL.The need for a POSIX standard is pointed out by the lack of portabilityof software between different machines and operating systems, thus causingcostly problems in upgrading hardware and software systems. POSIX providesthe functionality required to support source code portability for a widerange of applications across different environments by providing a standardinterface between applications and the operating systems. An objective,accredited third party testing program is needed to provide credibilityto vendor claims of conformance to the standard. NVLAP would provide theassurance of having qualified testing laboratories for these functions.The commercial endeavors established would yield enhancements and valueadded services to the testing process. Currently, there is no accreditedprogram for this determination of conformance. While NCSL could providethe objectivity, NCSL does not have the resources to perform this testing.''NVLAP currently offers accreditation to laboratories testing for conformanceof software to selected software standards. (See notice in <T4>Federal Register</T4> Vol. 53, No. 140, page 27543, announcing programbased on X.25 Link and Network Layer Protocols, five Packet Switching HighLevel Protocols, and AUTODIN Mode I Protocol.) The request from NCSL hasbeen considered under the NVLAP Procedures (Title 15, Part 7, CFR 7.18,addition to an established laboratory accreditation program), and has beenfound feasible and relevant to the existing program. Program feasibilityhas been established by defining the accreditation requirements necessaryto demonstrate capability to test software against FIPS 151.The following plans for the workshops have been established:<T3>1. Purpose. </T3>The workshop will provide all interested persons withan opportunity to review and participate in establishing technical criteria,requirements, and procedures for evaluation and accreditation of applicantlaboratories.<T3>2. Procedure: </T3>The workshop will be an informal meeting. The presidingNIST chairperson will allocate the time available for discussion of eachissue to be addressed, and exercise such authority as may be necessaryto insure the equitable and efficient conduct of the workshop and to proceedin an orderly manner.<T3>3. Provisions: </T3>This workshop will be open to the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">Documents in Public Record</ITAG>A summary record of the meeting will be prepared and made available forinspection and copying in the NVLAP program office, Building 411, RoomA124, Gaithersburg, Maryland.<ITAG tagnum="6">Raymond G.
