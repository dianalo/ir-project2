The London-based human rights group urged the Hong Konggovernment to stop its forced repatriation program, which began inDecember to ease the burden of detaining the refugees.   ``The fundamental rights of people who face a genuine risk ofpersecution are being violated,'' said the report, which was basedon a recent fact-finding mission to Hong Kong.   The Hong Kong government called the report ``unfounded'' andsaid it was committed to its policy of sending the Vietnamese home.   Amnesty accused the Hong Kong government of mistreating the 51boat people who were forcibly returned to Vietnam in December.   It quoted witnesses as saying security forces dragged them fromthe Chi Ma Wan detention center in a dawn raid on Oct. 31, usingkicks, beatings and choke holds.   Hong Kong's Secretary of Security Geoffrey Barnes said ``aminimum of necessary force was used on that occasion.''   ``There is no truth whatsoever in the accusation that people atChi Ma Wan were ill-treated or rendered unconscious,'' he said in astatement.   The refugees were then taken to another detention center, thePhoenix House. Early Dec. 12, hundreds of security forces in riotgear brought them to the international airport.   During that operation, reporters did not see any evidence ofbrutality.   The report also charged the government with quashinginvestigations of official misconduct in the camps, citing twoincidents when 200 boat people were allegedly beaten and kicked bysecurity forces last year. In the High Island Detention Center, itsaid, unruly boat people are routinely locked in empty subdividedcargo containers for several days.   The report said many Vietnamese feared that if they spoke upabout abuses, they faced ``possible retribution by the police andrisked unfavorable treatment in the screening process.''   Amnesty criticized the screening process to separate refugeeswith the right to find a new country from ``economic migrants,''who will be forced back to Vietnam.   Of the 40,000 Vietnamese awaiting screening, an estimated 85percent face forced repatriation. They make up the bulk of boatpeople who arrived after mid-June 1988, when Hong Kong stoppedautomatically granting refugee status.   Under the screening process, boat people are given a hearingwith an immigration officer. They can appeal the decision once.   As of Tuesday, 7,567 Vietnamese had been refused refugee status,and 1,889 had lost appeals. So far, 997 have voluntarily returnedto Vietnam.   Amnesty said that during the screening process, boat peoplereceive no legal advice and are often interviewed by immigrationofficers with scant knowledge of the human rights situation inVietnam.   The report cited one case of an immigration officer who seemedunaware that Vietnam had once been divided into two countries, aCommunist north and a capitalist south.   Another case involved a young Vietnamese who was refused refugeestatus even though he allegedly was fleeing a five-year term of``political imprisonment'' in Vietnam.   An emergency intervention of the office of the U.N. HighCommissioner for Refugees provided the man refugee status.   However, Barnes defended the screening process, saying Hong Konghas given the ``benefit of the doubt'' to many refugees.   But he said the colony would proceed with forced repatriation.   ``They have no alternative but to return to Vietnam to restarttheir lives,'' he said. ``It would be wrong and cannot be humane toleave them in detention indefinitely.''   Vietnam has promised not to prosecute or mistreat the boatpeople for fleeing their homeland. But the Amnesty report said itfears that local officials may persecute those who return.   Timothy Raison, a British parliamentarian who visited some ofthe forcibly repatriated boat people, has said he found no sign ofpersecution.</TEXT></DOC>
