(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``You probably ought to go see LeoSchwab,'' said the phoner, a member of Silicon Valley's vastbrotherhood of computer hackers. ``He's a wizard. Even wears acape.''   So, off to see the wizard, following if not the Yellow Brick Roadthe _ too good to be true _ Golden Gate Bridge en route.   The wizard, capeless, opened the door of a brand-new suburbantown house. His lair _ absent clouds of steam or a wizardlyswitching panel _ was equipped with California wall hangings andlaid-back furniture. Schwab himself, lanky-tall, whose unlined faceof 24 years was framed by an auburn beard, was further deflationary:   ``I'm not a wizard. Maybe a semi-wizard.''   Schwab was to demonstrate, however, that he could make a computer_ essentially only an electronic box that can either say yes or no _pirouette magically under his spell.   ``Computers consume almost all my waking hours,'' said Schwab,whose ``sleep phase'' runs from about 3 a.m. to 10 a.m.   This is one of the identifying field marks of the hacker breed.Dedicated, long, oddball hours.   ``I want to write software and make a lot of money (a common butnot always present field mark of a hacker) and (almost an invariablehallmark of the species) have fun.''   Fun at the expense of the nation's computer networks thattransfer billions of dollars of bank money daily, monitor heartbeatsin hospitals, command satellites in space, switch all those zillionsof phone calls, is not what hacking is about. Hackers resent beinggrouped with those who maliciously plant worms and viruses thatbefuddle computers. Hackers call them crackers.   Schwab has been too engrossed getting a unicycle to juggle redballs on a computer screen to waste time goosing Ma Bell.   Leo's apotheosis to semi-wizardry is not untypical.   He's a native of the San Francisco Bay area where kids absorb thebinary system almost before they learn to stay afloat in hot tubs.Hacking, of course, is now worldwide, but its Bethlehem was at MITin Cambridge, Mass., and then Silicon Valley. Leo's father was amechanic, his mother a housewife. They produced a Leo gifted with avivid imagination.   ``I talked to myself a lot and daydreamed, usually with me in thestarring role.''   Once upon a time, wizardry at an early age was apt to getchannelized into such nerdy outlets as violin lessons ordifferential calculus on a slide rule. Fortunately for Leo, hisbirth coincided roughly with that of the personal computer where themaster could fulfill his dreams on the wondrous keyboard of anelectronic slave.   If you could afford one. Leo couldn't.   But the Byte Shop had just become Marin County's first computerstore. Leo became its first ``pest'' or embryonic wizard aliasfreeloading hacker.   ``They were permissive. They let me run anything. I played Pongin color on an Apple. Amazing! It was a black art then.''   In the ninth grade Leo was introduced to the computer lab at SanRafael High. ``I spent every spare moment there. I wanted to realizethings in my imagination on the screen. I had a lot of kooky ideas Icouldn't realize in other ways. I rarely achieved this because mymind was three years ahead of the technology.''   Leo made do buying $6 disk drives for Paleozoic computers whilewaiting for the industry to catch up. He meanwhile devised his firstcomputer game while daydreaming in algebra class.   ``Then I graduated and suddenly was without a machine. AComputerland threw me out for the last time.''   What was an apprentice wizard to do?   Leo had had a newspaper route. ``Everyone on it found their paperprecisely where they wanted it. Every day.''   Such diligence had earned him the scratch to buy a $1,200Commodore computer when they first came out. Computer games had beensweeping the country, making their teen-age inventors almost as richas rock stars or junk bond salesmen.   The computer's combination of speed, programmability and endlesspermutations makes it a natural for games by quick minds. One of thefirst was concocted in the late 1950s by the three young programmersat Bell Laboratories in New Jersey. The idea of the game, dubbedCore War, was to wipe out the memory of an opponent's computer. Allin fun, of course.   One of the players, ironically, was Robert Morris, whose son issuspected of having infected a major computer network last fall inwhat he may have thought was a hack but others think a crack.   In the '70s, computer games did for electronics what the rumbleseat once did for necking. Everyone wanted to try out the newtechnology. By the original Hacker Ethic evolved first at MIT anddescribed by Steven Levy in his landmark history, ``Hackers,''computers were a gift from the gods to man's ingenuity and should bethus forevermore free. Money got its nose in the tent, however, withthe rage for game software, Donkey Pong, Pac-Man, Frogger.   Levy describes how Ken Williams, a college dropout, came to foundOn-Line Systems in the Sierra foothills where pubescent andpost-adolescent programmers created fun and games in an atmosphereof anarchy and funny-smelling smoke so laid-back it risked topplinginto the Pacific. Bob Davis, a one-time musician and hash-housecook, signed on after meeting Williams in a liquor store where hewas working and taught himself to become a wizard game programmer.   John Harris, facing a nerdified future as son of a banker in SanDiego, came of age just as games did and went to work for On-Linewith a more generous royalty agreement than salary. One of his gamesat one point paid him $36,000 in royalties in a single month.   Leo Schwab just missed the gold rush.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
