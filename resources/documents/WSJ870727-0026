Martin Pollner, attorney for the company's new management, told United Press International that Wedtech will maintain a small staff to continue pressing lawsuits against former officials. The sale of assets will be supervised by federal bankruptcy court. Officials weren't available for comment. As previously reported, Wedtech is being investigated by federal and state prosecutors on its procurement of government contracts. The public-corruption scandal forced the Bronx, N.Y., company, once highly successful, to seek protection from creditors' lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. </TEXT></DOC>
