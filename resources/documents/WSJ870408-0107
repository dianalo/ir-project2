Bellcore, as the venture is known, is planning to stop focusing exclusively on research-and-development projects that benefit all of its seven owners. Instead, says Irwin Dorros, executive director of technical services, more of the facility's work &quot;will be committed, executed and delivered to satisfy separate&quot; regional Bells.    The move to proprietary projects will, among other things, forestall U S West Inc.'s withdrawal from Bellcore. In January, the Denver-based regional Bell notified the venture that it might pull out because of Bellcore's exclusive focus on projects that benefit all seven Bells. U S West also is frustrated with Bellcore's cumbersome decision-making, but the company now says it likely will remain in the venture.    But more significantly, the coming change means Bellcore increasingly will have to compete with private concerns and perhaps universities for its seven owners' research-and-development projects, Bellcore and Bell company officials say. Some of these officials also want Bellcore to take on customers other than the regional Bells, so that it may grow. Terms of the Bell system breakup, however, prohibit Bellcore from serving the broader market.    Bellcore was created in the Bell system breakup, and its mission is to serve as the Bells' research-and-development arm. One of the world's largest research-and-development organizations, it has an annual budget exceeding $900 million, 7,200 employees and hundreds of projects under way. Under terms of the breakup, its research work can be applied only to maintaining and improving the Bells' phone networks. Bellcore can't do research for outsiders or the Bell companies' unregulated units -- for example, those in the cellular mobile-telephone business.    The move to proprietary research for individual owners is one of several issues currently being studied by a five-year planning group at Bellcore. The group also is trying to address criticism about the venture's slow decision-making process. Although a final plan hasn't been approved yet, officials at Bellcore and some Bell companies say it's a foregone conclusion that the venture will begin proprietary research sometime in early 1989.    Each of the seven regional Bells also is establishing, in varying degrees, internal research-and-development groups. The groups are designed, among other things, to help the companies take technological breakthroughs and incorporate them into products and services, a concept they refer to as technology transfer. Moreover, the regional companies increasingly require research and development related to their unregulated businesses, such as cellular mobile telephone.    The changes at Bellcore and its parents highlight the almost inevitable conflicts in such joint ventures, peculiar entities in which competitors wed resources in an attempt to cooperate. In the case of Bellcore, the pressures have been particularly heavy because of rapid advances in telecommunications technology. Despite its size, Bellcore and its owners have concluded that the venture can't fulfill all their research-and-development needs.    &quot;There is more work than Bellcore can do,&quot; says Bailey Geeslin, Nynex Corp.'s marketing and technology vice president and a member of the planning task force. Adds Bellcore's Mr. Dorros: &quot;Technology is moving so quickly, we can't cover it all.&quot;    The regional Bells already turn to others for some proprietary research. For example, several companies said they call upon manufacturers of switching equipment to develop proprietary software for the switches.    Bellcore's owners, including U S West, praise its work highly and say they couldn't duplicate a similar facility, more than 40% of whose employees formerly worked for the renowned Bell Laboratories, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s research unit. And they add that Bellcore will continue its present focus of setting standards for the phone networks and phone equipment, analyzing technology and assuring the quality of gear made by other vendors.    Nonetheless, the Bell companies note that the need for proprietary work is inevitable. &quot;As our interests and directions diverge, the way that Bellcore performs its work for us has to change,&quot; says Mr. Geeslin. &quot;I don't think there is any question about Bellcore doing proprietary work. The task force is considering what kinds of limits to put on it.&quot;    &quot;We have to evolve with changes in the industry,&quot; says Rocco J. Marano, Bellcore's president.    In addition to U S West and Nynex, the other regional Bells are Ameritech, BellSouth Corp., Pacific Telesis Group, Bell Atlantic Corp. and Southwestern Bell Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
