All too quickly, we moved from celebrating the Cold War'sdramatic conclusion to struggling with the cold reality of internationalpolitical unrest, widespread economic woes and the threat of war in the MiddleEast.;    It would have been nice to have a year or two of tranquillity inbetween. Unfortunately, the world doesn't work that way.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  1991 POSES CHALLENGES, BUT THE GLASS IS ATLEAST HALF FULL  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary.Larry Jinks is publisher of the Mercury News.  </MEMO><TEXT>     So, we start 1991 with at least 320,000 troops preparing for possible warin the Middle East, with mounting evidence that we are in a recession thatcould be a mean one, with an intractable U.S. budget deficit that no one seemsto be able to deal with effectively, with a multibillion-dollar state budgetshortfall challenging incoming Gov. Pete Wilson, with a growing homelessnessproblem in this country (and this community) that shames all of us.;    Thenthere's the savings and loan crisis (which seems only to get worse), thegrowing concern over the stability of our banking and insurance systems, ourcontinuing struggle with drugs and depressing evidence that our educationalsystem isn't doing the job that needs to be done.;    The list could go on,but I don't really mean for this collection of beginning-of-the-year thoughtsto be an exercise in unrelieved pessimism. I think of myself as an optimistwith reservations, despite the paragraphs above.;    Actually, there's much tobe optimistic about.;    The Cold War truly is over, and that gives the worldsome breathing room it hasn't had for generations. We are left with hugepolitical and economic problems, but they are less frightening to deal withthan the threat of mutual annihilation that we lived with for so long.;    Isee some signs of a growing commitment to face up to our more serious economicproblems. It remains to be seen whether our political leaders have thecombination of skill, commitment and courage to do the job, but I'm stillhopeful they can and will take effective action without being forced to by aneconomic cataclysm.;    In California we have a new governor who has areputation as a problem-solver. He has a lot to solve. I'm optimistic thatPete Wilson will end a long period of inaction in the governor's office, andhelp this state move ahead.;    We live in an area that continues to be richin natural and human resources, with extraordinary economic energy. SantaClara County has problems, too, but most of the world would happily settle forwhat we have. In San Jose, Susan Hammer is taking over a fundamentally healthycity as she moves into the mayor's office.;    I described myself as anoptimist with reservations. The reservations have to do with how we approachour problems. If we look for quick and painless fixes, if we focus our publicenergy on instant gratification, then I see a gloomy future indeed. But if wedraw on our reserves of wisdom, patience and determination, we can work ourway through the thicket.;    The most pressing immediate issue, of course, iswhat to do in the Middle East. This paper's position has been to favor strong,collective action against Saddam Hussein, but to firmly oppose going to war. Iremain convinced we should combine sanctions and patience and avoid igniting aconflict that would take countless lives and set off a chain of events wecould not control.;    Whatever happens, 1991 is bound to be another strongnews year. At the Mercury News, we're committed to present that news to ourreaders as effectively and compellingly and accurately as we can.;    I shouldemphasize the word &quot;accurately&quot; in that statement. Our reportingresponsibility is to tell you what's happening in as clear and straight afashion as possible.;    Some of our critics would disagree. There are those,for example, who argue that we should put a positive spin on economic news,that we have a responsibility to help boost consumer confidence. I think thatapproach is at best naive and at worst potentially damaging. Consumers -- ourreaders -- deserve the facts as we understand them.;    At the Mercury News,we have our own special problems and opportunities as we enter 1991.;    Adownturn in advertising revenues has caused us to tighten up on costs, as somany companies have done. Our goal has been to do that in ways that protectthe strength of our newspaper and its basic services to readers andadvertisers.;    During the past year we have been installing two new offsetpresses which will bring a new level of printing quality to our papers during1991. We'll be working to take full advantage of this development.;    Insummary, I'm convinced the new year can be a good one for us at the MercuryNews, for our area and its people, for our state and nation and for the world-- but we'll need some luck and a lot of wisdom and hard work to make ithappen.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Larry Jinks column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910106  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  845  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 6, 199100006190,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
