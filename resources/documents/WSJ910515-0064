His quest has takenhim from Peru to India to Japan, where he found evidencesuggesting that even the emperor's family itself may bedescended from Jewish tribes routed from Israel in 722 B.C.   So it looked like a match made in heaven when ChimaOnyeulo, a man feeling Jewish and very lost, came to RabbiAvichail for guidance last year. Since the mid-1970s, Mr.Onyeulo, a member of the Ibos of southern Nigeria, haswandered from Africa to Italy to Jerusalem, insisting that heand his people are the remnant of a Jewish tribe that fledJerusalem two millenniums ago. Now, says Mr. Onyeulo, whocalls himself Chaim, many Ibos want to return to Israel.</LP><TEXT>   But Rabbi Avichail, founder and guiding light of Amishav,a group dedicated to retrieving lost Jews, could do no morethan sympathize with the African's odyssey. The Bibleprophesies in several places that 10 tribes of Jews -- theDiaspora -- will indeed return to Israel someday -- but fromthe East, Rabbi Avichail says. Except for Ethiopia's Jews,who are a special case, Amishav (which means &quot;my peoplereturn&quot;) isn't interested in Africans living to the south.Mr. Onyeulo was out of luck.   &quot;I sent him to an anthropologist,&quot; Rabbi Avichail says.   Hard as it is for some people to accept, the road toredemption isn't for everybody, particularly when EliyahuAvichail is manning the gates. He founded Amishav in 1975.Its mission, &quot;to return the dispersed of Israel to Judaism,to the nation, and to the land of Israel,&quot; seeks tojump-start the biblical prophecy that says the Messiah willcome only after the souls of all 12 Jewish tribes come backto Jerusalem.   Two of those tribes are an easy matter, because theysupposedly reside in the West and live as Jews. But the other10, which the Bible says were dispersed across Asia after theAssyrians smashed the First Jewish Temple more than 2,700years ago, pose problems.   For one thing, many of the lost Jewish souls Amishav hasfound now occupy Muslim bodies, Rabbi Avichail says. Theylive in such countries as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Burma,whose governments aren't on good terms with Israel and takeparticular umbrage at rabbis' performing circumcisions andother Jewish rites on their people. Nor are Israeli officialstoo keen about Amishav's cause. Most would still rather helpJews in places like Ethiopia, Albania and the Soviet Union,than retrieve long-lost Jews in Bangladesh.   &quot;You're an American,&quot; says Rabbi Avichail, wheeling on anunsuspecting journalist. &quot;Can you go to Afghanistan for us?&quot;   Though Amishav is having problems repatriating Pathans inPakistan and the Chiang-Min in China, the group has drawnmany enthusiastic Africans. Indeed, the dramatic airlift ofEthiopian Jews to Israel in the 1970s seems to have fireddreams across the continent.   &quot;We are 180 million Jews in Africa,&quot; says Uriel Ben Moshe,a Basa tribesman from Cameroon and a rabbinical student at ayeshiva here. &quot;The leaders of the Jewish nation today have nounderstanding of genealogy before the Second Temple&quot; era,roughly the time of Christ.   Like many other Orthodox Jews, Mr. Ben Moshe, 51, wearsdark, formal suits, but dreadlocks under his black bowler. Hehimself went through formal conversion rites to becomeJewish, but he has been petitioning the rabbinate for years,without success, to recognize the Basa as Jewish by birth.Such recognition would entitle the tribe to move to Israelunder the Jewish state's &quot;law of return.&quot;   Mr. Onyeulo, the Nigerian, opted to fight rather thanconvert. By petitioning in rabbinical court for recognitionas a Jew, he hoped to set a precedent for all Ibo tribesmen.Among the documents he has gathered for his case are academicpapers by Ibo and other scholars, including a chapter from a1938 British book on the similarities between Ibos andIsraelites.   Like Jews, the Ibos practice ritual circumcision, but onboth sexes. They hold ceremonies similar to the bar mitzvahto celebrate manhood, and they abide by rules similar tokosher laws governing how livestock is slaughtered. Not allIbo rituals derive from Judaism. To designate his heir, forinstance, an Ibo father spits into the hands of his favoriteson. &quot;Judaism is something we were born with,&quot; Mr. Onyeulosays, &quot;but in a local form.&quot;   In November, the regional rabbinical court of Tel Avivissued its ruling. The three rabbinical judges wrote that&quot;since Mr. Onyeulo refused to undergo a formal conversionthey could not recognize him as Jewish.&quot; But he has one lasthope. Back home in Nigeria, he says, a tribesman namedInnocent has been having visions about Ibo history. When therevelations are transcribed, Mr. Onyeulo plans to submit thenew evidence to rabbinical court.   Mr. Ben Moshe, the Basa tribesman, says African Jews arevictims of racism. After decades of neglect, he says, Israelhelped Ethiopia's Jews only after the U.N. General Assemblyhad passed a resolution equating Zionism with racism. Theairlift, Mr. Ben Moshe says, was Israel's token response tothe U.N. reproach.   Rabbi Avichail, echoing rabbinical thought throughout theages, says scripture, not race, determines who is a Jew.Anyone can practice Jewish customs, he says, but that doesn'tmean he has Jewish ancestry, or a Jewish soul.   &quot;Why should we help gentiles come to Israel?&quot; the rabbiasks.   Two years ago, Amishav helped Rebecca Rei, 32, move herefrom northeast India. Miss Rei is a member of the Shinlungtribe, many of whose members believe they are descendants ofthe lost Israelite tribe called the Menashe. Shinlung songsrecount crossing the Red Sea from Egypt into Israel, Miss Reisays.   When she immigrated, Miss Rei thought she was leading aShinlung exodus to the Holy Land. But it hasn't turned outthat way. Since she arrived, her mother and sisters, amongothers, have tried in vain to obtain formal Jewishconversions. The Israeli rabbinate won't give rabbispermission to convert more Shinlung, Miss Rei says. Andwithout proper conversions, the Israeli consulate in Bombaywon't even issue them tourist visas.   Frustrated from above, Rabbi Avichail says he is changinghis strategy vis-a-vis the Shinlung. Instead of settlinglarge numbers here, he now plans to bring just 50 or soShinlung to Israel for religious training, then send most ofthem back to Asia to teach their people. After 20 years ofliving as Jews, the Shinlung should be ready to emigrate, therabbi hopes.   Through exile circles in Rome and New York, Rabbi Avichailhas also come in contact with leaders of the Pathan tribe ofsouthern Asia. The 15 million Pathans, including devoutMuslims and fierce &quot;Mujahadeen&quot; guerrillas, practice manyJewish traditions and live in the mountains of Afghanistanand Pakistan, where the Bible says the lost tribes were lost.Pathan leaders, says Rabbi Avichail, told him they don't caremuch for their Jewish roots but would love some Israeliweapons.   Rabbi Avichail wants to send the Pathans humanitarian aid,&quot;so they understand we're brothers, even if they are Muslimsnow.&quot;   For the time being, the world might be better off if thelost tribes stay put. When all Jewish souls do return toIsrael, says the book of Zechariah, they will settle in whatis now Lebanon and Jordan.   &quot;Israel will have to grow,&quot; Rabbi Avichail confirms,&quot;though I can't say when.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
