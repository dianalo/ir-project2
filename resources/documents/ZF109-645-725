 Workstation: 640K RAM (EMS 4.0memory recommended), one floppy disk drive, DOS 2.0 or later.andM;In Short: The next-generation network operating system from Novell, NetWare386's simple installation, dynamic self-configuration, and virtuallyunlimited file system capabilities provide companies with a robust networkOS, particularly for server-based applications with NLMs.andM;NetWare 386 3.1andM;Everyone agrees that Novell holds the lion's share of the PC LAN market,mainly because NetWare has been widely judged the first, fastest, and bestLAN operating system for serious applications.andP;  NetWare has consistentlyshown itself to be the fastest performer, while including the management andoperational features most needed in a modern file-server operating system.andO;With the new version's speedier file system, support for removable storagemedia, enhanced support for add-on modules, easier installation, and morecomplete error reporting, the $7,995 NetWare 386 offers many worthwhile extracapabilities.andM;THE REAL NETWARE 386?andM;Novell pioneered the LAN in the early '80s and, with NetWare 386 3.0, thecompany continued to break new ground.andP;  But NetWare 386 3.0 functioned merelyas a warm-up for Version 3.1.andP;  Novell brought its next-generation operatingsystem to market before it included all of the features the company felt itneeded--something that Novell concedes by offering a free upgrade to Version3.1.andP;  This doesn't mean Version 3.0 didn't work or was full of bugs.andP;  Infact, for a new operating system the product actually contained relativelyfew bugs, and Novell corrected them immediately--a tribute to the quality ofthe company's engineering teams.andM;However, the first release of Novell's NetWare 386 needed better developmenttools and a few adjustments before it could realize maximum performance forits file services and better integration of other products.andM;Novell fine-tuned the already speedy file system, squeezing out a littleextra performance for the new release by optimizing many repetitive routines.andO;Mounting volumes--a way of telling NetWare that a disk is available for usersto access--works three times faster under Version 3.1 than under 3.0.andM;The new version of Netware also does not cache deleted files, and Novellprogrammers have rewritten the disk drivers so that it takes a maximum of 4seconds to delete users or groups from the bindery.andP;  Formerly, that procedurecould take up to 2 minutes.andM;Novell added support for removable media, making it much easier for vendorsto write drivers for CD-ROMs, electro-optical drives, WORM drives, andproducts like Iomega's Bernoulli box.andP;  Some vendors used elaborateworkarounds to make their removable products work under 3.0, but 3.1 nowincludes the needed function calls.andP;  3.1's Monitor NetWare Loadable Moduleincludes options for mounting and dismounting volumes, allowing a smoothintegration of user access to the mounted volumes.andM;THE NETWARE ADVANTAGEandM;NetWare holds a potentially big advantage over LAN Manager in multiple-OScompatibility.andP;  Novell plans support for Sun Microsystems' NFS and Apple'sAFP file systems.andP;  Soon users of these computers will be able to store theirfiles on a NetWare 386 3.1 server.andP;  Although Novell announced this supportfor Version 3.1, so far it is absent from the released product.andP;  And whileOS/2's HPFS includes support for long filenames and extended file attributes,Microsoft has not announced any other file system support except that alreadyincluded for DOS.andM;NetWare 3.1 already includes many other new features.andP;  The server nowautoloads specified NLMs, enabling an unattended server to return to itsready state after a power outage.andP;  The workstation software also supportsexpanded and extended memory to allow the workstation more room for DOSapplications.andM;NetWare 386 is designed to help the network administrator succeed in his orher maintenance and troubleshooting tasks.andP;  The product's maturity shows inthe way it reports error messages.andP;  When we left the cable disconnected fromthe server and tried to start the OS, NetWare 386 responded, &quot;The networkcable is not connected to the computer.&quot;andP;  NetWare also reported receiving anunusual number of bad packets from one workstation.andP;  Upon inspecting thenetwork connection, we found the culprit: a small crack in the T connector.andM;Novell displays its commitment to supporting and complying with industrystandards.andP;  In its current version, NetWare 386 supports ODI (Open Data-LinkInterface) workstation drivers, allowing one network card to use multipleprotocol stacks simultaneously.andP;  In addition, NetWare 386 supportsinterprocess communications like Named Pipes, streams, SMB (server messageblocks), and sockets.andP;  By implementing these standards, NetWare providesbetter interoperability with network applications.andM;COMPLETE NLM SUPPORTandM;Version 3.0 offered limited support for NetWare Loadable Modules, but with3.1 NLMs gain complete functionality.andP;  Version 3.1 includes Btrieve, remoteconsole, and print services NLMs.andP;  Together, these NLMs provide valuableservices to NetWare users.andM;The Btrieve NLM is a high-performance key-indexed record manager fordevelopers.andP;  As a back-end data management service, it supplies a goodfoundation for server-based applications and maintains compatibility with the10,000 existing Btrieve applications.andM;The remote-console NLM allows a system administrator to monitor the serverinformation from a workstation.andP;  This feature fulfills a network manager'sdream.andP;  An administrator can sit at any workstation and monitor any server onthe network.andP;  In addition to monitoring, the administrator's computer acts asif it were the server console, allowing an administrator to load and unloadNLMs and completely control the server.andM;The print services NLM allows a network to spool and queue print jobs for upto eight printers; it also allows authorized users to access and manipulateprint jobs.andP;  While this NLM performs much better than the older NetWare 2.15software, it runs relatively slow compared with LAN Manager 2.0's PrintManager.andM;At present, NetWare 386 can boast of many more add-on services than LANManager.andP;  Since NetWare has the largest market share, many software vendorshave converted the 2.1x version of their utility into an NLM for NetWare 386.andO;Companies such as Fresh Technology Group, Blue Lance, and BrightworkDevelopment market dozens of add-on products for NetWare.andM;IN THE CLIENTandM;On the workstation side, NetWare 386 3.1 contains many enhancements.andP;  OS/2client stations now include full IPX/SPX, NetBIOS, and Named Pipe support.andO;The introduction of Named Pipes paves the way for applications appearing in12 to 18 months that will use this powerful peer-to-peer communicationsarchitecture (see the sidebar &quot;Named Pipes and Client/Server Computing&quot;).andM;NetWare 386's new SHELL software will please DOS users.andP;  By supportingexpanded and extended memory, NetWare frees 34K of conventional memory forapplications.andP;  Finally, users can unload NetBIOS and the workstationsoftware, freeing memory when they don't need the network.andM;Integration with Windows 3.0 makes it easy for users to attach to fileservers and printers without exiting Windows.andP;  With Windows' NETPOPUPprogram, workstations receive broadcast messages in a window withoutdisrupting any running applications.andP;  However, PC LAN Labs continues toreceive reports of terminated print jobs and garbled e-mail when running allversions of NetWare through the Windows drivers.andP;  Anyone switching to Windowsor installing networks must carefully consider the merger of these twotechnologies.andM;UPGRADE, INSTALLATION, BOOT-UPandM;Upgrading from 3.0 to 3.1 could not be easier.andP;  Simply put System Disk-1 indrive A:, type LOAD A:INSTALL, and 15 minutes later you're finished.andP;  NetWare386 3.0 would upgrade only from Version 2.15 servers, but with 3.1 you canupgrade from servers as old as Version 2.0a.andM;Installing NetWare 386 is simple.andP;  Novell engineers have even found a way toavoid the tedious job of formatting the hard disk at installation time.andO;Instead, they format the disk on the fly--saving valuable configuration time.andO;Unlike the original, NetWare 386 does not require many years of computerexpertise to operate.andP;  However, understanding and implementing a networkrequires far more knowledge than it takes to type LOAD A:INSTALL.andP;  Werecommend using an experienced Novell value-added reseller (VAR) forinstallation and training.andM;NetWare 386 boots from a DOS partition (or floppy disk) and then runs theSERVER.EXE program.andP;  This program changes to i386 protected mode to accessthe NetWare partition.andP;  Since NetWare 386 cannot boot from the NetWarepartition, Novell recommends creating a 2MB DOS partition for booting.andP;  Thisloads the network operating system approximately ten times faster than from afloppy.andP;  Keep in mind, though, that your server copy of DOS needs to beproperly licensed.andM;While Novell made installing and setting up NetWare 386 on the file servermuch easier than it did in Advanced NetWare 286, the tools supplied forgenerating the workstation software haven't improved.andP;  Genning--that is,generating--the shells still requires some experience and patience.andO;Nevertheless, Version 3.1 does add a preferred server option that allows thenetwork administrator to select the server the users boots from, unlikeprevious versions that automatically selected the first responding server.andO;If you need help with installation or other problems, Novell supports itssoftware through a network of resellers across the country.andP;  It makes supportand upgrade contracts available to customers, and, in addition, companiessuch as Gateway Communications furnish in-depth support for their OEMversions of NetWare.andM;TODAY AND TOMORROWandM;Today NetWare 386's speed, huge storage space, minimum degradation underheavy loads, and easy installation will make networking life a lot morepleasant.andP;  In the future, it will serve as a rich environment for theintroduction of a new generation of server-based applications.andM;NetWare 386 reflects Novell's experience designing frontier network operatingsystems and represents major improvements in LAN technology.andP;  However, Novellhas yet to deliver all the things it announced for Version 3.1, includingsupport for Sun Microsystems' NFS and Apple's AFP file systems.andP;  A powerful,robust network operating system isn't born overnight, and it will takeanother year or so for NetWare 386 to expand and mature.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
