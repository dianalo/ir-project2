The Thursday night incident, the first involving one of thesecret MH-6 copters in the gulf, occurred during a routine patroland did not involve any hostile fire, officials said.   Both crewmen escaped injury and were picked up later in goodcondition, the Pentagon said. The helicopter sank.   Lt. Col. Keith Schneider, a Pentagon spokesman, said theincident occurred shortly before midnight local time, or around 4p.m. EDT Thursday. He identified the craft only as ``a U.S.helicopter operating in the central Persian Gulf on a routinesurveillance mission.''   But other officials, who asked not to be identified, said thehelicopter was an MH-6 flying from one of two large barges mooredin the northern Persian Gulf.   The barges are used to support mine-sweeping vessels as well asa number of special operations aircraft and commando teams, andalso as bases for surveillance missions to keep track of Iraniangunboats. The Navy and Defense Department officially refuse toacknowledge their existence.   The MH-6 is a small, fast reconnaissance aircraft that has beenarmed with several sophisticated weapons and night-time sensors andmodified to fly with little noise. A derivative of a bubble-canopycopter designed by Hughes Aircraft, it is thought to be flown byonly one unit of the Army's Special Operations Forces, based atFort Campbell, Ky.   Since arriving for gulf duty, the copters have at times beenreferred to by the nickname ``Sea Bat'' and also as AH-6s. The Armydoes not discuss the helicopter.   The helicopters were ferried to the gulf last summer, not longafter the U.S. Navy began protecting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers inthe gulf. Kuwait, a key ally of Iraq in the Iran-Iraq war,requested the protection after Iran began singling out the vesselsfor attack.   Former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger acknowledged thehelicopters' presence in the gulf after one of them intercepted andattacked an Iranian navy ship, the Iran Ajr, as it sowed mines ininternational waters of the gulf last Sept. 21.   Pentagon sources said Friday they were certain an effort wouldbe made to raise the downed helicopter, ``depending upon the depthof the water there.''   ``And we would very definitely like to have it back,'' oneofficial said.</TEXT></DOC>
