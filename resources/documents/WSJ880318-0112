IT WAS ONE of those days that a PR man wishes he'd stayed in bed -- or at least that he hadn't issued quite so many press releases.    The press kits were sent out a few weeks ago by the public-relations firm of Rubenstein, Wolfson andamp; Co. on behalf of its client Lippincott andamp; Margulies, which the PR firm described as &quot;the nation's pioneer identity consulting firm.&quot; The principal announcement was headlined: &quot;New Sunoco Ultra Race Car Design to Premier at Daytona 500.&quot;    According to the release, the Sunoco car would sport a new &quot;graphic design system that communicates the bold, strong Sunoco image&quot; -- such system having been designed by Lippincott andamp; Margulies's Karen Shinoda. Said Dennis Byrne, Sunoco's manager of communications programs: &quot;The final product is a design that provides our car unmistakable identity while traveling at speeds in excess of 150 mph.&quot;    And while traveling for a very short time. Explains Ms. Shinoda: &quot;In the 13th lap . . . Cale Yarborough's car spun out of control on the first turn,&quot; knocking out nine other vehicles. She waited to see if the Sunoco car would pass. It didn't.    &quot;The next thing I saw was the car's twisted wreck being pushed into the garage,&quot; says Ms. Shinoda. &quot;My design was unrecognizable except for the blue and gold Sunoco diamond on one side.&quot; She concludes: &quot;It's not often that a designer sees her efforts smash at 195 mph.&quot;    The PR firm's Matt Porter says philosophically: &quot;And so it goes.&quot;    In This Case, They   Could Blame Nature   HERE IS WHAT was supposed to happen, as explained last week to millions of readers of this newspaper and other publications around the world: As part of its much-heralded U.S. export program, Honda Motor Co. was to load the first batch of its U.S.-built Accord coupes onto a ship in Portland, Ore., and send the cars off to Tokyo. To make sure the U.S. saw the significance of this to the U.S.-Japan trade debate, Honda planned to broadcast the proceedings live across the U.S. by satellite.    Here is what did happen: Last week, Honda, with much fanfare and ceremony, including the satellite broadcast, loaded the Accords onto a ship in Portland, saw the ship sail for Tokyo -- and, a few days later, saw the ship sail right back to the U.S. Just a few days out of port, the ship, the Central Gulf Lines' cargo carrier Green Bay, hit rough seas, and its captain decided to head for terra firma -- which is to say, not Tokyo, but Portland.    Back in Portland last Sunday, workers found cracks caused by the bad weather in ballast tanks and the top of the fuel tank, says the U.S. Coast Guard.    No one, or car, on board was hurt and Honda is calling the delay merely &quot;unfortunate.&quot; The Green Bay was scheduled to make a second try yesterday, this time without benefit of ballyhoo.    And the Front-Runner,   By a Hair, Is -- Mammon!    FOR YEARS, the Boston Marathon steadfastly remained an unadulterated amateur event. No big prizes. No big PR machine -- and, eventually, almost no big-name runners; they were skipping Boston in favor of other cities' lucrative and commercial-minded races.    So two years ago, the Boston Athletic Association, which controls the marathon, acknowledged the hard facts and began offering cash prizes. And almost overnight, according to some not-at-all-disinterested parties, the grand old man of marathons became a money-grubber.    The critics include vendors who sell marathon memorabilia. Soon after the association's decision to make the race a big-money affair, it sued some of those vendors, alleging trademark violations.    Beau Tease Inc., a Boston shirt maker, and Mark Sullivan, a local retailer who sells Beau Tease shirts, fought the lawsuit. After a two-year legal battle, a U.S. District Court judge in Boston recently ruled that Beau Tease's shirts, which last year were imprinted with &quot;1987 Marathon&quot; instead of the trademarked &quot;Boston Marathon,&quot; didn't infringe on the association's trademarks.    Mickey Lawrence, president of Image Impact Inc., a New York firm that handles the marathon's licensed memorabilia, stands up for the suit: &quot;It costs money to run the race, and it has to come from somewhere,&quot; she says.    But the federal judge who decided the case wrote in his decision that the association's &quot;aggressive efforts to turn the race into a money maker have proved something of an embarrassment.&quot; And a former director of the marathon is also concerned. The race's directors, he says, &quot;are trying to do the right thing but have gotten overly zealous.&quot; -   Odds and Ends   THE COUP that wasn't: Reynolds Metals Co. frantically called reporters not long ago to retrieve a news release about the company's increased dividend. The release quoted chief executive William O. Bourke, referring to him as chairman. Trouble was, the chairmanship belongs to David P. Reynolds, a grandson of Reynolds's founder; Mr. Bourke is president. &quot;I screwed up,&quot; explains an embarrassed Bob Shaffer, the Reynolds public-relations official who typed the release on a personal computer. &quot;It was PC-itis.&quot; . . . What's in a name? Maybe a lot. Consider the name of this Cerritos, Calif., company: Radiant Technology Corp. Then consider that the name of Radiant's chairman is Romance (Joseph S.) and that the name of its director of research and applications is Flattery (David K.). Don't consider that the president's name is Kelly (Mark E.) or that the company produces furnaces used in making electronic components. </TEXT></DOC>
