The land, which was acquired over the past two years for$21 million, includes a 93,000-acre wildlife refuge in NorthCarolina and the so-called &quot;Cornfield&quot; at Antietam NationalBattlefield in Maryland, site of one of the bloodiest CivilWar battles.</LP><TEXT>   The gift by the Richard King Mellon Foundation is a rareshow of environmental philanthropy. Only 3.6% of allfoundation grant money goes to the environment, according tothe Foundation Center in New York, which tracks foundationgrants.   The Mellon Foundation, a leader in environmentalphilanthropy, purchased the properties through TheConservation Fund, an Arlington, Va.-based non-profit group.The fund selected the land from a government list ofecological and historical properties, many of which werethreatened by commercial development. The conservationorganization benefited from a sluggish real estate market,but often found itself competing with land developers.   The fund, for example, paid $8.8 million for the93,000-acre wildlife refuge in Alligator River, N.C.,outbidding a group of Japanese investors who wanted to minethe land.</TEXT></DOC>
