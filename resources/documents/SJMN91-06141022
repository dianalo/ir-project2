Lee,head of the Chemical Systems Division of United Technologies Corp., locatedjust south of San Jose. Lee is more than just alarmed. He also is takingdramatic action.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FLYING CLOSER TO THE GROUNDSHRINKING DEFENSE PROGRAMS PUT ROCKET MAKERIN A BIND  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Defense  </MEMO><TEXT>     The Chemical Systems Division, which builds solid rocket motors for themilitary, has gone through a crash program in recent years to trim costs andincrease manufacturing efficiency.;    Total employment in the division isdown by almost a third to 1,500 from a peak of 2,100 in 1988. At the sametime, United Technologies has invested more than $100 million in newproduction equipment and upgraded facilities.;    &quot;This industry will sift outits weak sisters,&quot; Lee says. &quot;We intend to be here.&quot;;    But surviving thepost-Cold War shakeout will be far from easy.;    There are five majorcompetitors in the solid rocket business, probably too many given the reduceddemand for missiles and satellites. The &quot;weak sisters,&quot; however, aren't likelyto quit without a fight. And the tactics could turn dirty, including cutthroatbidding that falls below the industry's operating cost.;    &quot;I'm not going tobid programs to go broke,&quot; says Lee, a former top civilian executive with theNavy who joined the Chemical Systems Division six years ago. &quot;That may mean wego broke by not bidding for any work.&quot;;    This potential dilemma illustratesthe tough choices facing many of Silicon Valley's defense contractors. Theshrinking defense budget has all but eliminated hopes for growth during the1990s. But contractors are often stuck with highly specialized technology withlimited applications in non-military markets.;    Most solid rocket buildersdepend on the Defense Department for technical reasons tied to the science ofrocketry.;    There are two ways to put a satellite in orbit: a liquid-fueledrocket or a solid-fueled rocket. Liquid-fueled rockets most often burn chilledgases, such as liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, to produce thrust.Solid-fueled rockets use dry chemicals based on powdered aluminum and amixture of ammonia and chlorine that is molded in precise shapes to burn at aspecific rate. Liquid rockets more costly;  Liquid rockets produce more thrustthan solid rockets but are more expensive to operate because of the need forinsulated holding tanks and complex pumping systems. Liquid rockets can't bekept in long-term storage, so solid rockets are preferred for missiles thatmust be kept in silos or warehouses awaiting the outbreak of war.;    Thehigher performance of liquid rockets gives them an edge in civilian spaceapplications, according to Jerry Gray, director of science and technologypolicy for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics inWashington.;    There will be only a &quot;limited market&quot; for solid-fuel rocketsto launch commercial satellites, says Gray, closing off solid rocket buildersfrom one of the few growth areas for most aerospace companies in the 1990s.;   Titan rocket cutbacks;  The Chemical Systems Division today reflects thoselimits. About 50 percent of the company's $350 million in 1990 sales come fromsolid rocket boosters for the Air Force's Titan IV rocket. But the Air Forceis now stretching out its schedule for Titan launches and may ultimatelyreduce the total number because the Pentagon is slashing the number ofsatellites it plans to put in orbit.;    Lee says the division's productionschedule for Titan boosters also will be extended &quot;in an effort to avoid ashutdown of production activities.&quot;;    Minuteman will end in 1993;  Anadditional 25 percent of the division's revenue comes from motors forlong-range nuclear missiles -- mostly the Air Force's Minuteman and the Navy'sTrident. While Trident work will continue until at least the year 2000, theMinuteman program will end in 1993.;    About 20 percent of revenue is tied toshort-range missiles, such as the booster motor for the submarine-launchedversion of the Tomahawk cruise missile.;     'Space maneuvering engines'; Only 5 percent of revenue comes from &quot;space maneuvering engines,&quot; motors thatpush satellites into higher orbits.;    Space maneuvering engines are the mainarea where Chemical Systems Division has a significant presence in thecivilian market, although efforts are under way to find civilian payloads forthe Titan IV.;    Layoffs, pay freeze;  Division sales for 1991 are expectedto drop below $300 million because of the slowdown in Titan production and theend of one contract for space maneuvering engines. As a result, the companyhas laid off 330 employees so far this year and announced a pay freeze inMarch.;    The division is still in the black, although Lee won't say by howmuch.;    &quot;We're profitable, otherwise we wouldn't be here,&quot; he says.;    Nosentiment;  United Technologies, a Hartford, Conn.-based diversified defenseand industrial company that builds everything from jet engines to airconditioners, insists on getting a reasonable return from its investment inthe Chemical Systems Division, according to Lee.;    Ranked 17th in theFortune 500 with sales of $21.4 billion last year and 192,600 employeesworldwide, United Technologies has no reason to be sentimental about a singledivision.;    And the division must produce that reasonable return withoutleaving the solid rocket business.;    'Nothing else that we can do'; &quot;There's nothing else that we can do. The facility is geared for one thing --solid rocket motors,&quot; says Frank Bayona Jr., president of Local 1201 of theInternational Union of Electronic Workers, which represents 225 productionemployees at the division.;    Chemical Systems Division is tucked into thefolds of the Coyote Hills off Metcalf Road, about 15 miles southeast ofdowntown San Jose in unincorporated Santa Clara County. Because of the dangerassociated with highly explosive chemicals, division operations are split intoclusters of small buildings spread over eight square miles.;    Environmentaland peace activists have targeted the division for several years, citing toxiccontamination of groundwater and air pollution from burning scrap fuel in openpits.;    Lee makes it clear he is frustrated with the division's inability torelocate away from what he calls &quot;frivolous demonstrations&quot; by peace groupsand pressure to immediately resolve all of its environmental problems.;    &quot;Wecannot, I repeat, cannot, appeal to every environmental whim or socialpoliteness that people want us to,&quot; he says.;    Ted Smith, executive directorof the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, responds that the Chemical SystemsDivision is &quot;looking for an environmental scapegoat&quot; to take the blame for allits problems.;    &quot;I'd rather be in a lower-cost area,&quot; Lee concludes, butsays the division's huge investment in plant and equipment makes relocatingimpossible.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MIKE LANGBERG, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910520  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,109  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday May 20, 199100141022,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
