Results (1) givethe composition of the material, (2) show its heterogeneity of compositon,and (3) demonstrate the limit of application of the method for the fibersanalyses. SIMS and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) analysesof one coated fiber segment were done. When elements are detected byboth techniques, reasonable agreement is observed between the results.SiC-CVD deposits are not uniform: they are rich in carbon close to thefiber and tend towards stoichiometry after a few microns. The coatedfibers are rich in oxygen and in free carbon. Analyses of a glass-ceramicmatrix/Nicalon SiC fiber (202) composite were performed using SIMS, EELSand Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX). 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
