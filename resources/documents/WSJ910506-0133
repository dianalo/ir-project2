Customerslooked at features, user support programs, future directions,compatibility -- everything but price, the marketers said.   But now, price wars -- the bugaboo of mature product lineslike color televisions -- are being waged in the personalcomputer software business.</LP><TEXT>   Three of the industry's biggest players are engaged invicious price promotions for their spreadsheets, wooing oneanother's customers with cut-price offers and giving awaycomplementary products. International Business Machines Corp.recently halved the price of its OS/2 operating system in aneffort to compete with Microsoft Inc.'s Windows. Now, wordprocessing is emerging as a pricing battleground.   Most software makers predict that the current round ofprice promotions will end this year and won't permanentlyhurt lofty profit margins. And they are trying to wage theirprice wars without actually cutting the prices that mostcustomers pay.   But the industry is playing a risky game. Customers rarelypay list prices for software anyway. Now, savvy buyers canoften get top quality software for less than half thediscounted &quot;street prices&quot; offered by mail-order houses andwarehouse stores. Software buyers could become as addicted todeals as auto buyers are to rebates.   &quot;We know it's much harder to raise a price than to lower aprice,&quot; says Bobby Orbach, a New York-based industryconsultant who once headed computer operations at discounter47th Street Photo.   William Zachmann, head of Canopus Research, Duxbury,Mass., notes that price cutting strategies are temptingbecause software production costs are tiny compared with the$300 discount price for much business software. Moreover,top-selling products in each category all perform the samebasic functions and incorporate most of the same specialfeatures, making premium pricing harder to explain.   To be sure, list prices aren't changing. And mail-orderprices have actually edged up in recent years becausesoftware publishers have stopped the quarterly discounting toresellers that they once relied on to meet sales targets.Robert Weiler, senior vice president, sales and marketing, atLotus Development Corp., says: &quot;I don't think prices areeroding.&quot; But he concedes that &quot;spikes of tactical pricingare going on.&quot;   For years, PC software vendors avoided price competitionbecause customers were wedded to a few standard products.Corporate buyers, in particular, remained loyal to Lotus's1-2-3 spreadsheet, Wordperfect Corp.'s WordPerfect wordprocessor and Ashton-Tate Corp.'s dBase data-base software.Each carried a list price of $495 or more and sold atdiscount for $250 or more. Buyers decided it was better topay the price than risk having unpopular software. Retailerspreferred the profits they made on expensive software.   Software publishers kept developing upgrades of theirsoftware that they sold to existing customers at a cut price.But they kept high prices on the products and snickered atsuggestions that consumers wanted lower prices. Says Mr.Zachmann of Canopus Research: &quot;Every industry comes up withsome explanation of why they're exempt from the laws of themarketplace. The fact is, any bozo can write software, andoften they do.&quot;   In 1989 Borland International Inc. of Scotts Valley,Calif., began pushing what it called &quot;competitive upgrades&quot;-- industry jargon for deep discounts for people who switchfrom a competitor's product. It sold its well-reviewedQuattro spreadsheet to 1-2-3 users for $99. And it begancutting into 1-2-3's 70% market share. &quot;Borland really setthe whole pricing issue on its ear,&quot; says Robert Brown, anAtlanta consultant.   The current round of price cuts exploded with customers'move to Microsoft Windows, a graphical operating system thatmakes many software programs easier to use. Windows has beenselling like hotcakes, and vendors are racing to developWindows software. Microsoft, which has a big head start inthe Windows market, hopes to dislodge the established leadersin spreadsheets, word processors and graphics. To grab orhold market share, many of Microsoft's competitors haveresorted to cutting prices.   Richard Pickett, president of Merisel of El Segundo,Calif., the second-biggest software distributor, says theprice wars reflect vendors' desperation to capture marketshare in the Windows market. &quot;People believe the quicker theyget out with a product and the more installed base they have,the better it will be for them long term,&quot; he says.   Lotus still isn't ready to start selling its Windowsversion of 1-2-3, but as market leader, it won't want to riskcheapening its key product. To counter Microsoft's thrust, itgave away its $495 Ami Pro word processor for Windows witheach sale of its highend 1-2-3. The action seeded Ami Pro ina lot of companies that hadn't tried it previously, Lotussays.   But such an approach is also risky. &quot;I believe it has hurtthe corporate image. It makes them look a little toodesperate,&quot; says Nancy McSharry, an analyst with marketresearcher International Data Corp. Lotus ended thatpromotion April 30, as scheduled, although it still has a$129 upgrade to Ami from other word processors.   After Lotus began its promotion, Microsoft's chairman,William Gates, warned that &quot;Lotus shouldn't get in a pricewar with someone who has more money than they do.&quot; Microsoftbegan an extensive direct-mail campaign, offering a $129price for its $495 Excel to customers who said they used aspreadsheet. That program ended April 30 when Lotus's Amigiveaway stopped. Borland, which hasn't introduced a Windowsspreadsheet, sells the new version of Quattro Pro for $129 toother spreadsheet users.   Competitors with smaller market shares are going further.Computer Associates, which mostly sells mainframe software,cut the list price on its venerable Supercalc PC spreadsheet70% to $149. Sanjay Kumar, senior vice president of planningfor Computer Associates, says that &quot;given the commoditynature of spreadsheets . . . it will be hard for customers tojustify spending hundreds of dollars more for Lotus 1-2-3,Excel or Quattro Pro.&quot;   The idea that pricing doesn't matter to corporatecustomers &quot;has been the conventional wisdom,&quot; says J.T.McDonald, document processing manager for Software PublishingCorp., Mountain View, Calif. But he says &quot;in Windows, pricingis a much more germane issue&quot; because corporate customers arespending lots of money to upgrade computers and also have tobuy lots of new software at once. Software Publishing justannounced its first competitive upgrade with the introductionof Professional Write Plus, a Windows word processor.   Still, most software vendors hope to differentiate betweenprice-sensitive individuals and deep-pockets corporatebuyers, just as the airlines try to establish differentpricing levels for business flyers and vacationers, saysJeffrey Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter, a newsletter basedin Watertown, Mass. He notes that most upgrades requirecredit card numbers rather than corporate purchase orders.   Mr. Tarter predicts that price competition in the Windowsmarket is likely to get even hotter. &quot;Everyone in thesoftware business is deeply concerned,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
