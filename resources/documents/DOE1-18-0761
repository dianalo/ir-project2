Transmission throughmembranes of boron nitride was measured in situ during exposure to xrays. Membranes darkened considerably with the transmission through atypical membrane falling from 50% to 20% after absorbing {similar_to}250kJ/cm{sup 3} of x rays. Changes in local film stress were measured witha simple cantilever technique. Films originally in tension ({similar_to}5E8dyne/cm{sup 2}) were found to become compressive after absorbing 300kJ/cm{sup 3} of x rays. Both forms of damage responded well to annealing.Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and near-edge x-ray absorption measurementswere made to discern the structural differences between degraded andunexposed films. No significant structural changes were observed. Boronnitride films deposited at higher temperatures (600 {sup 0}C) provedto be much less susceptible to radiation damage. In a related development,films produced through the pyrolysis of borazine appeared to be completelyimmune to radiation damage as were silicon and silicon nitride membranes.FTIR spectra indicate that less hydrogen is present in the 600 {sup 0}Cchemical-vapor deposition (CVD) and the pyrolytic boron nitride filmsthan in the 400 {sup 0}C CVD films. As proposed by Johnson et al., hydrogenis implicated as an intermediary in the boron nitride damage mechanism.</TEXT></DOC>
