BERGSTROM</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Declining mid-March sales of U.S.-made cars arenot a sign of trouble but a return to balance in the market,industry analysts say.   Combined domestic car and light truck sales totaled 298,754during the March 11-20 sales period, down from 333,623 formid-March 1987 but up 0.7 percent on a daily basis, the automakersreported Wednesday.   ``I don't see this weakness in mid-March as a prediction ofgreater weakness throughout the year,'' said auto analyst ChrisCedergren.   The eight companies making autos in the United States sold189,245 cars in the period's eight sales days, down from 217,939 innine sales days in the comparable 1987 period. The daily sales rateslid 2.3 percent.   Sales of domestic-made light trucks totaled 109,509, a decreasefrom 115,684 in the year-ago period but still a 6.5 percentincrease in daily sales.   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily salesduring each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.   Domestic sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.4million for the mid-March period. That would indicate a declinefrom 1987's 7.1 million in domestic sales, although in the 30 daysbefore the March period sales ran at an 8.1 million annual pace.   ``It looks like sales are beginning to drop back down to a moreexpected level,'' said Cedergren, of J.D. Power andamp; Associates inWestlake Village, Calif.   Jeannette Garretty, an analyst at Bank of America in SanFrancisco, said sales surged earlier as some people responded tobuying incentives offered by the automakers and as some went aheadwith purchases put off after the October stock market crash.   ``Now it is going to start to settle down,'' she said.   Sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks for the year to date totaled2.4 million, up 16.4 percent on a daily basis from 2.1 million soldthrough the mid-March period in 1987.   Industry leader General Motors Corp. sold 92,173 domestic-madecars in the March 11-20 period, down from 105,438 in the 1987period. GM's daily sales rate fell by 1.7 percent.   Ford Motor Co. auto sales of 54,186 fell from 67,672 in theyear-earlier period, and were down 9.9 percent on a daily basis.   Chrysler car sales jumped to 30,801 in this year's eight-dayselling period from 31,699 in the nine-day period in 1987, up 9.3percent daily. Chrysler light truck sales jumped even more, to24,691 from 20,987 in the year-earlier period, a 32.4 percent leapin daily sales.   GM truck sales totaled 45,376 in the eight-day period comparedwith 43,515 a year earlier, with the daily sales rate rising by17.3 percent.   Ford light truck sales sagged to 36,812, from 49,164 in theyear-earlier period. The daily sales rate fell 15.8 percent.   Market shares of the Big Three automakers changed slightly froma year earlier, with GM capturing 48.7 percent, compared with 48.4percent; Ford dropping to 28.6 percent from 31.1 percent, andChrysler rising to 16.3 percent from 14.5 percent.   Aggressive incentives paid off for some Japanese companiesmaking cars in the United States. Honda's sales of 7,270represented a 9.8 percent increase in daily sales rate.   Volkswagen of America sold 1,034 U.S.-made cars, down from 1,330a year earlier, and down 12.5 percent on a daily basis.</TEXT></DOC>
