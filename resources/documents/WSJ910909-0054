Senate Intelligence Committee staffers have heldpreliminary talks, too, with Alan Fiers, a former CIA CentralAmerica task force chief who is cooperating in a separatecriminal probe of efforts to obstruct congressional inquiriesinto a secret White House network to arm Nicaraguanguerrillas in the mid-1980s.</LP><TEXT>   Preparations for the Senate hearings, scheduled to beginnext week, coincide with new charges against former CIAofficials by a grand jury overseen by Iran-Contra independentcounsel Lawrence Walsh. Clair George, who served under Mr.Gates as the CIA's director of operations in 1986, wasindicted Friday on perjury and obstruction charges. Courtpapers also reflect a continued interest by Mr. Walsh in therole played by Donald Gregg, a CIA veteran and contemporaryof Mr. George's who served as an adviser to then VicePresident George Bush.   Despite the new charges, the Bush administration signaledits desire to press ahead with the hearings and Mr. Gates'snomination. &quot;Bob Gates is the right nominee and the rightchoice to run the CIA,&quot; said White House Chief of Staff JohnSununu on NBC News's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; yesterday. &quot;The way theintelligence community operates with its compartmentalizationwill be rather clear in the hearings.&quot;   Mr. Allen's testimony is important in judging Mr. Gates'sresponse to his early warning that profits from covert armssales to Iran were being diverted to the Contras. In August1986, months before the scandal became public, the analystraised his concerns with a senior officer, and in Octobertook the issue directly to Mr. Gates, then the No. 2 man inthe agency. In the weeks following, Mr. Gates helped to seethat the analysis reached CIA Director William Casey and theWhite House, but he is certain to face questions fromsenators regarding the speed with which he reacted and hisevaluation of the evidence presented by Mr. Allen.   Now Mr. Bush's deputy national security adviser, Mr. Gateshas characterized Mr. Allen's warnings as &quot;very shaky stuff&quot;and an analytical judgment based on &quot;no concrete evidence.&quot;In response to written interrogatories from the Senateintelligence panel, Mr. Allen has been given an opportunityto explain his work, and though no final decision has beenmade, there is bipartisan support to hear the analyst fullyas a witness.   Mr. Fiers's value as a Senate witness owes less to hisearly knowledge of the diversion than the details he providesregarding the level of knowledge within the government of theContra supply project being run from the White House. Theoperation was closely held initially, but as air flightsincreased in 1986, his account alleges that intelligenceofficials knew more than previously acknowledged and withheldinformation from Congress.   The indictment against Mr. George includes charges that hedirected Mr. Fiers to avoid conveying information that would&quot;turn the spotlight&quot; on the supply network after a cargoplane was shot down in October 1986. A reference to theIlopango air field in neighboring El Salvador was strickenfrom prepared testimony to the Senate, and Mr. George isaccused of shielding the identity and activities of FelixRodriguez, a former intelligence operative who assisted inthe White House operation.   Mr. Rodriguez, who used the alias Max Gomez, often workedfrom Ilopango, and his role was most sensitive to Mr. Gregg,a close friend from their days together in the Vietnam War.Mr. Gregg, now U.S. ambassador to South Korea, has repeatedlydenied knowing of his friend's part in the Contra supplyoperation. But Friday's indictment alleges that Mr.Rodriguez's role was known to CIA officials who had regularcontact with Mr. Bush's former adviser.   Mr. George has vowed to fight the charges against him, andthe criminal proceedings now make it that much more difficultfor the Senate panel to question him on Mr. Gates'snomination. One option had been a narrowly writteninterrogatory focused on Mr. Gates's knowledge of the affair,but after Friday's indictment, Mr. George's attorney declinedany comment on these discussions.   A colorful, almost Runyonesqe figure, Mr. George spentmost of his career in the operations division but is a provenbureaucratic infighter who can alternately infuriate andschmooze lawmakers. None of the perjury charges stem from histestimony before House and Senate Iran-Contra committees in1987, for example, and in at least some instances, he soughtto use that forum to correct the record of alleged falsestatements with which he is charged now.   For example, one of the charges in the indictment is thatMr. George disguised that he had met in January 1986 withretired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a central figurein both the arms sales to Iran and the Contra supply network.Yet in fact, Mr. George acknowledged as much more than fouryears ago to Iran-Contra investigators. &quot;I met Secord,&quot; hesaid then, &quot;I didn't tell SSCI&quot; (the Senate Select Committeeon Intelligence).</TEXT></DOC>
