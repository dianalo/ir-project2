Harvey,M.D., doing business as Victoria Allergy and Asthma Clinic, and RobertE. Harvey, M.D. and Gullapali K. Rao, M.D., IndividualsThe Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consentorder from Robert E. Harvey, M.D., (``Harvey''), individually and doingbusiness as Victoria Allergy and Asthma Clinic (``Victoria Allergy''),and Gullapali K. Rao, M.D. (``Rao''). The Commission has placed the proposed consent order on the public recordfor sixty (60) days to obtain comments from interested persons. Commentsreceived during this period will become part of the public record. Aftersixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and anycomments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreementor make final the agreement's proposed order.<ITAG tagnum="81">The Complaint</ITAG>The complaint prepared for issuance by the Commission along with the proposedorder alleges that Victoria Allergy, Harvey, and Rao have conbined or conspiredwith physicians in the State of Texas who specialize in the diagnosis andtreatment of allergic disease (``allergists'') to restrict competitionfrom non-allergist physicians. The alleged purpose and effect of the conspiracywas to coerce and boycott two manufacturers of allergy testing systemsto induce these manufacturers to discontinue their sales of the testingsystems to non-allergist physicians.According to the complaint, both allergists and some physicians who arenot allergists compete in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic disease.The complaint asserts that certain diagnostic testing methods, known as<T3>in vitro </T3>allergy tests, have been developed that permit non-allergistphysicians to compete more easily with allergists. Prior to the developmentof <T3>in vitro </T3>allergy tests, the complaint alleges, allergists largelycompeted only among themselves; after the development of these tests, allergistsbegan to face substantial competition from non-allergist physicians.According to the complaint, Drs. Harvey and Rao sent letters to all ornearly all allergists in the State of Texas in April, 1984, urging themto ``join forces'' against the marketing of <T3>in vitro </T3>allergy tests to non-allergist physicians. In particular,the complaint alleges, their letters urged these allergists not to dealwith Pharmacia Diagnostics, a diversified manufacturer of medical diagnosticproducts, because that company had marketed its <T3>in vitro </T3>allergy tests to non-allergist physicians. The complaintalso alleges that Drs. Harvey and Rao wrote to allergists in the Stateof Texas again in April, 1985, urging them to take concerted action todeter another manufacturer of <T3>in vitro </T3>allergy tests, MAST Immunosystems, Inc., from marketingits products to non-allergist physicians. The complaint alleges that someallergists in Texas joined Drs. Harvey and Rao in attempting to coercePharmacia Diagnostics and MAST Immunosystems to stop selling allergy teststo non-allergist physicians.The complaint alleges that the actions of Dr. Harvey, Dr. Rao, and otherallergists has several anticompetitive effects. First, by limiting theability of non-allergists to obtain materials necessary to diagnose allergies,the conspiracy restricted the ability of patients to choose among a varietyof alternative health care providers on the basis of price, service, quality,and other factors. Second, the conspiracy limited the ability of non-allergistphysicians, hospitals, clinics, and ambulatory care centers to competewith allergists. Third, the conspiracy hindered the development of competitive,convenient, cost-effective and innovative forms of allergy testing.<ITAG tagnum="81">The Proposed Consent Order</ITAG>The proposed order is intended to eliminate the effects of the allegedboycotts. It prohibits Dr. Harvey and Dr. Rao from entering into, or participatingin any joint action with the purpose or effect of impeding the use of anyallergy testing product by any physician, clinic, hospital, ambulatorycare center, or other health care facility. The order specifically prohibitsDr. Harvey and Dr. Rao from engaging in any joint action to refuse to dealwith any manufacturer or distributor of any allergy testing products becausethat manufacturer or distributor markets its products to non-allergistphysicians. The order does not prohibit Dr. Harvey or Dr. Rao from enteringinto agreements with physicians with whom they practice in a partnership,or physicians they employ, or by whom they are employed.The order requires Drs. Harvey and Rao to send a copy of the Order andComplaint in this matter to every physician and health care facility towhom they had sent their letters concerning Pharmacia Diagnostics and MASTImmunosystems, Inc. Mailing of the Order and Complaint to the recipientsof the alleged solicitation to refuse to deal is expected to provide noticeto those physicians that collective action to restrict the ability of non-allergistcompetitors to compete may constitute a violation of law.The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposedorder. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of theagreement and proposed order or modify in any way their terms.<ITAG tagnum="6">Emily H.
