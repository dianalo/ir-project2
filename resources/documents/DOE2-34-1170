To usher in the turnof the trend in energy, a number of obstacles have to be overcome. Tothat effect, the project 'Turning trend in energy - II' has devised anenergy-political strategy. The basic idea underlying this energy conservationscenario is to reestablish municipal responsibility over energy supply,i.e. to raise the community to the rank of central political planninginstance for energy use to suit local needs and make the most of energyconsumed.
