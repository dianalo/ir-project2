Use of Fe-57 Moessbauer effect spectroscopy as a probeof the spin dynamics for inverse autocorrelation times between {approx_equal}10/sup 7/ Hz to {approx_equal} 10/sup 10/ Hz is emphasized. Particularattention is given to systems which exhibit local or long range magneticorder and whose Moessbauer spectra must therefore be described by morethan one autocorrelation (or dwell) time for fluctuations between differentallowed hyperfine field directions on a given site.</TEXT></DOC>
