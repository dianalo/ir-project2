Inc. $877,000 for 114 safety violations inconnection with a Richmond, Calif., refinery fire last spring inwhich three workers were severely burned.   ``The great tragedy of these injuries is that they wereavoidable,'' Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Tuesday inannouncing the findings of the department's Occupational Safety andHealth Administration, which inspected the refinery after theaccident.   The safety agency concluded that Chevron was aware that workersresponsible for assisting firefighters should have had protectiveequipment and clothing. It said individual refinery workers andunion officials have been requesting protective equipment forseveral years but the company saw no need for it.   ``The company failed to provide even this most fundamental basicequipment,'' Mrs. Dole said.   Jeff Krag, a Chevron spokesman at the refinery, said the companyhad not finished reviewing the proposed Labor Department fines but``on initial glance'' saw flaws in OSHA's analysis of the accident.He said the company would appeal the penalties.   The company has 15 days to contest the fines in administrativeproceedings before the department makes them final.   The safety agency determined that the April 10 fire began when apipe carrying highly pressurized hydrogen gas separated at a weld.The resulting fire and explosion weakened an adjacent reactor,which fell and engulfed four workers in flames.   Three who were wearing no fire-resistant clothing receivedsecond- and third-degree burns over as much as 70 percent of theirbodies from hot oil.   The fourth worker, a firefighter, escaped with minor first- andsecond-degree burns on his face because he wore fire-resistantclothing that covered the rest of his body, the dpartment said.   Five other workers suffered less serious injuries.</TEXT></DOC>
