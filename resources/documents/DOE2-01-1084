In order that active and passive neutronmethods may be studied, the composition of the formative zone of thefacility (whose configuration can be controlled operationally) includesa cyclically switched antimony-beryllium irradiator with a maximum /sup124/Sb source activity of about 4x10/sup 11/ Bq and a channel type detectingsystem with up to 44 SNM-18 /sup 3/He detectors arranged in a cylindricalparaffin moderator and up to 16 in peripheral segments, with replaceableliquid fillers. The fission neutron detection efficiency is 10-20%, dependingon the configuration of the formative zone. The facility is used forresearch on the possibility of non-destructive fuel assembly assay usingfull scale (except in length) assembly analogues whose /sup 235/U concentrationsand distributions can be varied. Particular attention was given to studyingthe facility's response function and the components from which it issynthesized. These include the intensity of induced fission of fissilenuclides and the efficiency of fission neutron detection. The resultsof experiments on the ESNART facility to analyse fresh WWER-440 and WWER-1000fuel assemblies are given. The reproducibility of the measurement resultswas 0.7%, which corresponds to detecting the removal of two or threefuel elements out of 312 for WWER-1000 assemblies and of one in 126 forWWER-440 assemblies. With maximum gamma source activity, some 40,000delayed neutrons from induced fission of /sup 235/U in WWER-1000 fuelassemblies were detected over 10 minutes of cyclical operation of thefacility. 9 refs, 4 figs, 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
