The law would be effective through next September.    The measure gave the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. emergency powers to arrange interstate sales of failed banks, and it allowed the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to prop up struggling thrifts through accounting transactions. Known as the Garn-St Germain Act, it was passed in 1982 and expired last Oct. 13.    A bill to renew the measure through Oct. 1, 1989, failed to win approval last year.    The Senate Banking Committee is considering a long-term extension of the powers. Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) opposes the measure.    During a two-hour closed meeting yesterday, the House committee's Democrats also agreed to hold more hearings on a bill to raise more funds for the ailing FSLIC. </TEXT></DOC>
