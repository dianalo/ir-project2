Stewart (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> JUS </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government succeeded in keeping arbitrager John A. Mulheren in jail despite a federal magistrate's order releasing him to a psychiatric hospital.    In a detention hearing in Manhattan federal court that began Friday and continued into Saturday night, government prosecutors fought tenaciously to keep Mr. Mulheren imprisoned, arguing that he posed a serious risk to witnesses in a federal investigation.    Mr. Mulheren has been in jail since Feb. 18, when he was arrested by police carrying a loaded rifle outside his Rumson, N.J., home. According to police reports, Mr. Mulheren told police he was en route to kill admitted insider trader Ivan F. Boesky and Michael Davidoff, Mr. Boesky's former head trader. Both men have implicated Mr. Mulheren in the insider-trading scandal and are likely to be witnesses against him, people familiar with the investigation have said.    Federal Magistrate Kathleen A. Roberts, who presided at the hearing, said Mr. Mulheren's case involves &quot;very troubling charges.&quot; But she agreed with Mr. Mulheren's attorneys that his conduct seemed &quot;highly aberrational&quot; and may have been influenced by his failure to take lithium to control his manic-depressive condition. The magistrate ordered that Mr. Mulheren be released to the Carrier Foundation, a prestigious psychiatric hospital in New Jersey, under conditions that would provide a &quot;virtually prison-like setting.&quot;    Robert Gage, the assistant U.S. attorney handling Mr. Mulheren's case, immediately appealed the ruling to federal Judge Pierre Leval, arguing that security at Carrier isn't adequate to protect potential witnesses from Mr. Mulheren. Mr. Gage sharply disagreed that the absence of lithium triggered Mr. Mulheren's actions, saying they were a &quot;calculated, rational attempt to try to murder&quot; Messrs. Boesky and Davidoff.    Judge Leval ruled that the government had &quot;amply carried its burden of showing dangerousness&quot; and agreed that security at Carrier is inadequate. He ordered that Mr. Mulheren be returned to Manhattan's federal prison until this morning, when his attorneys said they will again seek his release before another federal judge.    In making his arguments, Mr. Gage gave new details about the events that led to Mr. Mulheren's arrest. The prosecutor said Mr. Mulheren went to Mr. Davidoff's house on the morning of Feb. 18 after being told the night before by his attorney, Kenneth Bialkin, that the government's investigation had reached the point where Mr. Mulheren needed a criminal lawyer. Mr. Bialkin is a well-known specialist in securities law but isn't a criminal specialist.    According to Mr. Gage, Mr. Mulheren later told police, several of whom are friends of his, that he would kill Messrs. Boesky and Davidoff and that &quot;without Boesky and Davidoff the headhunt would be over.&quot; According to Mr. Gage, Mr. Mulheren said that he had lost faith in the justice system and would &quot;take care of things in his own way,&quot; that he was &quot;smart enough&quot; to fool doctors into believing that he was temporarily insane, and that, once released, he would again try to kill the two witnesses. &quot;This case is as severe a case of an attempt to obstruct justice as could possibly exist,&quot; Mr. Gage said.    Mr. Mulheren's attorney, Otto Obermiaer, argued that the whole episode was triggered by Mr. Mulheren's failure to take lithium and that given proper medical care Mr. Mulheren poses no risk to anyone. Magistrate Roberts, who heard nearly all the testimony regarding Mr. Mulheren's mental state in camera, seemed to agree that lithium was a factor.    Mr. Mulheren seemed calm and relaxed throughout the proceedings, registering disappointment only at the end, when Judge Leval stayed the magistrate's order. Earlier he joked and chatted with the many friends and relatives who packed the small courtroom, often sitting with his arm around his wife, Nancy. He said that while in federal prison he had been playing cards with other inmates, adding, &quot;with these guys, you don't want to win.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
