We have now completed thatadministrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Actof 1930 (``the Tariff Act''). <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Review </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS), as provided for in section 1201 et. seq. of the Omnibus Trade andCompetitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption on or after that date is now classified solelyaccording to the appropriate HTS item number(s). Imports covered by the review are shipments of unwrought titanium sponge,which is a porous, brittle metal which has a high strength-to-weight ratioand is highly ductile. It is an intermediate product used to produce titaniumingots, slabs, billets, plates, and sheets. During the review period, suchmerchandise was classifiable under item 629.1420 of the Tariff Scheduleof the United States Annotated. This merchandise is currently classifiableunder HTS item 8180.10.50. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenienceand Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers two manufacturers and their exporters of Japanese titaniumsponge to the United States and the period November 1, 1985 through October31, 1986. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received </ITAG>We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. Wereceived comments from the petitioner, RMI Company (``RMI''), and two respondents,Osaka Titanium Co., Ltd. (``Osaka'') and Toho Titanium Co., (Ltd.) (``Toho'').At the request of petitioner and respondents, we held a public hearingon September 20, 1988. <T3>Comment 1: </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department erred in usingthe date of the long-term contract between Toho and its U.S. customer asthe date of sale because the quantities to be purchased were not fixeduntil placement of the purchase order, and urges the Department to useas the date of sale the date of the purchase order. Petitioner bases itsargument on the existence of a cancellation clause in the contract, which,in petitioner's view, causes the contract to be an options contract (ratherthan a contract for sale) by which Toho only offered to sell up to a certainamount of the product at a set price.Petitioner additionally argues that, given these circumstances, the quantityfactor in the contract is not fixed and, therefore, the contract does notcontain all of the necessary elements to constitute a sale for dumpingpurposes. Toho maintains that the Department was correct in using the date of thecontract as the date of sale, because it was bound to sell at least theminimum quantity but no more than the maximum quantity established in thecontract. Toho contends that the contract sufficiently fixed quantity,and the Department should treat the minimum/maximum contract no differentlythan requirements contracts or contracts that establish a mechanism fordetermining price. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>As we stated in the preliminary results,in order to resolve date of sale issues, the Department is guided primarilyby the date when the essential terms of the sale, particularly quantityand price, are established, such that the parties have nothing left tonegotiate or to agree on. Shipments by Toho to the United States duringthe review period were made pursuant to a long-term contract that predatesthe review period. In our preliminary results, we concluded that the dateof sale for those shipments covered by the contract was the execution dateof the contract because the essential terms were set when the parties enteredinto the contract. Specifically, we found that Toho was committed to aprice, as well as a total volume, at the contract date.After carefully considering the extensive comments received on this issueand examining the terms of Toho's long-term contract, we have determinedthat the date of the contract is the date of sale only for the minimumquantity specified in the contract; for any quantity sold above the minimum,we used the date of the delivery instructions (i.e., the purchase orders)as the date of sale. This decision is based on the fact that, althoughthe contract provides for the sale of titanium sponge at a fixed pricefor each of the years covered by the contract (and thus the price termswere fixed as of the date of the contract), the quantity term was firmlyestablished only as to the minimum amount of titanium sponge to be soldunder the contract. The customer was obligated to purchase only the minimumquantity specified in the contract; any titanium sponge sold above theminimum, up to the maximum amount specified in the contract, was left tothe customer's discretion. Thus, with regard to the minimum quantity, theamount was established at the time of execution of the contract and therewas nothing left for the parties to negotiate or to agree on. On the executiondate of the contract, however, the customer had not yet agreed to purchaseany quantities above the minimum and the quantity actually purchased wasnot to be determined by factors outside the parties' control, such as marketforces. See <T3>Voss International Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>628 F.2d 1328 (CCPA 1980); <T3>Brass Sheet and Strip from France, </T3>52 FR 812 (1987); <T3>Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies from Japan, </T3>50 FR45447 (1985).Petitioner has placed much emphasis on the existence of a cancellationclause in the long-term contract at issue. The Department disagrees withPetitioner as to the significance of this clause, and indeed does not considerthe cancellation clause to be a factor in determining the date of salein this case. Under general contract law, a cancellation clause does nottransform a contract for sale into an options contract or otherwise affectthe validity of the contract. <T3>See </T3>1A A. Corbin, <T3>Corbin on Contracts </T3>S 164 (1963); 1 S. Williston, <T3>A Treatise on the Law of Contracts </T3>S 105 (3d ed. 1957). Indeed,under California law, which governs this particular contract, a contractcontaining a provision that the buyer has a unilateral right to terminateon notice is a valid contract for sale and not an options contract whenthe parties do not intend to create an option. <T3>Millgee Investment Co., Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Friedrich, </T3>254 Cal. App. 2d 802, 62 Cal. Rptr. 730 (1967). Inthis case, there is nothing to indicate that either party intended to enterinto any type of agreement other than an agreement for sale. Moreover,an options contract would require further action on the part of the buyerto exercise the option to buy; in this case, no such further action isrequired as to the minimum quantity. Thus, the contract is a valid contractfor sale.Contrary to Toho's assertions, the contract at issue in this case is unlikea requirements contract in which the absolute quantity is not known butthe quantity is ``fixed'' in the sense that all or some specified portionof what the customer ``requires'' must be purchased from the one supplier.Similarly, this case differs from those in which the price is not absolutelyset but is pegged to a publicly quoted price to be used within a specifiedtime frame. In cases involving both of those types of contracts, the Departmenthas recognized the date of execution of the contract as the date of salebecause, although the contract term at issue (i.e., price or quantity)was not firmly established in the contract, the contract provided a mechanismfor determining price or quantity that was outside of the parties' control.<T3>See Brass Sheet and Strip from France, </T3>52 FR 812 (1987); <T3>Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies from Japan, </T3>50 FR45447 (1985). In this case, however, the decision as to whether to orderany titanium sponge above the minimum was totally left to the customer'sdiscretion and, thus, was not determined by factors outside of the parties'control.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Petitioner argues that if the contract date is usedas date of sale for entries pursuant to the long-term contract, the priceestablished in the long-term contract should not be compared to home marketprices for ``spot'' sales because spot sales are not comparable to salesunder a long-term contract. Since home market sales thus provide an inadequatebasis for calculating foreign market value, the Department can and shoulduse constructed value as the basis of foreign market value.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Petitioner has not demonstrated that spotsales in the home market are out of the ordinary course of trade or notin usual commercial quantities. Therefore, we have no basis on which touse constructed value in the calculation of foreign market value. Althoughit might have been preferable to compare long-term contract sales in theUnited States to long-term contract sales in the home market, such a comparisonwas not possible in this instance.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Petitioner argues that Osaka's accounting system understatesmaterial loss when production is declining because (a) recycled materialsare produced in sufficient quantities to replace losses in materials, and(b) crude titanium sponge work-in-process inventories may be convertedto a final product at relatively little cost. Petitioner also argues thatOsaka's accounting system understates its magnesium material loss rates,understates utilization rates, understates costs, and overstates output,when production is declining. Further, petitioner argues that Osaka basedits utilization rates on production of crude titanium sponge before crushingand, as a result, has understated cost. Petitioner advocates certain adjustmentsto cost of production based on these concerns.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Osaka's reported costs accounted for allrecycled materials used in titanium sponge production. Petitioner's assumptionsregarding magnesium material loss rates do not include additions to rawmaterials associated with Osaka's subcontracting arrangements with a thirdparty regarding magnesium chloride.Contrary to petitioner's assertion, Osaka's accounting system does adjustfor differences between beginning work-in-process inventory and endingwork-in-process inventory; thus, it is clear that costs are not understatedduring a period of declining production. The respondent's accounting practicefollows generally accepted accounting principles, and the Department hasbased its cost of production on verified actual costs.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> Petitioner states that it cannot determine (1) whetherthe calculation of long-term financing expense matches the interest expensereported in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reports, (2) whether the calculationof titanium sponge fixed assets relative to consolidated fixed assets isaccurate, and (3) whether the selling expenses which Osaka reported asdirect expenses have been captured as movement and packing expenses andbeen fully deducted from foreign market value and United States price.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The MOF reports do not show a breakdownof long-term financing expenses relative to titanium sponge. During verification,we selected representative expenses to trace from production records ofMOF reports. We verified that the reported ratio of titanium sponge fixedassets to consolidated fixed assets was accurate. All movement and packingexpenses have been appropriately deducted from foreign market value andUnited States price.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> Osaka contends that the Department incorrectly allocatedresearch and development expenses over titanium sponge sold only to outsidethird parties. First, research and development expense is more directlyrelated to production activity than to sales activity, and thus shouldbe allocated over production quantity. If the allocation is done on thebasis of shipments from inventory, the allocation base should include alltitanium sponge, whether sold to third parties or used internally.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree that research and developmentexpenses should be allocated on the basis of production during the periodrather than sales during the period. Research and development expensesare treated as an element of selling, general and administrative expensesinOsaka's accounting records and, as such, are charged as an expense againstsales occurring in the corresponding period. Moreover, allocation of periodexpenses on the basis of production rather than sales would result in assigninga portion of those expenses to goods remaining in inventory. If those goodsare sold in the next period, the cost assigned to them in the current periodwill not be captured. We agree with Osaka, however, that the allocationbase should include not only the current period's sales of titanium sponge,but also the current period's internal consumption of titanium sponge inthe manufacture of titanium mill products. The Department has made thisrevision in the cost-of-production calculation for these final results.<T3>Comment 6:</T3> Osaka argues that the Department erred in includingselling, general and administrative expenses (SGandamp;A) related solelyto silicon production of its subsidiary with those expenses directly relatedto the titanium sponge production facility.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> In this review, we allocated SGandamp;A onthe basis of sales revenue, because we had no reliable cost of sales figurefor titanium sponge.Because all of Kyushu's (Osaka's silicon manufacturing subsidiary) salesare made through Osaka, revenue from silicon sales is included in Osaka'sunconsolidated revenues. There is no difference between sales revenue onthe Osaka corporate level and sales revenue on the Kyushu_included consolidatedbasis. For the reason that the allocation base is consolidated, it is appropriateand reasonable to allocate all consolidated SGandamp;A expenses.<T3>Comment 7: </T3>Osaka contends that the Department erred in refusingto offset long-term interest expense by the corresponding interest incomein the calculation of cost of production. It claims that the Departmentwas wrong to have considered long-term interest income insufficiently relatedto the business of producing and selling titanium sponge, because long-termdebt instruments are, in fact, available to finance daily operations.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Short-term interest income shown to berelated to the ordinary course of business is accepted as an offset toshort-term interest expense (<T3>See </T3>Final Results of Administrative Review, Titanium Sponge fromJapan, February 17, 1987, 52 FR 4799). Long-term instruments generatingincome are typically more in the nature of investments and are not relatedto the financing of daily business activity. Therefore, it is not appropriateto adjust the cost of production for long-term interest income, and wehave continued to deny Osaka's claim for such an adjustment.<T3>Comment 8: </T3>Osaka maintains that because the calculation of itsdumping margin for the preliminary results of this administrative reviewwas based on ranged data from its public response for certain shipmentinformation, the Department should correct such data to reflect the accurateverified information.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree, and have made the correctionfor the final results.<T3>Comment 9: </T3>Osaka maintains that the Department should issue atentative revocation with respect to Osaka. It is the Department's practiceto issue tentative revocations based only upon preliminary results of asecond annual review showing no margins or <T3>de minimis </T3>sales of less than fair value. Further, current informationindicates that Osaka is not likely to make sales at less than fair value.Petitioner contends that the Department correctly denied Osaka's requestfor a tentative revocation because Osaka has not changed its pricing practicing,but, rather, has demonstrated no less than fair value sales during thefirst and second review periods by manipulating its accounting data andby reducing per unit production costs through production for inventory.Petitioner also contends that the evidence suggests that if the older isrevoked with regard to Osaka, it is likely that Osaka will resume salesat less than fair value. The data for the two most recently completed fiscalyears show (1) below cost sales of titanium sponge by Osaka, (2) Japanesehome market prices for titanium sponge that are higher than U.S. prices,(3) a rising value for the yen relative to the U.S. dollar, and (4) substantialinventories of titanium sponge.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Osaka has met the requirements set forthin andSection; 353.54(b) of our regulations showing that it has made no lessthan fair value sales in the U.S. market for two years. The Departmentin its cost-of-production investigation did find below-cost sales for thelast two years, but these sales were negligible when compared to Osaka'stotal home market sales for these review periods. Osaka adjusted its pricesto compensate for any decline in the purchasing power of the dollar againstthe Japanese yen during this review period, and reduced its titanium spongeinventories substantially since the last review. Based on the foregoing,the Department has tentatively determined to revoke the order with respectto this firm. The Department will issue a final revocation only if satisfiedthat there is no likelihood that Osaka will resume sales at less than fairvalue.<T3>Comment 10: </T3>Toho claims that the Department failed to deduct indirectselling expenses from the home market price up to the amount of the indirectselling expenses incurred on U.S. exporter's sales price (ESP) sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree that an adjustment to foreignmarket value should be allowed for indirect selling expenses incurred inthe home market up to the amount of the indirect selling expenses incurredon its U.S. ESP sales. We have, therefore, revised our foreign market valuecalculation for the final results to include this adjustment.<T3>Comment 11: </T3>Toho argues that the Department incorrectly interpretedits revocation request as relating to the third administrative review ratherthan the second administrative review, and requests that the Departmentissue a tentative determination to revoke the antidumping duty order withrespect to Toho.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Toho's revocation request, dated March31, 1988, referenced only the third administrative review covering theperiod November 1, 1986 through October 31, 1987. Moreover, since dumpingmargins of greater than <T3>de minimis </T3>were found on Toho's sales during the current reviewperiod, Toho has not met the requirements for requesting revocation asset forth in our regulations, which state that a party requesting a revocationmust demonstrate that it made no sales at less than fair value for twoyears.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of the Review </ITAG>As a result of the comments received, and correction of clerical errors,we have revised our preliminary results, and we determine that the followingmargins exist for the period November 1, 1985 through October 31, 1986:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s30,10 </C>  <H1>Manufacturer/Exporter </H1><H1>Margin (Percent) </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Toho Titanium/Mitsui <D>0.83 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Osaka Titanium/Sumitomo <D>0 </D></ITAG></ITAG> Osaka has requested that we revoke the antidumping duty order with respectto that firm. As provided for in andSection;353.54(e) of the Commerce Regulations, Osakahas agreed in writing to an immediate suspension of liquidation and reinstatementof the order if circumstances develop which indicate that Japanese titaniumsponge exported to the United States by Osaka is being sold at less thanfair value. Osaka has had no sales at less than fair value for two years.Therefore, we tentatively determine to revoke the antidumping duty orderon Japanese titamium sponge with respect to Osaka. If this partial revocationis made final, it will apply to all unliquidated entries of this merchandiseproduced by Osaka and exported to the United States entered or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption, on or after October 31, 1987, the endof the subsequent administrative review period for Osaka. The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between UnitedStates price and foreign market value may vary from the percentage statedabove for Toho Titanium/Mitsui. The Department will issue appraisementinstructions directly to the Customs Service. Further, as provided for in section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, a cashdeposit of estimated antidumping duties shall be required on entries ofthis merchandise from Toho Titanium based on the above margin. Since thedumping margin for Osaka is zero, no cash deposit shall be required onentries of this merchandise from Osaka. For any further entries of this merchandise from a new exporter not coveredin this or the prior administrative review, whose first shipments occurredafter October 31, 1986, and who is unrelated to any reviewed firm or anypreviously reviewed firm, a cash deposit of 0.83 percent shall be required.These cash deposit requirements are effective for all shipments of Japanesetitanium sponge entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after the date of publication of this notice and shall remain in effectuntil publication of the final results of the next administrative review.This administrative review, tentative revocation in part, and notice arein accordance with sections 751 (a)(1) and (c) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C.1675 (a)(1), (c)) and andSection;andSection;353.53a and 353.54 of the CommerceRegulations (19 CFR 353.53a, 353.54). <ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
