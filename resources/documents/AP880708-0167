The three-day ``Jackson Action Rainbow Express'' from Chicago toAtlanta will make three stops for large pro-Jackson rallies alongthe way and will undoubtedly add to the thousands of Jacksonsupporters who already were expected to show up in Atlanta.   Many will have no official access to the convention, so thecampaign is planning to occupy them with a series of rallies andforums, with an eye toward consolidating a progressive coalitionJackson hopes to lead in the future.   Although Jackson is not setting up the bus tour as a caravan,vehicles are expected to join along the way, said spokeswoman PamSmith.   ``It's a way of involving people. This is a people campaign,''she said.   More than 1,100 of the Jackson troops in Atlanta will bedelegates, but others are going south to show support for therunnerup candidate.   And some in those ranks are not happy with the way theDemocratic picture is turning out for this election.   While Jackson, pledging to be a Democratic ticket team player,has said he wants no disruption of the convention, they may not beas muted on disagreements with the party platform or a possiblerejection of Jackson by Dukakis as a running mate.   Jackson ``has a very heavy burden as he tries to balance amongwhat the different constituencies expect of him,'' said EleanorHolmes Norton, a former Carter administration official now headingJackson's platform team.   Some want to see Jackson as vice president, others ``can'tconceive of him in any other role'' than presidential nominee,while still others are looking toward his leadership of a newprogressive coalition, Norton noted.   It is not known whether the disgruntled will adhere to whatJackson's delegate coordinator Joseph Gardner says are the ``thewatchwords for the convention ... discipline, detail and hope.''   Floor debate over Jackson platform proposals, will be``constructive, not destructive,'' he said.   Despite such reassurances, grumbling among some Jacksonsupporters is just beneath the surface.   At least one street demonstration not officially sanctioned bythe campaign is planned by Rep. Gus Savage, a longtime Jacksonfriend and ally.   Savage's staff declined to comment on the intent, butindications were the rally will call on Dukakis to choose Jacksonfor his running mate.   Walda Katz Fishman, a Washington supporter and sociologist atHoward University, is organizing a small group of people to travelto Atlanta. She said that in addition to attending Jackson campaignevents, she will join in protests by other progressive groups thatmight be more critical of the Democrats.   Many people ``thought Jackson was really saying something. Nowthey're kind of being told, `Well, all that was just for show,''she said.   On the vice presidential question, Jackson's own words haveinflamed supporters' passions as he has repeatedly touted hisqualifications for the post.   Ron Walters, a Howard University political scientist andconsultant to Jackson's campaign, said, ``Some people haveexpressed the sentiment they will not vote if Jackson is not on theticket.''   However, he said, ``there's some way to salvage that'' _ ifDukakis ``comes up with something important' like adopting some ofJackson's economic positions.   Many Jackson backers are disgruntled about theDukakis-controlled platform which Walters called ``exceedinglyvague.'' He said it will ``shock a lot of people ... who wanted tosee in the platform a substantial view of their own interest andconstituency.''   Jackson has filed a dozen minority planks and will decide whichones to take to a floor fight.   Among his most controversial proposals are a call for a no-firstuse nuclear policy, support for a Palestinian state, a militarybudget freeze and a tax hike on the wealthy and corporations.</TEXT></DOC>
