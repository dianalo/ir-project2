Two American nuns said it was the second time in five days thatsoldiers came to the San Salvador church, terrifying families whohad taken refuge there from fighting between troops and leftistrebels.   ``They kept accusing us of hiding weapons,'' said SisterCatherine Arata, 48, of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, ateaching order based in Maryland. ``They were shouting at us: `Whyare you here? Why don't you go back to the United States?'''   The nuns said the first raid Wednesday on the church made themrealize it was not a safe sanctuary.   On Thursday, six Jesuit priests were killed in a dormitory at auniversity. Right-wing death squads, involving men in militaryuniforms, have been accused of that massacre.   After Wednesday's raid, the nuns began trying to move therefugees out, but there were still 30 in the church when thesoldiers came back Sunday.   After that, the nuns were afraid of spending another night inthe church. But Sister Elena Jaramillo, 45, of the Sisters of St.Joseph in Orange County, Calif., said ``We don't want to leaveuntil the last refugee is out.''   She said she was frightened that the dawn-to-dusk curfew wouldtrap them in the church and she feared for her life.   An Associated Press correspondent went by the church just beforecurfew Sunday, and it was locked and shuttered. Nearby residentssaid the people inside had been taken away by Red Cross vehicles.   Both nuns are suffering from hepatitis and came to San Salvadorfrom the provinces for medical treatment. They were caught in thecity when the rebels launched their biggest offensive of the10-year-old war on Nov. 11.   Luis Cruz, coordinator of refugee services at the San Jacintoparish church, said security forces also have made raids there,searching people and demanding lists of refugees' names. He saidthat police on Thursday took away two young men who had soughtsanctuary in the church.   Some military officers and members of the right-wing governingparty have publicly accused Roman Catholic priests, Protestantministers and church workers helping El Salvador's poor of aidingthe guerrillas.   More than a dozen Lutheran church workers were deported lastweek after being picked up by security forces.   Sister Catherine said soldiers spent more than four hours in theChurch of San Roque on Sunday. She said they pounded on the floorsand walls, apparently looking for hiding places, searched theclinic and small library, and confiscated a children's book andseveral publications.   She reported one soldier told her, ``You people are trying toteach class divisions. Don't you know there is only one classhere?''   Sister Elena said another soldier demanded to know where theclinic's medicine came from.   ``I said, `It comes from the same place your uniforms comefrom,''' the gray-haired nun said. The United States has providedabout $3.5 billion in aid to El Salvador in the past decade.</TEXT></DOC>
