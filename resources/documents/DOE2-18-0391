The new model projects energy demand byusing a disaggregated, end-use analysis, rather than one primarily basedon assumed rates of population and GNP growth. The carbon cycle modelis more complete, and the expanded atmospheric model can be used to analyzehow various policy options affect both global warming and total globalozone. With these refinements, the Model of Warming Commitment can beused to compare the effects of technological changes with those of fiscal,tax, or trade-pricing policies on future greenhouse gas emissions, andthus better project the timing and extent of global warming and ozonedepletion.</TEXT></DOC>
