The cable will be the second to go into operation across theAtlantic Ocean, following one inaugurated in December by AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co., British Telecom Inc. and France Telecom.   US Sprint's partner in the new cable, called PTAT, is Britain'sCable and Wireless PLC. Both companies are likely to defray the costof the cable by bringing in other partners.   The two companies said that as part of a new alliance announcedThursday, to be named Global Fon, they will offer telephone creditcard billing to the United States or United Kingdom in the currencyof the user's choice and a service that will allow seven-digitcalling between specified locations in the two countries.   Sprint purchased its stake in the cable from the Washington-basedPrivate Transatlantic Telecommunications System. The acquisition,which is subject to approval by the Federal CommunicationsCommission, gives Sprint a 50 percent interest in PTAT along withCable and Wireless.   Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.   At a New York City news conference carried by closed-circuittelevision to Washington and three other U.S. cities, US SprintPresident William T. Esrey said the cable is expected to costbetween $450 million and $475 million when it is completed.   It will have 17,000 circuits capable of carrying 80,000 digitalvoice communications and will have more capacity than all theexisting trans-Atlantic cables combined, the companies said.   It will compete directly with the TAT-8 trans-Atlantic fibercable, built by ATandamp;T and its European partners.   Esrey said the PTAT cable can operate at half the cost of TAT-8,but he said that did not necessarily mean Global Fon rates would behalf those of its competitors.   Esrey said the deal would cause ``very little'' impact onSprint's balance sheet. Sprint, the third-largest U.S. long-distancecompany after ATandamp;T and MCI Communications Corp, had an operatingloss of $409 million in 1988.   Esrey said the cable would have a ``substantial amount ofbusiness'' right from the start as Sprint and Cable and Wirelessshift their existing customers to the new cable, which will carryboth business and residential traffic.   Esrey would not comment on the possible effect the new cablewould have on its competition other than to say, ``We are offering aquality of service and ... products that are not now available.''   Esrey said it was ``distinctly possible'' that Sprint would allowothers to buy into its half of the cable.   ``We have been eagerly approached by a number of people who wantsignificant capacity'' on PTAT, he said.   Gordon Owen, deputy chief executive of Cable and Wireless, saidhis company's Mercury Communications subsidiary will handle theBritish end of the PTAT traffic. Mercury currently carries 11percent of the U.S.-British phone traffic by satellite, and Cableand Wireless North America already operates in the United States.PTAT will have spurs to Ireland and Bermuda.   Owen said Global Fon also would be carried on a new trans-Pacificcable expected to be ready in 1990 that is partly owned by Cable andWireless and which will link the United States with Japan, Hong Kongand Singapore.   Sprint, a subsidiary of United Telecommunications Inc. ofWestwood, Kan., and GTE Corp., now provides voice service to 150countries and video to 24 countries, Esrey said, along with datatransmission to 90 countries.</TEXT></DOC>
