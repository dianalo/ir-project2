The authoritarian tribal chiefs who have long ruled the 10homelands are being replaced or challenged by younger men, who viewtheir territories as key partners in a united South Africa ratherthan isolated tribal reservations.   ``The youth see the homelands differently than their parents, andit is not attractive to them,'' said Gen. Bantu Holomisa, the33-year-old military ruler of Transkei. Transkei in 1976 was thefirst homeland to become independent from South Africa.   ``We have been given a raw deal (by South Africa), and we won'tsettle for that again,'' Holomisa said in a recent interview inUmtata, Transkei's capital.   No foreign governments recognize the homelands, including thefour that South Africa classifies as independent _ Transkei,Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei.   Anti-apartheid activists dismiss the homelands as theillegitimate offspring of apartheid, which denies South Africa'sblack majority a voice in national affairs.   The homelands have little industry, scarce arable land and areheavily dependent on South African financial aid. They are largelyignored both in South Africa and abroad, although they have morethan 13 million residents _ about half South Africa's blackpopulation.   Holomisa and other like-minded homeland leaders concede they lackleverage when they ask the South African government for a role innegotiating political change.   But their goal of a unified South Africa directly challenges thefoundation of the ethnic-based homeland system designed by HendrikVerwoerd, South Africa's prime minister from 1958 to 1966.   Verwoerd sought to make all black South Africans citizens of theremote homelands, granting them local autonomy while whitescontrolled the national economy and government.   A conservative, older generation of tribal chiefs acceptedself-government in the 1960s and 1970s, receiving financial benefitsand the support of South African security forces. In return, thechiefs have neither instigated nor tolerated anti-apartheid activism.   However, younger leaders see the territories only as an interimstep on the road to a black government in South Africa.   ``In our own territory, we have tried to ... promote our ownagenda and unequivocally to destroy the (apartheid) structure,''Enos Mabuza, the 49-year-old leader of the KaNgwane homeland,recently told the magazine Leadership.   ``Our objective is that (KaNgwane) should be part of SouthAfrica, if not now, then in the long term,'' he said.   Mabuza has risked the wrath of the South African government bymaintaining contacts with leaders of the outlawed African NationalCongress guerrilla movement, the largest organization fighting thegovernment. He describes the ANC as ``a key actor, perhaps the mostimportant actor'' among black political organizations.   He also has refused ``independence'' for tiny KaNgwane, nearSouth Africa's eastern border with Mozambique.   The South African government would like all 10 homelands tobecome independent as part of its policy of racial separation.Critics say the government wants to fragment the black populationand decrease its political clout.   Only four homelands have opted for independence, and none haschosen that route since Ciskei in 1981.   Several developments in the past year suggest growinganti-apartheid activism in the homelands and a general discontentwith the system.   _In KwaNdebele, voters in December overwhelmingly ousted all 16Parliament members up for election, including Chief Minister GeorgeMahlangu. The defeated incumbents supported independence plans forthe small patch of arid territory outside Pretoria that is home toabout 300,000 people.   _In Bophuthatswana, dissident army officers launched a coupattempt Feb. 10 against President Lucas Mangope, who has led thehomeland since it was declared independent in 1977.   The group that kidnapped Mangope was led by an anti-independencepolitician, Peter Metsing, who remains at large. South Africantroops rescued Mangope and restored him to power hours after he wascaptured.   _In Venda, a nominally independent homeland in the far north,students and workers staged a highly effective general strike inAugust to protest an alleged government cover-up of ritual murders.   _In KwaZulu, homeland leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkathapolitical organization is locked in a power struggle with the nowbanned United Democratic Front, a nationwide coalition ofanti-apartheid groups. More than 1,000 have died in black-on-blackfaction fighting around the cities of Pietermaritzburg and Durban inthe past two years.   Buthelezi, the best known homeland leader, is a critic ofapartheid and was an ANC member years ago. But many activists viewhim as too conservative due to his current condemnation of the ANCand his refusal to support confrontational tactics such as economicsanctions, consumer boycotts and strikes.   In Transkei, Holomisa says he does not pursue contact with theANC because it would invite economic punishment from the SouthAfrican government.   Nonetheless, he says ``there will never be genuine change withoutthe ANC'' and other major anti-apartheid groups.   Holomisa stresses that many of Transkei's most pressing problemsare economic, not political.   Located on the Indian Ocean coast, Transkei is a visuallyspectacular collection of rolling hills, winding rivers, andwaterfalls.   But 95 percent of the people live in impoverished ruralsettlements, and 80 percent are illiterate. Infant mortality ishigh, and life expectancy is low. Most men who have jobs workoutside the homeland and either have long daily commutes or are farfrom their families most of the year.   Because Transkei is not recognized internationally, it receivesno economic aid except from South Africa.   ``South Africa's racial policies have hurt us,'' said Holomisa.``But international sanctions also make us suffer. There are humanproblems here that can't be wished away by pretending we don'texist.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sun Jan. 15</NOTE></DOC>
