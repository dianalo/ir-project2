In some regions of the world, the reserve of oil and natural gasis nearly depleted. The supply of such fuels relies on shipment fromforeign countries, and may be vulnerable to political crisis, while coalsare still abundant and easily available. Therefore, the technology ofburning coal for energy, which seems rather old, has not lost its vitalityand is in fact developing fast. Because of industry development, especiallyin developing countries, more and more coal is burned each year. If coalis not burned properly, it may pollute the environment and affect theecological balance of the surrounding regions. Great attention has beenpaid to curb these issues, and significant progress has been achieved.Technology of desulfurization of flue gases, low nitrogen oxide coalburners, and also the technology of clean burning of coal by fluidized-bedcombustion have all been developed and commercialized. Further improvementsare under development. At the same time, new techniques have been usedin the measurements and diagnoses of coal combustion. These new techniquesfacilitate more efficient and cleaner burning of coal. Although coalcombustion is a very complicated physiochemical phenomenon, the use ofthe computer enables and pushes forward the theoretical analysis of coalcombustion. Besides, the mathematical modelling of the coal combustionprocess is also a fast progressing field of research and encouragingresults have been obtained by scientists throughout the world. This bookcompiles the papers presented in the conference on the subject of cleancool technology and fluidized-bed combustion.</TEXT></DOC>
