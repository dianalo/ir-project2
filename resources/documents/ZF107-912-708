(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Integrated Software Gets It Together It was first hailed as the PC user'sdream software.andP;  From the mid-1984 introduction of integrated packages likeLotus Development's Symphony, Ashton-Tate's Framework, and the low-endElectric Desk from Alpha Software, the possibilities for data sharing andeffortless switching among lword processing, spreadsheet, and databasemodules seemed endless.andP;  Now this was computing.andM;After the smoke cleared, however, users began to see not a dream but a dreamdeferred.andP;  Despite advertisements to the contrary, not one of the integratedpackages on the market was proving itself to be the one package that anyonewould ever need.andP;  In fact there was plenty you couldn't do with integratedsoftware packages that you did every day using standalone products.andM;Wherel was the seamless integration--the all-in-one look and feel that madean integrated package out of a multifunction product?andP;  Where were thepower-luser features that were supposed to matlch those found in standalonepackages?andP;  These uncertainties resulted in a sharp dive in expectations,lwhich sent vendors back to the drawing board to rethink their strategies.andM;Things have since changed in the integrated software market.andP;  If you thinkcurrent integrated packages are too shallow to deserve a good hard look,think again.andP;  True, at the high end of the market, the feature-starved poweruser is more likely to opt for Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect, or dBASE IV than fora high-end integrated product.andP;  But the under-$200 low-end products, thefocus of this review, are adding rich features like macros and font selectionto build a growing base of corporate users.andP;  In short, these products aresteaming ahead of the high end and are carving niches that are all their own.andM;Software Publishing's $159 PFS: First Choice (according to the marketresearch firm InfoCorp) sold 165,000 copies domestically in 1988--ahead ofthe $695 high-end market leader, Enable from Enable Software, by 70,000copies.andP;  In fact, Dataquest, another market-research organization, reportsthat only four standalone word processors sold more copies that year.andM;In this feature, PC Magazine evaluates seven low-end packages (in the $59.85to $199 range), including PFS:First Choice, Microsoft Corp.'s MicrosoftWorks, Tandy Corp.'s DeskMate, and Alpha Software Corp.'s Alpha Works.andM;BREADTH, NOT DEPTHandM;The low-end products' market starts with a first-time PC user looking for alittle bit of everything for home or small-business use--in short, lookingfor breadth, not depth.andP;  Spinnaker Software Corp.'s $69.95 Better WorkingEight-in-One fulfills these needs for many; so does Tandy's $99.95 DeskMate.andO;Another market is the K-12 school, where Microsoft and other vendors aredoing their part to woo teachers and school administrators away from theirApple IIs nd Claris's popular Appleworks integrated program--used by studentsas well as teachers.andM;Perhaps the fastest-growing segment, however, is corporations seeking toadopt a standrd product that will suit several users with vrying needs.andO;Here, a program like Microsoft Works or AlphaWorks generally leaves behindthe beginner-only realm.andP;  Corporate users generally need to share files withhigh-end standalone products, and the program's command structure must beidentical across platforms to ensure shorter training periods.andM;Also within this group fall the &quot;interrupt-driven&quot; middle managers who findthemselves switching frequently from one application to another.andP;  Graphs andtables must be embedded into documents.andP;  Mail-merging using a sorted listfrom the database is a common need; so is importing spreadsheet data into thedatabase for report generation.andM;Above the middle managers stands the executive who has chosen to automate,has often inherited an 8088 or 80286 PC from below, and wants a program thatwill offer plenty without demanding too much computer expertise.andM;An extension of the corporate market--one that's winning back respect forintegrated software--is the growing base of laptop and portable PC users.andO;The obvious trend in the hardware is toward less bulk with equalfunctionality.andP;  For a salesperson in the field, why not carry every softwareapplication on one 720K 3.5-inch disk?andM;Several companies have already begun to recognize this audience: buy aToshiba T1000 with a memory card, or a Mitsubishi 286-based laptop, andyou'll get a bundled copy of Microsoft Works.andM;And if you're planning to consider the Poqet PC--at 1 pound, the lightestmodel yet scheduled to ship--and an integrated package at the same time,here's a bit of encouraging news.andP;  Alpha Works will be one of about tenproducts to be sold on credit-card-size ROM cards available for the Poqet PC.andM;HOW WE CHOSE THEMandM;Generally speaking, even a package like Borland International's SideKick Plusmay qualify as a form of integrated software.andP;  It offers, after all, suchfeatures as a notepad, programmable phone dialer, and time planner--sharingdata through WordStar-like like cut-and-paste Ctrl-key combinations.andM;But for most of us, SideKick's benefits are considered ancillary to themore-tangible needs of integrated software buyers: a full-fledged wordprocessor, spreadsheet, and database.andP;  For this review, the packages had tolist for under $200 and include modules for at least the above threecapabilities.andM;Communications, graphics, and SideKick-like desktop tools were not requiredfor inclusion in the story--although it's a safe bet you'll want themeventually.andP;  A common user interface was a must; pressing F3 should notperform a different function in each of a program's modules.andP;  Also requiredwas a package's ability to share data among modules, at least to some degree.andM;One product due for release by the time this issue ships is Enable BP, ascaled-down version of Enable.andP;  Due to offer the standard three modules plusgraphics, communications, and utilities, Enable BP (for &quot;businessproductivity&quot;) aims to provide a growth path for new users toward EnableSoftware's high-end product.andP;  Easy upgrades and file compatibility betweenthe two packages are among the company's plans, as is a price structurecompetitive with those of Microsoft Works and AlphaWorks.andM;Several other packages did not meet with our criteria of price and makeup ofmodules.andP;  TeleWriter ($129) from Randamp;S Micro Services offers a word processingand communications combination, but no database or spreadsheet.andP;  Productswhose price exceeded our $200 limit included Indian Ridge Enterprises' PCView ($248.85 with the three required modules), Migent's $259 Ability Plus,Paperback Software's $249 VP-Planner Plus, and, of course, high-end programslike Symphony ($695), Framework III ($695), and Smartware II ($895).andM;Two popular programs met our criteria closely enough to merit inclusion insidebars.andP;  WordPerfect Executive, for example, boils down WordPerfect,WordPerfect Library, and Mathplan into one $249 package for the executive onthe road.andP;  The sum total when installed offers a word processor, spreadsheet(though no database), calendar, calculator, and phone list on one 3.5-inchdisk.andM;The other product, Qandamp;A, refuses to be pigeonholed into the integratedsoftware niche.andP;  Having coupled an admirable flatfile database with a wordprocessor, Symantec chose to stop there.andP;  The company reasoned that Lotus1-2-3 users would most likely remain 1-2-3 users, so why weigh the productdown with excess baggage?andM;Qandamp;A is hardly suffering from its lack of spreadsheet capability.andP;  The $349Version 3.0 has been drawing buyer attention since its release in March 1988,and an OS/2 version began shipping in October.andM;TESTING INTEGRATED SOFTWAREandM;Although word processing is by far the most heavily used application forintegrated software users--45 percent of the user's time, as opposed to 25percent spent in the spreadsheet or database modules--PC Magazine designed atest suite that would burden each module both alone and in conjunction withother modules.andP;  In addition, we rated each package's suitability-to-task, asubjective score of how well a product approaches the power of popularstandalone application programs.andM;For a system's database component, we created a database containing 250records of employees with addresses and salary information, then imported anASCII file in comma-delimited format.andP;  We subsequently performed sort, query,report, and output functions, taking note of any relational features ofpower-user capabilities such as searching on multiple fields.andM;After importing a .WKS-format worksheet file containing a sales breakdown byquarter per salesperson, we observed how well the spreadsheet portion of thepackage imported the included formulas.andP;  Once employee records were sorted onthe spreadsheet's BONUS field, we printed a list of employees who did notqualify for a bonus.andP;  To test the graphics module, we created a vertical bargraph depicting three months of sales totals from the spreadsheet.andM;The word processing tasks had us important, format (using a package's bestfonts, justification, boxes, and other features), and spell-check an ASCIIfile with a letter congratulating employees who earned bonuses; we alsoimported an ASCII-format table and the bar graph.andP;  Among other tasks, amail-merge test printed the congratulatory letter that was to be mailed toeach employee qualifying for a bonus.andM;To test a package's telecommunications module, when one was present, welogged onto MCI Mail and sent a copy of the first mail-merge letter.andP;  Anyfeatures for script languages, phone directories, and automatic redial werenoted for inclusion in the review or summary of features.andM;In addition, each package was evaluated for hwo well it perfomed underduress--namely, features for the user on the go, traveling with a laptop.andO;Could the package fit on one 720K 3.5-inch disk?andP;  Did it offer templates forcommonly used business formats or offer a predefined database for, say,client contacts?andP;  What desktop utilities did it offer?andP;  These and otherfeatures can make all the difference for a professional away from the office.andM;WHICH TO CHOOSE?andM;Ordinarily, selecting a software product involves determining what featuresyou need and how much power you can get for what you're willing to pay.andP;  Buttoo often, integrated software purchases are viewed in a more negativesense--the decision is based on which features you're willing to give up.andO;Perhaps both perspectives have their merits.andP;  Ultimately, your own needs, aswell as the direction you see yourself heading, may be the best determinant.andM;There is no easy choice.andP;  For instance, even the low-end market leader,PFS:First Choice, offers plenty of attractive features across its gamut ofmodules, including a consistent interface and smooth data sharing.andP;  Its easeof use, in fact, is often enough to convince the potential buyer.andP;  But ifyou're mostly interested in a first-rate integrated word processor orspreadsheet--with less demand on other modules--you may opt for a productwith greater strengths in these areas.andM;If the database must be top-flight, AlphaWorks' relational database seems anapparent choice.andP;  But what if you want the ability to export files toWindows-based programs like Microsoft Excel?andP;  Remember that the low end isnot without its compromises.andM;And if graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are your thing, keep in mind thatMicrosoft Works is currently the only low-end product that conforms to IBM'sSystems Application Architecture (SAA), which has already begun tostandardize IBM hardware and software solutions.andP;  Other products are sure tofollow suit in later versions.andM;No matter what your decision, you can at least feel confident that you'reselecting a product from a market that's currently booming.andP;  While the highend of the market waits to see what kind of threat it faces from OS/2 (whosemultitasking benefits may lure away some users), the low end faces onlyunimpeded grwoth.andM;Vendors have had to do plenty to restore the image of the integratedsoftware, once the laughingstock of the PC industry.andP;  These products willdemonstrate that the results are nothing to laugh at.andM;LOW-END INTEGRATED SOFTWARE:andM;SUITABILITY TO TASKandM;How great a price do you pay in features when you choose a low-end integratedpackage over standalone products?andP;  PC Magazine's suitability-to-task ratingsprovide one way to help you make that determination based on your own needs.andO;If you need a product that offers as much number-crunching capability as,say, Microsoft Excel or Lotus 1-2-3--but it needn't include word processingfeatures on the level of WordPerfect--these informed (though subjective)ratings should be part of your decision process.andP;  For a more complete pictureof what each product offers, compare this information with that contained inthe product reviews and features table.andM;The TasksandM;Each package is rated for its usefulness in six areas.andP;  The first five--wordprocessing, database, spreadsheet, graphics, and communications--compare theintegrated package's appropriate modules against the best the industry has tooffer.andP;  In the word processing category, the product must stack up againstleading low-cost standalones like Qandamp;A Write and PFS: Professional Write tomerit a score of 4.andP;  For spreadsheet capability, it should rival leadingproducts like Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Excel for a top score; for databasestrength, Qandamp;A and PFS: Professional File; for communications, Crosstalk andPC Talk; and for graphics, Harvard Graphics.andM;The sixth score rates how well the package performs tasks that require dataand functions from several modules working together.andP;  Tasks attempted forthis score are mail-merge, desktop publishing, financial reports, and &quot;TheTravelmate.&quot;andP;  The last of these tests the software's ability to fit on one3.5-inch diskette for laptop use and to accept data from major standaloneprograms.andM;The RatingsandM;0 = No such capabilities offered.andM;1 = Poorly suited overall.andM;2 = Somewhat capable.andM;3 = Well suited.andM;4 = Excellently suited; rivals the standalone products specified above.andM;AlphaWorksandM;It's true that PFS:First Choice enjoys the greatest market share in thelow-end integrated software market.andP;  But two other programs in our reviewgroup clearly stand out from the rest: AlphaWorks and Microsoft Works.andP;  Bothprograms offer consistently superior functionality.andP;  Both boast pull-downmenus, shortcut keys, and mouse support.andP;  The screens in Microsoft Works aremore highly stylized and have more contemporary graphic touches; AlphaWorksgives you greater control over the use of colors.andM;The real distinguishing features in these two products, however, are thedatabase and power of AlphaWorks and the word processor and on-line help inMicrosoft Works.andM;The database structure in AlphaWorks is relational rather than flat-file.andO;Thanks to this design, information from different databases can beautomatically scooped up and deposited in another database at the time ofdata entry.andM;In addition, records can have automatically incrementing fields, 64K memofields, and user-created pop-up menus.andP;  You can even draw lines on the recordform to highlight areas or make boxes.andP;  Search expressions can be built on a&quot;query-by-example&quot; template.andM;AlphaWorks has a host of other top-noth features: extensive macro facilities;support of EMS, extended memory, and a math coprocessor; the ability to sortdirectories and look into a file before loading it; a very large andwell-presented dictionary and thesaurus; and the ability to keep 29 filesopen at the same time.andM;The word processor in Microsoft Works lets you format text in just about anyway you can conceive.andP;  You can justify text; center it; use strikeover,italic, or bullet characters; and draw lines between sections or boxareas--all in full WYSIWYG glory.andP;  A preview mode lets you see printer fontsand graphs you've copied and scaled from the spreadsheet.andM;Other outstanding features in Microsoft works include an admirable system ofcontext-sensitive help, superb on-line tutorial lessons, bookmarks, theability to hide columns and to sort a worksheet on up to three columns, awide variety of graphs and charts, and the potential to keep eight windowsopen on the screen at once.andM;If your work centers mostly a database applications, you should definitelyconsider AlphaWorks.andP;  If word processing is the main focus of your work, thenMicrosoft Works may be the best package for you.andM;One other program in our group deserves an honorable mention: Better WorkingEight-in-One.andP;  It doesn't compare with our top two picks in depth offeatures, screen design, or integration.andP;  But it has the major applicationsand offers a host of desktop tools, including a world clock, calendar, phonedirectory, date book, label-maker, and outliner.andM;All of the program's functionality is delivered at the extremely low price of$59.95--almost 60 percent less than Microsoft Works and 70 percent less thanAlphaWorks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
