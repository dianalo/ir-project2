But while dire predictions may be warranted about thedecision's effect on First Amendment freedoms, the impact maybe limited by an important, continuing trend inconstitutional law: reliance on state constitutions.</LP><TEXT>   Last month, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that its ownstate constitution provides greater protection for religiousfreedom than does the First Amendment to the U.S.Constitution. As a result, the Minnesota court declined torequire the Amish community to comply with a state law thatthey almost surely would have had to obey under the reasoningof the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last spring.   This is just one illustration of one of the mostsignificant developments in modern constitutional law. Withincreasing frequency, state courts are deciding that theirstate constitutions afford greater protection to many civilliberties than the U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of thefederal Constitution. More than 500 state supreme courtdecisions have followed this trend, about three-fourths ofthem in the last decade.   This development first came to public attention in 1977,when the Harvard Law Review published a speech bythen-Supreme Court Justice William Brennan suggesting thatcivil-liberties lawyers might look to state constitutions,especially as the high court grows reluctant to giveexpansive readings to the U.S. Constitution.   Under this approach, subsequently validated by the SupremeCourt, the high court's interpretations of the U.S.Constitution are a floor, not a ceiling. State courts can'tprovide less protection for civil liberties than the U.S.Constitution guarantees, but they may provide more.   The Minnesota case shows how this approach works. Policeofficials gave traffic tickets to members of the Amishcommunity who refused to display &quot;slow-moving vehicle&quot;reflectors on the back of their horse-drawn buggies. TheAmish asked a state court to throw out the tickets. Theyargued that displaying the yellow, orange and red reflectortriangles would violate their religious beliefs, whichrequire them to remain separate from the modern world and toavoid &quot;worldly symbols.&quot;   In 1989, the Minnesota Supreme Court said enforcing thereflector law against the Amish violated the First Amendmentguarantee of &quot;free exercise&quot; of religion, which the U.S.Supreme Court had interpreted to mean that states should tryto accommodate religious practices.   Then, last April, in an opinion written by Justice AntoninScalia, the U.S. Supreme Court said states may enforce lawsthat are generally applicable to everyone -- without makingexceptions for religious groups. The justices upheld Oregon'scriminal ban on use of peyote in ceremonies of the NativeAmerican Church. Experts said this was a major change incourse for the high court, although Justice Scalia said hisruling was more limited than that.   Minnesota had appealed the Amish case to the U.S. SupremeCourt, and a few days after the peyote decision, the justicestold the Minnesota court to reconsider its Amish ruling.   When the Minnesota court took a new look at the case,however, the judges decided they didn't need the U.S.Constitution at all. Instead, they concluded that Article I,Section 16 of the Minnesota Constitution, adopted in 1858,provides &quot;a broad protection for religious freedom.&quot; Thereflector law violated the state constitutional rights of theAmish, the Minnesota court said. The state's safety concernscould be satisfied by the Amish using reflector tape and redlanterns, which the religious order said wouldn't violate itsbeliefs.   There is a poignancy to the use of the approach signaledby Justice Brennan in the Amish case. Justice Brennan, whoretired in July, wrote the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1963decision that was all but overruled by Justice Scalia's Aprilopinion.</TEXT></DOC>
