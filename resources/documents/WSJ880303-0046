Bearish news and rumors about U.S. supply levels pervaded energy markets. Traders were still shaken that two closely watched supply barometers -- statistics put out by the Energy Department and the American Petroleum Institute -- varied widely last week. With such confusing indicators, some traders with short positions bought back contracts and took profits.    Still depressing prices was the report Tuesday that Arabian Oil Co., largely owned by Japanese interests but 20% owned by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, has apparently sold at least some oil at below OPEC-imposed prices. The apparent sales conflict with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' claims of price and production restraint.    West Texas Intermediate crude oil for current delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which has tumbled 12 of the past 14 sessions, traded as much as 30 cents lower before closing at $15.67 a barrel, down five cents.    In Europe, North Sea Brent crude traded 30 cents lower from the previous day, at $13.95 a barrel.    Responding to the price weakness, several major U.S. oil companies yesterday and Tuesday lowered the price they would pay for West Texas Intermediate by 50 cents a barrel, to $15.50 a barrel.    Despite the fall in crude and in unleaded gasoline, heating-oil prices rose. Rumors of heating-oil tightness in New York harbor was one of the factors, said Eric T. Bolling, a Geldermann Inc. vice president at Nymex.    David T. Mizrahi, editor of MidEast Report, a New York-based newsletter, cautioned that traders shouldn't assume that the Arabian Oil news definitely means Saudi Arabia is relaxing its traditional stand against price discounting. Though Saudi Arabia and Kuwait had to approve the company's sales, the oil involved comes from the so-called neutral zone between the two Arab countries.    &quot;This oil has always been considered a separate entity from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,&quot; Mr. Mizrahi said.    Traders were also speculating about just how far crude prices have to drop before OPEC calls an emergency meeting. Such a meeting would immediately send prices up by at least $1 a barrel.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices slipped across the board amid signs that the two-month rally is losing a little of its steam. Fund managers, who had been buying heavily on a wave of long-term forecasts for rising prices, falling stockpiles and growing exports, are apparently taking a breather. &quot;The market might be settling back a little under its own weight,&quot; said Steve Freed, a grain analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. &quot;There has to be some more new news or there will be further liquidation.&quot; One major futures-trading company snapped up soybean-meal and soybean-oil contracts early in the day, but a rally failed to materialize because traders took the opportunity to sell. Corn prices fell despite rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying 1.4 million metric tons of U.S. corn to go along with the one million tons it bought last week. Soybean prices were weighed down by nervousness surrounding the impending South American bumper harvest.    PRECIOUS METALS: Gold, platinum and silver slipped slightly as a feeble attempt to rally prices higher failed for the second straight day. Gold on New York's Commodity Exchange fell 20 cents to $430.80 an ounce. A dashing of inflation expectations and weak oil prices are keeping prices lower. Analysts are taking some comfort in the fact that the traditional premium of platinum over gold has widened again after virtually disappearing in January, and say a minor rally is possible even though prices are in a downtrend.    COCOA: Prices slipped to life-of-contract lows as International Cocoa Organization talks in London failed to develop a solution to the oversupply problem for the third consecutive day. The March contract on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange hit a new low of $1,560 a metric ton, before ending at $1,563, down $35. One analyst said a major problem is that the organization appears to be short of money to buy cocoa for the buffer stock. Ivory Coast owes the buffer stock about $30 million, the analyst said, and the buffer-stock manager -- who buys cocoa to strengthen prices -- estimates he has only $7 million, which would buy only a few thousand tons at current prices. Among the organization's options, the analyst said, is to extend the effective life of the International Cocoa Agreement and to increase the buffer-stock limit 100,000 tons, to 350,000 tons, &quot;but they don't have the money.&quot; As for schemes to withhold cocoa from the market, the analyst said, &quot;they are divided because consuming countries want that cocoa stored in Western Europe while producers want to hold it themselves.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
