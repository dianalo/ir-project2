The Capital Investment Coordinating Board said it has approved 141 applications involving a total investment of $1.47 billion. up 77% from 1986. Under Indonesian law, all the applications were accomplished through joint-venture companies.    Of this year's total, $1 billion is for new investments and the remainder is for expansion of existing projects. The board's figures don't include investment in the important oil industry, which is handled by another agency. Lower oil prices have led to smaller oil-exploration budgets in recent years, increasing Indonesia's need to attract investment in other businesses.    The board's approval figures make 1987 the best year for attracting foreign interest since 1983, when approvals totaled $2.88 billion. From 1984 through 1986, the value of approvals declined annually.    Board officials said this year's rise reflected strong interest in export-oriented activities. Recent deregulation of the Indonesian economy has helped attract foreign investment, they said.    Some local business analysts expressed doubt that the investment picture was as bright as indicated by the 1987 approval statistics and said some of the projects probably won't proceed. But the board said it was optimistic that a majority of the approved investments will proceed as applied for in the next few years.    The figures were announced less than a week after the government unveiled a new package of economic reforms that relaxes some rules on foreign investment. </TEXT></DOC>
