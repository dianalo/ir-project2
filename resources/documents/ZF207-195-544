NOYCE IS TRYING to save the U.S.andP;  semiconductorindustry.andP;  For him, it's like rescuing his own child.andM;Noyce invented a practical way to make integrated circuits--those slivers ofsilicon that today pack several million transistors in a space the size of athumbtack.andP;  Noyce's invention triggered the microchip revolution, which hasbrought the world video games, talking teddy bears, supermarket checkoutscanners, and, of course, personal computers.andM;Noyce, at 61, hardly needs to be playing white knight.andP;  His career has beenillustrious.andP;  He has won the National Medal of Science and shaken the handsof American presidents.andP;  His contributions have earned him the unwaveringrespect and gratitude of an entire industry.andM;Noyce would rather be doing plenty of other things with his time, such asskiing, traveling, scuba diving, and helping new companies get started.andP;  Andyou can rule out money as the reason that he works 55 hours a week thesedays.andP;  His technological brilliance and business savvy have already earnedhim a fortune in excess of several hundred million dollars.andM;The outfit that Noyce heads is called Sematech, a consortium of 14semiconductor firms that are trying to figure out how to make chips betterand more cheaply than the Japanese do.andP;  The U.S.andP;  government is sponsoringSematech with $100 million a year.andM;Sematech aims to advance chip-manufacturing technology three generations inthe next five years.andP;  This ambitious plan could restore America's ailingchip-making business to worldwide competitiveness--and keep the nation fromlosing further ground to the Japanese.andM;Only a handful of people are qualified to run such an endeavor.andP;  Most whowere asked to head Sematech rejected the offer.andP;  The position went unfilledfor five months, and the consortium was beginning to falter.andP;  Last summer,Noyce stepped into the breach; he couldn't bear to watch the industry he hadstarted go belly-up.andM;In 1957 Noyce cofounded Fairchild Semiconductor, which spawned the companiesthat formed the high-tech cluster known as Silicon Valley.andP;  Then he went onto start Intel, which gave the world the microprocessor and the DRAMchip--and made PCs a reality.andP;  And he imprinted on Silicon Valley a cultureof egalitarianism and a frenetic work pace that have helped make the regionamong the most innovative in the world.andM;A Reluctant SaviorandM;It's an eerie experience to visit Sematech for the first time.andP;  Tool alongseveral miles of highway on the outskirts of Austin, Texas, make a left onMontopolis Drive, pass A-1 Mobile Homes on the right and the Trinity Churchon the left, and you catch a glimpse of the Sematech complex looming in theempty distance.andP;  It looks like some sort of giant processing plant--but notone that processes anything remotely conventional.andM;The sprawling Sematech facility comprises three connected sections.andP;  Acentral utility building in the front houses and isolates any machinery thatcould cause the plant to vibrate.andP;  Behind this building is a two-storyfabrication plant in which state-of-the-art equipment converts ultrapurecrystals of silicon into microscopic engines for the storing and manipulationof information.andP;  A row of eight bright blue stacks rises from this section.andO;According to Sematech, the air that comes out of these stacks is cleaner thanthe general atmosphere.andM;Noyce works out of a sparsely decorated office on the fifth floor ofSematech's administration building, the facility's third section.andP;  And, incharacteristically unpretentious style, he occupies one of a series ofpartitioned cubicles.andM;Noyce steps out of his office from a meeting that has run overtime.andP;  Hehurries over, smiles, gives a firm handshake, and apologizes profusely forthe delay.andP;  Then he excuses himself and runs to the can.andM;The electronics world holds Noyce in awe, regarding him as a genius.andO;Associates describe him as &quot;remarkable&quot; and &quot;very unusual.&quot;andP;  They say that hegrasps the most subtle points of a technical discussion instantly and thenruns ahead, inventing as he goes along.andM;But Noyce is more than a brilliant technologist.andP;  A renaissance man who hasindulged in madrigal singing, Noyce has catapulted to the top of all he hasever tried.andP;  He exudes warmth, intensity, and self-confidence; writer TomWolfe describes Noyce's ability to inspire admiration as a &quot;halo effect.&quot;andM;Noyce talks modestly, using &quot;we&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot; to describe hisaccomplishments.andP;  But he wells with pride as he ponders the mark theintegrated circuit is leaving on the world.andP;  &quot;I am always pleased,&quot; he sayshesitantly.andP;  &quot;I'm sort of amazed, whether it's the traffic light or theprinter or the carburetor on my car.andP;  I get an enormous kick out of it.&quot;andO;There's no doubt, he says, that the most important product of his inventionis the personal computer, which lets &quot;every person have some help with hismental processes, getting away from routine to do more creative stuff.&quot;andM;But Noyce's passion is the present.andP;  He discusses Sematech and how it istrying to make the U.S.andP;  semiconductor industry excel not only at designingchips but also at producing them.andP;  &quot;We're trying to make manufacturing arespectable activity for thinking people,&quot; he says.andM;Sematech is pitted against a formidable foe.andP;  Free of the restrictions ofWall Street, Japan's electronics giants have built huge, ultramodern plantsand have developed advanced manufacturing processes.andP;  As a result of suchlong-range investments, Japanese companies are building chips lessexpensively than U.S.andP;  companies are--and they're conquering chip marketsthat the United States once controlled.andM;An Iowa TinkererandM;Growing up, Noyce never dreamed he might be the future savior of an industryor the father of a new industrial revolution.andP;  &quot;I was going to be a teacher,probably,&quot; he recalls.andP;  &quot;I was not going to be a preacher, that much I knew.&quot;andO;Noyce's dad and two grandfathers were preachers.andM;Robert Noyce was born in Burlington, Iowa, on December 12, 1927, the third offour boys.andP;  Until Bob was 13, the Noyce clan lived in a series of tiny Iowacommunities before finally settling in Grinnell, a Protestant college town ofabout 7,000 people.andM;Always a tinkerer, young Noyce once outfitted his bicycle with an engine froma discarded gasoline-powered washing machine.andP;  He hooked a car battery andheadlamp to his bicycle and warmed his hands over the lamp during his earlymorning paper route.andP;  With his older brother, Gaylord, 13-year-old Bob builta hang glider from plans in Popular Science.andP;  After crashing it off the roofof the barn, the two finally got the craft airborne by tying it to the rearbumper of a neighbor's car.andP;  The glider rose 12 feet off the ground, and Bobgot his first taste of flying.andM;School was a breeze.andP;  By his senior year in high school, Bob was practicallyliving at the local college, taking first-year physics courses.andP;  He stayed atGrinnell, finding time to compete on the swim team and act in a local radiosoap opera while double-majoring in math and physics and making Phi BetaKappa when he graduated in 1949.andM;Noyce was introduced to the transistor during his final semesters atGrinnell.andP;  It would be years until the electronics world started taking thetransistor seriously.andP;  But he saw that the future belonged to this new breedof device.andP;  &quot;He just took to it,&quot; recalls Grant Gale of Grinnell's physicsdepartment.andM;Young Man Goes WestandM;In 1953, Noyce got his Ph.D.andP;  in physical electronics from the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology and married Elizabeth Bottomley, the costume directorfor a Tufts University musical he had performed in during the summer.andP;  Heturned down job offers from several prestigious companies to join the PhilcoCorporation, of Philadelphia, which was just getting involved in transistors.andO;&quot;IBM didn't need me,&quot; recalls Noyce.andP;  &quot;RCA didn't need me.andP;  ATandamp;T didn't needme.andP;  They had all sorts of people who knew what they were doing.&quot;andM;His big break came after three years at Philco.andP;  He got a call from WilliamShockley, the physicist who was to receive the Nobel Prize for heading theBell Labs team that invented the transistor.andP;  Shockley invited Noyce to comework for him at the laboratory he was setting up in Mountain View,California, to develop inexpensive transistors for the commercial market.andO;This was an offer no hot young solid-state physicist could turn down.andO;&quot;Shockley was the man to whom everybody else was looking for ideas,&quot; saysNoyce.andP;  Bob and Betty Noyce gathered their two young children and headedwest.andM;But there was a problem.andP;  Shockley, Noyce puts it kindly, &quot;was not wellsocialized.&quot;andP;  According to one source, the eminent physicist constantlywatched over the shoulders of Noyce and a handful of other young Ph.D.s,questioning everything they did and even submitting some of them to liedetector and psychological tests.andM;&quot;He didn't trust anyone's technical judgment,&quot; says Eugene Kleiner, one ofthe other Shockley researchers and now a prominent venture capitalist.andP;  Tofurther deflate morale, the lab seemed unable to bring a product to market.andM;Fed up, Kleiner and six other researchers decided to leave.andP;  In 1957 theylined up financing from Fairchild Camera andamp; Instrument to start FairchildSemiconductor, a transistor company--and they recruited Noyce to head it.andO;&quot;Bob had the best leadership qualities and personality,&quot; recalls Kleiner.andO;With $1.5 million in cash, the &quot;traitorous eight&quot; (Shockley's denunciation)began operating in a two-story concrete warehouse.andM;&quot;We set up the best semiconductor laboratory in the world at the time,&quot; saysNoyce.andP;  The founding talent represented the cream of the crop of America'syoung solid-state physicists and engineers.andP;  At 30, Noyce was one of thegroup's eldest members.andM;The Seminal InventionandM;By the end of 1958, Fairchild Semiconductor was selling transistors to majorelectronics companies.andP;  Replacing vacuum tubes with the compact devicesallowed engineers to shrink racks of equipment onto a few circuit boards.andO;Still, the first transistor-based computers were expensive monstrosities thatfew organizations could afford.andM;Noyce had a solution: fabricate the components of a circuit--the resistors,the capacitors, the transistors, and the interconnecting conductors--on asingle piece of silicon.andP;  He jotted down the concept in his notebook in 1959.andO;Signals would travel between components on the integrated circuit, or IC, viaconductive pathways deposited on the silicon in a thin film.andM;Six months earlier, Texas Instruments engineer Jack Kilby had come up with asimilar idea.andP;  But Kilby's proposal relied on a rat's nest of tiny goldwires, painstakingly attached by hand to each component on the chip.andP;  Noyce'smore practical interconnection scheme probably qualifies him as themicrochip's true inventor.andP;  (A ten-year patent fight between FairchildSemiconductor and Texas Instruments ended in compromise, with both Noyce andKilby getting patents for their respective portions of the IC.)andM;It was the IC--not the transistor--that ushered in the era of cheap, smallcomputers.andP;  &quot;From the beginning,&quot; says Noyce, &quot;I thought the main use for theIC was in computers.&quot;andP;  But in the early sixties, nobody, not even Noyce, hadthe foggiest idea how far the IC would go.andP;  &quot;You could see getting the costof the logic of a computer from the millions of dollars to the hundreds ofthousands of dollars.andP;  But to see PCs at a thousand dollars--no, we weren'tthinking that far out.&quot;andM;ICs caught on slowly.andP;  Fairchild Semiconductor's first chip, announced in1960, was a circuit called a flip-flop--an electronic toggle switch,basically.andP;  It contained four transistors and two resistors and sold for$120.andP;  At that exorbitant price, early demand for ICs came mostly from themilitary and from the fledgling space program.andP;  As chip-making technologyevolved, prices fell.andP;  By 1964, 100-transistor chips were selling for $50,and the devices started to show up in commercial computers.andM;Fairchild was a beacon for the best and brightest people entering thesemiconductor industry.andP;  But with a flood of venture capital and nothing tokeep this talent on the hook, the company became a revolving door.andP;  Between1960 and 1968, at least eight firms--including Signetics, Intersil, andGeneral Micro-Electronics--were spun off from Fairchild Semiconductor.andM;&quot;We were out hiring bright, aggressive, young people,&quot; says Noyce.andP;  &quot;Theysaid, 'If he can do it, why can't I?'andP;  So we spawned a lot of companies.&quot;andO;Eventually, Fairchild Semiconductor crumbled from this exodus.andP;  It was soldfirst to the multinational firm Schlumberger in 1979 and then--for a paltry$122 million--to rival National Semiconductor in 1987.andM;Spreading the CultureandM;Fairchild Semiconductor's influence outlasted its business glory.andP;  Thecompany had served as Silicon Valley's vocational training school.andP;  It washere that dozens of the industry's future millionaires and chief executiveslearned the business, made their mistakes, and left to strike out on theirown.andM;As they left, they took with them the Fairchild corporate culture and spreadit like seeds in a fertile valley.andP;  The culture was Noyce's second greatinnovation at Fairchild Semiconductor, after the integrated circuit.andP;  And itbecame the key ingredient for the success of future generations of SiliconValley high-technology firms.andM;The culture was based on applying egalitarian principles to a corporation.andO;&quot;There was never any question of imposed authority,&quot; says Noyce.andP;  &quot;It wasgranted authority.andP;  Empowering from below, not from the top.&quot;andP;  People werepretty much equal--Fairchild Semiconductor executives had no reserved parkingspaces, no big fancy offices, no private dining room.andM;Ideas, not rank, held the greatest value.andP;  A junior engineer who figured outa better way to make ICs could rise quickly in the freewheeling organization.andO;All he had to do was speak up in a meeting or walk into Noyce's office.andP;  Andhe found that he had as much responsibility--and work--thrust upon him as hecould handle.andM;But there was trouble in high-tech paradise.andP;  The loss of talent to otherfledgling chip companies hurt.andP;  Moreover, Fairchild Camera andamp; Instrument wassiphoning off profits from its chip-making subsidiary to subsidize otherefforts.andP;  Noyce was promoted to a corporate slot.andP;  It seemed more and moreclear, he says, that &quot;the board was running the company for its own benefit.&quot;andM;Weary of administrative work, Noyce left Fairchild in 1968 to start anotherchip company.andP;  &quot;I saw an opportunity,&quot; he says, &quot;to test out whether thefirst time was luck or brains.&quot;andP;  Joining Noyce in the new venture were GordonMoore, a Fairchild Semiconductor cofounder, and Andy Grove, a FairchildSemiconductor expert on the chip-making process.andP;  They called their ventureIntel.andM;Noyce jokes that it took all of five minutes to line up financing.andP;  With noformal business plan, just some rough ideas about mass-producing microchips,the founders went to Arthur Rock, who had arranged the financing forFairchild Semiconductor 11 years earlier and who was now a leading venturecapitalist.andP;  Noyce and Moore each contributed $245,000.andP;  Rock was able toquickly raise $2.5 million and tossed in $10,000 of his own.andP;  &quot;He [Noyce]started Fairchild,&quot; the venture capitalist explains.andP;  &quot;I didn't see why hecouldn't do it again.&quot;andM;&quot;I felt very excited,&quot; says Noyce.andP;  &quot;We were going to do it our way,&quot;unfettered by a stifling corporate parent.andP;  Intel took shape under amanagement troika: Noyce as chief executive, Moore as executive vicepresident, and Grove as director of operations.andP;  The new company would targetcomputer memory, an area in which Fairchild Semiconductor had shown nointerest.andM;Computers of the time used core memories.andP;  Information resided in arrays oftiny, doughnut-shaped pieces of ceramic--cores--with little wires strungthrough them to create and sense a magnetic one or zero.andP;  It was just amatter of time, Noyce and Moore figured, before semiconductors could replacethese large and expensive devices.andM;Says Noyce: &quot;Memory seemed to be the heroin of the computer business.andP;  If youcould get people hooked on semiconductor memories, there would be anabsolutely explosive market.andP;  Our entire strategy was to get far enough outin front of that parade so that when the market exploded, Intel would too.&quot;andM;Within two years Intel introduced a 1,000-bit RAM chip.andP;  &quot;It was the firstsemiconductor memory that was priced about the same as core memory,&quot; saysNoyce.andP;  Intel became known as a technology powerhouse that was wiping outcore memories.andP;  The company grew rapidly.andP;  By 1973 it had sales of $66million and more than 2,500 employees; the following year, sales doubled.andM;Then Intel made a fateful change in direction.andP;  A Japanese company calledBusicom contracted with Intel to make a set of electronic components for anew calculator.andP;  The conventional approach was to build a set ofpreconfigured calculator chips and wire them together on a circuit board.andP;  Ayoung Intel engineer named Ted Hoff figured out that it would be cheaper tofabricate a generic central processing unit on a single chip and to store acalculator program in read-only memory.andP;  The microprocessor was born.andM;Intel's marketing people were divided over the new computer-on-a-chip.andO;Naysayers insisted that the market was too small for the 4-bit device.andP;  Afterall, the minicomputer industry was selling only 20,000 machines per year;whatever share Intel got of that would hardly be worth the hassle.andM;Advocate of the MicroandM;But Noyce believed otherwise.andP;  &quot;I was delighted,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;We jumped on itand pushed as hard as we could.andP;  People were then designing custom circuits.andO;We used to go around and say, 'Couldn't you do what that does with acomputer?'andP;  They'd say, 'Yes, but it's too expensive.'andP;  So we'd say, 'What ifthe computer cost a dollar?' They'd say that was impossible.andP;  These days, ofcourse, things like that cost 50 cents.&quot;andM;Inventor Hoff credits Noyce with nurturing the invention despite marketuncertainties.andP;  &quot;A less bold chief executive might have been much morereluctant to pursue it,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Bob recognized that what we were doingwith the microprocessor was making a kind of universal VLSI [very large scaleintegration] component,&quot; an inexpensive part that would, given the rightsoftware, behave just like a costlier custom integrated circuit.andM;Although more farsighted than most of his contemporaries, Noyce did notanticipate the microprocessor's greatest spin-off: the PC.andP;  &quot;That was one ofour greatest mistakes,&quot; he admits.andP;  In fact, Intel would turn down manyopportunities to start making its own computers in the years leading up toIBM's 1981 PC introduction.andP;  Noyce and others at Intel, he says, thought thefirst microcomputers were &quot;hobbyist things that would not have a widemarket.&quot;andM;Intel got into the PC market through the side door, wangling its 8088microprocessor--a commercially unpopular chip that was losing market battlesto competing products from Motorola, Zilog, and others--into the IBM PC.andO;This brilliant stroke eventually put Intel into a position that's about asclose to a monopoly as you can get in the semiconductor business--Intelbecame the supplier of microprocessors for IBM PCs and their clones.andM;As Intel's sales topped $650 million, Noyce withdrew from its day-to-dayaffairs; running a huge company is not what he enjoys most.andP;  In 1979 hestepped down to become vice chairman, and he finally had time to devote toother things.andM;Semiconductor SpokesmanandM;During the 1980s, Noyce has become the chip industry's foremost spokesman.andO;He is credited with swaying Congress to vote for industry tax credits forresearch and development and helping to prompt the Reagan administration'smeasures against Japan's restrictive trade practices.andP;  He has headed industrycommissions, sat on the boards of a half-dozen companies, and served on theBoard of Regents of the University of California.andM;And he has spent more time with his second wife, Ann, a former Intelpersonnel director whom he married in 1975.andP;  They ski, travel, and otherwiseenjoy some of the wealth he has amassed.andM;Noyce was involved with Sematech since its beginning, long before Congressawarded funding to the consortium.andP;  Once Sematech had its financing lined up,he cochaired the search committee for a chief executive.andM;&quot;It was frustrating,&quot; recalls Noyce.andP;  &quot;Every time we offered the job tosomebody, they got a huge promotion and their company screamed that theycouldn't possibly get along without them.&quot;andP;  With a vacuum at the top,Sematech stalled.andP;  The consortium seemed in danger of losing its credibilitywithin Congress, on which it relied for half its funding.andM;With the crisis apparent, Noyce took the helm.andP;  The semiconductor businesswas surprised and overjoyed.andP;  &quot;I didn't think we had a chance of convincinghim,&quot; says Charlie Sporck, chief executive of National Semiconductor.andM;Sematech has its work cut out for it.andP;  Its first goal is to perfect thetechnology for manufacturing the 4-megabit DRAM chip, which the Japanese havealready done.andM;Still, the challenge clearly exhilarates Noyce.andP;  &quot;The stakes are very high,&quot;he says.andP;  &quot;The cost of failure is very high.andP;  And that's fun.&quot;andM;Spoken like a true father.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
