Also under the plan, all federal workers will receive a 3.6percent cost-of-living pay increase.   The order, signed by Bush on Tuesday at the presidential retreatat Camp David, Md., follows his signature earlier this month on thepay raise and ethics bill.   The measure will raise top government salaries by up to 35percent over the next 13 months, with House salaries jumping fromthe current $89,500 to $96,600 in 1990 and more than $120,000 in1991, plus a cost-of-living adjustment.   But by then the 435 members of the House will be barred fromaccepting honoraria, generally fees for making speeches.   Senate salaries would climb in 1990 from $89,500 to $98,400. Butsenators balked at giving up their honoraria. The new law would notbar speaking fees for senators, but they also would not get the bigjump in salaries in 1991 that the House gets.   Senators could keep $26,900 in honoraria compared to $35,800presently.   Federal judges and top executive branch officials also would getan immediate 4.1 percent raise and 3.6 percent, compounded on that,on Jan. 1, 1990, as a catch-up for two years without acost-of-living adjustment.   House employees and other top federal executive and judicialofficials also would be barred from accepting speech fees beginningin 1991. Currently, House members are limited to earning speechfees equivalent to 30 percent of their salary. Senators can make upto 40 percent, but that will fall with their pay increase toslightly more than 27 percent.   Under the pay package, top-level members of the executiveservice level, who now earn a maximum of $99,500, would earn up to$107,300 under the legislation and the executive order signed byBush.</TEXT></DOC>
