They feel quite willing to investigateand test promising coals in order to provide the plants with the compatible,consistent fuels they need. The key element is that the fuel offers aneconomic advantage in terms of the cost of electricity and can be workedinto the compatibility ranges required. Clearly, the world markets dooffer some interesting prospects. EFC currently has taken shipments fromColumbia and Canada in addition to new domestic sources, most recentlyAlabama coals. Operation of diversified delivery systems is a positiveadvantage to EFC and Florida Power Corporation in that there is a degreeof competition between river, rail, truck, and ocean delivery modes.This also gives them a supply of coal in the event of strikes, or potentialnatural disasters. Purchasing of spot coals has been an effective wayto introduce some additional quality coals to Crystal River's plantsand decrease overall costs. The benefits of spot coals and other high-qualityfuels at Florida Power's Crystal River plants are quite apparent. Units4 and 5 at Crystal River each currently produce approximately 100 MWover their initial design ratings. This was accomplished at efficienciesin the range of 0.5% better than design. In addition, these units bothplaced in the nation's top ten most efficient units. Collectively, Units1, 2, 4, and 5 produce the cheapest coal-generated cost per megawattelectricity among the major utilities in Florida.</TEXT></DOC>
