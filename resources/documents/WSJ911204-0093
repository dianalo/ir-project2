Dragonair, a regional carrier 35%-owned by Cathay PacificAirways and that airline's parent, Swire Pacific Ltd., waspursued for months by both Airbus and Boeing Co. to buy newplanes. But the carrier reportedly chose to lease insteadbecause there are excess planes on the world market, many ofthem in the hands of big leasing firms which are offeringfavorable terms. Operating leases, as opposed to capital orfinancial leases, are like rentals, with the lease liabilitykept off the airline's balance sheet.</LP><TEXT>   People familiar with the deal said the five-year-oldairline intends to take five Airbus A-320s with V2500 enginesfrom International Aero Engines AG on firm lease, fordeliveries between January and October 1993. Dragonair alsois expected to take options to lease two other A-320s, one in1994 and one in 1995, and to take three lease options for alarger version of the plane, the A-321, for delivery in late1995.   ILFC, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., is theaircraft-leasing unit of insurer American International GroupInc.   Airbus, Dragonair and ILFC all declined to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
