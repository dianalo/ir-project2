This paper shows that, onthe contrary, a significant proportion of highflows results from rainand rain-on-snow. Highflows are divided and analysed according to thegenerating process. Five parameters are estimated and used to characterizeboth snowmelt- and rainfall-generated highflows: mean number of eventsper year; mean date of highflows; mean specific excess discharge; andmean duration of event. The spatial variability of these parameters wasdescribed by a first-order trend surface, and the results are discussedin the context of practical applications. 23 refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
