The 24-hour transport ban, set to begin at 12:01 a.m. Monday, isthe first scheduled by the rebels this year. The announcement, madeon the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos, said the action waspart of the guerrilla campaign against legislative and municipalelections scheduled for March 20.   The traffic bans have been effective in the past, especially inthe war-torn east. Motorists stay off the roads, fearing reprisalby the guerrillas.   Also Friday, the armed forces said five guerrillas and twosoldiers died in combat near the town of La Laguna, 55 miles northof the capital. Six government soldiers were wounded, they said.   Radio Venceremos claimed guerrilla forces inflicted 23casualties on government troops in Thursday's clash at La Laguna.It did not distinguish between dead and wounded and did not reportrebel losses.   In another attack, rebels assaulted the local Civil Defenseheadquarters, the mayor's office and the telephone office in SanJorge before dawn Friday, according to sources in the town 95 milessoutheast of San Salvador.   The sources, reached by telephone, said five Civil Defensemilitiamen were killed and two wounded. They had no information onguerrilla casualties.   The guerrillas caused extensive damage, according to thesources, who spoke on condition of anoymity.   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front havepursued a steady campaign of economic sabotage as part of their8-year-old war against the U.S.-backed government.   In addition to the regular declaration of traffic bans, thecampaign includes the blowing up of utility poles, attacks on powerstations and raids on farms and warehouses containing coffee,cotton and sugar _ the country's main export crops.   There were seven guerrilla-imposed transport strikes last year.Three violators of the strike were killed, about 30 were woundedand 160 vehicles were destroyed or damaged.   The insurgents on Wednesday carried out their biggest attack ofthe year, assaulting the base of the 6th infantry brigade and acotton cooperative in Usulutan, 70 miles east of the capital.   The rebel radio said the assault marked the beginning of acampaign designated ``armed struggle is the alternative to the newelectoral farce.''   Leftist parties have not participated in elections held duringthe war, saying that their candidates' safety could not beguaranteed.</TEXT></DOC>
