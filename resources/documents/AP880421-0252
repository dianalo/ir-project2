One year after her only child's death despite three livertransplants, Ms. DeSillers still is fighting. But public sentimentis no longer on her side, and her battle has moved intoPennsylvania's civil courts and attracted the attention of Floridalegal authorities.   ``I sit here with pictures all over the walls of my son. I sithere and I've lost him and I'm fighting for other people's kids andI'm being criticized,'' Ms. DeSillers said in a telephone interviewfrom Miami. ``To have people criticize me without knowing all thefacts, it's very painful.''   With the first anniversary of Ronnie DeSillers' death on Friday,falling coincidentally within National Organ and Tissue DonorAwareness Week, she said it hurts even more.   ``April 29th is going to be a year and it hasn't gotten anyeasier for me,'' she said. ``When I see kids playing, I get veryemotional. Everything brings back memories. One thing I keephearing over and over is Ronnie saying, `Mommy, I love you with allmy heart.'''   The 32-year-old former public relations consultant, who isdivorced from Ronnie's father, has withheld $261,189 owedChildren's Hospital of Pittsburgh, the world's leading livertransplant center. She alleges her son's third transplanted liverwas defective and that a potential fourth liver was turned down theday he died.   The hospital, which stands by its care of the boy, is suing Ms.DeSillers for the money.   ``His treatment was beyond criticism. We still don't succeed inall cases, although we do in the vast majority,'' said Dr. ThomasE. Starzl, director of transplant surgery at Children's and itsaffiliate, Presbyterian-University Hospital. ``We can't match theanguish a bereaved mother would have. But there's a very real pallof sadness that settles over us'' when a patient dies. Thecontroversy surrounding Ronnie's case ``only amplifies the scar''and ``cheapens'' the boy's memory, Starzl said.   Hoping to spur a federal investigation of Children's Hospital,Ms. DeSillers last month released a series of internal memos inwhich anesthesiologists criticized the liver transplant program.   The memos complained of poor communication among doctors,inadequate review of failed cases and general confusion. One memocited a case in which two livers were ``switched about like peasunder shells.'' A member of Pittsburgh's transplant oversightcommittee, an advisory group of two general physicians and sixcivic leaders, later explained the livers were swapped for medicalreasons and that both operations succeeded.   In Florida, meanwhile, officials are investigating the way Ms.DeSillers handled the hundreds of thousands of dollars Ronniereceived from countless Americans, including President Reagan, afund that provided the initial $163,113 payment to the hospital.   A state audit this year put the total amount Ms. DeSillersdeposited in seven accounts at two Florida banks at $980,310, afigure Ms. DeSillers says is far too high.   The money poured in after $4,000 collected by Ronnie'sclassmates was reported stolen in February 1987, a burglary stillunder investigation by Fort Lauderdale police.   Even after arriving at Children's with her increasingly ill son,Ms. DeSillers championed his cause like few parents before. Ontelevision shows and in frequent calls to reporters, she alsostressed the need for organ donation and spoke out on behalf ofothers awaiting transplants.   By the time Ronnie died, the single bank account in his name hadaccumulated $509,913, according to Fred Kerstein, chief of theeconomic crimes division in the Office of the State Attorney inMiami. As of mid-February, the balance was $239,288, he said.   Those assets were frozen last month by a Dade County judge whoappointed a curator for the estate.   Kerstein says Ms. DeSillers spent at least $47,000 of themissing money on jewelry, clothes, furniture, a BMW automobile anda Biscayne Bay apartment. He declined to break down that figure orelaborate on additional expenditures because of his office'sinvestigation into possible fraud and other criminal violations.   Ms. DeSillers says she never squandered any of the donations andgave as much as $175,000 to families of transplant patients.   She says she bought her 1984 BMW at an auction for $13,000 andher one-bedroom apartment doubles as her office, which shefurnished with a computer and other equipment. The apartment rentsfor $850 a month, but she says her one-year lease includes threefree months.   Some of her own money was deposited with the donations, shesays, and she used it to buy back jewelry she had pawned to paymedical bills. She says she also used some of the money to repayloans she took out to get Ronnie to Pittsburgh.   ``People don't realize I was not an accountant and I was not anattorney and I did not have guidebooks,'' she said.   Ms. DeSillers is appealing a $1,000 fine for violating Florida'sSolicitation of Charitable Contributions Act, which mandates thatsolicitations for single individuals go solely to the beneficiary.She maintains she never asked for donations, but received themthrough sympathetic news accounts.   Reacting to the furor, a Florida Senate committee approved abill on April 20 to more strictly regulate charitable contributions.   Ms. DeSillers has also been criticized for paying herself $300 aweek as president of the Ronnie DeSillers National Foundation. ``Iwas working 17 hours a day,'' she said in her defense.   The doubts and bitterness raised by the DeSillers case havehardly been a boon to organ donation.   ``It has made people even more suspicious of the transplantfield in terms of fairness and equity, and I think therefore it hashad a dangerous effect on the willingness of people to be organdonors,'' said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for BiomedicalEthics at the University of Minnesota.   On the other hand, Caplan said, ``the case highlights theinadequacy of the way in which we fund innovation and progress inmedical research. ... Families shouldn't need to beg for money ordepend on charity.''   The DeSillers case has also made fund raising more difficult,according to Mary Ann Lunde, chairman of the National OrganTransplant Education Foundation in Fort Lauderdale.   ``It's sort of heart-breaking when you think about how thiscommunity (south Florida) responded to Ronnie DeSillers' needs .. .and now it's having the opposite, negative impact,'' Mrs. Lundesaid.   Ms. DeSillers is chronicling her and Ronnie's struggle in a bookshe began writing four months ago. She says it includes``everything that happened in the hospital: names, dates,circumstances.''   ``I know there's a reason for everything that happens and I knowin the end, out of the ashes, comes the phoenix,'' she said. ``Iknow in the end, it will be for the good of other children thatRonnie died.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, April 25</NOTE></DOC>
