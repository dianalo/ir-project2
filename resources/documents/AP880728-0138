News organizations had requested the information, which consistsof affidavits filed by prosecutors in order to gain warrants tosearch defense contractors' offices.   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon in Los Angeles reversed aruling by U.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann earlier this month thatthe documents from the California portion of the investigationshould be unsealed.   ``On balance,'' Kenyon said, ``the public's interest in acomplete and uninhibited investigation strongly outweighs its needfor or right of access to the search warrant affidavits at thistime.''   The government has released minor portions of some documents butfought for secrecy on more important information.   Earlier this month in Los Angeles, the government released 30pages that showed federal agents wiretapped telephone conversationsto gather information on Northrop Corp., Teledyne Electronics andLitton Industries.   In Bridgeport, U.S. District Judge T.F. Gilroy Daly said thedocuments sought by The Hartford Courant ``are extremely detailedand contain information that would certainly endanger the ongoinggrand jury proceedings.''   The newspaper had sought documents on searches at Connecticutoffices of Norden Systems, a United Technologies Corp. subsidiary.   ``There is a right under the First Amendment of access to courtdocuments,'' the judge said. ``But at this early stage, the rightis a qualified and limited one.''   The government agreed, however, to unseal very limited parts ofthe documents that describe the person who swore out the affidavitand the premises searched, and the introductory section of theaffidavit.   Ralph Elliot, the Courant's attorney, said the ruling was ``morelimited than other judges have made and it is disappointing.''   The Pentagon investigation centers on allegations that defensecontractors and consultants, many of them former military men,bribed Pentagon officials for inside information useful in winningcontracts worth billions of dollars.   Norden is suspected of benefiting from inside information tobuild a battlefield communication system for the Marines, accordingto other documents already released in the investigation.   Earlier this month, Norden withdrew from the bidding for thecommunications system, citing the suspicions raised by theinvestigation.   U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr., said today, however, that aNorden program not disclosed so far is the only one underinvestigation. He declined further comment.   Norden officials did not immediately return telephone calls.   The Courant last week asked for release of documents related tothe June 14 search of Norden offices in Bridgeport, Trumbull andNorwalk and a June 15 search of the Shelton home of James E.Rapinac, a senior vice president.   The information released today said federal agents searched theEast Norwalk office of Bill Kingston, Norden executive vicepresident, and other areas of the building where his documents arestored and his secretary sits.   The documents also said agents went to Norden offices occupiedby Jack Richardson and Vice President Roger Engle, and other areasof the building where documents, calendars, files and otherinformation they keep would be stored.   It wasn't known what position Richardson holds.</TEXT></DOC>
