Fund managers in general have been cautiously raising cash, to an average of more than 10% of their portfolios now. But the best-performing funds for the second quarter, six months and longer periods ended June 30 have plugged away full throttle, remaining fully invested.    Unlike some of last year's stars, the current crop of top managers don't attempt to time the market. They seek good values in individual stocks. What sets them apart is where they have put their cash: Whether it's small-company medical issues or large Japanese consumer stocks, the top four fund managers share a penchant for investing in offbeat issues.    &quot;Extreme performance usually means unusual positions,&quot; says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services.    Neil Eigen, who runs Integrated Equity Aggressive Growth Fund, the six-month fund leader, says too many managers use the same research and buy the same stocks.    Here is a look at how the current top performers got there:   SECOND-QUARTER LEADER   Kaufmann Fund +25.93   Lawrence Auriana and Hans Utsch, Fund Managers   The tiny $2.8 million Kaufmann Fund, with a portfolio of only 18 stocks, snagged the second-quarter top spot by investing in several obscure medical issues.    Take Chantal Pharmaceutical, a development-stage drug company comprising one-quarter of the fund. The over-the-counter issue, which soared about 40% in the quarter, is testing a non-toxic product for treating acne and male baldness. Two major caveats: The company has yet to report earnings, and it could take years to receive regulatory approval.    The fund leans toward companies that can easily generate repeat business. Lawrence Auriana, co-manager, cites Trimedyne, an over-the-counter issue that has won regulatory approval to market a laser method of cleaning the arteries of limbs. Even more alluring are the company's disposable catheters. &quot;It's a nice repeat business with very high gross margins,&quot; he says.    Neither of the fund's two managers has any medical experience, and Mr. Auriana concedes investing in such issues can be &quot;treacherous.&quot; He doesn't pay much attention to market moves, and takes a &quot;bottoms up&quot; approach by analyzing individual companies.    YEAR-TO-DATE LEADER   Integrated Equity Aggressive Growth Fund +51.38%   Neil Eigen, Fund Manager   Another fund buffered by little-known issues is Integrated Resources Inc.'s $19 million Aggressive Growth Portfolio. Mr. Eigen, the fund manager, seeks stocks ignored by most analysts; some favorites include Wolohan Lumber, which operates home-improvement centers in the Midwest, and Heileg-Meyers, a Southern furniture retailer.    Both stocks reflect Mr. Eigen's so-called private-market value theme. &quot;The key is not what a stock is selling on an exchange, but what its worth is to another business,&quot; he says.    Mr. Eigen eschews the cold calculation of some fund managers; he likes to invest with his gut.    He bought L.A. Gear earlier this year after shopping with his daughter and seeing kids buying its sneakers. And he recently beefed up the fund's holding of Nike for the same reason.    Mr. Eigen pays scant attention to broad market moves. And he tends to hold issues for the long term -- even when the trend seems to be working against him. For instance, he continues to hold Stewart andamp; Stevenson Services, a maker of gas-powered generators, bought based on his so-called weak dollar theme.    The dollar's upturn hasn't fazed him, though it could help Stewart's Japanese rivals. He says he will wait it out: &quot;My feeling still is, we're in pretty good shape.&quot;    FIVE-YEAR LEADER   Merrill Lynch Pacific Fund +299.23%   Stephen Silverman, Fund Manager   The $321 million Merrill Lynch Pacific Fund has ridden the rising wave of the Tokyo stock market this year, propping its Japanese holdings to about 80% of the portfolio. &quot;The Japanese economy is fundamentally strong, with abundant liquidity,&quot; Mr. Silverman says in a recent fund report. The fund has whittled its cash position to nearly nil now from about 30% at year end.    Mr. Silverman focuses on companies that will benefit from the surge in Japanese consumer spending, including Ito-Yokado, Yamaha, Kao and Shimachu.    And he has tried to position the fund to capitalize on an increase in capital spending; companies that he figures will benefit from this trend include Amano and Komori Printing. That's a far cry from recent years, when he bet big on Japanese property-casualty insurers.    Pharmaceuticals is another area of the fund's current concentration. Drug firms earn much higher returns on equity and capital than other firms, Mr. Silverman maintains, and he believes the fairly rapid aging of the Japanese population should continue to trigger above-average earnings growth rates.    He shrugs off fears that the Japanese market is far overvalued; about his only concern is a rapid rise in Japanese interest rates, which could trigger a drastic drop in that country's stock market.    TEN-YEAR LEADER   Fidelity Magellan Fund +1,325.01%   Peter Lynch, Fund Manager   Mr. Lynch's $9.1 billion megafund continues to shine, rising 8.46% in the second quarter. And despite holding hundreds of small-company growth stocks, he says Magellan has the largest weighting of large companies the fund has held in five years. Forget about a plan; he says &quot;it just worked out that way.&quot;    Mr. Lynch has recently beefed up the fund's financial-services holdings; Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, makes up about 3% of the portfolio's assets based on his higher earnings expectations. And he continues to favor American Express.    He also has bolstered bank issues, such as Chemical, Chase and BankAmerica, and regionals like Security Pacific to the fund's 1,400 holdings. And despite flat prices, he's plunked money into British money-center banks such as National Westminster, based on their relative cheapness and low exposure to Latin debt.    The fund has been boosted by the rebound in cyclical issues; Mr. Lynch has added to Magellan's holdings of paper stocks, such as Great Northern and Meade, and metal issues like Phelps Dodge that have been helped by higher commodity prices.    Mr. Lynch estimates the fund's average price/earnings multiple at about eight -- far below that of the broad markets. He continues to scour for companies with solid earnings.    &quot;You don't have to worry about the 'p' part anymore -- 600 points have been taken out of the market,&quot; he says. &quot;It's the 'e' part you have to be concerned with.&quot;  How the Biggest Stock Funds Have Performed   Percentage gains for periods ended June 30; assets as of March 31.
