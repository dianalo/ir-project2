In response, the big brokerage firms announced sweepingdisciplinary actions of their own -- including dismissals andsalary cuts -- against a number of executives in addition tothose announced last month when the scandal broke.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, the four securities firms -- NomuraSecurities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co.and Yamaichi Securities Co. -- acknowledged that theyactually paid out twice as much as previously disclosed tocompensate trading losses suffered by favored clients. It nowappears the four firms paid 126.4 billion yen ($915 million)to cover clients' trading losses, compared with the 68.85billion yen that the firms first admitted to paying as thescandal unfolded.   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a packed newsconference yesterday that the ministry ordered the nation'sfour largest brokerage houses to &quot;voluntarily&quot; close downtheir corporate sales divisions for four business daysbeginning Wednesday, and take disciplinary action againstsome top executives.   In addition to the punishment for the compensationtransgression, he said, the ministry has asked No. 1-rankedNomura and No. 3-ranked Nikko to suspend sales activities attheir main offices during the four-day period. The additionalsanctions are aimed at penalizing Nomura and Nikko for theirdealings with Susumu Ishii, the retired leader of one ofJapan's most notorious crime syndicates, Mr. Hashimoto said.Officials at Nomura and Nikko helped Mr. Ishii secure hugeloans secured by worthless golf club memberships and sharesin Tokyu Corp., a Japanese rail concern. The ministry isinvestigating allegations that Nomura officials helped Mr.Ishii inflate the price of the shares by bidding up theirprice.   Ministry officials hope the measures -- the most thegovernment has ever imposed on Japan's securities industry --will send a signal to brokers and deter the sort of unfairtransactions that many believe have plagued this market fordecades. Deploring the behavior of four firms as &quot;shameless&quot;and &quot;inexcusable,&quot; Mr. Hashimoto said reports of thepay-backs and dealings with gangsters have caused theJapanese public to &quot;lose faith in the securities industry.&quot;   Mr. Hashimoto declined to estimate how much revenue thefour firms will lose as a result of the ministry's directive.&quot;The point is not to inflict injury&quot; on the brokerage houses,he said. &quot;The point is to make certain the problem doesn'thappen again.&quot;   Indeed, the penalty is more symbolic than painful.Analysts estimated that the order will have relatively littleimpact on the earnings of the four firms, which rank amongthe most profitable companies in the world. The companieswill be free to continue sales and trading operations ontheir own account and for individual clients through hundredsof local branch offices throughout Japan. In addition, thefirms will be free to continue their equities underwritingoperations.   Officials from the Tokyo Stock Exchange said they alsowill take action against the four firms, fining them a totalof 16 million yen -- a minor penalty relative to the firms'vast earnings.   At separate news conferences, each of the firms detailedits own disciplinary actions planned in response to theministry's orders.   Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki said two executives atNomura and two executives at Nomura group companies have beenforced to resign in connection with the transactions with Mr.Ishii. In addition, 30 Nomura officials, including chairmanSetsuya Tabuchi, vice chariman Yoshihisa Tabuchi and Mr.Sakamaki, will receive salary cuts of an unspecified amount,Mr. Sakamaki said.   Nikko announced that two officials resigned and 17 wouldtake pay cuts of as much as 10% for the company's connectionto organized crime figures. In addition, three otherofficials received 10% salary cuts for their responsibilityin making compensation payments. Daiwa imposed salaryreductions of as much as 10% on its chairman, vice chairman,president and vice president. Yamaichi imposed cuts of up to20% on its chairman and seven other top officials.   The presidents of Nomura and Nikko resigned two weeks agoto take responsibility for company involvement in thescandals.   Mr. Hashimoto, the finance minister, who has come underfire himself for the scandal, acknowledged yesterday that theministry must bear some criticism for failing to enforce aDecember 1989 directive that sought to end the practice ofcompensating clients for losses. Under Japanese securitieslaw, such payments after losses have occurred aren't illegal,but compensation can't be promised in advance.   The 1989 directive was issued after officials at 20Japanese securities houses, including Daiwa and Yamaichi,compensated large investors for losses sustained during the1987 Black Monday market crash. In connection with thosepayments, Daiwa and Yamaichi had to shut down some of theiroperations for a two-day period.</TEXT></DOC>
