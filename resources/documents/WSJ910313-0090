Despite all the new talk these days about &quot;unity,&quot; weshould not forget that the Senate, after being AWOL for morethan two crucial months, backed the president by a timid52-to-47 vote. Put three of those winning votes with the 45Democrats (and two Republicans) who voted against OperationDesert Storm, and suddenly you have the Senate forcing thepresident to blink as he goes face-to-face with SaddamHussein.</LP><TEXT>   As Saddam found out, President Bush didn't blink. Neitherdid the American people nor Colin Powell, Dick Cheney, NormSchwarzkopf, and the world's finest fighting men and women.Faced with the toughest decisions of his life -- and our time-- President Bush made the right calls. And thank God he did.   We now know -- categorically -- that sanctions were alosing game, despite the passionate claims of the opposition.We now know that sanctions would have been a gift-wrappedtimeout for Saddam Hussein; a morale-busting stand-down for ahalf million American troops sweating it out in the desert;and a free pass for Saddam Hussein to resupply his warmachine, dig his troops in deeper, and take full advantage ofincreasingly leaky international sanctions.   We now know that sanctions would have meant another sixmonths, a year, two years for Baghdad to develop chemical,biological and nuclear weapons; another holiday for Saddam'shenchmen, behind closed doors in Kuwait, to intensify theirgrisly reign of terror; another reprieve to shelter hundredsof Scud missiles aimed at Israeli and Arab civilians.   Let's face it. Desert Storm's defeat in the U.S. Senatewould have been one of history's most serious blows against apresident in a crisis -- remember, only three Senate votesstood between the stunning success of Operation Desert Stormand allied disaster.   Hard to believe now, but two months ago, on the Senatefloor, here's what some of my distinguished colleagues on theother side of the aisle said about the president's toughstance against the invasion of Kuwait:   -- &quot;President Bush appears to be on the verge of making aterrible mistake that will have tragic consequences for thewhole world.&quot;   -- &quot;The administration is making a great mistake.&quot;   -- &quot;War would be a tragic mistake.&quot;   -- &quot;We are on a disastrous course.&quot;   -- &quot;The rush to combat now . . . is . . . tragicallyshortsighted.&quot;   -- &quot;The president . . . has moved in the wrong direction.&quot;   -- &quot;We are going to make such a tremendous blunder.&quot;   -- &quot;The president is marching this country toward asenseless and unnecessary war.&quot;   -- &quot;The president is wrong to have threatened Iraq withwar.&quot;   -- The president should retreat &quot;back to the defensivepositions of the period up to Nov. 8th.&quot;   -- &quot;I suggest that it is a special arrogance that assumesthat we can somehow bring peace&quot; to the Persian Gulf region.   American forces could well be &quot;bogged down by sandstormsand a determined enemy.&quot;   -- &quot;I believe it would be better policy for the UnitedStates to cease from threatening war if Saddam Hussein doesnot withdraw from Kuwait.&quot;   One Democratic senator went so far as to say that &quot;weshould stay the course . . ., not lurch to war under theillusion that it will be cheap, short, heroic or conclusive.&quot;Another declared &quot;about the only certainty is that we are notgoing to be hailed as heroes or liberators in many corners ofthe Arab world.&quot;   Never before have so many been so wrong about so much.   And never before have so many been so defensive about onevote, which is all the more reason that a re-reading of thedebate is in order:   -- &quot;The essence of democracy is accountability.&quot;   -- &quot;Not a single one of us can escape the judgment ofhistory which will be rendered upon the actions we taketoday. . . . We cannot escape history.&quot;   -- &quot;Future generations will sit in judgment of our successor our failure.&quot;   Those aren't my words -- those are the words of prominentDemocrats on the floor of the Senate, some of the samesenators who are now doing all they can to duckaccountability for their votes against Operation DesertStorm.   When it came to what many described as the most importantvote of their careers, 45 Senate Democrats voted against thepresident, against launching Operation Desert Storm. Irespect each and every one who voted that way. It was a toughcall. I don't question the patriotism of a single member.   But you can't have it both ways. When the chips are down,you have to take a stand -- your constituents expect no less.Those of us who supported the president certainly understoodthe possible consequences of our votes.   Believe me, I have had a few of my votes called intoquestion in re-election campaigns, but I have never had theluxury of singling out votes as &quot;off-limits,&quot; as manyDemocrats are now demanding.   It's sad how some politicians, even as the first warheroes are coming home, are trying desperately to push ournational celebration off the front pages, raining on theparade before it even starts.   No one should ever talk about the vote authorizing force,we are told. Instead, we must talk about their liberal&quot;domestic agenda,&quot; complete with doom and gloom forecasts,laundry lists of big-ticket federal programs and new taxes.   In his dramatic address to Congress last week, PresidentBush tossed the domestic issue right back at Congress with atough challenge of his own: If we can win the land war in 100hours, surely Congress can stop talking and enact meaningfullegislation in 100 days.   Many pundits are predicting that 1992 will be the nexttest of accountability, that &quot;essence of democracy.&quot; Ourvotes on the domestic agenda will no doubt be part of thattest. Like it or not, so will our votes for, or against,Desert Storm.   Looking back at the Senate debate, I see at least oneDemocrat agrees: &quot;If we are wrong and the American peoplewant to go to war, then in the election of 1992 I assumethose people who feel my vote was wrong will vote againstme.&quot;   ---   Sen. Dole (R., Kan.) is the Senate minority leader.</TEXT></DOC>
