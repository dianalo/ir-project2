But the 45-year-old Corpus Christi man couldn't afford to do morethan look until the developers of a nearby Padre Island condominumslashed the price of their units by at least 40 percent.   He and wife Kay recently snapped up a ``buy of a lifetime''two-bedroom, oceanfront condo for $113,000, and received easyfinancing.   ``The only thing I regret is that I didn't buy a three-bedroomcondo instead,'' Jackson said.   A number of equally anxious vacationers won't just be sunbathingat the beach, fishing the lakes and hiking the woods this summer.They're also likely to do some serious sightseeing in the localhousing market.   Despite an overall slump in the property business nationwide,real estate experts say this season is turning out to be a hot onefor many buyers.   Many parts of the country offer bargain prices due to the falloutfrom recent tax-reform changes, overbuilding, regional economicdownturns and declining interest rates, experts say.   ``If I was in the market for a second home ... I would considernow a good time to buy,'' said Tom Franks, a senior vice presidentfor the American Resort andamp; Residential Development Association, aWashington-based trade group. ``There are a lot of good values outthere.''   Although bargains can be had in just about any state if you lookhard enough, the market for the nation's 5.5 million vacation homesvaries by region just as with vacation spots.   Some of the standouts this year, Franks and other experts say,include properties located in parts of Florida; the Rockies; theTexas gulf coast; Hilton Head Island, S.C.; Palm Springs, Calif.;and parts of New England.   Condominiums, in particular, carry big price cuts, experts say.Units in the low- to medium-price range, which were eagerly snappedup by investors during the inflationary 1970s and early 1980s, arebeing unloaded because the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated most ofthe tax incentives on second homes, particularly for those who rentout their properties.   ``There's more demand this year for detached homes, little lessdemand in condos. That's where I think one can do quite well,'' saidGary Dionne, an agent with ERA Byse Realtors, a Laconia, N.H.,broker that sells vacation homes in resort areas like LakeWinnipesaukee.   He said vacation homes prices, in general, have flattened out inNew Hampshire this year after skyrocketing two years ago. Pricesrange from around $75,000 to $500,000.   Condo prices on Hilton Head Island, S.C., have declined by about40 percent overall from the mid-1980s, although oceanfront propertyhasn't been hurt as much, according to local broker Juliana ToonPawley of Coldwell Banker andamp; Co.   For as little as $25,000, bargain hunters can pick up a modesttwo-bedroom modular unit on the Atlantic, about a quarter of whatthey sold for five years ago, Mrs. Pawley said. More upscaleoceanfront condos usually start at around $120,000, she said.   Further south, in the northern portion of Padre Island, Texas,where Jackson, the Corpus Christi electrician, bought his vacationhome, waterfront units that sold for $200,000 three years ago now gofor around $120,000, said one developer, Jack Ponton of NisbetPonton Corp.   ``It's probably below cost,'' Ponton said, but added that pricesare starting to rebound a bit from last year as the oil-driven Texaseconomy improves.   Out West, older homes and condos in the Rockies also have beenespecially hit hard, experts say.   Los Angeles accountant Stan Ross said the three-bedroom house hebought in the popular ski resort area of Park City, Utah, wouldprobably fetch the same price he bought it at seven years ago _around $120,000.   But Ross is taking the market downturn in stride. He said hebought his vacation home as an easy getaway to enjoy and relax,rather than as an alternative to the financial markets.   Experts agree that prospective buyers should consider more thanjust price when looking for a second home.   What good is owning an inexpensive cabin across the country, forinstance, if it costs a fortune to get there?   ``Most middle-income buyers should look at some place that can bereached within a day's drive,'' said Franks. ``You shouldn't buysomething that doesn't have demand.   ``It's kind of like anything in life: A bargain is not a bargainunless it's something you want,'' said Franks.   John Diamond, senior vice president for Real Estate ResearchCorp. in Chicago, said buyers should do some careful research beforereaching any decision, like tracking local economic trends or makingsure the area in which they plan to buy isn't being overbuilt.   It's also important to get a handle on local property taxes.``You want to make sure it is a vacation home,'' said Diamond.``Some people are shocked when they thought they bought a vacationhome ... and found themselves faced with the high cost of providingschools and infrastructure in the far out suburbs.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 11</NOTE></DOC>
