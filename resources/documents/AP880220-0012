Newt Gingrich, contending that publishedreports have outlined ``clear violations of House rules'' bySpeaker Jim Wright, says he intends to ask the House ethicscommittee next month to launch a formal investigation.   Gingrich, R-Ga., told a news conference Friday that the Houseneeds to know the truth about the allegations of corruption thathave been leveled at Wright, D-Texas, in news accounts over thepast decade.   ``We're going to have to at least at a minimum insist that wefind out what the truth is, and on March 3, I intend to create thatopportunity,'' Gingrich said.   Wright's office did not return a telephone call Friday seekingcomment on Gingrich's plan to seek an ethics committeeinvestigation.   Gingrich said two specific published reports about Wrightprovide clear evidence that he violated House rules. One involvedWright's failure since 1980 to file the required financialdisclosure reports for a company in which he is a partner.   The other involved 55 percent royalties Wright received for abook published by a friend whose printing company worked forWright's campaign committee. House rules prohibit members fromreceiving royalties in excess of ``the usual and customary valuefor such services,'' Gingrich said, and most authors receiveroyalties of 6 percent to 8 percent.   Gingrich said the ethics panel also should investigate Wright'sconnection to Texas savings and loan association officials who areunder investigation by federal authorities.   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee last monthaccused Gingrich and a political action committee he heads of mailfraud and asked the Postal Service to investigate. The DCCC saidthe PAC collected more than $200,000 through mail solicitations ofcontributions for conservative candidates, but provided only $3,000to such candidates.   Gingrich, who has denied the accusations, said Friday the DCCCcomplaint was a ``smoke screen'' designed to discredit himpolitically so he could not pursue the ethics complaints againstWright.   Under House rules, any member can ask the ethics panel toinvestigate another member. The committee, composed of sixDemocrats and six Republicans, can reject such a request only by amajority vote.   Gingrich said it would be ``inconceivable'' that the committeewould refuse to investigate the allegations. But if that happens,he said he intends to force the issue on the House floor with aseries of privileged votes that could tie up House business.   Gingrich tried unsuccessfully last year to persuade the House tocreate an outside commission to investigate ethics complaintsagainst Wright and other Democratic leaders.   He said he was announcing his intention to seek an investigationof Wright now to give other House members time to familiarizethemselves with the long list of allegations.   Gingrich has criticized the ethics committee in the past for itslenient treatment of Democrats accused of wrongdoing. But he saidFriday he has more confidence in the panel after its recent votesto reprimand one Democratic congressman and recommend the expulsionof another.   He said he believes the panel can conduct a fair investigationof Wright if it will agree to hire an outside attorney acceptableto both Republican and Democratic House leaders and to complete itsinvestigation before Congress adjourns for the year.</TEXT></DOC>
