A number of workers, stimulated by this challenge,have been attracted to the problem. In this paper I review recent evolutionarymodels of relatively low mass AGB stars, with emphasis placed on themixing of carbon to the stellar surface. In particular I discuss somerecent improvements in the physics used to construct stellar models.These topics include: breathing pulses of the convective core found duringexhaustion of the core helium supply; the effects of carbon recombination;the occurrence of semiconvection in the region between the two nuclearburning shells, and the importance of mass loss. It appears that differenteffects may operate at different stellar masses and abundances. Recentcalculations have successfully produced models of low luminosity Carbonstars. The strengths and weaknesses of these models will be contrasted.60 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
