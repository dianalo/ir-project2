June delivery gold ended 40 cents an ounce lower at $451.20, after dropping at one point as low as $449.70. July silver was off two cents an ounce to $6.6250 and July delivery platinum settled at $540.60 an ounce for a loss of $4.60, after trading as low as $530.    The initial impact of major banks' prime rate increase to 9% from 8 1/2% was to drive precious metals prices lower.    &quot;The increase strengthened the dollar, which was bearish for precious metals,&quot; said Bette Raptopoulos, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. However, she added: &quot;Down the road the higher interest rate will make borrowed money more expensive, and that's inflationary, which contributed to the recovery.&quot;    Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors Inc., New York consultants, said anticipation that the rise would take place caused it to have only a temporary effect.    According to Mr. Nichols, gold &quot;behaved quite well&quot; in recovering yesterday. However, when gold climbed back to around the $450 level, selling from mining companies restrained the rebound, he noted.    &quot;I think that if gold succeeds in reaching as high as $455, there should be further increase in producer selling,&quot; Mr. Nichols said. &quot;Over the longer term, I see the market holding in a relatively narrow range, unless there is a significant increase in Far Eastern buying of gold or if there is a major change in trade deficit figures,&quot; he said.    Robert Radoccia, chief bullion dealer for the New York branch of Union Bank of Switzerland, was impressed not only with the way gold resisted declining and then recovered, but also by the rebounds of silver and platinum toward the end of trading.    &quot;When the market absorbs heavy selling, as this one did, and still comes back, it indicates to me that it wants to go higher,&quot; Mr. Radoccia said.    According to David Sobotka, manager of bullion trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York, buyers of precious metals to some degree are being influenced by advances in prices of other commodities.    &quot;However, investors who normally buy the precious metals themselves are on the sidelines,&quot; he said. &quot;They've been burned by too many inflation scares. But, if precious metals do recover significantly, these investors might decide to come back into the market.&quot;    Vahid Fahti, analyst for Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben, Inc. in Cleveland, said that over the short term &quot;I see the market moving sideways to slightly higher, as the increase in interest rates raises the cost of carrying gold.&quot;    For the long term, he said, precious metals prices should rise more, as the result of a relatively higher rate of inflation.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   LIVESTOCK andamp; MEATS: Hog futures prices closed at new life-of-contract highs as the seasonal drop in slaughter continued to deepen, said Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., St. Louis. The rise in futures price came as the cash price paid by meatpackers for live hogs hit a new high for the year of 48.50 cents a pound. Cash and futures prices for hogs normally rise this time of year as the supply of hogs fat enough to slaughter dwindles. Many hog farmers plan it this way so they can concentrate on planting crops in the spring. Cattle futures prices rose as the cash price paid by meatpackers for live cattle also flirted with a new high for the year of 78 cents a pound. Cattle futures prices have been edging up slowly in recent weeks as traders were shrugging off a recent Agriculture Department report that a larger-than-expected number of fattened cattle were ready for slaughter.    SUGAR: Futures prices rose sharply on news of an attempted military uprising in Guatemala and report of buying of sugar by the Soviet Union. The July delivery contract rose 0.26 cent to 9.17 cents. A trade source said the market was strengthened because prices of both the July and October contracts rose above nine cents a pound and held their gains. Impetus for the rise came from press reports that there had been an attempted military overthrow of the Guatemalan government and that the rebels said all exports would be banned, according to the dealer. He described Guatemala as a medium-size exporter, but an important one because much of its sugar is delivered on the futures exchange in New York. Toward the end of the day it became apparent the revolt wasn't successful, he said, but demand for contracts continued on talk in London that the Soviet Union had bought about 30,000 tons of raw sugar. &quot;That quantity isn't really significant, because when the Soviets come into the market they buy in large quantities,&quot; he said.    GRAINS andamp; SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices rose in the wake of the Agriculture Department's Tuesday forecast for smaller-than-expected U.S. stockpiles for this year and 1989. The rise in futures prices, however, was damped by profittaking, said Mario Balletto, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York. Another department forecast for a bigger-than-expected winter wheat harvest this summer caused wheat futures prices to drop slightly. Corn futures prices fell because of heavy selling by commodity funds.    COCOA: Futures prices fell on selling of cocoa beans by producing countries. July delivery cocoa was off $39 a metric ton to $1,590. Futures prices in London declined on selling thought to be hedging against purchases of cocoa beans from Nigeria and Cameroon. This, in turn, influenced the New York market, an analyst said. Also, the Ivory Coast was said to be inquiring about selling cocoa beans, the analyst said. The Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, has hardly sold this year and it has to unload supplies it has. &quot;With the market overburdened as it is with surpluses, it can't withstand selling from such a major source as the Ivory Coast,&quot; the analyst said.    ENERGY: Gasoline futures prices rose on an unexpected drop in gasoline supplies, but other energy futures showed small changes. Gasoline for July delivery rose 0.58 cent a gallon to 51.39 cents. Crude oil futures for July delivery advanced three cents a barrel, to $17.64, and heating oil for July delivery was up 0.06 cent to 46.99 cents a gallon. The report from the American Petroleum Institute, released after the close of trading Tuesday, showed a decline of almost three million barrels in U.S. gasoline supplies for the week ended May 6 to almost 227 million barrels. The decline comes as the peak gasoline consumption season is approaching, the analyst said, and he noted that current gasoline inventories are almost 12 million barrels below a year ago. </TEXT></DOC>
