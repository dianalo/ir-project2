And later with elephants.   So much so that without any scientific training, she has becomean authority on the elephants of Amboseli National Park in Kenyaand has published an account based on 13 years of observing thepopulation and its behavior through periods of drought andscarcity, plentiful rain and overabundance. She watched aspoachers, Masai warriors, injury, disease and tourists interfered.Some survived. Some did not.   Her book, ``Elephant Memories,'' tells much about the intricatebonding among elephants and the elaborate kinship throughout theirlives.   It's a story of a matriarchal society with rings and rings ofrelationships, from the most intense, the mother and her newborncalf, to the mother and her other immature offspring, throughfamily units, bond groups and clans.   Moss was able to observe the canniness of the older matriarchsin times of drought. Confirming the powers of elephants' memories,they remembered from previous droughts where vegetation was mostlikely to survive and so they managed. In tough times, she found,elephants break up into smaller groups to forage more effectively.   She saw that family members will risk danger, charging thepoachers to protect their own, while more distant clan members willrun.   ``The book is not just about numbers,'' says Moss, director ofelephant research in the park. ``I want people to realize howspecial elephants are. How funny, how endearing they can be. I wantpeople to know that so they care enough to save them.''   She writes of the elephantine joy as they greet each other aftera separation, or as young males gleefully play-fight with eachother. She writes about elephant grief as the mother of a dead calftries to force grass into her mouth to bring it back to life andtries over and over to hoist it to its feet.   She writes with wonder about what is going on in their brains asthey come upon the bones of an elephant and minutely inspect them,throwing them in the air, perhaps to decipher the correct obituary.   One prestigious critic, who liked the book, accused her ofanthropomorphizing the behemoths.   ``That's a rather out-of-date thing to say,'' retorts Moss. ``Ascientist would not make that accusation. That is all part of fieldwork.''   Moss considers herself lucky for getting a head start in herfield work by being offered a research assistant's job by IainDouglas-Hamilton, a pioneer in using extensive photography so thathe could eventually recognize over 500 individual elephants in astudy in Tanzania. Moss worked with him for several years beforeembarking on her own.   ``Today, it would be almost impossible to do it the way I didit,'' she says. ``For someone with no field experience to get apaying job would be almost impossible.''   She estimates that her research, paid for mainly by the AfricanWildlife Foundation, the Merlin Foundation and the New YorkZoological Society, probably cost $100,000 for her nearly 20 yearsin the wild.   Moss did not live all alone for long periods, such as JaneGoodall did initially in her studies of chimpanzees, or the lateDiane Fossey in her gorilla work. Other researchers were nearby.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
