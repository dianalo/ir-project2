Letter vaporlist. (software product delays)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>PENPOINT: What am I going to do, huh? I think Penpoint is important enoughthat it will definitely affect people's purchasing decisions  which is a keyelement to getting on the Vaporlist) and it won't be available to customersuntil OEMs deliver it with their machines.andP;  But Go Corp. is in the systemsoftware business, so I can probably only legitimately put it on the list aslong as it hasn't been delivered to the OEMs.andP;  Go Corp. has also announcedthat the user release will work on the 386, which the developer's releasewill not.andP;  So I've come to the conclusion that the version I should list isthe OEM version of the 386-based Penpoint, whch is due to OEMs sometime thisfall, which I will interpret as December.andM;PEN WINDOWS: Microsoft is engaging in classic vapor wars, by not reallyannouncing a competitive product and yet somehow managing to get everyarticle about Penponit to mention it  not to mention a screen shot inFortune).andP;  This is as bad as lotus announcing 1-2-3 Mac just before theintroduction of Excel for Windows, simply to confuse the issue.andP;  So on thelist it goes, but without a due date, just like 1-2-3 Mac.andP;  Microsoft isbeginning to act like the rules that everybody else is supposed to followdon't apply to itself.andP;  That's not a good sign.andP;  TABULAR DATA OMITTED</TEXT></DOC>
