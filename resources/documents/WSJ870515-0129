McCarthy</HL><DD> 05/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Across the country last year, 61,232 firms failed.    Most were small businesses, and half of those were less than five years old. No market was exempt. Entrepreneurial bubbles burst in industries from mining, manufacturing and construction to wholesaling, retailing and real estate.    What happened? A goodly number went belly up because their proprietors didn't mind their business. Distracted perhaps by daily toils and tasks, these owners didn't listen to customers. Or they hired inexperienced help. Or they didn't keep talking to investors and bankers. Or they missed the signs of decay hidden in their financial reports.    &quot;Entrepreneurs need a heavy ego,&quot; says Debra Klein, a small-business consultant in Montgomery County, Md. &quot;But they often want to fulfill fantasies and dreams rather than face facts.&quot;    There are obvious and not-so-obvious ways to tell when a business is in trouble. Spot one of these red flags soon enough, and there's a chance to save the day.    One clear warning is unhappy customers. When clients returned printed circuit boards to H-R Industries Inc., the Richardson, Texas-based company's senior managers dismissed the customers' complaints as unfounded. Business was robust, says Paul Dickinson, president, and the managers were &quot;feeling their oats a little too much.&quot;    A faulty production process, which Mr. Dickinson discovered later, along with other factors nearly put the company in bankruptcy in late 1985. &quot;We were wrong and I went bonkers,&quot; he says. &quot;When you start getting your product back, it's a sign you've got trouble.&quot;    Other signs are lack of solid management experience and poor relations with investors and financial advisers. It's tough for owners of the 18.5 million small businesses in this country to be objective about their operations. For that reason, lenders and acccountants get edgy when they see a management team of one -- especially in a growing company. So they like to be consulted and worry when they're not.    The entrepreneur often assumes he can operate on intuition, says Victor Coppola, director of emerging business services at Coopers andamp; Lybrand, the accounting firm. &quot;Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.&quot;    For Carl Moechnig, it didn't. The mechanical engineer had to turn over his high-tech equipment concern, Automated Electronic Technology in North St. Paul, Minn., to new management in late 1985. &quot;As an engineer, I was very inadept at financing,&quot; he says. The company's venture capitalists were worried. They thought he wasn't seasoned enough; he thought he could accumulate experience as it was needed. They won.    Mr. Moechnig, who has started a new business, blames the near-failure of Automated Electronic on a &quot;soiled&quot; relationship with the company's investors. &quot;I guess I learned a lot,&quot; he says. He plans to hire managers for his new business and to keep relations pleasant with his lenders and investors.    One way to keep relations good is to maintain current, reliable financial reports. Without them, says Ms. Klein, the consultant, &quot;there can be a hemorrhage somewhere and you probably won't find it until it's too late.&quot; That's what happened to her parents' Washington-area retail record and book chain. The chain grew to a $5 million-a-year operation before it folded several years ago.    &quot;The longer you're in business, there's a danger of resting on your laurels,&quot; says Ms. Klein.    Business soured at the chain when the record industry slumped and a big book discounter opened nearby. Meanwhile, delayed income and inventory statements masked customer and employee theft.    Soon, the enterprise began to display the classic early warning signs of failure. &quot;You're not making your sales projections,&quot; says Ms. Klein. &quot;So you're not able to pay your bills. Creditors call to say if you don't pay, there'll be no more shipments. With no shipments, there's no merchandise to create sales, which drop further. Once the downward spiral starts it's very difficult to stop it.&quot;    Joe Loddo, president of Instinct Sportswear Inc. in Alexandria, Va., was frustrated with late financial reports from his outside auditor. &quot;I brought the accounting work in house,&quot; he says. &quot;You need fast reports to make good management decisions.&quot;    To help owners take the financial pulse of a company, Ronald Torrence, a small-business consultant in Great Falls, Va., has designed a test of business health for small firms. A work sheet explaining his test accompanies this article. There's an important caveat, though: This and other tests like it depend heavily on financial ratios as indicators of a business's prospects. What these ratios don't disclose is the outlook for a company's market or the strength of its competition, factors that can either save some mismanaged companies or upend the most efficient of managers.    ---   Mr. McCarthy is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Chicago bureau.    ---                 Checking a Business's Health   By comparing their own businesses' financial ratios toindustry averages, small-business owners can gauge theircompanies' health.   The following test, created by small-business consultantRonald Torrence, checks profitability, liquidity andfinancial position. If just one of these three areas isstrong enough, it likely can carry the other two: The sort offinancial deterioration that leads to failure usually showsup in all three areas simultaneously.   A small-business owner interested in seeing how a businessmeasures up needs to get average industry figures for eachline item; these often can be obtained through a trade group,banker, accountant or local small-business developmentcenter. Also, as an example of how the tests can be applied,Mr. Torrence has calculated the results of an East Coastsupply company over a three year period.

But 1986pre-tax profit was almost erased by climbing general andadministrative expenses. &quot;The red flag is up,&quot; says Mr.Torrence. &quot;The company must cut those costs.&quot;                                                    Latest                                   Your Data        Industry                             1984    1985    1986   Average    Profitability    Begin at 100%            100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%    Cost of goods sold    divided by sales    Gross profit divided    by sales    General and    administrative costs    divided by sales    Other expenses    (including interest    expense) divided by sales    Pre-tax profit divided    by sales   For your company, compare the gross profit ratio withcompany goals and the industry percentage. Is it stable, upor down? Look at the general and administrative costs ratio.Is it eating up too much gross profit? How does it comparewith the industry percentage?

Inventory turnover is close to the industryaverage, but the current ratio has dropped.   *To determine a company's receivables collection rate,divide annual sales by 365 to get the average daily salesfigure.

The equity/totalassets percentage was closing in on the industry average in1985 but fell back in 1986 -- pummeled by lower profits andhigher liabilities. Trouble looms. The company must post astrong profit this year and improve its receivablescollection.

A company is on dangerous ground if the totaldebt ratio exceeds 75%. An equity/total assets ratio of 35%or higher is good. To qualify for most bank loans, adebt-to-worth ratio of 3-to-1 or lower is acceptable.   Used with permission of Ronald Torrence.</TEXT></DOC>
