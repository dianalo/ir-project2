Manuel Antonio Noriega.   At least six of the larger Latin American countries have noambassador stationed in Panama. But U.S. officials say some havebeen ambiguous about the reasons for not being represented.   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis, a political appointee, left Panamain May and President Bush said Friday that there are no plans tosend him back.   Bush said no diplomatic contacts are planned with the newgovernment headed by President Francisco Rodriguez, a friend ofNoriega since high school who served as government comptroller forseven years. Noriega will continue to serve as the behind-the-scenespower in Panama.   Among the larger Latin American democracies, only Mexico andEcuador have ambassadors in Panama, officials said. Among those notrepresented at that level are Venezuela, Peru, Uruguay, Colombia,Brazil, Chile and Argentina.   The officials, insisting on anonymity, left open the possibilitythat the recall of one or more of the ambassadors from thesecountries was unrelated to political developments in Panama.   The administration on Friday used the occasion of the appointmentof an unelected president in Panama to intensify its campaignagainst Noriega.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler spoke disdainfullyof Rodriguez, who was named to replace his handpicked predecessor,President Manuel Solis Palma.   ``Noriega's latest puppet president is an unknown within Panama,with no political following, whose chief qualification for theposition seems to have been his longtime friendship with Noriega andhis slavish loyalty to the dictator,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   ``Noriega's naming of a so-called `provisional government' iscompletely outside Panama's constitution, and is, in effect, athinly disguised coup d'etat.''   An elected president was to have taken office Friday butPanamanian authorities threw out the results of the May 7 nationalelections. The State Department has said an honest count would haveshown that the anti-Noriega candidate won by a 3-1 margin.   ``This should have been a proud day for Panamanians and for allwho believe in self-determination and democracy,'' Bush said in astatement. ``Instead, it is a sad day _ a sad day for Panama and forthe democratic nations of this hemisphere.''   No new economic sanctions were announced by the administration,but officials are studying the possibility of tightening sanctionsimposed against Panama last year.</TEXT></DOC>
