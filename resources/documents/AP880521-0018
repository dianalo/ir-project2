Command charged today thatNorth Korea of scheming to disrupt the Olympic Games in Seoul withfalse claims that war could break out on the divided Koreanpeninsula.   U.S. Rear Adm. William Pendley told a news conference thatcommunist North Korea is trying to stir up tension to scare othernations away from the Olympics.   ``Although the north wants the world to believe the DMZ(Demilitarized Zone) is aflame and war is imminent, that is justnot the case at all,'' said Pendley, a senior official of theUnited Nations Command.   Pendley said North Korea has made a barrage of false claims inrecent months, accusing U.S. and South Korean forces of preparingfor war and opening fire with artillery and machine guns on theborder.   All the North Korean charges have been investigated and nonewere substantiated, Pendley said. He said they were clearlypropaganda and lies to undermine the Olympic Games, scheduled forSept. 17 to Oct. 2.   ``North Korea would like to scare off Olympic teams and fans,''he said.   The Olympics have become a major symbol in the bitter strugglebetween the two Koreas. The south sees the games as proof of how ithas outstripped the north in almost every field.   Pendley said the U.N. Command is making every effort to preservestability on the border and avoid confrontation with the north.Peace is vital to ensure the safety of the Olympics, he said.   North Korea has said it will boycott the games because SouthKorea and the International Olympic Commmittee rejected its demandto co-host the event. South Korea has offered to let the northstage up to five Olympic events.   On Friday, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung proposed that SouthKorea and North Korea hold talks on co-hosting the games.   He said such an arrangement would benefit the south by ensuringthe security of the Olympics and forcing north to open its closedsociety, promoting chances of national unification.   But today, Kim retracted the call, saying ``I have no intentionof carrying my point alone if other parties oppose it.''   The idea had invited immediate opposition from the government,which denounced it as ``a irresponsible political maneuvering''that would help the north disrupt the Olympics.   Pendley said he was confident the Olympics would be a successand the participation of 161 nations, including North Korea'scommunist allies, should discourage any provocation by the North.   The adminiral represents the U.N. Command delegation at meetingswith North Korean and Chinese delegates under the MilitaryArmistice Commission.   The commission polices the cease-fire that ended the Korean War,which ended in 1953, three years after beginning when the northinvaded the south.   About 42,000 U.S. troops are based in the south as part of amutual defense pact against the north. The U.N. Command consists ofthe United States, South Korea and other nations that foughtagainst the north.   In reply to a question, Pendley said there were no unusual NorthKorean military movements to indicate they expected trouble or werepreparing for war.   But South Korean and U.S. forces based in the South would takeevery security precaution to guard the games, Pendley said. `   `You can never be assured as to what the north will do,'' hesaid.   South Korea, the United States, Japan and dozens of othernations contend North Korea was responsible for the Nov. 29 bombingof a South Korean airliner that killed all 115 people on board.   A woman, who said she was a North Korean agent, said she hadbombed the plane as part of efforts to disrupt the Olympics.</TEXT></DOC>
