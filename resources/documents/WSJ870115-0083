The computer maker's second-quarter results exceeded analysts expectations and provided strong evidence that its star is rising while that of many competitors, particularly International Business Machines Corp., have lost luster. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Digital soared to a high of $130 a share, up $11.50.    Digital's second-quarter earnings &quot;confirm that DEC's roll will probably be longer than people expected,&quot; said Tom Rooney, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc. &quot;It will probably last at least another couple of quarters.&quot;    In the quarter, Digital earned $270 million, or $2.02 a share, compared with $136.1 million, or $1.08 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 22% to $2.27 billion from $1.86 billion.    Analysts agreed that Digital's pre-tax profit margin, which was 18.7% for the quarter, played a central role in its strong earnings. &quot;It appears that DEC's margins have surpassed IBM's for the first time ever,&quot; said Stephen Smith, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. IBM is expected next week to report lower earnings for its fourth quarter. In the year-earlier second quarter, Digital had a pre-tax profit margin of 9.9%.    Digital's higher margin stemmed largely from the increasing proportion of recently introduced computers in its product mix, analysts said. &quot;About 85% of DEC's product line is less than 18 months old,&quot; said Michael Geran, an analyst with E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.    During 1986, Digital shifted to a new generation of computers that have lower manufacturing costs and higher profit margins. Moreover, the company has been making more of its sales directly to companies that use its machines rather than to companies that buy quantities of computers at discounts and resell them, said Marc Schulman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.    Sales of mid-range and large VAX computers were &quot;particularly&quot; strong during the quarter, Kenneth Olsen, Digital's president, said. The company continued to gain market share in financial services and telecommunications markets, he added.    In the quarter, service and other revenue rose 36% and product sales rose 16% from a year earlier, Digital said. The company's orders rose 30% to 35% during the second quarter, analysts said. &quot;That's a very considerable rise,&quot; said Salomon Brothers' Mr. Schulman. &quot;Last quarter, orders rose about 20% to 25%.&quot;    Digital added 3,000 employees during the quarter and now employs about 101,000 world-wide, a company spokesman said. Many of the new employees are sales and service workers, he added.    Analysts had expected Digital to earn $1.70 to $1.80 a share in the second quarter. Following announcement of its unexpectedly high second-quarter earnings, many of them increased their earnings projections for fiscal 1987 to about $8 a share from about $7 a share. In fiscal 1986, Digital earned $617.4 million, or $4.81 a share.    Analysts agreed, however, that Digital's quarterly earnings probably won't continue to double compared with year-earlier results, as they have during the past few quarters. &quot;We're reaching the point where DEC's margin expansion will begin to slow,&quot; said Mr. Schulman. &quot;But there will continue to be some improvement because of the continuing shift to high-end systems with high margins.&quot;    In the six months ended Dec. 27, Digital's profit more than doubled to $452.6 million, or $3.39 a share, from $208.4 million, or $1.68 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 24% to $4.31 billion from $3.49 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
