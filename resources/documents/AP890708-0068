The bill, created in an attempt to slow the record murder rateand drug-related crime wave in the nation's capital, is the first ofits kind in the nation. It would allow relatives of shooting andmurder victims to sue the manufacturer and dealer of the weapon.   A final vote on the legislation will be held Tuesday. If passed,it must be reviewed by Congress, which has ultimate legislativeauthority over the district.   ``I don't think Congress will allow the bill to become law,''said Richard Gardner, state and local affairs director at theNational Rifle Association. ``The bill places an extreme limitationon interstate commerce, and the federal government is the only bodythat can regulate interstate commerce.''   Since the district's strict 1976 handgun ordinance bans the saleor manufacture of weapons in the nation's capital, the law couldonly be applied to manufacturers in other states, Gardner said.   ``It's going to be tough up there,'' conceded council chairmanDavid Clarke, one of the bill's sponsors. ``I wouldn't evenundertake it if I didn't believe so strongly that the legislationwould help.''   Speaking at a public hearing on the bill held last month, D.C.Corporation Counsel Frederick Cooke also said the bill might violateinterstate commerce provisions protected by the Constitution.   However, Clarke argued that plenty of legal precedent exists forsuch a bill.   ``Strict liability laws exist in many states and have not beenheld to infringe on interstate commerce,'' Clarke said. ``Somestates regulate dynamite, other states liquor _ the newness here isthe application to handguns.''   The bill passed by an 8-4 margin in a preliminary vote held twoweeks ago.   However, at least one House member is planning to fight the billif it pases the council.   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a frequent critic of the districtgovernment, is expected to try to block the legislation when itreaches the House. Last month, Parris likened the bill to an attempt``to hold Black and Decker responsible for the Texas ChainsawMassacre.''   Parris was on vacation and unavailable for comment Friday, hisoffice said.   Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., a member of the House AppropriationsDistrict of Columbia subcommittee, is being pressured by the NRA tooppose the measure, but Carr aides said he is unlikely to introducelegislation to scuttle the city law.   The NRA is also asking other members to oppose the bill, Gardnersaid.   City officials have said extra police _ and stricter handgunlegislation _ are needed to stem the murder rate. Through Friday,225 people have been killed in Washington in 1989, compared with 153at that time last year. In 1988, a record 372 people were killed.   Police blame more than 60 percent of these slayings on drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
