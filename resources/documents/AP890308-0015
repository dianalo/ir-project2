Poor communication wrecks most marriages, 77 of the Americanwomen said in the survey. They ranked alcoholism second, while 39percent of Soviet women ranked parental interference second.   The survey, based on an unscientific sampling, was conducted byWoman's Day, a U.S. magazine geared toward suburban women, andKrestyanka, a Soviet magazine whose name translates as, ``PeasantWoman,'' although 54 percent of its respondents identifiedthemselves as white-collar.   ``This survey reveals there's nothing foreign about domesticdifficulties,'' said Ellen R. Levine, Woman's Day editor in chief.   ``Soviet and American women have more in common than they mayhave thought: too much work, troubled marriages, husbands who won'thelp, and alcoholism.''   ``Stress is the great equalizer,'' said Ethel Klein, associateprofessor of political science at Columbia University, whointerpreted the poll for Woman's Day. ``Women have hit a strongstress point in both societies.''   Fifty-six percent of the Soviet women surveyed said an idealhusband should be faithful and a good head of the family. More than63 percent of American women mentioned ``communicative,''``emotionally supportive'' and ``faithful'' as the virtues of theideal husband.   Only 2 percent of American women thought good homemaking skillsmake an ideal husband. Still, 61 percent said American men mustassume more responsibility for housework and 50 percent wanted mento help more with child care. Twenty percent of the Soviet womensaid men should do more at home and 13 percent said men should spendmore time raising their kids.   The surveys were conducted by mail so that rural Soviet womenwithout phones could be included. Women's Day received about 30,000responses from women with a median age of 41; more thanthree-quarters are married and almost 90 percent have children.Krestyanka got back about 200,000 responses, with a median age of30, three-fourths married and 78 percent with children.   The Yankelovich Clancy Shulman polling firm tabulated the Woman'sDay results.</TEXT></DOC>
