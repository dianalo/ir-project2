Some key elements were still being debated last night, and may not be resolved for several more weeks. During intense negotiations in recent days, most of the scores of provisions the White House considered unacceptable in the 1,000-page bill were dropped, watered down, or made subject to presidential waiver. But the conferees approved two provisions the administration has said could prompt a veto: One would require that workers receive advance notice of plant closings and another would punish Japan's Toshiba Corp. for illegal sales to the Soviet Union.    Late last night, conferees agreed to require the administration to begin investigations against countries that maintain &quot;numerous and pervasive&quot; unfair trade barriers. But they would give the administration some discretion in deciding whether to retaliate and how. They dropped the controversial amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) that would have directed the president to move against countries that have huge trade surpluses with the U.S.    The lawmakers also agreed to establish a new standard for determining whether domestic industries battered by imports should receive relief. And they agreed to give the president the discretion to provide the relief in ways other than imposing tariffs or quotas on the offending imports.    And the conferees agreed to repeal the windfall profits tax on domestically produced crude oil.    About 200 conferees, divided into 17 working groups, worked at a fast and furious pace all week to wrap up the House-Senate conference, reaching agreement on some of the most controversial issues yesterday. But while the conferees finished a big chunk of the trade legislation, they won't make a final decision on the entire package until they return in mid-April from the congressional Easter recess.    In the meantime, top congressional negotiators could make minor modifications to sections they already have settled, and they also could decide to drop entire provisions that the Reagan administration vehemently opposes to avoid a presidential veto.    The trade negotiators want to put their agreements in writing to give to the administration for its review. After the recess, congressional leaders will seek the administration's reaction to the entire package before it sends the package to the president.    If administration officials indicate that the package is acceptable except for the controversial plant-closing and Toshiba provisions, the conferees will consider dropping them to win presidential approval. But if the administration has so many objections to the legislation that a veto appears unavoidable, Congress is more likely to send the entire package -- including the objectionable provisions -- and then try to override a veto.    Administration officials decided to soft-pedal the veto threat in public yesterday, to preserve the possibility they could still knock out the plant closing, and possibly other provisions in the final talks later this month.    &quot;I think we're hopeful,&quot; White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday. &quot;There's still a possibility we'll get a bill we can sign.&quot; Regarding the plant closing and mandatory retaliation measures, he said &quot;there's still a possibility those will be worked out.&quot; He concluded: &quot;We want a bill,&quot; but added, &quot;It could go either way.&quot;    House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) said failure to wrap up the conference this week wouldn't be &quot;fatal&quot; and said the presidential veto would be &quot;foolish.&quot; He added that Congress wouldn't &quot;let the White House write the bill.&quot;    But privately, while administration trade officials were careful not to commit the president in advance, they made it clear that in addition to the plant closings measure, anything that would force the president to retaliate in trade cases would probably prompt a veto.    The key person in deciding on a veto strategy will be Treasury Secretary James Baker. A shrewd politician, he will have to juggle the domestic benefits of appearing to be tough on unfair trade against a possible harsh reaction among trading partners, foreign investors and world financial market participants to any bill they might deem protectionist -- even if the details of the bill don't support that conclusion.    Mr. Baker personally is determined to avoid even the appearance that the president might be signing the modern equivalent of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930, which many blame for the Great Depression. Moreover, he worries that any effort to curb imports could invite retaliation against the new U.S. export drive. And he doesn't want to risk a plunge in the dollar or a flight from the U.S. by foreign investors, even if they are reacting merely to the symbolism of the president signing a trade bill.    While the Treasury secretary is known to believe a veto might be necessary, it isn't clear that the administration can sustain a veto of a bill that has already been watered down in numerous ways. And there are election-year dangers for the Republican party if the White House appears to be brushing off widespread public concerns about trade by rebuffing a bill Congress was willing to weaken for the president.    In Congress, the top trade negotiators, House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D. Ill.) and Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D. Texas), want a trade bill that will become law rather than a political vehicle in an election year. They have sought the opinions of administration officials, but they say they will fight for a substantive rather than symbolic piece of legislation.    Administration trade officials say that even if the big issues are ironed out, there are a number of &quot;marginal&quot; provisions already included that continue to make them uneasy, such as one that would have the Treasury study the idea of a special agency to buy up Third World debt. The officials say that the administration could decide that there are so many of these small problems that they constitute a &quot;critical mass&quot; justifying a veto.    Among other top administration officials, the president's chief economic adviser, Beryl Sprinkel, and Budget Director James Miller are said to be steadfastly opposed to any bill. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and Commerce Secretary William Verity favor seeking some compromise, though both oppose the plant closings and mandatory retaliation measures.    &quot;In the end, we'll get a bill the president can sign,&quot; predicted Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.). &quot;Whether we have to go through a veto first, I don't know.&quot;    Here are the major provisions of the trade bill that have been cleared so far by working groups of House and Senate conferees. These provisions are still subject to review by leaders of the full House-Senate conference, and to a final vote in both houses, before being sent to President Reagan.    Toshiba Sanctions   The conferees, bending to administration pressure, agreed to lighten the trade sanctions that the Senate had aimed at Toshiba Corp. to punish the Japanese industrial giant for the export-control violations by a subsidiary.    They voted to penalize the parent with a three-year ban on doing business with U.S. government agencies, but scrapped the Senate-approved two- to five-year ban on imports from the Toshiba group. The bill, however, would ban all imports from the subsidiary, Toshiba Machine Co., for three years as the Senate bill generally intended.    The compromise left most of the principals mildly disappointed. Toshiba would save most of its U.S. sales of about $2.5 billion a year, but its subsidiary could lose as much as $300 million over that three-year period, according to legislative estimates.    Moreover, Japanese officials worry that the bill could threaten allied harmony by inflicting penalties on foreign companies that haven't violated any U.S. laws. The officials say the milling machines sold to the Soviets for use in manufacturing submarines were entirely of Japanese origin and that Japan should be responsible for any enforcement of the export-control violations, as the U.S. and other allied countries have agreed.    There was no evident cheer in the Reagan administration, which has threatened to veto the entire trade bill if it retained the tough Senate sanctions. &quot;We can't say anything until we see the final text,&quot; a Commerce Department official said.    The bill also prescribes sanctions for foreign companies that commit similar violations in the future. Companies that &quot;knowingly&quot; breach export-control rules could be subject to a two- to five-year ban on U.S. sales and federal contracting. However, parents of subsidiaries guilty of these violations could be exempted from these sanctions if their governments have a good record of enforcing these controls and if the parents maintain effective interal controls.    Rep. Duncan Hunter (R., Calif.), an advocate of strong sanctions against Toshiba, said he will look for another legislative vehicle to exact more compensation for the strategic losses caused by Toshiba Machine's improper sales.    The bill could exempt some federal agencies from observing the ban if they have previous business contracts with Toshiba or if the Toshiba group is the only source of important spare parts.    Unfair Trade Practices   The administration would be required to begin investigations into countries that maintain &quot;numerous and pervasive&quot; unfair trade barriers. The authority to initiate such &quot;301&quot; cases would be transferred to the U.S. trade representative from the president, as would the formal authority to order retaliation. The conferees, however, noted that the trade representative serves at the direction of the president, and would be unlikely to take action he opposes. Nevertheless, the administration objects to the proposed transfer of authority.    Securities Dealers   The legislation would bar foreign companies from serving as primary dealers in U.S. government securities unless their governments allow U.S. firms to compete on an equal footing with local firms to handle their government securities.    The measure is aimed primarily at Japan, and it was approved over strong protests from the Treasury Department, which said the administration should have discretion over imposing sanctions. If enacted, the measure essentially would force three big Japanese securities firms out of the lucrative business of being primary dealers in U.S. government securities -- if Japan doesn't offer U.S. companies within one year the &quot;same competitive opportunities&quot; Japanese firms enjoy for dealing in that country's government securities.    The primary-dealer provision was sponsored by Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.). In its original form, it would have given foreign countries only six months to authorize U.S. companies to serve as primary dealers in their securities or see their companies lose primary-dealer status here. But conferees agreed to extend the period to one year.    The Japanese primary dealers that could be affected by the provision are Nomura Securities International Inc., Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. and Daiwa Securities America Inc. The provision would exempt primary dealers owned by, or being acquired by, Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd., and Long Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. It also would exempt First Boston Corp., in which Credit Suisse has a major holding.    Primary dealers are elite institutions that deal directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when it buys and sells government securities as part of its open-market operations. Some large institutional investors will do business only with primary dealers.    Intellectual Property   The trade bill would direct presidential action against countries that permit piracy of U.S. &quot;intellectual property.&quot; It would require the president to identify countries that don't protect copyrights and patents, and to initiate expedited unfair-trade investigations in the most egregious cases. The president could decline to move against certain countries if doing so would be against the national economic interest, though. Congress wants speedy action because time often can be critical in winning protection for certain intellectual property, such as computer software, which can be copied rapidly.    In addition, holders of patents on processes by which products are made, as in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, would be allowed to sue U.S. importers of any products that use their patented processes in a foreign country where the patents aren't protected. Currently, patent-process holders can seek to prevent such products from coming into the U.S., but can't recover damages from the unfair competition.    Another provision would eliminate a requirement that U.S. patentholders prove they are injured before they can obtain government orders banning imports of products that infringe their patents.    Plant Closings   Employers would generally be required to give workers 60 days advance notice if plants are to be closed either to consolidate work forces or to relocate work.    President Reagan has repeatedly said he would veto any trade bill containing the notification provision. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, however, said he hopes the full House-Senate conference will drop the measure before sending the bill to the president. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), the Senate's top trade negotiator, said the provision could possibly be dropped, but that this depends on whether Congress &quot;would have enough votes to override&quot; a veto.    Business has complained that notifying employees would hasten closings by driving away customers or creditors.    The notification requirement would affect companies with more than 100 employees, but would exempt &quot;faltering&quot; companies working to avert a closing. It would require employers to give workers back pay for each day of notice not given, to a maximum of 60 days' wages.    It would also require the employer to pay the local government where the plant is situated a penalty of as much as $500 a day for each day of notice not given, but employers could be relieved of the penalty if they pay employees within two weeks or at the end of a pay period after the plant shutdown.    The measure includes exemptions for plant closings caused by the sale of the business, relocations within a community, closings of temporary facilities or completions of particular projects. The notification provision also makes a distinction between a layoff and a plant closing. It wouldn't require advance notice for a layoff unless it involved at least one-third of an employer's work force and that portion had at least 50 employees. Notice would be required if 500 or more employees were laid off even if they didn't constitute one-third of the work force.    Worker Retraining   One section would authorize $980 million for a massive worker-retraining program that is supported by the Reagan administration and Congress. Workers displaced by plant closings or modernization would be eligible for retraining, even if their job losses didn't result from imports.    The program is designed to provide federal and state services that emphasize retraining. The program would give 80% of the money to the states. In order to receive the funding, each state would be directed to set up a strike force that would go quickly to work sites where large job losses are expected. At a work site, the task force would set up worker-management committees, and take steps to accelerate the readjustment process, psychologically and logistically, before a plant is closed. The state also would provide training and adjustment services.    The remaining 20% of the funds would be used for discretionary grants to help states that don't have enough funds to handle the unpredictablity of plant closures.    The legislation also would expand the assistance programs for workers displaced by imports. It attempts to move from the current cash-benefits program to one of promoting adjustment by making enrollment in retraining programs a condition of receiving benefits. Benefits would be paid for by a small import fee taking effect two years after enactment of the law, unless the president repealed the fee.    Import Relief   There would be several key changes governing when the federal government provides relief to domestic industries battered by imports. Industries that currently can qualify for relief merely by showing they are seriously injured by increasing imports would, under the trade bill, also have to show that they are prepared to make a &quot;positive adjustment&quot; to import competition. This would mean that a dying industry couldn't win relief unless it demonstrated it could become competitive again.    The conferees, making a significant concession to the Reagan administration, agreed to give the administration some discretion in deciding when to grant import relief. Earlier versions would have required the administration to take action once substantial injury was found. In a change yesterday, the legislation wouldn't force the administration to act if &quot;for example, any action would result in greater economic and social costs than benefits,&quot; according to the agreement.    Windfall Profits   The legislation would repeal the windfall profits tax on domestically produced crude oil. The tax was designed to capture for the government some of the profits generated when controls were lifted from soaring oil prices in 1980. Sen. Bentsen said that repeal, which he advocated, wouldn't result in any lost revenue for the government, because oil prices are currently below the level at which companies have to pay anything.    Telecommunications   The president would be required to negotiate with foreign countries to gain greater access to their markets for U.S. makers of telecommunications products and equipment. The provision directs the president to use as leverage in such talks the threat that foreign companies' access to the U.S. telecommunications market could be denied if foreign governments don't reduce barriers to entry by U.S. companies into their markets.    Third World Debt   The bill directs the secretary of the Treasury to open discussions with other countries on the possibility of creating a special &quot;debt facility&quot; -- an entity that could purchase Third World debt, swap it, convert it into securities or otherwise act to reduce the debtor countries' debt load. However, the legislation gives the secretary an escape clause by which he can avoid holding such talks; Treasury Secretary James Baker, who opposes a debt facility strongly, is expected to use that mechanism.    Before talks are to be opened, an interim study of the question is to be performed. The secretary needn't hold the debt facility talks if the study concludes that such talks would carry a &quot;material risk&quot; of reducing the value of the debt, disrupting debt service, or causing defaults. Mr. Baker and his aides are already convinced that any legitimization of the debt facility idea would, indeed, lead to declining value of the debt, to defaults and to disruption of interest payments.    Thus, the interim study, to be done within six months of passage, is almost certain to come out against holding the talks. But Congress, aware of Mr. Baker's views, also called for a final study within 12 months of the bill's passage, when a new president will be in office. How that study would turn out is much less certain.    As passed by the House, the bill flatly would have required negotiations, with no study and no escape clause. The White House felt it could live with the provision if the study was included and it could control the study. It isn't known whether the second, final study by a new administration will make the idea unacceptable to the White House.    The bill also would require the U.S. to ask the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to do new studies examining all the proposed debt-problem solutions.    Export Controls   The conferees voted to abolish controls on the export of many widely available electronics products to Japan and 14 NATO allies. Since these products, which include personal computers, are subject only to routine licensing, decontrolling this category would reduce paper work and improve delivery times.    The bill also would clarify the Pentagon's role in reviewing licenses for exports to non-socialist countries, stating that the review should be done only for &quot;national security&quot; reasons. Some members of Congress have complained that the Pentagon sometimes blocks U.S. exports on foreignpolicy grounds that go beyond its legislative mandate.    The conferees agreed to limit the export of petroleum products refined in new Alaskan facilities to 50% of their output, or no more than 70,000 barrels a day. It wouldn't disturb any existing Alaskan export transactions. The bill would exempt refined products destined for U.S. airlines and U.S. military buyers from the cap and guarantees Canada daily supplies of 50,000 barrels.    Exchange Rates   The bill would put into legislative language current U.S. policies on exchange rates and international economic policy coordination.    It would require the U.S. to hold multilateral talks with other major nations to improve both coordination of economic policies and existing mechanisms for stabilizing exchange rates. In addition, the U.S. would be required to hold talks on exchange rates with any country that runs trade surpluses with the U.S. and the world, and that the U.S. believes is manipulating its exchange rates. Annual reports to Congress would be required on how the two types of talks are going.    The U.S. already holds regular talks with the six other major industrial countries on policy coordination and currency stability. And the U.S. already has held heated talks with the East Asian trade powers -- South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong -- it contends have manipulated their currencies.    Earlier provisions that would have required the U.S. to set a &quot;competitive&quot; dollar exchange rate and support it with intervention were dropped in conference after talks with the administration.    Scientific Exchanges   In a move clearly aimed at Japan, one provision nearing completion would increase pressure for reciprocity in scientific exchanges with other countries. It would provide that agreements establishing such exchanges be negotiated through an interagency process instead of through the State Department, as often has been the case. The interagency format would encourage the government to consider trade and other economic issues in drafting such accords.    The provision was prompted partly by the delays in renewing a U.S.-Japan science and technology agreement. There are five Japanese scientists working or studying in the U.S. for every one American counterpart in Japan.    At the Reagan administration's urging, the conferees didn't make the principle of symmetry legally binding.    The section nearing completion also would expand the mission of the National Bureau of Standards and rename it the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In addition to retaining its historic role of setting measurement standards, the office would be encouraged to work on leading-edge technologies such as superconductivity, biotechnology, and advanced composite materials.    The Commerce Department would be instructed to feed the unclassified output of nearly 700 federal laboratories to potential commercial users and to create a clearinghouse for local governments and research institutions to exchange innovative ideas. The bill would encourage joint research by groups of companies, but it would leave the extent to which such collaboration can be exempt from antitrust laws to future legislation.    The bill also would beef up the National Critical Materials Council, an office created in 1984 to monitor the effects of various federal policies -- including those involving trade and the environment -- on the mining industry. The council deals with technology-related materials such as superconductive elements and advanced ceramics as well as traditional metals like gold, copper and iron.    Foreign Takeovers   To head off broader regulation of foreign investment in the U.S., the administration agreed to a provision granting the president the power to block foreign investments that impair U.S. national security.    The measure is the first concrete legislative response to rising concern in the U.S. about foreign takeovers, and it gives the White House a direct way to halt foreign takeovers if it chooses. But it is limited to national security cases; earlier congressional language permitting takeovers to be blocked to protect &quot;essential commerce&quot; was dropped to win administration support. In the national security area, current law already provides for a set of reviews and procedures that have managed to head off or alter proposed foreign acquisitions even without presidential power.    Under the bill, the president could act only if existing review procedures show that an acquisition threatens national security and if the current procedures couldn't derail or reshape the acquisition. Further, the president could block an acquisition only if no other law -- including antitrust, environmental and defense procurement acts -- would stop it. And the president would have to cite credible evidence that the foreign party involved was likely to take action that would impair national security.    Reagan administration officials believe the new power would be used very rarely, and that the conditions set out in the bill would make it hard for future presidents to use a broad definition of &quot;national security&quot; in justifying action against foreign takeovers. But presidents have used the term &quot;national security&quot; to justify a wide variety of actions, and the courts eventually might have to settle the bounds of presidential authority under the provision.    Agriculture   The bill would provide $2.5 billion through fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30, 1989, for the export enhancement program for agricultural products. Under the program, aimed at the European Community, the government subsidizes U.S. farm exports to countries that subsidize their own farm products.    In addition, the Agriculture Department's Foreign Agricultural Service would be strengthened.    International Consortia   The U.S. would be allowed to take action against any unfair subsidies provided by the Europeans to Airbus Industrie, a major competitor of Boeing Co. on commercial aircraft. The bill would expand coverage of U.S. trade laws to include international consortia such as Airbus.    &quot;U.S. companies can currently seek relief from unfair trade practices when their competition is subsidized by just one country, but not when the subsidies are coming from several foreign nations,&quot; said Sen. Brock Adams (D., Wash.), who sponsored the provision.    The countervailing-duty laws allow domestic manufacturers such as Boeing to ask the U.S. government to impose a duty equal to the amount of a foreign government's subsidy for a product. Airbus receives &quot;billions of dollars in subsidies&quot; from Britain, France, West Germany and Spain, according to Sen. Adams.    Dumping   The House had sought a host of major changes to make it easier to file anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases against imports, but nearly all were dropped or watered down. In the end, the bill didn't make major changes in current law in these areas.    The bill would establish as a U.S. negotiating goal in trade talks the banning of &quot;diversionary input dumping&quot; -- cases where finished products imported into the U.S. include materials that were dumped in the country where the finished goods were made. Dumping is selling a good in a foreign market at less than the home-market price or the cost of production.    The bill would authorize the Commerce Department to ask other countries to bring their own dumping cases where dumped components are used in finished products sold in the U.S. And to prevent instances in which multinational corporations can mask dumping by manipulating prices various subsidiaries charge each other, the bill would authorize the department to disregard intracompany transfer prices in figuring dumping and to use costs of production instead.    Israel was exempted from existing rules under which imports from multiple countries are combined to figure countervailing duty or dumping charges. And a method was approved for calculating whether countries with state-run economies are dumping goods in the U.S.    The Commerce Department gained new authority to halt the circumvention of earlier anti-dumping or countervailing duty orders.    Anti-Bribery Law   The 1977 law against corporate bribery of foreign officials would be revised. The legislation would clarify the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act on what kind of knowledge would make corporate officials liable for bribes made by employees or agents. It would make a U.S. company liable for employee violations if top officials ignored indications of improper actions taken on the firm's behalf.    The current anti-bribery law allows so-called grease payments to facilitate certain activities such as unloading goods on foreign docks. The trade bill would clarify permissible payments to include reasonable expenses, such as for travel and lodging, associated with selling goods overseas.    Trade Negotiations   The bill would grant the executive branch special authority to negotiate in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks now under way and expected to end in 1990. If the next president submits a new world trade pact for ratification by May 31, 1991, Congress would consider it under a &quot;fast track&quot; system that guarantees quick consideration without amendments.    The bill also would grant U.S. approval to a new agreement for harmonizing the system by which different countries categorize goods in world trade. This system is designed to make statistics more reliable.    The conferees generally would give the administration authority to slash duties as much as 50% as part of negotiations during the Uruguay round.    Competitiveness   The bill attempts to strengthen the Commerce Department's data collection by combining two of its existing data banks -- one that identifies export opportunities and another designed as a policymaking tool -- into a &quot;national trade data bank.&quot; The retooled facility could help U.S. companies compete for overseas sales.    A federal council advising Sematech, a semiconductor-producers' consortium formed with the government's blessings, would be directed to recommend ways for further supporting the venture. The project has bipartisan support because it's seen as one way to meet aggressive Japanese competition in computer chips.    In an effort to discourage the federal government from inadvertently damaging U.S. trade interests, executive agencies would be required to issue &quot;competitiveness impact statements&quot; before adopting new policies.    Small Businesses   The Small Business Administration's Office of International Trade would have increased authority and direction. The SBA would be required to prepare policy options for export-related issues affecting small business, such as expedited trade remedies.    The legislation would provide an additional $5 million in grants for export-related services to small business, including information on existing trade promotion and financing programs, translation services and trade data.    The trade bill would increase the lending limit for certain SBA loan programs to $750,000 from $500,000, and would allow for guaranteed loans of between $750,000 and $1 million for trade-oriented industries.    ---   Eduardo Lachica contributed to this article.    ---                    Trade Bill Highlights   -- Focus unfair-trade investigations on countries with consistent patterns of unfair trade practices.   -- Requires domestic companies to make &quot;positive adjustment&quot; to competition in order to win import relief.   -- Grants negotiating authority for the U.S. to complete, probably in 1990, the current Uruguay Round of world trade talks.   -- Permits the president, in certain circumstances, to block foreign takeovers if he has evidence they would impair national security.   -- Generally requires employers of 100 workers or more to give workers 60 days' notice of plant closings.   -- Bars foreign securities firms from being primary dealers in U.S. government securities unless U.S. firms gain within a year equal footing with local firms to handle their government's securities.   -- Requires negotiations with other countries to gain greater access for U.S. telecommunications equipment.   -- Gives a legal mandate for the current U.S. policy of coordinating economic policies and exchange-rate strategies with other major nations.   -- Writes into law the current U.S. practice of negotiating on exchange rates with trade-surplus countries that the U.S. charges manipulate their currencies.   -- Directs the president to initiate expedited unfair-trade actions in certain cases of foreign pirating of U.S. patents and copyrights.   -- Authorizes a $980 million new program for retraining displaced workers, and expands existing programs to help adjustment for workers who lose jobs due to imports.   -- Authorizes further agricultural export subsidies.   -- Gives the government new power to stop circumvention of existing anti-dumping or countervailing-duty orders.   -- Reduces or eliminates U.S. duties on dozens of products for which there is no U.S. source.   -- Clarify current anti-bribery law regarding business activities overseas.   -- Imposes sanctions against Japan's Toshiba Corp. for its sale of sensitive submarine technology to the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
