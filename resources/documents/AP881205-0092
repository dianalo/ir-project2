Nir, who died Wednesday, was not known as an avocado exporter. Hehad advised two Israeli prime ministers on terrorism and was linkedto the Iran-Contra deal that embarrassed the Reagan administration.   Avocado grower Carlos Garcia Mendez and a police official saidNir stayed in the best hotel, discussed avocado prices and inspectedan avocado processing plant during a three-day visit to this townnearly 200 miles west of Mexico City.   ``It was his destiny to die here,'' was the only explanationMendez could offer Sunday in an interview.   Staffers at the Hotel Real de Uruapan said Nir was traveling witha man who registered as a Lebanese and left before Nir did.   The wife of the owner of Aerotaxis of Uruapan, Marta Amezcua,said Nir and Adriana Stanton, a Canadian woman who was working foran avocado operation, chartered a small plane on Wednesday.   The Aerotaxis plane crashed near Ciudad Hidalgo, killing Nir andan airline employee and injuring Ms. Stanton and the pilot,Amezcua's son.   A security guard stands outside the room where Ms. Stanton ishospitalized in Mexico City. Ms. Stanton, who suffered leg, arm andfacial fractures, has refused to speak to reporters since Thursday,when she said she barely knew Nir.   No one can explain why Nir, who registered under his own name atthe hotel, apparently gave an assumed name when he chartered theaircraft.   Israeli officials and friends' of Nir's in Israel said he was inMexico on business, but they refused to say what the businessinvolved.   Garcia Mendez is a partner in Eupasa, a six-month old businessthat is trying to export avocados to Europe through Nucal, a Swissfirm. He said his operation grows about 500 tons of avocados a year.   Mexico has been looking for expanded export markets foragricultural products such as avocados.   Garcia Mendez said Nir dealt mostly with Pedro Curchet, anofficial of Eupasa in charge of quality control. He said Ms. Stantonwas in charge of shipping arrangements for Eupasa.   Curchet was the man who went to Ciudad Hidalgo and identifiedNir's body, according to federal judicial police commander Jose LuisArriaga. Curchet said Nir had planned to return to Uruapan in aweek, possibly to close a deal with Eupasa, according to Arriaga.   Arriaga said he had no evidence Nir's visit involved anything butavocados.   Hotel personnel said Curchet and Stanton had been in Uruapansince September, which is when the avocado harvest begins.   Eupasa employs about 50 people in its packing operation, andother avocado growers in the area recently formed a competingorganization, the Association of Producers and Exporters.   On Sunday, The Washington Post quoted Nir as saying in aninterview earlier this year that counterterrorist operations hesupervised in 1985 and 1986 with former White House aide OliverNorth were authorized by a secret agreement between the UnitedStates and Israel.   Israel denied the report. Secretary of State George Shultz, askedif such an agreement ever existed, said: ``Not that I know of.''</TEXT></DOC>
