Because demand from the former Soviet republicscollapsed, Russian smelters' prices in Western Europe havedived, depressing the market, forcing plant closuresworld-wide. EC steelmakers might file complaints againstimports of Polish, Czechoslovak and Hungarian steel products,alleging sales at unfairly low prices in the EC market,though demonstrating this in transition economies isdifficult.   European producers of nickel, chrome, lead, zinc andspecialty alloys also are feeling pressure from the cheapexports.   Western European firms worry that trade disputes mightundermine the EC's moves to open its market to the formerEast bloc. Many EC industries fear an invasion of inexpensivemanufactured goods. Eastern Europeans need hard-currencyexports to revive their economies, and often accuse the EC ofprotectionism.                                                                                                          EXPENSES IN INDUSTRIAL NATIONS                                                                                                          Finland overtook Norway as the most expensive industrialcountry, the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment found. A report by the 24 developed nations'economic forum said, for example, that in 1990, bread anddairy products in Finland cost 60% more than those inBritain. The OECD report covering 1987 through 1990 listedDenmark as the third most costly member state, followed bySweden and Japan. In 1985, Norway ranked most expensive,followed by Finland, Sweden, Denmark and the U.S.                                                                                                          PHILIPPINES' ENERGY OUTLOOK                                                                                                          The Philippines, rocked by an energy shortage that iscausing industries in the drought-hit south to close, couldbecome a significant oil producer, analysts said. An oildiscovery off Palawan could help the Philippines produce atleast 20% of its current needs of 225,000 barrels a daywithin two years. The West Linapacan field's output couldbegin commercially in May or June with at least 15,000barrels a day initially, rising to 50,000 in 1993.                                                                                                          U.S. FARM EXPORTS TO AUSTRALIA                                                                                                          U.S. farm exports to Australia last year totaled a record$236 million and were nearly double those in 1987, the U.S.Agriculture Department said. Among major exports: processedfruits and vegetables, $20 million, up 67%; tree nuts, $15million, up 36%; and dairy products, $6 million, up sixfold.&quot;A positive image for many U.S. products, relative todomestic and other foreign competitors in the Australianmarket, should help fuel continued growth,&quot; the agency said,also citing Australia's relatively high per capita income of$17,000.                                                                                                          INDIA CLEARS FOREIGN INVESTMENTS                                                                                                          India approved seven foreign investment proposals valuedat a total of $423 million, ranging from auto to yeastproduction and involving U.S., German, Swiss and Frenchfirms. This brings to 10 the projects cleared by New Delhiunder its new industrial policy. Foreign investment in India,a potential market of 844 million people, previously totaledless than $200 million a year.

TOKYO, PRETORIA REOPEN TIES                                                                                                          Japan and South Africa, which have had only consular tiessince World War II, re-established full diplomatic relations.Tokyo cited continued progress by Pretoria toward democracy.But Japanese business officials said that any big increase intrade and investment depends on political stability and thatchanges aren't expected soon. Japan lifted economic sanctionsagainst South Africa in October. Bans remain on exports ofweapons and of computers to South African agencies thatimplement apartheid.

Economists said the latest figures confirmed that Britishconsumers are retrenching and provided further support forforecasts that the recessionary economy will grow as littleas 0.5% this year.
