The negotiations, which those sources expected to beginagain in the summer depending on the outcome of the Britishnational elections, involved ATandamp;T's purchasing a big stake inCandamp;W's highly profitable Mercury Communications, the peoplesaid. Mercury competes with British Telecommunications PLCfor business voice and data traffic in Britain.</LP><TEXT>   ATandamp;T and Candamp;W also have discussed a joint venture to beowned by ATandamp;T and Mercury that would pursue business &quot;in the25 to 30 countries where markets will be opening tocompetition over the next five to six years,&quot; said oneperson.   However, the talks broke off last week before the twosides could agree on the size of ATandamp;T's stake in Mercury, thepeople said. ATandamp;T wanted at least 51% of Mercury, they said,but Candamp;W appeared unwilling to go along. Such a stake couldcost $1 billion.   Another sticking point was the political and regulatoryclimate in Britain. U.K. polls show the Labor Party beatingthe Conservatives in the next election, and this apparentlyspooked ATandamp;T, since the Conservatives have been moresupportive than Labor of competition in the U.K.telecommunications market. In addition, the U.K. Office ofTelecommunications is reviewing whether to allow BritishTelecom to cut its pricing to match rivals. With Mercurycurrently enjoying a more profitable rate structure, thiscould threaten ATandamp;T's potential investment, noted Robert B.Morris III, telecommunications analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co.   ATandamp;T and Candamp;W declined to comment on the discussions, whichhave been going on for the past few months.   ATandamp;T was so concerned about British Telecom's reaction toits becoming a direct rival of the U.K. telecommunicationsgiant that it told British Telecom executives about its planswith Mercury, the individuals said. British Telecom sharestransoceanic cables with ATandamp;T, swaps international trafficand buys equipment from ATandamp;T.   The sources couldn't say what British Telecom's immediatereaction was to ATandamp;T's plan, but the plan is not unlikeBritish Telecom's own goals in the U.S. where it operatesTymnet, one of the largest data networks. British Telecomalso plans to manage corporate networks, and it owns almost20% of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the nation'slargest cellular phone company.   Candamp;W, hungry for ATandamp;T's access to capital to fund its owninternational expansion, approached ATandamp;T in October with aplan to forge an international alliance, people close to thecompanies said.   Candamp;W offered ATandamp;T up to 20% of Mercury, giving ATandamp;T quickaccess to the U.K. market, they said. But ATandamp;T pushed forcontrol, the people said. &quot;Apparently ATandamp;T saw how it wasburned by not controlling its investments in companies suchas Sun {Microsystems} and {Italian computer maker} Olivetti,&quot;said one individual.   If a combination between the two carriers takes place,ATandamp;T's investment could top $400 million, and control ofMercury could cost $1 billion. Based on Mercury's results forthe six months ending Sept. 30, 1991, the company would haveannual revenue of $1.5 billion and about $150 million inprofits, according to Jack B. Grubman, telecommunicationsanalyst at PaineWebber Inc. Mercury's operating profit in theperiod grew 38% to $121 million. He said a &quot;reasonable&quot;public valuation of Mercury would be 14 to 15 times earnings,similar to MCI Communications Corp. of the U.S. That wouldgive Mercury a value of about $2.1 billion, he said, making a20% stake worth about $420 million.   ATandamp;T's desire for global expansion has been no secret. Itsacquisition of NCR Corp. expanded its revenue to about $44billion, and contributes to its goal of garnering 20% to 25%of its revenue from overseas by 1995. &quot;ATandamp;T agrees with BT'svision that there will be four or five global phone companiesafter the year 2000, each providing voice and data servicesto corporations on a global basis,&quot; Mr. Morris said.   Candamp;W cut its teeth in the international market more than100 years ago by setting up phone companies throughout theformer British Empire. Its holdings include Hong KongTelecommunications and phone companies in the Caribbean, andit is building a &quot;global digital highway&quot; of underseafiber-optic cables and satellites -- a tack not unlikeATandamp;T's.</TEXT></DOC>
