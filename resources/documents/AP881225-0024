Walid Khaled of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council did not set adate for the release of Marie-Laure, 7, and Virginie, 6.   The group said they will be freed in response to appeals fromLibyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, chief backer of the organizationheaded by terrorist leader Abu Nidal.   Khaled showed a news conference videotapes of people capturedwith the girls, their mother Jacqueline Valente and five Belgians.They apparently will remain held.   ``The decision to free them is basically related to theresponsibility of the French (government),'' Khaled said withoutelaborating.   On tape, all the captives said they were well cared for.   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council declared Nov. 8, 1987, it hadseized them aboard a French yacht off the Gaza Strip and accusedthem of spying for Israel.   However, Israeli press reports said the yacht was hijacked offLibya, the group's main base.   ``We will release the two girls as a Christmas gift for thechildren of the world and their family,'' Khaled told reporters athis office in west Beirut's Mar Elias Palestinian refugee camp.   ``They will be released outside Lebanon. That's why the operationis taking time,'' Khaled added.   That raised the possibility they could be freed in Libya orAlgeria, which has offered to host the release.   Khaled said the other captives were ``in good health and welltreated.''   The Belgians are Fernand Houtekins, his brother Emmanuel and hiswife Godelieve and their two children, Laurent, 17, and Valerie, 16.   In the tapes, the six said they were filmed Dec. 20. They startedby giving their names and wishing Merry Christmas and Happy New Yearto relatives and friends. They did not relay any demands of theirkidnappers.   ``I'm pregnant and in good health. After our release, I intend tolive in another country than France to build up my future there,''Ms. Valente said.   Fernand Houtekins referred to Ms. Valente as ``my wife.''   ``For the second time, my wife is pregnant while we are with thePalestinian fighters. Everything is proceeding smoothly,'' he said.   Khaled said last Christmas that Ms. Valente had given birth to ababy girl after a seven-month pregnancy ``from an illegalrelationship with Fernand Houtekins.''   Emmanuel Houtekins said the kidnappers were ``providing us withwine and beer. Our accommodation is good and we have heating. Wehave no problems.''   Mrs. Godelieve Houtekins thanked the Belgian government ``for allthe help exerted to facilitate our release.''   Valerie Houtekins said she hoped to ``receive letters fromrelatives and friends soon.''   Her brother, Laurent, revealed ``we are all at the same bigapartment.''   The videotapes were released after Khaled met for an hour withMs. Valente's mother, Brigitte Valente, her former husband PascalBetille and brother-in-law Andre Metral, who are in Beirut tonegotiate the release.</TEXT></DOC>
