In the final 48 hours of his campaign, the Massachusetts governor flew virtually round-the-clock, arriving in a gray dawn at Cleveland yesterday to rally auto workers before network cameras. To the tune of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; he was greeted at the St. Louis airport hours later, and after rallies here and in Los Angeles, he flew into the night again with scheduled stops in Iowa and Michigan before arriving in Boston this morning.    &quot;We took the red-eye to be with the Buckeyes,&quot; the presidential candidate told workers in Cleveland, &quot;and to ask you one question. Is Ohio going to let the pollsters and pundits decide this election, or are you going to send a message that can be heard all the way from California to Kennebunkport?&quot;    The strain showed at a massive rally that drew at least 15,000 people here, and Mr. Dukakis fell back on feisty phrases instead of the more personal populism that has lifted his campaign in recent weeks. &quot;George Bush's handlers say they have a lock on California,&quot; he said. &quot;I think California is going to lock George Bush right out of the White House.&quot;    The overnight raid into the Midwest took time and energy from the last day in California. But the sense of fighting back is important in itself, as the campaign resists the notion that the political landscape is already frozen against Mr. Dukakis. &quot;The race is very dynamic,&quot; said Kirk O'Donnell, a senior adviser to the governor. &quot;We want to sustain our momentum in these last days.&quot;    Al Butcher, a 31-year-old Ohio auto worker who supported Ronald Reagan four years ago, is a typical target. Still undecided, he respects Mr. Bush's foreign-policy background but turned out to hear Mr. Dukakis's commitment to working families at home. &quot;I was pretty impressed,&quot; he said after the rally. &quot;I'm going to sleep on it.&quot;    The grueling pace of the final days tops a week of campaigning demonstrating both the strengths and the weaknesses of Mr. Dukakis after 20 months in pursuit of the presidency. He has proved a more able candidate than when he first began last year, but his reserve still frustrates those who would like to see him succeed. He was slow in Chicago to invite the Rev. Jesse Jackson to share in the applause of his home city, and in New York, Mr. Dukakis appeared to brush aside Gov. Mario Cuomo when the New York governor sought to raise their arms together in a victory salute.    The crowds have been large and energetic, but the impression is often that Mr. Dukakis has been more successful in reviving Democratic spirits these last weeks than in undermining Mr. Bush's base. Like yesterday's appearance in Cleveland, his stops in the Midwest have been largely in friendly forums; more telling may be his success in more Republican enclaves like a Colorado or Connecticut. &quot;He was really connecting,&quot; said Sen. Tim Wirth (D., Colo.) after Mr. Dukakis drew a large crowd in suburban Denver.    With his new slogan, &quot;We're on Your Side,&quot; Mr. Dukakis simplifies not only his message but also how he treats sometimes complex issues. He offers no solution for the budget deficit, for example, but casts the problem as one where Mr. Bush and the Reagan administration have been writing &quot;hot checks&quot; that jeopardize the next generation. And he asserts that anyone &quot;on your side&quot; would cut off all U.S. aid to any government that fails to cooperate with efforts to curb narcotics, ridiculing the idea that foreign-policy considerations might also be a factor.    The pressure of the final campaign push provokes a roller coaster of emotions, and the governor's wife, Kitty, isn't given to disguising her feelings; her face betrays a fatigue and some bitterness. Introducing her husband, she refers to Republican harping on the &quot;L-word&quot; or liberal, but turns the attack back against Mr. Bush. &quot;There has been one L word my husband's opponent has used in this campaign,&quot; she says. &quot;Lies.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis is outwardly upbeat, and organizing and voting are two areas where his liberalism is attuned to his new populistic voice. &quot;This is people, folks,&quot; he tells a rally in Spokane, Wash. &quot;This is where every single one of you connect, and nobody can take it away from you.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
