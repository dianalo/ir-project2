Despite a tough operating climate the past two years, international oil giants still have enormous cash flows that could be channeled into acquisitions of other energy companies. &quot;There are going to be a lot fewer companies in the industry,&quot; predicts Bernard Picchi, a Salomon Brothers oil analyst. He isn't certain of the timing, but he says &quot;all the fundamentals are in place.&quot;    The October stock market rout knocked many oil stocks well below liquidation values. Also, it's still much cheaper to grab proven properties than search for new ones, and many companies aren't good explorers. All the majors are running out of oil. And a post-Reagan administration Justice Department may be less tolerant on any antitrust questions.    So when the next merger round starts, Mr. Picchi believes, it will be in a flurry. &quot;The major oil companies are kind of like birds on a telephone line,&quot; he says. &quot;One moves to another wire and they all want to do it.&quot;    Companies atop several analysts' hit lists include Phillips Petroleum, Unocal, Occidental Petroleum, Amerada Hess, Kerr-McGee and Murphy Oil. All trade well below estimated asset values, and have either overloaded balance sheets, poor exploration records or management that Wall Street doesn't much care for.    &quot;I'm looking for a big takeover push,&quot; says George Gaspar, an analyst at Robert W. Baird. Major companies &quot;have become inept at finding oil in the U.S.,&quot; he declares. Mr. Gaspar expects natural gas prices to rise long-term, boosting asset values of many companies and making it easier to get takeover financing. He thinks Amerada Hess, Kerr-McGee, Phillips and Maxus Energy, which have strong reserve prospects, could be acquirers if gas prices go up significantly.    Ted Eck, chief economist of Amoco, maintains that big oil companies have become more efficient the past few years, so megamergers wouldn't produce the savings they did in the past. He adds: &quot;I don't think there's any doubt there will be acquisition of reserves, but I'm not so sure they will be on a grand scale.&quot;    Drawing special attention is Texaco, because of its battle with Pennzoil. The entry of Carl Icahn into this fray just increased speculation that all or part of Texaco will be broken up.    &quot;The most concrete possibilty now is Texaco,&quot; says Kurt Wulff, an analyst who identified many big takeover targets in the last round of megamergers. A major oil company executive says his company periodically reviews all assets of its competitors, but Texaco has received special scrutiny because of its presence in bankruptcy-court proceedings.    &quot;If I were Shell Oil Co., I'd be very interested in Texaco's California oil reserves,&quot; says Tom Tracey of John S. Herold Inc., a Greenwich, Conn., oil-and-gas consulting firm. British Petroleum is another potential buyer of those assets, investment bankers say. Shell and BP both declined comment.    Also, Chevron would be interested in acquiring Texaco's half of their lucrative joint venture in Asia, Caltex, if it were for sale, Chevron chairman George Keller said recently.    Nonetheless, a Texaco deal has its doubters. &quot;I've been through taking on a company that was about to go bankrupt,&quot; says Jim Bob Moffett, chairman of Freeport-McMoRan. &quot;To try to finance something with all that hair on it isn't easy.&quot;    In late 1984, in the last spurt of megamergers, Mobil acquired Superior Oil for $5.7 billion, adding about one billion barrels of oil and gas equivalent to its reserves at less than $6 a barrel. Last quarter, oil in the ground went for an average of $4.79 a barrel, and acquisition activity is up sharply, according to investment bankers Strevig andamp; Associates in Houston. &quot;It's a ripe time,&quot; says Kerry Cummings, a Strevig vice president.    Exploration finding costs, by contrast, were $8.50 a barrel last year and an average of several dollars higher the past five years, according to an Arthur Andersen survey of 270 energy companies.    Then there's all that cash. Companies with enough cash to finance a megamerger include Chevron, Mobil, Shell Oil, BP and Exxon. (In fact, Exxon officials have acknowledged looking at all properties for sale the past few years.) The Arthur Andersen survey shows that these companies have enough proven reserves to last only about nine years at current production rates, and that the industry as a whole is replacing just 71% of what it produces.    ---           Many Oil Stocks Trade Below Net Asset Value                                                  Current                                           Net     Price/                                Stock    Asset      Asset                                Price   Value*      Value    Amerada Hess               $22 5/8    $35        65%    Amoco                       63 7/8     97        66    Ashland Oil                 54        127        43    Arco                        66 7/8    122        55    Diamond Shamrock Randamp;M         7 1/2     21        36    Kerr-McGee                  30 3/8     43        71    Maxus Energy                 7 1/8      9        79    Murphy Oil                  21 3/8     48        45    Occidental                  23 5/8     38        62    Phillips                    10 1/4     26        39    Sun Co.                     48 1/4     62        78    Unocal                      25 3/8     62        41   *Salomon Brothers estimate</TEXT></DOC>
