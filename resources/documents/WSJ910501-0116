The snow-covered military air-base outside ofMoscow was empty, and casting a last glance around I thoughtI would never see again this land of sorrow. I felt neitherjoy nor sadness as the plane took off, only exhaustion afterso many years of jails, labor camps and psychiatric wards.   One thing I knew: I had done everything possible to wakeup this vast country from its lethargy, and if I had notsucceeded it was not my fault. It was the choice of theSoviet people, a choice of a crust of bread over truth anddignity.</LP><TEXT>   Such were my thoughts again as my plane landed at Moscow'sSheremet'evo Airport this month, 14 years later. Once again,perhaps even more strangely, I did not feel either joy orsadness. My main concern was that the plane had somehowarrived one hour earlier than advertised. What should I do ifmy friends were not there to meet me? I had got my visa atthe last possible moment, and only after pressure from theBritish government.   But as I was clearing customs -- I could hear a growingroar from behind the exit doors. When the doors opened, acrowd of more than 200 rushed forward chanting: &quot;Down withthe communists]&quot; &quot;KGB -- on trial]&quot; They were waving handmadeposters, they were pushing and pressing me from all sides,and I thought for a moment that this would be the end of mylife, let alone of my visit.   Stunned, deafened, I pleaded with them to quiet down. Ittook the help of four robust bodyguards for me to work my wayout. What a stroke of luck I had come one hour early] Lookingfrom the window of my car at the shabby streets of Moscow,still bewildered by my countrymen's welcome, I keptwondering: Is this the day I lived for all of my life?   A popular joke sums up the mood in Moscow during myfive-day visit. Mr. Gorbachev is standing in front of hisportrait and asks, &quot;Are they going to remove us both verysoon?&quot;   &quot;Oh no, sir,&quot; replies the portrait. &quot;They will remove me,but they will hang you.&quot;   No Russian leader has ever been so hated as Mr. Gorbachevis. Stalin was feared and loved; Krushchev was disliked andderided as a clown; Brezhnev was despised as a dimwit. ButMr. Gorbachev is hated. People want him dead and openly sayso.   When Mr. Gorbachev began to change things in the SovietUnion, he generated immense goodwill. He was instantlycredited with a desire to introduce Western-style democracyand a market economy, although he had never promised anythingmore radical than &quot;democratization&quot; and a &quot;socialist market.&quot;As the failure of &quot;perestroika&quot; became apparent, he showedhis true face: He suspended &quot;glasnost,&quot; postponed substantialeconomic reform, ordered a crackdown on private business,robbed pensioners of their savings, and organized a massmurder in the Baltic states. At present, the streets of 84Soviet cities are being patrolled by the army -- for thepurpose, we are told, of pursuing pickpockets. And inFebruary both Kiev and Moscow witnessed the first politicaltrials of the glasnost era.   There is by now only one way to avoid civil war in theSoviet Union, and that is to dissolve the union. Just as theonly way to avert food riots and strikes followed byrepression is to introduce a market economy far moreradically than it was done in Poland. Neither can be done aslong as Mr. Gorbachev and his elite remain in power. Theyhave no solutions, only tactical moves aimed at slowing downthe dissolution of the state. Martial law would onlyaggravate the crisis, adding mutiny in the army to thediscontent in the country.   Ironically, the more power Mr. Gorbachev acquires legally,the less power he has in reality. If this process continues,he will end up having absolute power over nothing. Hisdecrees are ignored, his orders disobeyed, his closestassociates are looking for more reliable jobs. He is becomingas irrelevant as a foreman at the Tower of Babel, whoseworkers quarrel in different languages as the tower crumbles.   For instance, Mr. Gorbachev has ordered a crackdown onprivate business activity, but business is thriving in asemi-legal form. I talked to a number of business figures,and discovered that for them Mr. Gorbachev's &quot;crackdown&quot; isnothing but a nuisance. It simply discourages them frommaking any long-term investments, robs the government of aconsiderable revenue in unpayed taxes and makes the economycompletely unmanageable.   Similarly, censorship has supposedly been re-introduced atthe Central Television and Radio, and some popular programs,such as &quot;Vzglyad&quot; (&quot;Outlook&quot;) have been taken off the air.Yet the first to meet me at the airport were the crew from&quot;Vzglyad.&quot; Despite the government, they continue to maketheir program, syndicating it through local stations in everycorner of the country. Moscow is about the only place whereyou cannot see it. Likewise, although the Russian Republic'stelevision station is not supposed to begin broadcastinguntil May 12, its shows are being broadcast in time purchasedfrom local stations. One should probably even thank Mr.Gorbachev for suspending glasnost -- he has at last pushedjournalists to develop a real free press.   The same could be said about many other aspects of life.Genuine democratic institutions are developing in response toMr. Gorbachev's attempt at suppressing them. An independentlabor movement is being forged out of the current strikes inthe coal mines. I am convinced that the strikes will spreadfurther: The people quite rightly perceive them to be theonly non-violent way of removing the remnants of thecommunist power structure.   Unfortunately, the formal democratic movement has beenless successful. Most of its leaders emerged in the wave ofelections in 1989-90, when anybody seemed better than theparty bosses. By and large, they are politicallyinexperienced and appear to be considerably less radical thanthe &quot;masses&quot; they are supposed to lead.   The democrats' main mistake is that they take tooseriously their parliamentary activity. Most of their time isspent fruitlessly debating issues over which they have nocontrol. I attended the opening session of the Supreme Sovietof the Russian Federation on April 18. At least an hour wastaken up debating which microphones should be used by whichgroup of deputies. At the end they voted on the question inthe most democratic manner. Meanwhile, the country was goingto pieces and a general strike was looming on the horizon.   Seeing all this, I used the opportunity to climb to therostrum during a break and make a speech. No one objected.What, I asked them, would they do if tomorrow someoneswitches off their microphones?   The parliamentary democrats are more afraid of the peoplethan of the communist rulers. At the time of my stay inMoscow, two subjects were intensely discussed: whether tosupport the miners' strike and whether to enter into&quot;roundtable talks&quot; with Mr. Gorbachev. While even thecommunists understood that they should jump on the bandwagonand try to &quot;lead&quot; the strike, the democrats were reluctant tocommit themselves to anything more definite than &quot;moralsupport&quot; or financial assistance.   The democrats' position on talks with Mr. Gorbachev waseven more foolish. At least in Poland, the democrats hadbehind them all the might of Solidarity, and the table was,indeed, round. In the Soviet Union, with no structure behindthe democrats and a threat of martial law hanging over them,the table will be of any other shape but round. Thedemocrats' interest in talks reflects something more thanpolitical naivety and inexperience: It indicates how scaredthey are of the growing revolutionary sentiments of theirpeople, and how easily they might betray those people.   Boris Yeltsin, too, seems to be still undecided whether itshould be in coalition with, or in opposition to Mr.Gorbachev. No one could explain to me the reason for suchindecision. Perhaps he listens too much to the critics whoaccuse him of being unwilling to compromise for the sake ofthe country. Or, maybe, he really believes that the countrycan be saved only in alliance with Mr. Gorbachev. But,whatever the answer, he is making a grave mistake. The choiceis between the people and the party, and there is nocompromise between the two. Mr. Gorbachev's unpopularity isso great that anyone supporting him is in danger,particularly Mr. Yeltsin whose power is based completely on apopular perception of him as the mortal enemy of Mr.Gorbachev.   Mr. Yeltsin's mistakes are plentiful. For one, he is notsufficiently power-hungry to be a successful politician.Practically all Russia's industry and mineral resources arein the hands of the Soviet Union, as is the money supply, thearmy, the KGB and the police force.   Mr. Yeltsin's sporadic, ill-prepared visits abroad havebrought him more harm than good. He must bring together ateam capable of developing and maintaining foreign relations,foreign trade, cultural relations and so on if we are ever tosee a democratic Russsia.   But, having said that, I still support him. I might likeor dislike him personally, I might agree or disagree with himin politics, but I support him as the first democraticallyelected leader of Russia. And when I hear snobbish &quot;experts&quot;in the West describing him as &quot;unreliable&quot; or &quot;unbalanced,&quot; Ifeel insulted. For those who believe in democracy are obligedto respect the will of the millions who elected him. Andthose who insult him, insult the nation to which I belong.   The Russian nation has survived. Its recovery is not goingto be easy, and it may take longer than one generation. Butit has survived. I saw people who will not surrender, whowill not return to slavery even if the entire world supportstheir enemy. Somehow I felt I did contribute to this miracle,if only slightly. And when journalists asked me at theairport, &quot;Will you come again?&quot; I answered firmly, &quot;You bet.&quot;   ---   Mr. Bukovsky, a veteran of the Soviet dissident movementof the 1960s, was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1976.
