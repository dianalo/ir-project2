Training courses focus on areas such as environmentaland pollution control, analytical chemistry, purity control of nuclearmaterials, dosimetry, isotope hydrology, nuclear electronics and instrumentation,and computer programming and maintenance. PCI also organizes group trainingfor selected fellowships for periods up to 6 months; and in-service trainingfor periods ranging from 2 months to 1 year. The programmes for in-servicetraining are divided into four areas: chemistry, nuclear instrumentation,dosimetry, and isotope hydrology. An advanced training course in isotopeanalytical techniques is planned for 1990 and will be addressed to thestaff of environmental isotope laboratories in developing countries.</TEXT></DOC>
