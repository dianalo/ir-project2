He is not addressing theissues.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  POPE'S CRITICISM DISAPPOINTS POLES WHO HOPEDFOR PRAISE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The pope who visited Poland was far different from the one most Polesexpected. Instead of congratulating them on overthrowing communism andconsoling them on growing economic hardships, John Paul II scolded them andoccasionally thundered at them in fury. He lectured farmers in rural Poland onthe evils of lust; he warned workers facing unemployment of the evils ofabortion.;    By the time he left Sunday, many Poles were fed up.;    &quot;Whydoes he keep yelling at us?&quot; asked Anna Jancewicz, a business consultant inWarsaw.;    &quot;Before, he was telling off the authorities,&quot; said Ernest Skalski,deputy editor-in-chief of Gazeta Wyborca, Poland's most popular newspaper.&quot;Now he is telling off the people. But people do not change their ideas, theirbehavior when they are being argued with. They listen to politicians orprophets when they hear what they want to hear. People expect compassion andunderstanding rather than condemnation.&quot;;    Aside from his repeatedcondemnations of abortion and his controversial comparison of abortion to theHolocaust, the pope's trip to Poland gave the clearest picture yet of his viewof Eastern Europe after communism -- a future he helped create with his threetrips to communist Poland and constant nurturing of the anti-communist cause.It is a vision sharply at odds with the triumphant mood in the United States,and both Western and Eastern Europe.;    For most Americans, the new Poland,with its plethora of shops and goods, its surging entrepreneurial class, evenits vices, such as pornography, is a reassuring affirmation of Western valuesand democracy.;    Even the trappings of the pope's trip reflected Poland'snew embrace of Western capitalism and reverence. There were pope balloons,pope T-shirts, even pope rugs.;    THE POPE saw all this differently. For him,Europe and America stand for much he admires: freedom, tolerance, democracy.But the West also stands for much he deplores: adultery, materialism,abortion.;    In his final homily Sunday, speaking off the cuff and withemotion, John Paul II described his disappointment with the recent course ofWestern history:;    &quot;We must take into account that, as time has passed,especially in the so-called modern age, Christ -- as the creator of the soulof Europe, the creator of this freedom that has its roots in him -- has beenplaced in parentheses, and a new mentality has begun to form, a mentalitywhich could be expressed by the following phrase: Let us think, let us act asif God did not exist.&quot;;    In the past, the pope warned, Poles squanderedtheir freedom by &quot;arrogant self-confidence, lack of thought, consumerism.&quot;Such dangers, he said over and over, were just as real these days. They are asreal, he suggested, as the goods now available in stores and the freedom tovote and speak freely.;    What gave his message its bite this time was thepersonal tone he took with Poles, scolding them and sometimes thundering atthem like a father berating errant children.;    &quot;This land is my mother,&quot; thepope said in one emotion-charged speech, tossing away his prepared text. &quot;Youare my brothers and sisters. You must understand -- all you who thoughtlesslyconsider these matters -- these things cannot fail to concern me, cannot failto hurt me. They should hurt you, too.&quot;;    Some think the pope's message fellon deaf ears.;    &quot;The position of the church will go on weakening,&quot; Skalskisaid. &quot;Poland is entering very fast the process of secularization. . . .Catholics do not cease being Catholics, but they become secular in theirbehavior.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JONATHAN KAUFMAN, Boston Globe  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Warsaw, Poland  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910611  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  699  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 11, 199100163213,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
