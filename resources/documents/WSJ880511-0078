Zimmer, a Pompano, Fla., maker of luxury cars, manufactured housing and van conversions, said its main operating subsidiaries, Zimmer Motor Cars Corp., Zimmer Motor Coach Corp. and Zimmer Recreational Products Corp. also filed Chapter 11 petitions.    Separately, Zimmer reported it had a loss of $10.6 million, on sales of $12.8 million, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 26, 1987. That compared with a year-earlier loss of $7 million on sales of $27.2 million.    For the latest fiscal year, Zimmer posted a loss of $9.9 million on sales of $98.9 million. In fiscal 1986, the company had losses of $7.9 million on sales of $134.6 million.    Zimmer said it plans to continue to operate at least two manufactured housing divisions and its van conversion subsidiary, representing a &quot;substantial part&quot; of its overall operations, while it formulates a plan of reorganization.    Under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts. </TEXT></DOC>
