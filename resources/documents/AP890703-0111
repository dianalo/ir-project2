Though the governing party said its candidate won the BajaCalifornia governor's race, the challenger said partial returnsindicated he was leading.   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, claimedvictory in 10 of 18 legislative districts in Michoacan state, whereit was gauging its strength after losing to the left in generalelections last July.   The centrist PRI said it swept voting in Chihuahua and Zacatecasstates and held strong leads in the Chihuahua mayoral races inCiudad Juarez and the city of Chihuahua itself.   Returns were not yet available in Campeche state.   The elections tested the pledge of President Carlos Salinas deGortari to end fraudulent elections and respect opposition victories.   However, opposition parties charged that the PRI inflated voterregistration lists, sent groups of voters to cast ballots in severalpolling places, and cheated in other ways.   Congressman Norberto Corrella of the conservative National ActionParty, or PAN, told reporters today he spent all night recoveringstolen ballot boxes and filing complaints with the districtattorney's office in Mexicali, the capital of Baja California.   ``We recovered 17 ballot boxes that were taken away,'' he said,alleging that deputies appointed by local election boards stole theboxes from precincts where their party was losing. These deputiesappeared hours later at the electoral commission with a ballot boxcontaining altered ballots, and ``All of a sudden ... they arewinning 10-to-1,'' he said.   Promises by Salinas and Chihuahua Gov. Fernando Baeza of cleanelections ``were just words,'' said Jesus Hernandez, a PAN spokesmanin Ciudad Juarez. ``These elections were dirty.''   However, opposition party officials contacted in several statesindicated that overall, the irregularities were less widespread andserious than in the past.   ``Incidents of direct violence were fewer, but the institutionalviolence that is hidden by false documents is intact,'' said PedroCesar Acosta, a PAN spokesman in Chihuahua state.   The PRI had some of its own charges. In Michoacan, JoseGuadarrama, a member of the PRI national committee, accusedopposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of campaigning at pollingplaces in the state.   With 10 percent of the vote counted in the Baja Californiagovernor's race, ``the victory of Margarita Ortega is clean andunchallengeable,'' said Eduardo Manuel Martinez Palomera, a PRIdistrict committee president.   But Ernesto Ruffo, the PAN challenger, said a count of 25 percentof the vote by his party showed him winning.   A Ruffo victory would hand the PRI the first loss in a governor'selection in its 60-year history.   The PRI also said complete but unofficial results showed it hadwon or was leading in 10 other Chihuahua mayoral races.   PAN in Baja California said its unofficial results indicated itwas leading in Ensenada, where Ruffo had been mayor, and in Tijuana.The PRI said it had no early returns for the cities.   Official results were not expected for a week.   The liberal Democratic Revolutionary Party in Michoacan and thePAN in Chihuahua and Baja California complained of irregularities invoter registration lists.   PAN said the lists were padded by hundreds of thousands of names,while names of opposition supporters vanished.   Some people in Michoacan showed reporters voter registrationcards but said they had been told they were not on the lists andwere not permitted to vote.   Other critics said the indelible ink used to mark voter's fingersto prevent them from voting more than once had been removed in somecases.   Attempts to steal ballot boxes were reported in Ciudad Juarez andin Baja California, but both failed.   About half the eligible voters cast ballots in Baja California,the PRI said. While no figures were available, opposition leaders inthe other states said turnout was far lower.</TEXT></DOC>
