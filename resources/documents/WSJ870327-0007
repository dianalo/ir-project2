GrisdelaStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FINANCIAL, INSURANCE, MUTUAL FUNDS, ACCOUNTING, LEASING (FIN)SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted to seek public comment on a proposal to require a mandatory peer review every three years for accounting firms that audit publicly traded companies.    Currently, many accounting firms undergo voluntary peer reviews through membership in the SEC Practice Section of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. These accountants audit about 84% of all publicly held companies registered with the SEC, the agency said. Other accounting firms are peer-reviewed by associations of firms.    Under the proposed rule changes, accounting firms would have the option of having the peer review conducted through an existing peer review organization, such as the institute's program, or having the review supervised by the SEC. In a peer review, one auditing firm or a team of accountants examines another auditing firm's quality-control system and its accounting and auditing practice.    Having the option of a review supervised by the SEC addresses complaints by some in the accounting profession that mandatory peer review would require them to join the institute, raising antitrust concerns. All reviews would have to be conducted in accordance with standards established by the commission.    Under the proposal, accounting firms that don't submit to peer review would be barred from auditing publicly traded companies. And if an accounting firm failed to correct weaknesses in procedures after a peer review, the proposed rule changes would allow the SEC, after an administrative hearing, to disqualify the firm from certifying financial statements for companies registered with the SEC.    A. Clarence Sampson, the SEC's chief accountant, said peer review won't stop all audit failures, but it will &quot;deal very well&quot; with accounting firms whose procedures aren't adequate enough to do a good audit.    Although the vote to seek comment on this issue for 90 days was unanimous, Commissioner Joseph Grundfest compared mandatory peer review to &quot;taking a cannon to a fly.&quot; At his suggestion, the commission agreed to seek comment on whether simply disclosing in the financial statements if the auditing firm had been reviewed would provide adequate investor protection.    Under the proposals, an accounting firm that became subject to the rule because it obtains a new public client or an existing client goes public would be allowed 18 months to obtain its initial peer review. During the grace period, however, all of the firm's audits of public companies would have to be reviewed by an accounting firm that had a peer review within the last three years.    The SEC estimates the cost of complying with the rule change would total about $2,250,000 over three years for the 500 firms that currently don't undergo voluntary reviews. </TEXT></DOC>
