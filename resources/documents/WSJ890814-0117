Here on a scrubby, high-desert mesa an hour's drive north of Phoenix, architect Paolo Soleri set out 19 years ago to build an experimental city of the future -- the truly far-out future, not your wimpy life-in-the-year-2000 future. He planned an &quot;organic&quot; city, self-contained and self-sufficient on 14 acres of concrete structures in cellular modules for living, food-growing, industrial work, culture and entertainment.    Mr. Soleri's architectural dreams, packed in dense prose and published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, had a powerful appeal a generation ago. The Whitney Museum in New York had a Soleri exhibit. In his sketches of desert and other beehive cities such as &quot;Novanoah,&quot; which would float on the sea, and &quot;Arcodiga,&quot; which would honeycomb the inert mass of a huge dam, idealists and futurists saw the harnessing of advanced technology to the cause of cosmic consciousness.    Arcosanti, a loose translation of the Italian term for &quot;anti-materialism,&quot; was the first of the cities to get off the drawing board. But the way things are going it probably will be the last. &quot;We sit here and stagnate and wonder whether we're an arcology or not,&quot; says 20-year-old Micol Seigel, a senior at Yale who is working here this summer. At Arcosanti's peak, more than 200 people lived in this first of Mr. Soleri's arcologies -- a word he coined to express the harmonious blending of architecture and ecology. Most left, disillusioned with the slow progress of city-building. Today there are just 60 residents.    &quot;If we were building, there would be more people,&quot; Ms. Seigel says. But construction work, only 3% completed, stopped last May. Over the years, $12 million was spent to produce a collection of concrete-and-steel cubes, domes, arches and bandshell-like apses. The major economic activities now are architectural workshops that people pay to attend, the manufacture of bronze windbells designed by Mr. Soleri, and tourism.    All this brings in only $500,000 or so a year in revenues. Officials of Mr. Soleri's Cosanti, a not-for-profit organization that sponsors the project, estimate that as originally envisioned it would cost $500 million to complete. Mr. Soleri, who no longer talks about when it might be completed, has resigned himself to a scaled-down version that would cost about $26 million. No investor or philanthropist has yet volunteered a large sum for the project.    Tourists, 50,000 a year, pay $4 each to visit the place. They see an urban landscape that looks like a disjointed assortment of concrete-and-steel curves and cubes. The background noise is the clanging of ubiquitous windbells and the buzz of the machinery that makes them. The residents are a mix of youngsters and old-timers who remain more or less faithful to Mr. Soleri's vision. &quot;Coming from New York City, this is sort of an alien environment,&quot; says a wide-eyed Bob Ruggiero, making a stop on his way to the Grand Canyon.    Some visitors leave disappointed. The Japanese, for example, become aware that they have already seen the future -- in Tokyo. Arcosanti attracts many Japanese tourists, who are unhappy when they learn that the city was designed to house 5,000 people, more than 300 an acre. &quot;It reminds them too much of home,&quot; says William Otwell, an architect in nearby Prescott.    &quot;People come off the interstate expecting to find utopia, and it's not here,&quot; says Kristy Snyder, a 21-year-old Arcosanti office worker. She and others still hope that Mr. Soleri's ideas will help change the face of the world's cities. &quot;With this project, it doesn't matter how long it takes,&quot; she says. &quot;It's the concept that's important.&quot;    Mr. Soleri has hardly quit dreaming since he came to Arizona in the late 1940s to serve a fellowship under the late Frank Lloyd Wright. He has become the most radical of Mr. Wright's disciples. A hale 70-year-old, he pads around in shorts and sandals, preaching his gospel: that the American Dream of single-family homes and automobiles in every garage promises environmental disaster. It distresses him that American-style consumerism has engaged the rest of the world.    Some of Arcosanti's youthful detractors say a lack of strong leadership and direction has slowed Arcosanti as much as a lack of money. They say Mr. Soleri has increasingly distanced himself from it since the death of his wife in 1983. He now spends most of his time working alone at his home in Scottsdale.    &quot;It's so annoying,&quot; Mr. Soleri says of the criticism, dismissing it as part of &quot;the arrogance of ignorance. There is this sudden explosion of the wisdom of the babies. They try to spew out sentences before they know anything, instead of being humble. If you are 'wise' at 19 or 20, you will never really be wise.&quot;    Mr. Soleri calls Arcosanti an urban laboratory. Such &quot;arcologies,&quot; he says, will conserve space, time and energy while preserving the wilderness that conventional cities gobble up. People will live, work and play in megastructures built to ward off heat in summer and preserve it in winter. Cars won't be necessary. Massive greenhouses will provide food and even heat.    If Arcosanti is such a lab, it is the no-frills kind. Besides the windbell foundry and some craft shops, there are living quarters, a music center, amphitheater, library, swimming pool and a boxy four-story visitors center. There's also a pair of huge arched vaults, designed to serve as a concrete gateway to the city, which overlooks a scenic ravine.    Mr. Soleri and his Cosanti associates hope to raise enough money to build living quarters for 500 people. Then Arcosanti would be &quot;self-supporting enough to demonstrate the validity of our concept,&quot; says Mel Roman, chairman of Cosanti.    Many of Arcosanti's workshoppers and employees now live in &quot;Cubetown,&quot; an area of 20 stark, crudely furnished eight-foot-square concrete dwellings with circular windows, a Soleri signature. Workers raise peaches, tomatoes, corn and other edibles in the surrounding fields. Guinea fowl guard against grasshoppers, and &quot;weeder geese&quot; trim the lawns. Skunks roam freely.    &quot;When I first came here, I definitely thought I would be pouring concrete,&quot; says Roy Mars, a 26-year-old native of West Germany. Instead, he tends the watermelon patch. Ms. Seigel, the Yale student, toils in the foundry. Like most others, she first came here as a workshop participant, paying $400 for the privilege of taking part and doing odd jobs. Now she and other employees earn the minimum wage, paying back 15% as rent.    Others man the visitors center and bake cinnamon pumpkin bread in the bakery. When the day's work is done, residents swim, or play Frisbee, or watch the sunset.    Arcosanti's neighbors in Cordes Junction, about two miles down a dirt road from here, never have fully grasped that something of transcendental significance was taking place here. They see Arcosanti as a vestigial commune of the 1960s, or maybe a colony of nudists. &quot;I have no use for them at all,&quot; says a bearded local man who won't give his name. &quot;That's Hippieville.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
