North's lawyers immediately moved to dismiss the indictmentagainst North, saying it was impossible for the former White Houseaide to get a fair trial under federal secrecy procedures.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell sent the jurors home,saying there were ``unresolved'' problems concerning the classifiedmaterial. He scheduled an afternoon hearing on the matter.   ``We are dealing with problems inherent in the nature in thistrial: what is classified and what isn't classified,'' said Northlawyer Brendan Sullivan. He said the matter was ``so extraordinaryand so important it affects the ongoing nature of the trial.''   The dispute was triggered by a memo by Owen, which stated thename of a high Costa Rican official, former security ministerBenjamin Piza. Owen's memo containing Piza's name had already beenturned over in a lawsuit to the Christic Institute, an activistgroup, that has been critical of U.S. policy in Central America.   However, when the same document was introduced at North's trial,Piza's name had been excised by U.S. intelligence officials onnational security grounds.   The disclosure that the name had been turned over to theinstitute last summer caused Gesell to call for the hearing.   ``We have reached a point where I have to take some testimonyrelating to legal matters,'' he told the jury. ``I did not realizethis situation confronted me until I arrived at 7 o'clock thismorning.''   Owen was North's courier to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua andwas being cross-examined by Sullivan. Owen was to appear at thisafternoon's hearing.   North's lawyers filed a motion asking that the indictment againstNorth be dismissed on the ground of ``misconduct'' by theprosecution.   They alleged in the motion that the office of independent counselLawrence Walsh had known for at least 10 days that all but one of 19memos by Owen to North introduced in the case had previously beenturned over to the Christic Institute.   ``Instead of disclosing this critical fact, the IC (independentcounsel) hid it, and incredibly, insisted that the court and thedefense treat these already-public documents as classified,'' themotion said.   Sullivan complained that the defense ``has spent days trying todevise means of tiptoeing around information, ... that the IC knewall along had already been released to the public.''   ``This misconduct mandates dismissal of the indictment,'' hismotion said.   Ten of the Owen memos were censored ``because of perceived dangerto national security.''   Sullivan's motion outlined the circumstances under which thedefense learned after 10 p.m. Tuesday from Owen's lawyer that theuncensored versions of the Owen memos had been given to the ChristicInstitute in the suit.   Sullivan asked for the hearing to find out exactly whenprosecutors knew about this, what efforts they made to prevent theinstitute from disclosing them and ``why the fact of publicdisclosure was withheld from the defense and the court while thesematters were being hotly litigated.''   The defense lawyer said the dispute demonstrates why the lawdealing with national secrets ``is unworkable and unconstitutional''in the North case.   ``The government is simply unable to manage the classifiedinformation at issue here in a manner that permits a fair trial,''said the defense motion. It asked that Gesell consider an earlierrequest by the defense that the Classified Information ProceduresAct be declared unconstitutional.   In court, the head of the prosecution team, John Keker, said``there was knowledge'' within the independent counsel's officeabout the Christic Institute and the Owen memos. But Keker deniedtrying to mislead the court, saying ``we certainly didn't make arepresentation yesterday that we knew weren't correct.''   Sullivan said it is ``appalling to me what is happening ... Ibelieve there is a fraud on the defense.''   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and a former NationalSecurity Council aide, faces 12 felony charges, includingallegations he lied to lawmakers to cover up his secret efforts tohelp the Contras when such assistance was banned by Congress.   Gesell is assigning code names to mask the identities of foreignofficials and intelligence operatives the government wants keptsecret.   A CIA headquarters official with whom Owen met in Costa Rica wasassigned the code-name ``CIA One'' during Monday's proceedings.</TEXT></DOC>
