The Illinois Democrat's proposal doesn't contain any new taxes, but rather is composed of extensions, speed-ups and modifications of current taxes. It would raise $8 billion in the fiscal year that began today and $27.4 billion over three fiscal years. It would still be $4 billion short of the goal set by Democratic leaders for fiscal 1988.    The package includes about $3 billion of revenue-raising provisions from President Reagan's budget, an idea that's likely to be controversial among Democrats. It also contains an extension of three expiring tax provisions, closure of an estate-tax loophole created by last year's tax law, and a revision of corporate estimated tax.    Rep. Rostenkowski is looking for Republican support to help pass the tax bill, not only in committee but also on the House floor. Republican members say they aren't yet disposed to vote for any tax increase, however.    The Ways and Means chairman acknowledged in an interview that he expects to meet resistance on some of the package from both Democrats and Republicans. &quot;I can imagine that there are some things that some members will not want considered,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said. One likely controversy, he noted, would be on the president's proposal to extend the Medicare payroll tax to all state and local government employees.    The Ways and Means chairman said he wants the panel to vote on the $8 billion package at today's meeting, which is expected to be private.    &quot;At the present time, the Republicans aren't ready to vote for anything,&quot; Rep. John Duncan of Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican, said last night. He said the GOP members wanted to see the whole $12 billion package of tax increases, rather than committing to only a part of the measure. Don Chapoton, acting assistant Treasury Secretary, met with Republicans yesterday and they agreed they didn't want to endorse any tax increase yet, lawmakers said.    Rep. Rostenkowski indicated that he wanted to take votes on his $8 billion proposal today, and would look to other lawmakers next week to suggest tax increases to meet the $12 billion goal.    According to a memorandum Rep. Rostenkowski distributed to committee members last night, one provision he will propose today would make corporations' estimated tax payments more current than they are now, bringing their schedules more closely in line with those used by individuals. This provision would raise $1.8 billion in the first year, and &quot;has a good chance&quot; of being approved, according to Rep. Duncan. The provision isn't all bad for corporations, however, because it would also relax penalties for estimates that prove to be too low.    Rep. Rostenkowski will also ask the panel to increase estate taxes by narrowing a loophole created in last year's tax-overhaul legislation. Last year's provision allows an estate to escape taxation by selling stock to an employee stock-ownership plan, or ESOP, and then deducting half the proceeds from the taxable value of the estate. The change, which is likely to be accepted by the committee, would raise $1.3 billion in the first year.    Rep. Rostenkowski's list also includes $2.9 billion of proposals from President Reagan's 1988 budget, although the chairman hasn't committed himself to them specifically. In addition to the proposed extension of the Medicare payroll tax to all state and local employees, lawmakers will vote on expanding the Social Security payroll tax to earnings of students employed by their schools and also to all cash tips, which are currently exempt from the employer share of the tax. </TEXT></DOC>
