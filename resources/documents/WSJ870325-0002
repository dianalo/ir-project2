Macklin, who helped lead the over-the-counter sector to become the nation's second-largest securities market, resigned as president of the National Association of Securities Dealers.    Mr. Macklin resigned to become chairman and co-chief executive officer of the San Francisco-based Hambrecht andamp; Quist Group securities firm. He will stay on at the NASD until a new president is named.    The resignation comes at a pivotal time for the OTC market, which the NASD regulates. As never before, the market is locked in intense competition with other stock markets for business both in the U.S. and abroad. Mr. Macklin said that when he informed senior NASD staff members that he was resigning after 17 years as president, they were astonished.    In fact, the 58-year-old Mr. Macklin only recently had been talked out of leaving next year. &quot;We were looking forward to another five or six years of his leadership,&quot; says Joseph R. Hardiman, chief operating officer of Baltimore-based Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc. and NASD chairman.    Under Mr. Macklin's leadership, the Washington-based NASD has closed the gap between it and the New York Stock Exchange in terms of shares traded, climbing far beyond the American Stock Exchange. The OTC market's engine of growth has been its Nasdaq automated securities quotation system, which allows far-flung dealers to quickly exchange quotes and make trades.    Mr. Macklin, a tireless promoter who often disarmed critics and rivals with his self-deprecating manner, says he won't be missed. But he leaves an organization infinitely stronger than when he took over.    The latest challenges to the NASD include a race with the Big Board and Amex to establish links with foreign exchanges. Both exchanges have heated up marketing efforts to list newly public companies that traditionally have been the backbone of the OTC market.    The NASD and the exchanges have been debating a set of uniform guidelines on shareholder voting rights. And the NASD is negotiating with several states' regulators to win the same type of simplified approval for OTC securities that states currently accorded to stocks listed on the Big Board and the Amex.    Mr. Hardiman said the NASD is putting together a committee of about 10 people to choose Mr. Macklin's successor. He said the NASD is looking for either a securities-industry executive or regulator, and that the organization hopes to choose a successor by July.    Perhaps Mr. Macklin's biggest contribution to the growth of the OTC market has been his lobbying and public relations skills. The Nasdaq system lifted the market from the confusion and uncertainty of the &quot;pink sheets,&quot; where offers to buy and sell stocks were recorded overnight and distributed to subscribers on pink pieces of paper each morning. Nasdaq was under development when Mr. Macklin became president in 1970.    What Mr. Macklin did was court the press, smooth over warring factions among his membership, and make a forceful case for his organization before Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The NASD's Washington base gave Mr. Macklin an advantage over rival markets. &quot;Macklin can spend all his time glad-handing congressmen; we can only do it when we go down there once in a while,&quot; a Big Board executive once lamented.    &quot;Gordon was a very strong lobbyist; he had very good friends on Capitol Hill and at the SEC,&quot; says Peter DaPuzzo, senior executive vice president and head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Mr. Macklin often rankled his exchange comptitors, who charge that he and the NASD have more style than substance. The Big Board's chairman, John J. Phelan Jr., once described Mr. Macklin in a speech as &quot;the greatest master of perception since the Japanese warrior Yamatsu, who invented the smoke screen.&quot;    One of Mr. Macklin's biggest marketing coups was getting the SEC to approve in 1982 the term &quot;national market&quot; to describe a set of the largest OTC stocks, which trade based on the last sale price, the way exchange-listed stocks do.    The exchanges have long argued that their stocks really represent the &quot;national market&quot; as mandated by Congress in the mid-1970s. The NASD national market &quot;is a complete misnomer,&quot; charges Robert J. Birnbaum, president of the Big Board. &quot;Only people that don't have great depth of understanding think that Nasdaq is the national market system.&quot;    Nasdaq operates with market makers who compete to offer customers the best prices for purchases and sales. Stock exchanges have a single market maker, known as a specialist, assigned to each stock.    Another Macklin marketing coup, say some industry observers, is the establishment of Nasdaq in the minds of many investors as the most technologically sophisticated market. It is another point competitors bristle at. &quot;The New York Stock Exchange has spent more than anybody in bringing the use of computers and automation to the exchange floor,&quot; Mr. Birnbaum says.    Though stepping down from the NASD, Mr. Macklin isn't finished needling competitors. Of the Big Board, Mr. Macklin said in an interview yesterday, &quot;How long do you think people are going to stand in a marble hall and trade?&quot; He insists that the Big Board and the Amex will eventually have to move toward a system closer to the NASD's, as London's Stock Exchange recently said it will do.    Responds Mr. Birnbaum, &quot;It sounds like he's still doing a PR commercial.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
