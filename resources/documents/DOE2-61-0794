However, recently the developmentsin land use for agriculture within the European Community are puttingforward the question to what extent and at what time forest policy hasto start dealing with those matters outside the regular forests. Theforthcoming set-aside regulations from EC headquarters can be seen asa challenge, especially for the scientific field of forest policy. Indue time, not only the technical options should be developed but alsoand above all the questions arising from the socio-economic point ofview. This article deals with matters like the following. Under whatconditions will a farmer be prepared to change land use into forestrye.g. wood raw material production in short rotations? What about futurewood market including price developments? How to deal with farmer's attitudesconfined to annual and not to perennial crops; his interests being moreoriented on yearly income than on long term benefits? What about theway of diffusion of up-to-date information? To mention some points ofpolicy concern. Forest policy should deliberate the several options -maybe in a holistic way - in order to provide the information neededby decision-makers, including the farmers concerned.</TEXT></DOC>
