(FDC)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. proposeda rule designed to prevent troubled banks from payinggenerous termination payments -- known as golden parachutes-- to resigning executives.   &quot;I got tired of seeing guys run banks into the ground andthen leave with a fortune greater than they would have madeif they'd stayed in the banking business,&quot; said FDIC ChairmanWilliam Seidman, who has pushed for the change.</LP><TEXT>   Banking lawyers said the rule, if adopted, could have abig impact on compensation agreements with top executives.Although it would limit payments only for executives leavingbanks that are insolvent or on the brink of insolvency, theprovision could affect the way contracts are written at allbanks, because a bank that is healthy today could fall onhard times in the future.   Even the FDIC raised the fear that the limitation couldmake it more difficult for troubled institutions to attractskilled executives to lead them back to health. In suchsituations, golden parachutes are permissible if the FDICapproves them.   In putting the proposal out for a 60-day public commentperiod, the FDIC specifically asked guidance on whether theregulation &quot;appropriately balances the protection of theinsurance funds with the needs of insured depositoryinstitutions . . . to attract and retain qualified directorsand management.&quot;   The proposal also would set guidelines that banks mustmeet before they could pay legal fees incurred inadministrative or civil proceedings initiated by the FDIC orother federal regulators. The proposal would bar thereimbursement or payment of fines, penalties, judgments orsettlements obtained against an officer or director.   This part of the proposal is designed to prevent failinginstitutions from prepaying legal fees or taking other actionto indemnify officers and directors against future costs atthe expense of the bank deposit insurance fund.   After the FDIC board voted unanimously to issue theproposal, Mr. Seidman said he has been campaigning for such arule for years. But he quipped, &quot;Now that I'm going out intothe private sector, I'll probably find them terriblyonerous.&quot; His term expires in three weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
