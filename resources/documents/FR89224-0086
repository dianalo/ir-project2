The Mexican Ministry of Health has requested CDC to collaboratein conducting this study to obtain information concerning its potentialuse to eliminate measles in Mexico and other developing countries. Adequatenumbers of infants who received these vaccines can be located in orderto evaluate antibody persistence. Assistance will be provided only to theMexican Ministry of Health which as a result of the current study has accessto a cohort of children who received the EZ and Schwarz measles vaccineat 6 months of age and for whom serial serum specimens are available. Boththe field workers and epidemiologists in Mexico have demonstrated the abilityto execute these studies. No other applications are solicited or will beaccepted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Funds</ITAG>Approximately $10,000 is available in Fiscal Year 1989 to fund this award.The award is expected to begin on or about April 1, 1989, for a 12 monthbudget period in a 1-2 year project period. Funding estimates may varyand are subject to change. A continuation award within the project periodwill be made on the basis of satisfactory performance and the availabilityof funds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose</ITAG>The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to:1. Evaluate the antibody status between 12-18 months after vaccinationof infants who were vaccinated with EZ and Schwarz measles vaccine administeredby subcutaneous injection at 6 months of age.2. Evaluate antibody titers in mothers of infants who had been vaccinatedin the study.<ITAG tagnum="84">Program Requirements</ITAG>1. Recipient ActivitiesA. Develop a protocol to assess the antibody status of recipients of EZand Schwarz high and medium doses of vaccine more than 1 year after vaccination.The protocol should assess both infants immunized and their mothers andshould include a sufficient sample size to meet the tests for statisticalvalidity.B. Implement the protocol.C. Analyze the data and publish the results.2. CDC ActivitiesA. Collaborate in study design and protocol development.B. Assist in monitoring the collection of data.C. Test or arrange for testing of sera for measles antibody by plaque-neutralization,and enzyme immunoassay.D. Assist with data entry and data analysis, and collaborate in publishingthe results.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evaluation Criteria</ITAG>The application will be reviewed and evaluated by a CDC convened ad hoccommittee based on the following criteria:1. The extent to which the proposed objectives are measurable, specific,time-phased, and related to required recipient activities and program purpose.2. The quality of the applicant's plan for conducting program activitiesand the potential effectiveness of the proposed methods in meeting itsobjectives.3. The qualifications of the project personnel and evidence of their experiencein related activities.In addition, consideration will also be given to the extent that the budgetrequest and proposed use of project funds are appropriate and reasonable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number</ITAG>The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number is 13.283.<ITAG tagnum="84">Application Submission and Deadline</ITAG>The original and two copies of the application (PHS 5161-1) must be submittedto Nancy C.
