Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at1.6690 marks, off from 1.6775 marks late Wednesday in NewYork. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 136.04yen, down from 137.45 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.7845,up from $1.7710.</LP><TEXT>   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 136.06yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 137.45 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6715 marks,down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.6843 marks.   After yesterday's news that as of March 16 the percentageof eligible workers receiving unemployment had reached itshighest level since October 1983, several economists warnedthat the decline in March non-farm payrolls could exceedinitial estimates. Those warnings erased any lift the dollargot from the lack of a move by the Deutsche Bundesbankyesterday to raise a key German interest rate. Higher Germaninterest rates could make investments denominated in marksmore attractive than those in dollars.   Without any move in German rates yesterday, currencytraders turned their attention to the likelihood that the Fedwill view any bigger-than-expected jump in unemployment as asign the economy needs more stimulus to get out of recession.   The dollar moved down &quot;on the expectation that the{unemployment} number will be bad,&quot; said Chris Manno, deputychief dealer at Midland Bank in New York.   But trading volume was light, exaggerating the dollar'sdecline. While participants in other markets, such as theU.S. bond market, were actively trading on the expectation ofa poor payroll number and a cut in U.S. interest rates, Mr.Manno said currency dealers generally were inclined to standpat.   Buying interest failed to emerge yesterday even when itfell to levels that previously had been consideredattractive. Traders said the market's underlying inclinationto hold dollars hasn't disappeared, but on the eve of apossible Fed interestrate ease, investors found scant reasonto add to their dollar positions.   Asian trading was again dominated by the presence ofseveral big speculators. The dollar hit intraday highs of1.6890 marks and 137.65 yen there as a result, withspeculators actively buying both dollars and yen against themark.   But traders started to sell the U.S. currency later in theAsian trading day and into European dealings ahead of theBundesbank Central Council's regular biweekly meeting, amidspeculation the central bank was considering raising interestrates.   After initial strength in the U.S. currency when theBundesbank said it declined to raise rates, the market againpushed the dollar lower. The bulk of the dollar's losses camewhen U.S. trading opened and after the market interpretedhigher-than-expected U.S. state unemployment claims as acurtain-raiser to Friday's jobless report.   Initial claims for state unemployment insurance surged by33,000 in the week ended March 23 to 543,000, after easing by9,000 the previous week. Also, the U.S. Labor Departmentreported that the number of people receiving benefits in theweek ended March 16, as a percentage of those covered byunemployment insurance, rose to a seven-year high of 3.3%from 3.1% a week earlier.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $359.50 an ounce, down 80 cents.Estimated volume was a light 1.6 million ounces.   Hong Kong markets were closed for a holiday Friday; a goldquote wasn't available.</TEXT></DOC>
