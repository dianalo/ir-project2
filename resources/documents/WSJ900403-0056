White   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/03/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C1</SO><CO>   LABOR</CO><IN>MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)</IN><LP>   NEW YORK -- As chief of the $56 billion California PublicEmployees Retirement System, the U.S.'s largest pension fundfor civil servants, Dale M. Hanson is giving a lot ofcorporate executives sleepless nights.   The 47-year-old Mr. Hanson has made one thrust afteranother into boardrooms across the U.S., prodding companiesto pay more attention to their giant shareholders. Just lastweek Calpers took a highly publicized stand in proxy votingagainst the management of Lockheed Corp., even though theaerospace company agreed to add as many as three board seatsfor big institutional investors.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Two or three years from now,&quot; Mr. Hanson says, &quot;hopefullywhat we're raising today won't need to be raised -- becausethe law of the land or the unwritten law of the land will bethat directors on corporate boards are fiduciariesrepresenting the interests of shareholders.&quot;   The more Mr. Hanson presses ahead, the more his criticscarp about the dangers of concentrating too much firepower inthe hands of pension funds.   &quot;I have serious questions about whether the {proxy} votingresponsibility is properly vested&quot; with fund officials suchas Mr. Hanson, says John Wilcox of the proxy solicitationfirm Georgeson andamp; Co. &quot;He's not really an owner.&quot;   Even so, Mr. Hanson isn't likely to go away, although hecomplains that shareholder-rights matters are taking &quot;toomuch of my time&quot; (about 20% of his 65-hour workweek). He andother officials of the 700-person Calpers staff are &quot;willingto take the heat from being out there in front,&quot; says PegO'Hara, head of the corporate governance services for theInvestor Responsibility Research Center in Washington.   And there's plenty of heat, even inside Mr. Hanson's owndomain at Calpers, which he joined in 1987. &quot;I personallyfeel that management of companies should be the prerogativeof management,&quot; says Jack Wickware, a lawyer for MetropolitanLife Insurance Co. who was recently named to the Calpersboard.   The powerful Calpers board, evenly split between labor andemployer members with one added trustee named by theCalifornia Legislature, decided several years ago to take anactivist bent on shareholder rights. In the mid-1980s, thestate's then treasurer, the late Jesse Unruh, became irate atthe &quot;greenmail&quot; companies were paying to buy back their stockfrom raiders -- a practice of no benefit to Calpers and othershareholders.   The board later fired its top administrator and hired Mr.Hanson, who had spent 20 years working his way up to the No.2 spot in the Wisconsin retirement system, as the firstexecutive from outside Calpers to head the California system.Although Mr. Hanson didn't bring shareholder activism toCalifornia, &quot;he quickly discovered it was the most excitingpart of the job,&quot; a colleague says.   Being willing to take the heat -- and pay the expensesconnected with shareholder activism -- has gained Calpers atleast a symbolic role in the affairs of a fast-growing listof companies.   A breakthrough occurred early last year when Texaco Inc.,rewarding Calpers for opposing raider Carl Icahn's proxyfight with the oil company, named a director from amongcandidates compiled by Calpers. The director didn't promiseCalpers anything, but the fund still could claim sometangible action by a major company. Calpers also hassponsored dozens of other shareholder rights proxyresolutions, proposed a massive overhaul of the proxy votingsystem and targeted General Motors Corp., UAL Inc. andOccidental Petroleum Corp., another big California-basedcompany, for criticism on various grounds.   There's no question that corporate America is eager tolisten to Mr. Hanson's views. Just take a look at hisappointment book for last week.   It began in Detroit, with a Monday tour of GM's TechnicalCenter at the invitation of GM Chairman Roger Smith, followedby lunch with Mr. Smith. On Tuesday, Mr. Hanson was slated torub shoulders with the chief executives of General Mills,Texaco and Champion International, among others, atChampion's Treetops company retreat in Connecticut.   On Wednesday, there was a lunch with General ElectricCo.'s Chairman Jack Welch at his invitation; Thursday it wasback to New York for investment discussions at SalomonBrothers before flying home. Friday he was in Sacramento,Calif., for a single day in the office, before he flew toWashington on Sunday for a week of lobbying and conferences.   Such a star-studded schedule is hardly typical for apublic servant, but it is becoming routine for Mr. Hanson,who has become the most visible activist for funds nationwideas they flex their $2.2 trillion in financial muscle.   Mr. Hanson maintains that Calpers' 866,000 beneficiarieshave few investment options other than to buy and hold stocksfor decades. Funds don't want to run companies, he says, butas long-term owners, they do want periodic contact withdirectors. &quot;It's the care and feeding of stockholders; if acompany has large stockholders, it's much better to knowthem&quot; before problems arise, he says.   But while a strong believer in that message, Mr. Hansonsays he is the accidental activist, taking up the role onorders from his 13-member board of trustees that decidespolicy for the Calpers system. &quot;If you told me that I wouldbe doing this corporate governance activity, I think I wouldhave looked at you in disbelief,&quot; Mr. Hanson says of hisexpectations on joining Calpers.   Mr. Hanson has been adept at winning backing from amajority of the Calpers board for his proxy-season game plan,giving him a largely free hand to try to wring outconcessions from companies. &quot;He reads the board's tea leavesvery well,&quot; says Greta Marshall, now an outside moneymanager, who worked with Mr. Hanson while she was Calpers'chief investment officer. &quot;That's to his great credit.&quot;   For example, after winning a vague promise from TexacoChief Executive James Kinnear in mid-1988 on a role for biginstitutions in picking a director, months passed withoutfurther action. By November, Mr. Hanson was ready for ashowdown with Texaco, but went back to his trustees first.   &quot;I said I want a gut check,&quot; Mr. Hanson recalls tellingthe trustees. &quot;This is what I want to push for, but I don'twant to push for it if you're not behind me. They said you'rethe closest to it, so go for it.&quot; Mr. Hanson filed a proxyresolution to form a shareholders advisory committee and seta December deadline for Texaco to act; the company agreed toa nominee from Calpers' list in January and Calpers droppedits threatened proxy squabble.   &quot;I have a very warm spot in my heart for Texaco,&quot; Mr.Hanson now says. He adds of Mr. Kinnear, &quot;He was really thefirst corporate CEO that I had any exposure to, and thatrelationship has kind of evolved&quot; to include meetings such asthose at Treetops, where Messrs. Hanson and Kinnear have meettwice in recent months with others on both sides to discussshareholder rights matters.   Such meetings have helped cool the fighting rhetoricbetween companies and Calpers. &quot;There are things Dale isdoing that I would like to talk him out of, but that isbetween him and me,&quot; says attorney Ira M. Millstein, aTreetops attendee whose clients include the BusinessRoundtable made up of corporate heavyweights.</TEXT></DOC>
