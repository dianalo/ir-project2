Joseph P, Kennedy II, D-Mass.   Responding to a question from the congressman, Ms. Achtenbergacknowledged that extension of a two-year ban on such conversionswould save money in the short-range.   ``In the long-run it is not a solution,'' said Ms. Achtenberg,who works with non-profit, low-income tenant groups to help thempreserve their homes _ either by buying the buildings themselves orworking out new rental subsidy agreements.   Because of the 1986 tax revisions that removed certain tax breaksfor rental investment property, Ms. Achtenberg said many owners ofsubsidized low-income rental properties are ``paying taxes on incomethey're not actually receiving.''   Given that situation, she said, it is not reasonable to expectthe owners to maintain the low-income units beyond the time they arelegally required to do so.   Hundreds of thousands of low-income rental units were constructedin the 1960s under a program that provided tax and other financingincentives for private developers _ but also gave them the option topay off their subsidized mortgages after 20 years and making theirproperties private.   Many of those 20-year arrangements are eligible for conversionand Ms. Achtenberg said the logical way for Congress to proceed isto arrange ``a graceful exit'' for owners who want out rather thantry to keep them in economically unfeasible arrangements.   For one thing, she said, owners in a money-losing arrangementwould not maintain the properties, leading to an even worsesituation in the future.   Although the housing and community development subcommittee thatconducted the hearing is responsible for housing policy legislation,several members noted that the appropriations committee ultimatelywould have to come up with the money to pay for whatever solution issuggested.   Kennedy noted that ``back of the envelope'' estimates have raisedthe possibility it would cost about $7.5 billion in federal money toreserve for low-income renters the units facing conversion to theprivate market.   Rep. Bruce F. Vento, D-Minn., asked the panel of advocates forlow-income rental groups whether many owners threatening conversionmight be ``bluffing'' in an effort to extract more federalassistance.   Sara Johnson, president of the National Housing Trust, said suchbluffs are not a significant factor because some of the ownersreally are in a losing financial situation because of new tax lawsand that others ``are just fed up and want to get out'' of thesubsidized housing business.</TEXT></DOC>
