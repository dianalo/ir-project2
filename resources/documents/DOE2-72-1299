Profilesof the magnetic flux are calculated for the given nonlinear pressuredependences on the magnetic flux p=p(PSI). Dependence of tau/sub N/ particleconfinement time on plasma parameters is obtained and comparison of one-dimensionalcalculations with a two-dimensional case is carried out.</TEXT></DOC>
