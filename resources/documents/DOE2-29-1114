This program coversresearch on energy efficiency improvements for the residential and commercialbuildings in this country. Improving energy efficiency of existing buildingsthrough retrofit measures offers the largest potential for energy savingsin the next 10 to 15 years in the United States. The widespread use ofretrofits for residential buildings could save 2.6 quadrillion Btu (quads)per year and reduce annual energy costs by $17 billion. Full penetrationof energy retrofits into the commercial building stock, for which initialcosts are paid back by energy savings in three years or less, could save2.5 to 3.5 quads per year and $15 to $20 billion per year. The programis working to overcome the technical, financial, and behavioral barriersto the use of building energy retrofits. The current approach is to developresearch results and predictive tools that improve confidence in expectedsavings and allow appropriate efficiency modifications to be selectedand installed. Future plans are to assess what the long-term picturefor advancing energy technologies will be and what approaches will haveto be taken to best meet the needs associated with continuing to improvethe energy efficiency of existing buildings. 61 refs., 16 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
