Greenberger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST EUROP </CO><IN> MON IND EDP </IN><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A senior Reagan administration official complained that Soviet trade overtures to the West have made the allies too eager to loosen restrictions on technology sales to East bloc nations.    Allan Wendt, the State Department's senior representative for strategic technology policy, voiced that concern as West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was visiting Moscow with West German businessmen who signed $1.5 billion in contracts with the Soviets. Mr. Wendt said that the pressure to relax trade restrictions is widespread among European allies but &quot;more pronounced&quot; in West Germany.    As the European allies rush to reap the harvest of joint ventures and other business opportunities being offered by Moscow, the emerging tensions over restrictions on technology sales could emerge as an early and thorny problem for the next U.S. president. While some Europeans are pushing for a reduction or a streamlining in technology-trade rules, the Reagan administration believes the joint ventures now being considered require closer scrutiny.    The issue also could cause domestic political problems, as U.S. companies grow restless watching their overseas competition carve out business deals in the Soviet Union.    Many Europeans are convinced that the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev no longer represents a military threat and that it is in their interest to help Mr. Gorbachev modernize his economy. The U.S., on the other hand, wants tangible changes from Moscow, such as significant reductions in Soviet conventional forces in Europe, before it agrees to loosen trade restrictions.    Mr. Wendt decried &quot;pressure to go further in the decontrol process than we believe is justified by a sober assessment of actual Soviet behavior.&quot; Briefing a small group of reporters after returning from a round of meetings in Europe, he added: &quot;I guess this problem may become more acute as time goes on.&quot;    The U.S., Japan and 14 NATO nations are joined in the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, a voluntary association that devises common export-control policies.    Mr. Wendt said he was particularly concerned about Moscow's new willingness to sign joint ventures with Western concerns. He said that even when these projects involve products that aren't controlled, they can give the Soviets access to valuable manufacturing technology that could enhance their military capability.    He noted, for example, that even before the Soviets bought milling machines from a subsidiary of Japan's Toshiba Corp., they knew how to hand-make quieter propeller shafts that make detection of submarines more difficult. But the Toshiba sale, which led the U.S. to limit Toshiba sales here, gave the Soviets the ability to produce the shafts efficiently, he said.    &quot;As joint ventures become more attractive, we have to make sure they're scrutinized,&quot; he said.    Mr. Wendt said that some Cocom members want to move quickly to liberalize the rules under which certain levels of technology could be sold to the Soviet bloc without export controls. He specifically cited the computer and machine-tool fields as two areas where such pressure is building.    Mr. Wendt said the U.S. doesn't advocate &quot;economic warfare against the Soviet Union,&quot; but rather wants to proceed slowly with an expansion of Western trade with Moscow. It would be &quot;premature to relax our guard now,&quot; he warned. </TEXT></DOC>
