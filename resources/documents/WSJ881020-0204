Browning (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> BIO </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When French Budget Minister Michel Charasse called television station La Cinq last week, he was hopping mad. Apparently worried that a comment he made about shoving drug profits down dealers' throats would reinforce his reputation for vulgarity, he told a journalist he wanted the remark kept off the air.    When she refused, the journalist says, Mr. Charasse called her and a female colleague an unprintable name and vowed revenge. At a dinner party later, the station says, he threatened to order tax audits for the station's journalists. Mr. Charasse denies the insult and threat but acknowledges the angry phone call. It was only the latest in a series of run-ins with journalists, government officials, bankers and others that in three months have thrust the cigar-chomping, plain-talking Mr. Charasse into more controversy than most budget ministers see in a lifetime. That is quite an accomplishment for someone who was almost unknown before President Francois Mitterrand named him to the cabinet in June.    A man who looks like a schoolmaster but talks like a farmer, Mr. Charasse seems an incongruous associate for the intellectual and aloof head of state. But for the past seven years he has been one of the most trusted and powerful aides at the presidential palace. A workaholic known as a deft political troubleshooter, he occasionally takes the president fishing in rural France and regularly keeps him informed about the opinions of ordinary people.    At the same time, Mr. Charasse has become a sort of court jester to the Mitterrand entourage. He regales associates with off-color witticisms and wears outlandish suspenders, decorated with large, colorful bows or with roses -- the symbol of the Socialist Party. He doesn't tone down his earthy language even in the presence of the president. &quot;He is always like that, with everyone,&quot; says a close Mitterrand adviser. &quot;It amuses the president.&quot;    The son of a printing-plant employee, Mr. Charasse got himself into Paris's respected Political Studies Institute through hard work and emerged an expert in constitutional law. But he retained a fondness for the simple people he grew up with. He still spends most weekends in his native Auvergne region, a land of tough, pennypinching folk where he serves as mayor of a small town. After spending hours in cafes and living rooms, he returns to Paris to brief the president on what he hears.    But it seems that to know Mr. Charasse is not necessarily to love him. Powerful Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy tried to prevent him from getting the budget job, officials say, then had to put up with a bit of impertinence from him. In budget talks with Prime Minister Michel Rocard, Mr. Charasse embarrassed Mr. Beregovoy, one official recalls, by interrupting him to say, &quot;Pierre, let me explain this to Michel. I understand it better than you do.&quot;    Officials say Mr. Charasse laces even official correspondence with down-home comments, an unheard-of practice in this formal country. In August, when he was required by the prime minister to approve a civil servants' pay increase, he scribbled &quot;with regret&quot; next to his signature on the decree. And when banks sought to increase credit-card charges, he annoyed the finance minister with the jibe that bankers &quot;just want to take our dough and then tell us we can't use it.&quot;    The comment that provoked his dispute with the French television station grew from a chat with reporters in the corridors of the National Assembly after French, British and U.S. authorities had announced a joint operation against a group of international bankers that they charged with laundering drug money. &quot;These guys who are poisoning our youth with drugs and who are making money on it, we'll make them eat it,&quot; he said.    He claimed the remark was made off the record. But his reported threat of tax audits provoked outrage both from journalists and from the opposition Gaullist party, and even elicited an indirect rebuke from a government spokesman.    But Mr. Charasse didn't apologize. Instead, he said, he would send &quot;big bouquets&quot; to the two journalists with notes that read: &quot;You have at least won this.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
