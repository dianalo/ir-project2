The Recommended Decision was issuedJune 1, 1987, and published in the June 8, 1987, issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [52 FR 21546].This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code and therefore is excludedfrom the requirements of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Statement</ITAG>These proposed amendments to the order were formulated on the record ofa public hearing held June 10-12, 1986, at Visalia, California to considerthe proposed further amendments of Marketing Order No. 907 [7 CFR Part907] regulating the handling of navel oranges grown in Arizona and designatedpart of California and Marketing Order No. 908 [7 CFR Part 908] regulatingthe handling of Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated part ofCalifornia, hereinafter referred to collectively as the ``orders.'' Thehearing was held pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural MarketingAgreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601-674 <T3>et seq.</T3>], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act,'' and the applicablerules of practice and procedure governing proceedings to formulate marketingagreements and marketing orders [7 CFR Part 900]. The Notice of Hearingcontained amendment proposals submitted by: The Sequoia Orange Company,Inc.; R. E. Herrick of Belridge Farms and Packing Company; the Navel andValencia Orange Administrative Committees established under the orders,hereinafter referred to collectively as the ``committees,'' and the Fruitand Vegetable Division, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), U.S. Departmentof Agriculture (USDA). The proposal pertained to committee size and composition,a limitation on tenure for members of the Valencia Orange AdministrativeCommittee, changing the basis for industry representation on the committees,inclusion of a definition of ``Capper-Volstead'' cooperatives in the orders,use of the total volume of all oranges in all outlets in determining nominatingrights, and conforming changes.Upon the basis of evidence introduced at the hearing and the record thereof,the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), on June1, 1987, filed with the Hearing Clerk, U.S. Deparmtent of Agriculture,a Recommended Decision containing a notice of the opportunity to file writtenexceptions thereto by July 8, 1987. Eleven exceptions were received. Thosefrom the committees' attorney James E. Andrews (NOAC/VOAC); the committees'manager Billy J. Peightal (Peightal); William K. Quarles, Jr., Vice President,Government Affairs, Sunkist Growers, Inc. (Sunkist); Doris S. Freedman,Director of Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA);Robert E. Herrick, Vice President, Belridge Packing Co. (Belridge); FredP. LoBue, Jr., LoBue Bros. (LoBue); and Perry L. Walker of Riverbend Farms,Inc. (Riverbend) were received within the comment period. The exceptionsfrom James A. Moody, counsel for Sequoia Orange Company, Inc. (Sequoia),and Richard J. Pescosolido, Foothill Farms (Foothill), were received latebut were considered. All exceptions were opposed to one or more aspectsof the Recommended Decision and are discussed in detail later in this document.The Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action would nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) [5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>]. As stated in the Notice of Hearing, interested personswere invited to present evidence at the hearing on the probable regulatoryand informational impact of the proposed rule on small businesses for thepurpose of the RFA.The Act requires the application of uniform rules to regulated handlers.Since handlers covered under M.O.'s 907 and 908 are predominately smallbusinesses, the orders themselves are tailored to the size and nature ofthese small businesses.It is estimated that approximately 125 handlers of California-Arizona naveloranges are regulated under Marketing Order No. 907 and approximately 115handlers of California-Arizona Valencia oranges are regulated under MarketingOrder No. 908. Given an appropriate definition of a small business concern(i.e., for purposes of review pursuant to the RFA, an agricultural servicefirm with average annual receipts not exceeding $3,500,000), almost allof the handlers of navel and Valencia oranges would fall within that definition.In addition, there are about 4,065 producers of navel oranges and 3,500producers of Valencia oranges in California and Arizona. Small agriculturalproducers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR121.2] as those having average gross annual revenues for the last threeyears of less than $500,000. The majority of California-Arizona navel andValencia orange handlers and producers may be classisfied as small entities.The proposed amendments to the orders include provisions which could giveadditional orange industry organizations representation on the committees.The first material issue proposes to authorize, but not mandate, an increasein the size of the committees from 11 up to 13 members.In separate material issue, for the Valencia orange industry, it is proposedto limit the number of consecutive terms of office which members of theValencia Orange Administrative Committee may serve to three two-year terms.(Tenure is already limited to three two-year terms. (Tenure is alreadylimited to three two-year terms for members of the Navel Orange AdministrativeCommittee.)The third material issue concerns changes in the basis for industry representationon the committees. This material issue contains several interconnected,proposed amendments which are discussed below.Three main nominating entities are proposed with the first being the ``cooperativemarketing organization,'' or at the option organization, the growers affiliatedwith that organization, which disposed of the largest percentage of thetotal volume of navel and Valencia oranges disposed of by all handlersin all outlets during the fiscal (navel oranges) or marketing (Valenciaoranges) year during which nominations are made. This differs from currentorder provisions in that this nominating entity represents the cooperativemarketing organization with the largest percentage of total dispositionsrather than 50 percent of the total volume of oranges handled. By removingthe ``in excess of 50 percent'' requirement, the proposed provision eliminatesthe present problem of there being no mechanism whereby the largest cooperativemarketing organization may nominate individuals to serve on the committeesif it handles less than 50 percent of the total volume of all oranges handled.The term ``cooperative marketing organization'' best describes the dominantmarketing organization and the exception from the NOAC/VOAC, which is discussedlater in the text, supports the use of this term.The second type of nominating entity under this proposal would be individualhandlers and groups of handlers who declare themselves to be nominatingentities. Handlers not affiliated with the largest cooperative marketingorganization would be able to combine with any other handler or handlersfor the purpose of forming nominating entities. This would give handlersflexibility to maximize their opportunities for representation on the committees.The third type of nominating entity would be comprised of growers who arenot affiliated with the largest cooperative marketing organization or withany of the declared individual handlers or declared groups of handlers.The formation of three nominating entities_the largest cooperative marketingorganization; declared handlers or groups of handlers not affiliated withthe above; and growers not affiliated with the above_would provide a moreflexible framework for apportioning committee membership.The proposed change that the first, third, fourth, and in the case of 13-membercommittees, sixth positions nominated by a nominating group are growersand the second and fifth positions are handlers would provide that at leasthalf of the members of each committee are grower members.The proposed change that nominating rights be determined on the basis ofthe current fiscal (navel oranges) or marketing (Valencia oranges) yearin which nominations are made would provide the most up-to-date informationfor determining such rights. However, a cut-off date for current-year dispositions,determined by the Secretary, will need to be established because, in someyears, it may be necessary to begin the nomination process before all shipmentshad been made.The proposed change that a simple majority would be considered as constitutinga quorum and any action of a committee would require six concurring votesfor an 11-member committee and seven concurring votes for a 12- or 13-membercommittee would be sufficient to reflect industry sentiment on all issues.The proposed change to allow declared individual handlers and declaredgroups of handlers to develop slates of candidates for their grower andhandler members on the committees with grower nominations by mail ballotingwould encourage handler interest in the orders. The proposed change to allow growers affiliated with an independent handlerentity, or an entity comprised of cooperatives and independent members,to nominate members to the committees through mail balloting would allowgrowers more opportunity to participate in the nominations of both growerand handler members. The proposed change to allow a grower to participate as a part of onlyone nominating entity regardless of the number of handlers to whom suchgrower delivered oranges would continue to allow each grower to have anequal vote in elections. Growers would be free to choose the slate of candidatesthey feel would best represent their interests. The fourth material issue which proposes including a definition of Capper-Volsteadcooperative in the orders would identify entities eligible to nominatemembers through action of their boards of directors. The fifth material issue which proposes that the volume basis for determiningnominating rights would be the total volume of oranges ``disposed of inall outlets'' would be in line with the tree crop basis which is used fordetermining prorate bases and allotments. To the extent that these proposals give industry organizations increasedrepresentation in the nominating process and on the committees, these organizationscould incur some costs. Such costs would include additional time that mightbe spent by the handler groups and growers in nominating members to thecommittees and by new committee members in completing qualification statementsand acceptance letters as required by the USDA. Another cost would be thetime required to attend committee meetings and to conduct other committeebusiness to the extent that these costs might not be fully reimbursableby the committees. However, these costs are not expected to be significantand would be offset by the benefits of the new procedures. Under the currentorder, nomination groups are rigidly fixed, and the largest cooperativemarketing organization which handled more than 50 percent of the totalvolume of oranges handled is represented by five members. The proposedprocedures would recognize the changing structure of the orange industryand allow handlers and growers to form groups with those of similar interests.In addition, the additional flexibility to increase the committee sizewould allow more representation for handlers and growers on the committees.<ITAG tagnum="84">Determination of Material Issues </ITAG>In the Recommended Decision, only one material issue was presented. Thatissue included amendment proposals concerning committee size and composition,eligibility to nominate, the number of concurring votes required to carrymotions, limitation of tenure for members of the VOAC, and conforming changes.Exceptions to this format were received form Peightal and LoBue. Foothilland Belridge support voting on the amendments as one issue, while Riverbend,Sequoia, Sunkist, and the SBA had no specific comments. Peightal statedthat in a joint meeting on June 23, 1987, the committees voted to requestthe Secretary to divide the proposed amendments into four material issues,believing that growers would be better able to differentiate between thoseissues which they support and those issues which they do not support ifthe issues were divided. The four material issues suggested were: (1) Committeesize; (2) tenure; (3) nomination procedures; and (4) adding the term ``Capper-Volsteadcooperative.'' Peightal stated that the committees secured broad industrysupport for the amendment they proposed at the June 1986 hearing. The RecommendedDecision modified those proposals, and Peightal stated that the committeesno longer have a basis to conclude that there is the suppoort that previouslyexisted. LoBue recommended that growers be allowed to vote on three separateissues: (1) Committee size; (2) nominating procedures; and (3) tenure forVOAC members. Based on the comments received, the decision was made to divide the proposalsinto the following votable issues: (1) Authorizing up to 13-member committees;(2) limiting tenure for VOAC members; (3) changing the basis of industryrepresentation on the committees; (4) including a definition of Capper-Volsteadcooperative in the orders; and (5) changing the volume basis for nominations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Conclusions </ITAG>The material issues of record are as follows: (1) Amend the orders to authorize increasing committee size up to 13 members.(2) Amend the Valencia Orange Marketing Order to limit consecutive termsof office to three two-year terms for Valencia Orange Administrative Committeemembers. (3) Amend the orders to change the basis of industry representation onthe committees by establishing new nomination procedures which includethe establishment of three types of nominating entities. (4) Amend the orders to include a definition of Capper-Volstead cooperativesto identify entities eligible to nominate members through action of theirboards of directors.(5) Amend the orders to determine nominating rights based on the totalvolume of oranges ``disposed of in all outlets.''The material issues, findings and conclusions, rulings, general findings,and regulatory provisions of the Recommended Decision published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> [52 FR 21546, June 8, 1987] are hereby incorporatedherein and made a part hereof subject to the following clarifications,modifications, and discussion:(1) Committee SizeThere were several proposals at the hearing relative to committee size,ranging from 11 to 13 members. The Recommended Decision proposed an increasein committee size from 11 to 13 members. Thirteen-member committees couldbetter reflect the diversity of the industry and yet provide a workableforum for the expression of views. Exceptions received from the NOAC/VOAC,Peightal, and LoBue were opposed to this increase. The NOAC/VOAC and Peightaldisagreed with the findings in the Recommended Decision that the preponderanceof testimony indicated there would be significant benefits derived fromadding members to the committees and indicated that there was limited supportfor 13-member committees in the industry and that the proposal would notpass in referendum. LoBue stated that an increase in committee membershipin unnecessary and burdensome, and it could be a problem for the industryto find a total of six additional regular and alternate committee memberswho are capable and willing to serve. Sequoia, Foothill, and Riverbendsubmitted briefs also opposing the USDA position unless concurrent changesin nomination and/or voting requirements were made. Sunkist had no specificcomments.Based on the exceptions, an increase in committee size is unnecessary atthis time. While enlarging the committees could increase the opportuntyfor representatives of more industry organizations to serve on the committees,an increase in the number of committee members should not be mandated.Therefore, the committees should remain at 11 members and the allocationprocess described in the Recommended Decision is modified to reflect 11-membercommittees. However, authority should be added to the orders to allow thecommittees to be increased in size through informal rulemaking to up to13 members. Such increases could be made to address any future changesin the structure of the industries. The allocation process, in the caseof a 12- or 13-member committee is discussed in material issue No. 3. Therefore,andSection;andSection; 907.20 and 908.20 should be revised to allow the committees,with the approval of the Secretary, to increase up to 13, the total numberof members on the committees.To the extent that these revisions agree with issues raised in the exceptions,their comments have been adopted. Otherwise, for the reasons stated above,the exceptions and denied.(2) Tenure and Retroactive Tenure for VOAC MembersThe Recommended Decision proposed limiting consecutive terms of officeto three two-year terms for Valencia Orange Administrative Committee (VOAC)members, including the non-industry members, and making this retroactiveto February 1, 1984. Current provisions of the order do not limit the numberof two-year terms that members may serve. Limitation of tenure could promoteincreased industry participation and involvement in the administrationof the Valencia orange marketing order. A similar tenure limitation wasimplemented in January 1985 for Navel Orange Administrative Committee (NOAC)members. Briefs filed by the NOAC/VOAC, Peightal, and LoBue were opposedto this change. They pointed out the Valencia growers rejected tenure limitationin an August 1984 referendum, and that implementation of a tenure limitationwould result in a loss of experienced members. As to the retroactive feature,all were vigorously opposed to its adoption. Opponents claimed that thiswould result in the VOAC losing all or most of its experienced membersat one time, causing major disruptions in the continuity of the administrationof the order. Sequoia and Foothill submitted briefs supporting the USDAposition, while the SBA, Riverbend, Sunkist, and Belridge had no specificcomments on this issue.Regular turnover of members on the VOAC would provide for a beneficialinput of new ideas and perspectives and promote increased industry participationand involvement in the administration of the Valencia orange marketingorder. The proposed amendment to andSection; 908.21 includes a provisionfor limiting the tenure of VOAC members, including the non-industry member,to three consecutive terms. It would serve no useful purpose to limit thetenure for alternates or additional alternates because such alternatesserve only during the absence of a member or in the event of a membersdeath, removal, resignation, or disqualification. However, under this provision,grower member would be precluded from serving as handler members, and <T3>vice versa</T3>, to extend their eligibility to serve. Therefore, andSection;908.21 should be so amended.However, in accordance with the exceptions, the proposed retroactive featureis dropped. Since all members will be nominated pursuant to new procedures,it would be appropriate to look upon the newly-formed VOAC as a completelynew committee and to begin the six consecutive year limitaion on all newmembers at the same time.The Recommended Decision discussed procedures for the possibility thatnominations could be conducted in the middle of the current terms. At thetime of publication, NOAC members were in the middle of a term while VOACmembers were ending their current term. However, the situation is now reversed.The current term of office for the NOAC ends September 30, 1988, whilethe current VOAC term of office ends January 31, 1990. Thus, nominationswill be conducted for a new NOAC term of office and in the middle of theVOAC term of office. Therefore, the procedures outlined in the RecommendedDecision are modified as follows: Nominations for the initial term of officefor the NOAC will be for the next regularly scheduled term of office whichbegins October 1, 1988. The 1988-90 term of office under the proposed committeestructure would be a full term for purposes of the tenure provision containedin andSection; 907.21.Since nominations will likely be conducted for the VOAC in the middle ofa term, the initial nomination procedure, as set out in this final decision,would create two short terms of office. It would not be appropriate tocount both partial terms as full terms for the purposes of the tenure limitationprovision nor would it be desirable to delay nominations pursuant to thisproposed amendment until early 1990 when the next regular term would begin.Therefore, the partial term of office which exceeds 12 months would beconsidered a full term of office for the purposes of the tenure provision,and the partial term of office of less than 12 months would not be considereda full term for the purposes of the tenure provision. Thus, an individualserving the shorter of the two partial terms would not be penalized bylosing one-third of that member's three-term eligibility simply becausethe committee was restructured.To the extent that these revisions agree with issues raised in the exceptions,their comments have been adopted. Otherwise, for the reasons stated above,the exceptions are denied.(3) Basis for Representation on the CommitteesSeveral interconnected, proposed amendments are included in this materialissue.<ITAG tagnum="81">Central Marketing Organization</ITAG>The Recommended Decision proposed three nominating entities, the firstbeing the ``central marketing organization'' with the largest percentageof total dispositions rather than the ``cooperative marketing organization''which handled more than 50 percent of the total volume of oranges handled.The NOAC/VOAC filed an exception to the use of the term ``central marketingorganization.'' They stated in their exception that the term ``cooperativemarketing organization'' is well understood, thus the proposed change wouldcreate confusion. No other comments were received concerning this term.Currently, the largest central marketing organization in the orange industrieswould qualify as nominating entity 1. It is well understood in the industriesthat that entity is referred to as the largest ``cooperative marketingorganization.'' The exception points out that confusion may exist betweenthe terms ``central marketing organization'' and ``cooperative marketingorganization.'' Therefore, to avoid confusion and in recognition of currentindustry use, the first nominating entity will be referred to as the largest``cooperative marketing organization.''To the extent that these revisions agree with issues raised in the exception,the comments have been adopted. Otherwise, for the reasons stated above,the exception is denied.<ITAG tagnum="81">Nominating Entities</ITAG>The Recommended Decision proposed three nominating entities: (1) The largestcentral marketing organization (which is now described as the largest cooperativemarketing organization); (2) declared handlers or groups of handlers notaffiliated with the above; and (3) growers not affiliated with either ofthe above. Exceptions to this proposal were received from Sequoia, Foothill,and LoBue. These exceptions stated that the proposal was cumbersome, unnecessary,and could violate antitrust laws. Sequoia pointed out that this procedurewould require an extreme amount of time and effort to form handler groupsand that all of the effort would be borne by the smaller handlers, as SunkistGrowers, Inc. and Central California Orange Growers Cooperative (CCOGC)already have defined entities. Foothill stated that this proposal allowsentities which are protected under the Capper-Volstead Act to share marketstrategy and planning with entities that are not protected. Lobue disagreedwith a perceived requirement that would force handlers whose growers belongto cooperatives which do not centrally market to participate in one nominatingentity.In response to the Sequoia comment, the second group of nominating entitieswould be comprised of handlers who first handle oranges. While it is truethat the grouping of handlers for nomination purposes will call for anexpenditure of time and effort on the part of handlers who choose to formnominating entities, the result of that expenditure would be increasedrepresentation on the committees for those handlers. This provision doesnot require handlers to participate in the formation of nominating entities.Thus, those handlers who find no benefit in such procedures may chose notto utilize them. Growers who deliver oranges to such handlers would thenbe able to seek committee representation under nomination group three (growersnot affiliated with the major cooperative or a declared nominating entity).In reference to the LoBue exception, handlers who market for cooperativesare not required to form nominating entities only with other such handlers.Handlers who market oranges for CCOGC, for example, would not be requiredto form a nominating entity only with other handlers who market orangesfor CCOGC. In addition, marketers of fruit who are not first handlers arenot eligible to form nominating groups.As to Foothill's comments, nominating groups are formed for nominationpurposes only. The fact that such groups are formed does not authorizemembers of such groups to engage in activities that could violate antitrustlaws.For the reasons stated above, the exceptions are denied. <ITAG tagnum="81">Grower-Member Formula</ITAG>The Recommended Decision proposed that when the first and second categoriesof nominating entities made nominations, the first position nominated wouldbe a grower position, the second a handler, the third a grower, and soforth. Such an apportionment would have provided that at least half ofthe committee members would be grower members. Sequoia and LoBue filedexceptions to this proposal. Sequoia stated that the alternate allocation of grower and handler seatsto each handler group could lead to six or more handlers on the committees.LoBue stated that the proposed amendments could put the growers in a minorityon their own administrative committees. While the proposal as containedin the Recommended Decision could have resulted in six handlers on a 13-membercommittee, there would have been no possible situation in which there weremore than six handler members on a committee. However, record evidence supports that it is desirable that growers bein the majority on the committees. Thus, a revised method of allocatinggrower/handler positions should be adopted. The first, third, fourth, andin the case of 13-member committees, sixth positions nominated by category1 or 2 nominating entities would be filled by growers; the second and fifthpositions would be filled by handlers. This change would result in growershaving a majority on the committees except in the unlikely event that onlynominating entity 2 groups are formed, each with the right to nominateeven numbers of members. In that case, membership on the committees couldbe six grower members and six handler members. Proposed andSection;andSection;907.20(d)(1) and 908.20(d)(1) as contained in the Recommended Decisionhave been revised to reflect the changes described above. For an 11-member committee, members will be allocated in a method similarto that described in the Recommended Decision. Each nominating entity wouldearn the right to nominate one member, one alternate member and one additionalalternate member, for each 10.0 percent attributable to such entity ofthe total volume of oranges disposed of by all handlers in all outletsduring the current fiscal year (navels) or marketing year (Valencias) inwhich nominations are made. This method would apply when no entity in thelargest cooperative marketing organization category, or the declared handlersor groups of declared handlers category has more than 50 percent of totaldispositions. When one of these entities has more than 50 percent of total dispositions,that entity would qualify for no more than five committee members and theiralternates. The following formula would be used to determine the percentageof the remaining total volume of dispositions required of other entitiesto qualify to nominate a member:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,22,2,15</C> <H1>50%^(excess over 50%)</H1><H2>5</H2><H1>=</H1><H1>Percentage required to nominate one member, one alternate, and oneadditional alternate</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>This formula is necessary due to the five-member limitation. Under themethod whereby a nominating entity earns the right to nominate one memberfor each 10.0 percent of total dispositions, such entity would reach thefive-member limit at 50 percent of total dispositions. If such entity controlsmore than 50 percent of total dispositions, the amount such entity controlsabove 50 percent could not be used by that entity to earn further committeerepresentation. In this case, rights to nominate the remaining five handleror grower members should be apportioned over the remaining volume of dispositions,which would equal less than 50 percent of total dispositions. The aboveformula would provide other entities with the right to nominate one member,one alternate member and one additional alternate member, for each one-fifthof the remaining volume of total dispositions controlled by such entities.For example, if the largest cooperative marketing organization (Group A)controls 58 percent of total dispositions, two declared handler groups(Groups B and C) control 24 and 7 percent of total dispositions, respectively,and the unaffiliated growers (Group D) control 11 percent of dispositions,the members would be allocated as follows: The number of seats which thelargest cooperative marketing organization may nominate is limited to five.Because the largest cooperative marketing organization controls more than50 percent of total dispositions, the percentage required to nominate eachmember, plus an alternate member and additional alternate member for theremaining entities, is calculated as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,8,7</C> <H1>50%^8%</H1><H2>5</H2><H1>= 8.4%</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>The following table shows member allocation to the four groups: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,tp0,i1,s25,4,4,4,4,6</C> <H1>Groups </H1><H1>A</H1><H1>B</H1><H1>C</H1><H1>D</H1><H1>Totals</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Percent controlled<D>58</D><D>24</D><D>7</D><D>11</D><D>100% disposition.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Number of seats allocated based on 8.4% per seat<D>5</D><D>3</D><D>1</D><D>1</D><D>10</D></ITAG></ITAG>If the committees, with the aproval of the Secretary, increase committeesize to 12- or 13-member committees, then the percentage of total dispositionsrequired by an entity to nominate one member, one alternate member, andone additional alternate member would be 9.09 percent and 8.33 percent,respectively, in the case of an entity in the largest cooperative marketingorganization category, or the declared handlers or groups of declared handlerscategory having more than 50 percent of total dispositions, such entitywould be limited to five members on a 12-member committee and 6 memberson a 13-member committee. In either case, six member positions would remainto be allocated among other entities. In order to allocate the remainingsix positions, the following formula would be used:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,22,2,15</C> <H1>50%_(excess over 50%)</H1><H2>6</H2><H1>=</H1><H1>Percentage required to nominate one member, one alternate, and oneadditional alternate</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>As in the example for an 11-member committee, this formula would providethe percentage of total dispositions required of an entity to qualify tonominate a member, alternate member and additional alternate member.To the extent that these revisions agree with issues raised in the exceptions,their comments have been adopted. Otherwise, for the reasons stated above,the exceptions are denied.<ITAG tagnum="81">Non-Industry Member</ITAG>The Recommended Decision did not adopt the proposed changes in the qualificationand selection criteria for non-industry members. Exceptions were receivedfrom Sequoia, Foothill, and Riverbend. Sequoia stated that the positionfor a non-industry member should be abolished or made a ``truly responsivepublic position.'' Sequoia further stated that, in its present state, theposition serves no useful purpose and is harmful to the interests of thepublic at large and minority interests in the industry. Foothill statedthat the non-industry member should not be selected by the committees butby the Secretary from nominees submitted by all interested groups exceptthe committees. Riverbend stated that the non-industry member should representconsumer interests, and that each committee should submit to the Secretaryone nominee who was selected unanimously. Then, if no unanimous selectionis made, all nominees should be submitted to the Secretary for selectionby the Secretary.Non-industry members are persons who are not growers or handlers, or employees,agents, or representatives of a grower or handler, or of a central marketingorganization, as is required by andSection;andSection; 907.22(f) and 908.22(f)of the respective orders. The non-industry member provides an independentpoint of view in committee deliberations. The USDA carefully reviews andanalyzes all nominees for non-indutry member positions on all committeesto ensure that their qualifications are in compliance with order requirements.In response to Riverbend's exception, the current procedure provides thatthe committees shall choose nominees for the non-industry member positionsand allows (but does not require) the Secretary to either approve the individualnominees or to select from other qualified candidates. This procedure providesfor committee input into the nomination process. The discretion to selectappropriate members rests with the Secretary.For the reasons stated above, the exceptions are denied.<ITAG tagnum="81">Determination of Nomination Rights on the Current or Prior Fiscal(Navel Oranges) or Marketing (Valencia Oranges) Year</ITAG>The Recommended Decision proposed that nominating rights be determinedon the basis of the fiscal (navel oranges) or marketing (Valencia oranges)year prior to that in which nominations are made. Currently, the marketingorders prescribe that this calcultion be made on the basis of the currentfiscal (naval oranges) or marketing (Valencia oranges) year. In the caseof both navel and Valencia oranges, it has often been necessary to usethe information on shipments for a partial year in order to ensure thatnominations are made in time to select a new committee in a timely manner.The proposal sought to provide a sufficient period of time to conduct nominationsafter the percentages are computed on the basis of a full year and beforethe term of office begins. Exceptions to this proposal were received fromthe NOAC/VOAC, LoBue and Sequoia. These exceptions proposed using currentyear dispositions as this would give the most up-to-date information. TheNOAC/VOAC and LoBue stated that the industry is and has always been ina continuous state of change and committee membership should reflect thisin as timely as a manner as possible.The Recommended Decision did not provide for the use of current year dispositionsfor fear that the failure to utilize end-of-season shipments could alterentities' volume percentages. However, it has been determined that suchend-of-season shipments are usually quite low in volume and their exclusionwould not be expected to alter the relative percentages of dispositionsbetween industry entities. Accordingly, this proposed rule provides foruse of current year dispositions.Because it may be necessary to begin the nomination process before allshipments have been made, a cut-off date for current year depositions,determined by the Secretary, should be established. Using the most currentinformation available would best reflect the changing structure of theindustries and provide the most representative committees possible. Aftergaining experience in the revised nomination process, the committees mayfind that particular times each season would be most appropriate as thecut-off dates. Thus, the committees should be authorized, subject to theapproval of the Secretary, to recommend such dates to be used each yearfor nomination purposes. To the extent that these revisions agree with issues raised in the exceptions,their comments have been adopted. Otherwise, for the reasons stated above,the exceptions are denied. <ITAG tagnum="81">Voting</ITAG>The Recommended Decision proposed that seven votes (a simple majority)on a 13-member committee would be considered as constituting a quorum andthat seven affirmative votes would be necessary to pass any committee motion.Riverbend and Belridge filed the only exceptions to this proposal. Riverbend proposed that a ``super-majority'' of nine affirmative votesshould be required to initiate prorate during a season. After ten weeksof regulation, a unanimous committee vote should be required to continueany existing prorate regulation. Belridege suggested that the committeemembers must be able to agree by more than a simple majority vote.A ``super-majority'' requirement that up to three-fourths of the committeebe required to pass a motion would enable a small portion of the industryto nullify the views of the majority. The current proposal ensures thatno one entity will have a majority of seats on a committee. On an 11-membercommittee, no one entity would have more than five seats, and six votesare required to pass a motion. Therefore, the ``super majority'' requirementappears to be unnecessarily stringent, considering the nature of committeedeliberations and voting history. For the reasons stated above, these exceptions are denied. While the proposal in the Recommended Decision was drafted in terms ofa 13-member committee, this proposal would require a simple majority, regardlessof committee size, to constitute a quorum. Thus, in the case of an 11-membercommittee, six members shall constitute a quorum and any committee actionshall require at least six concurring votes and in the case of 12- or 13-membercommittees, seven members shall constitute a quorum and any committee actionshall require at least seven concurring votes. <ITAG tagnum="81">Selection of Grower and Handler Members</ITAG>The Recommended Decision proposed that growers affiliated with an independenthandler entity or an entity comprised of Capper-Volstead cooperatives andindependent handlers should nominate grower members to the committees.The committees had proposed that handlers select slates of candidates fornomination. The Recommended Decision also proposed allowing declared individualhandlers and declared groups of handlers (that is, individual or groupsof handlers who declare themselves to be nominating entities), to nominatehandler members without grower ratification. The NOAC/VOAC filed the onlyexception. They stated that the recommended nomination procedures woulddiscourage the formation of handler coalitions since handlers would beexcluded from participation in grower-member nominations, and growers wouldbe excluded from participating in handler-member nominations. In addition,the NOAC/VOAC stated that the procedure would be too time consuming andcomplex. The NOAC/VOAC comment advocates handler selection of grower andhandler slates of candidates with grower approval in a ratification process.In accordance with record evidence, growers should have more opportunityto participate in the nomination of both grower and handler members. Inconsidering the exceptions of the NOAC/VOAC, it was determined that thisnomination procedure should be amended to allow verifiable grower participation.Thus, handlers' coalitions should be allowed, with the input of the growersthey represent, to develop slates of grower and handler candidates fornomination. Such slates would be developed by single nominating entitiesor handler coalitions comprising a nominating entity. After nominatingentities are informed by the USDA of the number and type of members theirentity would be authorized to nominate, the handlers involved would consulttheir growers and develop a slate of candidates for nomination containing,at a minimum, one eligible candidate for each member, alternate member,and additional alternate member for each position the coalition is allowed.The USDA would use the slate of candidates for nomination, developed byeach nominating entity, for mail balloting among those growers who deliveredtheir fruit to the handler or group of handlers which make up that nominatingentity. Since the cooperative marketing organization which makes up nominatingentity 1 may choose to allow their growers to vote directly rather thanto nominate by vote of their board of directors, this procedure would alsoapply to a grower vote of nominating entity 1 growers. Thus, the RecommendedDecision is modified to allow handlers in nominating entities 1 and 2 todevelop slates of candidates for nomination with grower ratification bymail balloting conducted by the USDA. In addition, growers affiliated withsuch handlers would be able to nominate by writing in candidates' nameson the mail ballots. At the hearing, the NOAC/VOAC proposed a method whereby handlers wouldconduct mail balloting among their own growers and certify the resultsto the USDA. Using this method, however, the USDA would be unable to ascertainif all growers had been contacted and unable to review the results of theballoting. Therefore, mail balloting of growers should be conducted bythe USDA. Such balloting should also allow for write-in candidates. Inthe case of a nominating entity being a cooperative, the cooperative'sboard of directors should be allowed to decide on its nominees. In nominatingentities made up of cooperatives and independents, mail balloting wouldbe conducted among all growers affiliated with the nominating entity. Furtherauthority should be included to allow the committees to recommend, subjectto the approval of the Secretary, regulations to implement these nominationprocedures. To the extent that these revisions agree with issues raised in the exceptions,their comments have been adopted. Otherwise, for the reasons stated above,the exceptions are denied. The USDA will conduct the initial committee nominations using interim proceduresto be developed. Such procedures will include notifying handlers of theirvolume percentages and the percentages required to be allocated memberpositions; requesting the formation of handler coalitions; determiningthe number of members each nominating entity will receive and notifyingeach nominating entity of such number; requesting slates of candiates fornominations from nominating entities 1 and 2; holding candidate selectionmeetings for nominating entity 3 growers; mailing ballots to growers innominating entities 1, 2, and 3; and tallying the results of such mailballoting.<ITAG tagnum="81">Grower Participation In One Or More Nominating Entities</ITAG>The Recommended Decision proposed that if a grower delivers fruit to morethan one declared handler or group of handlers, the grower would vote forgrower members to represent the nominating entity to which the grower deliveredthe greatest volume of fruit. Therefore, a grower could participate asa part of only one nominating entity regardless of the number of handlersto whom oranges were delivered. An exception to this proposal was filedby the NOAC/VOAC. Under the NOAC/VOAC's initial proposals, grower votingwould be weighted within each handler entity based on each grower's percentageof all oranges handled by such handlers in such entity. Thus, a growerdelivering oranges to more than one entity could have participated in thenominating process of each such entity on a weighted basis. The NOAC/VOACstated that this is a better procedure than the Recommended Decision'sproposal because it is far less difficult and costly to administer, andit would ensure that growers are not ``disenfranchised'' with regard topart of their tonnage.The NOAC/VOAC proposal could provide those growers with greater productiona greater voice in the nominating process than those with less production.Under the orders, each grower has an equal vote in nominations. Weightingthe votes of growers could subordinate the interests of smaller growersto those of larger growers in committee decisionmaking.Growers should choose the nominating entity in which they desire to casttheir vote if they deliver oranges to more than one such entity. Growerswould be free to choose the slate of candidates they felt would best representtheir interests. The USDA would ensure that growers vote for only one slateof candidates. The provision entitling each grower one vote as proposedin the Recommended Decision should remain unchanged.For the reasons stated above, the exception is denied.(4) Capper-Volstead CooperativesThe Recommended Decision proposed that in the case of Capper-Volstead cooperativeswhich declare themselves as nominating entities, the cooperatives' boardsof directors could nominate committee members. The NOAC/VOAC filed an exceptionto this proposal, stating that each Capper-Volstead cooperative is controlledby its own by-laws with regard to voting and that ``there is no reasonto force those handlers to act as a unit through a Board of Directors.''As stated in the Recommended Decision, Capper-Volstead cooperatives whichdeclare themselves to be nominating entities are not required to nominatecommittee members through their boards of directors. If they so choose,the cooperatives' boards of directors may authorize their growers to nominatedirectly. Handlers who market for cooperatives other than the largest cooperativemarketing organization, are not required to form nominating entities onlywith other such handlers. For example, a handler who markets oranges fora cooperative would not be required to be in the same nominating entityas other handlers who market for that cooperative. The handler could joinanother nominating entity and that handler's growers would be part of thenew nominating entity for the purposes of nominations.For the reasons stated above, the exception is denied. The definition of Capper-Volstead cooperatives should be made a part ofthe order. Currently, such a definition is found in andSection;andSection;907.104(a)(1) and 908.104(a)(1) of the administrative rules and regulationsof the navel and Valencia orange marketing orders, respectively. For purposesof clarifying the orders, the definition should be added to the order ascontained in the Recommended Decision.(5) Volume Basis for Determining Nominating RightsThe first nominating entity, the largest cooperative marketing organization,is also referred to as the organization which disposed of the largest percentageof the total volume of navel or Valencia oranges disposed of by all handlersin all outlets during the fiscal (naval oranges) or marketing (Valenciaoranges) year prior to that in which nominations are made. This differsfrom current order provisions in that this nominating entity representsthe cooperative marketing organization with the largest percentage of totaldispositions rather than the cooperative marketing organization which handledmore than 50 percent of the total volume of oranges handled, as currentlyprovided in andSection;andSection; 907.22(b) and 908.22(b) of the navel andValencia orange marketing orders, respectively. The Recommended Decisionproposed that the volume basis for determining nominating rights wouldbe the total volume of oranges ``disposed of in all outlets'' rather thanthe volume of oranges ``handled to fresh domestic channels, including Canada''as currently specified in the orders. Total dispositions to all outletswould include by-products, animal feed, charitable donations, and exportsin addition to fresh domestic shipments. Exceptions to this proposal werefiled by Sequoia, Riverbend, the SBA, and Belridge. No other comments onthis proposal were received. Sequoia suggested that this proposal is contraryto law because it would allow voting rights for unregulated oranges andfavors large entities, those in District 2 (with the capacity to export)and entities with juice plants. Sequoia stated that the Recommended Decisiongives no justification for this radical departure from current practice.Riverbend felt that establishing nomination rights by total tree crop wouldskew committee representation away from growers who are most effected byprorate and towards growers who are least affected. The SBA suggested thatthe use of total dispositions as a basis for nominations would tend tofavor the largest central marketing organization on the committees andthat it would permit growers and handlers not subject to regulation tohave a greater voice in determining whether the committees would recommendthe imposition of volume controls in the fresh domestic market. Belridgestated that by using total dispositions, unregulated oranges would determinewho is regulated and how they are regulated. They also suggested that itwould be unfair for districts with no regulation to participate in decidingthe amount of regulation to be imposed on competing regulated districts.The use of total dispositions in all outlets for all nominating entitieswould be in line with the tree crop basis which is used for determiningprorate bases and allotments. Further, while exported fruit and fruit thatis processed into juice or otherwise utilized is not regulated under themarketing orders, the market for such fruit and subsequent dispositionof such fruit has an impact upon the fresh domestic market and committeedeliberations on the need for and level of regulation. In addition, ifonly fresh domestic shipments are used in determining nominating rights,the rights of an individual nominating entity could be voided by an unusualevent, such as a freeze, which could affect the suitability of fruit forthe fresh market but not for other outlets.Therefore, it has been determined that the use of total dispositions inall outlets would more accurately reflect each entity's proportion of theindustry and impact on the industry in general. Further, this provisionwould increase the potential for each committee as a whole to reflect theindustries as a whole. In order for the committees to make decisions forthe benefit of the industries at large, it is necessary for the committeesto have at their disposal in the decisionmaking process the experienceand knowledge of the industries at large.For the reasons stated above, the exceptions are therefore denied.If this issue (use of total dispositions) fails in referendum, nominatingrights would then be determined as currently defined in the orders, thatis, on the basis of the total volume of oranges handled in fresh domesticchannels, including Canada, during the fiscal (navel oranges) or marketing(Valencia oranges) year in which nominations are made.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conforming Changes</ITAG>A proposal in the notice of hearing by the USDA was that considerationbe given to making such other changes in the orders as may be necessaryto make the entire orders conform to any amendments that may result fromthis proceeding. This proposal was received at the hearing without opposition,and such changes as are necessary will be incorporated into the orders.In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter35), the changes in the recordkeeping and reporting provisions that areincluded in the proposed order will be submitted for approval to the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB). They would not become effective prior toOMB approval.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulings on Exceptions</ITAG>In arriving at the findings and conclusions and the regulatory provisionsof this decision, the exceptions to the Recommended Decision were carefullyconsidered in conjunction with the record evidence.
