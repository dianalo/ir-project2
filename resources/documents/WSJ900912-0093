The commissioner, Roxani M. Gillespie, yesterday orderedGovernment Employees Insurance Co., or Geico, to stoprefusing to insure radar-detector owners in the state, sayingthe practice violates California's insurance law. TheWashington, D.C., company had requested a hearing after amotorist lodged a complaint last year charging that Geicowouldn't renew his insurance after he confessed in aquestionnaire that he packed a radar detector in one of histhree cars.</LP><TEXT>   Ms. Gillespie found in her decision that Geico hadpresented, &quot;No credible evidence . . . that radar detectorusers as a class are high-speed drivers or that as a classthey tend to drive in a manner which endangers the safety ofthemselves or others.&quot;   Geico won't appeal the decision immediately, but willcollect better data and &quot;will eventually prevail&quot; in provingthe connection between radar detectors and accidents, saidTony Nicely, the company's president. Insurance departmentsin Maryland and five other states require insurance companiesto sell policies to radar-detector owners, Mr. Nicely said,but Geico refuses insurance to such owners in 42 other statesbecause &quot;we know of no other plausible use of a radardetector than to exceed speed laws.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
