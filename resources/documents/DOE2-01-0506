<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-01-0506 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new functional approach to the stochastic quantisation of continuumEuclidean Yang-Mills field theory is presented. Non-negative integralrepresentations for the non-equilibrium and equilibrium probability distributionsare given. A new dynamical generating function is proposed and its equilibriumlimit is obtained. The new dynamical Feynman rules for the generatingfunction are derived and the superficial renormalisability of the theoryis studied. Euclidean volume divergences appear. The cancellations ofthe latter for any Euclidean dimension d, and, for d = 4, that of allquartic ultraviolet divergences, are carried out.</TEXT></DOC>
