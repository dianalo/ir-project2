But there's a (need for a) gatekeeper,'' he said Friday.   A computer virus is a program that ``infects'' other programs bymodifying them to include a copy of itself. It can spread from onecomputer to another and alter or destroy data.   Viruses are usually communicated by data transmission over phonelines, or by someone inserting a contaminated floppy disk into acomputer.   A virus that swept the country this week temporarily crippled thecomputing centers of many universities and research centers.Business began to return to normal Friday as computer operatorscleaned out copies of the rapidly multiplying program.   In attempts to control viruses, there will be much stricterlimits on who can use certain programs and data bases and under whatconditions. This will make it harder for people to work together incomputer networks.   New pieces of software, no matter how seemingly beneficial, willbe tested at length, especially if they come from insecure sources.   Certain programs that check for evidence of contamination will berun every time someone sits down to use a piece of software, causingfrustrating delays.   There could even be delays in everyday activities such as using acredit card.   In short, steps to protect against computer viruses may draincomputers of two of their most important attributes: speed andaccessibility.   Even with time-consuming and expensive precautions, viruses willremain a problem.   Once a computer has been contaminated with a virus it is almostimpossible to ensure that every trace of the virus has beeneradicated, said Mary Carol Chruscicki, program manager for systemreliability at a Rome, N.Y., institute that performs studies for theDefense Department.   Some people have expressed concern that the danger of computerviruses will turn the clock back to the days when the only computerswere mainframes in locked ``glass houses,'' operated by people inwhite coats.   Ms. Chruscicki said she does not think that will happen.   ``The world of information is here and computer users don't wantto go back to where they're sheltered from what's out there, whetherit's a low-cost product or a free product,'' she said.   ``The key issue is that with proper precautions, one can continueto live a normal existence,'' said Delbert Jones of the National LANLaboratory in Reston, Va.   More than 60 companies this week endorsed a set of guidelinesdrafted by the National LAN Laboratory that are intended to preventand control viruses.   Among the recommendations:   _All software should be purchased from known, reputable sources.   _New software should be quarantined on an isolated computer fortesting.   _Back-up copies of all master software and computer data shouldbe made at least once a month so the back-ups can be used if thecurrent versions are corrupted by a virus.   ``It's very much like the AIDS virus: The best solution isprecaution,'' Jones said.</TEXT></DOC>
