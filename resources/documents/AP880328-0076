(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Baby M is happy and secure with herfather and his wife and shows no more attachment to the surrogatemother who refused to surrender her than she does to herbabysitter, the toddler's father testified today.   William Stern, testifying at a court hearing over visitationrights for surrogate mother Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould, said hebelieves his daughter should not be allowed to see Mrs.Whitehead-Gould for several years.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who agreed to bear the child under a$10,000 contract with Stern, currently is allowed to see the childonce a week for two hours under supervision.   The visitation fight is the final legal phase of the courtbattle involving Baby M, now Melissa Stern, who turned 2 Sunday.The court hearing was ordered in a landmark ruling by the NewJersey Supreme Court overturning surrogacy for pay.   Both sides in the dispute strongly disagree over what would bein the best interest of the girl, with the key issue centering onwhether continued contact with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould would beharmful or healthy.   The child, conceived by artificial insemination using Stern'ssperm, lives with Stern and his wife, Elizabeth, in their Tenaflyhome.   Stern likened Melissa to a young sapling that has to put downits roots.   ``If anything is done to interrupt her putting down those roots,I'm afraid Melissa does not have much of a future,'' he said duringa half-hour of testimony.   Melissa calls him ``Dada,'' and his wife, ``Mama,'' he noted.   Stern acknowledged under cross-examination by Mrs.Whitehead-Gould's attorney, Joel Siegal, that Melissa appeared tobe suffering no ill effects from her visits with Mrs.Whitehead-Gould, and he said he would be willing to try to work outa visitation arrangement if the court ordered one.   ``The critical thing is that these adults can get on with theirlives, put the conflicts of the past behind them and support oneanother,'' said Dr. David Brodzinsky, who acted as acourt-appointed psychologist in the widely publicized 1986 trialthat marked the first court ruling on a surrogacy contract.   The judge in that trial barred Mrs. Whitehead-Gould from seeingMelissa, but on Feb. 3 the state Supreme Court declared surrogacyfor pay illegal and restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's parentalrights, while granting custody to the Sterns.   The Supreme Court, in ordering today's visitation hearing, madeno specific recommendations on visitation and gave the lower courtthe ``broadest powers'' to resolve the issue.   Mental health experts who have examined Melissa say she appearsto be unaffected by the legal storm around her. She was describedas friendly with adults, while being more attached to Stern than toher mother.   In court papers filed last week, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould says shewants liberal, unsupervised visitation. The Sterns are seeking ahalt to visitation for several years.   The session before Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween isexpected to last about three days. The high court ruled that theissue of visitation must be resolved by early May.   In court papers, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould says she wants visitationimmediately expanded to eight hours twice a week, unsupervised ather home in East Brunswick. She says she wants the visitseventually to include half the summer and some holidays.   ``Mrs. Whitehead-Gould has fashioned an excellent relationshipwith Melissa and is devoted to promoting an even more flourishingand productive relationship,'' according to papers filed by herattorney, Harold Cassidy.   But the Sterns' attorney, Gary Skoloff, argues in court papersthat no contact would be better for the child because Mrs.Whitehead-Gould does not offer a healthy environment for her,particularly in the last year since the mother became pregnant outof wedlock, divorced her former husband and married Wall Streetaccountant Dean Gould.   Skoloff did not spell out in the court papers how long contactshould be discontinued. In an interview, he said ``as long aspossible,'' and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys say the Sterns areseeking a six-year moratorium on visits.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's attorneys see her divorce and remarriagein a positive light, arguing that she has a more stablerelationship and financially secure lifestyle.</TEXT></DOC>
