Gorbachev'spolicy of greater openness.   Vadim A. Medvedev, who was named to the ruling Communist PartyPolitburo by Gorbachev in September and immediately given controlover ideology and propaganda, also indicated there would be nolessening of control over the mass media.   ``People are concerned about hysteria, sensationalism, thedestructive direction of some statements, the inciting of passions,lack of regard for the facts, a deficit of professionalism,'' andother tendencies in the Soviet press, Medvedev said in a speech tolocal party officials in Kazan.   ``The mass media must obey general laws, develop in the frameworkof the laws of socialist government,'' he said. A new law on thepress is being written, but ``no law can take away the civicposition, the party responsibility of the leaders of the mass media,of our entire journalistic body.''   His comments at the Dec. 23-24 conference were published Mondayby the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.   State-controlled press and publishers have used the newatmosphere of greater freedom under Gorbachev to publish materialthat were not acceptable or were banned for years under Gorbachev'spredecessors.   But since taking control over the party's ideology and propagandaapparatus, Medvedev also has signaled that ``glasnost,'' the policyof greater openness, has definite limits.   On Nov. 29, Medvedev told a news conference that he opposedpublication of works by exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn becausethey would undermine Soviet society. Some writers, artists andactivists in informal political groups have been clamoring forpublication of works by the Nobel-prize winning author who wasstripped of his citizenship and exiled in 1974.   Medvedev's speech was one of a series published by Pravda onMonday by top party leaders at regional conferences reviewing localparty membership in accord with a directive from the June CommunistParty conference to cleanse party rolls of people who were standingin the way of Gorbachev's reform policies.   Medvedev also criticized party and government traditionalists,who he said were standing in the way of Gorbachev' reforms. He saidthe party was trying to steer a course between extremists who wantedno reform and those who wanted too much, too fast.   His statement contrasted with a speech in the Ural Mountains cityof Perm two weeks ago by Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev, whoemphasized the need for more democracy and openness.   ``Democracy, glasnost and differences of opinion still frightenus, as if every one of us constantly lives in agreement with himselfand always thinks in comfortable cliches,'' said Yakovlev,considered the Politburo member closest to Gorbachev. ``Can youreally call a person a person if he doesn't have his own opinions?''Yakovlev asked.   Pravda said Medvedev's comments on the Soviet media referred to afew publications it did not identify. But they most likely referredto the handful of journals and newspapers that have been pushing thefrontiers of Gorbachev's glasnost policy to publish revelationsabout Soviet history and social problems that previously never wouldhave surfaced in the official press.   Leading those publications are the weeklies Ogonyok and MoscowNews. More conservative publications continue to publish lesscontroversial material, except for several instances in which opendisputes have broken out in the pages of the official media betweenprogressive and traditional papers.   The accusation that some publications were inciting passions alsowas likely aimed at local newspapers in the Baltic republics and inthe southern republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.   In both places the official media accused local media of addingto ethnic rather than quieting it.   Medvedev also served notice on informal political organizationsthat have sprung up outside the Communist Party that they will betolerated only as long as they do not run counter to party policy.   Medvedev said the informal groups are a ``natural part of theprocess of restructuring.'' Some people, he said, are using a``healthy process for establishing and movement of anti-socialistgoals.''   ``Our main criterion for determining relations with autonomousorganizations is their correspondence with the goals ofrestructuring, ideological renewal, socialist choice,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
