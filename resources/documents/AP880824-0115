Quayle's Day</HEAD><BYLINE>By DAVID L. LANGFORD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Guard these days is no good placeto hide from a war.   In the years since Republican vice presidential nominee DanQuayle joined the Guard in Indiana in 1969, America's oldestmilitary organization has been made a full partner in the nationaldefense with the regular Army.   Under the Pentagon's Total Force battle plan, which came tofruition in the Reagan years, some National Guardsmen would be onthe front lines in a war in just a few days, with most of the restof Guard combat units to follow within 30 to 60 days.   Some would reach the battlefield even before their regular Armycounterparts.   ``It was not but a few years ago that they said we couldn'tfight our way out of a wet paper bag, and here we're on thespearhead of an invasion,'' says Lt. Gen. Herbert R. Temple Jr.,chief of the National Guard Bureau, the liaison with the DefenseDepartment. ``Baby, we've come a long way. And seeing the kids outthere, I don't know of any that say, `Hell, no, I won't go.'''   Even with the threat of being drafted no longer a factor _conscription ended in 1972 _ the Guard is at its greatest strengthin its 352-year history, with 451,900 soldiers in 2,043 units,greater even than during the Vietnam War.   The militia that first fought for its homeland at Bunker Hilland has fought in every American war has also emerged into an``International Guard.'' Over the past few years half a millionGuardsmen have trained overseas _ in Asia, Europe, Greenland andAfrica, as well as South America and Central America.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Minnesota Gov. RudyPerpich went to court to block the dispatch of their states'Guardsmen to Central America, but failed.   Under an Army battle plan called Capstone, National Guardsmenand Army Reservists will comprise roughly half the manpower of theTotal Force in event of war.   ``The Army cannot go to war without the National Guard and theyrecognize this,'' says Maj. Gen. Donald Burdick, director of theArmy National Guard. ``Today's Guard is considered a full partnerwith the active component in the Total Force.''   While the Capstone strategy was worked out in the late 1970s, itwas not until the military buildup during the Reagan years that theNational Guard, which once trained with hand-me-down weapons, wasproperly equipped. After the Vietnam War, many of the units weredown to less than 65 percent of their authorized strength.   The Guard now has units with the latest weaponry, such as theAbrams M-1 Tank, the M-2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the RolandAir Defense missile, and most units are at 90 percent or better oftheir authorized strength.   ``The Georgia Guard received the new Abrams tank before theactive component,'' Burdick says. ``Now this sends a hell of asignal to that young man out there in the Guard as to hisimportance today.''   The Air National Guard is also at record strength, with 114,600in 642 units.   The Reserve Forces Policy Board, an advisory group for theDefense Department, says that, among other things, the Air Guard isresponsible for providing air defense on a daily basis for most ofthe continental United States and Puerto Rico. It is solelyresponsible for the air defense of Hawaii.   ``National Guard air defense units provide 78 percent of the airdefense assets for the United States, with two fighter-interceptorson 24-hour alert at each of 22 locations,'' says the board.   Air Guard tankers provided air-to-air refueling for the strikeson Grenada and Libya.   ``We were ready 10 years ago, but it was kind of a paper-thincombat readiness, whereas today the Air Guard is in basically thevery same first-line equipment that the active Air Force is in _F15s, F16s, brand new C-130s,'' says Maj. Gen. John B. Conaway,director of the Air National Guard.   CW3 George Howard Lloyd, an IBM technician from Plant City,Fla., is a radar operator with Florida's 53rd Infantry Brigade, the``Gator Brigade'' that is assigned to defend the Panama Canal. Hefirst joined the Guard 40 years ago at age 16 and saw combat inKorea.   ``Brother, there ain't no comparison between now and what itused to be,'' he says. ``We used to meet once a week and playcards. Now we hit the ground running.''   The National Guard is the only military organization of its kindin the world, with a dual role as a state militia and a federaldefense force.   Frequently called on to assist in emergencies such as naturaldisasters or riots, the Guard has been given more responsibility inhelping curb drug traffic.   The National Guard, which traces its heritage to four militiaregiments organized in the Massachusetts Bay Colony on Dec. 13,1636, has seen duty in every American war since the Pequot IndianWar of 1637. The term ``National Guard'' was first used in Americaby a New York militia unit on Aug. 25, 1824.   Eighteen of the country's 38 presidents, from George Washingtonto Harry S. Truman, were members of the National Guard or themilitias that were the Guard's predecessors.   During World War I, the Guard supplied 17 combat divisions,379,071 soldiers, or about 40 percent of the American ExpeditionaryForces. The records of the German High Command noted that of theeight American divisions considered the best, six were NationalGuard divisions.   In World War II, of the first five U.S. Army divisions to enteroffensive combat, four were National Guard. Among the 300,034Guardsmen who served in the war, 20 received Congressional Medalsof Honor.   In the Korean War, 183,600 Army and Air Guardsmen were called toactive duty.   But of the 3.4 million American servicemen and women sent toSoutheast Asia during the Vietnam War, only 22,745 were Guardsmen.President Lyndon Johnson felt large-scale call-ups of reservistsfor extended periods would lead to more public pressure to ``bringthe boys home.''</TEXT></DOC>
