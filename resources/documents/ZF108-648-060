Johnson, director of BaringSecurities Ltd. of Tokyo.andP;  [But] we're in sort of a year-to-year relativeposition, that the economic cycle is slowing in East Asia.andP;  So compared tolast year we might  see some slowing in the consumer-demand-related parts ofit .andP;  .  [in] products individuals buy, PCs and some of the consumer telecomproducts.andP;  However, in the public demand, there is vast pressure to spendmoney for a wide variety of reasons.andP;  One is seeing enormous infrastructureinvestment, you know, like first-time industrialization [in Southeast Asia].&quot;andM;The vibrancy of the region's growth is, however, closely tied to developmentsin  Japan's economy.andP;  If the tightening of interest rates undertaken by theBank of Japan at press time does not succeed in chokins down further rises inover-inflated property prices and in coaxing the stock market down, Japan'seconomy could sink dramatically.andP;  Such a major colare lapse would ultimatelydrag down the region, since a high percentage of its economic  growth,particularly in Southeast Asia, is predicate on Japanese investment.andM;Potential Political UnrestandM;A political jolt to the region could have the same effect.andP;  Undeniably, theregion has some potentially explosive political wild cards-namely-the oftentense, pending reintegration of the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong,Taiwan's new political regime and its recent student unrest.andP;  But it's highlyunlikely  that anything worse than Tiananmen could happen that would depressthe climate for investment in information technology.andM;Barring such economic or political shocks, the economies and concomitantdemant for information systems should expand, with telecommunications, PCsand laptops leading the way.andP;  Certainly, the stars of growth in the easternside of the Pacific Rim this ear will be in Southeast Asia.andP;  &quot;Singapore is byfar the larger growing area,&quot; says Vangell M. Rafael, director of Software-Vision Consultants of Hong Kong, who has worked many years in Southeast Asiafor IT suppliers such as lessor Econocom International BV, which is based inAmsterdam.andP;  Its is growth, he says, has flattened out in the last two years,&quot;but it's still a bigger marketplace for companies than Hong Kong.andP;  Hong Kongmakes sense to companies to be here for geographic/financial tax reasons, butit's not as large as Singapore and, for example, emerging Malaysia andThailand.&quot;andM;The Market in MalaysiaandM;According to the 1989 annual report from Bank Negara, Malaysia's nationalbank, the Malaysian economy should grow by about 8.3% in 1990, due in largepart to a three-year-old boom in foreign investment.andP;  That boom Was resultedfrom rising costs in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan; appreciating foreigncurrencies; and infrastructural bottlenecks in Thailand.andP;  Barring inflationand unreasonable wage demands, Malaysia could sustain the growth until 1995,says Jaafar Ahmad, a senior economist at the bank.andP;  Private economists havenoted that previous forecasts by the bank have been conservative.andP;  Despite acommunications infrastructure that makes it difficult even to complete aphone call, Thailand's National Economic and Social Development Board expectsthe 1989 economic growth rate to have been higher than its previous estimateof I 0 to 11 %.andP;  The board also revised its 1988 growth figure from 11 to13.2%, the highest in 30 years.andP;  &quot;Thailand has great potential if they canovercome the problems of roads and data communications,&quot; says SoftwareVision's Rafael.andM;Because the local phone system can't cope with the volume of business inThailand, cellular communication systems are growing by leaps and bounds.andO;Baring Securities' Johnson says that even the cellular systems, however, getclogged up due to heavy traffic.andP;  PC use in Thailand is also proliferating.andO;Taiwan-based Acer Inc.'s  distributor, Sahaviriya, reported that its 1989sales soared 50%  to 1 billion baht ($40 million) over 1988's 683 millionbaht ($27.3 million).andM;In producing PCs, Singapore now  makes them more cheaply than Taiwan,according to Takashi Nakatani, general manager for NEC Corp.'s Asia BusinessSystems Division.andP;  Indeed, adds Rafael, &quot;Singapore's interested in developingthe infrastructure to supply the hardware as well as the software.andP;  Thegovernment wants Singapore to be the Silicon Valley of the Far East and isthrowing a lot of money into that.&quot;andM;Since it has few natural resources other than its people, Singapore iscapitalizing on that to take a lead in emerging, technologies.andP;  &quot;Singapore isthe best example of people who are trying to capitalize on what skills they'have.andP;  The Singaporeans are investing in the future.andP;  Hong Kong Chinese arereaping what they can before the future disappears,&quot; Rafael says.andM;Indeed.andP;  The leading Singapore newspaper, The Straits Times, frequentlycarries advertisements for people with expertise in gallium arsenidemanufacturing.andP;  Singapore has had a countrywide electronic data interchange(EDI) system for trade transactions since January 1989, and Singapore Telecomrecently announced an agreement with several foreign telephone companies toimplement the first submarine fiber optic cable to span the Indian Ocean fromSoutheast Asia, through the Middle East, to Europe.andM;Seeing such projects through should not pose a problem, as &quot;there's noshortage of cash in Southeast Asia; they've got the money in the economy,&quot;says Alan Bell, also of Baring Securities.andP;  &quot;I think their political clout issuch that they can attract the right sort of investment.andP;  is Japan's DownturnJust Beginning?andM;Much of such investment will come from Japan, unless the instabilities thatstill exist in the Japanese financial infrastructure-a weakening yen, higherinterest rates, lower growth in corporate profits and an over-inflatedproperty market-create an economic crisis.andP;  It is impossible to predict anupheaval, however.andP;  Some financial authorities, such as Credit Lyonnais, saythe downturn is just beginning.andP;  Other's, such as Daniel Gressel, aneconomist for G.T.andP;  Capital Management in San Francisco, contend that Japan'sstock market declined in accordance with the natural laws of equilibrium.andM;The dire predictions do not account for the fact that the Japanese economyhas successfully weathered worse times, namely the free-fall of the dollarand the oil embargo of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC).andP;  Investment banker Barclays de Zoete Wedd of Tokyo, says the wobblyeconomic factors should not prevent close to a 10% increase in capitalinvestment in fiscal year 1990.andP;  It says Japan's severe labor shortage andgrowing domestic demand should fuel investments such as information systemsthat are designed to increase production capacity.andP;  Barclays expects aboutonefifth of overall Japanese corporate investment in FY90 to go toward suchexpenditures, including is.andP;  Consolidation in many industries in.. Japan,notably finance, is also creating pressure to spend money on technology.andM;The labor shortage, combined with political motivations of the ruling partyto mend its tattered image with better service to its citizens, will ensurethat the government IT market thrives this year.andP;  Bell says computerizationin Japanese governmental organizations is happening, in particular, due to&quot;the inability of government to hire people to do mundane things.&quot; As aresult, he adds, optical disks are bing used by local governments, theMinistry of Finance and the Japan Patent Office to store tax records,corporate records and patents, respectively.andM;The financial industry is a prime example of the consolidation in Japaneseindustry that is driving technology investment.andP;  &quot;Virtually the whole ofJapan is a series of local [financial]  monopolies,&quot; says Baring Securities'Johnson.andP;  &quot;As they deregulate and suddenly have 50 players in the whole arearather than one or two players in each separate area, it becomes more obviousthat nobody has any particular value added over anyone else, which is drivingeveryone to try and create competitive advantage.&quot; To get that advantage,Scott Russell, deputy general manager of the information technologydepartment at Tokyo-based S.G.andP;  Warburg Securities, confirms that  Japanesebanks are pouring incredible amounts of money into technology.&quot;andM;Yuji Ogino, president of IDC Japan Ltd., expects overall IT purchases inJapan to grow about 12% in 1990, with hardware-only revenues up 13% andsoftware-only revenues up 15%.andP;  Systems integration revenues will be thestar, he says, growing at more than 30%, which should result in a VI.2trillion market by 1992.andP;  Of total IT expenditures, office automation systemsand telecommunications figure most prominently.andP;  An annual forecast of thecountry's leading goods and services by the daily Keizai Shinbun projectsthat PCs will be second only to credit cards in 1990, growing at 12%.andO;Optical fiber rates fourth or fifth, with a growth rate of 7%.andM;&quot;In Japan you've got people carrying notebooks [computsays  BaringSecurities' Johnson.andP;  &quot;Communications in Japan is becoming multidimensionaland omnipresent, and though it's not bottle-necked necessarily, it's verystretched.andP;  &quot;andM;The projected rate of growth in fiber optics is thus no surprise, as NipponTelegraph and Telephone Corp. has targeted 40% of its domestic switchingsystems to be digitized this year.andP;  A trans-Pacific fiber optic cable is alsoon schedule.andM;While not plagued by a labor shortage as Japan is, South Korea an Taiwan haveseen their labor costs and currency valuations skyrocket in the last fewyears.andP;  Over the last three years, real labor costs in South Korea have goneup around 200%.andP;  Between September 1986 and December 1989, the cost of laborin Taiwan rose approximately 150%, and the new Taiwan dollar (NTD)appreciated about 45%.andP;  Although South Korea's export-driven economy has beenslumping since last year, neither country's economy seems threatened withdisaster.andM;South Korea's market for iT is, for instance, still second only to Japan's.andO;Tony Tsang, a general manager for Wang Pacific Ltd., says: &quot;Three years ago,we [at Wang] ought out our Korean distributor because the market was justgetting too big for a distributor to handle.andP;  South Korea is becoming thesecond-largest market-$1.5 billion in 1989 and well on its way to $2billion.&quot;andM;Says Sung  Kyou Park, president of Daewoo Telecom Co. Ltd. of Scoul, &quot;We maynot see very high-paced growth, but the economy will grow, and of course[there are] some problems to solve.andP;  Traditionally, people looked upon thispart of the world as the area where the economy was growing due toinexpensive labor.andP;  But the labor cost in this part of the world  has gone upvery, very fast, especially in South Korea.andM;&quot;In order to absorb that kind of expensive labor cost, we have to go throughmany structural changes,&quot; Park says.andP;  &quot;We have to develop different types ofproducts that have more value added so we can be competitive in the worldmarket.&quot;andM;No doubt due in part tot the uncertanity surrounding such change, SouthKorea's stock index has fallen by about 10% so far this year and has stood atits lowest level since the start of last year.andP;  But most analysts expectSouth Korea's growth to accelerate in the second half of the year.andM;Taiwan's economy is in much the same position as South Korea's, save for alower concentration of heavy industry.andP;  IT already figures prominently in thecontinued growth of the domestic economy, which is also being forced by highlabor costs to shift to more value-added products, such as software, that aresold under brand names, not via original equipment manufacturer (OEM)channels.andP;  The Taipei-based Institute for Information Industry (III) says itsIT industry, including software, should reach$7.5 billion in 1990.andP;  &quot;Eventhough Taiwan is very important to the world information industry, there isnot much brand name recognition.andP;  We have to promote brand namesaggressively.andP;  Also, to compete with Korean companies, we have to create[more] value-added products,&quot; says Max Wu, vice president of market promotionfor Acer.andM;Developing markets for those products is a top priority  for  both countries.andO;Daewoo has set up a European marketing network.andP;  The Soviet Union and EasternEurope also represent important potential business for Korean and other EastAsian IT suppliers.andP;  East Asian suppliers finalizing deals for supply orassembly of PCs in those regions include South Korea's Lucky Goldstar,Singapore's Wearnes Technology and Malaysia's Accent Technology SB (ATSB).andO;Paul Liu, president of Taiwanese laptop maker Aquarius Systems, says 20% ofits anticipated 1990 sales of $30  Million will  be to Eastern Europe.andP;  Acerseems to have successfully globalized its operations.andP;  One of the top threesuppliers in over 15 countries, Acer says it is No.andP;  I in Bahrain, Bolivia,Chile, Cyprus, jordan, Taiwan and Thailand.andM;OEM, not brand name, business continues to be Taiwan's bread and butter,despite the increases in labor costs.andP;  &quot;Everyone said that after the Taiwandollar was appreciated 45% and the labor costs here went un 150%, the buyerswould start going to mainland China, Indonesia and all that.andP;  Well, some did,but instability and unreliable supplies just drew all the buyers right backto Taiwan.andP;  Overall, Taiwan's exports have continued to grow at 20 to 30%,&quot;says David Lightle, consultant to the Brand International PromotionAssociation (BIPA) in Taipei.andM;The Taiwanese software industry is, however, not yet mature enough to startexporting its product; Ill says the industry will have to wait until thecopyright law changes before it can export.andP;  In the meantime, says BIPA'sLightle, &quot;Taiwan has been contracted to do a lot of [OEM] softwaredevelopment for IBM.andP;  That's a major, major project, hundreds of millions ofdollars for IBM Taiwan.&quot;andM;Whether its IT industry continues to be OEM or becomes predominantly brandname, one of Taiwan's greatest strengths is its engineering and sheer brainpower, says jackson Lin, general manager of Wang Industrial Co. Ltd. inTaipei.andP;  Furthermore, says Lightle, the historical drain on that resource isreversing.andP;  &quot;Salaries are up into the $50,000-a-year range for top flightengineers, so more are saying,andM;Why should I think about getting a better life in San Francisco when I cancome back home?' And companies like Acer are snapping them up,&quot; he says.andO;&quot;Brain drain is not a problem for Taiwan anymore; they're getting enough backnow to support the boom in high tech.andP;  It's Hong Kong that is losingeverybody.&quot;andM;Hong Kong's Growth is SlowingandM;An emigration of talented is pros from the Fragrant Harbor has been one dearprice Hong Kong has paid for Britain's decision to give it back to China in1997.andP;  Its economy also has suffered from the events of last june in Beijng.andO;Before Tiananmen, Hong Kong's trade with  China was growing at an annual rateof 35%; it fell to 3% for the third quarter of 1989.andP;  Analysts expect HongKong's gross domestic product growth rate to slow to around 2.5% this year,in large part because the regime in Beijing slammed on the brakes ofpolitical and economic reform.andP;  Growth should not drop below that, asgovernment projects already under way and the commitment of long-time HongKong corporations to stay should keep the demand for information systemsstrong.andM;A 1989 member survey by the Hong Kong Computer Society found that over 40% ofthe top IS professionals intended to leave the territory within the next 18months for Canada or Australia or the United States.andP;  &quot;What's happening isyou're having middle management, the 30- to 35-year-old experienced guys,migrating to Canada, Australia, switching of their passports,&quot; says GrahamGlover, area head &quot;the information systems division for Standard CharteredBank.andP;  &quot;They're the ones that really hurt when they go because these are theguys that you're reliant upon, who understand how the organization works.&quot;andO;Surprisingly, Standard Chartered had less staff turnover in 1989 than in1988, with about 30% turnover in 1988 and 15% last year.andM;Says Software Vision's Rafael, &quot;Clearly, that has an effect on theinformation technology industry.andP;  The dependence that companies had before onin-house expertise doesn't exist.andP;  There is no in-house expertise.&quot; As aresult, IT suppliers will have to provide systems expertise for thegovernment's infrastructure projects, namely the  HK$127 billion new Chek LapKok Airport and a new port.andP;  The government may also choose to implement anEDI system for trading, called Tradelink, by 1991.andM;&quot;The Hong Kong government has been sharply increasing its IT spending,upgrading the DP agency to a full department status,&quot; says Wang's Tsang.andO;&quot;The increase in its staff is close to a tripling since the current directortook over.andP;  Various things have led to it: partly 1997; next year will beanother 10-year census; and also the first large scale, direct election ofthe city council.andP;  The labor problem [shortage] has created a keener sense ofautomating.andP;  &quot;andM;Some corporations, such as Standard Charter, are following the government'slead.andP;  &quot;We, in IT terms, are putting most of our efforts into Hong Kong.andP;  Notall projects have been developed in Hong Kong, but by far the majority ofthem,&quot; Glover says.andP;  Veterans like A.F.M.andP;  &quot;Con&quot; Conway, director, majoraccounts group, at Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd., who has been in theHong KongandM;IT industry for nearly 30 years, see no reason fir, concern.andP;  &quot;In Hong Kong,we're a very large user of information technology ...andP;  [and] it will continueto increase-I would see a 10% compound-provided we get the various issuescorrect.&quot;andM;One of those issues, he says, is getting the regulations of the CoordinatingCommittee Tor Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) changed to accommodateHong Kong in 1997.andP;  &quot;The situation arises that on Tuesday, the 1st of  July,1997, we're technically part of China and not part of Britain.andP;  Therefore,all goods being shipped into Hone Kong will be shipped as if they wereshipped to China.andP;  The vast majority of goods on that fist would not get alicense for China&quot;, [but] all of these products could come into Hong Kongwithout a matter of hindrance at the moment,&quot; Conway says.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
