John Elliott, chairman of the Australian brewing, agribusiness, resources and financial-services company, said terms of the transaction will be announced within two or three months. Elders will probably announce new acquisitions at about the same time, he added. &quot;We have the financial capacity to buy any brewer in the world right now,&quot; he said, adding that acquisitions are also being considered in agribusiness and financial services.    The company acquired the pubs when it bought the Courage Ltd. brewery business in 1986. Today, debt-free and with 582 million Australian dollars ($424 million) in convertible bonds outstanding, it is in a strong position to expand, analysts say. </TEXT></DOC>
