An invigorated Simon, encouraged by an outpouring of cash andsupport, changed his mind about needing a win in Minnesota or SouthDakota next Tuesday to stay in the race.   ``Candidly, I was at first frustrated by the razor thin marginsthat separated me from victory in Iowa and New Hampshire,'' theIllinois senator said in Minneapolis. ``I was tempted to bow to theconvention wisdom ... This is a marathon race for the heart andsoul of the Democratic Party, and I'm in it until the finish linein Atlanta.''   In Florida, Dole denied he and fellow Republican Pat Robertsoncoordinated their decision to skip tonight's Dallas debate, leavingonly George Bush and Jack Kemp to share the stage with two emptychairs.   Dole said his campaign received only 60 of the 2,600 ticketsavailable, leading him to the conclusion that the forum in the vicepresident's one-time home state would be ``a Bush pep rally.''   Debate organizers said the campaigns were all allotted the samenumber of tickets, and criticized Dole, saying he had lobbiedRobertson to stay away too.   Southerner Albert Gore Jr., who was mainly on the sidelines inearly campaign contests, came out swinging as Democrats sparred attheir leadoff debate of Super Tuesday season on Thursday night.   In Nevada, Bush won a non-binding GOP presidential straw pollThursday night. But his tally was nearly equaled by undecided votes_ many of which were believed to have been cast by supporters ofRobertson in a bid to control later balloting. Robertson also got alarge chunk of votes outright.   The presidential candidate ranks thinned by two on Thursday asBruce Babbitt and Republican Pete du Pont made their exits. Neitherexpressed regret about his underdog candidacy.   Babbitt called his quest for the nomination ``the greatest joyof my entire public life'' and du Pont declared: ``Our campaignlowers its flag, but our crusade continues to march.''   That marked a trio of withdrawals from the White House race in aweek _ Republican Alexander Haig, the former secretary of state,bowed out last Friday in New Hampshire.   At the Dallas debate Thursday night, Gore quickly took theoffensive, asking Michael Dukakis why he was willing to tolerate aSoviet client state in Central America.   ``I never said that, Al,'' snapped Dukakis, who racked up a bigwin in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.   Gore also scrapped with Rep. Richard Gephardt, the Democraticwinner in Iowa, taking the Missouri congressman to task for shiftson issues.   That got a rise out of Gephardt, who retorted: ``Maybe you oughtto start looking at your own record first,'' and went on to claimthat Gore has moved to the right on military issues since enteringthe race.   ``Lately you've been sounding more like Al Haig than Al Gore,''Gephardt said sharply.   ``That line sounds more like Richard Nixon than RichardGephardt,'' Gore fired back.   Gary Hart, mired at the back of the Democratic pack, got in afew digs, saying if Gephardt's trade bill ever took effect it wouldbe ``a catastrophe.''   And Jesse Jackson, who has a big Southern following, drewapplause when he criticized wasteful military spending.   Gore, who bypassed the Iowa caucuses and ran only a limitedcampaign in New Hampshire, is staking his hopes on a Southernstrategy. The setting of the debate _ in the biggest Super Tuesdaystate _ underscored the Tennessee senator's urgent need for astrong showing in the region.   At one point, Gephardt jabbed Gore for playing down the earlycontests.   ``I don't think people vote for political strategies,'' he said.   The Democrats had another confrontation scheduled tonight, thisone in St. Paul, Minn.   The debate debate wasn't the only contention within Republicanranks.   Bush, campaigning in Missouri, insisted ``I'm telling thetruth'' about Dole. The Kansas senator has been complaining about11th-hour ads Bush ran in New Hampshire, attacking Dole's stand ontaxes, oil import fees and arms control.   Dole, in North Carolina, made it clear the commercials werestill a sore point.   ``I wanted to get here before the TV ads,'' the Kansas senatorsaid in Charlotte. ``Before you see some TV ad saying Bob Dole willraise your taxes, say you've heard it from the candidate himself.... We don't need any more tax increases.''   Kemp, campaigning in South Carolina, was asked about hisprospects in the state. ``We expect to be very competitive,'' theNew York congressman said. ``We're going all the way to NewOrleans,'' site of the GOP national convention.</TEXT></DOC>
