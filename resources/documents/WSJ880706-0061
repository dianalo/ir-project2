Mulheren Jr., the arbitrager arrested for allegedly threatening the life of former takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky, agreed to extend the government's deadline for obtaining an indictment until July 26, according to people familiar with the case.    Thomas Puccio, Mr. Mulheren's attorney, confirmed the extension but declined further comment.    Without the extension, the government would have been required to obtain an indictment by yesterday or drop the charges. If the government obtains an indictment, Mr. Mulheren is expected to be charged with interference with a witness in a federal case and weapons and securities law violations.    The government has been investigating whether Mr. Mulheren took stock positions for Mr. Boesky to conceal the true ownership of the securities. Government prosecutors would prefer to delay Mr. Mulheren's case to avoid exposing Mr. Boesky -- their star witness in many cases besides that of Mr. Mulheren -- to premature cross-examination, according to people familiar with the case.    A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office declined comment. </TEXT></DOC>
