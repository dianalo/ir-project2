CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A modern parallel is unfolding of the ancientPassover story of liberation _ the rising exodus of Jews permittedby the Soviet Union.   The resemblances were cited as the week-long Passover observancestarted Wednesday evening, marking the Jewish flight from bondagein Egupt.   However, Jews today don't have to rely on rituals of the past,says Theodore Ellenoff, president of the American Jewish Committee.``Before our very eyes, the gates of the Soviet Union have beenthrown open, and Jews are using the opportunity to stream out.''   During the first three months of this year, 9,461 Jews have beenallowed to emigrate from the Soviet, triple the number in the sameperiod last year, with projections the 1989 total may reach 40,000.   That would be the third year of a steadily rising surge ofdepartures under the more open policies of Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev.   Shoshana Cardin, chairman of the National Conference on SovietJewry, applauds the increased emigrations and improvements inreligious and cultural rights of Soviet Jews, but adds: ``Ourpriority this Passover remains our often voiced demand, `Let ourpeople go.'   ``We will not be silent until every Jew who wishes to emigrateis free to do so, until every Jew who wishes to remain in theSoviet Union is allowed full cultural and religious rights.''   The demand, ``Let my people go,'' originally was flung by theancient Jewish leader Moses at the Egyptian Pharaoh in the world'searliest struggle for religious freedom nearly 4,000 years ago.   ``Those words still are relevant,'' says Gerald Strober,information officer of the NCSJ. ``Pharaoh has begun to loosen upand we welcome it. But we must remain ever vigilant.''   Moderating conditions for Soviet Jews, however, were seen assimilar to the Jewish deliverance from oppression in Egypt, thePassover event which has become a universal symbol of humanliberation.   As in the case of the ancient Israelites, the troubles weren'tover for Soviet Jews after being let out of the country.   About 7,000 of them are stranded at a center near Rome, most ofthem wanting to come to the United States, but exceeding U.S.quotas or refused U.S. refugee status as fleeing persecution.   Israel accepts all wishing to go there, but the logjam haspersisted, with efforts being made in this country to modify therestrictions.   In the light of the ancient liberation from Egypt, Ellenoffsaid, ``It is no surprise that the new mass emigration of SovietJewry has raised new perplexities.   ``Our Bible teaches that physical emancipation is just thebeginning of a long, painstaking redemptive process. We read thatthe freed Israelites complained bitterly to Moses about thehardships of freedom.   ``When they had been slaves, the masters had taken care of theirbasic needs in return for obedient subservience. Only now, withemancipation, did the Israelites have to worry about food, waterand protection from armed attack.''   While more Jews are being allowed to leave the Soviet Union, thesituation for those still there has moderated. Added facilities arebeing provided, and the NCSJ says all 15 Jewish prisoners ofconcience have been released.   Manhattan's Park Avenue synagogue for the second successive yearairlifed Passover supplies to Soviet Jewish congregations in Moscowand Odessa _ two tons of matzoth, wine, gefilte fish and otherkosher foods for Passover.   Rabbi Arthur Schneier, leader of the Manhattan congregation andhead of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, recently negotiatedthe return to Moscow's Choral Synagogue of an adjoining buildingfor a community center.   He said the center, when refurbished through funding by theManhattan synagogue, would provide a lecture hall, meeting roomsand classrooms for Jewish adult education, courses in Bible, Jewishhistory and Hebrew and a kosher restaurant.   Soviet Jews are celebrating Passover with a new haggadah _recounting God's deliverances _ in Russian and Hebrew, published byMoscow's Choral Synagogue with help of the U.S. Memorial Foundationfor Jewish Culture.   The Soviet's Jewish population has been estimated at about 2million, and how many want to leave is uncertain. The NCSJ saysthat several years ago it estimated the figure at more than300,000, but it now may be less.   Questions remain about various aspects of the situation,Ellenoff says, and the answers may not come quickly. ``After all,''he adds, ``it took 40 years for the emancipated Israelites to reachthe promised land.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PM April 21.</NOTE></DOC>
