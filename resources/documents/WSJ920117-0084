The 1991 loss of $9.88 a share is the largest in thecompany's 98-year history, both on a net and operating basis.It includes a fourth-quarter charge of $165.1 million towrite down assets and cut about 3,500 of the 14,200 jobs atits Inland Steel Co. unit. Inland, the nation'sfourth-largest steelmaker, said about 40% of the chargeinvolves a noncash write-down of cokemaking facilities, afoundry and two blast furnaces. The remaining cash chargesrelate to job cuts, which would be accomplished in the nextseveral years.</LP><TEXT>   In 1990, Inland had a loss of $20.6 million, or $1.41 ashare. Sales fell 12% to $3.4 billion from $3.87 billion in1990.   Frank W. Luerssen, chairman, said, &quot;1991 was a year ofmany negatives, which we are glad to have behind us.&quot; Henoted that prices were low and shipments to the consumerdurables markets fell sharply as a result of the recession;meanwhile, costs, especially labor-related, were high.   The near-term outlook isn't much better. &quot;We have noillusions that the months ahead are going to be anything butdifficult,&quot; said Mr. Luerssen. &quot;The outlook for steel orders,particularly from the automobile industry, remains weak.&quot;Still, he said, the cost-cutting moves should accelerate thereturn to profitability.   In the fourth quarter, the company had a loss of $191.3million, or $6.44 a share, including the charge. In the 1990quarter, when several of the company's operations were shutdown, Inland had a loss of $57.1 million, or $2.05 a share.Excluding the 1991 write-down, the company had a loss of$26.2 million, or $1.11 a share, in the quarter.   The loss was slightly higher than analysts estimates ofabout $1 a share, excluding write-downs. The company reportedthe losses after the market closed. In late New York StockExchange trading yesterday, Inland shares rose $2.375 to$25.125.   Inland has been haunted throughout 1991 by high costs,including those related to the start-up of its $1.1 billionNippon Steel Corp. joint venture in rolling and coatingfacilities. While those costs may continue into 1992,analysts generally feel Inland could turn around by focusingon higher-value products and niche markets.   Moreover, they note that a new management team is inplace, including two top officials from outside the steelindustry. Inland's new chief financial officer, Earl Mason,was formerly with Digital Equipment Corp., while thepresident of the company's $1.8 billion flat-rolled-productbusiness is Sandy Nelson Jr., formerly with Aluminum Co. ofAmerica.</TEXT></DOC>
