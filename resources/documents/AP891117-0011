Department and labor union analysts said the reported jump ininjuries and illnesses from 6 million in 1987 to 6.4 million lastyear can be at least partly attributed to improved reporting byemployers.   About 3,300 workplace deaths were reported by the department'sBureau of Labor Statistics, which said it considered that number tobe very conservative because of the limited scope of its fatalitydata.   Margaret Seminario, the AFL-CIO's associate safety director,said Thursday that improved reporting stems from more aggressiveenforcement of reporting requirements by the Labor Department'sOccupational Safety and Health Administration.   ``OSHA's heavy hand has employers more thoroughly reportingdata,'' Seminario said.   Still, she said that even considering the impact of improvedreporting, the data still indicated that safety problems inAmerican workplaces were getting worse.   The Labor Department said the reported increases last yearbrought the rate of injuries and illnesses to 8.6 for every 100full-time workers, up from 8.3 in 1987. The number of incidentsthat resulted in lost work days rose to four for every 100 workersin 1988, up from 3.8 in 1987.   The number of reported injuries and illnesses was up in everysector of the economy, with more than 200,000 of the increasecoming in manufacturing, which reported 2.46 million on-the-jobinjuries and illnesses last year.   The highest incidence of injuries came in automobilemanufacturing, where 19.5 injuries were reported for every 100full-time workers last year.   Of 240,000 illnesses reported by employers for 1988, 115,400 _48 percent _ were associated with repeated trauma, the department'sterm for illnesses blamed on repetitive motion.   The number of reported cases in that category was up 58 percent,a factor interpreted by analysts as evidence that repetitive motionproblems are being more clearly identified in manufacturing,meatpacking, construction and other sectors of the economy wherethey are most common.</TEXT></DOC>
