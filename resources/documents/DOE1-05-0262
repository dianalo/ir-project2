The studyconcludes clearly that: future energy supplies will not be as plentifulas is currently believed. For example, it appears that by 2005 at thelatest, and perhaps as early as 1995, on average it will take more energyto explore for new U.S. oil and gas than the wells will produce. Naturallyone will continue to pump old oil fields after 2005 - but not long after;U.S. oil will be virtually exhausted by 2020; neither the supply of alternativefuels nor the nation's energy efficiency can be increased quickly enoughto completely offset the effect of declining supplies of oil and gas,which now account for almost 70 percent of U.S. fuel use; A long-termdownturn in U.S. gross national product is likely soon, probably startingin the 1990s; and because U.S. agriculture is heavily oil-dependent,it is vulnerable - so vulnerable that we could lose our ability to bea net exporter of food within the next twenty to thirty-five years, unlessagricultural energy efficiency is raised dramatically.</TEXT></DOC>
