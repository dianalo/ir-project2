The main characteristicsof these developments include the rise in oil prices, with consequentgovernment incentives to implement energy efficiency, and a subsequentdrop in energy demand as part of the inflation of energy costs. The outlookfor Canada's renewable energy sector is affected by the slow growth ofthe Canadian economy and large government deficits which restrict stimulationof the economy by state intervention. Energy prices face downward pressurefollowing the accumulation of supply surpluses; however, a number ofother factors are tending to keep energy prices sufficiently high soas to provide an incentive for residential and industrial energy conservation.The implications of these points for the conservation/renewable energyindustry are discussed. One is that since energy conservation does notappear to be as high a public priority as it has been in the past, theindustry will have to overcome this decline in interest. Canadians willhave to be made aware that the energy supply problem has not gone away,and the industry must remember that much of Canada's conservation/renewableenergy potential remains unexploited. Public policy makers can help inthis by implementing coherent, market-sensitive energy pricing policiesand by providing improved public information on conservation/energy substitutionopportunities.</TEXT></DOC>
