Hutton andamp; Co. agreed to refund $650,000 to Massachusetts investors who bought or sold unregistered securities through the brokerage firm, the Massachusetts secretary of state said.    Hutton also agreed to install a computerized system to allow its brokers to verify the registration of securities and to allow a Boston lawyer appointed by the state to monitor the system.    The securities involved were Cadillac Exploration Ltd., Arizona Silver Corp., Continental Silver Corp., Terra Mines Ltd. and Technograph Inc.    As previously reported, the secretary of state's securities division also alleged earlier this year that Hutton brokers misrepresented certain information about Cadillac.    Hutton agreed to the settlement, but didn't admit any of the state's allegations. It also agreed to pay $20,000 to reimburse the state for the cost of the investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
