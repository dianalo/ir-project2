About a dozen years ago, many decided to become full-time residents.    Greenwich has water, meadows and bird-lovers who are generous with their gourmet bread crumbs. But plagued by goose droppings on its beach, the town finally brought out its biggest gun: a yacht-club cannon. The booms from blanks failed to budge the birds from some of America's choicest real estate.    &quot;We have passed a law against feeding the birds now, but who's going to arrest someone for feeding a goose?&quot; says Greenwich's equivalent of a mayor, First Selectman John B. Margenot Jr.    As America's corporate elite sees it, the birds know a good thing. Of all the suburbs where top executives have flocked since World War II, none has attracted so many as this town of 60,000, a 51-minute train ride from midtown Manhattan.    &quot;In terms of the number of chief executive officers of major companies who live there, no other place comes close,&quot; says Thomas J. Neff, president of the executive recruiters Spencer Stuart andamp; Associates and himself a Greenwich resident. The town today can claim -- besides such celebrities as David Stockman and Diana Ross -- current or recent chief executives of Exxon Corp., Citicorp, General Electric Co., American Express Co., PepsiCo Inc., GTE Corp., Union Pacific Corp., Combustion Engineering Inc. and others.    Greenwich is no idyllic retreat, no haven from sprawl, congestion, unhappiness, crime or drugs. Neither is it Middletown, U.S.A. In large parts of Greenwich, the minimum lot size is four acres. The median price of single-family houses sold there last year was $480,000.    The local high school -- whose principal is called a headmaster -- has been ranked among the nation's best. It periodically sends its girls' lacrosse team to play in England. Yet 36% of Greenwich's high school seniors say they get drunk or high on alcohol once a week a more.    On the surface, big white neo-Colonial houses on vast lawns make this town look as if it might never change. But Greenwich, like other executive towns, is changing.    For one thing, the affluent have become more so. Membership in a single country club was once a luxury. Now, many residents belong to two or even three.    &quot;The yacht club near us is only open in summer, so we belong to another one for winter entertainment,&quot; says the wife of a recently retired New York mining executive. In Vermont, where they summer, the couple belong to yet another club.    Life in the clubs is changing, too. Reflecting today's exercise craze, strenuous sports such as tennis and squash are gaining ground fast, says John Moreland, general manager of the Greenwich Country Club. Interest in gourmet dining is rising. When the club recently scheduled a $200-a-couple dinner, it had to draw up a waiting list. &quot;Ten years ago, this wouldn't have gone over,&quot; Mr. Moreland says.    Greenwich homeowners have plenty of assets, on paper at least, to cover their bills for pheasant terrine. Soaring real estate values have seen to that. Last year, one in seven houses sold there fetched more than $1 million, and one went for more than $11 million. A service station owner says he recently sold his house there for $500,000 to build a better one.    Simple clapboard houses on ordinary city lots can still be found -- at $250,000. More Greenwichers than in the past have bought one or more &quot;second homes&quot; in New England, Florida, the Caribbean or New York City. &quot;The person who used to have two houses now has four,&quot; says Carl W. Menk, chairman of Canny, Bowen Inc., executive recruiters in New York.    The standard of living for children seems to have risen even more. Instead of parking the kids with Grandma, parents take them to Europe; Mr. Neff's two sons are traveling with him to the Bahamas this spring and to England this summer.    About half the students at Greenwich High own or have access to a home computer, says David Quattrone, headmaster.    Girls' lacrosse isn't the only vehicle for foreign adventure. The school's idea of a Western Civilization class trip is a yearly pilgrimage to France, Italy or Greece, and about a third of the class goes. Of 700 seniors, 500 have parking permits, according to Mr. Quattrone. But, he adds, &quot;only a few&quot; have Mercedes-Benzes or BMWs.    &quot;Kids here can grow up with an unbalanced view of what the world is like,&quot; says Stephen Brecher, partner in the accounting firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell andamp; Co. in New York. But like many parents there, he says the quality of the school system was a &quot;key reason&quot; he moved to Greenwich.    In fact, executive suburbs such as Greenwich seem to be holding their coveted position in U.S. education. A few years ago, a survey of college admissions officers and high school principals ranked the high school there in the nation's top 12.    About a quarter of the students qualify for advanced college placement in at least one subject. Around 200 of the high school students a year take calculus, commonly a college-level course, Mr. Quattrone says. Teachers earn as much as $45,000 a year, and their classes average only 20 students each.    But about a quarter of the town's students attend private schools. At the Brunswick School, a boys' day school, mandatory Latin starts in the seventh grade. Many students take calculus there, too.    Students are concerned with doing well. But many suffer from &quot;fear that they won't be able to match their parents' achievements,&quot; says Norman A. Pedersen, headmaster of Brunswick.    &quot;The parents don't have to say a word,&quot; he says. &quot;It's in the culture.&quot; The pressure to perform contributes to teenage drinking and drug-taking, some Greenwichers say. Others point to busy parents' frequent absences for business or pleasure.    &quot;The party scene revolves around houses where parents are absent for the weekend,&quot; Mr. Quattrone says.    Whatever the causes, the problems worry Greenwich. In a poll of 4,355 youngsters three years ago, 15% of the high school seniors -- and 4% of the seventh graders -- said they used marijuana at least once a week. Moreover, 57% of seniors and 12% of eighth-graders said they drank at least once a week. Five percent of the town's eighth-graders said they were getting drunk or high on liquor at least once a week.    One parent recalls a high school student so drunk he passed out in class -- at 10 a.m. In a thriving volunteer program called Safe Rides, teen-agers give rides to other youngsters too drunk to drive.    &quot;You just can't overestimate the problem,&quot; says the Rev. John W. Bishop, rector of Christ Episcopal Church. But the youngsters aren't alone in their problem. An Alcoholics Anonymous group that meets at the church Friday evenings is so packed &quot;you can't find a parking place,&quot; Father Bishop says.    In at least one important way, the pressure on adults is easing significantly in towns such as Greenwich. As more companies move to the suburbs, hundreds of executives are putting the train ride to the city behind them.    &quot;Ten years ago, the bulk of people who commuted went to New York,&quot; says Mr. Moreland, the country club manager. &quot;Now, more than half commute to towns in the area.&quot;    Life also is changing in other ways. Even among women in their 50s who are married to senior executives, about a quarter now hold jobs, Father Bishop estimates. And of Greenwich women in their 30s and 40s married to executives, probably 60% to 70% have jobs, he says.    &quot;After people ask you what you are up to 750 times, you think, 'Now I have to be up to something,'&quot; says Cecie Munkenbeck, wife of a corporate executive who started a landscape design career in her late 50s.    The environmental movement is thriving. If there is one thing that America's premier corporate bedroom doesn't want, it seems to be more business. In recent years, several companies, such as Chesebrough-Pond's Inc., have moved their headquarters to Greenwich or nearby towns. To try to hold down congestion, Greenwich imposed two moratoriums on office building in the past decade; and after each one was lifted, restrictions were tightened.    &quot;My biggest source of complaints is expansion of office buildings,&quot; Mr. Margenot, the first selectman, says. Now, Greenwich is fighting the proposed expansion of a corporate headquarters just across the city line in Stamford. Workers driving to the office crowd a Greenwich street, residents say. Some even propose making the street one-way: away from the office in the morning, toward it in the afternoon.    In the long run, another change now taking place may become the most significant one: The people of Greenwich are becoming more diverse.    As in some other suburbs favored by corporate elites, many residents years ago resisted selling their homes to Jews. Even today, many country clubs have few Jewish members.    But Greenwich's Jewish population has grown to between 4,000 and 5,000 -- triple the figure of 20 years ago, says Rabbi Hillel Silverman, leader of a Jewish congregation there. He says Jews no longer encounter problems buying homes in Greenwich.    At Greenwich High School, minority-group enrollment, about equally divided among black, Hispanic and Asian students, has climbed to 10% of the student body from 6.5% in 1980, Mr. Quattrone says. The minorities' representation in the total town population is smaller but still significant.    Many descendants of black servants live in modest Greenwich frame houses, and a few more middle-class blacks are moving in. But as real estate prices rise, black and white residents are coming to share a fear that their children won't live as adults in the kind of town they knew as children.    Nancy C. Brown, a black town official whose husband's family has lived there for three generations, says her son &quot;would love to live in Greenwich.&quot; The son, a computer graphics artist, has bought a house in nearby -- but less expensive -- Stamford.    &quot;There's no question about it,&quot; she says, &quot;people have a real fear of being squeezed out.&quot;    ---   Mr. Ricklefs, based in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau, is a national correspondent.    ---                     Greenwich: A Profile    Distance from Wall Street                   38 miles    Founded                                     1640    Size                                        50.6 square                                                miles    Population                                  60,000    Median age                                  39.6 years    Median household income                     $55,000    Median cost of single family house          $480,000    Percentage of single family homes    for sale for over $1 million                25%    Commuters out of town daily                 18,000    Commuters into town daily                   27,000    Public education spending per pupil         $4,836    Average public school class size            20 students    Percentage of public school grads    who go to 4-year college                    69%    Top teachers' salary                        $45,000    Number of public schools                    13    Number of private schools                   9    Unemployment rate                           1.8%    Number of restaurants                       75    Number of country clubs                     10    Number of churches                          41   Sources: Greenwich Public Schools, Town of Greenwich,Greenwich Chamber of Commerce, Greenwich Board of Realtors</TEXT></DOC>
