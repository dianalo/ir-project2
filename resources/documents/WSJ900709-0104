Soviet and East German officials rushed to the scene,but they offered no explanation of why the rocket had landedin her back yard instead of on the nearby target range. &quot;Thatwasn't the sort of thing you asked about back then,&quot; shesays.</LP><TEXT>   But those days are over.   When a Soviet warplane accidentally dumped three bombs onanother nearby village last month, local citizens launched apetition and penned a testy letter to Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev.   While this might seem a normal response anywhere else,it's remarkable in East Germany, where for decades no onedared criticize the Soviets. Now, however, the Soviets areunder mounting pressure to get their 380,000 troops out ofEast Germany. In villages where daily life is often disruptedby a Soviet air base and target range, the sentiment is thatthe sooner they're gone the better.   Indeed, finding a way to ease the Soviets out withoutalienating them threatens to slow German unification.   The West, eager to keep a united Germany in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization, is packaging concessions aimedat smoothing the way for a graceful Soviet exit. The deal maybring drastic cuts of the united Germany's armed forces,perhaps down to 200,000 men, from the combined total ofalmost 600,000 now.   But East German officials, who met with their Warsaw Pactallies this month, say the Soviets are planning to stay forat least seven more years.   Many East Germans may not be willing to wait that long.Just days after last month's accidental bombing, protestersmarched to Neuruppin's sprawling air base. About 100 EastGermans from the crowd of 6,000 scrambled over a coil ofbarbed wire and rushed onto the airport's runway, turningback only after confronting armed Soviet soldiers.   Even if East Germans are willing to tolerate a longtransition, last week's introduction of the West German markinto East Germany shatters an economic system that supportedthe Soviet presence.   Soviet officers were active in East Germany's thrivingblack market, swapping such commodities as gasoline for Eastand West German currency, which they used to buy goodsdifficult to obtain at home. They also operated an extensivegray market for labor, sending their wives and evenconscripts to work in East German factories.   Neuruppin's large meat packing plant, for instance, has 20Soviet women among its staff of 250. &quot;It happenedeverywhere,&quot; says Reiner Frank, who was Neuruppin's mayor forthe past two years.   Much of this activity will come to a grinding halt afterEast Germany converts to a market economy. As of last week,the Soviets were paid in West German marks.   On the official level, East Germany is hardly a hotbed ofanti-Soviet sentiment. But in everyday life, East Germanssneeringly refer to their Soviet &quot;guests&quot; as &quot;Ivan.&quot; Thesefeelings are especially strong in towns and villages close tomilitary installations.   Neuruppin's air base, for instance, is nestled close tothe town's central business district. Planes taking off andlanding create a racket that begins at 6 a.m. and often goeson until midnight.   Citizens have quietly lobbied against the base for twoyears, writing letters that disappeared into the vast Sovietmilitary bureaucracy. Only since November have they becomebold enough to stage public rallies. The one last monthfeatured placards reading: &quot;Ivan, aren't you homesick?&quot;   Unlike bases in West Germany, where community relationsare considered routine, the Soviets don't have anyone toformally hear East German complaints.   &quot;I telephoned the Soviet commander every night for fiveweeks before I finally got through to somebody to complain,&quot;says Norbert Arndt, the gardener in Neuruppin's cemetery,which lies right under the airport's flight path.   Leading a visitor down a dusty path between rows ofheadstones, Mr. Arndt points to the graveyard where all treeswere removed 20 years ago so that planes could fly evenlower. &quot;Most days,&quot; he says, &quot;you can smell the burning jetfuel -- a really nice touch for a funeral.&quot;   In the nearby village of Raegelin, where three bombs felllast month, the top 33 feet of the town's church steeple wereremoved in the early 1970s to make it easier for warplanes ontheir way to the target range. &quot;It wouldn't have occurred toanyone to complain,&quot; says Hartmut Pieper, the town's mayor.   Working his way through the tall grass on the edge of afarm pond, Mr. Pieper points to a muddy gash -- the onlyevidence left from a bomb that slammed into the ground here,narrowly missing a group of children who were fishing.   &quot;We're just finding out that we have a voice in thesematters, and that's new for us,&quot; says Margaritt Gerlich, aspokeswoman for the Neuruppin chapter of the political groupNew Forum, which supports an immediate halt to all Sovietflights in the region.   While eager to see the Soviets leave, many East Germansseem to accept the past injustices as another legacy of thenation's troubled history. &quot;To most of them {the Soviets},we're still fascists -- whether we're East or West,&quot; saysJeorg Schultz, an unemployed truck driver.   Crouched over the bar at Zum Brauhof, one of Neuruppin'swatering holes, Mr. Schultz says that the Soviets liveseparate lives and that he prefers it that way. Theycertainly aren't welcome in this bar. &quot;They have their ownplaces,&quot; says Frank Grothe, the bartender.   Neuruppin, a shabby town dominated by spires of a12th-century church, reflects the tense relations that existbetween Soviets and East Germans. Although nearly as manySoviets live here -- about 28,000 -- as Germans, the twogroups almost never mix.   About the only point of daily contact is the town'scobblestoned main street, where Soviet officers and theirwives shop for goods not available in their own commissary.And this is where tempers really flare. East Germans complainthat the Soviets buy up whole stocks of scarce items, such aschildren's shoes.   There is a still darker side to the tensions. &quot;I wouldnever walk on a side street here alone at night,&quot; says ayoung East German housewife. &quot;There are simply too manystories about women attacked by soldiers.&quot;   Local officials say it is impossible to quantify theamount of crime linked to the Soviet air base, but even Mr.Frank, the former mayor, concedes, &quot;I don't know if thepolice were allowed to keep records of it.&quot;   The Soviets conduct their own foot patrols in Neuruppin --always two soldiers accompanied by an officer. Localscomplain, however, that their own police would never takeaction against a Soviet soldier. &quot;If I got jumped by aRussian, they'd ask me how I knew,&quot; says Mr. Grothe, thebartender. &quot;And if I said it was by the way he talked, theywould tell me the Poles talk the same way. Of course, we havea lot more Russians here than Poles.&quot;   The prospect of a Soviet pullout is giving some EastGermans a new sense of perspective. Mrs. Ohm, who says shewas very upset about damage to her house, has now decidedthat authorities did the best they could to make amends.Soviet troops cleared the rubble, and East German workersmade the repairs at no cost. The East German government evenbought her new furniture. &quot;At least they were fair,&quot; shesays. &quot;They fixed it up nicer than it was before theaccident.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
