(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Banks reopened, a trickle of mail wasdelivered and trash collection resumed in this hurricane-batteredcity Monday, but a cold downpour hindered efforts to restore powerand worsened damage to roofless homes.   Two inches of rain fell, and temperatures were in the 60s. An 80percent chance of showers was forecast for Tuesday.   ``It's going to make it harder to accomplish anything, going tomake everything a little more miserable,'' said Kay Robinson, ameteorologist with the National Weather Service.   At Isle of Palms, a barrier island where martial law wasdeclared to preserve order, residents boarded ferries for theirfirst look at destruction wrought by Hugo since they were evacuatedThursday. A bridge to the mainland and Charleston was wiped out.   Residents were allowed to fill one suitcase each before theywere asked to leave again. The shattered houses made the one-timeseaside paradise look like a war zone.   ``It looks like what happens after artillery fire,'' said TomHarper, a retired Air Force officer.   Residents of Garden City were still unable to return to theirelite resort community on a 60-mile stretch of South Carolina'scoast known as the Grand Strand. The town's entrance was guarded byNational Guardsmen, but that did not prevent looting.   ``There was a lady just filling her bags with stuff,'' saidshopowner Connie Brewer. ``I've caught people stealing here threedays straight. It's like stealing from a graveyard.''   It was far from a normal workday in Charleston, where electricalservice was restored to hospitals but hot meals and water fordrinking and bathing was were still in short supply.   Late Monday, Mayor Joseph P. Riley said the city's water systemwas pumping potable water and 400,000 residents did not have tocontinue boiling water before drinking it.   The downpour hampered utility crews toiling to string powerlines. In homes already hit by Hugo's blustery winds, rainwatercompounded matters by seeping through damaged roofs in this300-year-old city.   ``There's a greater chance of problems with hot wires because ofthe standing water,'' said Brian Duncan, a spokesman for SouthCarolina Electric andamp; Gas Co. ``When it's wet, it just slows youdown.''   Frustration grew in some of the hardest hit neighborhoods, whereresidents patched damaged roofs with plastic sheeting to keep outthe rain.   ``The whole town's going to be called `Hell Hole' soon. That'swhat it's going to be, one big hell hole,'' complained Gerald Dean.   Seven Candamp;S bank branches and automatic teller machines opened inCharleston, allowing residents to cash checks to buy gas and othersupplies. Other branches opened along the coast.   ``We've been out of money since Thursday,'' said Edith Myrick, acustomer who needed cash to buy gas and food.   ``I thought of everything in the world to prepare for the storm,but I didn't think of money,'' said Emmit Neal. ``We've got treesto cut down and you've got to have money to pay folks.''   John Jordan, a Candamp;S official in Charleston, said offices would beopen four hours a day until power is restored.   ``If it hadn't have been for the rain, we would have beenswamped,'' he said. ``We have some locations where there areliterally lines out the doors.''   Riley pleaded for donations of money, lumber, canned food,disposable diapers and clothing. He set up a relief hot line.``We've got a lot of people who are hurting here and they need ourhelp,'' he said.   A curfew remained in effect for Myrtle Beach and Charleston,where the National Guard patrolled with bayonetted M-16 rifles todiscourage looters. In North Carolina, about 550 National Guardsmenpatrolled, 350 of them in Mecklenburg County.   Power was restored Monday to more than 200,000 people in theCarolinas, but at least 546,000 remained without service. It couldbe a month before full service is restored, utility officials said.   The 12th strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland thiscentury slammed South Carolina with 135 mph winds late Thursday.The six-day rampage of Hugo and its remnants killed at least 61people _ at least 33 in the Caribbean and 28 in the United States.   ``We're looking at damage between $1 and $2 billion,'' said BobSheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,Fla. He toured the South Carolina coast Monday.   State and local officials have estimated damage at $3 billion ormore.   President Bush on Monday declared four inland North NorthCarolina counties as disaster areas eligible for federal help. Bushpreviously declared seven South Carolina counties disaster areas.   Insurance agents went house-to-house, gathering estimates andhanding out claim checks.   Some of Hugo's victims may not be able to rebuild under a statelaw designed to curb beach erosion by limiting development. Allreconstruction and repairs close to the water will require a permitfrom the South Carolina Coastal Council.   ``We are considering an order that will allow people to repairhouses provided they are less than 66 and two-thirds (percent)damaged,'' administrator Steve Moore said. The council will sendcrews out to confirm the damage before work can begin.   In Sumter, 180 miles inland, residents suffered through a fourthday without electricity, water and food.   ``We don't know what's going on, when we'll get help,'' KellyBrown said. ``We've had grits for the children for two days, butthe Sterno's giving out.''   In Myrtle Beach, beaches were off limits because ofcontamination from sewage. The problem was blamed on residents whorefuse to conserve water.   ``People just can't shower until they utterly can't stand eachother,'' said Pat Dowling, a city spokesman. ``They should alsoavoid flushing until it's absolutely necessary. If people don'tcooperate, we'll have to turn the water off.''   The storm also took its toll on more than half of the state'scotton crop, leveled much of the corn fields and put the soybeanharvest in doubt, officials said. Agricultural losses wereestimated at $45 million to $50 million.</TEXT></DOC>
