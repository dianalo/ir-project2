(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Earthquake-damaged homes collapsedunder the prodding of powerful aftershocks Thursday, renewing fearsamong hundreds of residents already too horrified to go indoors.   ``The whole neighborhood went outside. It's too scary insidewhen these things hit,'' resident Lucy Hernandez said hours afterthe series of aftershocks struck this quiet agricultural community70 miles south of San Francisco.   More than 150 homes in the narrow coastal valley will likely becondemned, many of those dealt the ultimate blow during theaftershocks to Tuesday's destructive 6.9-magnitude temblor, saidCity Clerk Lorraine Washington.   Preliminary estimates place damage at nearly $100 million _ some$24 million to homes and up to $75 million to industrial andcommercial buildings.   Watsonville is about 20 miles south of the epicenter of thequake.   ``Some stores on Main Street probably have to be demolished,''Washington said. The older brick and unreinforced concretestructures took the brunt of the latest shaking.   The quakes were too much for the historical St. Patrick'sCatholic Church, which withstood the 1906 quake. With itsunderpinnings crumbling, demolition is considered a certainty.   The violent rumbles sent chills through the 30,000 residents inthe predominantly Hispanic community, part of California'sso-called ``salad bowl'' region, where much of the nation'slettuce, asparagus and artichokes are grown.   Twenty miles northwest of Watsonville, in the seaside city ofSanta Cruz, authorities said as many as 10,000 people were believedto be homeless Thursday night.   Also Thursday, Santa Cruz County officials closed all beaches inthe city because of a sewage spill, and a strong aftershock thatstruck in the late afternoon caused more damage to a major highwayalready closed after Tuesday's temblor.   Earlier in the day, a rescue team pulled the body of 23-year-oldRobin Ortiz from under two tons of rubble that rained down on herwhen a downtown Santa Cruz coffee store collapsed during Tuesday'sdeadly earthquake.   The discovery brought a tragic end to an emotional conflictbetween searchers and the woman's friends, who had insisted thatMs. Ortiz might be alive and criticized rescue efforts as too slow.   Police said at least five people were arrested Wednesday nightwhen they broke through a barricade at the site of the Santa CruzCoffee Roasting Co. after being told that the search was beinghalted at dark.   In Watsonville, Washington said 400 to 500 residents soughtrefuge in shelters and another 500 were camping outside on lawns,in back yards, parks and empty fields.   ``These people don't want to go back home and don't want to goto the shelters. They feel safer outdoors than in a building,''Washington said.   Marcelina Toussaint, a 73-year-old woman wearing purple glovesand a felt beret, said she slept uneasily in a chair next to herfront door and made frequent dashes outside whenever the earthmoved.   ``I can't stop shaking,'' Mrs. Toussaint said. ``I guess I'msurviving, but I'm scared.''   Many residents who emptied out of their broken homes spreadacross lawns and vacant lots like refugees.   ``We're talking about people with no resources, no money forfood and no money for health care,'' said Barbara Garcia, executivedirector of Salud Pera La Gente, a state-funded community clinic.   ``I think the big thing now is that the aftershocks are reallyscaring people,'' Ms. Garcia said.   Hundreds of people spent the night at local Red Cross sheltersand churches and more than 100 camped in a vacant downtown lotdesignated as the future site of the Watsonville Post Office.   ``We have no place to live. The building cracked,'' said RaoulPerez, 36, who works in the lettuce fields.   Thirty children romped on a pile of clothing nearby as Perezadded, ``It's hard, especially for the kids, because we have nogas, water, special things for kids.''   At a shelter set up at a National Guard armory near the airport,scores of families sat on steel folding chairs and cots withblankets and clothing strewn everywhere.   Earthquake victims also found food and shelter at St. Patrick's.Even though the red brick church was shattered by the quake, theRev. Mike Miller voiced optimism during his Thursday sermon.   He reminded his congregation gathered in another churchbuilding, ``The foundation of the church is Christ, and that's anunshakeable rock. ... We've just lost a house (the church). We'llhave to build a new house.''   Miller, who also conducted prayer services at local shelters,said he found quake victims ``at peace and glad to have eachother.''   ``I guess what I'll remember most about the shelters were thepeople clinging to each other _ they were clinging to the rightthings,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
