The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theministry moved after the Supreme Court ruled last week the ban was``illegal ... a violation of constitutional provisions whichstipulate equal rights for men and women.''   The ministry said May 6 it would no longer issue permits formale ownership of beauty parlors and that male hairdressers couldno longer work in beauty shops.   The court also overturned the ownership provision of the decree,and it also was rescinded by the government.   The decree against men associated with beauty parlors was theresult of pressure by Islamic groups, especially the influentialMoslem Brotherhood Movement, which has the largest bloc in Jordan's80-seat parliament. Islamic tradition says men and women must notmingle in public, and women are supposed to keep their hair coveredin the presence of strange men.   But the ministry ban raised protests from moderate groups. Laborunions, womens' organizations and human rights activists alsolobbied against the ban.   Prime Minister Mudar Badran's government had earlier bowed todemands by Islamic groups that included banning alcohol on RoyalJordanian Airlines flights to Arab and Islamic countries. But herejected calls to close down bars and nightclubs in thispredominantly Moslem country of 3.1 million people.   The Moslem Brotherhood emerged as the strongest party inParliament when it won almost two dozen seats in last November'selections, the first in more than 22 years. Another dozenindependent Islamic activists were also elected.   The Brotherhood pledged to introduce stricter Islamic laws, banlewd TV programs and limit women's freedom, including prohibitingwomen from working.</TEXT></DOC>
