Valeo's decision isn't expected until this weekend, but financial sources say it is &quot;probable&quot; that the auto-parts group, an affiliate of Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti, will bow out of the race. The counterbid is supported by auto makers Peugeot S.A. and Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, which together account for about two-thirds of Valeo's sales.    Valeo launched its Epeda bid more than a month ago, offering 1,200 French francs ($198.27) a share for 60% of Epeda, valuing its bid at 2.4 billion francs ($396.5 million) and all of Epeda at four billion francs.    Epeda rejected the bid, and last week put together a 4.2 billion franc buy-out led by management. The group, whose bid the stockbrokers' association approved, is offering 1,250 francs a share and 600 francs per warrant for all of Epeda's capital. </TEXT></DOC>
