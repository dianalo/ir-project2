Kodak, which filed a motion seeking Judge Rya W. Zobel's withdrawal, also has asked that the judge's 1985 ruling that it infringed on Polaroid instant-photography patents be vacated. While some securities analysts said Kodak's motion to vacate has a chance of succeeding, some experts in legal ethics believe that is unlikely.    The case is important to both companies because Cambridge, Mass.-based Polaroid is seeking as much as $5.7 billion in damages from Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y. A trial date on the damages had been set for next January.    The issue revolves around Judge Zobel's mother-in-law, who owned Kodak stock throughout the patent-infringement trial and who recently died. Judge Zobel and her husband are beneficiaries of the estate. The judge disclosed at the start of the trial in 1981 that her mother-in-law owned 1,000 Kodak shares; as a result of stock splits, the total has increased to 2,250 shares with a market value of about $100,000. Neither Kodak nor Polaroid objected to Judge Zobel continuing on the case in 1981.    Kodak, in its recently filed motion, argues that Judge Zobel should have withdrawn from the case in 1981, and that all of her rulings since then should be vacated. That motion will be heard by Judge David Mazzone, to whom the case was assigned after Judge Zobel withdrew yesterday.    &quot;There is a very real probability that Eastman Kodak could get the judge's decisions from 1981 forward vacated,&quot; said Alex Henderson, an analyst at PrudentialBache Securities. Another analyst, who asked not to be identified, said, &quot;I think there is a good chance&quot; Kodak's motion will succeed.    However, some legal experts disagreed. &quot;It has very little chance of succeeding,&quot; said Stephen Gillers, an expert in legal ethics at New York University. &quot;Rya Zobel called the situation to the attention of the parties and they decided not to object (in 1981). She did what she was supposed to do.&quot;    Prof. Gillers said Judge Zobel was obligated to withdraw by law only if her mother-in-law had an interest that could &quot;substantially&quot; be affected by the outcome of the trial. The 2,250 shares doesn't constitute a substantial interest, he said.    Many analysts estimated that the award will be in the $1 billion range. If that is the case, the effect on each of Kodak's 324 million shares outstanding could thus be calculated at about $3 a share, Prof. Gillers noted. That would mean a potential loss of less than $7,000 on the judge's mother-in-law's holding, which is unlikely to be considered substantial, he added. Depending on how high the award is, however, it could be considered substantial, Prof. Gillers added.    Ronald Panitch, a Philadelphia patent attorney not involved in the case, also said it doesn't seem likely that the judge's earlier motions will be vacated.    Even so, the latest turn of events poses problem for Polaroid. For one thing, it could further delay the start of the already long-delayed damages trial. &quot;There's no way to know now,&quot; said a Polaroid spokesman.    In addition, analysts had viewed Judge Zobel as favorable to Polaroid based on her ruling that Kodak infringed on Polaroid's patents. Brenda Landry, an analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., said she dropped her &quot;buy&quot; recommendation on Polaroid last week because of the possibility that the judge might withdraw. &quot;I thought there might be a chance she would throw the book at Kodak,&quot; she said.    Michael Ellmann, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co., said that &quot;judging from the behavior of the stock (during the past week), it appears the market thinks this is ultimately good for Kodak and bad for Polaroid. But only time will tell.&quot;    Kodak closed yesterday at $45.50, up 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Polaroid slipped 87.5 cents to $31.50. </TEXT></DOC>
