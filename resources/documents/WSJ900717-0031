The decision, announced by President Mikhail Gorbachevafter two days of talks with West German Chancellor HelmutKohl, removes the last major hurdle to German unity. Mr.Gorbachev told a news conference that it was the right of asovereign Germany to choose which military alliance itbelonged to.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Whether we like it or not the time will come when aunited Germany will be in NATO if that is its choice,&quot; Mr.Gorbachev said. &quot;Then, if that is the choice, to some degreeand in some form it can work together with the Soviet Union.&quot;   President Bush, in a statement released by the WhiteHouse, hailed Gorbachev's remark, saying: &quot;This commentdemonstrates statesmanship, and strengthens efforts to buildenduring relationships based on cooperation.&quot;   In return for Mr. Gorbachev's concession, Mr. Kohl pledgedthat a united Germany will reduce the size of its army about40% to 370,000 men and negotiate a treaty with the Soviets ontroop withdrawals. The Soviets would be given three to fouryears to withdraw their 380,000 troops from East Germanterritory, during which time no non-German NATO troops wouldbe based in East Germany. A united Germany also wouldrenounce chemical weapons and join the nuclearnon-proliferation treaty.   The two sides agreed to work on a second treaty oneconomic, political and broader elements of the bilateralrelationship, to replace separate existing Soviet treatieswith East and West Germany.   The two leaders also discussed how West German economicaid could help save the Soviet economy. A reunited Germanywill be the Soviet Union's biggest trading partner by a widemargin.   In their televised news conference, Mr. Gorbachev said theagreement was a compromise. &quot;Politics is the art of thepossible,&quot; he said. &quot;In absolute terms, the West German sidedidn't get what it was counting on. In absolute terms, we inour turn did not get what we had been counting on. But wewere realists.&quot;   After months of resisting the idea of a united Germany inNATO, the Soviet Union finally bowed to the inevitable.Western nations all insist that a united Germany be anchoredin the Western alliance -- a position Mr. Kohl stronglysupports.   Mr. Gorbachev's change of heart was helped by severalfactors. He has just weathered a crucial Soviet CommunistParty Congress, in which he stifled harsh criticism of hisforeign policy and emerged with broad endorsement forcontinuing his policies. He also removed some of the toughesthard-liners who opposed German unity from the leadership,putting the party on a more moderate course.   Mr. Kohl sweetened the pill by agreeing to set a ceilingon future German troop strength, before final figures aredetermined at conventional arms reduction talks now takingplace in Vienna.   Soviet television showed scenes of the meetings at thesouthern Russian spa town of Mineralnye Vody. It was thefirst time Mr. Gorbachev had invited a Western leader totalks outside of Moscow and he appeared very relaxed. In anopen-necked shirt and sweater, Mr. Gorbachev was shownwalking through the woods, laughing and joking with Mr. Kohl.   TV pictures helped promote the image of a newly friendlypartnership. Most striking were the numerous Soviet veteransof World War II waving tiny West German flags and welcomingMr. Kohl.   This depiction is an abrupt turnaround for state-runtelevision. For decades, war movies have been popular fare inthe Soviet Union and the German threat has been a staple ofSoviet propaganda. At least 20 million Soviets died in WorldWar II.   Now, Mr. Gorbachev must shift public attention from thatbitter history to the generations of cooperation that havealso been part of the two countries' relations. A centralfactor in the new relationship will be a united Germany'sability to help Mr. Gorbachev's attempts to turn the SovietUnion into a market-based economy.   A senior West German official said before the meeting thatMr. Kohl would assure Mr. Gorbachev that Bonn plans to be hiseconomic partner, active in providing credits and technicalknow-how. West Germany has already given $3 billion incredits to the Soviet Union.   The official said a new aid package would includeassistance in establishing a transport system and managementtraining, two areas that Soviet economists and foreignbusinessmen say are essential before any economic reform canget off the ground. West Germany also would buy more oil andnatural gas from the Soviets, the proceeds from which Moscowcould use to finance the expanded relationship.   Economists in the Soviet Union have long been split intotwo camps -- those who see the U.S. as their best potentialpartner and those who believe the rosiest future lies inclose ties with a united Germany. Since Mr. Kohl visitedMoscow in 1988, West Germany has increasingly been viewed asa good model.   East Germany is already the Soviet Union's biggest tradingpartner in the East Bloc, as West Germany is in the West.Each one accounts for about 10% of the Soviet Union's totaltrade.   ---   Frederick Kempe in Berlin contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
