Every country in the world will be urged to attend, EnvironmentSecretary Nicholas Ridley told a news conference.   He said the aim of the meeting is to warn developing countries ofthe dangers of producing chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs.   Britain and its partners in the 12-nation European EconomicCommunity, along with 23 other countries signed the 1987 MontrealProtocol, which calls for production of CFCs to be cut by 50 percentof the 1986 levels by the end of the century. The protocol comesinto force on New Year's Day.   CFCs are used for propellants in aerosol sprays and in makingrefrigerators, firefighting equipment, disposable food cartons,plastic foam for insulation and in chemical cleaners in the computerindustry.   The United States, Canada, Scandinavian countries and the SovietUnion have banned their use as propellants.   Some scientists say CFCs are destroying the ozone layer ofprotective gases around the Earth which prevents the sun's harmfulultraviolet rays from reaching the surface. The rays are known tocause cancer.   CFCs are one of the ``greenhouse gases,'' which include carbondioxide produced by burning coal and oil and which threaten toprogressively warm up the atmosphere so as to melt the polar icecaps, raise sea level and change the climate.   Ridley said he will visit China Dec. 10 to persuade the Chineseto take part in the meeting.   ``A clear commitment is needed from all world governments,including those who have not yet signed the protocol, if we are tohave any chance of preventing further damage to the ozone layer. Itis not enough to set objectives. Our London conference must show howthey will be achieved in practice,'' Ridley said.   Ridley said Britain wants the global emission of CFCs to bereduced by at least 85 percent as soon as possible.   ``I am convinced of this urgent need by the latest scientificevidence,'' he added.   The London-based Friends of the Earth environmental group issueda statement hailing the new initiative.</TEXT></DOC>
