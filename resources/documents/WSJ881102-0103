The ruling could have far-reaching implications for takeover defenses. In recent days, other companies, like Interco, have turned to defenses based on recapitalization plans protected by poison pills. The pills -- or stock-rights plans -- are designed, when activated, to make hostile takeovers prohibitively expensive.    Unless reversed on appeal, the court's ruling would almost ensure a victory by the Rales in their long battle for control of Interco. The Washington-based investors, who launched their Interco bid in July, said yesterday their tender offer has garnered commitments to buy Interco stock representing 77% of the company's shares.    The Rales group had planned to complete its $74-a-share tender offer last night at midnight, at which time they conceivably could buy the tendered Interco shares. But it was expected that the group would extend its tender offer because the Delaware ruling is only a temporary block.    News of the court reversal pushed the company's stock up $4, closing at $71.75 in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.    Interco, maker of Ethan Allen furniture and Converse Shoes among other well-known products, was seeking an appeal of the decision last night. Having staked its entire defense on the recapitalization that was shielded by the pill, it wasn't clear what if any options the company had other than appealing the decision.    The Interco ruling is likely to be the most significant of several pending tests of the so-called business-judgment rule that guides corporate officers and directors in shaping takeover defenses. In yesterday's decision, Chancellor William T. Allen ruled that a company can't use the widespread poison-pill takeover defense to protect a defense recapitalization plan in the face of a comparable takeover offer from an unwanted suitor.    Merger-law experts say the ruling could restrict the use of recapitalizations, an increasingly popular takeover defense. &quot;The opinion is a major blow to targets because by nature recaps are difficult to evaluate,&quot; said Arthur Fleischer, Jr., a New York takeover attorney. &quot;The court's response evidences real cynicism about recaps and their values.&quot;    In a leveraged recapitalization, a company borrows heavily and sells assets. Proceeds are then used to pay shareholders a large, one-time dividend that is meant to compete with the unwanted suitor. Kraft Inc. briefly employed a recapitalization defense against Philip Morris Cos. before agreeing to a friendly merger, and many Wall Street merger experts expect Pillsbury Co. to use a similar plan against its hostile suitor, Grand Metropolitan PLC.    Ripping away the poison-pill shield from recapitalizations would force such plans to compete on equal terms with tender offers, a phenomenon that could severely limit their effectiveness in the face of a comparable tender offer. That's because in practice, arbitragers and professional traders invariably tender their shares to a hostile bidder, unless prevented from doing so by a pill.    Dennis Block, a New York takeover attorney, argued that the decision may also prevent poison-pill defenses of inadequate leveraged buy-outs. &quot;It's very important because it defines several concepts: this says you can't keep a pill in place to protect a buy-out offer,&quot; he said. &quot;It's also the first time a Delaware court has said, it's fine to do a recap, but you can't protect it with a pill.&quot;    Interco has held its poison-pill defense in place, in effect using it as a shield to protect its recapitalization against the Rales' $74-a-share tender offer. The Interco board deemed the Rales' offer &quot;inadequate.&quot; And unlike Kraft, which had planned to put its recapitalization plan to a shareholder vote, Interco planned no such vote. It argued that dropping its defenses would constitute a threat to shareholders by endangering its recapitalization, which it valued at $76 a share.    The court disagreed. It ruled that, in the final stages of Interco's takeover battle, the pill's sole function has become &quot;to preclude the shareholders from exercising a judgment about their own interests that differs from the judgment of the directors, who will have some interest in the question.&quot;    Chancellor Allen reserved some harsh words for one of Wall Street's hottest takeover advisers, Interco adviser Wasserstein Perella andamp; Co. Citing a fee arrangement that pays the firm more if Interco's restructuring is completed, the court said, &quot;Wasserstein Perella has a rather straightforward and conventional conflict of interest when it opines that the inherently disputable value of its restructuring is greater than the all-cash alternative offered by {Rales}.&quot;    Moreover, the court characterized the restructuring's $76-a-share value put forward by Wasserstein Perella as &quot;a highly debatable proposition.&quot; Whatever the restructuring's value, the court added, it wasn't sufficiently different from the Rales' bid to constitute a threat to shareholders. &quot;The threat here . . . is far too mild to justify&quot; preventing a shareholder vote, the court concluded.    Yesterday's ruling represents a further refinement of the business-judgment rule, which has been the subject of numerous rulings, many of them in Delaware, since 1985. Takeover experts said the latest decision doesn't prevent target companies from using poison pills to defend legitimate auction processes. And it doesn't address the extent to which target companies can grant special favors to friendly suitors, a matter now before the Delaware Supreme Court in a case involving the takeover attempt of Macmillan Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
