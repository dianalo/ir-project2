The Labor Department said overall productivity in the non-farmsector of the economy was up at an annual rate of 2.1 percent inthe July-September period, nearly double the revised 1.1 percentannual-rate gain posted in the second quarter.   But that improvement was overshadowed by other data in thereport suggesting that the manufacturing slump is far from over andthat wage inflation remains stubborn despite a recent moderation inconsumer price increases.   ``Manufacturing is clearly soft,'' said David Wyss of theDRI-McGraw Hill forecasting firm. ``The economy is slowing down andthat is going to be felt disproportionately by manufacturing.''   Added Merrill Lynch's Donald Straszheim: ``Manufacturing is notlikely to improve much until well into next year.''   The 1.4 percent annual-rate gain in manufacturing productivityin the third quarter was off dramatically from the revisedsecond-quarter improvement of 3.7 percent. The third-quarter numberrepresented the smallest productivity increrase since the fourthquarter of 1987.   Output in manufacturing was up just 1.3 percent at an annualrate in the third quarter _ its smallest gain since 1986 _ andhours worked in American factories declined 0.1 percent at anannual rate after falling a revised 0.2 percent in the secondquarter.   September unemployment data showed a 103,000 drop inmanufacturing employment, a sign to analysts that manufacturerswere trying to cut costs and boost productivity.   But the outlook remains bleak for the next several months, theanalysts said, because rising unit labor costs will exacerbate thealready unfavorable position most U.S. manufacturers findthemselves in in world markets.   Indeed, the Labor Department said unit labor costs rose at arapid 4.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter after falling ata revised annual rate of 1.0 percent in the second quarter. It wasthe largest quarterly increase in unit labor costs in manufacturingsince a 9.7 percent annual gain in the first quarter of 1982.   The overall numbers for the non-farm sector were somewhat moreencouraging but still underscored the recent economic slowdown andthe persistent upward pressure on wages.   The 2.1 percent annual-rate non-farm productivity gain resultedfrom a 3.1 percent rise in output and just a 1.0 percent gain inhours worked. The increase in hours worked was the lowest in morethan three years.   Hourly compensation in the entire non-farm sector rose at anannual rate of 5.3 percent in the non-farm sector, down from thesecond quarter annual-rate gain of 5.6 percent but still evidenceof underlying inflationary pressures.   ``Inflation is still a very serious problems,'' said ElliottPlatt, a senior vice president and Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette.   The productivity gain helped offset the impact of wage gains onunit labor costs in the overall non-farm sector. They increased atan annual rate of 3.2 percent in the third quarter after rising ata revised 4.5 percent in the second quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
