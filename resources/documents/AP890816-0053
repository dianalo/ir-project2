Mickey Leland and 15others who were killed when their plane crashed into a cliff insouthwestern Ethiopia.   The bodies arrived in Ethiopia's capital Tuesday evening.Helicopters were used to remove them from the wreckage of theirlight plane, a Twin Otter, on the steep slopes of mile-high Tammountain.   Seven Ethiopians and nine Americans _ including Leland, a TexasDemocrat who chaired the House Select Committee on Hunger _ died inthe crash Aug. 7 en route to a refugee camp near the Sudan border.The plane crashed about 100 miles short of its destination.   ``Ethiopian and U.S. authorities declare that all bodies havebeen recovered,'' Marine Lt. Col. David Titus said later in astatement read to reporters.   Additional medical personnel were to arrive in Addis Ababa todayto help the forensic experts already on hand identify the bodiesbefore the Americans are returned to the United States for burial.   Titus said the task of identifying the dead probably would takefive to seven days. The work was being done at a clinic at AddisAbaba's international airport.   Members of an investigating team from the United States andCanada flew to the crash site this morning to examine the wreckagefor the cause of the accident.   They included members of the U.S. National Transportation SafetyBoard and representatives of the Boeing and Pratt and Whitneycompanies, which made the airframe and engines of the Canadian-builtTwin Otter.   The Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority is coordinating theinvestigation.   Leland, 44, and his party were heading to the Fugnido refugeecamp about 480 miles southwest of this capital when the accidentoccurred.   Heavy clouds, rain and low visibility were believed to have ledto the crash.   After a six-day search, rescuers Sunday found the wreckage andbodies strewn over about a quarter-mile wide region of the5,500-foot mountain.   The Fugnido camp is one of four in southwestern Ethiopia run bythe U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. They house more than300,000 Sudanese who have fled war and famine in their neighboringcountry.   Leland, a six-term representative from Houston, was mourned as achampion of the homeless and hungry throughout the world.   Funeral plans for Leland include a memorial service to be held at7:30 p.m. Friday at the Texas Southern University campus in Houston.Mass will be said at 10 a.m. Saturday at St. Anne's Catholic Churchin Houston.
