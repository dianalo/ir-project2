Intravenous DSAwas particularly useful in the follow-up of patients with an establisheddiagnosis of Takayasu arteritis. Pulmonary arterial involvement couldalso be demonstrated with intravenous DSA as obstructive arterial changesand lack of accumulation of contrast medium in the pulmonary parenchyma.Detailed information concerning the site and extent of vascular involvementand development of collateral vessels were obtained with intraarterialDSA. Thickening of the thoracic aortic wall, however, could not be recognizedwith either intravenous or intraarterial DSA. Conventional angiographyof the descending thoracic aorta is still required as an initial examination,particularly when there is no aortic arch involvement. However, thereis no doubt that DSA has the potential to become the diagnostic procedureof choice in Takayasu arteritis.</TEXT></DOC>
