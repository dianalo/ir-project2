It quoted the source as saying that no intermediaries wereinvolved.   ``A settlement to the hostages' issue will coincide with theU.S. presidential elections'' Nov. 8, the report said. It did notelaborate.   The magazine gained international fame when it broke the storyof secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in return for the release ofhostages in 1986. But most of its recent reports on the hostageshave not proved accurate.   Iran's Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said Wednesday hiscountry would be prepared to help get the hostages released ifPresident Reagan released frozen Iranian assets.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater respondedto Rafsanjani's offer by saying: ``No deals. The clearest signalthey could send is to release the hostages.''   The longest held hostage is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was seized in westBeirut on March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
