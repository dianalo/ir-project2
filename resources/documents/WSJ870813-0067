A report on mothers and families in the work force by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that in March, 52% of mothers with children one year old or younger were on the job or looking for work, up from 43% five years ago and 32% in 1977.    Participation in the labor force by mothers whose youngest child was between two and five years old also has risen in the past decade, but not as much. These mothers in the work force ranged from 59% of the total for those whose youngest child was two years old to 63% for those whose youngest child was five years old, compared, respectively, with a range of 52% to 57% in 1982 and a range of 42% to 51% in 1977.    Overall, three-fifths of the nation's children under 18 were in families with a working or job-seeking mother, up from 55% five years ago and 48% in 1977, the report showed. It said that 80% of divorced mothers, who tend to be older, were in the labor force, while 56% of never-married mothers were in the work force. </TEXT></DOC>
