Gorbachev, wrapping up a historicvisit, called Wednesday for demilitarizing the Chinese-Sovietborder and said unrest in China is part of a necessary process ofevolution for the communist nation.   On the last full day of his trip, the Soviet president said hehoped the mass protests that have disrupted the Beijing summitwould end in a negotiated settlement.   ``A difficult, painful but political dialogue is going onbetween the leadership, the youth and the public concerning theseevents, and it seems to me that we should welcome that fact,'' hesaid.   As the Soviet leader spoke, more than 1 million Chinese pouredinto the streets to demonstrate for democratic reforms in China.The protests spread to at least 20 provincial capitals, includingShanghai, where at least 70 students were on a hunger strike.   Gorbachev on Thursday traveled to Shanghai, where he waswelcomed by the city's Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, andMayor Zhu Rongji. He was to conclude his four-day trip with a tourof a special economic zone, one of the showcases of economic reformthat the Soviet Union is trying to emulate.   At a news conference Wednesday, Gorbachev defended socialistcountries experiencing unrest as they attempt to make reforms.   ``If anyone thinks this will lead us to the ash heap of history,I think they will be disappointed again,'' he said.   Earlier, in a nationally televised interview, Gorbachev said thesummit that normalized relations between the nations went well``despite all the tensions'' from the huge demonstrations that havealtered his itinerary.   He said he felt welcome in the city, where no Soviet leader hadset foot for three decades.   In a speech to Chinese academics in the Great Hall of thePeople, Gorbachev urged that the 4,300-mile frontier where 1.6million troops now face each other be turned into a ``border ofpeace and good neighborliness.''   He said an earlier pledge to withdraw 200,000 troops from Asiawould be fulfilled by the end of next year and would include thepullout of 12 divisions, or 120,000 soldiers, from the border.   The Soviet Union is believed to have about 600,000 troops alongthe border. The Chinese, armed with less modern equipment, havemore than 1 million troops stationed there.   Gorbachev said 11 air force regiments would be disbanded and 16warships would be removed from the Pacific Fleet.   Gorbachev also said:   _ Soviet and Chinese negotiating positions on Cambodia are``very, very close'' to each other but that the two sides failed toagree on a satisfactory settlement of the struggle, in whichSoviet-backed Vietnamese occupation forces are battlingChinese-backed Cambodian guerrillas.   He said there is now ``light at the end of the tunnel.''   _ The United States should withdraw its forces from South Koreain a bid to resolve that regional touble spot.   _ Chinese-Soviet trade, which the two sides hope will increasewith normalization, ``presents a poor picture'' at present, but newventures between the two countries and completion of a new railline linking Beijing and Moscow should improve trade.   _ All Asian and Pacific countries, with U.N. help, should set upa mechanism for resolving regional disputes that still threatenpeace in the region, most notably now in Cambodia and Afghanistan.   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union is ``prepared to work for thewithdrawal, on terms to be agreed with China, of military units andarmaments from the border areas, leaving only the personnelrequired for performing routine border guard duties.''   ``Demilitarizing the Soviet-Chinese border and turning it into aborder of peace and good-neighborliness is a noble goal which wecould attain through joint efforts,'' he said.   On Tuesday, in a meeting with Premier Li Peng, Gorbachev said,``We want the Soviet-Chinese border to be protected only byfriendship.'' He also called for regular consultations between themilitaries of the two countries.   The two sides fought a brief border war over the disputedfrontier in 1969, and sporadic clashes have continued over theyears. But tensions have slowly eased during the 1980s.   On Monday, the day Gorbachev arrived in Beijing, Moscow beganpulling troops out of Mongolia, the Soviet ally along China'snorthern border. The Kremlin has said it will withdraw 50,000troops, three-fourths of the Soviet force in Mongolia, by the endof 1990.   Chinese leaders have generally welcomed the Soviet troopreduction, while claiming that it has not yet gone far enough.   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, head of the Chinese military, alsohas reduced the People's Liberation Army from more than 4 millionin 1985 to about 3 million today. Most of those troops arestationed along the Soviet border and China's volatile border withVietnam.   China and other Asian nations have been cool to Gorbachev'sconcept of collective security in Asia, expressing fear it is aSoviet attempt to increase its strategic influence in the area.   Gorbachev, however, said collective efforts were ``of cardinalimportance both for Asia and for the entire world.''   He also spoke of his talks with Deng and other Chinese leaders,saying they were an ``important milestone'' and that ``a longperiod of mutual alienation is now behind us.''   On Tuesday the two sides announced the normalization ofgovernment and party relations, ending a 30-year rift caused byideological and strategic differences.</TEXT></DOC>
