American intelligence received word in the autumn of 1985 thatImad Mugniyeh, a Lebanese Shiite linked to terrorist attacks, wasvisiting France and proposed that he be abducted to the UnitedStates for trial, said the official, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   The State Department, fearing the action would cause a majorblowup in U.S.-French relations, argued successfully against theplan and a decision was made to ask French authorities to arrestMugniyeh. France did not act on the request, the official said.   National Public Radio, which first disclosed the plan in abroadcast Wednesday morning, said its sources disagreed on whetherPresident Reagan approved the plan. At any rate, the broadcastsaid, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and FBI Director WilliamWebster scuttled the proposal.   NPR said the idea was conceived by William J. Casey, thendirector of the Central Intelligence Agency, but that it was nevercompletely proven that Mugniyeh was in France at the time hisabduction was to be carried out.   In early 1986, following a second report of Mugniyeh's presencein France, local authorities did act on the U.S. request and wentto a hotel to arrest him. But instead of a Lebanese terrorist,police found a family of vacationers, NPR reported.   Mugniyeh has been identified by U.S. terrorism experts as theleader of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed group held responsiblefor the kidnapping of westerners in Lebanon, including AssociatedPress Chief Middle East Correspondent Terry Anderson and severalother Americans.   Mugniyeh is under indictment in the United States on charges ofparticipating in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and thekilling of Navy diver Robert Stethem, one of the passengers.   State Department officials have also said they suspect thatMugniyeh was involved in last month's hijacking of a Kuwaitijetliner, which was held for two weeks by gunmen demanding therelease of more than two dozen Shiite Moslems being held onterrorism charges in Kuwait. Mugniyeh's brother-in-law is said tobe one of the prisoners.   The plane hijackers disappeared in Algeria after they releasedtheir remaining hostages.   The U.S. official who spoke of the proposal to abduct Mugniyehsaid ``there's always a lot of brainstorming about this sort ofthing. It was an idea that was floated. People were saying, `Howcan we do this?'''   ``The State Department felt strongly that if something like thiswas to be done it could not be through secret connivance _ therehad to be a decision by French political authorities to arrest himand turn him over to the United States,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
