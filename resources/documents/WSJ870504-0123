John Dingell's threat to do something about insider trading and takeovers has been building a head of steam for some time. Now the bill has made it to his Energy and Commerce Committee. If passed, the market burn will be third degree.    The Michigan Democrat claims his plan would protect incumbent managers and help stop &quot;insider trading,&quot; while doing no harm to the economy. No way. The key provision would burden potential acquirers of corporations, undermining the market for corporate control, increasing the likelihood of insider trading.    There is a huge misunderstanding about the causes of insider trading, as the Senate Banking Committee recently discovered during a four-and-a-half-hour hearing on the subject. The senators heard from the two men in America whose lives revolve around investigating insider trading -- Rudolph Giuliani, the federal prosecutor in Manhattan, and Gary Lynch, who runs the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division.    First, Mr. Lynch's explanation:    &quot;The amount of money that can be made in trading on inside information concerning an impending takeover is generally going to be much larger than the amount of money one can make trading on other types of inside information. Couple that with the fact that in the mid-70s not only was there an increase {in corporate takeovers} up to and through the early part of the '80s but also there was the advent of listed-option trading so that someone could take a position and control a very large amount of securities with a relatively small investment. We had one case where someone invested $3,000 in an options position and 24 hours later that $3,000 position was worth $430,000.&quot;    Now Mr. Giuliani's:   &quot;Very often these are people from what you would regard as very decent backgrounds and graduates from very good educational institutions. There doesn't appear to be a reason for why they would be violating the law and I am sure this is by no means the sole reason, but I do think that in the last 20, 30 or 40 years the institutions in our society that we've relied on to teach values have to some extent deteriorated. They don't have as much control over as many people as they had in the past. Fewer people grow up in stable families. . . . Fewer people go to church. Fewer people exist and grow up in communities where commonly accepted values are inculcated.    &quot;. . . You have to expose young people to ethical values at a very early age, including the reasons for our legal system, the reasons we have laws, the reasons why you have to cede some autonomy to lawful authority, some of the basic ethical notions of Plato and Socrates and Aristotle that have nothing to do with anybody's particular religion.&quot;    Listed-options trading no doubt speeds profits. And if he runs for office, Mr. Giuliani has a great campaign-stump speech on education in a society plagued by moral relativism. But both men missed the mark wildly. The fundamental culprit is not the facet of human nature called greed, but the piece of legislation called the Williams Act.    Think of Rep. Dingell as the reincarnation of Harrison Williams. Mr. Williams's 1968 bill entrenched many incumbent managers from that decade's takeover wave. Its main provision forced potential acquirers to disclose their plans for a tender offer within 10 days after purchasing 5% of the target stock. Managers of target firms now get the time to adopt poison pills. No longer can an acquirer offer to pay a premium in the open market and get control within a few days. One unanticipated result was that the inside information of an impending takeover is known to more people. Another was that the act created the field of takeover arbitrage. Arbs now buy up shares that the acquirer is forbidden to buy on his own, then sell them back to the highest bidder.    Mr. Dingell's bill would make matters worse. It requires raiders to disclose that they've bought 5% within 24 hours. It would also forbid the bidder from buying any more stock for two days after filing with the SEC. The arbs would fill this vacuum.    We have often argued that the restructuring of American business through takeovers, or the threat of takeovers, has generally been a good thing. The market for corporate control does help maximize share price. We especially oppose restraints on the free market for shares if the result will be to create incentives for stealing confidential information.    Instead of Mr. Dingell's plan to make the Williams Act even tougher on acquirers, the better idea is to abolish the act. Acquirers would again pay premium prices in the open market to shareholders, who would get the lion's share of the profits. Raiders would get control, not greenmail.    A return to pre-1968 open-market takeovers wouldn't please everyone. Managers of inefficient firms couldn't adopt defensive tactics. Bankers and lawyers would play lesser roles for lesser fees. The arbs might retire to teach Socrates and Aristotle. </TEXT></DOC>
