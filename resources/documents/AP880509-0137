Hale Champion has been a reporter, a Harvard official, an aideto California Gov. Pat Brown and a health official in the Carteradministration.   Balding, rotund and 65, Champion gives the impression that he'sseen it all and that nothing fazes him _ not complaininglegislators or angry lobbyists, budget shortfalls or the way thenews media covers it all.   To read one Boston newspaper, Dukakis' chief secretary said inan interview last week, ``you would have thought blood was coursingthrough the corridors of the Statehouse, entrails draped over thebalconies.   ``Where? Who? I mean it's simply a bunch of people doing theirwork.''   Just doing your job. ``That's the way he looks at it,'' Championsaid of his boss, the governor who has risen to become theDemocratic presidential front-runner. ``Sometimes that's why peoplethink he's not exciting enough, not emotional enough.''   But, said Champion, ``that's what I like about him. I meanthat's what gets things done. That's what gets things taken careof, not emoting hour after hour.   ``And if that says I am unemotional about those things, maybe Iam.''   Champion's strength is that ``there isn't anything that he canthink of that he hasn't seen before,'' said Dukakis' presssecretary James Dorsey. ``He's sort of like a deeply setfoundation'' for the administration.   Champion himself was a press secretary, and then executivesecretary and finance director for Brown, who was Ronald Reagan'spredecessor as governor of California.   His career also includes financial vice presidencies at theUniversity of Minnesota and Harvard University; a stint as directorof the Boston Redevelopment Authority, when he first met Dukakis,and two years as undersecretary to Joseph Califano at theDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare in the Carteradministration.   He was in semi-retirement as executive dean of Harvard's KennedySchool of Government when Dukakis tapped him to become his chiefsecretary a year ago.   ``I was never interested in working, you need to understand,''he said with a smile. ``He resisted my arguments and persuaded mywife, and here I am.''   Considering Champion's background and symmetry of thinking withDukakis, little had to be discussed between the two on what the jobentailed. ``He and I both assumed that I knew what `minding thestore' meant,'' Champion said.   He has faced comparisons to John Sasso, the politically savvy,longtime Dukakis associate who had been chief secretary beforemoving over to run the campaign. Sasso later left over his part inthe ``attack video'' episode that helped drive Sen. Joseph Bidenfrom the presidential race.   Some lawmakers have criticized the lack of courting they getfrom Champion. ``I don't do as much of it as John did ... neverwill, never did when I did this kind of job before (for Brown),''Champion said.   But he keeps in close contact with legislative leaders, and thatto Champion is most important.   While Champion frequently remarks on how there is nothing newunder the sun in his job, there are some aspects that are differentin keeping an administration going while the chief executive isrunning for president.   First, he must make sure Dukakis is abreast of events back inthe state while the governor spends three or more days a week onthe campaign trail. Second, he has been chiefly in charge ofbringing Dukakis' constitutional successor, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy,more into the daily operations of the administration.   And third, he has found that virtually every administrationinitiative _ from a universal health care bill to the state budget_ and many bills being pushed by individual lawmakers are publiclycast in the context of the impact on Dukakis' presidential campaign.   ``At first I did get a little bit (upset),'' said Champion.``It's ridiculous, but it's every single thing.''   But Champion said Dukakis and his administration have tried tosolve any problems in that area by living the old saying, ``What'sgood politics is good government.''   ``If you look like you are doing what you ought to be doinggenerally, as against a gimme here and a gimme there, that's thebest politics,'' Champion said. ``As a matter of fact, that's whyMichael is where he is today, because he has always taken that kindof attitude.''   Champion said he isn't interested in a return trip to Washingtonif Dukakis is elected. Rather, he's counting down the last monthshe believes he will be in his present post and is looking beyondthe part-time teaching position waiting for him at Harvard. Whathe's really looking forward to, he said, ``is that time when I amnot even teaching.''</TEXT></DOC>
