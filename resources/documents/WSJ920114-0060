While that means a wild ride for the stock market,analysts said, it's better than no futures at all.   On Monday, futures-related selling sent the stock market'sNikkei 225-stock average down 685.04 points, or 3.06%, to21696.86, after a drop Friday of 731.74.</LP><TEXT>   On Tuesday, the Nikkei index rose 275.68 points to closethe morning session at 21972.54.   Monday's volume was lackluster at 180 million shares,compared with 225.7 million shares Friday. Declinesoutnumbered gains 905-74, with 115 issues ending unchanged.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of allfirst-section issues, which fell 39.25 points Friday, sank40.32 points, or 2.43%, to 1619.84.   Of the six trading days in Tokyo this year, Monday markedthe fourth in which the Nikkei moved more than 600 points.The market at Monday's finish was down 1286.91 points fromits 1991 closing level.   Trading was spiced by word of a police raid on the officesof former State Minister Fumio Abe, who allegedly receivedabout 80 million yen ($630,800) in bribes from Kyowa, adefunct steel-frame maker. &quot;There's heightened concern thatmore names {of politicians} will come out,&quot; said Dan O'Keefe,research analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. The prospect ofanother scandal like the 1989 Recruit affair &quot;kept a lot ofpeople on the sidelines,&quot; he said.   Otherwise, the selling pressures were familiar:liquidation of investment trusts by Japanese fund managerskeen to clear their books before the new fiscal year beginsin April; a shift to interest-bearing deposits before thenext interest-rate cut by the Bank of Japan; anddisappointment about the near-term outlook for corporateprofits.   But all these influences have been around for weeks, sowhy do stock prices continue to swing so much? Traders saidthe volatility reflects a highly active &quot;derivatives&quot; market,particularly for Nikkei futures, and an otherwise slow marketfor stocks. Japanese derivatives also include Nikkei options,and futures and options on the Topix, a broader marketmeasure.   Nikkei futures are sold at a much lower commission thanstocks, and this makes them an attractive play for manyinvestors who have wearied of the high commission rates inthe cash market. &quot;The same value exposure on the futuresmarket as a basket of 1,000 shares of each one of the stocksin the Nikkei 225 will cost you one-sixth as much incommissions,&quot; said Craig Chudler, research departmentstrategist at UBS Phillips andamp; Drew International.   Based on the value of underlying securities, Tokyostock-market derivatives trading in the past two years hasfar outstripped daily activity in the cash market, whereturnover has declined sharply since the 1990 crash.   One outcome has been an increase in the popularity ofarbitrage trading between the futures and cash markets. Largesecurities companies marshal huge sums of cash to tradeblocks of each of the 225 stocks in the Nikkei, profiting ongaps in value between the cash and futures markets. Foreignsecurities houses such as Salomon Bros. Asia and GoldmanSachs (Japan) are regarded as the masters of this strategy.   In a low-volume cash market, exploiting such discrepanciescan represent a significant amount of daily activity,analysts said. And the sheer size of these shares moving in asingle direction means big price swings.   Japanese players continue to make up most of the futuresmarket, however. Fund managers find the futures market auseful place to hedge their stock portfolios, particularlygiven the poor trading volume in the cash market.   &quot;A fund manager who holds lots of equities may want tosell, but he can't,&quot; for fear a large sale would lower thevalue of his stock even before he could complete thetransaction, said Norio Yamaguchi, general manager ofinvestment strategy at ABN AMRO Securities (Japan) Ltd. &quot;Buthe can sell on the futures market.&quot;   Futures also are attractive to brokerage houses tradingfor their own accounts, noted Mr. O'Keefe of Merrill Lynch.&quot;Nobody's in the market for cash stocks,&quot; he said. &quot;One wayfor dealers to make money is to bet on the futures one way orthe other.&quot;   But while the ability to hedge in the futures market maylead to greater daily volatility in the stock market, in thelong run it takes pressure off the Nikkei average, analystssaid. &quot;If we didn't have the futures market, the Nikkei mightbe below 20000,&quot; Mr. Yamaguchi said. &quot;Instead, we're near theshort-term bottom of the range.&quot;   Nevertheless, the big price swings appear to worrygovernment regulators, who recently raised marginrequirements on some derivatives contracts. According toJapanese news reports, regulators have considered raisingcommission rates on futures transactions to bring them inline with the cost of stock purchases. The reverse -- lowercommission charges on stocks -- is expected eventually, but aquick deregulation of stock commissions would probably sinkmany of Japan's smaller brokerage houses.   &quot;If {regulators} cut commissions, it would throw a lot ofbrokers out of business,&quot; Mr. Chudler said, adding that &quot;itwould {also} push the market up 5,000 points&quot; as stocksbecame relatively more attractive.   Instead, &quot;regulators are moving in the wrong way,&quot; hesaid. &quot;The futures market allows investors to hold their{cash} positions and sell the market. Regulators should beencouraging this.&quot;   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-shareindex rose 12.2 points to 2490.1, only slightly off the day'shigh of 2491.6. The FT 30-stock index gained 14.7 points to1888.9. Volume was 429.3 million shares, compared with 589.7million shares in the previous session. Volume thinned on thefirst day of the new two-week trading account.   In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index rose 6.96 points to1622.67. Though some analysts believe the index could fall toas low as 1400 in the current quarter, many German funds andprivate investors consider current stock prices cheap andhave begun selective buying. Domestic buying was attributedto growing speculation that Germany's central bank could soonlower a benchmark interest rate if unions, which aredeadlocked over wage demands, settle for less than theyinitially sought.   Among corporate developments, in London, Pearson rose 9pence, or 1.3%, to 727 pence ($13.02). The diversifiedprinting concern said that after a review of Mirror GroupNewspapers' finances, Pearson isn't interested in pursuing anacquisition of the troubled media company.
