The company, Sudbury Inc.'s RDandamp;D unit and its Vienna, Va.,sales agent, RDandamp;D International, have been underinvestigation since summer by federal customs authorities forpossible violation of U.S. export law, according toindividuals familiar with the inquiry.</LP><TEXT>   The investigation is one piece of a broader customs effortto uncover U.S. companies that illegally provided arms toIraq. So far, the investigation has centered on the nowdefunct Matrix-Churchill Corp. of Solon, Ohio, whichallegedly funneled U.S. munitions-making equipment to Iraq;the Atlanta branch of Italy's biggest bank, Banca Nazionaledel Lavoro, which is said to have financed the sales; andSafa al-Habobi, Iraq's chief arms procurement agent.   As part of the RDandamp;D inquiry, customs agents in Newark,N.J., two weeks ago seized two RDandamp;D-made lathes that had beendestined for Iraq. The lathes, manufactured at RDandamp;D'sfacility in Erie, were procured by Iraqi arms agents tomanufacture loading mechanisms for 155mm howitzers, theindividuals said. But the lathes never left Newark, becausethe war -- and President Bush's unilateral trade embargo --put a halt to all Iraqi exports in August.   Nevertheless, the individuals expect that the governmentwill contend that sales agent RDandamp;D International and itspresident, Dale Toler, deliberately falsified an exportlicense application to conceal the real use of the lathes.According to the application, signed by Mr. Toler, the latheswere to have been used to make oil-field equipment.   Mr. Toler, reached at his office in Vienna, Va., said hewas unaware of the customs investigation and denied that heviolated U.S. export laws. &quot;It is ridiculous to say wefalsified any documents at all,&quot; Mr. Toler said. &quot;They'reordinary lathes. As far as we know, they were to make oilfield equipment.&quot;   RDandamp;D officials in Erie didn't return phone calls.Officials at Sudbury, the parent company based in Cleveland,declined to comment.   A spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service also declined tocomment. One government official close to the investigation,however, asserted: &quot;We're firm in our position, and Mr. Tolerwill be hearing from us.&quot;   Federal authorities are convinced that there wasdeliberate falsification of export declarations in this casebecause blueprints for the lathes were found last year in theLondon office of Iraqi arms agent Gerald Bull. Theindividuals said the blueprints show that the lathes wereintended to manufacture mechanisms for 155mm howitzer parts.   Mr. Bull, a Canadian-born artillery specialist who onceworked with the U.S. Army, was murdered in Brussels lastyear. He is believed to have provided Iraq with designs for anumber of weapons, including huge steel tubes supplied byBritish manufacturers that were to have been used in a&quot;supergun.&quot; Police are still searching for the professionalkiller who used a silenced pistol to shoot Mr. Bull fivetimes outside his apartment.   Federal authorities also are intrigued by several otherdetails in the RDandamp;D case. Mr. al-Habobi, Iraq's chief armsprocurement agent and a principal player in theMatrix-Churchill case, is known to have visited RDandamp;Dofficials in Erie, the individuals said. Moreover, thepurchase was financed by a letter of credit with the Atlantaoffice of BNL, the Italian bank.   Customs officials have discussed the case with the U.S.attorney's office in Erie, and are said to be consideringseeking an indictment once the U.S. State Department officefor munitions-export has reviewed its findings.</TEXT></DOC>
