The disclosure by IBM Chairman John F. Akers substantiatedearlier eports that MCI wants to repurchase the stake, which IBMbought three years ago when the long-distance telecommunicationscompany was weaker than it is now. MCI's profit and revenue havesince risen significantly.   Akers' statement also further weakened a theory that IBM'soriginal interest in MCI would lead to a major confrontation withAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., the long-distance phone giantthat also has been trying to develop a computer vending business.   Since then, ATandamp;T's performance in the computer market has beenconsidered disappointing, while IBM's attempts to develop itstelecommunications business also has been slow.   Akers spoke in response to a shareholder question Monday atIBM's annual meeting in Richmond, Va. He was asked about futureplans for the company's investment in MCI.   ``We don't have any plans to increase our holdings with MCI,although contractually they can ask us to, if they so desire,''Akers said. He added that was unlikely because of MCI's desire torepurchase the stock.   ``I would expect that would come to pass and that will be theaction that you'll see over the next several years,'' Akers said.   IBM initially made the investment, then valued at about $427million, under an agreement whereby MCI acquired the assets ofSatellite Business Systems, a competing long-distance phone companystarted by IBM in 1975.</TEXT></DOC>
