In addition, Chrysler Corp. would install driver-side air bags on most of its 1990-model cars if the deadline were moved back, said Christopher Kennedy, the company's director of federal government affairs. The number could total well over a half million, Chrysler officials said.    In 1985, the last full year for which production figures are available, Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford made 1.6 million cars and Chrysler, based in Highland Park, Mich., made 1.3 million.    Both Mr. Kennedy and Helen Petrauskas, Ford vice president for environmental and safety engineering, testified yesterday at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing. Their statements, which came in response to repeated questioning by Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.), an air bag champion, were the strongest and most precise commitments yet from auto makers on air bags.    In the past, Ford has said only that it would &quot;in all likelihood&quot; install driver-side air bags &quot;in the majority of its North American-designed car production&quot; after Sept. 1, 1989, if the deadline were extended.    The deadline in question requires manufacturers to install automatic restraint systems -- either air bags or automatic seat belts -- on both the driver's and the passenger's side on all cars sold in the U.S. after Sept. 1, 1989.    But in November the Transportation Department, responding to a petition filed by Ford, proposed to delay requiring the full front-seat automatic restraint systems until model-year 1994. In the meantime, auto makers could install manual seat belts on the passenger side as long as they use air bags on the driver's side.    The department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration contended the change would provide added flexibility that would ultimately result in more air bags in cars.    During yesterday's hearing, Sen. Danforth initially harshly criticized the proposed change, saying it was just another gambit by the auto makers to delay installation of air bags. He also said if the rule were eased, there were no assurances that Ford actually would equip large numbers of cars with driver-side air bags by the 1990-model year.    But Ms. Petrauskas, under questioning, said the company expected the number of driver-side air bags for 1990 to be &quot;much closer to one million than 500,000 per year.&quot; Asked whether that represented a company commitment, she said, &quot;Yes.&quot;    Milford Bennett, assistant director of automotive safety engineering for General Motors Corp., said at the hearing that GM will offer a driver-side air bag as an option on its Oldsmobile Delta 88, beginning with the 1988-model year. Beyond that, he said, the Detroit-based company hasn't worked out &quot;firm plans&quot; regarding air bags. </TEXT></DOC>
