Background </ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 7, 1986 (51 FR 8180), FDA publisheda final regulation requiring the following labeling statement on oral andrectal OTC drug products containing aspirin: ``WARNING: Children and teenagersshould not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctoris consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illness.'' FDA tookthis action to aid in increasing the public's awareness of the associationbetween the use of aspirin and Reye syndrome \1\<NOTE/> and to bring uniformity and consistency to the labeling ofaspirin and aspirin-containing drug products in the marketplace. The 1986regulation was based, in large part, on the results of a ``pilot study''conducted by PHS which showed an association between the use of aspirinand the onset of Reye syndrome. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Reye syndrome is a rare but serious illness affectingchildren and teenagers. Characteristically, its onset follows illness dueto influenza B, influenza A, or chicken pox as the child or teenager appearsto be getting well. Reye syndrome is a degenerative disease of the brain;the symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and behavioral changes. The 1986 final rule also provided that the regulation would expire June6, 1988, 2 years from the effective date, unless the agency acted to extendit. This 2-year period was to allow for the completion and evaluation offurther research by PHS, known as the ``main study,'' into the associationbetween Reye syndrome and various exposure factors, including the use ofaspirin. 1. The PHS Main Study. The PHS main study confirmed the results of the pilot study and found alarge, statistically significant association between Reye syndrome in childrenand teenagers and the ingestion of aspirin during previous illnesses. ThePHS report, entitled ``Reye Syndrome and Medications_Report of the MainStudy,'' November 12, 1986, was prepared by the PHS Reye Syndrome TaskForce (Ref. 1). The PHS report was evaluated by the Institute of Medicine(IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences in a report entitled ``The PHSStudy of the Reye Syndrome: Review of a Continuing Study_Report Number6_Review of the PHS Continuing Study by the Committee on the Reye Syndromeand Medications,'' February 1987 (Ref. 2). A report of the main PHS studywas published in the <T3>Journal of the American Medical Association </T3>on April 10, 1987(Ref. 3). These reports have been placed on display with the Dockets ManagementBranch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, Rm. 4-62, 5600 FishersLane, Rockville, MD 20857, under Docket No. 87N-0371. Additional backgroundinformation may be found in Docket Nos. 82N-0158 and 85N-0553.The PHS main study concluded that the association between Reye syndromeand aspirin is consistent with estimates of risk determined in earlierstudies and reflects the strength of the epidemiologic association observedin those studies. The study reinforced the importance of reducing the useof aspirin in the treatment of children and teenagers with chicken poxand flu-like illnesses. FDA believes that the available evidence supportsthe continuing need to maintain a high level of public awareness of theassociation between the use of aspirin in children and teenagers with chickenpox and flu and the incidence of Reye syndrome.\2\<NOTE/> Accordingly, based on the results of this PHS research, inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>of January 22, 1988 (53 FR 1796), FDA publisheda proposed rule to make permanent the requirement regarding the Reye syndromewarning. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The preliminary results of another Reye syndrome study,conducted by Yale University, have been presented to FDA. These resultssupport the conclusion of the PHS study. The final report from the Yalestudy is expected within the next several months. 2. Public Education ProgramIn its efforts to create and maintain a high level of public awarenessof the association between the use of aspirin in children and teenagersand the incidence of Reye syndrome, FDA has conducted an extensive publiceducation program in addition to the required warning information on aspirinproduct labeling. FDA has initiated public educational activities on Reyesyndrome for several years, beginning in 1982. Earlier educational effortswere directed at raising the awareness of Reye syndrome among parents ofyoung children. More recently, FDA has focused its educational programtowards teenagers who may still be unaware of the association between Reyesyndrome and aspirin use for their age group during the flu or chickenpox. Accordingly, during 1987, the agency distributed approximately 40,000posters to high schools and colleges warning of the association betweenReye syndrome and the ingestion of aspirin during illness with the fluor chicken pox. In addition, FDA distributed public service announcementsto approximately 2,000 radio stations, and sent advertisements to approximately11,000 daily and weekly newspapers across the United States, with the messageconsistently directed toward teenagers. The aspirin industry, through the Aspirin Foundation of America, has alsoconducted an extensive public education program during the past severalyears. Public service announcements were distributed to television andradio stations around the country, as well as the major networks, beginningin the spring of 1985 and continuing in each of the succeeding three fluseasons. As with the FDA efforts, recent educational initiatives have soughtto reach teenage audiences, by featuring teenage television and radio personalitiesin public service announcements. Several retail grocery and pharmacy storesand chains have also participated in a number of educational efforts regardingReye syndrome. 3. Decline in Incidence of Reye Syndrome The Centers for Disease Control has reported that the number of cases ofReye syndrome has declined significantly between 1980 (658 cases) and 1985(93 cases). Moreover, according to a study published in <T3>Pediatrics </T3>in June 1987 (``National Patterns of Aspirin Use andReye Syndrome Reporting, United States, 1980 to 1985'') (Ref. 4), pediatricaspirin use during that same time also declined. These favorable trendsappear to be continuing, with 101 Reye syndrome cases reported for 1986in the <T3>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report </T3>(Ref. 5). Although the datashow a decline in Reye syndrome cases over the past few years, the factthat 101 cases were reported as recently as 1986 indicates the continuingneed for a clear and uniform Reye syndrome warning on aspirin-containingdrug products and for a continued public education program. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Highlights of the Final Rule </ITAG>As described further below, all the comments received on the proposed ruleexpressed support for continuing the Reye syndrome warning requirement.The final rule, therefore, makes permanent the requirement that all orallyand rectally administered OTC aspirin products bear an appropriate Reyesyndrome warning. The final regulation revises the warning statement to make clear that aspirinuse in children and teenagers has been reported to be associated with Reyesyndrome. Specifically, the final regulation amends the previous warningby adding the phrase ``reported to be associated with aspirin'' at theend, so that the new Reye syndrome warning reads as follows: ``WARNING:Children and teenagers should not use this medicine for chicken pox orflu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare butserious illness <T3>reported to be associated with aspirin.</T3>'' FDA believes the revisionis appropriate and necessary to reflect the PHS study finding of a large,statistically significant association between Reye syndrome and the ingestionof aspirin during chicken pox or flu. As with the 1986 regulation, thisrevised warning, once fully implemented, will provide consumers with aclear and consistent message and will continue to ensure consistency anduniformity in the marketplace. The final rule also continues the requirement in the 1986 regulation thatthe Reye syndrome warning be ``prominent.'' Such prominence is achieved,in part, by the regulation's continuing requirement that the Reye syndromewarning be the first warning on the label under the ``WARNINGS'' heading.In addition, in order to call consumers' attention to the revised wordingof the Reye syndrome warning, FDA is interpreting the requirement for prominenceas requiring, for a period of 1 year, an attention-getting statement onthe principal display panel of the product.Finally, the revised warning is required to appear on affected productpackages that are initially introduced or initially delivered for introductioninto interstate commerce by December 9, 1988. Until the effective dateof the revised Reye syndrome warning, the current Reye syndrome warningrequirement remains in effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comments  </ITAG>The proposal provided 60 days for public comment. FDA received 17 commentson the proposed rule. The comments were submitted by drug companies, pharmaceuticaltrade associations, consumer groups, professional medical associations,congressional representatives, individual health practitioners, and groupsrepresenting the interests of victims of Reye syndrome. All comments generallysupported a continued requirement for a Reye syndrome warning. A summaryof the comments received by FDA during the comment period and the agency'sresponse to them follows:1. Text of Warning StatementSeveral comments expressed concern about the precise language of the warningstatement. The major concern raised was that the warning should be revisedto make clear the concept of an association between Reye syndrome and aspirinuse. One comment also recommended that the warning's reference to ``chickenpox or flu symptoms'' be removed, contending that reports of Reye syndromeassociated with aspirin use have not been limited to patients sufferingfrom varicella or influenza. Another comment urged that the warning notethe potential fatal consequences of Reye syndrome. This comment arguedthat individuals do not always appreciate the seriousness of a warningunless it discloses the consequences that can result if the warning isnot heeded.  FDA agrees with the suggestion that the warning statement should be revisedto make clear that aspirin use in children has been reported to be associatedwith Reye syndrome. Now that the PHS study has been completed and has reporteda large, statistically significant association between Reye syndrome andaspirin use, FDA believes it is appropriate and necessary that the warningstatement indicate this association. Accordingly, the warning statementhas been revised to read: ``WARNING: Children and teenagers should notuse this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctor is consultedabout Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illness reported to be associatedwith aspirin.''  FDA does not believe that the other issues raised by the comments warrantchanges in the final rule. FDA believes it appropriate at this time thatthe warning continue to refer to ``chicken pox and flu symptoms'' becausethese symptoms were the symptoms of most of the antecedent illnesses inthe PHS study on which FDA is relying as the scientific justification forthe warning requirement. In addition, FDA believes that the warning's referenceto Reye syndrome as a ``serious illness'' is sufficient for consumers toappreciate the medical importance of the warning statement. Accordingly,based on the data available at this time, FDA does not believe that furtherchanges to the warning statement in the final rule are now necessary.2. Prominence of Required Warning  Several comments suggested that the required Reye syndrome warning be givenmore prominence on aspirin drug product labeling. Comments variously urgedthat the warning statement be made conspicuous through large type sizeor be set off by use of a contrasting color. One comment recommended thatthe entire warning statement be boxed.  FDA agrees that it is essential to bring the Reye syndrome warning to theattention of the consumer. In order to achieve this, the final rule continuesthe requirement in the current regulation that the Reye syndrome warningappear ``prominently'' on the label. This includes the requirements thatthe Reye syndrome warning appear as the first warning on all labeling ofaspirin drug products under the heading ``Warnings''; that the warningmust appear on the immediate container label and on the retail package;and that the warning must appear on all product labeling that containswarnings. These provisions thus help assure that the warning statementwill be seen and read by the consumer.  In addition, because the text of the Reye syndrome warning is being revised,FDA interprets the ``prominence'' requirement in the regulations (21 CFR201.15 and 201.315(h)(1)), in the unique circumstances presented here,as requiring that the principal display panel call consumers' attentionto the new warning. Specifically, FDA interprets this as requiring manufacturersof aspirin and aspirin-containing drug products to provide an attention-gettingstatement, such as a ``flag,'' alerting consumers to the revised Reye syndromewarning. A phrase using the words ``new'' and ``warning,'' such as oneof the following phrases, should be used: (1) ``See new warning for children/teens'';(2) ``Read new label warning''; or (3) ``Read new warning for children/teens.''To assure that consumers are alerted to the new warning, the language ofthe attention-getting statement must: (i) Appear on the principal displaypanel; (ii) be carried in type size which is conspicuous; and (iii) becarried for 1 year after the revised Reye syndrome warning statement isadded to the labeling. For that 1-year period, FDA will view as misbrandedany aspirin or aspirin-containing OTC drug product whose principal displaypanel fails to contain an appropriate attention-getting statement.  FDA is not prescribing a minimum type size or use of contrasting colorfor the warning. However, under section 502(c) of the Federal Food, Drug,and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 352(c)), a drug is misbranded ifa required labeling statement is not sufficiently prominent to render itlikely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customaryconditions of purchase and use. Agency regulations state that a labelingstatement may lack the prominence and conspicuousness required by section502(c) of the act by reason, among others, of ``[s]mallness or style oftype in which such * * * statement * * * appears, insufficient backgroundcontrast, obscuring designs or vignettes, or crowding with other written,printed, or graphic matter.'' (21 CFR 201.15(a)(6).) In its surveillanceof OTC drug products FDA routinely examines the warning statements on aspirinproducts to be sure that these requirements regarding prominence and conspicuousnessof the warning statements have been met.3. Australian Study  One comment said the proposed warning statement is acceptable as currentlyworded and advised against changing the language to make it more stringent.The comment was reacting to a letter referenced in the proposal which advocateda stronger warning statement. The comment contended that the associationbetween Reye syndrome and aspirin is not supported by all studies. Specifically,the comment referred to an Australian study that found no correlation betweenthe use of aspirin and the occurrence of Reye syndrome. The comment concludedthat the current warning statement is sufficient in light of the lack ofcomplete agreement among the studies.  FDA does not find the results of the Australian study cited by the commentto be persuasive. The Australian study, reported in <T3>Pediatrics </T3>(Ref. 6), is a retrospective review of medical recordsof patients hospitalized during a 10-year period between 1973 and 1982.Unlike the PHS study, the Australian study was not controlled. Moreover,medication histories for the period before hospitalization were based onchart reviews, a less reliable method of gathering data than that followedin the PHS study. The reported cases in the Australian study were predominantlyin a very young age group, in which metabolic errors may be indistinguishablefrom Reye syndrome. Therefore, the identification of cases as Reye syndromecases in the Australian study is questionable. The approach of applyingnew criteria to a review of older medical records is certainly not as reliableas the rigorous approach prospectively developed and applied in the PHSstudies. The agency continues to believe that the evidence from researchto date clearly indicates a strong association between Reye syndrome andthe ingestion of aspirin.4. Adult-only Aspirin  One comment suggested that FDA permit labeling for aspirin-containing drugproducts that are not intended for use by children or teenagers to bearthis special warning statement: ``Warning: This medicine is not for childrenor teenagers. Children and teenagers should not use this medicine becauseof concerns about Reye Syndrome, a rare but serious illness.''  FDA does not agree with this suggestion. As stated more fully in the proposalof December 17, 1985 (50 FR 51400), FDA believes that the public interestis best served by assuring that the same warning statement is used on allproducts covered by the regulation. This approach eliminates the potentialfor consumers being confused by various forms of the warning statement.5. Other Salicylates  Another comment recommended that the labeling warning statement be requirednot only for aspirin and aspirin-containing drug products, but for allproducts containing salicylates.  FDA notes that the scientific research to date, on which the Reye syndromewarning statement requirement is based, focuses on the association betweenReye syndrome and aspirin, rather than on the broader category of drugproducts containing nonaspirin salicylates. Indeed, the PHS study reportedthat there were too few subjects with reported exposures to nonaspirinsalicylates for a meaningful analysis. FDA believes at the present timethat priority must be given to continuing the warning on aspirin and aspirin-containingproducts. FDA will consider extending the scope of the warning requirementto nonaspirin salicylates at some time in the future, if warranted by furtherresearch or other appropriate information.6. Changing the Marketing Status of Certain Aspirin Products  Several comments suggested that FDA require that aspirin be removed asan ingredient from compounds that may be used by individuals under 21 yearsof age. Another comment proposed that aspirin be available for childrenand adolescents only under a physician's prescription.  FDA believes that continuing to require a Reye syndrome warning statementon aspirin and aspirin-containing OTC drug products is sufficient and thatthe more drastic measures of banning use of aspirin in products for individualsunder 21 years of age or limiting such products to prescription use areunnecessary. As noted, the latest epidemiological data indicate a markeddecline in the incidence of Reye syndrome among children and adolescentssince 1980. FDA does not believe that removing aspirin from compounds usedby individuals under 21 years of age would be justifiable because otheraspirin-containing compounds would still be readily available for administrationto children and teenagers. Moreover, the agency believes that OTC aspirin-containingproducts properly labeled with the Reye syndrome warning statement canbe safely used in the proper circumstances by individuals under 21 yearsof age. Therefore, FDA disagrees with the suggestion that aspirin for individualsunder 21 years of age be made available only under a physician's prescription.7. Labeling in Spanish  Two comments suggested that the current warning statement would be moreeffective if it were also required to be in Spanish.  Under FDA labeling regulations (21 CFR 201.15(c)), labeling may be writtenin the predominant local language when it is distributed solely in theCommonwealth of Puerto Rico or in a Territory where the predominant languageis one other than English. Although in the 50 states all required labelingmust appear in English, the regulations do not preclude the distributionof labeling in a language other than English, in a special format, or inBraille along with the conventional English language labeling. FDA encouragesthe preparation of labeling to meet the needs of non-English speaking orspecial user populations so long as such labeling fully complies with agencyregulations.Effective Dates  The agency believes it is of the utmost importance that there be no timegap in the requirement for a Reye syndrome warning statement on aspirinand aspirin-containing drug products. The available evidence supports thecontinuing need to maintain a high level of public awareness of the risksof use of aspirin in children and teenagers. In addition, no additionalcosts associated with labeling changes would result from this action, sinceit would simply require the continued use of labeling already prepared.Because of the importance to the public health of assuring that the labelingof all oral and rectal OTC aspirin products bears a Reye syndrome warning,the Commissioner finds good cause for making effective immediately thatpart of this final rule which makes a Reye syndrome warning statement apermanent requirement. Accordingly, andSection; 201.314 is revised by deletingparagraph (h)(5) effective June 9, 1988.  This final rule also amends the warning statement to read: ``WARNING: Childrenand teenagers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptomsbefore a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illnessreported to be associated with aspirin.'' To provide aspirin drug productmanufacturers with adequate lead time to make the necessary printing changes,this provision is effective December 9, 1988. After December 9, 1988, anyorally or rectally administered aspirin or aspirin-containing product thatdoes not contain the revised warning statement and that is initially introducedor initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce is misbrandedunder sections 201(n) and 502 (a) and (f) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)and 352 (a) and (f)). As noted earlier, until the effective date of therevised Reye syndrome warning, the current Reye syndrome warning requirementremains in effect.Also as noted in the response to comment number 2 above, after December9, 1988, FDA will view as misbranded under section 502 of the act any aspirindrug product subject to this regulation that is initially introduced orinitially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce and thatdoes not contain an appropriate attention-getting statement on the principaldisplay panel. To assure that consumers are alerted to the new warningstatement for at least the equivalent of a single flu season, the attention-gettingstatement is to be carried on the principal display panel of each productsubject to this regulation that is initially introduced or initially deliveredfor introduction into interstate commerce until December 11, 1989. FDA believes that a 6-month effective date for the revised warning statementgives manufacturers sufficient time to make the required labeling changes.FDA recognizes, however, that there may be a few small manufacturers forwhom, for various financial or other reasons, it is impossible to complywith the revised labeling provision of this final rule by the effectivedate. In these unusual circumstances, FDA will consider requests for limitedextensions. Such requests should be sent to Office of Compliance, Centerfor Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-300), Food and Drug Administration,5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, and should document both the needfor a extension and the duration of time requested. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Economic Impact </ITAG>FDA has examined the regulatory impact and regulatory flexibility implicationsof the final rule in accordance with Executive Order 12291 and the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. This regulation requires manufacturers to incur costsfor making one-time typesetting changes to the Reye syndrome warning statementin the product label. The warning statement appears on the immediate containerlabel and, in those cases where the immediate container is not the retailpackage, also on the retail package label. In addition, the warning statementmust appear on any labeling that contains warnings. Therefore, this actionmay require one-time typesetting changes for as many as three labels perproduct. In addition, this regulation requires manufacturers to incur costs formaking one-time typesetting changes to the principal display panel on aproduct's label to include an attention-getting statement or flag bringingto the consumer's attention the warning statement. Any costs incurred by manufacturers as a result of discarding outdatedlabel inventories would be negligible because the regulation gives 6 monthsof update labels before products are initially introduced or initiallydelivered for introduction into interstate commerce. FDA estimates that the regulation will impose direct one-time costs associatedwith changing product labels that total less than $6 million. Therefore,the agency has determined that the final rule is not a major rule as definedin Executive Order 12291. Further, FDA certifies that the final rule willnot have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Environmental Impact </ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">V.
