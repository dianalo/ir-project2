Sibghatullah Mojaddidi also asked foreign countries to recognizethe proposed government, which hopes to take over if theSoviet-backed government in Kabul is overthrown.   Other resistance leaders rejected the government elected by a440-member group of Moslem guerrillas in Pakistan on Thursday.   At a news conference concluding the stormy three-week session,Mojaddidi said it would become functional inside Afghanistan withina month, but he did not elaborate.   Mojaddidi, leader of the guerrilla Afghan National LiberationFront, also requested the United Nations give the interim governmenta seat in the General Assembly.   However, Mohammad Saljooque, a delegate and member of theNational Islamic Front of Afghanistan, said ``the whole thing(assembly) was contrived'' to leave power in the hands of aseven-party Islamic guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan.   Eight Afghan guerrilla groups based in Iran boycotted the meetingin a dispute with the Pakistan-based majority over allocation ofseats.   ``We consider the formation of the interim government asone-sided, and we cannot recognize it,'' the leader of theIran-based rebel alliance, Mohammad Karim Khalili, was quoted assaying Friday by Tehran Radio.   The guerrillas have been fighting Afghanistan's Soviet-backedgovernment since it seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. Sovietforces intervened in December 1979 and completed a nine-monthwithdrawal Feb. 15.   The guerrilla council, known as a shura, met at a religious campoutside Islamabad to form a broad-based interim government thatwould oversee a return to peace and the formation of an Islamicgovernment.   Once the shura convened on Feb. 10, the seven Pakistan-basedparties quarreled over distribution of Cabinet ministries.   The four fundamentalist groups favor a strict Moslem governmentwhile the moderates advocate a more liberal regime with Islam as theofficial religion.   On Thursday, the shura approved a government that gives each ofthe seven leaders a key post, and reserves most remaining portfoliosfor their own parties.   Mojaddidi on Friday repeated the guerrillas' offer of amnesty todefecting Afghan communists.   ``There is a general amnesty for (Kabul) regime members with theblood of mujahedeen on their hands'' if they join the resistance,Mojaddidi said through an interpreter.   A Western diplomatic source in Islamabad said the rebels'announcement of a Cabinet might not be enough for the world toaccept it as a new, legitimate government.   ``I think it's too early to talk about recognition. Their firsttest will be to get a capital,'' the source said, speaking oncondition he not be identified.   Communist forces, heavily armed by the departing Red Army, holdKabul and Afghanistan's key cities. The insurgents, backed mainly byPakistan and the United States, reportedly control about 90 percentof the countryside.   Guerrilla and Western observers have predicted Kabul will fallwithin weeks or months in the absence of Soviet forces but MarxistPresident Najib says his army is strong enough to withstand a rebelonslaught.   Resistance leaders say they are adopting a harrassment and siegetactic to save lives and await the communists' collapse from within.   Of Afghanistan's pre-war population of 15 million, more than 1million people have died and more than 5 million Afghans live asrefugees in Pakistan and Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
