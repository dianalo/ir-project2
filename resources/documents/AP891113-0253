On the 40th day of the walkout, Paul Binder of Boeing saidcompany officials had not decided whether they would be willing toresume negotiations with the Machinists union in the absence of avote.   ``We haven't taken any kind of position on that,'' he said.``What we would like to do is to encourage a membership vote.''   Federal mediator Doug Hammond, who has reconvened the bargainingteams twice without success since the strike began Oct. 4, said hedidn't know when he might make a third attempt.   Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751, saidthere was still time to reach a settlement before Thanksgiving.   ``I just hope that something will break here,'' Baker said.``I'd hope that they won't force the membership to go through anyholidays, Thanksgiving and so on.''   The union represents about 57,800 Boeing workers, including43,300 in the local district lodge; 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700in Portland, Ore.; and a few hundred at scattered sites inCalifornia, Hawaii, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota and otherstates.   The latest talks ended Nov. 4 after six days, with Boeingoffering a 3-year contract calling for wage increases of 4 percent,3 percent and 3 percent; annual bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay,4 percent and 4 percent; a reduction in mandatory overtime from thecurrent 200 hours a quarter to 144 hours by mid-1990, andacross-the-board increases in retirement benefits.   Machinist union leaders rejected the offer, saying it providedno more money than the one spurned in an 85 percent strike vote onOct. 3.   Reiterating that there would be no increase in the moneypackage, Boeing officials have issued public statements, taken outfull-page newspaper ads and mailed letters to the strikers' homesin a campaign for a vote on the offer.   Binder said that in ``close to 2,000 calls'' to a companyinformation phone line over the past week, most of those expressingan opinion said they favored a vote.   Baker said Boeing's campaign actually boosted support for unionnegotiators after widespread disappointment following the collapsein talks.   He said the number of hourly workers crossing picket lines inrecent days was less than 2 percent in the Puget Sound area,compared with less than 1 percent early in the strike.   ``It's just as effective now as it was on Nov. 4,'' Baker said.   Binder said an average of more than 10 percent are crossingpicket lines, ranging from 5 percent in the Puget Sound area, whereunion membership is mandatory, to 35 percent to 36 percent inWichita, where union membership is voluntary under state law.   That compares with company figures last week of 10 percentoverall, 4 percent in the Puget Sound area and 34 percent inWichita.   Even if the company figures are accurate, Baker said, ``it's notenough to make any difference. They can't build any airplanes.''   Spokesman Tom Cole of Boeing's Commercial Airplanes divisionsaid one 737-300 was delivered Friday to United Airlines andanother a day earlier to Southwest Airlines, bringing totaldeliveries to 19 planes since the strike began.   Another Boeing spokesman, Jack Gamble, said another 18 or soplanes also were virtually completed before the strike and probablycould be delivered without the strikers.   On the production line, however, work has ground to a halt.   Baker said the strike probably would run past Saturday, the 45thday, exceeding the length of the last Boeing walkout in 1977 andbecoming the longest work stoppage at the world's largestcommercial airplane builder since a 4{-month strike in 1948.</TEXT></DOC>
