Despite widespread negative sentiment toward the U.S. currency, the intimidating presence of major central banks joining in support of the dollar has frozen the market in its tracks for the time being, traders said.    &quot;They've put their heart into this one,&quot; said Charles A. Luma, a trader at Industrial Bank of Japan's New York branch, referring to this week's central-bank intervention. &quot;They've said exactly what they want and people don't want to fight them because they'll lose,&quot; he said.    Added Robert Hatcher, a foreign exchange vice president at Barclays Bank International Ltd. in New York: &quot;The market was very well behaved.&quot;    Last month the Group of Six -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada -- agreed in Paris to coordinate actions to control sharp exchange-rate swings. As the dollar fell below the 150 Japanese yen-level Tuesday, the Bank of Japan launched a large intervention program to prop the dollar's value. Later the U.S., West German, and British central banks joined the effort. Yesterday the Bank of France intervened along with the Bank of Japan to buy dollars against the yen.    The Group of Six, or G-6, central banks purchased about $6 billion with yen this week, estimated Mr. Luma, who is also a vice president of foreign exchange at Industrial Bank of Japan.    &quot;If they continue to spend the money that they've spent in the past few days, they can stop&quot; the dollar's decline, he said. &quot;The significance is that they are constantly around at levels below 150 (yen) buying dollars.&quot;    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 149.50 yen, up fractionally from 149.35 Wednesday. The dollar edged lower against the West German unit, to 1.8305 marks from 1.8309.    In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar fell to about 149.38 yen from 149.50 in New York yesterday afternoon.    Although market participants generally believe that the dollar eventually will resume its decline, many dealers said the market could remain stable as long as the G-6 central banks continue their united support.    &quot;We've had a who's who of central banks propping up the dollar against the yen,&quot; Mr. Hatcher said. They've given the impression that the Group of Six is very much alive,&quot; he said.    Observed Ronald L. Sapiro, vice president and chief dealer at Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. in Chicago: &quot;This could last indefinitely.&quot;    Traders' bearishness toward the dollar is rooted in the continuing problems of the U.S. trade and budget deficits and the potential harm to the American banking system posed by the Third World debt crisis.    &quot;I'm dying to sell dollars, Mr. Sapiro said. &quot;The only thing holding the dollar up is the G-6 agreement.&quot;.    The Bank of France's intervention in dollar-yen trading, although modest, took many market players by surprise. European central banks normally don't intervene in currencies other than their own, and the French central bank has a lower posture in the market.    &quot;Maybe tomorrow we'll see the Bank of Canada come in,&quot; Mr. Sapiro said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Thursday, gold for March delivery fell $1.50 an ounce to $411.50 in moderate trading estimated at 3.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $411.65 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Thursday, March 26, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
