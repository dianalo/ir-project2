Some researchers have noted considerable morphological overlapwith other taxa. However, recent studies (Bliss 1983, Minc 1989) of floralcharacters of closely related taxa showed distinct morphometric differencesbetween <T3>M. glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis, M. glabratus</T3> var. <T3>fremontii</T3> and <T3>M. guttatus</T3>. Statistical analyses of measurements of corolla length,corolla width, pistil length, style length, and ovary length demonstratedthat <T3>M. glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> is consistently and distinctively intermediate betweenthe other two taxa: smaller than <T3>M. guttatus</T3>, but larger than <T3>M. glabratus</T3> var. <T3>fremontii.</T3> As Minc (1989) reports, the two <T3>M. glabratus </T3>varieties are readily distinguished by differencesin flower size, while some size overlap occurs between <T3>M. glabratus</T3> var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> and <T3>M. guttatus. </T3>However, the latter two taxa differ in the shapeof the floral characters. These studies confirmed the validity of recognizingthis taxon at least as a distinct variety and perhaps as a separate species.<T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> is an aquatic or semi-aquatic glabrous, perennialherb with lax stems averaging 36 centimeters (14 inches) in length. Itroots at the lower stem nodes to produce clones of up to several hundredstems. The rotund, coarsely-toothed leaves are opposite and evenly distributedalong the stem. The plant blooms from about mid-June to mid-July and occasionallyto mid-August. However, pollen viability is low, suggesting that var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> is primarily dependent on vegetative reproduction.The yellow tubular flowers range from 16 to 27 millimeters (.63 to 1.1inches) long (Bliss 1983, Minc 1989) and emerge from upper leaf axils onslender stalks. The flowers have two-lobed upper lips and three-lobed lowerlips, with the lower lip and tube irregularly red spotted. The ranges ofvar. <T3>michiganensis</T3> and var. <T3>fremontii</T3> overlap, though these plants have not been found toco-occur at any site. <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> can be distinguished from var. <T3>fremontii</T3> by flower size. The smaller var. <T3>fremontii</T3> flowers are 8 to 18 millimeters (.32 to .71 inches)long. Pistil length is 11 to 21 millimeters (.43 to .83 inches) for var.<T3>michiganensis, and 5 to 10 millimeters (.2 to .39 inches) for var.</T3><T3>fremontii</T3>. Although their ranges are not presently known to overlap,<T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> is generally smaller than <T3>M. guttatus </T3>and can be distinguished from this taxon by the largeropening in the corolla throat and the shape of the calyx lobes Crispin and Penskar (1989) report that var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> is narrowly restricted to cold, saturated soilsof seepages on forest edges and in small openings located along streamsand lakeshores. Nearly all known populations are associated with the current,or what were the ancient, shorelines of the Great Lakes. Northern whitecedar (<T3>Thuja occidentalis</T3>) is usually dominant in the overstory. TheMichigan monkey-flower grows in muck or mucky sand that is saturated orinundated by cold, flowing spring water. Typical associates include <T3>Impatiens biflora </T3>(touch-me-not), <T3>Myosotis scorpioides </T3>(forget-me-not), <T3>Nasturtium officinale </T3>(watercress), <T3>Mentha arvensis (spearmint), and </T3><T3>Conocephalum conicum </T3>(liverwort). Other species frequently presentare <T3>Caltha palustris </T3>(buttercup), <T3>Mitella nuda </T3>(miterwort), <T3>Cystopteris bulbifera </T3>(bulblet fern), <T3>Eupatorium maculatum </T3>(joe-pye-weed), <T3>Equisetum arvensis </T3>(scouring-rush), and <T3>Thuidium delicatulum </T3>(feather moss).Many of the earliest herbarium specimens of <T3>Mimulus glabratus</T3> var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> were not initially identified beyond the specieslevel. They were subsequently identified as var. <T3>jamesii,</T3> var. <T3>fremontii,</T3> and finally var. <T3>michiganensis.</T3> The first reported collection of var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> was by Charles F. Wheeler in Harbor Springs, EmmetCounty, Michigan in July 1890. However. the specimen was not identifiedas var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> until 1980. The type specimen was collected in July1925 by J. H. Ehlers along the banks of Niger Creek near Topinabee, CheboyganCounty, Michigan Whereas the <T3>Mimulus glabratus</T3> complex ranges from Canada to southern Chile,historical records and recent surveys have shown that var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> has a very narrow range, restricted to the MackinacStraits and Grand Traverse regions of Michigan, specifically in Benzie,Cheboygan, Emmet, Leelanau and Mackinac Counties. The plant is no longerextant at four of the 16 known historical locations (including the typelocality and the site of first collection). Two existing sites containonly one or two plants. Almost two-thirds of the extant occurrences areon privately-owned lands. The var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> also occurs at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore,the University of Michigan Biological Station, a county park, a townshippark, and on land owned by the Michigan Nature Association, a private state-wideconservation organization. Federal Government action on this plant began as a result of Section 12of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531<T3>et seq.</T3>) which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institutionto prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened,or extinct. This report (Ayensu and DeFillipps 1978), designated as HouseDocument No. 94-51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var.<T3> michiganensis</T3> was listed as ``threatened'' in that document.On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonianreport as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) of the Act (nowsection 4(b)(3)) and of its intention to review the status of plant taxanamed within. On June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700vascular plant species to be endangered species pursuant to section 4 ofthe Act. The list of 1,700 plant taxa was assembled on the basis of commentsand data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in responseto House Document No 94-51 and the July 1, 1975, <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication. <T3>Mimulus glabratus</T3> var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> was included in the July 1, 1975, notice of reviewand the June 16, 1976, proposal. General comments received in relationto the 1976 proposal were summarized in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 26, 1978 (43 FR 17909). On December10, 1979, the Service published a notice (44 FR 70796) withdrawing theportion of the June 16, 1976 proposal that had not been made final, alongwith four other proposals that had expired due to a procedural requirementof the 1978 Amendments to the Act. On December 15, 1980 (45 FR 82479),November 28, 1983 (48 FR 53640), and September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525),the Service published revised notices of review for native plants in the<T4>Federal Register.</T4> <T3>Mimulus glabratus</T3> var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> was included as a category 1 species in the 1980notice. Category 1 species are those for which biological information intha Service's possession warrants their listing as endangered or threatened.In the 1983 and 1985 notices. var. <T3>michiganensis</T3> was dropped to category 2 when it became evidentthat further biological research and surveys were needed to determine itsstatus and taxonomic validity. Since that time, additional research (Minc1989) and an updated status survey (Crispin and Penskar 1989) were completed,which clarified the taxonomic distinctness of the plant and demonstratedmore clearly the biological threat and the need for protection under theAct.The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982 required that all petitionspending as of October 13, 1982, be treated as having been submitted onthat date. The deadline for a finding on those species, including <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis, </T3>was October 13, 1983. On October 13, 1983, andagain in 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988, the petition finding was thatlisting of <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>was warranted pending finding of further informationbut precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act Such a finding requires that the petition berecycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The present proposalconstitutes the final finding that the listing is warranted. The Serviceproposes to implement the petitioned action in accordance with section4(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act and regulations promulgatedto implement the listing provisions of the Act (50 CFR part 424) set forththe procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may bedetermined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or moreof the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and theirapplication to <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>(Pennell) Fassett (Michigan monkey-flower) are asfollows: A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>is restricted to the current and what was the historicalGreat Lakes shorelines in the Mackinac Straits and Grand Traverse regionsin Michigan. These areas are rapidly being developed for recreational andresidential purposes. The major threat to var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>is the destruction and adverse modification of itshabitat. Since most populations lie along lakeshores and streams, the plantis particularly vulnerable to increasing vacation home development in itsrange (Crispin and Penskar 1989). Of the 16 extant and historical populations,three have been extirpated and at least two additional sites have beenseverely impacted by residential and other developments. The plant hasbeen extirpated at an additional site (the type locality) due to unknowncauses. <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>appears to be highly dependent on continuous suppliesof cold spring water. Two of the smaller populations have survived artificialdisturbances, such as overstory thinning, and cutting and pulling in spring-fedrivulets that have been maintained adjacent to lakeside residences. Therefore,the plant may be impacted by both direct destruction of its habitat aswell as by disturbance to its water supply. Upstream water supply may beimpacted by roads and other activities which divert water from the smalldrainages which support the plant. Excessive pumping of groundwater upgradientof the sites may reduce stream baseflows. The plant may therefore be inadvertentlyimpacted by offsite activities. One recent extirpation of a populationappears to have been due to such a disturbance to its water supply. B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>Commercial trade of this plant is not known to exist, butcollection could reduce populations in more accessible sites. Some incidentalcommercial use has occurred. One population was discovered after a botanistwas served a sprig of <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>as a garnish on his restaurant dinner plate. C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>None known that affects this taxon D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. Mimulus glabratus</T3>var <T3>michiganensis </T3>is listed as threatened by the State of Michigan.It is illegal to take, possess, transport, import, export, process, sell,buy, collect, pick, cut, dig up, or destroy in any manner any listed plantsor plant parts, without a permit Although the State Endangered SpeciesAct does not provide protection for habitat, State and Federal wetlandlaws regulate many activities within the streamside/wetland habitat of<T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis</T3>. However, there is no guarantee for preservationof this habitat nor the plant's water supply without the protection ofthe Act and subsequent recovery actions including development of specificmanagement plans. The Endangered Species Act offers possibility for additionalprotection of this taxon through section 6 cooperation between the Statesand the Service, and through section 7 (interagency cooperation) requirements.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>Periodic high water levels of the Great Lakes impact the shorelinehabitat of <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis. </T3>Recent record high water levels and strong winterstorms reshaped many shoreline areas, redirecting seepage streams whichsupported the plants and opening the overstory by felling cedars. At leastone site occurrence listed as extant has not been resurveyed since thesestorms. Therefore, its present status is unknown. Other shoreline coloniesappear to have survived the recent high water levels.<T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>is particularly vulnerable because of the low numbersof individuals occurring at most sites and its limited capability for sexualreproduction. Since the plant roots at the lower stem nodes to producenew stems, it is impossible to distinguish the number of genetic individualsin each colony. However, if one assumes that each ``clump'' of stems isone individual plant, only four of 12 extant sites contain more than 10plants. In addition, if, as Crispin and Penskar (1989) surmise, the largelyclonal colonies have low genetic diversity, <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>may have limited ability to survive or adapt toenvironmental change. With the limited number of colonies and individualsin existence, and the limited gene pool, the loss of any individuals wouldappreciably reduce the chances of survival and recovery. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>as endangered. Endangered status appears to be appropriatedue to the restricted range of this taxon, the limited number of populationsand individuals, its limited capability for sexual reproduction and henceits limited gene pool, and the severity of threats facing the species.Critical habitat is not being proposed for reasons listed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at thetime the species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent forthis species. The limited number of populations and individuals of <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>make this plant particularly vulnerable to taking,an activity difficult to enforce against and only regulated by the Actwith respect to plants in cases of (1) removal and reduction to possessionof listed plants from lands under Federal jurisdiction, or their maliciousdamage or destruction on such lands; and (2) removal, cutting, diggingup, or damaging or destroying in knowing violation of any State law orregulation, including State criminal trespass law. Such provisions aredifficult to enforce, and publication of critical habitat descriptionsand maps would make <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>more vulnerable and increase enforcement problems.The principal landowners have been notified of the location and importanceof protecting this species' habitat. Protection of this species' habitatwill be addressed through the recovery process and through the Section7 jeopardy standard. Therefore, it would not now be prudent to determinecritical habitat for <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis. </T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part,below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect alisted species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service. The National ParkService has jurisdiction over one <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>site in Leelanau County, Michigan. Currently, noactivities to be permitted, funded, or carried out by any Federal agency,are known to exist which would affect this taxon. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. All trade prohibitions of Section9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions,in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction ofthe United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for salethis species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduceto possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. In addition,for listed plants, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibitthe malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands, and the removal,cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying of listed plants in knowingviolation of any State law or regulation, including State criminal trespasslaw. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservationagencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuanceof permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangeredspecies under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits would ever be sought or issuedbecause <T3>Mimulus glabratus </T3>var. <T3>michiganensis </T3>is not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requestsfor copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them maybe addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and WildlifeService. P.O. Box 3507, Arlington, VA 22203 (703/358-2093).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, comments orsuggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, thescientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningthis proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly are soughtconcerning: (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species; (2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and populationsize of this species; (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species. Final promulgation of the regulation(s) on this species will take intoconsideration the comments and any additional information received by theService, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be received within 45 days of the date of publicationof the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed toRegional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Federal Building, FortSnelling, Twin Cities, Minnesota 55111. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto Section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). <ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Ayensu, R.E., and R.A.
