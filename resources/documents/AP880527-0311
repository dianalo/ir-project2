(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A computer whiz has pleaded guilty toconspiring to sell $4 million in stolen supercomputer technology tothe Soviet Union.   Kevin Anderson of Fremont admitted in federal court on Thursdayhe took part in a scheme with three other people to sell theSoviets plans to a system that allows computers to process as manyas 1 billion instructions per second.   The technology had a restricted rather than classified statusbut could have proved damaging to U.S. security if the Soviets hadreceived it, according to the government.   The deal was broken up by government agents who infiltrated thescheme, U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said when arrests weremade last year.   Anderson pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate export laws andwire fraud, based on his use of the telephone to defraud SaxpyComputer Corp. of Sunnyvale, from which the plans were stolen.   In exchange, prosecutors dropped about a dozen other chargesagainst the former software engineer at Synthesized ComputerSystems Inc. in Santa Clara.   Anderson faces up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to$20.3 million at sentencing July 15.   The plea came two weeks before an extradition hearing in Canadafor Charles McVey, an alleged conspirator in the scheme. He isbeing held in Vancouver, British Columbia.   Ivan-Pierre Batinic, an engineer who once worked fr Saxpy, andhis brother Stevan also were charged in the case.   According to court documents, Anderson had planned to use anelaborate money-laundering scheme involving Liechtenstein banks toset up a computer business in Dublin, Ireland, after completing thesale to the Soviets.</TEXT></DOC>
