Troops and civilian commandos backed by tanks broke back into thebase a few hours after the seizure and opened fire from two smalltanks at the officers' club, in which the commandos were thought tobe holed up, the state news agency Telam reported. There were noimmediate reports of casualties in the counterattack.   The Ministry of Defense, anticipating a possible fourthinsurrection against the government in the past 21 months, bolstereddefenses at Government House and the official residence of PresidentRaul Alfonsin, Telam said.   The civilian president spoke by telephone with Defense MinisterHoracio Jaunarena and Army Chief Gen. Francisco Gassino and toldthem to retake the base, presidential press secretary Jose IgnacioLopez told reporters.   Buenos Aires provincial police surrounded the base, began toevacuate nearby residents, and took up firing positions in privatehomes.   The attackers carried pamphlets in support of officers who haveled previous uprisings, the independent DyN news agency, said. Theincident comes less than two months after a short-lived barracksinsurrection to protest Alfonsin's treatment of the military.   ``A report arrived that indicates the people (civilians) havetaken over the regiment and are taking up positions with heavyarms,'' a town official in La Matanza, which encompasses the 3rdInfantry Regiment at La Tablada, was quoted as telling Telam.   La Tablada is 12 miles northwest of the capital, Buenos Aires.   ``Soldiers, police and civilians are wounded,'' it said. Threecivilians and two police were killed, Telam later reported.   Defense Ministry officials made no statement on the attack, andthe precise number of the civilians involved or soldiers at the basewas not known.   The attack began at about 3 a.m., when civilians threw severalsmall explosive devices onto the base compound, DyN reported.   Employees at a nearby gas station said that at about 6:15 a.m.,civilians in a truck crashed through the regiment's main gate, DyNsaid. Six cars followed.   A total of 40 to 50 men and women dressed in civilian clotheswere in the truck and cars, both news agencies reported. Police putthe number at about 30.   As they entered the base, the civilians threw pamphlets insupport of what is known as the ``New Argentine Army'' of dismissedand imprisoned Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led short-lived armyuprisings in April 1987 and January 1988, according to DyN. Rico hasbeen dismissed and is now in prison.   Other pamphlets read ``Long Live Rico!'' and ``Long LiveSeineldin!'' DyN reported. Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin a four-dayuprising in December. He is also in prison.   By late morning, gunfire still was being heard from the base.   The base was almost empty at the time of the attack, the newsagencies reported. They said most officers and non-commissioned menhad left for the weekend and had not returned.   The December insurrection began after officers at several armybases, including La Tablada, tried to incite troops. Seineldinsurrendered four days later.   The only clashes reported during that insurrection were betweentroops and civilians, many of whom harbor animosity toward themilitary.   On Friday, President Alfonsin told a news conference thatfactions within the army still are angry over issues such as theprosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the1976-83 military dictatorship, which he was elected in 1983 toreplace.   ``I affirm categorically that those factions are not going tohave the possibilities to triumph,'' Alfonsin said. ``But I shouldsay with absolute seriousness that I am not in the position ofassuring with the same force and certainty that there will not beother episodes.''</TEXT></DOC>
