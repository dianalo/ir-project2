The application by Great Western Bank of Beverly Hills, Calif.,was denied by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which rejected theinstitution's claim that it was exempt from a temporary ban ondefections from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.   Great Western, the nation's second-largest FSLIC-insuredinstitution, had filed an application claiming it was eligible toconvert from coverage by FSLIC to insurance with the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.   The application was seen as a test case on whether regulatorswould allow widescale defections from the FSLIC, although severalsmaller Sandamp;Ls already have been allowed to leave the thrifts'insurance fund.   The FDIC is considered the more attractive insurance fundbecause it retains big assets while the FSLIC has been largelydepleted by the losses and failures plaguing the thrift industry.   Legislation enacted in 1987 prohibited thrifts from leavingFSLIC until Aug. 10, 1988, and Congress has since extended themoratorium until Aug. 10, 1989. Thrifts that had already convertedto FDIC or announced their intention prior to March 31, 1987, tocovert by merging with an FDIC-insured bank were exempted.   Under President Bush's $157 billion proposal to restructure andrescue the thrift industry, institutions would be barred fromleaving the FSLIC for another five years. The provision is designedto help the fund recuperate and to ease the costs of the bailout.   Regulators and some members of Congress had been concerned thatwidescale defections from FSLIC could cut the fund's intake ofinsurance premiums and make the Sandamp;L rescue even more expensive.   Great Western applied to leave FSLIC based on its October 1988application to merge with the smaller Great Western Savings Bank ofBellevue, Wash., an FDIC-insured institution. The California thriftalso cited its March 1987 memorandum of intent to merge with GreatWestern Thrift and Loan in Salt Lake City, Utah.   The bank board rejected Great Western's application to mergewith the Washington thrift and said the Utah memorandum was notvalid because no further steps to combine with the Utah thrift hadbeen taken since the agreement was signed.   Great Western, which had assets of $30.8 billion as of Dec. 31,issued a statement saying it was disappointed with the bank board'sruling.   ``We are confident that under existing law and regulation, GreatWestern's program for FDIC membership meets every test and weintend to vigorously pursue all options available to us,'' saidJames F. Montgomery, chairman and chief executive.   The company did not elaborate on what its options might be.</TEXT></DOC>
