<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-84-0070 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the course of several years the author, in cooperation with other workersin the field of wind energy, and a group of unemployed young people developedand built the prototype of a robust and efficient wind energy conversionplant. Because of its size and mode of construction, this plant typeis as well suited for self-construction in this country as it is forcrafts workers in Third-World countries. It yields three kilowatts ofelectric power: enough for the supply of larger appliances and individualhouses remote from the mains grid. To assure that potential self-builderswill definitely attain their goal, the author offers an introductioninto the subjects wind energy utilization, site selection and plant construction;he points out what skills and tools are necessary and describes the constructionof the plant step by step. This construction concept at a 'medium-technology'level is well-matured and makes it possible on the one hand to buildthe plant using half-finished products produced in series and relyingon simple crafts techniques while allowing, on the other hand, enoughscope for the use of available or easily procurable components, especiallyas far as such potentially costly parts as generator and gearing areconcerned.</TEXT></DOC>
