The boards traditionally have granted licenses to practice medicine and are the only authorities that can impose discipline on physicians through the revocation or limitation of their licenses. It is the increasingly vigorous exercise of that authority -- in coordination with the Federation of State Medical Boards -- that is &quot;culling many of the bad apples&quot; out of the profession by legally restricting physicians' ability to practice.    On the other hand, insurers are cost-transfer mechanisms that serve their own members or shareholders. They cannot impose restrictions on physicians, as they are limited to raising rates or refusing to insure unfavorable risks. The bad doctors can continue to practice, or malpractice, simply by paying the higher rates or &quot;going bare&quot; without insurance coverage.    Richard A.
