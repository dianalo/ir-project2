They're even shot in black-and-white.Only Reiner's on-camera introductions are in color.;    Of course, everybody'stongues are lolling around in their cheeks; be on the alert for some 1991&quot;sensibilities&quot; that sneak in from time to time.;    In tonight's comedy,&quot;Daffy Dicks,&quot; Morton and Hayes are running a seedy detective agency when arich, desperate woman (Catherine O'Hara) hires them to find out if her husbandis having an affair.;    When they spy on her husband (Christopher Guest)during his dinner date at the McGuff Inn, the dopey dicks discover he'sromancing O'Hara's evil twin. That leads to a confrontation at the familymanor and a crazy fight to the finish between the evil twin and the twogoons.;    Pollak and Amaral make all this work with inspired clowning. Bothhave concocted comic mannerisms for their characters that are reminiscent ofLaurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello yet remain uniquely their own.;   Pollak, who's best known as a stand-up comic, plays the Bud Abbott-stylestraight man to tubby Amaral, who gets most of the loony physical stuff todo.;    While they're first interviewing O'Hara, for instance, Hayes is takingnotes, which blow out the open window. Naturally, he crawls out onto thewindow ledge of their upstairs office to retrieve the notes, which a feistycrow has decided to claim.;    In another thigh-slapping sequence, thedetectives try to take a picture of the &quot;other woman&quot; with O'Hara's husband.They're in a crowded restaurant, equipped with an enormous camera, trying tobe inconspicuous. Trouble is: The woman never turns her face their way. Sothey start lobbing bread sticks at her, which stick in the back of herhairdo.;    O'Hara, of course, is the ablest of comedy conspirators. Thecomedy veteran from the SCTV troupe and such hit movies as &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and&quot;Home Alone&quot; adds lots of zaniness, especially in her &quot;fight&quot; with the goofyduo, which includes sped-up sword dueling and one bit where she uses theirheads as punching bags.;    But everything really depends on how skillfulPollak and Amaral are at making us believe their shtick and slapstick aregenuine. As it turns out, they're very skillful indeed.;    Can they maintainthe high level of tonight's show? I think so. In a subsequent show, &quot;The Brideof Mummula,&quot; they make fun of the old dark house comedies like &quot;Abbott andCostello Meet Frankenstein&quot; in high style. They're aided by guest star MichaelMcKean as a blood-sucking mummy who talks like Vincent Price. He menaces thetwo goofs, who are travelers in Bavaria. It's worth watching that one just tosee Pollak and Amaral in lederhosen.;    Maybe this sort of thing would wearout its welcome if turned into a regular series, but I'd be willing to riskit. It's certainly better than anything I've seen coming at us this fall.;   The wild, weird west;  Tonight the USA cable network departs from form to giveus an original western movie, &quot;Into the Badlands,&quot; instead of the thrillersthat usually occupy its Wednesday-night movie slot. Bad move, USA.;    ThoughI'm a die-hard western fan, I draw the line at fantasy westerns, which thisone turns into after a promising start featuring Bruce Dern as a colorfulbounty hunter on the prowl for a $5,000 reward.;    We soon learn Dern's T.L.Barston character is mainly a bridging device to link two earlier fablesbefore his own comes along in the final reel.;    In one tale, Dylan McDermottplays a hunted killer who stops in a frontier town for a passionate affairwith saloon girl Helen Hunt. He's delayed just long enough for vengefulpursuer Andrew Robinson to catch him for a gunfight with ghostly undertonesthat will leave you scratching your head in dismay.;    In the other, MarielHemingway is an uptight frontier wife who scolds overnight guest Dern forscaring her kids with stories about a marauding wolf pack in the area. Butwhen she goes to aid ailing neighbor Lisa Pelikan and is trapped overnight bya storm, she winds up battling the wolf pack. Or does she?;    Finally, Dern'sstory finds him bringing in the corpse of his quarry to claim the $5,000reward, only to find the place that posted the reward is now a ghost towninhabited by grubby miners who want to shoot him on sight.;    Dern'scharacter is intriguing -- he has a white beard, steel-rimmed glasses and afull-length black duster, and he drives a two-wheeled cart with a whiteparasol over it -- but the movie is pretentious, dull and has a monotonouslyoverbearing electronic musical score that drives you batty.;    Guess I'llhave to wait for CBS's &quot;Gunsmoke III: To the Last Man&quot; or the &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;sequel that's now being prepared in order to satisfy my craving for westerns.It certainly wasn't slaked by tonight's movie.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ron Miller column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910724  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,038  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 24, 199100206073,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
