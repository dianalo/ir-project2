During a meeting of securities analysts Thursday in Boston, themen who run IBM predicted strong worldwide growth in demand forcomputers despite a cooling domestic market.   They promised to deliver ``kinder, gentler'' computers in theshort term, predicting it would be easier for individuals and moreefficient for companies to use.   In the long term, they said businesses would find more and moreuses for computers, demanding ever larger amounts of memory capacityfor ``paperless offices'' in which products would be designedentirely on computers.   ``Far less than 2 percent of the data that mankind has generatedis coded and stored in any kind of a computer format ... so there isstill tremendous potential for growth,'' said Carl Conti, an IBMsenior vice president.   IBM Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John F. Akers predictedthe computer industry would continue to grow at two to three timesthe rate of the world's economy as a whole.   But Akers said in an interview after his speech to the 150analysts that the U.S. budget deficit is a wild card that couldchange IBM's hand.   ``Our financial position as a country is way out of balance,'' hesaid. ``It's either going to come into balance, ... or there's goingto continue to be a lot of economic fragility.''   The stock prices of IBM and its chief competitor, DigitalEquipment, plummeted during the past week when the companiessignaled their earnings in the current quarter would fall below manyanalysts' estimates.   IBM, the industry leader and the most highly capitalized companyin the nation, has blamed its lower earnings forecast on a microchipmanufacturing problem that has slowed delivery of itstop-of-the-line mainframe 3090S computers.   Production of the chips, which pack up to 2,300 memory circuitson a fingernail-sized slice of silicon, has proved more difficultthan the company expected. Only 2 or 3 of every 10 chips it turnsout are free of flaws and can be used.   Digital, the second largest computer maker, said it has seen asoftening of demand for computers in the United States. At the lowend of the market, more and more powerful personal computers andworkstations have cut into sales of the larger and more expensiveminicomputers and mainframes.   At the meeting Thursday, IBM executives said they have solved thechip problem and will catch up with the backlog in orders by the endof the year. They denied that the problem has hurt demand for themainframes.   Because of the manufacturing delays, Wall Street analystsforecast IBM will earn $10.25 to $10.75 a share this year, down fromprevious estimates of $11 to $11.25 per share.   Several analysts questioned the IBM executives closely about thecompany's continuing reliance on sales of computer hardware forapproximately 70 percent of its revenue, while software and computerservices are the fastest growing segments of the market.   George Conrades, a senior vice president, said IBM realized itneeded to emphasize software development and would begin ``wrappingour hardware like a burrito'' in software and support services.   While the IBM executives declined to make specific estimates forsales or earnings growth this year, they said they expected rapidincreases in the Far East, slower growth in Europe and minor growthin the United States.   Akers also said IBM would compete vigorously in the market forcomputers that use open, or freely licensed, operating systems basedon Unix, an increasingly popular system developed by AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   He said that while IBM faces strong competition from Japanesecomputer makers, it is poised to capitalize on heavy demand forcomputers in Asia and the construction of computerized manufacturingfacilities by Japanese and Korean companies in the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
