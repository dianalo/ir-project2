The world's dominant maker of mainframe computers, IBM controlsabout 70 percent of the market. The huge computers are used by thegovernment and almost all major businesses.   IBM said the improvements would allow computers to obtain accessto information more rapidly and allow users to develop new programsfor their own needs more easily.   IBM also unveiled new models of its biggest line of mainframecomputers, the 3090 series, and of its slightly smaller 4381series. IBM said the new architecture _ a way of putting computersand data storage devices together _ would permit more productiveuse of existing computers.   The computer giant said the new operating system, which governsthe internal workings of a computer, was a major new developmentcomparable to the advent of the System-360 in 1964, the System-370in 1970, and the 370-Extended Architecture of 1981.   The Enterprise Systems Architecture-370, the new operatingsystem, can be used in IBM's 3090 and 4381 mainframe computers.   The ESA-370, which controls the division of room in a computerdata storage device, allows computers to reach 16 trillioncharacters of data that are held in ``virtual storage.'' That is8,000 times greater than the virtual storage accessible with IBM'scurrent operating system.   Information held in virtual storage can be retrieved almost asquickly as information held in the computer's main memory.   IBM also announced a program for helping computers get at storedinformation more rapidly. IBM said the program, called DataFacility Storage Management, is the most ``significant storageadvancement in 20 years.''   It also announced a piece of hardware that allows the 3090 torun as if it were four different computers in one.   ``These new products have important benefits to our customersnow, and help them plan for the future by setting a path for IBMlarge system growth into the next decade,'' said Edward Lucente,IBM vice president and group executive in the U.S. marketing andservices group.   ``They establish a new foundation for future enhancements thatwill continue to help our customers take advantage of these newcapabilities,'' he said in a statement.   IBM said the 3090 models 280E and 500E would cost $4.9 millionand $9.65 million, respectively. The 280E will be available in thesecond quarter of the year, while the 500E will be available in thethird quarter.   The 4381 models 91E is priced at $550,000, and the 92E is pricedat $920,000. Both will be available in November.</TEXT></DOC>
