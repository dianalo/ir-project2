From 1979 to 1983, the FMP was amended annually.In 1984, a framework amendment to the FMP was implemented which provideda mechanism for making preseason and inseason adjustments in the regulationswithout annual FMP amendments (49 FR 43679, October 31, 1984). Amendmentsto the framework FMP were also implemented in 1987 and 1988.Development of Amendment 9 began in September 1987 when a ``scoping session''was held by the Council. Subsequent Council discussions identified sixissues requiring further analyses and possible modifications to the FMP.A draft amendment was prepared and distributed to interested persons forreview on October 14, 1988. Comments were invited, and five public hearingswere held on November 2 and 3, 1988 (53 FR 41222, October 20, 1988).After considering the comments received on the draft amendment at publichearings and Council meetings, and from its Salmon Technical Team, SalmonAdvisory Subpanel, Scientific and Statistical Committee, and EnforcementConsultants, the Council made its final selection of preferred alternativesfor the amendment at its November 16-18, 1988, meeting in Portland, Oregon.The Council selected non-status quo alternatives for the six issues.The major purposes of Amendment 9 are to (1) replace the long-term spawningescapement goal and rebuilding schedule for Klamath River fall chinookwith fixed annual spawning escapement and harvest rates which will allowa fixed percentage from each brood of natural spawners to escape the fisheriesand spawn, subject to a minimum escapement floor for naturally spawningadults; (2) modify the ocean harvest allocation of coho and chinook betweennon-Indian commercial and recreational fisheries north of Cape Falcon,Oregon; (3) revise the coastwide notice procedures for inseason managementactions; (4) conform Federal and State regulations regarding the incidentalharvest of steelhead by recreational fishermen; (5) authorize inseasonreporting requirements for commercial fishermen to provide timely accountingof catches from a regulatory area subject to quota management; and (6)remove the limitations on commercial and recreational season beginningand and ending dates. The rationale for the Council's proposed FMP changesfor items (1)-(4) and item (6), and a discussion of related issues andexpected biological and socioeconomic impacts, are presented in a separateproposed rule for these parts. This rule was published January 19, 1989(54 FR 2177). The rationale, issues, and impacts for item (5) are summarizedbelow.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment Issue 5_Radio Reporting Requirements for Commercial SalmonFishermen</ITAG>The fishery management regime specified annually under the FMP establishesnumerical catch quotas (by salmon species) for designated regulatory areas.Such catch quotas are necessary to ensure that the allowable levels ofocean harvest of salmon are not exceeded in these areas. In order to accuratelyassess catches relative to quota attainment during the fishing season,catch data by regulatory area must be collected in a timely manner. Difficultiesin tracking catches by regulatory area arise when commercial fishermenwith catches from one regulatory area land their catches in another regulatoryarea open to fishing.In 1988, the Council discussed the need for amending the FMP to requirethe commercial fishing vessels which possess salmon taken in the area northof Cape Falcon, Oregon (a regulatory area subject to quota management),and deliver to a port outside of the area, notify the U.S. Coast Guardand receive acknowledgment of such notification prior to leaving the area.The notification would include the name of the vessel, port where deliverywould be made, approximate amount of salmon (by species) on board, andestimated time of arrival. Also in 1988, the Washington Department of Fisheries and the Oregon Departmentof Fish and Wildlife implemented this type of inseason reporting requirementin State waters for their fishermen in order to obtain better real-timecatch data critically needed for more careful monitoring of season quotas.Specifically, commercial fishing vessels (from Oregon and Washington) possessingsalmon taken in the regulatory area north of Cape Falcon, Oregon, and deliveringto a port outside of the area, were required by the States to notify theU.S. Coast Guard and receive acknowledgment of such notification priorto leaving the area. The notification included the name of the vessel,port where delivery would be made, approximate amount of salmon (by species)on board, regulatory area where fish were caught, and estimated time ofarrival. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, approximately 89 radio reportswere received during the 1988 fishing season off the Washington and Oregoncoasts. During and after the 1988 fishing season, no public objectionswere received by the States regarding this type of reporting requirement.Prior to Amendment 9, the FMP did not authorize any Federal reporting requirements,recognizing that most of the catch and effort data necessary for FMP implementationare collected by the State agencies under existing data collection programs.The FMP still generally acknowledges that no additional catch reports willbe required of fishermen so long as data collection and reporting systemsoperated by the State agencies continue to provide the Secretary with statisticalinformation adequate for management. However, in Amendment 9, the Councildetermined that the information collected through the proposed inseasonradio reporting requirement is essential for the conservation of the salmonresources and achievement of the optimum biological and economic yieldsfrom the fishery during the fishing season (May through October). In orderto accurately assess catches relative to quota attainment during the fishingseason, catch data by regulatory area must be collected in a timely manner.Therefore, the Council proposes to implement Federal radio reporting requirementsfor commercial fishermen to provide such timely and accurate accountingof catches in regulatory areas subject to quota management. The real-timecatch information collected from the radio reports will improve the abilityof the managers to attain and enforce regulatory area salmon quotas. Thecurrent State data collection programs do not regularly collect the specifictype of information which the Councils recommended be collected by theinseason radio reports.The proposed collection-of-information will require commercial fishermenleaving a regulatory area subject to quota management, and landing theircatches in another regulatory area open to fishing, to transmit radio reportsto the U.S. Coast Guard (or other designated party) prior to leaving thefirst regulatory area. The information collected will consist of the nameof the vessel, port where delivery will be made, regulatory area wherefish were caught, approximate amount of salmon on board (by species), andestimated time of arrival. Because the exact boundaries of the regulatoryareas subject to these reporting requirements may change annually, certaincontents of the radio reports, and possibly the entity receiving the reports,may have to be adjusted annually.The information collected on vessel name, port of delivery, and estimatedtime of arrival will be provided to State fishery managers to facilitatemonitoring of the actual catch reports submitted in accordance with Statelanding requirements under existing State data collection and reportingsystems. The appropriate Federal and State entities will verify the accuracyof the information collected by comparing the radio reports with the catchreports (fish tickets) submitted in accordance with State landing requirementsunder existing State data collection and reporting systems. The council's proposed measure involves a collection-of-information requirementsubject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and to review and approvalby the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). A request to collect thisinformation has been submitted to OMB approval and the issuance of a controlnumber. Because of the time requirements associated with OMB's review andapproval, this part of the proposed rule implementing Amendment 9 is beingpublished separately for public review and comment. It is intended that,after receiving and considering public comment, it will be combined withthe rest of the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>Section 304(a)(1)(A) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary, upon receivinga fishery management plan or plan amendment prepared by a Council, to makea preliminary evaluation for purposes of deciding if it is consistent withthe national standards and sufficient in scope and substance to warrantreview. The Secretary has decided Amendment 9 does warrant review. A noticeof availability of Amendment 9 (including all amendment measures) for publicreview and comment was published January 3, 1989 (54 FR 49). Under section304(a)(1)(D)(ii) of the Magnuson Act, the Secretary is to publish proposedregulations by the 15th day after the statutory receipt date for the amendment.The proposed rule for all amendment measures except for this collection-of-informationrequirement was published January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2177). The Secretaryhas approved Amendment 9. In so doing, he determined that the inseasonreporting measure of Amendment 9 is consistent with the national standards,other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary,in making that determination, took into account the data, views, and commentsreceived during the comment period on the proposed amendment. The Council prepared an environmental assessment for Amendment 9 whichindicates that there will be no significant impact on the environment asa result of this rule. The environmental assessment has been publishedin a booklet with Amendment 9 and may be obtained from the Council at theaddress listed above. The Under Secretary of Oceans and Atmosphere has determined that this proposedrule is not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysis underExecutive Order 12291. This determination was based on analysis of theregulatory impact review (RIR) prepared for this rule which demonstratesthat the rule will not result in (1) an annual major increase in costsor prices for consumers, individual industries, or government agencies;(2) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; and (3) significantadverse effect on competition, employment, productivity, innovation, oron the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. Based on the Council's initialregulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA), this proposed rule implementingthe collection-of-information requirement, if adopted, will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entitiesfor purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA). Some of the otherproposed management measures of Amendment 9 were anticipated to have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entitiesfor purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, thus requiring preparationof the IRFA. The RIR/IRFA may be obtained from the Council at the addresslisted above. The economic impacts associated with the inseason reporting requirementmeasure were evaluated in the RIR/IRFA and are summarized below. All suchimpacts apply to small business entities because this industry consistsonly of small entities. A summary of the economic impacts associated withthe other amendment measures was published in a separate proposed rulefor these measures (54 FR 2177). <ITAG tagnum="84">Amendment Issue 5_Radio Reporting Requirements for Commercial SalmonFishermen </ITAG>The socio-economic costs and benefits are difficult to quantify due tothe variability of the annual management measures for the commercial salmonfishery. Because most fishermen return to the nearest port to land when a regulatoryarea closes to fishing, only a small number of commercial salmon fishermenwould likely be impacted by this type of reporting requirements_the exactnumber will depend on the specific reporting requirements implemented eachyear. During the past two years, the similar reporting requirements implementedby the States have undergone public review during the preseason processprior to the Council's adoption of annual management measures. It appearsthese reporting requirements have general acceptance by commercial salmonfishermen which increases the likelihood of their enforceability. The inseason radio reporting requirement contains a collection-of-informationrequirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). A request tocollect this information has been submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget for approval as provided by section 3504(h) of the PRA. Given the specific nature of the collection-of-information, in most casesthe respondents will be submitting their radio reports during time-in-transitfrom the fishing grounds at zero cost to the respondents. The collection-of-informationwould not impose additional operating expenses to the respondents becausetheir normal operations include maintaining catch records for State reportingrequirements and operating a radio to monitor, receive, and transmit broadcasts.In those instances when respondents are taken away from wage-earning functions,such as cleaning fish or other maintenance duties, the estimated coststo the respondents would be based on the wage of $20 per hour. Using theestimate that 20 percent of the 50 total estimated burden hours (i.e.,10 hours) would impose actual costs to respondents and the hourly wageof $20, total annual costs to all respondents are estimated to be $200(or an average of $1 for each of the estimated 200 respondents, annually).The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 0.25 hours per response, inducing the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data neededand completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to RollandA. Schmitten, director, Northwest Region, NMFS, 7600 Sand Point Way NW.,BIN C15700, Seattle, WA 98115-0070; and to the Office of the Managementand Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC20503. This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 20, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
