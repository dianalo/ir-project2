A victim is squirted in the back with ketchup from a packet likethose given in fast-food restaurants. A stranger points out thestain, offering tissue to wipe off the mess. While the target cleansup, the stranger's accomplice makes the theft.   Police in Miami arrested three suspects Sunday. There have beennine cases since March 25 at the Fort Lauderdale airport. In NewYork, the police fraud squad calls it the ``ketchup caper.''   ``Ketchup is very big here,'' New York Detective James Tortorasaid. ``They get them when they are kneeling down at St. Patrick's.While you are saying your `Hail Marys,' you get hit with ketchup andthey are walking out the door with your handbag.''</TEXT></DOC>
