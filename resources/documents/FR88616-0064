The rule submitted provided for observer coverageand a permit system for any fishing for anadromous species outside theEEZ. Petitioners also proposed that foreign fishing for anadromous speciesbe defined to include fishing for anadromous species be defined to includefishing by a foreign fishing vessel for squid, pollock, and other nonanadromousspecies in the international waters of the North Pacific Ocean and BeringSea at times of the year and with gear that can reasonably be expectedto result in the taking of anadromous species. The notice provided a 60-daycomment period. NOAA extended the comment period on the petition for rulemakingat 52 FR 49464 (December 31, 1987), until February 29, 1988, at the requestof the North Pacific Fishery Management Council.  Eight comments were received. These were from the Governor of Alaska; theU.S. Coast Guard; the Department of State; the American High Seas FisheriesAssociation; Garvey, Schubert and Barer (on behalf of the Japan FisheriesAssociation); Professor William T. Burke; Harold Sparck and Associates;and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. The majority of commentsopposed issuing a rule in response to the petition and are summarized asfollows: The Secretary has no jursidiction to regulate foreign fisheriesfor nonanadromous species beyond the U.S. EEZ; it is difficult to determinethe country of origin of each anadromous fish; far-reaching questions ofinternational law must be considered in relation to U.S. enforcement authoritybeyond the EEZ; the suggested regulation is in conflict with Article 66of the United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty (UNCLOS); insufficient scientificinformation is available to support the requested rule; the petition relieson an improper interpretation of the Magnuson Act; and the suggested actionis inconsistent with the Secretary's interpretation of the Magnuson Actthat the foreign catch of species fully utilized by the domestic industrybe minimized, but not prohibited. Three comments favored the petition forrulemaking and are summarized as follows: The suggested rule would greatlyreduce high seas interception of Alaska salmon and steelhead and providefor better enforcement; and it would prevent foreign fleets from fishingon stocks of U.S.-origin anadromous fish.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>NOAA has considered the petition and comments in conjuction with otherissues relating to the management of U.S. resources taken in foreign fisheriesconducted beyond the EEZ. For the time being, NOAA has decided not to undertakethe requested rulemaking for the following reasons: (1) NOAA is unableto address satisfactorily the practical considerations relating to enforcementof the action proposed. NOAA continues to examine the available science,as well as U.S. boarding authority and sanctions, in the context of enforcingsalmon interception prohibitions beyond the EEZ. While scientific knowledgeabout salmon is considerable, it is far from complete. It is difficultto prove that U.S. salmon are illegally aboard a vessel because the currentscientific methodologies do not permit reliable identification of individualsalmon as U.S.-origin fish. The principal methods used for tracing stocksof salmon are area tagging, scale pattern analyses, and electrophoreticseparation of proteins. These procedures are generally accepted by thescientific community as capable of indicating the origin of salmon stocks.However, each method is subject to challenge when applied in enforcementactions. Scale pattern analyses do not guarantee accurate results as themethod is subject to the individual interpretations and differing opinionsof the analysts. Further, the scale pattern data base does not includesamples for all age groups and from all geographical areas, and is thereforesubject to some degree of uncertainty. Electrophoretic analysis involvesa chromatographic separation procedure where amino acids from a fish areseparated on a gel plate and analyzed. To provide valid results, samplesmust be preserved at very low temperatures (^60anddegrees; to ^80 anddegrees;C)to avoid degradation. Consequently, application of this method to fishpreserved in normal freezer boxes may provide inaccurate results. Whiletagging provides irrefutable evidence as to the origin of an individualfish, very few fish are tagged. Other identification techniques, sun asmitochondrial DNA analysis and FTIR analysis of scales, are still underdevelopment. None of the methods mentioned, excluding tagging, are equallyeffective for all species; moreover, all are time-consuming, require specialequipment and training, and are therefore done only in shorebased laboratories.Further, reliability of the determinations varies statistically by technique,species, and individual sample. While the continent of origin can be readilydetermined, differentiating between U.S. and Canadian fish is difficult,and the distribution of intermingling stocks of North American and Asianstocks further complicates the situtation. In the areas of overlap thereis no meaningful way to predict proportions of fish that will be encounteredbecause numerous factors (strength of a year group, weather patterns, oceantemperatures, etc.) influence migration. Analytic techniques used to determinecountry of origin require a stable laboratory environment to be accurate;at-sea testing is not yet technologically feasible. Consequently, identifyingprecise areas and times when U.S.-origin salmon are certain to be present,as suggested by the petition, is not currently possible.(2) NOAA recognizes that under the Magnuson Act, the United States hasjurisdiction over U.S.-origin salmon beyond the EEZ except when they arefound within the EEZ of another nation. The United Nations Convention onthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) also provides that states in whole rivers anadromousstocks originate shall have the primary interest in, and responsibilityfor, such stocks. Though the U.S. government did not sign the UNCLOS, thePresident has stated the U.S. intention to accept and act in accordancewith its provisions relating to traditional uses of the oceans, which generallyconfirm existing law and practice. The U.S. Department of State (DOS) furtherconfirms that U.S. policy is to exercise jurisdiction over anadromous fishconsistent with Article 66 of UNCLOS. In pertinent part, article 66 providesthat ``Enforcement of regulations regarding anadromous stocks beyond theexclusive economic zone shall be by agreement between the state of originand other states concerned.'' In accord with Article 66, and U.S. policy,NOAA is working with the DOS to ensure effective flag state enforcementof U.S. regulations governing U.S.-origin anadromous stocks beyond theU.S. EEZ. The United States is currently working to develop a fishery managementregime for fisheries beyond the EEZ that will protect the long-term viabilityof all Bering Sea resources, including anadromous species, and providefor the collection of reliable scientific information on conservation ofthose resources. To this end, (a) NOAA published on April 25, 1988, (53FR 13410) an emergency rule changing the definition of fish to includefish taken outside the EEZ; (b) NOAA published on April 25, 1988 (53 FR13422) an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comments on optionsto respond to illegal fishing in the U.S. EEZ of the Bering Sea, as wellas the possibility of harvests in adjacent areas that threaten U.S. stocks;(c) NOAA has met and will continue to meet with the Soviet Union (whosewaters adjoin our EEZ) to discuss joint concerns over the Central BeringSea; (d) NOAA will also be meeting with the Japanese during the summerof 1988 to discuss a variety of fisheries enforcement issues in the BeringSea (including illegal harvests of salmon); and (e) the United States andthe Soviet Union have agreed to invite scientists from concerned countriesto a scientific symposium during the summer of 1988 to address the conservationrequirements of Bering Sea fishery resources; and (f) NOAA is working withthe DOS, the U.S. Coast Guard, and other Federal agencies to seek greaterinformation about unregulated driftnet fishing activities beyond our EEZthat may be adversely affecting U.S. marine resources. The newly enactedDriftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 providesthe means for the United States to enter into monitoring and enforcementagreements with foreign nations regarding driftnet fishing which resultsin the taking of U.S. marine resources, including salmon, on the high seas.NOAA recently asked the DOS to immediately initiate negotiations with concernedAsian countries on these issues. In view of the above, NOAA believes it would be premature to promulgatea rule responding to the petition submitted by the Bering Sea Fishermen'sassociation. NOAA will continue to work with the DOS to arrive at long-termsolution to international fishery issues that bear upon the protectionof U.S.-origin anadromous species in the Bering Sea. The agency has concludedthat undertaking the rulemaking suggested by the petitioner at this timeis likely to compromise these ongoing efforts while offering little inthe way of actual stock protection due to the inherent practical difficultiesof enforcement. NOAA choose to continue efforts to establish a comprehensivemanagement regime applicable to all resources in the Central Bering Seaand the North Pacifici Ocean. These efforts are intended to produce betterscientific information and techniques to ensure the long term viabilityof U.S.-origin anadromous fish.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 10, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
