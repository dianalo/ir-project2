Having seen theinsides of other big corporations, it is entirely possible that the sourcecode was lying around on some lightly protected AppleShare server.andP;  Maybethat, in combination with a telephone line into the network, made Apple'sfruit ripe for the picking.andM;Big brother, that's who.andP;  Re gardless of the disks' origin, developers atApple will probably find themselves under the sharp end of a microscope atall times.andP;  Loyalty, trust and freedom will be in question from the top tothe front door.andM;In many situations like this, there is a knee-jerk reaction to clamp down.andO;Indeed, if the wrong people get their way, we wouldn't be surprised to seeMacs posted at every exit within Apple, and people entering or leaving havingtheir disks scanned for pilfered source code or dirty PICT files.andM;What did happen to the ancient Prometheus?andP;  In an unsanitized version of themyth, after Prometheus delivered fire to the masses, the gods were sooutraged that they chained him to a rock and dispatched a raven to pick athis liver for eternity.andP;  Expect a similar punishment if the Apple gods catchthis latter-day code arsonist.andM;If the group was really searching for a mythological analogy for its actions,it might have been more apt to choose Pandora, a tired cliche for a punkishprank.andM;In the rest of the industry, as with last year's virus, some companies willbe riddled with suspicion, others will smell a profit opportunity, and mostwill go on, regarding the pilfered source code as just another blip on theradar screen in an otherwise calm sea.andM;We welcome comments at MacWEEK, 4 Cambridge Center, Third Floor, Cambridge,Mass.andP;  02142; (617) 497-2600.andP;  Electronic mail: CompuServe: (Ric Ford)75056,1225, (Rick LePage) 75016,350; Del phi/PAN: MACWEEKBOS; MCI Mail:RICFORD, RLEPAGE, MACWEEKBOSTON; Apple Link (ad dress &quot;MacInTouch&quot; inSubject): MACWEEK; MacNET: RICFORD, RICKLEPAGE; GEnie: MACWEEKBOS; Internet:RICFORD@CUP.PORTAL.COM.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
