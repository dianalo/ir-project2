Seal surface contact pressures are assessed numericallyby finite element analysis and experimentally by direct measurement usinga recently developed technique. The importance of considering both temperatureand time dependence of material mechanical properties is demonstrated.The test procedure is designed to evaluate both mechanical strength andseal integrity under realistic load and temperature conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
