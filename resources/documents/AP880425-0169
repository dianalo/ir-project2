Jackson rejected what he called ``material concessions'' toterrorists but did not rule out political accommodation   ``If we are going to deter terrorism, we must address theunderlying causes of terrorism,'' he said after an appearance at ahigh school in Pittsburgh. ``Terrorism does not emerge out of theblue.''   Jackson met later with Gov. Bob Casey as he prepared forTuesday's Pennsylvania primary but the candidate was beseiged withquestions stemming from a statement he made Sunday.   Jackson said then he disagreed with rival Michael Dukakis'position that ``we should not negotiate with terrorists.'' Jacksonsaid, ``I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'ddo it.''   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Monday that theU.S. government will ``talk to anyone, to any group, to anygovernment about the well-being and release of the Americans stillheld hostage in Lebanon.''   She added, ``We will not make concessions to terrorists orcompromise our fundamental principles.''   But Jackson insisted, ``The fact is that our government hastalked with terrorists and has negotiated, in some instancessuccessfully. It is good as a policy, but there must be alwaysflexibility in the policy. ... We ought to take every initiative wecan to gain the freedom of the American hostages in Beirut.''   Jackson said he believed it made sense to talk with terroristsbecause no one else has direct control over the hostages.   ``The reason that we must keep open to talking with terrorists,or any enemy, is because in the final analysis terrorists, ourenemy, are the only ones who have the ability and power to end theterror and declare peace. ... We must talk to them or find out whattheir underlying grievances are about.''   He noted that as a private citizen, he talked with the StateDepartment before making efforts on behalf of American hostages tomake sure he was not contradicting U.S. policy.   ``The first principle is that we should not jeopardize ournational interests or national security,'' he said.   He said he would not make ``material concessions'' toterrorists, a term he defined that as ``giving something physical.''   Jackson said in certain circumstances, he might be persuaded togrant hostages safe passage and freedom from prosecution inexchange for hostages.   ``We did it to gain the freedom of the hostages in the TWAairliner and I think it was the right thing to do,'' he said. Hewas referring to the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jet in Lebanon.   He also used the Attica prison uprising in 1971 as an example.Jackson said then New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller ``charged andthere was nothing left but blood. I choose negotiation over blindbloody confrontation.''   It was Jackson's talks with Syrian leaders that led to therelease of captured Navy flyer Robert Goodman in 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
