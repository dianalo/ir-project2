Tissue changes induced by the test articles were compared tochanges that occurred in tracheal organ cultures exposed to crocidoliteasbestos (positive control) and glass beads (negative control), in additionto untreated explants. The relative toxicity of each test particle wascharacterized base on qualitative histopathologic and morphometric differencesrelative to the positive and negative controls. Crocidolite asbestosand Ni-coated graphite were the most reactive in this study. Iron whiskers,aluminum dust, and KS-2 graphite caused an intermediate level of tissueresponse, while the remaining substances did not cause significant tissueresponses compared to control explants. The most cytotoxic materialswere brass dust and Ni-coated graphite.</TEXT></DOC>
