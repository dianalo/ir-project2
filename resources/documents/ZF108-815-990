(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The NeXT computer has lots of impressive features, but its lack of afloppy-disk drive is not one of them.andP;  Typically, NeXT machines living inclose proximity to each other will be networked together - Ethernet is builtin - which makes NeXT-to-NeXT file sharing relatively easy.andP;  But what if youwant to export a drawing done on the Mac, say in Illustrator, into aFrameMaker document on the NeXT? For Macs that aren't on Ethernet, which ismost of them, network transfer is out.andP;  You could try begging the NeXToptical read/write drive to read the data off your Mac floppy.andP;  But save yourbreath.andP;  Basically, you've got a problem.andM;Three third-party vendors - Dayna Communications, DIT (DigitalInstrumentation Technology), and Pacific Micro -have solutions to thisquandary.andP;  All three companies make floppy-disk drives for the NeXT thatattach to its SCSI bus.andP;  All three drives read and write DOS- andUNIX-formatted floppies, and one of them reads Mac floppies as well.andM;1 Disk, 2 Disk Black Disk, Blue DiskandM;Before we launch into the details of the three products, however, we shouldbring up a rather significant (but perhaps not immediately obvious) point:We're dealing with three operating systems and twice as many floppy-diskformats here.andP;  The Mac operating system supports two floppy formats: 800K(the most universal) and the newer 1.4-megabyte high-density drive (FDHD).andO;(There's also the old 400K format for the Mac, but that's all but obsolete.)andO;The UNIX operating system, which the NeXT employs, can also formathigh-density (1.4-megabyte) floppy drives, but of course, this format isinconsistent with the Mac's 1.4-megabyte format.andP;  And then there's DOS, whichsupports 720K and 1.4-megabyte formats on 3.5-inch floppy disks and a1.2-megabyte format on 5.25-inch disks.andP;  (DOS also has an older 360K format.)andM;DOS? Why mention DOS in a story about Mac-to-NeXT file transfer? We wish theanswer were, &quot;Well, you might want to move files from a DOS machine to theNeXT too.&quot; Unfortunately, the real answer is that as of press time, all threeproducts relied heavily on DOS as an intermediate format for moving filesfrom the Mac to the NeXT.andP;  With one exception, you have to save your Macfiles in DOS format before you can make the transfer.andM;Does this mean you need to buy a DOS floppy-disk drive for your Mac too? No.andO;AFE (Apple File Exchange), a utility that comes with the Mac's Systemsoftware, lets you read, write, and format DOS floppies in the Mac's internaldisk drive.andP;  This procedure is cumbersome if you do it often, however.andP;  AFEis not integrated into the Finder, and it doesn't mount DOS disks on theMac's desktop.andP;  A better solution is Dayna's DOS Mounter INIT ($89.95), whichcorrectly places DOS disks on the desktop.andP;  DOS Mounter blurs the distinctionbetween Mac and DOS disks.andP;  You can then copy files back and forth betweenthe Mac and DOS-formatted disks by dragging the file's icons in the Finder.andO;With DOS Mounter installed, you only need to use AFE to initialize DOS disks.andM;Another important point is that none of the NeXT floppy-disk drives reviewedhere can read or write 800K Mac floppies.andP;  If you're going to move files fromthe Mac to the NeXT - at least as of press time-you will need a Mac with anFDHD drive.andM;DaynaFile fop NeXTandM;The DaynaFile for NeXT is a matte black box with an external power supplythat houses one or two half-height drives.andP;  The DaynaFile is available inthree configurations: a single 5.25-inch drive (for 1.2-megabyte disks) for$750, a single 3.5-inch drive (which supports both 720K and 1.4-megabytedisks) for $850, or both drives for $1,105.andP;  The 3.5-inch drive is the onlyone you really need in order to exchange files between a NeXT and a Mac, butif you also want to move files to the NeXT from DOS machines that have5.25-inch drives, you'll need a DaynaFile.andM;The DaynaFile for NeXT comes with two NeXT applications: DaynaDOS andDaynaUnix.andP;  To install these applications, you have to execute some UNIXshell commands to get the application files onto a local NeXT drive.andP;  (Thistext-based installation procedure is virtually identical for all three driveswe reveiwed.) Dayna's manual does a particularly good job of walking youthrough the process.andM;The DaynaFile for NeXT can read and write only DOS floppies, and Dayna has noplan to overcome this limitation.andP;  Therefore, Mac files must be saved on aDOS-formatted disk before transfer to the NeXT.andP;  DaynaDOS is the applicationthat accesses DOS disks.andP;  It opens a dialog box that looks a lot like theNeXT's Browser, with one file list displaying the local NeXT file directoryand the other the files on the floppy disk (see Figure 1).andP;  DaynaDOS providesyou with the option of performing rudimentary file translation for PC files,but you don't really need to do this to transfer files between Macs and NeXTmachines.andP;  In fact, translation corrupts binary file types such as those ofWingz and WriteNow.andM;DaynaUnix lets you initialize and mount UNIX-formatted floppy disks in theDaynaFile.andP;  To exchange floppies between two NeXT machines, each with aDaynaFile, you don't have to use DOS floppies.andP;  When the DaynaUnixapplication is running, it makes UNIX-formatted floppies visible andaccessible directly from the NeXT Directory Browser or any NeXT application,just as the DOS Mounter INIT does on the Mac.andM;DIT CubeFloppy 1.4andM;The DIT CubeFloppy 1.4 ($795) is a small black 3.5-inch drive with anexternal power supply.andP;  Its software currently reads and writes only 720K and1.4-megabyte DOS disks, but read/write support for 1.4-megabyte Mac and UNIXFDHD disks should be available by the time you read this.andP;  As it is now, youcan initialize, mount, and unmount UNIX floppies in the CubeFloppy via theNeXT's Shell, a command-line interface, but you need some UNIX knowledge todo this.andP;  As with the DaynaFile, you need to use the NeXT's Shell to installthe CubeFloppy's software onto a local NeXT optical or hard-disk drive.andP;  TheCubeFloppy's manual explains the steps clearly.andM;You connect the CubeFloppy with the supplied SCSI cable.andP;  But instead ofproviding an external terminator, DIT has put a small switch on the back ofthe drive to enable or disable the internal terminator.andM;The CubeFloppy's software is similar to the DaynaFile's (see Figure 2).andP;  Itdisplays a window with two lists, one for local NeXT files and one for thefiles on the DOS floppy in the CubeFloppy drive.andP;  The CubeFloppy software cantranslate the files that are being transferred.andP;  The CubeFloppy program alsoenables you to format DOS disks, a feature the DaynaFile doesn't offer.andM;Pacific Micro PM1.44andM;The Pacific Micro PM1.44 has the most appealing appearance of all threedrives: It is matte black and one foot square, so it fits precisely on top ofor underneath the NeXT cube.andP;  It contains a single 3.5-inch drive, has aninternal power supply, and comes with the necessary SCSI cable.andP;  At $995,it's the most expensive of the three drives (except for the two-driveconfiguration of the DaynaFile).andM;The PM1.44 is the only drive of the three that, at press time, could readMacformatted disks directly.andP;  It only reads them, however - it can't write tothemandM;and can handle only 1.4-megabyte Mac disks, not the 800K variety.andM;In addition, the PM1.44 can write as well as read DOS- and UNIX-formattedfloppies.andP;  There are some limitations here, however.andP;  Although itsdocumentation claims it can read and write 720K DOS disks, we consistentlyhad problems when we attempted to do so.andP;  As far as UNIX is concerned, it canread only UNIXformatted disks initialized by a PM1.44; it can't read UNIXfloppies initialized by a DaynaFile or a CubeFloppy.andM;CubeFloppy 1.4 *** 1/2andM;The CubeFloppy 1.4 is a 3.5-inch floppy drive that reads DOS 720K and1.4-megabyte disks.andP;  By print time, it should be able to read 1.4-megabyteMac and UNIX FDHD disks too.andM;Pros: Very compact unit.andP;  Least expensive of the three.andM;Cons: External power supply.andP;  Doesn't read or write Mac-formatted disks.andM;Manufactured by: Digital Instrumentation Technology, Inc., 901 18th St.andO;#11000, Los Alamos, NM 87544; 505) 662-1482.andM;List Price: $795.andM;DaynaFile fop NeXT ***andM;The DaynaFile for NeXT can contain up to two floppy-disk drives; it allowsfile transfer between DOS disks and the NeXT,as well as creation of NeXT UNIXdisks.andM;Pros: Supports 5.25-inch floppy disks.andP;  Comes with coupon for free copy ofDOS Mounter.andM;Cons: External power supply.andP;  Doesn't support Mac disks.andM;Manufactured by: Dayna Communications, 50 S.

!andP;  Moving files from one platform to another isn't the onlychallenge in sharing files between the Mac and the NeXT.andP;  Congenial fileformats are an equally important part of the process.andP;  If applications can'tunderstand your data, file transfer is pointless.andP;  Fortunately, Mac and NeXThave several file formats in common.andP;  Files from Wingz 1.1, one of the firstapplications available on both platforms, are completely interchangable (evenwhen they include charts and draw and text objects) between Mac and NeXT.andM;The graphics formats supported by the NeXT are TIFF (Tag Image File Format,for scanned images) and EPS (Encapsulated PostScript).andP;  Fortunately, most Macgraphics applications support one or both of these formats in addition to theMac's native PICT format, which the NeXT cannot understand.andP;  We were able tomove both TIFF and EPS files back and forth between systems successfully.andO;(When saving an EPS file on the Mac for export to the NeXT, you don't need tosave it with a PICT preview; the NeXT reads and displays the PostScriptdirectly.)andM;Two options exist for formatted text documents: WriteNow's file format andRTF (Rich Text Format).andP;  The WriteNow wordprocessing application comesbundled with the NeXT.andP;  Most word processors on the Mac can save as and openRTF, WriteNow, or both.andP;  MacWrite II even has a specific WriteNow applicationfor the NeXT translator that handles the differences in the NeXT and Maccharacter sets.andP;  WriteNow itself only handles the differences in files thatare going from Mac to NeXT, not f rom NeXT to Mac.andM;But there can be problems.andP;  WriteNow uses font numbers to identity fonts, andthe same font can have a different ID number on a Mac than it does on a NeXT(such numbering inconsistencies can also occur between Macs).andP;  When fontnumbers don't match up, text displays in the wrong typeface.andP;  RTF has thebenefit of identifying fonts by name rather than by number, making it morelikely to retain font information correctly.andM;The Bottom LineandM;Of the three drives, we liked the CubeFloppy ($795) the best.andP;  It is theleast-expensive 3.5-inch solution and has easy-to-use software.andP;  At presstime, the CubeFloppy could read, write, and format DOS disks only.andP;  By thetime you read this, however, it should be able to mount UNIX floppies andread and write Mac FDHD disks as well.andP;  The addition of these features willmake the CubeFloppy the clear winner.andM;The DaynaFile for NeXT  3.5-inch drive only, $850; 3.5-inch and 5.25-inchdrives, 1,1 05) was our second pick, even though it doesn't read or write Macdisks (and Dayna has no plans to change this).andP;  The DaynaFile for NeXT is anevolution of the DaynaFile for Mac - it's a mature product.andP;  For those whowant to move files between DOS machines with 5.25-inch floppy-disk drives andthe NeXT, as well as between the Mac and the NeXT, DaynaFile provides theonly available solution.andM;The PM1.44 ($995) is more expensive than the other units.andP;  It is able to readMac 1.4-megabyte disks, but this feature may not be worth the extra cost.andO;Its UNIX format isn't compatible with that of the other two drives.andM;Regardless of which drive you choose, we recommend that you install Dayna'sDOS Mounter INIT ($89.95) on your Mac, since it provides tremendousfunctionality for a small price.andP;  With DOS Mounter and any of the threedrives for the NeXT,you can read from and write to the same floppy from threedifferent platforms.andM;Table 1:  Supported Floppy-Disk FormatsandM;DaynaFile   DIT              Pacific MicroandM;for NeXT    CubeFloppy 1.4      PM1.44andM;DOS 720K                 R, W        R, W              R, WandM;DOS 1.4 MB               R, W        R, W              R, WandM;DOS 1.2 MB (5.25-inch)   R, W        no                noandM;UNIX 1.4 MB              R, W        no*               R, W+andM;Mac 800K                 no          no                noandM;Mac 1.4 MB (FDHD)        no          no                RandM;R = readandM;W = writeandM;* Not supported from the graphical interface; must use the UNIX commandlineandM;+ Cannot read DaynaFile or CubeFloppy UNIX-formatted disksandM;Table 1: None of the three floppy-disk drives can read or write Mac 800Kfloppy disks, although the PM1.44 can read Mac FDHD disks.andP;  All three canread and write DOS-formatted 3.5-inch 720K and 1.4-megabyte disks andUNIX-formatted 1.4-megabyte disks.andP;  Only the DaynaFile can read and writeDOS-formatted 5.25-inch 1.2-megabyte floppy disks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
