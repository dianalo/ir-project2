They figure matters of the soul are so sensitive that dealing with them in commercials is bound to offend people. But this year, a few brash admen are finding the antics of some TV evangelists just too tempting to resist.    Two TV commercials -- one for Florida tire stores and the other for Nissan car dealers -- parody evangelist Oral Roberts's plea for $4.5 million to prevent God from calling him &quot;home.&quot; And last week, a mortgage company began running a radio ad featuring Fannie Mae Shaker, a takeoff on fallen minister Jim Bakker's wife Tammy Faye.    There's also a Highland appliance store commercial showing Sincere Sam, a blustery preacher dressed in a white suit. The ad was created before the Oral Roberts and Bakker episodes, but it has been getting heavier play since evangelists became front-page news.    &quot;Any time you can leverage yourself off a well-known national phenomenon like the evangelist affairs, you're going to break through the advertising clutter,&quot; says Bink Garrison, president of Ingalls, Quinn andamp; Johnson, the ad agency for Nissan dealers in New England. &quot;We should work on an Ollie North commercial next.&quot;    IN THE NISSAN commercial, organ music plays as a salesman thunders, &quot;Friends, I have received a message! Unless your New England Nissan dealers sell all their new Sentras and trucks, I will be called home.&quot; New England preachers were incensed but not totally surprised by the commercial. Says Rev. Glenn Myers of Immanuel Baptist Church in Pawtucket, R.I., &quot;I feel the ad is in very poor taste, but that's Madison Avenue for you.&quot;    The ad was pulled off the air by a few stations after one of Nissan's own dealers in Maine complained about it. But most dealers were swayed more by marketing than spiritual concerns. The ad is being credited, in part, for a 23% increase in Nissan's June sales in New England.    Allied Discount Tires in Orlando, Fla., says its sales, too, have been heavenly since it ran a controversial ad in which a spokesman tells viewers, &quot;I just got a message from upstairs. It says we gotta sell 80,000 tires in the next month, or I'm gonna die.&quot;    Northeastern Mortgage Corp. may be the first advertiser to exploit the Jim Bakker sex scandal. Speaking with an exaggerated Southern drawl in the radio ad, Fannie Mae Shaker warns of &quot;wayward disciples preaching the pleasures of -- dare I say it -- convertibles.&quot; She says she's a believer in fixed-rate mortgages because with such loans, &quot;you won't get caught financially exposed.&quot;    Since the ad began running in Boston last week, Northeastern says, it has received 400 calls inquiring about mortgage applications and only one irate response. Even so, the company is playing it safe and won't air the commercial in the Southern Bible Belt.    ---   'Intramarketing' With Coloring Books    As a top marketing executive at American Express Co., Jerry Welsh created a number of successful promotions and memorable ad campaigns. Now, he has moved to E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., where he's doing something a bit offbeat for a marketing man. He's designing coloring books for the securities firm.    That's right, coloring books like the ones kids scribble in. Today and tomorrow, Hutton's 18,500 employees in the U.S. and Europe will receive &quot;The Hutton Neighborhood Coloring Book&quot; and a box of crayons. The book is filled with cute drawings of houses, children and race cars, alongside some quite sobering messages about problems Hutton faces. For example, the book points out that: &quot;We're no longer the nicest house on the block. We're not even close. In fact, we're in big trouble.&quot; The book also talks about &quot;new bullies trying to kick us around&quot; and shows tough kids wearing T-shirts that read Sears and Schwabs Cut-rate Cowboys. But all ends happily: the Hutton kids build a souped-up car and win the brokerage race by working together to cut costs and give customers the best service.    Typically, a company's personnel or public-relations department handles employee communications. But Mr. Welsh, Hutton's senior executive vice president of marketing, took on this assignment and is treating the coloring book much like a campaign to sell products and services to consumers. &quot;I call it intramarketing -- marketing inside your own organization,&quot; says Mr. Welsh. &quot;We're selling our view of the company and its future to employees.&quot;    WHY A COLORING BOOK? &quot;We packaged our message in a way that will get people's attention,&quot; Mr. Welsh says. &quot;It's not another boring employee manual nobody will read.&quot; Like any good marketing campaign, the coloring-book project also will include merchandise tie-ins (posters and T-shirts) and promotions (perhaps a coloring contest).    Mr. Welsh's objective is to motivate Hutton's employees to pull together as the company struggles to recover from a series of major setbacks -- among other things, a guilty plea to federal mail and wire fraud charges in 1985 and a loss of $90 million last year. The coloring book sidesteps the legal troubles but does mention the financial problems in a tale about competing lemonade stands.    The success of any marketing effort, of course, ultimately depends on consumer response, and the consumers -- Hutton's employees -- may dismiss this as a juvenile gimmick. Mr. Welsh acknowledges that possibility, but he believes people will be charmed. &quot;Our coloring book is childlike,&quot; he says, &quot;not childish.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
