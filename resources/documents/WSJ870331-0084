It was the largest divestiture yet in Allegheny's effort, begun last year, to scale back operations and focus on its North American consumer products business.    The price was at the low end of what analysts expected Allegheny might fetch for the razor and match concern. William Miller, investment manager at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., expected Wilkinson would be sold for $160 million to $200 million.    Allegheny said the actual purchase price was $230 million, but that it owed Wilkinson $70 million and as a result, it will only receive $160 million in cash from Stockholm-based Swedish Match. Allegheny, which has struggled the past two years under heavy debt and mounting losses, declined to elaborate.    Earlier this month, Allegheny agreed to be taken private in a leveraged buyout arranged by a unit of First Boston Corp. The buyout is valued at $500 million. At the time the buyout plan was disclosed, Allegheny said it had signed letters of intent to sell Wilkinson, but it didn't identify the prospective buyer.    Allegheny last year recorded an $80 million charge associated with the anticipated sales of Wilkinson and its Pacific appliance group, mainly from the write-off of foreign currency adjustments and goodwill. The appliance group was sold last week to Australia's Reil Corp. for an undisclosed amount. Allegheny said then that it expected a &quot;future increase in tangible net worth&quot; as a result of the sales.    Allegheny bought a 44% stake in Wilkinson in 1978 and the remaining shares in 1980. Allegheny launched a major advertising campaign in the U.S. to increase Wilkinson's share of the razor market, but the expensive effort didn't help much. Wilkinson brand razors have less than 1% of the U.S. market for wet razors.    Swedish Match had been discussing the purchase of Wilkinson for about a year, but negotiations accelerated last August after Allegheny hired Dillon, Read andamp; Co. to help it sell certain foreign and industrial and technology specialties operations.    Swedish Match was mainly interested in Wilkinson's match business. Swedish Match is the world's largest maker of matches, while Wilkinson is No. 2. More than half of Wilkinson's annual sales come from its match operations.    One analyst estimated that Wilkinson had 1986 sales of $290 million. Allegheny doesn't disclose sales of units.    For 1986, Allegheny reported a net loss of $164 million on sales of $1.33 billion, but said the latter figure didn't include sales at Wilkinson, which was treated as a discontinued operation.    Allegheny shares closed yesterday at $24.50, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Separately, a group including Gabelli Group Inc. said it holds an 8.1% stake in Allegheny. According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the stake was purchased from March 10 through last Friday. The filing said the group bought the stake for investment purposes and &quot;not to acquire control of (Allegheny's) business.&quot; Allegheny said it wouldn't comment on the group's purchase.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed funds that are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or through asset sales.    ---   Stephen D.
