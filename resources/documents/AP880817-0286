(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Polaroid Corp. will remain a takeovertarget despite new barriers to hostile bids, analysts said afterthe company rejected a buyout offer from a California investmentfirm owned by a Disney family member.   Polaroid's 13-member board of directors unanimously rejected asinadequate a bid valued at roughly $3 billion Tuesday from Roy E.Disney's Shamrock Holdings Inc., and said it planned to remainindependent.   Polaroid also said it was lowering to 20 percent from 40 percentthe stock ownership threshold that automatically triggers itsanti-takeover ``poison pill,'' which is designed to make a hostilemerger prohibitively expensive.   ``It says they're clearly intending to fight this thing,'' saidAlex Henderson of Prudential Bache Securities. ``I think it'ssignificant in that Polaroid is willing to be pro-active inexpanding its defenses.''   But he said Polaroid probably would be willing to entertain alucrative offer. ``The ultimate weapon in all this is money,'' saidChuck Ryan of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. ``If theoffer is high enough, what was unfriendly can become friendly.''   Shamrock, which owns 6.9 percent of Polaroid, last weeksweetened its offer of $40 a share to include 40 percent of anysettlement in Polaroid's $5.7 billion patent infringement caseagainst Eastman Kodak Co.   The base $40 a share values the company at $2.88 billion, or$2.48 billion if Shamrock succeeds in rolling back a recent issueof 10 million shares that it objects to.   The payment of 40 percent of the Kodak settlement could add $400million to $800 million to the value of the deal, assuming theKodak settlement falls in the range of $1 billion to $2 billion.   ``The Polaroid board concluded that Shamrock's proposal isinadequate and not in the best interests of the company and itsstockholders,'' Polaroid stated.   Shamrock spokesman Thomas Reed declined to comment on Polaroid'srejection or his firm's future plans.   Analysts said they were not surprised Polaroid that rebuffed thebuyout offer and expected Shamrock to make a hostile bid soon.   Polaroid's rejection came as Shamrock received federal clearanceTuesday to buy 50 percent or more of Polaroid's outstanding sharesand a New York investment house reportedly made a friendly takeoverproposal for Polaroid.   In its statement, Polaroid said the board also voted unanimouslyto remain independent ``in light of the business, financialcondition and bright future prospects of the company, including thestatus of the pending Eastman Kodak litigation.''   The board determined ``it would be in the best interests ofPolaroid and its stockholders...to continue as an independent,publicly owned company, and that the sale of the company would notbe appropriate.''   Analysts were divided over whether Polaroid's statement that itwould remain independent means it will not consider any futuretakeover offers or is simply ruling out Shamrock.   ``I've always had the impression they would want to remainindependent and not be taken over by these people,'' said WilliamRelyea of Eberstadt Fleming Inc. ``They take into account thedirection of the company and the employees more than other groupsmight tend to.''   Shamrock has interests in three television and 14 radiostations, an energy services company and 56 home entertainmentsoftware stores in Los Angeles.   Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday thatPolaroid had rejected a friendly takeover proposal made by the NewYork investment firm of Forstmann Little andamp; Co., but said the firmmay pursue a bid at a later time. Forstmann and Polaroid declinedto comment on the report.   Forstmann, a private New York leveraged buyout firm withdiversified corporate holdings, has more than $2.5 billion incapital. It has acquired more than $5 billion in companies,including Lear Siegler Inc., Dr. Pepper Co., Cybron Corp.,Midland-Ross Corp. and The Topps Co. Inc., in recent years.</TEXT></DOC>
