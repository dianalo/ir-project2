The decision, the first legal test of the government's new financial-markets investigative powers, will hamper inspectors' efforts to determine whether civil servants illegally leaked advance knowledge of government decisions on mergers and takeovers.    Justice Leonard Hoffmann of the High Court said: &quot;The public interest in the protection of sources outweighs the value of disclosure for the purposes of the investigation.&quot;    The Department of Trade and Industry, which launched the investigation, said any decision to appeal would be made by the outside investigators appointed by Trade and Industry Minister Paul Channon. The investigators, John Lindsay and Peter Crozier, couldn't be reached for comment.    The government wanted the court to order Jeremy Warner, a reporter for the Independent newspaper of London, to divulge sources of information for articles that correctly predicted government antitrust decisions involving two takeover attempts.    The first, when Mr. Warner was employed at the Times of London, predicted the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would find that Scottish andamp; Newcastle Breweries PLC's 1985 bid for Matthew Brown PLC didn't present antitrust problems. The second predicted that Strong andamp; Fisher (Holding) PLC's 1986 bid for Garnar Booth PLC would be referred to the commission for review.    There were no allegations that Mr. Warner profited from the information. The government argued that he could help identify those who leaked the information with the aim of profiting from it.    Justice Hoffmann agreed with the government that evidence from Mr. Warner &quot;may provide useful jigsaw pieces to fit into the picture&quot; of the possible inside trading scheme. But he said he wasn't convinced that identification of Mr. Warner's sources would provide &quot;the key to the puzzle.&quot;    Mr. Warner said the principle of preserving a source's anonymity is necessary to get to the public information that is, ultimately, beneficial. &quot;Without guaranteeing certain people anonymity, there's no way to get that feed of information,&quot; said Mr. Warner. He noted that many of the recent revelations to reporters about the investigation of events surrounding Guinness PLC's takeover of Distillers Co. came from anonymous sources.    Under a law that took effect last November, the government can force witnesses in insider-trading cases to testify or face fines or imprisonment. </TEXT></DOC>
