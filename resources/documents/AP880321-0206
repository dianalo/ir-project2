Until now, the vice president had avoided direct comment onwhether he supported Reagan's veto. But, as he campaigned inHartford, Conn., he told reporters who asked him about it: ``I'mnot going to start differing with the president now.''   ``I'm not going to start doing now what I haven't been doing forseven years, finding differences with the president, for whom Ihave great respect,'' he told the group in Washington, whichapplauded enthusiastically his remarks about the bill.   The Civil Rights Restoration Act passed both chambers earlierthis year by large margins. Both supporters and opponents of themeasure said there was little chance the veto would be sustained.   The measure would forbid the distribution of federal funds toentire institutions, state and local government agencies and manycorporations if any part of them practices discrimination.   It was prompted by a 1984 Supreme Court ruling that civil rightslaws applied only to a specific program or activity receivingfederal aid. Under the decision, for example, the government couldnot cut off money to a college if the discrimination occurred in adepartment that did not receive such aid.   Supporters of the measure say it restores civil rights laws tothe way they were interpreted before the court challenge mounted bytiny Grove City College in Pennsylvania.   Bush criticized the measure, but added: ``Having said that,however, the federal government must require that organizationsthat get tax dollars comply with our civil rights laws.''   He said in Hartford that he believed the president should haveline-item veto powers so he could ``take some of the extremes'' outof a piece of legislation.   The Reagan administration has called for an alternative billsimilar to an earlier Republican plan voted down in Congress, whichwould grant religious schools and organizations as well ascorporations more exemptions from civil rights laws.   Earlier Monday, Bush picked up endorsements from Gov. Thomas H.Kean and New Jersey's county Republican chairmen, a gain that onechairman said was ``like winning the state's presidential primary.''   ``We Republicans have had a spirited campaign. We've heard goodideas, from Jack Kemp, from Bob Dole, from Pete du Pont, from AlHaig and from Pat Robertson. Now it's time for our party to cometogether,'' said Kean with Bush by his side.   ``George Bush is our leader, and with the Republican vision of astronger America that offers opportunity to all regardless of coloror creed, we can not only retain the presidency, but send (HouseSpeaker) Jim Wright to the back benches for the rest of thiscentury,'' Kean said.   The popular governor abandoned his neutrality one week afterBush won the Illinois primary, taking a commanding lead for theRepublican nomination.   New Jersey's 21 county Republican chairmen, who had been waitingfor Kean to act, followed the governor's lead and voted to endorseBush at a breakfast meeting Monday.   Kean also campaigned Monday with the vice president inConnecticut, which holds its presidential primary next Tuesday.   In Bloomfield, Conn., the vice president, whose father was aU.S. senator from Conecticut and whose brother and mother stilllive in Greenwich, said: ``I don't want to be beaten in thisstate.''   ``We're taking nothing for granted. There's no arrogance factor,no overconfidence certainly,'' Bush said.   Bush was also asked about a possible pardon for former nationalsecurity adviser John Poindexter and former White House aide OliverNorth, who have been indicted in connection with the Iran-Contraaffair.   ``Pardon imputes guilt, it seems to me, a pardon for something.That has not been established,'' the vice president said. ``Thesystem has to work; it will work.''   In New Jersey, Assemblyman Richard Kamin, the Morris County GOPchairman, said the endorsements were ``like winning the state'spresidential primary,'' almost assuring that Bush will win NewJersey's 64 Republican delegates. The state's primary is June 7.   ``It is significant to have them at this point, when you haveyour opponent still vowing to go on,'' Kamin said.   In his endorsement speech, Kean cited two themes he has embracedas governor: the need to improve education and the need forRepublicans to practice the ``politics of inclusion'' by reachingout to blacks and others not usually in the party's fold.   The governor said Bush ``wants to be the education president.''And he said Bush ``doesn't just talk about expanding the RepublicanParty; he has been doing it for more than 20 years.''</TEXT></DOC>
