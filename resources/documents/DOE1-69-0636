The purposeof automation is not to eliminate the expert cost engineer. The goalis to use available technology to have more information available tothe professionals in the cost engineering field. In that sense, the demandfor expertise increases in order to produce the highest quality estimateand project possible from all levels of cost engineers. We cannot overemphasizethe importance of using a good source of expert information in buildingthese types of programs. ``Garbage in, garbage out'' still applies inthis form of programming. Expert systems technology will become commonplacein many vertical markets; it is important to undersand what can and cannotbe accomplished in our field, and where this technology will lead usin the future.</TEXT></DOC>
