Treaty on Toxic Waste</HEAD><BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Delegates from 105 countries onWednesday approved a draft U.N. treaty to control shipments ofdangerous wastes across international borders.   The convention, the first of its kind, calls for keeping suchshipments to a minimum.   The draft treaty requires all countries to provide detailed priorinformation on intended toxic shipments and to ensure that importingnations can handle them in an ``environmentally sound'' way.   Signers pledge to forbid all transports to countries that haveimposed a ban.   Waste generation and dumping in foreign countries are to be keptto a minimum. Developing countries were promised technical aid.   The treaty, drafted in hard bargaining over the past 18 months,is meant to confront growing international waste traffic and fearsabout poor, debt-ridden countries accepting shipments in lucrativedeals.   Switzerland, joined by Hungary, launched the idea in 1983.   In a first step toward its going into effect, 34 countries signedthe convention at a final full meeting that approved the text byconsensus. The text remains open for signature.   Twenty countries must formally ratify the treaty before it can gointo force. U.N. officials have said this could take up to two years.   The United States, Britain and West Germany were among majorindustrialized countries not signing immediately. Delegates weretaking the text back for consideration by their governments.   More than a dozen industrialized countries did sign on Wednesday,including Canada, France, Italy and host Switzerland. Hungary wasthe only Soviet bloc country to sign.   Wednesday's ceremony climaxed a three-day conference of seniorofficials, including 50 ministers.   None of the 40 African delegations signed the convention.Several, including Nigeria and Togo, were among 11 nations who tookpart in the talks but were not at the concluding meeting.   Mostafa Tolba, chief of the sponsoring U.N. Environment Program,said African lands are committed to the treaty and he expects theirsignatures after a policy-setting summit meeting in June of theOrganization of African Unity.   Most waste traffic is between industrialized countries. But Tolbawarned that movements between developing countries were on the vergeof becoming a problem, which ``God knows how we are going tocontrol.''   ``Our agreement has not halted commerce in poison,'' Tolba saidin prepared closing remarks.   ``But it has signaled the international resolve to eliminate themenace hazardous wastes pose to the welfare of our sharedenvironmdnt and to the health of all the world's peoples.''   He urged all countries to ratify the convention quickly and toobserve its provisions immediately.   A statement from the Greenpeace environmental group reiteratedcharges that the text merely legalizes the international waste tradeand was weakened to please industrialized countries. It again calledfor a complete ban on cross-border dangerous shipments.   A total of 42 countries, more than half in Africa, have bannedwaste imports, Greenpeace said.   The convention does not explicitly cover shipments through amember's territorial waters, a point demanded earlier by manycoastal states.   Another contentious issue, liability for damage from wastes, wasput off for further talks.   U.S. delegate Philip Winn served notice that Washington wouldoppose such talks.   New bilateral waste trade treaties with non-signers are allowedbut must offer at least as much protection as the U.N. provisions.   The United Nations will help monitor compliance with the accord.A treaty review conference should be held within a year.   Final approval became possible after negotiators compromisedTuesday over last-minute Third World demands for tougher language,including greater responsibilities for waste-exporting countries andtighter compliance provisions.   Among the 16 Third World countries signing immediately wereAfghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Haiti, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico,Panama, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia.   Delegates celebrated completion of the conference with champagne.   The problem was highlighted last year when tons of toxic wasteshipments from industrialized countries were found dumped in Africannations and when waste-laden ships traveled from port to portseeking permission to unload.   Turkey, in a statement to the conference, charged the convention``has a number of weaknesses,'' particularly in its protection ofwaste transit countries. It warned that illegal traffic will riseunless additional measures are taken before the treaty enters intoforce.</TEXT></DOC>
