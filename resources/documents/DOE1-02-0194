With the reservoir engineering studies that arebeing done at this field and which are considering the application ofdifferent mathematical methods and analytic models, it is expected thatin the medium and long term it will be possible to generate 620 MW withproven reserves, and further studies should define probable reservesfor a total of 1540 MW. At Los Azufres in the state of Michoacan therehas been a first attempt at simulation, applying SHAFT-79, developedat Berkeley. This led to the conclusion that in the southern part ofthe field there is sufficient mass and energy to generate an additional55 MW to the 25 MW that have been produced since 1982 with 5 portablewellhead units. At the Los Humeros field, which is in the south centralpart of the state of Puebla, work is currently being done with a networkof 140 units using the SHAFT simulator, and although there is not yetmuch information, it has been possible to determine that the reservoiris enclosed by volcanic rock of andesitic composition, which is coveredby ignimbritic rock and its basement consists of sedimentary rock representedby clayey limestone. Fifteen kilometers to the west of the city of Guadalajarain the state of Jalisco there is the geothermal field of La Primavera,in which 5 exploratory wells have been drilled to depths from 700 to2000 m; modest production has been obtained from these wells. In 1984well PR-1 was deepened from 1226 m to 1806 m, yielding successful results(60 T/H of steam). This led to the conclusion that the reservoir is deeperand that future wells should be no less than 2000 m deep. 11 figures,6 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
