Francaise des Petroles </HL><DD> 09/12/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><CO> F.TCF WNEWS EUROP </CO><TEXT>   France, as it prepares to restructure the country's chemical business, is moving to replace the chairman of its second largest oil company, Total-Cie. Francaise des Petroles, with Serge Tchuruka, a 51-year-old chemical executive.    Officials say they intend to have Mr. Tchuruk named to Total's board tomorrow. He isn't scheduled to take over the chairmanship until the current chairman, Francois-Xavier Ortoli, reaches the retirement age of 65 in February, they said.    Mr. Tchuruk has won praise from both the left and right in France for his success in turning around Orkem S.A., a mishmash of unprofitable chemical companies grouped into a single entity after the Socialists first gained power here in 1981. By dint of heavy government subsidies and layoffs, Orkem turned a profit in 1987, after 20 years of losses by its various units.    Mr. Tchuruk's planned appointment sparked speculation that the government will simply merge Orkem with Total. Officials say Orkem, despite its profits, must be merged with some other company because it remains too small to compete in the European Community after trade barriers are cut at the end of 1992. But officials said Orkem's fate isn't decided.    France's main chemical companies, as well as its oil companies, are either owned outright by the government or include heavy government investment. Hence, despite the trend toward a hands-off policy toward more industries, the government sees nothing wrong in imposing its reorganization plan on the chemical business. </TEXT></DOC>
