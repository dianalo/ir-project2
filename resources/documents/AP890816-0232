The contract calls for Philips to design, manufacture and installthe communications systems needed for delivery of the Channel Onenews service and other educational programming that Whittle plans tomake available to schools across the country beginning next March.   Whittle has ordered about 300,000 television sets, 15,000videocassette recorders and 8,000 satellite dishes as part of itscontract with Philips.   Whittle plans to give dozens of sets, two VCRs and a satellitedish to each school that agrees to run the Channel One news showwith ads every day.   Philips, which is based in Knoxville, Tenn., where Whittle alsois headquartered, said the order was the largest single order ofsatellite broadcasting systems it ever has received.   Philips, a subsidary of North American Philips Corp., producesabout 2.5 million televisions a year.   ``We wanted this system to be designed and manufactured by thebest in the business. We've got that,'' said Christopher Whittle,chairman of Whittle Communications.   Philips said it plans to start building the 19-inch colorMagnavox TV sets specified in the contract at its Greeneville,Tenn., plant in late 1989. It expects to add more than 200manufacturing employees at the facility.   Philips has contracted with RSI-SatCom Technologies Division ofDuluth, Ga., to manufacture the satellite dishes and install andservice the TV sets, VCRs and satellite systems in the schools.   Whittle hopes to have 1,000 schools hooked up at the nationallaunch of Channel One in March 1990 and 8,000 schools by the end of1990.   Philips was one of three companies that Whittle previously saidwere under consideration for the technology contract.   The other contenders were Japan's Sony Corp. and VideostarConnections, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.'s Electronic DataSystems Corp.   Atlanta-based Videostar had supplied, installed and serviced thehardware for Whittle's seven-week test of the Channel One service insix schools last spring.   Awarding the technology contract would enable Whittle to reaffirmits proposed spring 1990 launch of Channel One even as someadvertising executives privately speculate that Whittle is havingtrouble lining up sponsors and schools.   Whittle executives have insisted their rollout plans are onschedule and are confident they will have a full lineup of sponsorsand the 1,000 schools signed by the spring startup.   The media concern plans to pay for producing the Channel One newsshow and the equipment for schools by selling two minutes ofadvertising time on each 12-minute program.   Several national educational groups have decried allowingadvertisers to pitch products to students while they are in class.State education officials in New York have banned Channel One frompublic schools and the top education official in California has saidhe will reduce state aid to public schools there that air it duringthe school day.   Just this week, Turner Broadcasting System Inc. stepped up thepressure on Channel One by launching its own daily commercial-freenews show designed for use in the classroom.   Turner's project, however, does not include the donations ofvideo gear planned by Channel One.</TEXT></DOC>
