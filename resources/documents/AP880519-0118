He said he was told of the apparent switchin Moscow's position by Soviet Foreign Minister EduardeShevardnadze during an 1{-hour meeting Wednesday in Moscow.   There was no immediate response from Moscow.   Siddhi declined to say when and where the talks would be held.He spoke with reporters at Bangkok airport upon returning fromMoscow. He had accompanied Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, whoremained in the Soviet capital.   The official Radio Thailand today quoted a Foreign Ministryreport as saying that in talks with Prem on Wednesday, Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``pledged to assist in every way in thesearch for a political settlement of the Cambodian problem andagreed with Cambodia being a neutral and independent country.''   Soviet officials previously have said they had no direct role toplay in the situation. Vietnam has occupied Cambodia since 1978,when it drove the bloody Khmer Rouge from power.   The State Department says Vietnam has 120,000 soldiers inCambodia.   The Soviet Union is the main supplier of arms to Vietnameseforces that are battling guerrillas backed by Thailand and othercountries. Cambodia is on Thailand's eastern border, and Bangkokregards the Vietnamese occupation as its major security threat.      While visiting Thailand last month, the Soviet deputy foreignminister, Igor I. Rogachev, said the Kremlin couldn't pressureHanoi on Cambodia because Vietnam is a sovereign country.   Thai officials responded that Hanoi would be forced to end theoccupation if the Soviets stopped supplying arms.   Radio Thailand said that in talks with Gorbachev, Prem referredto the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and said he believed theCambodian conflict also could be resolved. Gorbachev then pledgedto help.   Siddhi said that Moscow wants him to hold talks on Cambodia withVietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, after Thailand'sgeneral elections on July 24.   The Khmer Rouge, a radical communist guerrilla group, defeatedthe U.S.-backed Cambodian government in the spring of 1975 andforced the evacaution of the country's cities, making the residentsgo into rural areas to work. Millions of Cambodians were killed bythe Khmer Rouge or died of starvation and disease.</TEXT></DOC>
