He has just about everything a presidential candidate could want_ except a realistic chance of winning.   Nevertheless, Cardenas is galvanizing the normally moribund andcynical world of Mexican politics with his maverick candidacy. Hehas opened fissures and fractures in the base upon which thegoverning Institutional Revolutionary Party has rested comfortablyfor generations.   Cardenas, 54, is matched against the balding, 40-year-oldtechnocrat, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is the hand-pickedcandidate of the governing party's inner circle.   That party, known as the PRI, hasn't lost a presidential,gubernatorial or senatorial contest since its inception in 1929 andis not expected to so do on July 6.   The race is about the national mood following a steady erosionof PRI loyalty and in a time of economic crisis that has lastedthroughout President Miguel de la Madrid's six-year term.   The pressure from Cardenas on the left, coupled with that fromNational Action Party candidate Manuel Clouthier on the right, mayforce genuine change on the PRI, many analysts and commentators say.   Cardenas is a political handler's dream. He has experience, goodlooks, the ability to stir crowds without stooping to demagogy andthe ability to weather scathing attacks from the pro-governmentmedia. And both of his names are heavy with symbolism.   His father was Lazaro Cardenas, the beloved reformist presidentfor the PRI who carried out sweeping land reform and nationalizedMexico's oil in 1938, ushering in what is called the ``golden age''of modernization. Cuauhtemoc was Mexico's last Aztec emperor.   Cardenas has been extraordinarily successful at tapping a richvein of dissatisfaction with the status quo.   He draws large crowds, even in comparison to the carefullyorganized PRI rallies. Rapt audiences listen to speeches thatsometimes resemble an almost scholarly discourse _ then break outin cheers and applause.   ``The people are with you!'' they chanted at a recent rally.   The Cardenas message is populist and nationalistic. PRI, hesays, has abandoned the 1910-1921 Mexican Revolution's goals ofsocial justice and economic equality. Instead, he charges, itcaters to foreign interests and the prosperous Mexican elite that``collaborates'' with them.   Cardenas, a PRI senator for many years and former governor ofthe central state of Michoacan, broke away from the governing partylast year after it rebuffed his demands for primary elections andother reforms.   His campaign under the banner of a coalition called the NationalDemocratic Front steadily gained momentum. It finally swept theleft, or at least most of it, into a unified front _ long anelusive goal in Mexican politics.   ``I can see that the people of Mexico desire change, but not asprofound, as radical as we are offering in the Mexican SocialistParty,'' said Heberto Castillo, after abandoning his own socialistcandidacy this week in favor of Cardenas. ``Because of this, theyhave turned to Cardenas.''   During the campaign, Cardenas has softened his position onseveral key issues, including Mexico's $100 billion foreign debt.   A new platform calls for suspending payments under the currentterms, instead of a total moratorium. It also calls for reforms inthe judicial system.   The momentum of Cardenas' campaign reportedly has prompteddebate inside the PRI about how large a victory it can affordwithout dangerously alienating a large portion of the electorateand embarrassing itself worldwide.   Salinas de Gortari is said to be pushing for a modest margin ofvictory while old-line PRI politicos want the usual landslide.   Cardenas has said, ``The people will recognize the true winner.They will not acknowledge someone who tries to claim victorythrough fraud.''</TEXT></DOC>
