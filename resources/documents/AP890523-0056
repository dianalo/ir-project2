The honoraria figures, compiled by the public interest groupCommon Cause, came from the annual House financial disclosurestatements that were released Monday.   The final honoraria figures for the year could surpass the 1987total of $6.7 million once financial disclosure forms are receivedfrom an additional 20 lawmakers who were granted extensions of upto 30 days in which to file their reports. The reports not yetavailable included that of House Ways and Means Committee ChairmanDan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the 1987 honoraria leader with $245,000.   The annual disclosure forms filed by all 535 members of Congressprovide a look at members' wealth and outside income. Each formlists a member's money received, assets and liabilities. The Senatereports were released last Friday.   Rank-and-file House members were allowed to keep $26,850 inhonoraria in 1988 _ leaders slightly more. The amount over thelimit, more than $1 million, was donated to charity while nearly$4.8 million was kept for personal use.   Most lawmakers also supplemented their $89,500 salaries withinvestments, while others made money in more unorthodox ways.   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., a Northern CheyenneIndian, earned $5,000 last year for his jewelry designs.   Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., a former National BasketballAssociation player, received deferred income totaling $45,000 fromthe Washington Bullets and Atlanta Hawks.   House Speaker Jim Wright, facing House ethics committee chargesof 69 rules violations, reported income between $188,183 and$203,579 and assets ranging from $31,005-$100,000. These figures donot include holdings in a blind trust established by Wright in1987. Those assets and the income they produced were not availableMonday.   The speaker earned $30,000 in honoraria, a figure eclipsed by 45other House members who filed on Monday.   Wright paid off debts totaling between $105,000 and $220,000,including money he owed to his former investment partnership,Mallightco, and a bank.   The special counsel to the ethics committee said Wrightsatisfied these notes with money he made from his share of an oiland gas investment that is still under investigation by the panel.   Not everything was revealed by House members.   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., noted that the ethics committeewaived the reporting of wedding gifts in a letter dated Dec. 16,1988. Spence, a widower, got married last July 3 in a hospital roomwhile recovering from a double lug transplant.   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who said hisassets are no more than $45,000, did not list any royalties in 1988from his book, ``Window of Opportunity.''   A complaint is pending before the House ethics committee inconnection with a limited partnership formed in 1984 to promote thebook.   The honoraria system was in jeopardy early this year, when Houseleaders were ready to abolish it and institute other reforms inreturn for a 51 percent pay raise. The effort collapsed when afurious public let lawmakers know they opposed the increase.   The fees of $2,000 a speech are controversial becauseinvitations usually come from special-interest groups courtinglawmakers, and because often the events are held at resorts wheremembers and their spouses can enjoy free vacations.   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House ArmedServices Committee, earned the most honoraria of those who filed,$114,376. Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House DemocraticCaucus, was second with $110,788. House Majority Whip Tony Coelho,D-Calif., was third with $90,100.   The disclosure statements showed members like to travel.Gingrich's expenses were reimbursed on 11 trips for speeches tovarious groups. GOPAC, a political action committee chaired byGingrich which promotes Republican candidates, paid the expenses on14 trips by Gingrich and three by his wife.   House Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois listed some ofthe side benefits of taking part in charity golf tournaments: $966worth of golf clothing and paraphernalia from the Bob Hope DesertClassic, the Kemper Open, the Jerry Ford Invitational and others.   Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, reported $20,021 in residual incomefrom ``The Love Boat,'' the long-running television series in whichhe played Gopher.   Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., reported $11,212 in residuals for hisappearances on the ``Dukes of Hazzard.''   Although some members do provide specific figures, the forms donot require such precise data. Generally, wealth can be listedaccording to broad ranges.   For example, properties worth $52,000 and $98,000 could both belisted in the $50,001-to-$100,000 range. An asset worth millionscould be listed simply as more than $250,000 unless a member choseto spell it out.</TEXT></DOC>
