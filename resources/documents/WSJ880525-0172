To Sell Volvo Cars in Japan </HL><SO> </SO><CO> VOLVY JAPAN SBRU </CO><IN> AUT MON </IN><TEXT>   AB VOLVO announced an agreement to sell Volvo autos in Japan through the distribution network of FUJI HEAVY INDUSTRIES LTD.    At a news conference in Tokyo, the two companies said sales of Volvo cars at five of the Subaru dealerships operated by Fuji will start in October. They said the number of Subaru dealerships that handle Volvo cars will be raised to 15 by next year.    Officials wouldn't specify the Volvo models to be marketed. They said, however, that the models will probably come from the Volvo 200 and 700 series, which are what the Japanese define as upscale cars with an engine capacity larger than two liters.    The Swedish auto maker is aiming to sell at least 6,000 cars a year in Japan by 1990, Volvo President Roger Holtback said. Last year, Volvo sold 3,300 units there. &quot;My ambition for Japan is that we should sell about 25,000 Volvo cars in the middle of the 1990s,&quot; he said. Fuji President Toshihiro Tajima said, &quot;Volvo cars will enable us to meet today's broad customer needs by adding a new model line in the upper segment where we currently do not offer any products.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
