The finding has been incorporated into an EPA ``technicalcompendium'' of the latest research on passive smoking, sometimesreferred to as ``environmental tobacco smoke,'' or ETS.   The report has not yet been released. Documents with informationon its contents were obtained by The Associated Press from theTobacco Institute and from the office of Rep. Thomas Bliley ofRichmond, Va.   ``It would ... in my judgment be most inappropriate to includethis paper in its present form in the EPA ETS Compendium ofTechnical Information,'' wrote W. Gary Flamm, a Tobacco Institueconsultant, in summarizing the six-inch high stack of comments thatthe Tobacco Institute sent to the EPA.   The chapter was written by Stanton Glantz and William Parmley,both professors in the department of medicine at the University ofCalifornia, San Francisco. Parmley is a past president of theAmerican College of Cardiology.   Elissa Feldman in the EPA's indoor air division said thetechnical compendium is still undergoing revision, and that itprobably would not be released until later this summer.   Glantz presented many of the chapter's findings on May 21 at ascientific conference in Boston, but he did not disclose that theywere included in the EPA's passive smoking report.   Robert Axelrad, director of the EPA's indoor air division, saidGlantz had been given permission to discuss his findings as long ashe did not mention his connection with the EPA.   He noted that the technical compendium was not a determinationby the EPA of the risks associated with passive smoking, but acollection of state-of-the-art summaries of research on passivesmoking.   ``It will contain disclaimers that the views of the individualauthors do not represent the views of the EPA,'' he said.   The link between the EPA document and Glantz's presentation inBoston came in a June 6 letter to EPA Administrator William Reilly,in which Bliley said that Glantz's presentation in Boston was basedon the EPA report.   Bliley has had a long interest in tobacco issues. Philip Morrisis the largest private employer in his congressional district.   The chapter concludes that passive smoking causes 32,000 heartdisease deaths each year and a total of 50,000 deaths each year,when heart disease and cancers are combined.   That makes passive smoking the third leading cause ofpreventable death, behind smoking and alcohol, the report concludes.   The study, based on a review of existing scientific studies,also concludes that passive smoking increases a non-smoker's chanceof dying from heart disease by 20 percent to 30 percent.   Glantz said he could not discuss the details of the criticismsfrom the Tobacco Institute and Bliley until the EPA report isreleased.   He did make several general comments, however. ``All of thepeople who have reviewed this material, both within the EPA and asit was submitted to the scientific peer review process, have beenfavorable _ except the Tobacco Institute,'' he said.   The comments from the Tobacco Institute and Bliley's letter bothinclude a strongly worded personal attack on Glantz, using similarlanguage. They accused him of being an anti-smoking advocate whosepolitical activity compromises the integrity of his scientific work.   ``The fact that they're conducting an ad-hominem attack on meshows that they can't find anything wrong with our work,'' Glantzsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
