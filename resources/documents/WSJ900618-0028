At some facilities, parents now can get child-care anytime of the day or night, whether they work odd hours or aresimply going to see a show. Some offer gym and swimmingclasses, and transportation to baseball and soccer games.Others let parents buy prepared meals to take home and reheatfor dinner. Even some centers serving low-income families aretaking a broader view of their role by arranging for a doctorto visit weekly or providing immunization shots to children.</LP><TEXT>   To go with their new flexibility and novel services,innovators in the child-care field also have developedsophisticated marketing strategies, keeping their eye on thebottom line. Indeed, many of the more elaborate child-carecenters are actually making money in an industry with tightprofit margins. Their primary targets are affluent,two-income families and corporations looking for ways to easefamily pressures. Many corporations, which often don't wantthe hassles of operating an on-site child-care center, preferto subsidize spaces for employees' children nearby.   &quot;The child-care business is professionalizing and doingwhat other market-oriented businesses do -- satisfying theneeds of its customers,&quot; says Michael Connelly, president ofLepercq Capital Management Inc., the venture capital unit ofLepercq, deNeuflize andamp; Co., a New York investment bankingfirm.   Lepercq Capital has been investing in &quot;high-end childcare.&quot; A company launched by Lepercq two years ago alreadyoperates 12 child-care centers in Pennsylvania and NewJersey, with three more set to open this fall, and plans formore elsewhere. Lepercq recently invested $600,000 to acquirea 20% stake in Sunrise Preschools Inc., which provides carefor about 3,600 children in 12 facilities in the Phoenix,Ariz., area, and two in Hawaii.   Lepercq says it was led to Sunrise by a reputation forquality and its pioneering programs. Consider the options:Sunrise offers round-the-clock care for working parents withlate night, overnight and weekend schedules. It sets upsatellite facilities at the Phoenix civic center and arearesort hotels to provide care for the children ofconventioneers and vacationers. The Phoenix Symphony andHerberger Theatre have tie-ins with Sunrise so parents canmake a child-care reservation when they order their tickets.   &quot;The type of parent we serve needs a lot of attention,&quot;says Buffy Owens, executive vice president of Sunrise, where40% of the families enrolled have annual incomes exceeding$50,000 and another 20% have annual incomes of $35,000 to$45,000. &quot;They earn more, they're having fewer children perhousehold than ever before, they're having children muchlater in life and have more disposable income, so they'relooking for a place that can take care of both the parents'and the child's needs.&quot;   In Chicago, the Lakeshore Teaching andamp; Learning Center aimsto do the same. Its &quot;flex&quot; programs offer &quot;clients&quot; theoption of two to five days a week divided into anycombination of half days, three-quarter days or full days.The center's parents, more than half of whom areprofessionals with combined incomes of more than $50,000,include diplomats and politicians.   Richard Levin, president of the Lakeshore center, usesadvertising and public relations skills acquired in a pastcareer to market the nine-year-old center, which boasts 99%occupancy with 350 children aged five months and up, eventhough the $135 weekly rate is the area's priciest.   To promote his center, Mr. Levin contracts with an outsidepublic relations consultant, publishes quarterly newsletters,and holds constant tours of the center. One of the localtelevision stations shot background for &quot;Year of the Child&quot;public service announcements at the center. &quot;Every time youturned around, there we were&quot; on television,&quot; says Mr. Levin.He also uses direct mail, and recently bought a list ofseveral thousand names targeted to affluent local ZIP codeswithin 10 to 20 minutes of the center.   Of course, many child-care centers prefer the traditionalpath. Flexible hours can be an administrative nightmare. Andsome believe that other programs divert attention from thebasic tasks of quality care and education. But there areincreasing numbers of parents and employers who need morethan that, and apparently are willing to pay for it.   Though Mr. Levin says quality care for the children ismore important than the bottom line, &quot;we can't be in businessunless we make a profit.&quot;   At Sunrise, tuition runs from $84 to $130 a week, whichputs it at the high-end of the local market. But up to 30% ofits enrollment is subsidized by employers. AnnamarieJennings, an attorney with the city of Phoenix, has twochildren enrolled in a Sunrise center. Like other city andcounty employees, she gets a 25% discount under a $356,000three-year contract the city and county negotiated withSunrise to reserve spaces for 150 children who use it fulland part time.   Cheryl Walsh and her husband, Jeff, both attorneys withthe law firm of Snell andamp; Wilmer, pay $86.40 a week for childcare for their two-year-old daughter, Keely, because of a 10%discount negotiated by their employer. Their Sunrise facilityis just three blocks from their Phoenix office, and comes inhandy for weekend and evening care when they have to workovertime.   Sunrise says it has gone out of its way to cater tocorporate needs, and its roster also includes McDonnellDouglas's helicopter subsidiary, the U.S. Postal Service andseveral hospitals. To accommodate America West Airlines Inc.flight attendants, baggage handlers and other employees withdiverse work schedules, Sunrise agreed to run a 24-hour,seven-day-a week facility. It also created a new rateschedule for part-time, three-quarters time and full-timecare. The airline subsidizes up to 50% of the weekly tuition.   &quot;Child care up to now has pretty much been held hostage bythe attitude that people in child care give of themselves andthat everybody must be the Mother Theresa type,&quot; says DavidPierson, editor of Child Care Review, a bimonthly journal formanagers of child-care centers. &quot;The fact is that therearen't that many saints on the face of the Earth. They've gotto figure out a way that a buck can be made.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
