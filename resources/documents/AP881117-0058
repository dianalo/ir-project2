Some 2,000 riot police in green combat fatigues and black,visored helmets blocked 7,000 farmers and other protesters who triedto get to the embassy in central Seoul.   ``Drive out U.S. imperialists,'' and ``Oppose U.S. agriculturalproducts,'' protesters shouted as they marched to the beat of drumsand carried hundreds of red, white and yellow flags and placardsdenouncing the United States.   Hundreds of protesters hurled rocks and bricks at riot police andattacked troopers with clubs after they were blocked a few hundredyards from the embassy.   Radical students who joined the march hurled a few firebombs atpolice.   Police fired tear gas and hurled back rocks tossed by protesters.Some officers and protesters were seen being taken away withinjuries, but police had no figures on injuries or arrests.   No protesters got close to the embassy. Marchers dispersed afterabout 90 minutes of clashes confined mainly to one main street.   Protesters claimed their farms were threatened by cheap foodimports, such as those from the United States. Many protesters woreheadbands saying, ``No U.S. wine and beef.''   The United States has been pressuring South Korea to open itsmarkets to American imports, especially agricultural products, tohelp correct Washington's $10 billion annual trade debt with Seoul.   South Korea has made some concessions on American beef, wine andother food imports. Angry farmers repeatedly have protested againstany import concessions, but the protest today was the most violent.   The farmers' march turned violent when police stopped it justbefore it passed the Seoul headquarters of Citibank, a U.S. bank.Police repeatedly charged the rock-throwing protesters to drive themback.   Several thousand more riot police ringed the embassy and guardedstreets leading to the building. Police also protected nearbyresidences of U.S. diplomats.   The protesters also denounced former President Chun Doo-hwan anddemanded he be arrested for corruption and human rights abuses.``Kill Chun Doo-hwan,'' some people in the crowd yelled.   The farmers had rallied near the National Assembly building andthen marched peacefully the six miles to the embassy, shepherded bycolumns of riot police. Many people watching cheered the protestersand shouted encouragement. Large numbers of Koreans oppose imports.   The rally became as much a protest against Chun as the UnitedStates. Many Koreans are demanding the former president be punishedfor alleged corruption and human rights abuses.   Several of Chun's relatives and former associates have beenconvicted or charged with corruption. The government is trying todefuse the controversy by having Chun apologize to the nation andreturn his personal wealth.   Chun, a former general, who took power with military backing in1980, is resisting demands he accept exile to the countryside indisgrace. He insists he did nothing wrong personally during hisseven-year term that ended in February.</TEXT></DOC>
