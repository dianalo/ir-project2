(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Personal Information ManagersandM;Personal information managers (PIMs) descended from an earlier generation ofsoftware known as desktop organizers.andP;  Lotus Development Corp. coined theterm PIM for its Agenda in 1988.andM;A PIM helps a user keep track of people, projects, time and tasks -- in otherwords, random information.andP;  Most PIMs can make free-form notes and searchthem for common links or relationships.andP;  Most also have intelligent date andscheduling features.andM;The trend seems to be toward PIMs with databases structured for full text.andO;So far, user interfaces and functions show no real consistency except forthose that run under Microsoft Windows.andM;Micro networking has created a new niche for information managers in thecategory of groupware.andP;  Groupware does everything a PIM does for theindividual, but it also has time-management and contact-tracking features formultiple users.andP;  Many PIMs mentioned in this Buyers Guide have networkversions.andM;&quot;Personal&quot; information varies a great deal from one person to another.andP;  Itmight be finance-, contact-, project- or action-oriented data.andP;  It could besimply an unstructured collection of ideas.andM;Obviously, any program that can organize unstructured notes, schedules, phonenumbers or lists several ways is going to be complex enough to try manypeople's patience.andP;  It may be that no one package can handle both structuredand unstructured information well.andM;Sluggish SalesandM;Despite vendors' promotion of PIMs as a new software category, sales so farhave been fairly slow.andP;  About 50,000 copies of Agenda have sold; no other PIMcomes close to that figure.andM;Why?andP;  One reason is that busy managers may find a PIM too tied down to acomputer for real usefulness.andP;  The more powerful packages cannot run onlaptops.andP;  Vendors try to get around this obstacle by enabling some PIMs to beupdated from a workstation.andM;At present, PIMs seem to be poised between the stand-alone world of the pastand the networked multiuser environment of the future.andP;  Because they need tomove information back and forth between the desktop, portable computers andoutput devices, industry analysts speculate that PIMs will have to focusincreasingly on distributing rather than manipulating information.andM;The latest PIMs such as Hewlett-Packard Co.'s new Wave Office, IBM Corp.'sCurrent and Polaris Software Inc.'s PackRat run across many platforms underthe New Wave and Windows interfaces.andP;  These graphical user interfaces removethe need for the old memory resident feature of PIMs.andM;Newer PIMs share data transparently in multiuser environments, mix free-formwith structured data and do broad text searches.andP;  At the personal level, theyprovide electronic mail, calendar, address book, notebook, filing andtelephone dialing features.andM;Specialized PIMsandM;Some PIMs specialize in just one thing.andP;  General Information Inc.'s Hotlinephone management software, for example, can dial a number from the screen ora telephone directory imported from a database package.andP;  Hotline does nothave electronic mail or group calendars, but it does its single task well.andO;It can run resident in memory.andM;Conductor Software Inc.'s Act, another specialist package, has a goodreputation for sales tracking.andP;  Within this same single-task category arehard-disk managers such as Lotus Development Corp.'s Magellan and TravelingSoftware Inc.'s ViewLink.andP;  They retrieve, display and organize files on ahard disk.andM;However, the dedicated PIMs may perform their functions well at the expenseof managing other kinds of personal information flexibly.andM;At the opposite end of the spectrum stand programs like Agenda, which isflexible to the point of confusion, although its real function is textmanagement,andM;Persoft Inc.'s IZE, a hypertext program, and Group L Corp.'s Memory Laneresemble free-form databases.andP;  They can search for information in masses ofunrelated text.andP;  Persoft recently shifted its marketing emphasis for IZE frompersonal data management to free-form data management.andM;Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum is DayFlo Tracker from DayFloSoftware Corp., a text-based database manager for contacts.andP;  It resembles atraditional database program, but allows unstructured text fields.andM;Valor Software Inc.'s Info-XL handles everything from free-form notes tostructured records and appointments.andP;  Chronos Software Inc.'s Who-What-Whenis a project management and time-tracking tool that accommodates individualwork styles, even though it handles structured data.andM;Certain note-taking packages, such as Tornado from Micro Logic Corp., oftenare described as PIMs.andP;  From embedded key words, they retrieve all notescontaining a specified word.andP;  Although they manage unstructured informationreasonably well, they lack basic PIM features like calendars and phone lists.andM;Before buying any PIM, it is essential to analyze needs first.andP;  Bear in mindthat hardware limitations can cut down the power and speed of a PIM.andM;Assess Your NeedsandM;First, consider the nature of the information to be handled: Is it free-formwith varying lengths, types and ordering, or is it always structured the sameway?andP;  Is it finance-, contact-, time- or idea-oriented?andP;  Assess whichactivity will consume the most time.andM;Determine whether schedules are set individually or in close consultationwith others.andP;  Are projects likely to be on long or short deadlines?andM;If you choose a free-form database program, remember that it probably cannotcalculate and sort as well as structured database PIMs.andP;  In a networkedsetting, any shared information must be structured; information confined toone person need not be so organized.andM;For the manager whose daily schedule is of paramount importance, there arePIMs to set up daily appointments.andP;  For time/date control, consider programslike Calendar Creator Plus from Power Up Software Corp., Primetime Personalfrom Primetime Software Inc., Who-What-When from Chronos Software and Syzygyfrom Information Research Corp.andM;People who spend most of their computer work time in traditional applicationslike pop-up PIMs to check their schedules or look up phone numbers.andO;Memory-resident PIMs include Borland International Inc.'s SideKick Plus,Arriba from Good Software Corp. and Primetime Personal.andM;Selecting an OrganizerandM;Besides notepads, simple databases and calendars, memory-resident PIMs oftenhave features not found in stand-alone programs, such as calculators and theability to dial a number displayed on the screen.andM;If organizing information is important, look for a database managercustomized to link various bits of information that organize free-form datainclude Lotus Agenda, AskSam from AskSam Systems, IBM's Current,Hewlett-Packard's New Wave Office, PackRat from Primetime Software Inc. andInfo-XL from Valor Software.andM;For time scheduling a package like Calendar Creator Plus from Power UpSoftware Corp. makes beautiful reports.andP;  Symantec Corp.'s GrandView is strongon text-oriented reports, while IBM's Current and Hewlett-Packard's New WaveOffice produce quite attractive documents.andM;The more sophisticated packages let the user design custom reports.andM;Best, of course, is a PIM that can create custom reports but also has alibrary of canned reports.andM;Ease of inputting and getting information out of a PIM is vital, especiallywhen updates occur throughout the day.andP;  Memory-resident PIMs have a distinctadvantage here over their stand-alone cousins.andM;People dislike changing their work habits.andP;  Someone who deals with a mix ofstructured and random information, and who likes to have access to the wholeas well as the parts, would feel most comfortable with a package likeInfo-XL.andM;An analytical thinker who plays with ideas in unstructured ways rather thanwith records would prefer Agenda.andM;The user with a clear idea of what he wants and how he intends to get it willtake to a package like GrandView, which is a superb outliner for an organizedmind.andM;Once you have determined the requirements, select the simplest program thatfits -- not one with extra features that probably will never get used andmight even slow things down.andM;Act 1.1 from Contact Software International Inc., with the familiar Lotus1-2-3 menu, is the PIM for 1-2-3 users.andP;  Primarily a database for contacts,it includes details such as date of contact, next action to take and lettersalutations.andM;Act keeps a history of all interactions.andP;  It accommodates primary andsecondary address and telephone information, and can search on manyinformation fields.andM;Act's word processor can use existing data to create letters, memos andnotes, automatically stamping them with date and time.andM;Agenda 1.01 from Lotus Development Corp. is a powerful tool for experiencedusers.andP;  But novices find it hard to learn because they must know in advancehow the information they enter will be used.andP;  Categories must be thought outahead of time.andP;  Adding them later is a slow process.andM;No Graphical InterfaceandM;Agenda needs better time management features; for example, the time intervalbetween appointments cannot be modified.andP;  And in the age of graphical userinterfaces, a product introduced as recently as 1988 should not have atext-based interface.andP;  Version 2.0, due this summer, reportedly has a newmenu structure.andM;Agenda rewards those who invest time and effort.andP;  It recognizes a variety oftime and date formats and manipulates data superbly.andP;  It can build astructure around any free-form data.andP;  However, learning to do all that is areal feat.andM;Other drawbacks: A heavyweight program like this should handle file formatsbetter.andP;  File conversion is tedious.andP;  Also, reports should be easier tocreate.andM;Arriba 1.0 from Good Software Corp. accepts both free-form, unstructured dataand traditional database information, which it stores in folders.andP;  It has acalendar but does not permit multiple appointments.andP;  Multiple calendars areindeed possible, but having to keep track of them defeats the purpose of aPIM.andM;However, the calendar feature has one sympathetic touch: It displays data incolors depending on the user's stress level, as determined by the number ofappointments scheduled for a particular day.andM;Overall, this package is very easy to use, with a complete and balancedcombination of phone book, calendar, to-do list and forms.andM;AskSam 4.2 from AskSam Systems is a text-based database, managing structuredand free-form data equally well.andP;  The user controls the type and form of dataentered as well as the ways it can be searched.andM;AskSam stores data in documents as well as records and imports free-formtext.andP;  Structured and free-form data can mix in individual records.andM;Hypertext is another feature of AskSam.andP;  Words in records can be chosen toselect files or invoke programs.andM;AskSam's reporting capabilities run to labels and reports with complexlayouts.andP;  However, novices cannot tap this power immediately.andM;Current 1.0 from IBM Desktop Software will be a favorite with those who knowthe Microsoft Windows interfacec.andP;  It works best on newer micro platformswith high-resolution screens, mice, laser printers and graphics software.andO;All these are not essential, but having them makes Current a more powerfultool.andM;Current is the natural choice for a desktop publishing or computer graphicsenvironment.andP;  It has on-screen icons and graphical representations of anaddress book, calendar and Gantt project management chart.andM;Although the package comes with predefined categories such as people,appointments, to-do lists, projects and expenses, these can be customized andother categories can be added.andP;  Anything that appears in one category but isrelevant to another category automatically connects with it; the user defineswhich words or ideas to connect.andM;Transferring Between WindowsandM;Current can transfer text and graphics between any Windows-basedapplications.andP;  There are supplied form letters as well as custom ones.andP;  Theoutliner can lay the groundwork for a project and later transfer it to othercategories.andM;The automatic assignment featue defines key words and phrases thatautomatically create connections to other categories whenever they occur.andO;Current performs many functions smoothly.andP;  Its intuitive interface makes iteasy to use.andM;DayFlo Tracker 1.4 from DayFlo Software Corp. works much like a traditionaldatabase program, allowing unstructured text fields in addition to typicaldatabase features.andM;The user can create an on-screen form with field names.andP;  DayFlo Trackersorts, searches and selects on certain fields.andP;  It generates memos andletters, and allows more than one data-entry format in the same file.andM;That makes it possible to create different forms for phone notes, memos,letters and project tracking, later retrieving information across thedifferent form types.andP;  The package comes with 70 pre-designed forms andreports.andM;GrandView 1.01 from Symantec Corp. basically is an outline program fororganizing thoughts and producing reports.andM;Once a subject appears in an outline, it can be categorized in many ways anddata can be added.andP;  GrandView's word processor produces polished reports ofthe outline and data.andM;Simple queries are possible, one at a time, on data within each category.andO;But data cannot be reorganized within a category except for sorting oralphabetizing.andM;When a new outline is added, the user can select a date and priority for theoutline.andP;  It is possible to work with up to nine outlines simultaneously andto record repetitive keystrokes as macros.andM;Info-XL from Valor Software Inc. usually is cited, along with Agenda, as thedefinitive PIM.andP;  Version 1.02 makes outlines, database records, free-formnotes, and daily and monthly calendars.andM;Info-XL is easy to use.andP;  Each facility appears in a different window, but thefocus is on the outline window, which organizes data in all other windows.andM;One frustration is the lack of direct access to the calendar window.andP;  Entriesin other windows have to be date- and time-stamped to get to the calendarwindow and, once there, cannot be edited directly.andM;Info-XL searches for data in all the windows.andP;  It even checks for up to fourlevels of spelling closeness on entries the user cannot quite remember.andM;There is a limited macro facility for recording keystrokes.andM;PackRat 2.0 from Polaris Software Inc. runs under Microsoft Windows andshares some of its advantages, such as dynamic data exchange withWindows-based applications like Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet.andM;PackRat can schedule repetitive tasks.andP;  Its auto-dial capability is one ofits strongest features.andP;  On the time management side, PackRat will not raisean alert when scheduled tasks overlap.andP;  The package comes in a networkversion.andM;Primetime Personal 1.23 from Primetime Software Inc. is an inexpensiveprogram that lends itself to laptop because of its small size.andM;The user can enter tasks, assignments and appointments, and attach shortnotes of up to five lines.andP;  Most other PIMs do not limit note length.andM;Date and time functions may be relative to the current date, such as twoweeks from today, or absolute.andP;  The user can decide whether to allow multipleappointments.andP;  Primetime runs memory-resident.andM;Help for GroupsandM;Syzygy 1.01 from Information Research Corp. focuses on group work.andP;  Althoughits orientation is personal, it provides quick overviews and allowscommunication among group members.andM;Syzygy is a multiuser database of objectives, tasks and related data.andO;Intended for structured information, it divides work into broad objectivesand projects related to each objective.andP;  It then identifies each project'stasks, responsibilities, deadlines and resources.andP;  But it is not dedicatedenough to be called a full-blown project management package.andM;Communication between group members via the electronic-mail facility can bemanual or automatic.andP;  Canned report formats and a project template allow forcustomization.andM;Calendar entries can be created only from tasks, which must be assigned toone person or resource only.andP;  So there is not much flexibility for managingeveryday activities.andP;  Printer support is weak.andM;Who-What-When 1.09 from Chronos Software Inc. has a user interface resemblinga Rolodex card system.andP;  It demands address and other particulars each time anew name is added to the database.andP;  Unlimited free-form notes can attach toeach person's name.andM;Who-What-When displays tasks in week-at-a-glance or day-by-day format.andP;  Thereare three predefined search fields -- a serious limitation compared withother PIMs.andP;  Worse, two simultaneous events cannot be scheduled withoutcreating two separate user names.andM;Who-What-When comes with a binder that serves as a day-timer notebook forpaper information.andM;Ron mileikowsky is a computer consultant in Potomac, Md.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
