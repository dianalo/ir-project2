The Company is an open-end management investment company registeredunder the 1940 Act. The Company is a series company which currently intendsto offer investors a selection of four investment funds (such investmentfunds being referred to individually as a ``Fund'' and in the aggregateas the ``Funds''): the FG Money Fund (the ``No-Load Fund''), the GlobalBond Fund, the Asset Allocation Aggressive Fund, and the Asset AllocationConservative Fund (collectively, the ``Load Funds''). Additional investmentfunds may be added prior to the time the Company's registration statementis declared effective or thereafter. 2. Shares of all of the Funds are distributed by Programs. Financial TrustCompany serves as investment adviser of each Fund. Programs will maintaina continuous public offering of shares of the No-Load Fund at its currentnet asset value without a sales charge (but, as is the case with the LoadFunds, Programs will receive certain fees for distribution services andexpenses pursuant to the Company's distribution plan adopted under Rule12b-1 of the 1940 Act, as described below) and a continuous public offeringof shares of the Load Funds at their respective current net asset valuesplus a sales charge that is expected to equal 4.25% of the public offeringprice (4.4% of the net amount invested). Programs will be paid an annualfee, authorized under a distribution plan adopted under Rule 12b-1 of the1940 Act, for certain services rendered and expenses incurred in connectionwith the offer and sale of the Company's shares. 3. Applicants seek the flexibility to allow shareholders of any No-LoadFund or any Load Fund to exchange all or a portion of their shares (includingshares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and capital gainsdistributions) for shares of any other Fund as specified in the application.4. The Company reserves the right to terminate the exchange privilege ofany shareholder who requests more than 4 exchanges during any one year.The Company would consider exercising its right to terminate the exchangeprivilege of any shareholder who requests more than four exchanges a yearonly where the Company's investment adviser believes such action is necessaryin order to prevent abuse of the exchange privilege to the disadvantageof other shareholders. In particular, the Company is concerned about theadverse impact frequent exchanges of substantial size in and out of thevarious portfolios of the Company could have on effective portfolio managementof each portfolio. Exchanges of a lesser magnitude which (viewed individuallyand without regard to the actions of other shareholders) do not necessitatethe liquidation of portfolio securities in order to fund the request orwhich, in the judgment of the Company's investment adviser, are not likelyto have an adverse impact upon the yield or total return of a portfoliowould not be impeded by the foregoing policy. Accordingly, shareholdersnot making frequent exchanges of substantial blocks of shares will notbe limited in their ability to exercise their exchange privilege as a resultof such policy. 5. Applicants seek the ability to permit the following exchange offersbetween Funds: (i) Shares of a Load Fund may be exchanged for shares of another Load Fundon the basis of relative net asset value without the payment of a salesload; (ii) Shares of a Load Fund may be exchanged for shares of a No-Load Fundon the basis of relative net asset value without the payment of a salesload; and (iii) Shares of a No-Load Fund may be exchanged for shares of any LoadFund subject to the sales load normally charged by the Load Fund (unlessthose shares were previously charged a sales load by one of the Funds).6. It is currently contemplated that exchanges between individuals Fundswould not be subject to the payment of any service charge. However, theCompany reserves the right to impose a nominal administrative fee in thefuture, in an amunt not to exceed $5.00 per exchange, payable to the Fundfrom which the exchange was made and applied uniformly to all shareholders.Any administrative fee imposed would be disclosed in the Company's prospectusand in advertising and sales literature that described the exchange offers.Each exchange will be subject to the minimum investment requirements ofthe Fund's shares that are to be acquired in the exchange.7. In each of the exchanges described above, shares acquired through reinvestmentof dividends and capital gains distributions will be deemed to have beensold with a sales load equal to the sales load previously paid on the shareson which the dividend was paid or distributions made. Moreover, where ashareholder exchanges less than all of his shares of a particular Fund,the shares upon which the highest sales load was previously paid will bedeemed to be exchanged first.8. Applicants submit that the proposed exchange privilege between individualFunds would permit a shareholder of any Fund to exchange, in a simple transaction,his Fund shares for shares of any other Fund on a fair and equitable basiswhen market, tax considerations or changes in the shareholder's investmentobjectives warrant such an exchange. Thus, Applicants believe that theproposed offers of exchange are fair and equitable to all shareholders,while at the same time giving them necessary flexibility in their financialplanning.9. If any administrative fee were to be imposed on exchanges, the purposeof the fee would be to defray the administrative expenses incurred in theexchanges.10. Applicants request that any order issued on the application also beapplicable to any other registered investment company or series thereofdistributed by Programs which may be organized in the future, providedthat the shares of such investment company or series thereof are sold eitherwithout any sales load or with a front-end sales charge in a manner substantiallysimilar to the manner described in the Application.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Conditions</ITAG>1. Shareholders of each Fund will be notified of the exchange privilegeby means of the Company's prospectus and possibly in other communications.2. Shareholders of the Compamy will be notified by means of the Company'sprospectus of the fact that the Company reserves the right to modify orterminate its exchange privilege, including exchanges of shares betweentwo Funds as described more fully in the application.3. In connection with sales literature and advertising that refers to theCompany's exchange privilege, the Company undertakes to consider the desirabilityof disclosing the fact that the Company reserves the right to modify orterminate its exchange privilege.4. Shareholders will be notified in writing at least 60 days prior to anymodification or termination of the Company's exchange privilege, exceptin the case of a reduction of any administrative fee in which case priornotice shall not be required; provided, however, that the temporary cessationof the sale of Company shares under extraordinary circumstances such aswhen the Company is unable to effectively invest amounts in accordancewith applicable investment objectives, policies and restrictions, or thesuspension of the redemption of Company shares pursuant to section 22(e)of the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder shall not be considereda modification or termination of the Company's exchange privilege.5. The Applicants undertake to obtain an amended order from the Commissionprior to any modification (i.e., manner, frequency or basis) or the Company'sexchange privilege in a manner not described in the Application; provided,however, that an amended order is not required in order to terminate theCompany's exchange privilege.6.
