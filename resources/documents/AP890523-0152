One senior official, speaking on condition he not be identified,said the administration expects Wan to call a meeting of thePeople's Congress shortly after his return. The body, which acts asChina's legislature, is sometimes considered a rubber-stamporganization, but it does have the authority to impose or revokemartial law, the official said.   He said Wan was expected to urge the People's Conress to rejectthe use of military force against pro-democracy demonstrators, whohave continued their protest after a government declaration ofmartial law, and to press the body to formally oust Li.   Bush, in his meeting with Wan, repeated his call fornon-violence and asked Wan to end the jamming of Voice of America,according to a White House statement.   Demonstrators in Beijing had been relying heavily on VOAbroadcasts to keep informed during the five weeks of pro-democracyprotests. The jamming, which began Monday, was the first by Chinaof VOA transmissions since before diplomatic relations with theUnited States were restored in 1979.   The White House statement quoted Bush as telling Wan that ``Weare strongly committed to democracy around the world. It is theunderpinning of our being as a nation. I urge non-violence andrestraint in your present situation. I urge that Voice of Americanot be jammed, and that reporters be given open access.''   If extensive force were used to break up the demonstrations,said the U.S. official who spoke only on condition of anonymity,that could put U.S.-Chinese relations in question and endanger thebroad-based economic ties that have been built up over the pastyears of good relations, the official said.   He pointed to the fact that the United States has had noofficial contact with Chinese authorities _ in China _ for nearlytwo days as evidence of continued high-level turmoil, adding thatthe Chinese appear to have shut down all contact with foreigngovernments.   Wan had been expected to remain in the United States severalmore days, but State Department officials were informed he wasreturning late Tuesday.   The Chinese Embassy said that Wan's visit, ``for health reasons,will end earlier than scheduled,'' and that he, his wife anddelegation were returning home. Visits to Florida and New York hadbeen on their original schedule.   The embassy announcement, which did not elaborate on the healthproblem, said the two countries had ``conducted a broad exchange ofviews on international issues and Sino-U.S. bilateral relations ina sincere and friendly atmosphere.''   If Premier Li is removed, that could open the way for CommunistParty chief Zhao Ziyang to assume his duties, the U.S. officialsaid.   Zhao won some favor by meeting with the student hunger strikerslast week and opposing Li's hard-line stance.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who earlier in the daylauded China for ``going in the right direction'' with its economicliberalization, joined Bush and his National Security Adviser BrentScowcroft for the hour-long session with Wan in the Oval Office.   The senior U.S. official who offered the latest analysis said itis likely Wan could organize a delegation of the People's Congressto meet with representatives of the students in order to meet theirdemand for a dialogue with the authorities.   The White House meeting with Wan occurred as the turmoilcontinued in China, where one million people defied martial law fora fifth straight day and filled the streets to demand Li'sresignation.   The demonstration was the strongest public display of wrath yettoward Li, who imposed martial law on Saturday as the student-ledeffort for democratic reforms continued.   Chinese leaders, in particular senior leader Deng Xiaoping,appear to believe that any use of military force to put down thedemonstrations would have to be so extensive that it would benearly impossible to carry out, the official said.   For their part, the students appear to have thwarted awidespread military crackdown by fomenting demonstrations in othercities besides Beijing, thereby weakening the military threat byforcing a dispersal of troop strength, the official said.   On the other hand, China's renewal of television satellitetransmissions is a sign that the power struggle continues and thatLi may be losing ground, the official said.</TEXT></DOC>
