A senior Iranian envoy close to President Hashemi Rafsanjani``recently met with an American personality in Geneva and discussedthe hostage issue with him,'' the daily Al-Qabas said in a dispatchTuesday from Paris.   Rafsanjani and close aides ``are convinced the value of theAmerican and Western hostages is decreasing by the day,'' the papersaid, quoting West European sources it did not identify.   ``The hostages are no longer a pressure or bargaining card,'' itquoted the sources as saying.   No independent confirmation was available, but speculation hasgrown that Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists,wanted the hostages freed as part of an effort to improve relationswith the West.   It appears, however, that Rafsanjani's room for maneuver hasbeen curtailed by a power struggle with former Interior MinisterAli Akbar Mohtashemi, a radical with close links to the LebaneseShiites believed to hold most of the captives.   Eight Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, anItalian and an Irishman are missing in Lebanon and believed heldhostage.   Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,1985.   Al-Qabas said its sources attributed the shift in Iranian policyto the refusal of governments to bargain for the hostages, thechanging political and security situation in Lebanon andinternational developments caused by the changes in Eastern Europe.   ``The Iranian leadership is apparently prepared to facilitatethe release of American hostages provided this will lead at a laterstage to a gradual improvement in Iranian-American relations,'' thepaper reported.   It said the U.S.-Iranian meeting in Geneva was the mostimportant of several, and that the previous encounters took placein Paris and a West German city left unidentified.   None of the officials was identified, but Al-Qabas said theAmericans were diplomats or private citizens and the Iranian inGeneva was ``formerly in charge of the file of Western hostages inLebanon and played a key role in the Iranian-French relations thatled to the release of French hostages.''   Although it quoted the sources as saying they had no ``certaininformation that the two sides have reached a final formula on thefate of the hostages,'' the paper added:   ``The sources do not exclude the possibility of the Americansand Iranians having reached a secret formula whereby the Americanand Western hostages will be freed in one batch or several batches,provided the Bush administration met such a step by opening up toIran and starting a gradual normalization process between the twocountries.''</TEXT></DOC>
