But the Japanese no longer are across-the-board bulls.    Japanese buying has become a major prop in the U.S. bond markets the past few years. In 1986, Japanese investors increased their holdings of foreign bonds $93 billion, compared with $53.5 billion in 1985 and $26.8 billion in 1984, according to Japan's Ministry of Finance. Salomon Brothers Inc. estimates that about three-quarters of 1986's buying was dollar-denominated.    &quot;U.S. bonds haven't lost their attraction,&quot; says Masato Yukawa, a general manager at IBJ Capital Management Co., a unit of the Industrial Bank of Japan. But he warns that because of the dollar's precipitous fall, &quot;Institutions are very afraid of the exchange rate. Japanese life insurance companies have lost twice, this year and last year; that is why they are waiting right now.&quot;    Whether the Japanese remain on the sidelines can have a significant impact on U.S. interest rates, the level of the dollar and U.S. inflation. In the past three years, Japanese dollar investments have helped finance both the U.S. trade and budget deficits.    Investors in Japan fear a renewed collapse of the dollar and rising U.S. interest rates -- both of which would erode any dollar holdings. For the five years ended March 31, currency losses wiped out an estimated 85% of Japanese institutional investors' capital gains on foreign bond holdings, according to the Bank of Japan. Yet many analysts contend that given the size of their portfolios, Japanese institutions wanting to diversify abroad have few choices other than dollar-denominated securities.    &quot;Since the scale of our investments has become so huge, the U.S. dollar is the only currency that is big enough (to absorb) our investments,&quot; says Osamu Sakurai, president of Sumitomo Trust andamp; Banking Co.    Even so, &quot;We want to see the bottom of the decline of the dollar,&quot; says Kinya Hiroi, a first senior executive vice president and chief investment officer for Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. &quot;Every time the dollar looked like it was going to stabilize at a certain level, (Treasury Secretary James) Baker or other officials talked down the dollar. And every time we expected some concrete program by the American authorities to defend the dollar, we were disappointed.&quot;    Mr. Hiroi believes Washington should issue yen-denominated Treasury bonds and increase taxes. The first action would signal a commitment to halt the dollar's long slide, he says; the latter would indicate a willingness to reduce the budget deficit.    Because of worries about the dollar, &quot;Most institutional investors remain on the sidelines,&quot; notes Mr. Hiroi. Dai-Ichi Life had 10 trillion yen (about $68 billion) of assets on a book-value basis at the end of March. Some 19% of the assets were offshore and 68% of those were dollar-denominated.    &quot;People are obviously trying to sniff to see a bottom for the dollar, but an awful lot of Japanese investors got burned very badly,&quot; says Nicholas P. Sargen, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York. Mr. Sargen believes that the dollar will come under renewed selling pressure because of apprehension about inflation and the continued large U.S. trade deficit.    To protect itself, Dai-Ichi Life has been diversifying into British, West German and other European government bonds and selling dollars in the foward foreign exchange market, a move that Dai-Ichi executives say significantly reduces the company's real dollar exposure.    What's more, Japanese money managers are also worried about rising U.S. interest rates. They note that while yields on 30-year Treasurys -- currently about 8.5% -- have fallen from their mid-May highs, they are still above the 7.5% at which they began the year.    But there may be limits to how far Japanese institutions can stray from the dollar. Noting that life insurance company assets are growing at a rate of 20% a year, Ariyoshi Okumura, chief financial economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan, says, &quot;They don't know what to do with the cash.&quot;    Yasukazu Akamatsu, a senior managing director at Daiwa International Capital Management Co., asserts, &quot;The Treasury market is the only one -- besides the Tokyo market -- that can accommodate this amount of money.&quot; In addition, hoards of Japanese corporate cash are currently invested domestically and might be directed overseas.    Not all of Japan's investors are down on U.S. bonds. Several note the relatively low U.S. inflation rate, a growing recognition in Washington that huge budget deficits aren't sustainable, and the fact that since the spring, U.S. officials have stopped jawboning the dollar down.    Moreover, at 8.33%, 10-year Treasurys are yielding 4.36 percentage points more than their Japanese government equivalent. That means that the dollar would have to fall to 96 yen from its current 146.75 yen level before a Japanese buyer lost money on a bond held to maturity.    A week and a half ago-before last week's huge sell-off in the Japanese bond market -- the spread between Treasurys and Japanese government bonds was as wide as 5.9 percentage points. Some analysts attributed the narrowing differential to Japanese investors' renewed interest in U.S. bonds. &quot;Our markets have rallied while the German, British and Japanese bond markets have all sold off,&quot; notes Mr. Sargen. But he warns: &quot;The situation could reverse itself if the dollar were sold off.&quot;    With such interest rate differentials and &quot;the dollar already having fallen, U.S. government securities are more attractive than two years ago,&quot; says Tokutaro Hirose, an executive vice president at Nippon Life Insurance Co. Noting that the dollar has declined about 100 yen in the past two years, Mr. Hirose doubts it &quot;will fall another 100 yen.&quot;    In the year ended March 31, Nippon Life invested about $3 billion overseas. Roughly 60% was dollar-denominated, 20% was in Canadian currency, a little less than 10% in Australian, and the rest in European currencies. In the same period, the firm also attributed a 511 billion yen (about $3.5 billion) loss to currency movements. Nonetheless, &quot;We've gotten much higher interest rates than by investing in our own country,&quot; says Mr. Hirose. &quot;So from a long-term investment view, our calculation is correct.&quot;    A further measure of Japan's appetite for U.S. government securities will come at the U.S. Treasury's quarterly refunding in August. &quot;Regardless of the yield situation,&quot; says Noboru Irie, president of New Japan Securities Co., &quot;the question of whether (the Japanese) invest or not depends on the dollar-yen relationship. Investors should have confidence the dollar won't come down in the future.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
