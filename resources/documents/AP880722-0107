(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mormon Church officials must disclosewhether a member confessed to molesting children years before hisarrest, an appeals court ruled.   The ruling Thursday came in a lawsuit filed against the Churchof Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints by the mother of a child thechurch member admitted molesting.   The suit claims Kenneth Ray told three bishops as early as 1968that he had been having sexual contact with children. The suit saidthe church failed to report Ray to state authorities until 1984,leaving children vulnerable to abuse.   Ray was excommunicated by the church in 1984 for conductunbecoming a member and later pleaded no contest to child molesting.   Cynthia Brown, who sued Ray, Ray's former wife and the MormonChurch seeking unspecified damages on her daughter's behalf, soughtto force the bishops to disclose whether Ray told them he had beensexually abusing children.   The church objected, saying the bishops were protected by theclergyman-penitent privilege.   Superior Court Judge Cheryl Hendrix ordered the bishops to givedepositions, and the Arizona Court of Appeals agreed Thursday.   The appellate court, in a 3-0 decision, said Ray had waived hisprivilege by disclosing to police what he had told the bishops.   A Mormon Church official in Mesa, David Udall, declined commenton the ruling, saying he had not read it.</TEXT></DOC>
