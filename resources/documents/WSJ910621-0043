The BAT uses acoustic and infrared sensors to find movingtanks and other armored vehicles deep in enemy territory, anArmy spokesman said. It will ride as a passenger in the noseof either the Stealth missile or the Army Tactical Missile.When over the target, the missile will disperse the BATbomblets simultaneously over several different targets.</LP><TEXT>   The BAT's key tactical advantage is that it can be used toattack tanks far behind enemy lines without risking aircraftand their crews.   Northrop said the development phase of the BAT program isscheduled to run four years. Northrop's current work force of250 at its Electronic Systems Division in Hawthorne, Calif.,is expected to grow to 500, a company spokesman said.
