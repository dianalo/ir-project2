A fifth member of the Palestinian guerrilla band escaped andsoldiers were searching for him in an area about three miles northof the border, a military source said on condition of anonymity.   An army spokesman said the guerrillas belonged to the radical PLOfaction Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and werecaught near Al Jibbayn village in Israel's self-proclaimed``security zone.'' Lebanese police said the encounter occurredoutside the zone.   Israel established the buffer, which ranges from six to 10 milesdeep north of the border, in June 1985 after withdrawing most of itstroops to end a three-year invasion and occupation of Lebanon. Thezone is patrolled by Israeli soldiers and a surrogate Lebanesemilitia.   ``From documents and papers, it was established that theterrorists (intended) to carry out an attack in one of thesettlements in the north'' of Israel, the army said in a statement.   Democratic Front statements issued in Lebanon and Syria claimedits men attacked Israeli troops in retaliation for an Israeli airraid Tuesday on one of its bases in the Chouf Mountains southeast ofBeirut.   It pledged increased attacks on Israel despite PLO chief YasserArafat's renunciation of terrorism, which the statement said did notapply to the Front.   Lebanese police said the four guerrillas were killed in a battlewith Israeli soldiers and their South Lebanon Army militia alliesnear Majdel Zoun village, 14 miles southeast of Tyre and just northof the security zone.   This was the second infiltration attempt in a week Israel hasblamed on the Democratic Front. The army reported Feb. 23 thatsoldiers had killed three of the organization's guerrillas in thesecurity zone.   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, chief of the army's Northern Command, toldIsrael radio leaflets found on the men killed Thursday referred to``carrying out a hostage-taking mission in Israel.''   Foreign Ministry officials gave reporters copies of DemocraticFront identification cards they said belonged to two of the threeguerrillas killed Feb. 23 and also provided a copy of anArabic-language leaflet one of the men allegedly carried.   Anti-Israeli statements were in the leaflet, but no clues to thegroup's mission.   Marwan Hussein Khawaz, 24, was the Palestinian shot and killedThursday in the Gaza Strip. The army said he tried to stab a soldierduring house searches overnight.   At least 388 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip since an uprising began nearly 15 months ago.Seventeen Israelis also have been slain.   Arab reports said six Palestinians were wounded in Gaza and theWest Bank during stone-throwing confrontations with soldiers.Hospital officials in Gaza City said a seventh Palestinian,50-year-old Fatima Kdaih of the Jabaliya refugee camp, lost herright eye when she was hit by a rubber bullet.   Soldiers kept a curfew on Nablus, the West Bank's largest city,for the seventh conecutive day, confining nearly all its 120,000residents to their homes. The curfew was imposed last Friday after asoldier was killed by a concrete block dropped from a third-storywindow.   In the West Bank, the army destroyed five houses and sealedanother that belonged to members of an Arab group accused of killinga Palestinian who cooperated with Israeli authorities, the militaryspokesman said.   The army said two other houses were destroyed that belonged to asecond Palestinian group suspected of throwing firebombs at Israelimilitary patrols and the houses of Palestinian collaborators.   Israel's desire to end U.S. talks with the Palestine LiberationOrganization, which it considers a terrorist organization, is likelyto be reinforced by the latest infiltration attempt.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said in a television interviewThursday that he would try to convince the United States to end itstalks with the PLO when he visits New York and Washington next week.   The United States opened the dialogue in Tunis, where the PLO hasits headquarters, after Arafat publicly renounced terrorism inDecember and recognized Israel's right to exist.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday theUnited States had told the PLO ``attacks against Israeli civilianand military targets inside or outside Israel are contrary to theobjectives of the dialogue.''</TEXT></DOC>
