The Environmental Protection Agency is being forced by afederal court to re-examine plans to ban asbestos car brakesby 1997. At issue is whether sparing those who make or repairbrakes from exposure to the hazardous fiber might create asafety risk for motorists.   &quot;Do you kill people with asbestos 30 years later, or doyou have them wipe out in traffic accidents because thebrakes didn't work?&quot; says Gilbert Laycock, executive directorof a trade group of brake-lining manufacturers.   The EPA must reassess studies, cited by the court, thatquestion the safety of replacement brakes made withnon-asbestos substitutes, especially on cars designed forasbestos brakes. Non-asbestos brakes have been found toperform differently at various speeds and in various weatherconditions, reducing reliability, locking up or vibrating. Amajority of cars on the road -- about 150 million -- stillrely on heat-resistant asbestos brake linings or pads.   There is less concern over new cars, more than half ofwhich are already asbestos-free. Car makers are redesigningtheir brake systems, such as with anti-lock devices, toadjust for the inconsistencies of such substitutes as glass,mineral wool or ceramic fibers. Also, brakes on new cars mustmeet federal test standards; replacements don't have to.   Ridding repair shops and brake factories of asbestosfibers, blamed for fatal diseases such as lung cancer, wouldsave 152 lives over 13 years, the EPA has estimated. But ArneAnderson, a former Ford Motor engineer and consultant onbrake and friction materials, says the nearly completedtransition to non-asbestos brakes on 18-wheel trucks alreadyhas led to more highway deaths than the EPA hopes to preventover the 13 years.   While the EPA decides how to proceed in its legal case,asbestos brakes will stay on the market. Experts such as Mr.Anderson urge consumers to replace their worn brakes withexact matches.                                                                                                          States Rake Utilities   Over Their Local Coals                                                                                                          LAWMAKERS in Washington wrote the new acid-rain law to letdirty utilities decide for themselves how to clean up theirpollution. But states aren't being so reticent.   Fearing the loss of mining jobs, some states are handingout incentives and orders to keep utilities burning localcoal -- even at the expense of adding smoke-stack scrubbers-- instead of switching to cleaner, lower-sulfur coal fromout of state.   Illinois Power is getting a special $35 million stategrant. In exchange, it must install scrubbers on twocoal-fired units at its Baldwin power plant near St. Louis.While the Decatur, Ill., utility had been consideringscrubbers anyway, Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison had been&quot;actively looking&quot; at switching to cleaner out-of-state coal,a spokesman says. Now, it must install two scrubbers at itsKincaid Station facility, near Springfield, Ill. In exchange,it gets to pass along certain coal-transportation costs thatit couldn't previously include in its fuel costs.   In Ohio, American Electric Power is being told by thestate Public Utilities Commission to keep open the option ofinstalling scrubbers at its massive Gavin plant in thesoutheastern part of the state. It's also being directed totake job losses into account when deciding whether to scrubor switch fuels. Ohio also is offering a tax credit of $1 foreach ton of Ohio coal burned at facilities that use at least80% Ohio coal.   In Indiana, utilities that use less Indiana coal as aresult of the federal law must spell out the job lossesresulting from their intended action in a filing with thestate. Measures to encourage scrubbing are expected to comeup elsewhere next year.                                                                                                          Firms Seek Tax Breaks   For Fighting Pollution                                                                                                          THE RECESSION and competitiveness worries stir up talk oftax breaks for polluters who try to clean up their acts.   The research arm of the American Council for CapitalFormation, a corporate-funded education and lobbying group,wants special tax treatment for pollution-controlinvestments, to improve both the environment and the economy.   The group wants the financial aid for anti-pollutionefforts because it worries that environmental regulations areforcing U.S. companies to put too much capital intocontrolling air, water and solid-waste pollution and notenough into modernizing or expanding their industries andspurring economic growth.   A study found that such competitors as Germany, Japan,France, Canada and Taiwan let companies write offpollution-control costs faster and more fully. While foreigncompanies may get to recover at least 80% ofpollution-control investments in three years or less, mostU.S. firms in three years can recover only 56.3%, or 21% ifsubject to the alternative minimum tax.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          OIL AND AUTO interests trade swipes over whether the EPA,in a rule due to be proposed by Friday, should require $40canisters on new cars to catch refueling vapors. Oilcompanies favor the canisters over special gas-pump nozzles;car makers say the canisters could catch fire. . . . TheInterior Department says 41% of the 581 plants and animals onits list of endangered or threatened species in the U.S. arestable or increasing in number; 38% are in decline; thestatus of 19% is unknown; and 2% are believed extinct.</TEXT></DOC>
