(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A relief organization said it would senda medical team and 80,000 pounds of supplies toearthquake-devastated Iran on Saturday, a gesture it hopes willimprove relations between Americans and Iranians.   ``We really can't be perceived as so bad if we reach out to thepeople there,'' said Terry Tarnowski, who has worked for AmeriCaressince it was founded in 1982.   The politics of a country don't affect the organization's work,said spokesman Dwain Schenck on Friday.   ``If you're a relief group worth your salt, you'll try to reactand not let past problems get in the way,'' Schenck said bytelephone from the New Canaan headquarters of AmeriCares.   Rescuers freed thousands of people Friday from buildingsflattened by the earthquake in northern Iran. Iranian officials atthe United Nations said at least 40,000 were killed and 100,000injured.   The government appealed for international help.   AmeriCares wasn't the only U.S. organization helping with therelief effort on Friday. The American Red Cross said it was raisingmoney, rather than shipping supplies, and the Iranian AmericanRepublican Council was readying boxes of blankets and medicalsupplies.   Volunteers at the AmeriCares warehouse in Stamford on Fridayhelped prepare hundreds of boxes of supplies, which were loadedonto two tractor-trailer trucks and shipped to Bradley Airport inWindsor Locks.   A chartered airplane carrying at least one doctor and nurse, aswell as AmeriCares workers and volunteers, was scheduled to departfrom Bradley at noon on Saturday, said another AmeriCaresspokesman, Steve Norman.   The airplane will be ``packed to the gills'' with a variety ofsupplies, Schenck said.   Among the items were shovels, bandages, ibuprofen, burn cream,blankets, thermometers, bedspreads, cotton balls, surgical gloves,plastic water pitchers and cups, plastic utensils, disinfectant,intravenous catheters and even spaghetti.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITORS: AmeriCares line for donations is 1-800-486-4357.</TEXT></DOC>
