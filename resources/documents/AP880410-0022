(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It was bad enough when they convictedKermit's police chief for selling drugs and the fire chief forsetting fires, along with other members of their clan. Then theformer county sheriff admitted he sold his job to the highestbidder.   And last week, a special grand jury returned indictmentscharging 16 of Mingo County's most prominent politicians _including state legislators, a prosecutor and the mayor of thecounty seat _ with bribery and conspiracy to subvert free electionsin Mingo County.   The grand jury, one of three convened as part of a special stateand federal task force investigating corruption in the county, isnot yet finished. Circuit Judge Dan O'Hanlon, brought in fromanother county, says the grand jury will remain empaneled throughJuly and will be in session on Election Day to hear any complaintsof vote fraud.   In all, some 60 people from Mingo County have been convicted onstate or federal charges in the past two years. The investigationsstarted separately, with the federal government breaking a drug andarson ring that operated openly in the tiny town of Kermit. At theother end of the county, the state tackled allegations of votefraud in Gilbert's municipal elections.   Investigators started bumping into one another. The deeper theylooked, the more pervasive the corruption seemed. Mingo County'selections became the joke of the day in West Virginia: ``What doyou call a voter in Mingo County? An unindicted co-conspirator.''   Other West Virginians have long liked to poke fun at MingoCounty, which dubs itself ``The Heart of the Billion-DollarCoalfield.'' Far from being central to the state, however, itslocation on the southwestern border with Kentucky is isolated, deepin the heart of Appalachia. And although mining has scarred thelandscape, it remains a land of narrow, winding valleys separatedby steep wooded ridges.   The isolation has had its darker side, and the region was knownfor years as ``bloody Mingo.'' It first hit newspaper front pagesin the 19th century, when the Hatfield clan feuded in pitchedbattles with the McCoy clan from across the border in Kentucky.   These days the boom and bust cycles of the coalfield economystill dominate most lives in Mingo, and the economy has been bustsince the early 1980s.   The area's poverty and isolation allowed corruption to flourish,according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Savage, who heads thefederal side of the investigation.   Savage points out that of the county's 36,000 residents, only8,700 have jobs. And of those 8,700 jobs, he says, more than 2,600are controlled by politicians _ the school board, the countycommission, the anti-poverty agencies. As a result, he says, manypeople feel they must vote the way they're told by the politicianswho control their livelihood.   ``You can't assess fault on the people of Mingo County,'' saysSavage. ``People anywhere could find themselves in this situationif conditions were right.''   The linchpin to the latest indictments was Johnie Owens, aformer county Democratic chairman and one-time sheriff. He said heaccepted a $20,000 downpayment on a $100,000 bribe from the currentsheriff, Charles E. ``Eddie'' Hilbert, then persuaded the threecounty commissioners to accept his resignation and appoint Hilbertin exchange for half the bribe.   Those county commissioners, one of whom is now a state senator,were among those indicted last week. The grand jury also accused 15politicians of conspiring with Owens, as Democratic chairman, toimproperly influence elections and buy votes.   Hilbert is scheduled to enter a plea in federal court April 18.He was indicted in January on 13 counts, including allegations thathe protected the drug and arson ring in Kermit in exchange forillegal campaign contributions.   That ring showed that while the days of the Hatfields and McCoysare long over, clans still play a role in the region.   Among those from Kermit who were sentenced to lengthy prisonterms were Fire Chief Wilburn ``Wig'' Preece, his wife, six oftheir 14 children and their son-in-law, Police Chief David Ramey.</TEXT></DOC>
