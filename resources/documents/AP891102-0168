SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Pentagon said on Thursday that it informedCongress of a $3.1 billion arms purchase by Saudi Arabia, touchingoff a 30-day period in which Capitol Hill can reject the deal.   The sale, which was reported in the media several weeks ago, hastouched off little opposition among lawmakers.   In the past, Congress has rejected several U.S. arms sales toArab countries out of concern for Israel's security.   But political maneuvering in recent weeks managed to diffuse theconcerns that customarily touch off strong opposition to U.S. dealswith Arab countries technically at war with Israel.   ``The sale of this equipment and support will not affect thebasic military balance in the region,'' the Pentagon said in astatement.   It includes 315 M1A2 tanks, but two-thirds of the price tag _which is equivalent to a year's U.S. aid to Israel _ is the cost ofequipment and ammunition, including huge trucks to transport anytanks that break down.   The sale also includes the design and construction ofmaintenance facilities for the vehicles, the Pentagon said.   The statement did not say where the tanks would be based.   Several House members have written Secretary of State James A.Baker III asking further consultations and raising some questionsabout the sale, and Baker promised to provide assurances the armswere necessary for the Saudi defense.   With the formal notification, Congress has 30 days either tokill the deal by majority votes in the Senate and House or let itgo through.   The Saudis are to receive the tanks beginning in the middle ofthe next decade, about the same time the U.S. Army would fieldthem. Israel has a comparable tank, the Merkava.   To smooth congressional approval, the Bush administration agreednot to equip the Saudi tanks with plates of uranium armor, a muchdenser metal than steel.   If some are deployed at the Tabuk military base the tanks wouldbe only 120 miles from Israel. Others may be based near Kuwait, andstill others at an armored training school near Mecca.</TEXT></DOC>
