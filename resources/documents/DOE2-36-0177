Assuming s-wave and d-wave symmetries for these states, we derivea Ginzburg-Landau free-energy expression which couples s- and d-wavestates and is rotationally invariant, in contrast to the free-energyexpression proposed by P. Kumar and P. Woelfle [Phys. Rev. Lett. 59,1954 (1987)]. We discuss in detail the consequences that follow fromour free-energy relation. In particular, we predict that in the abovesystem there are two eigenfrequencies associated with the dynamics ofphase oscillations (internal Josephson effect) which are characteristicof the s-wave and d-wave states.</TEXT></DOC>
