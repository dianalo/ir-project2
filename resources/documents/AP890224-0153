The soldier, identified as Binyamin Meisner, 24, was the sixthmember of Israel's armed forces to be killed since the uprisingbegan in December 1987. A total of 17 Israelis and at least 385Palestinians have been killed.   Israel radio and television said Palestinians provoked soldiersby throwing stones and lured them into one of the narrow alleys ofthe city's open air market.   The large block was then dropped and hit Meisner, who was wearinga steel helmet. After Meisner was hit, troops opened fire, said aNablus army commander who was not identified further.   The army imposed a curfew on Nablus' 120,000 residents and beganhouse-to-house searches, and sporadic gunfire was heard, Arabreports said.   In the Gaza Strip, nine Palestinians were wounded in clashes withtroops, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was checkingthe reports.   The hospital officials said the wounded included a 30-year-oldwoman who was nine months pregnant. Doctors said she was shot in theback but was not in serious condition. They said a 4-year-old boywas shot in the right arm.   Bassam Abu Sharif, PLO chief Yasser Arafat's political adviser,said in an interview published Friday he was trying to arrange ameeting with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in London.   Abu Sharif, speaking in an interview with the Israeli newspaperYediot Ahronot in London, said he was ``working through Britishpolitical figures in the Conservative Party to arrange a meetingwith Rabin who will visit London.''   ``If I meet him I will ask him `Why do you shoot children'?'' AbuSharif said. ``He will of course ask me, `Why are you rioting'?''   Rabin has met extensively with Palestinian officials in theoccupied lands, but, in line with government policy, has said hewould not negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization.   Rabin has left for a fund-raising tour in Switzerland and wasscheduled to go to London before returning to Israel next week, saida Defense Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Recent polls have indicated the majority of Israelis supportnegotiations with the PLO under certain conditions.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Friday reiterated his oppositionto talks with the PLO, saying the organization was still intent ondestroying Israel.   Shamir also rejected a demand by Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze that Israel agree to talks with the PLO and aninternational Middle East peace conference as the price of renewingdiplomatic ties.   ``We will not accept any conditions for the resumption ofrelations,'' Shamir told a news conference after a three-day visitto France. ``As long as the Soviet Union doesn't renew ties withIsrael, from our view it cannot be involved in any way in the peaceprocess in the region.''   The statement appeared to contradict an earlier one by ForeignMinister Moshe Arens who said after a meeting with Shevardnadze hebelieved the Soviets could play a role in Middle East peacemakingeven without diplomatic ties with Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
