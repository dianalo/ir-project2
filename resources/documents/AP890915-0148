But conservative Democrats said their leaders were choosing thewrong issue _ and Republicans eagerly tried to exploit the rift inthe majority party's ranks.   In a 19-17 vote on Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committeeapproved a capital gains tax cut after six Democrats defected andwent against their party to side with the president.   Democratic leaders on Friday made clear that they would take thefight to the full House, and that they hoped the public would be ontheir side after deciding who would win and who would lose if thetax cut is approved.   They said they hadn't settled on what kind of alternative tooffer, but among the possibilities was including a restoration ofIndividual Retirement Account tax breaks as first proposed by Sen.Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.   The issue has emerged as the thorniest in a massive budget billthat also includes the sensitive issues of child care and revisionof the tax for Medicare catastrophic illness coverage.   Strategists involved in the situation were pondering thepossibility that the whole bill might collapse if forces opposed tovarious provisions combined to bring it down.   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., chairman of the House Democratic Caucus,said the cut was ``at the wrong time giving relief to the wrongpeople. It's obviously a benefit that will be largely enjoyed by the150-to-200-thousand-plus crowd.''   Reminded that Michael Dukakis tried unsuccessfully to make acampaign issue out of Bush's support of a capital gains cut, Hoyerstill said, ``My gut tells me the average American agrees with ourposition.''   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who ran for theDemocratic presidential nomination last year based on populistthemes, was leading the rhetorical attack for the Democratic leaders.   ``George Bush wants to give a tax cut to the wealthy, and sendthe bill to average working Americans,'' he said.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., facing the toughest testyet of his three-month-old tenure, put his deputies to work craftingan alternative to offer on the House floor when debate begins laterthis month.   But Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., who co-sponsored the version of thecapital gains cut approved by the committee, said it wasn't justRepublicans who thought the proposal was a good one for alltaxpayers, one that would spur investment and improve the economy.   His own party's leaders, he said, were making a ``terriblemistake'' by portraying capital gains as a partisan issue. ``Ifenough Democrats will continue to support it and get out front, wecan save the party from itself,'' he said.   Republicans saw the Democratic division as a return to thepolitics early in President Reagan's first term, when Republicanscould team up with ``Boll Weevil'' Southern Democrats to pushthrough parts of the president's program.   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House Minority Whip, spoke Fridayof ``the common sense coalition of Democrats and Republicans.''   He and Hoyer both said there would be a tough fight on the Housefloor.   The capital gains plan approved Thursday would cut the currentmaximum rate of 33 percent to 19.6 percent for 27 months.Thereafter, the rate would rise to 28 percent but any gains would betaxed only on the amount exceeding the annual inflation rate.   Bush, in his campaign, promised to fight for a 15 percent rate,but the net effect on taxpayers of the House proposal is similar tothat because of the indexing for inflation. The White Houseimmediately announced the president would fight for thecommittee-approved plan.   The fight is likely to be a muddy one, because the capital gainsprovision is part of a huge budget bill that includes some of thisyear's toughest issues _ with more battles almost certain on eachone.   The bill would provide lower-income families additional taxcredits and state-administered grants to help working parents findchild care. Liberals and conservatives want to move the finalversion in opposite directions.   In response to a rash of complaints, the bill would halve thesurtax financing catastrophic health insurance for the wealthiest 40percent of retirees, but the flat monthly premium paid by all butthe poorest Medicare beneficiaries would rise.   The bill would allow retirees to turn down catastrophic coveragebut only if they opt out of Medicare Part B, which pays physicians'fees.   But many in Congress want to repeal the law altogether, and theshowdown on that issue could come on this bill.   Other issues include new restrictions on ``dial-a-porn''telephone services, on the Fairness Doctrine to require broadcastersto give time to opposing views, on expansion of the Medicaid healthprogram for the poor, and a variety of new tax provisions affectingbusinesses.</TEXT></DOC>
