<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-93-1038 </DOCNO><TEXT>The governmental wind energy programme in Denmark (start in 1977) focussedon development, construction and operation of large-scale wind powerplants with special reference to studies on wind availability, site conditions,power supply to the national grid and technological issues of plant design.The author reports on the design and output characteristics of differentwind turbines which comprise the plant at Nibe (1265/3427 MWh), a 60m/2 MW wind turbine, a plant at Esbjerg (annual energy production atfavourable wind conditions up to 4 GWh), and the wind farm in Masnedo(40 m rotors, 6 kV-generator/750 kW, wind-converter-tower height 45 m,annual power production up to 7.5 GWh). Private companies built a numberof medium-power-range wind power plants. 'Wind energy current' is plannedto be fed into the national grid (map showing wind power plant sites).(HWJ)</TEXT></DOC>
