Currey, who leads the group that agreed to buy Greyhound Lines Inc., and representatives of the bus company's union said they reached a tentative labor agreement.    Both parties said the pact promises workers job security, incentive pay and eased work rules in exchange for a cut in the mileage rate paid to drivers.    If ratified by members of the Amalgamated Transit Union, the proposed three-year contract would remove Mr. Currey's first obstacle to reviving the bus line, which has been forced to trim service to keep up with a drastic decline in ridership.    The proposed agreement, which covers about 8,000 bus drivers, maintenance workers and office personnel, reduces the mileage rate paid to drivers, but changes work rules to permit them to drive more miles during a work shift. &quot;This is a productivity improvement,&quot; said Mr. Currey's spokesman. &quot;It doesn't mean longer hours, and it's still within government safety regulations.&quot;    The proposal also guarantees job security during the life of the contract for Greyhound's full-time employees and promises bus drivers incentive bonuses tied to increased passsenger traffic in each of the company's four regional divisions.    Mr. Currey, who is chairman of closely held BusLease Inc., Dallas, led a group of investors that agreed to buy the bus line from Phoenix, Ariz.-based Greyhound Corp. for $350 million in cash and securities. The sale is expected to close March 19. The new contract, if ratified, will become effective at that time. </TEXT></DOC>
