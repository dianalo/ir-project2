Robert Dole, probably signaling the demise of his presidential quest, laid off more than half of his campaign staff and canceled all advertising scheduled to run in Illinois.    Although Dole campaign officials wouldn't say this means the Republican presidential candidate intends to withdraw from the race, the actions probably eliminate any hope he has of winning the Illinois primary next Tuesday. And even his supporters acknowledge that a loss in Illinois on the heels of Vice President George Bush's near sweep of Super Tuesday primaries this week would doom the Dole candidacy.    &quot;He's not pulling out,&quot; insisted Dale Tate, a campaign spokeswoman. But Sen. Dole himself suggested the Kansas Republican was considering leaving the race, and campaign insiders acknowledged that the issue was being discussed.    A spokeswoman said the Dole campaign cut more than half of its staff both in field operations and in Washington. &quot;I can't answer exactly how many, because we are still in the process, but it will be a significant cutback,&quot; she said.    The campaign had planned to spend a half-million dollars on commercials in Illinois, and some of them had already run, according to another campaign official. He declined to say how much the campaign was saving by pulling the ads.    Dole campaign aides suggested the moves were necessary because of budget considerations, and they left open the possibility that they still would air some television advertisements in Illinois. They argued that the senator intended to press on with his campaign, and that he planned a full schedule of campaign events for today, including an endorsement from Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois.    &quot;We are reassessing our media strategy,&quot; Ms. Tate said. &quot;We could buy a chunk of air time or run print ads.&quot;    The decisions came as ABC News reported that the vice president held a 2-to-1 lead over Sen. Dole in Illinois. They followed several days of debate within the Dole campaign about the sort of campaign that Mr. Dole, who failed to carry any of the 17 Super Tuesday states this week, should conduct.    Meanwhile, Rep. Jack Kemp, as expected, formally withdrew from the presidential race. Rep. Kemp, who failed to break into the top tier of GOP candidates, declined to endorse any of the remaining contenders. But he left open the possibility that he would accept an invitation to run for vice president on the eventual Republican ticket.    Rep. Kemp also said he wouldn't seek re-election to the House from his district in the suburbs of Buffalo, N.Y. </TEXT></DOC>
