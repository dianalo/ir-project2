The Committee for Economic Development, composed of executivesfrom some of the country's top corporations, issued a reportThursday that charged that the bipartisan budget agreement betweenPresident Bush and Congress ``dodged the important budgetary issuesand made little substantive and lasting improvement in the outlookfor the deficit.''   That agreement, covering the fiscal year which begins Oct. 1, isdesigned to meet the legal target of reducing the budget deficitfrom an expected $150 billion this year down to $100 billion in 1990.   But the committee's report charged that more than one-third ofthe projected savings in the bipartisan agreement were composed of``one-time savings, accounting gimmicks and other smoke and mirrorsthat merely improve the appearances of the budget.''   The report, titled ``Battling America's Budget Deficits,'' alsocalled for trimming Social Security and Medicare, saying thatsignificant deficit reductions could not be made unless these hugemiddle-class entitlement programs were scaled back.   Roy Ash, head of the Office of Management and Budget in the Nixonadministration and a member of the panel which prepared the CEDreport, said that official Washington was currently ``obfuscating,misleading and deceiving the public'' about the deficit crisisfacing the country.   The committee proposed a program to trim the deficit by $40billion to $50 billion each year through a combination of budgetcuts and unspecified tax hikes. Members of the group said they tookno stand on which taxes to increase because they could not reachconsensus, although some said they favored creation of aconsumption-based tax such as the Value Added Tax used by manyEuropean nations.   The recommendations of the group were being presented to OMBDirector Richard Darman and congressional budget leaders, accordingto Robert Holland, president of the CED and a former member of theFederal Reserve Board.   Holland complained that the country's deficit woes were not asdominant in the news currently as they were a few years ago, eventhough the problem is far from being solved.   ``The deficit problem today rarely makes front page news,'' hesaid. ``The result is that few people care deeply about the issueand our political system feels little pressure to tackle iteffectively.''   The Committe for Economic Development is a non-profit researchgroup composed of 250 business and education leaders.</TEXT></DOC>
