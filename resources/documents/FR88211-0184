TheDecision relates to a Consent Order entered into by the DOE and the AtlanticRichfield Company (ARCO) which settled a comprehensive list of issues pertainingto ARCO's compliance with the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulationsduring the period January 1, 1973, through January 27, 1981 (consent orderperiod). A Proposed Decision and Order tentatively establishing refundprocedures and soliciting comments from the public concerning the distributionof the ARCO consent order funds was issued on June 26, 1986. 51 FR 24206(July 2, 1986).The Decision sets forth procedures and standards which the DOE has formulatedin order to distribute the contents of the escrow account funded by ARCOpursuant to the Consent Order. The escrow funds associated with ARCO'salleged refined product violations, $46,387,975.26, plus interest, willbe used to provide restitution to individuals and firms that purchasedrefined covered products sold by ARCO during the period March 6, 1973,through January 27, 1981. The remainder of the escrow funds, $21,647,540.36,plus interest, will be disbursed in accordance with the DOE's ModifiedStatement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, <T3>See</T3> 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1987), using the procedures describedin <T3>A. Tarricone, Inc., et al.,</T3> 15 DOE andpara;85,495 (1987).As the accompanying Decision and Order indicates, Applications for Refundmay now be filed by purchasers of refined covered products sold by ARCOduring the period March 6, 1973, through January 27, 1981. Applicationswill be accepted provided they are filed in duplicate and postmarked byAugust 31, 1988.

On July 30, 1985, ERA filed aPetition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures in connectionwith a June 27, 1985 Consent Order between Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO)and the DOE.I. BackgroundDuring the period of federal petroleum price and allocation controls, ARCOwas engaged in the production, importation, sale, and refining of crudeoil; the sale of residual fuel oil, motor gasoline, middle distillates,aviation fuel, propane, and other refined petroleum products; and the extraction,fractionation, and sale of natural gas liquids and natural gas liguid products.The firm was therefore subject to the Mandatory Petroleum Price and AllocationRegulations set forth at 6 CFR Part 150 and 10 CFR Parts 210, 211, and212. After an extensive audit of ARCO's operations, ERA alleged that thefirm had violated applicable DOE pricing and allocation regulations inits sales of covered products.On January 23, 1985, ERA and ARCO signed a Proposed Consent Order settlinga comprehensive list of issues pertaining to ARCO's compliance with thefederal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period, January1, 1973, through January 27, 1981 (consent order period). 50 FR. 8366 (March1, 1985). Under the terms of the Proposed Consent Order, ARCO agreed toremit a total of $65,700,000, plus interest, to the DOE \1\<NOTE/> and ERA agreed not to pursue its allegations regarding ARCO'scompliance with the DOE regulations, with the exception of certain issuesenumerated in the Proposed Consent Order. <T3>See</T3> Proposed Consent Order, andpara; 501, 50 FR. 8732 (March 1,1985). The Proposed Consent Order specifically stated that ``[e]xecutionof this Consent Order constitutes neither an admission by ARCO nor a findingby DOE of any violation by ARCO of any statute or regulation.'' ProposedConsent Order, andpara; 506, 50 FR. 8373 (March 1, 1985). On June 27, 1985,the DOE finalized the ARCO Consent Order, with only minor technical modifications.\2\<NOTE/>  50 FR 26603 (June 27, 1885).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Upon signing the Proposed Consent Order, ARCO deposited$65,700,000 into an interest-bearing escrow account administered by theBank of America, pending completion of the public comment period and finalizationof the Consent Order.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ At the same time, ARCO transferred $68,035,515.62, includinginterest, to the DOE.On June 26, 1986, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDandamp;O) settingforth a tentative plan for the distribution of the ARCO consent order funds.51 FR. 24206 (July 2, 1986). In this Decision and Order, we will addressthe comments which were submitted in response to the PDandamp;O and willadopt final refund procedures. In addition, we will provide a suggestedrefund application format in order to assist individuals and firms in makingclaims.II. Summary of Proposed Refund ProceduresAs we indicated in the PDandamp;O, the ARCO Consent Order resolved allegedregulatory violations involving the sale of both refined covered products\3\<NOTE/> and crude oil. Therefore, we proposed to divide the escrowfunds into two pools.\4\<NOTE/> Because the record indicated that approximately 68.182 percentof the alleged overcharges resolved by the Consent Order occurred in ARCO'ssales of refined products, we proposed that 68.182 percent of the consentorder funds be made available for distribution to individuals and firmsthat were injured by their purchase of ARCO refined covered products duringthe period March 6, 1973, through January 27, 1981 (refund period).\5\<NOTE/> We also proposed that the remaining 31.818 percent of theescrow fund be set aside as a pool of crude oil monies.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ For the purposes of this Decision, the term ``refinedcovered products'' includes all covered products other than crude oil.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The PDandamp;O explained that any crude oil overchargeswould have been dispersed throughout the domestic refining industry throughthe operation of the DOE Entitlements Program, and that as a policy matterthe DOE had decided that direct restitution for these alleged overchargeswas impractical. We proposed to distribute the ARCO crude oil funds inaccordance with the DOE's Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude OilCases (SRP). 50 Fed Reg. 27400 (July 2, 1985). Under the SRP, all fundsreceived in crude oil cases were to be held in escrow pending Congressionalaction. However, if Congress did not act by the autumn of 1986, crude oilfunds were to be paid into the U.S. Treasury.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Except for the first ten days of 1973, no ARCO productswere ``covered'' by mandatory controls until March 6, 1973. Because refundsin this type of case are only warranted for purchases of regulated products,the refund period begins on this date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ In the PDandamp;O, we applied the 31.818 percent figureto $65,700,000, the ARCO consent order amount, and produced a crude oilsum of $20,904,426. However, this calculation should have been based on$68,035,515.62, the total amount of money that ARCO eventually remittedto the DOE. Using this figure, the crude oil portion of the ARCO consentorder funds is $21,647,540.36 (0,31818 x $68,035,515.62). Similarly, therefined product portion of the ARCO monies is $46,387,975.26 (0.68182 x68,035,515.62). In addition to these sums, the pools will also includeproportionate shares of the interest that has accrued on the escrow account.            In the PDandamp;O, we outlined procedures under which purchasers of ARCOrefined covered products could apply for refunds. The procedures involve:(1) Assigning applicants shares of the ARCO settlement, <T3>i.e., </T3>potential refund amounts; and (2) determining the extentto which the claimants were injured by the alleged overcharges. In orderto permit applicants to make refund claims without incurring disproportionatecosts as well as to allow us to equitably and efficiently consider thoseclaims, we set forth a number of presumptions pertaining to both aspectsof the refund procedures.First, we presumed that the alleged product overcharges were spread evenlyin all of ARCO's sales of refined covered products during the consent orderperiod. We therefore proposed that an applicant's maximum potential refundgenerally should be computed by multiplying the per-gallon refund amountby the number of gallons of ARCO refined covered products that the claimantpurchased during the refund period.\7\<NOTE/> The resulting figure is referred to as the claimant's ``fullvolumetric share'' of the ARCO consent order funds. We further proposed,however, that an applicant could rebut the volumetric refund presumptionby showing that it sustained a disproportionate share of the alleged overcharges.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Based on the revised calculation of the product portion($46,387,975.26) of the money that the DOE ultimately received from ARCO(<T3>see supra </T3>note 6), we are raising the per-gallon refund amountfrom $0.000710 to $0.000735 per gallon ($46,387,975.26/63,109,256,000 gallonsof refined covered products estimated to have been sold by ARCO duringthe refund period).Because demonstrating that one was forced to absorb ARCO's alleged overchargesis potentially difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, we proposed toadopt a number of presumptions concerning injury. For example, we proposedto presume that resellers and retailers claiming refunds of $5,000 or less,end users, agricultural cooperatives, and certain types of regulated firmswere injured by ARCO's alleged overcharges. We also proposed to presumethat resellers and retailers that made only spot purchasers from ARCO aswell as consignee agents were not injured and are therefore ineligiblefor refunds. We stated that applicants not covered by one of these injurypresumptions would be required to demonstrate that they were forced toabsorb ARCO's alleged overcharges in order to receive their full volumetricshares of the ARCO consent order funds.\8\<NOTE/> We further proposed, however, that with respect to theirpurchases of ARCO motor gasoline resellers and retailers should be allowedto receive 41 percent of their full volumetric shares up to $50,000, withoutmaking detailed demonstrations of injury. This ``mid-level'' presumptionthat ARCO resellers and retailers absorbed 41 percent of the alleged overchargesassociated with ARCO's sales of motor gasoline was based on national averageprofit margin data for resellers and retailers of motor gasoline.\9\<NOTE/> Because suitable profit margin data for other products wereunavailable, we proposed to restrict the use of the mid-level presumptionto claimants' purchases of ARCO motor gasoline.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ As stated in the PDandamp;O, an applicant attempting todemonstrate injury must: (1) show that it maintained banks of unrecoupedincreased product costs of sufficient size to justify the amount of therefund claimed; and (2) demonstrate that market conditions forced it toabsorb the alleged overcharges.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ We computed the 41-percent fraction from information concerningthe percentage of months of our data set in which the profit margins ofresellers and retailers declined.III. Comments on the Proposed ProceduresThe PDandamp;O was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 2, 1986, and comments on the proposedrefund procedures were requested by August 1, 1986. <T3>See </T3>51 FR 24206. In addition, copies of the PDandamp;O were mailedto a variety of organizations representing a broad spectrum of potentialARCO refund applicants. Ten parties filed comments on the proposed refundprocedures. Those comments, which concern an array of issues, are discussedbelow.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Crude Oil Comments</ITAG>In the PDandamp;O, we proposed to distribute the crude oil portion of theARCO consent order funds in accordance with the DOE's Statement of RestitutionaryPolicy in Crude Oil Cases (SRP). 50 FR 27400 (July 2, 1985). The Commonwealthof Pennsylvania, however, urged us not to follow this policy and, instead,to distribute the ARCO crude oil funds to state governments as a way ofeffecting indirect restitution. On July 28, 1986, after we had issued theARCO PDandamp;O and after the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had filed itscomments, the DOE amended the SRP. <T3>See </T3>51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1987). Under the Modified Statementof Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases (MSRP), up to 20 percent ofcrude oil overcharge funds will be reserved for the payment of refundsto eligible applicants, and the balance will be divided between the statesand the U.S. Treasury, as indirect restitution to unidentified injuredparties. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has presented no convincing argumentswhy we should not follow standard departmental policy, and we will distributethe ARCO crude oil monies in accordance with the MRSP.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Refined Product Comments</ITAG>Most of the comments which we received concern the proposed proceduresfor distributing the refined product portion of the ARCO consent orderfunds. One of the commenters, Mr. Richard Gindhart, was a small retailerof ARCO motor gasoline whose firm was located in Bellingham, Washington.Mr. Gindhart states that, in 1973, ARCO opened a large self-service stationnear him that charged prices equal to the prices charged to him by hisARCO distributor. Mr. Gindhart states that as a result of ARCO's ``predatorypricing practices'', he suffered a significant sales volume decline andeventually sold his business in January 1978 at a price that he stateswas substantially less than the firm's market value. He therefore contendsthat he should be able to apply for a refund based not only on his fullvolumetric share of the ARCO consent order funds but also on the ``injury''associated with ARCO's alleged ``predatory pricing practices.''Mr. Gindhart's claims, if true, could conceivably have formed the basisfor a private action against ARCO. Claims in the ARCO refund proceeding,however, must be based on matters resolved in the Consent Order pertainingto ARCO's compliance with the Mandatory Petroleum Price and AllocationRegulations. The arguments raised by Mr. Gindhart, though compelling, arenot covered by the Consent Order. Therefore, unless Mr. Gindhart, or anyother applicant, demonstrates that he either suffered a disproportionateshare of the alleged overcharges or lost profits because of an ARCO allocationviolation, he may only apply for his volumetric share of the ARCO consentorder funds.Several parties filed comments regarding the proposed injury presumptions.\1\\0\<NOTE/> For example, the Controller of California (Controller) disagreeswith the presumption that resellers and retailers claiming refunds of $5,000or less were injured by the alleged overcharges. He suggests a hypotheticalsituation in which a wholesaler and its retailer customer, if they aresmall claimants, would both be presumed to have absorbed 100 percent ofthe alleged overcharges associated with a given volume of ARCO products.In the past, the Controller has objected to our use of any injury presumptionsfor resellers and retailers. In this case, he insists that if we adoptsuch measures we should apply an absorption fraction similar to the oneenvisioned for use with mid-level motor gasoline claims. In the Controller'sopinion, all resellers and retailers that wish to receive full volumetricrefunds should be required to submit detailed proof of injury.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Most of the commenters requested that we make changesin our proposed injury presumptions. The Northern Illinois Gas Company,however, expressed support for our proposal to presume that regulated utilitieswere injured by ARCO's alleged overcharges.We do not agree with the Controller's position. Because demonstrating injurycan be an expensive, time-consuming undertaking, failure to allow simplifiedapplication procedures for small claimants could effecively preclude suchapplicants from seeking refunds.\1\\1\<NOTE/> As we have stated in many previous cases, the small claimspresumption provides adequate incentive for firms to apply for relativelysmall refunds, minimizes data retrieval burdens for small firms, and promotesefficient consideration of these types of applications by OHA. <T3>See, e.g., Texas Oil andamp; Gas Corporation, et al., </T3>12 DOE andpara;85,069 at 88,210 (1984) (<T3>Texas Oil andamp; Gas</T3>). However, when we grant a small claimanta full volumetric refund, we are not making a specific finding regardingthe portion of the alleged overcharges that the applicant absorbed. <T3>See Little America Refining Company/University Gas, </T3>14 DOE andpara;85,216 at 88,401 (1986). Therefore, direct and indirect purchasers canboth properly receive small claims refunds for a given volume of ARCO products.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ If we followed the Controller's alternative suggestionand substituted the small claims presumption with an absorption presumption,we would still be effectively preventing small firms from seeking fullvolumetric refunds.Two commenters, the ARCO Distributors Group (Distributors) and the ARCOJobbers Group (Jobbers), suggest that we increase the $5,000 small claimsamount with respect to applications filed by ARCO resellers. The Distributorsand Jobbers believe that for the sake of administrative efficiency andin light of the passage of time, an average-sized reseller \1\\2\<NOTE/> should be able to receive a full volumetric refund withoutmaking a detailed showing of injury. The Distributors and Jobbers statethat applying the $5,000 small claims amount to both resellers and retailersunfairly discriminates against resellers since the full volumetric refundof an average-sized retailer \1\\3\<NOTE/> would fall within the $5,000 limit while that of the average-sizedreseller would not.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ Both the Distributors and Jobbers wish to base theirdefinition of ``avarage-sized reseller'' on the results of a 1986 surveyconducted by the Petroleum Marketers Association of America (PMAA) in whichthe organization requested information concerning its members' annual salesvolumes of finished petroleum products. According to that survey, the meanannual sales volume figure was 8.4 million gallons; the median annual salesvolume figure was 4.4 million gallons.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ Citing the 1986 NPN Factbook, the Jobbers state thatthe average service station in the United States sold approximately 61,000gallons of petroleum products per month.Adopting the suggestion of the Distributors and Jobbers would require usto depart from the considerations that led to the small claims presumption.The focus of the presumption is the size of the refund to be granted andwhether the benefits to be obtained by the increased accuracy that is possiblethrough analyzing injury data outweigh the burdens of supplying and reviewingthe data. The presumption was adopted to assist applicants seeking smallrefunds regardless of whether the applicants are ``average-sized'' resellersor retailers. Under the approach suggested by the Distributors and Jobbers,even if we used the PMAA survey's lower median volume figure to define``average-sized reseller'', the small claims amount would be set at over$25,000 (4.4 million gal./yr. andmultiply; 7.8 andmultiply; $0.000735/gal.= $25,225.20). We believe that if a reseller requests a full volumetricrefund of this magnitude, the additional effort necessary for a detailedinjury analysis is warranted. <T3>See Gulf Oil Corporation, </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,381 at 88,738 (1987)(<T3>Gulf II</T3>); <T3>Marathon Petroleum Company, </T3>14 DOE andpara; 85,269 at 88,510 (1986)(<T3>Marathon</T3>). We also received comments on our proposal to allow resellers and retailersof ARCO motor gasoline to receive 41 percent of their volumetric sharesup to $50,000, without making detailed showings of injury. The Controllerof California (Controller) claims that ``administrative convenience'' doesnot justify adoption of the 41-percent absorption presumption. He alsocontends that the 41-percent figure was inappropriately derived and that,instead of using national average profit margin data for resellers andretailers of motor gasoline to compute this fraction, we should have reliedon the information outlined in the<T3> Report of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, In Re: The Departmentof Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3> MDL No. 378 (D. Kan.filed June 21, 1985), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 90,507 (1985) (StripperWell Report).The Stripper Well Report addressed the absorption by refiners of crudeoil overcharges. It did not consider overcharges on refined products orthe absorption of such overcharges. As a result, the Stripper Well Reporthas no bearing on the alleged refined product overcharges in this proceeding.<T3> See Marathon,</T3> at 88,510-11. Nor was the proposal to adopt themid-level injury presumption made solely for ``administrative convenience.''The 41-percent presumption was based on the best data at hand, and it promotesefficient, effective and equitable distribution of refunds to injured parties.<T3> See</T3> 10 CFR 205.282(e). Consequently, we reject the Controller'scomments.Four commenters, the ARCO Distributors Group (Distributors), the ARCO JobbersGroup (Jobbers), the National Association of Truck Stop Operators (NATSO),and the class of wholesale purchaser-resellers in<T3> Van Vranken, et al. v. Atlantic Richfield Company,</T3> Civil No.C-79-0627-SW (N.D. Cal.) (<T3>Van Vranken class</T3>) \14\<NOTE/> request that purchasers of ARCO middle distillates also beallowed to use the 41-percent mid-level injury presumption.\15\<NOTE/> The<T3> Van Vranken</T3> class states that restricting the use of this presumptionto purchases of ARCO motor gasoline discriminates against truck stop operatorsand certain jobbers for whom diesel fuel represents a significant portionof their purchases. The Jobbers and NATSO believe that the extension ofthe mid-level presumption to middle distillate purchases would: (1) FurtherOHA's restitutionary duty in Subpart V proceedings; (2) ease the administrativeburden on OHA in conducting the ARCO refund proceeding; and (3) be consistentwith procedures used in other large refund proceedings.<T3> See Gulf II,</T3> at 88,740;<T3> Getty,</T3> at 88,123;<T3> Marathon,</T3> at 88,515. Moreover, the Jobbers and NATSO state thatextending the mid-level injury presumption to purchases of ARCO middledistillates would not be counter-intuitive.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>Van Vranken, et al. v. The Atlantic Richfield Company,</T3> Civil No.C-79-0627-SW (N.D. Cal.) is a private damage action filed pursuant to Section210 of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 alleging the same overchargesthat were resolved by the Consent Order underlying the ARCO special refundproceeding. On March 25, 1986, the United States District Court for theNorthern District of California certified a class of wholesale purchaser-resellersin that litigation pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ In the PDandamp;O, we stated that resellers of motor gasolinein two-tiered distribution systems experienced reduced profit margins in45 percent of the studied months while those in three-tiered distributionsystems suffered profit margin reductions in 40 percent of the studiedmonths. We also indicated that retailers of motor gasoline in two-tiereddistribution systems experienced reduced profit margins in 42 percent ofthe studied months while those in three-tiered systems suffered profitmargin reductions in 37 percent of the studied months. Citing this information,the Distributors want us to raise the mid-level absorption fraction to43 percent for claims filed by resellers. We will not adopt this suggestionsince, as we stated in the PDandamp;O, the use of a single, average absorptionfraction simplifies the refund procedures for the benefit of both the claimantsand the DOE.We find considerable merit in these comments. Although we stated in thePDandamp;O that the lack of adequate profit margin data for other productscaused us to restrict the use of the mid-level presumption to purchasesof ARCO motor gasoline, the additional experience that we have gained inconducting large refund proceedings since the issuance of the PDandamp;Oconfirms that a broader use of this presumption is warranted. Accordingly,we will allow resellers and retailers of<T3> all</T3> ARCO refined covered products to use the mid-level injurypresumption.\16\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ Zephyr, Inc. of Muskegon, Michigan suggests that applicantsbe permitted to employ both the 41-percent presumption for their motorgasoline purchases and the small claims presumption for their purchasesof other refined covered products. The firm claims it would be inequitableto require an applicant to waive its right to receive a small claims refundfor purchases of products such as middle distillates merely because ithas used the 41-percent presumption with respect to its purchases of motorgasoline. Our extension of the 41-percent injury presumption to purchasesof all ARCO refined covered products should eliminate Zephyr's concerns.There is, however, no basis for establishing separate small claims thresholdsfor separate products.The <T3>Van Vranken</T3> class also suggests that we combine the small claimspresumption with the 41-percent mid-level presumption so that a reselleror retailer of ARCO products that chose not to demonstrate injury wouldbe able to receive a full volumetric refund up to $5,000 and 41 percentof the volumetric amount for all purchases in excess of those necessaryto reach the $5,000 small claims limitation. The <T3>Van Vranken</T3> class maintains that this approach would provide amore equitable distribution of refunds and points out that if we do notadopt its proposal, resellers and retailers that are potentially eligiblefor full volumetric refunds between $5,000 and $12,196 would have to demonstrateinjury or elect to limit their claims to $5,000.As we have stated, the small claims presumption was adopted in order toavoid a situation in which the cost of preparing a refund claim exceedsthe value of the potential refund. We have previously concluded that theseconsiderations apply to claims for $5,000 or less. Plainly, the fact thatan applicant seeking a refund of more than $5,000 may have to demonstrateinjury certainly does not alter our conclusion. Moreover, there is nothingin the <T3>Van Vranken</T3> class submission that would lead us to alter thisconclusion. Consequently, we will not adopt the <T3>Van Vranken</T3> class proposal.We also received comments concerning the type of material that must besubmitted to demonstrate injury. E-Z Serve Petroleum Refining and Marketing(E-Z), a firm located in Abilene, Texas, believes that resellers and retailersattempting to demonstrate injury should only be required to submit informationregarding their banks of unrecouped increased product costs. The firm allegesthat it is unreasonably burdensome to require these claimants to show thatmarket conditions forced them to absorb the alleged overcharges.There are two reasons why the existence of cost banks, by themselves donot show injury. First, cost banks were not supplier specific. In otherwords, an applicant's cost banks could have resulted from increased productcosts associated with products purchased from other suppliers, not fromany alleged ARCO overcharges. In addition, an applicant could have accumulatedcost banks as part of a marketing strategy emphasizing high sales volumesrather than profit margins. In the latter case, the claimant would nothave been forced by market conditions to absorb its supplier's price increases,and thus would not have been injured by the alleged overcharges. In lightof the foregoing considerations, we believe that the second aspect of ourinjury requirement is essential. We must therefore reject E-Z's comments.The ARCO Distributors Group (Distributors) asks that we modify the proposedrefund procedures to allow claimants attempting to demonstrate injury tosubmit only annual profit and loss statements. We cannot adopt this suggestion,because annual profit and loss statements are not probative of the relevantquestion. Data from such statements do not allow us to determine whetheran applicant was forced to absorb any of ARCO's alleged overcharges. Thereare any number of factors other than increased cost of goods from one supplierthat may produce lowered profitability for example, higher prices fromother suppliers, higher salaries, additional financing requirements, etc.Because the information contained in annual profit and loss instatementsdoes not allow us to determine whether any deteriorating operating conditionsresult from a combination of market conditions and a single supplier'sprices, such statements are insufficient to show injury and cannot aloneform the basis for a refund.Zephyr, Inc. (Zephyr) pointed out that although the consent order periodbegins on January 1, 1973, the refund period specified in the PDandamp;Obegins on March 6, 1973. Zephyr states that ARCO was subject to mandatoryCost of Living Council (CLC) price regulations during the period, January1, 1973, through March 5, 1973, and that resellers and retailers were notsimilarly regulated until June 14, 1973. Therefore, Zephyr requests thatclaimants be allowed to seek refunds for ARCO purchases made during theperiod, January 1, 1973, through March 5, 1973, and that reseller and retailerclaimants not be required to demonstrate injury or be subject to the 41-percentmid-level presumption with respect to purchases made prior to June 14,1973.ARCO was <T3>not</T3> subject to mandatory controls prior to March 6, 1973. As aresult, we concluded that the refund period should begin on that date,rather than at the onset of the consent order period.However, we generally agree with the second part of Zephyr's comments.Because resellers and retailers were not subject to mandatory price controlsprior to June 14, 1973, they were not required to maintain records documentingtheir purchase costs. Therefore, it would difficult for them to providethe information necessary to demonstrate injury. <T3>See Office of Special Counsel, </T3>11 DOE andpara; 85,226 at 88, 389-90(1984). Accordingly, resellers and retailers will not be required to demonstrateinjury or be subject to the 41-percent mid-level presumption with respectto their purchases of ARCO refined covered products prior to June 14, 1973.However, in order to receive full volumetric refunds for the gallons boughtduring that period, they will be required to submit accurate monthly purchasevolume data. In the ARCO PDandamp;O, we did not propose procedures for disbursing residualpetroleum product monies in the ARCO escrow account. In two sets of comments,the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Attorneys General of the statesof Arkansas, Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah,and West Virginia requested that these funds be distributed to state governmentsas a way of effecting indirect restitution to their citizens. On October21, 1986, after the PDandamp;O had been issued and after these comments hadbeen filed, Congress enacted the Petroleum Overchange Distribution andRestitution Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-509, Title III (PODRA). <T3>See </T3>Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 11,702 <T3>et seq. </T3>PODRA requires the Secretary of Energy to determine annuallythe amount of petroleum product overcharge funds that will not be requiredto refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings, and to makethose funds available to state governments for use in four energy conservationprograms. PODRA, andSection;andSection; 3003 (c) and (d). The Secretary hasdelegated these responsibilities to OHA, and any funds in the product portionof the ARCO escrow account that OHA determines will not be needed to effectdirect restitution to injured parties will be distributed in accordancewith the provisions of PODRA. \1\\7\<NOTE/> Because the PODRA monies will ultimately be distributed tothe states, we are essentially adopting the commenters' suggestion. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ Pursuant to PODRA, $11,596,993.83, plus interest, wasdisbursed from the ARCO refined product pool in 1986. 51 Fed. Reg. 43964.(December 5, 1986). After the PDandamp;O had been issued, and after the comment period had expired,the DOE was approached by ARCO and counsel for Mr. Don Van Vranken, theclass representative in <T3>Van Vranken, et al. v. Atlantic Richfield Company, </T3>Civil No. C-79-0627-SW(N.D. Cal.) (<T3>Van Vranken</T3>), a private action pending against ARCO in the UnitedStates District Court for the Northern District of California. ARCO and counsel for the class in <T3>Van Vranken </T3>\1\\8\<NOTE/> informally sought to have the DOE select class counsel assole representative for the ``class'' of persons involved in the lawsuitagainst ARCO, <T3>i.e. </T3>all resellers and retailers that purchased motor gasoline,middle distillates, propane, butane, and aviation fuels from ARCO duringthe period August 1, 1973, through January 28, 1981.\1\\9\<NOTE/> The DOE rejected the proposal, and stated that it was unacceptablebecause the Department could not relinquish a governmental decision-makingfunction specifically delegated to DOE and OHA by statute, and becauseit would also divert Consent Order funds intended for restitution to injuredparties to defer legal fees and administrative costs of counsel for theclass. January 20, 1987 letter from Richard T. Tedrow, OHA Deputy Director,to Richard C. Morse, counsel for ARCO. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ Counsel for the Van Vranken class are: <ITAG tagnum="28">Josef D. Cooper, Esq., Law Offices of Josef D. Cooper, 100 The Embarcadero,Penthouse, San Francisco, CA 94105,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">   and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Tracy R. Kirkham, Esq., Hennigan andamp; Mercer, 611 W. Sixth Street,28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90017.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ Under this scenario, class counsel would file a claimthat would set forth on an aggregatge basis the total volume of purchasesof refined covered products during the refund period by all members ofthe class based on records to be provided by ARCO. In the event OHA acceptedthe class claim, the total refund for the class would be transferred toa Court-approved escrow agent. After compensating the class counsel witha portion of the refund monies, the Court would distribute the remainingfunds to the individual class members that responded to the solicitationof class counsel. Monies to which non-responding members of the class wouldotherwise be entitled would be included in this distribution. This latteraspect of the proposal is inconsistent with DOE practice and Congressionalintent, since it would provide inappropriate windfalls to responding membersof the class at the expense of non-responding injured parties and of thoseentitled to indirect restitution. <T3>See </T3>Denny Klepper Oil Co. v. DOE, 598 F. Supp. 522, 527 (D.D.C.1984). Notwithstanding the outright rejection of the ARCO/class counsel proposal,during July 1987, OHA became aware that the same scenario had been embodiedin a Proposed Settlement of the <T3>Van Vranken </T3>litigation that had been formulated between ARCO andcounsel for the class and tentatively approved by the Court. In additionto its other aspects that would preclude its adoption by DOE, the ProposedSettlement would appoint class counsel to be the <T3>exclusive </T3>representative of the entire class of first-purchaserresellers and retailers in the ARCO Subpart V proceeding. In other words,if the Proposed Settlement were finalized, any class member that did notfile an ``Election to Be Excluded'' with the Court by August 21, 1987,would be barred from filing an individual refund claim with the DOE inthe ARCO Subpart V proceeding. In view of the seriousness of this matter,the DOE filed an <T3>amicus curiae </T3>brief to inform the Court that because all similarrefund applications submitted on behalf of ``classes'', such as that contemplatedby the Proposed Settlement, had been rejected by the DOE, there was everyreason to believe that the class application contemplated by the ProposedSettlement would also be rejected, thereby rendering the Proposed Settlementvalueless to the class members. The DOE also pointed out that each memberof the <T3>Van Vranken </T3>class would, in any event, be entitled to file a refundclaim in the DOE's Subpart V proceeding without incurring any of the legalor other costs to be paid to class counsel under the Proposed Settlement.Thus, it is difficult to see how the Proposed Settlement could reasonablybe expected to benefit the <T3>Van Vranken </T3>class. The Court has taken these matters under consultation.Because they remain unresolved, we are taking this opportunity to reiterateour opposition to the Proposed Settlement and to emphasize that any classrefund application such as that contemplated by the Proposed Settlementwould in all likelihood be rejected. IV. Distribution of the ARCO Crude Oil Funds The ARCO crude oil monies, $21,647,540.36, plus interest, will be disbursedin accordance with the MSRP, using the procedures described in <T3>A. Tarricone, Inc., et al., </T3>15 DOE andpara; 85,495 (1987) (<T3>Tarricone</T3>). Up to 20 percent of those funds, $4,329,508.06, plusinterest, will be distributed to injured parties in the DOE's Subpart Vcrude oil refund proceeding. Refunds to eligible purchasers in that proceedingwill be based on a per-gallon refund amount derived by dividing the sumof all crude oil overcharge monies in escrow by the total U.S. consumptionof petroleum products during the period of federal petroleum price controls.\2\\0\<NOTE/> The principal volumetric refund amount associated with theARCO crude oil funds is $0.0000107 per gallon. For further informationconcerning application procedures in the Subpart V crude oil proceeding,<T3>see Berry Holding Company, et al., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,405 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ It is estimated that 2,020,997,335,000 gallons of petroleumproducts were consumed in the United States during the period August 1973through January 1981. Mountain Fuel Supply Company, 14, DOE andpara; 85,475at 88,868 n. 4. (1986)The remaining 80 percent of the ARCO crude oil funds, $17,318,032.30, plusinterest, as well as any portion of the above-mentioned 20-percent reservethat is not distributed, will be divided equally between the states andthe federal government for indirect restitution. We will therefore directthe DOE's Office of the Controller to disburse immediately $8,659,016.15,plus interest, to the federal government and to transfer $8,659,016.15,plus interest, into a special interest-bearing subaccount from which weshortly will make disbursements to the individual states.\2\\1\<NOTE/> Each state's share of the funds is set forth in the StripperWell Exemption Litigation Settlement Agreement, <T3>see </T3>6 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 90,509 at 90,687 (1986), andis based on each state's consumption of petroleum products during the periodof federal price controls. These funds are subject to the same limitationsand reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by thestates under the Settlement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ As of December 31, 1987, the amount of accrued interestthat the states and the federal government will each receive is $1,541,119.84.V. Final Refund Procedures for the ARCO Refined Product Funds We will use the monies in the ARCO refined product pool to provide refundsto claimants that demonstrate that they were injured by the regulatoryviolations allegedly committed by ARCO in its sales of refined coveredproducts during the March 6, 1973, through January 27, 1981 refund period.\2\\2\<NOTE/> From our experience with Subpart V proceedings, we expectthat most applicants will fall into the following categories of ARCO refinedproduct purchasers: (1) Resellers and retailers; (2) end users, <T3>i.e., </T3>ultimate consumers; and (3) regulated entities, such aspublic utilities, and cooperatives. Residual refined product funds in theARCO escrow account will be distributed in accordance with PODRA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ Because the Consent Order covers ARCO's compliancewith all aspects of the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations,the refined product escrow funds will be used to provide restitution tofirms that show that they were injured by ARCO's allocation of its refinedcovered products. For these claimants, we will use the procedures outlinedin Power Pak Co., Inc., 14 DOE andpara; 85,001 (1986). The remainder of thissection concerns the filing of refund claims involving ARCO's alleged refinedproduct pricing violations.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Calculation of Refund Amounts</ITAG>In order to determine the potential refund amounts for applicants in thisproceeding, we are presuming that the alleged product overcharges werespread evenly over all of the gallons of refined covered products thatARCO sold during the refund period. Under this volumetric presumption,a claimant's maximum potential refund will generally be computed by multiplying$0.000735 per gallon, the per-gallon refund amount, by the number of gallonsof ARCO refined covered products \23\<NOTE/> that the applicant purchased during the refund period. Theresulting figure is referred to as the claimant's ``full volumetric share''of the ARCO consent order funds.\24\<NOTE/> Successful applicants will also receive proportionate sharesof the interest that has accrued on the ARCO escrow account.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ Purchases of deregulated products, <T3>i.e., </T3>products that were no longer ``covered'' by the MandatoryPetroleum Price and Allocation Regulations, 6cannot be used in the calculationof an applicant's potential refund amount. Below is a list of productssold by ARCO and the dates on which they were deregulated:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xl45</C> <H1>Product</H1><H1>Date decontrolled</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Motor Gasoline, Propane <D>Jan. 28, 1981.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Butane, Natural Gasoline <D>Jan. 1, 1980.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aviation Gas, Jet Fuel <D>Feb. 26, 1979.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphtha-Based Jet Fuel <D>Oct. 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naphthas, Lubricants, Lube Oil <D>Sept. 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Middle Distillates <D>July 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Residual Fuel <D>June 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethane, Asphalt <D>April 1, 1974.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ As in previous refund proceedings, claims for less than$15 in principal will not be processed because the cost of consideringthose claims outweighs the benefits of restitution in those situations.<T3>See e.g., </T3>Uban Oil Company et al., 9 DOE andpara; 82,541 at 85,225(1982). In this proceeding, this consideration precludes claims based uponpurchases of less than 19,728 gallons of ARCO refined covered products.The volumetric refund presumption is rebuttable. If an applicant believesthat it incurred a disproportionate share of the alleged overcharges, itmay submit evidence proving this claim in order to be potentially eligiblefor a larger refund. <T3>See, e.g., Standard Oil Company (Indiana)/Army and Air Force ExchangeService, </T3>12 DOE andpara; 85,015 (1984).<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Determination of Injury</ITAG>The assignment of potential refund amounts to claimants is only the firststep in the distribution process. We must also determine whether theseclaimants were forced to absorb the alleged overcharges. As in many otherrefund proceedings, we are adopting several presumptions concerning injury.Applicants that are not covered by one of these presumptions must demonstrateinjury in accordance with the non-presumption procedures outlined belowin Section 2.1. <T3>Injury Presumptions. </T3>These injury presumptions are designed toallow claimants to participate in the refund process, without incurringinordinate expenses and to enable OHA to consider the refund applicationsin the most efficient way possible. Each of these presumptions is listedbelow along with the rationale underlying its use.a. <T3>End Users. </T3>End users, <T3>i.e., </T3>ultimate consumers, of ARCO covered products will be presumedto have been injured by the alleged overcharges. Unlike regulated firmsin the petroleum industry, members of this group generally were not subjectto price controls during the consent order period. Therefore, they weretherefore not required to base their pricing decisions on cost increasesor to keep records that would show whether they passed through cost increases.An analysis of the impact of the alleged overcharges on the final pricesof goods and services that were not covered by the petroleum price regulationswould therefore be beyond the scope of a special refund proceeding. <T3>See Texas Oil andamp; Gas, </T3>at 88,209, and cases cited therein. Consequently,end users must only document the volume of ARCO refined covered productsthat they purchased during the refund period in order to receive a refund.b. <T3>Regulated Firms and Cooperatives. </T3>Public utilities, agriculturalcooperatives, and other firms whose prices are regulated by governmententities or governed by cooperative agreements do not have to submit detailedproof of injury. These firms routinely would have passed through priceincreases to their customers, and will now pass on to their customers thebenefits associated with refunds. <T3>See, e.g., Office of Special Counsel, </T3>9 DOE andpara; 82,538 at 85,203(1982) (<T3>Tenneco</T3>); <T3>Office of Special Counsel, </T3>9 DOE andpara; 82,545 at 85,244 (1982).In order to ensure this result, in addition to documenting the volume ofits ARCO purchases, a public utility or cooperative must submit a planexplaining both how its customers will benefit from a refund, and how itwill alert the appropriate regulatory body or membership group to the moneysreceived. Purchases by a cooperative that were subsequently resold to nonmemberswill not be covered by this presumption.c. <T3>Resellers and Retailers Filing Small Claims. </T3>Resellers and retailersof ARCO refined covered products claiming refunds of $5,000 or less, excludingaccrued interest, will be presumed to have been injured by ARCO's allegedovercharges. Without this presumption, such an applicant would have tosort through records dating as far back as 1973 to gather proof that itabsorbed the alleged overcharges. The cost to the claimant of gatheringthis information, and to OHA of analyzing it, could exceed the actual refundamount. Under this injury presumption, a small claimant must only documentthe volume of ARCO refined covered products that it purchased during therefund period. <T3>See Texas Oil andamp; Gas, </T3>at 88,210; <T3>Office of Special Counsel, </T3>11 DOE andpara; 85,226 (1984); and casescited therein. Resellers and retailers that are seeking full volumetricrefunds in excess of $5,000 must follow the non-presumption proceduresoutlined below in Section 2.d. <T3>Resellers and Retailers Filing Mid-Level Claims. </T3>Resellers andretailers whose full volumetric shares of the ARCO consent order fundsexceed $12,193, may elect to receive 41 percent of their full volumetricshares up to $50,000 without providing detailed demonstrations of injury.\25\<NOTE/> As we stated above, this option is based on the presumptionthat mid-level resellers and retailers absorbed 41 percent of ARCO's allegedovercharges.\26\<NOTE/> Resellers and retailers that wish to receive refunds in excessof $50,000 must follow the non-presumption procedures described in Section2.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ A reseller or retailer whose full volumetric share is$12,193 or less could receive a larger percentage refund under the smallclaims presumption than under the 41-percent mid-level injury presumption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Large resellers and retailers, <T3>i.e., </T3>those whose full volumetric shares exceed $121,952 may electto limit their claims to $50,000 and thereby qualify for a refund underthe mid-level injury presumption.e. <T3>Spot Purchasers. </T3>Resellers and retailers that were spot purchasersof ARCO refined covered products, <T3>i.e., </T3>firms that made only sporadic, discretionary purchases,are presumed to have been injured by ARCO's pricing practices and thereforegenerally will be ineligible for refunds. The basis for this presumptionis that spot purchasers tend to have considerable discretion as to whereand when to make purchases and would therefore not have made spot marketpurchases at increased prices unless they considered those purchases tobe beneficial. <T3>See Tenneco, </T3>at 85,201; <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>8 DOE andpara; 82,597 at 85,396-97 (1981)(<T3>Vickers</T3>).The spot purchaser presumption, however, is rebuttable; we will considerevidence that spot purchasers ``were unable to recover the product pricesthey paid * * *'' <T3>Office of Special Counsel, 10 DOE andpara; 85,042 at 88,200 (1982). </T3><T3>See also Marion Corp., </T3>12 DOE andpara; 85,014 (1985); <T3>Tenneco Oil Co./Imperial Oil Co., </T3>10 DOE andpara; 85,002 (1982).In other proceedings, we have waived the presumption against injury forspot purchasers that demonstrate that: (1) they did not have discretionin making the spot purchases; and (2) they were forced by market conditionsto resell the product at a loss that was not subsequently recouped. <T3>See, e.g., Saber Energy, Inc./Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>14 DOE andpara; 85,170(1986). If a spot purchaser rebuts this presumption, its application willbe evaluated according to the standards applicable to the refund claimsof all other resellers and retailers.f. <T3>Consignees. </T3>Finally, as in previous cases, we will presume thatconsignees of ARCO refined covered products were not injured by the allegedovercharges. <T3>See e.g., Jay Oil Company,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,147 at 88,286 (1987).A consignee agent is an entity that distributed products pursuant to anagreement whereby its supplier established the prices to be paid and chargedby the consignee and compensated the consignee with a fixed commissionbased upon the volume of products distributed. This presumption may berebutted by showing that the consignee's sales volumes and correspondingcommission revenues declined due to the alleged uncompetitiveness of ARCO'spricing practices. <T3>See Gulf Oil Corporation/C.F. Canter Oil Company, </T3>13 DOE andpara;85,388 at 88,962 (1986).2. <T3>Non-Presumption Demonstrations of Injury. </T3>A reseller or retailerwith a full volumetric share in excess of $5,000 that does not elect toreceive a refund under either the small claims presumption or the 41-percentmid-level presumption, will be required to document its injury. There aretwo aspects to such a demonstration. First, a firm is generally requiredto provide a monthly schedule of its banks of unrecouped increased productcosts for each ARCO refined covered product that it purchased during therefund period. Cost banks for a product generally should cover the periodbetween November 1, 1973,\27\<NOTE/> and the date on which the product was decontrolled.\28\<NOTE/> If a firm no longer has records of contemporaneously calculatedcost banks for a particular product, it may approximate those banks bysubmitting the following information:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ The regulations allowing resellers and retailers to bankunrecouped increased product costs did not take effect until November 1,1973. <T3>See </T3>10 CFR 212.93(e)(1)(i).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ Retailers and resellers of motor gasoline were only requiredto maintain cost bank data up through July 15, 1979, and April 30, 1980,respectively. Therefore, in showing injury with respect to their purchasesof motor gasoline, such claimants will not be required to submit cost bankmaterial up to the January 28, 1981 decontrol date of motor gasoline.(1) The weighted average gross profit margin that the firm received forthe product on May 15, 1973;(2) A monthly schedule of the weighted average gross profit margins thatit received for the product between November 1, 1973, and the date on whichthe product was decontrolled. Because cost banks were not supplier specific,the calculation of these monthly weighted average gross profit marginsshould be based on the claimant's purchases of the product from all ofits suppliers; and(3) A monthly schedule of the firm's sales of the product between November1, 1973, and the date on which the product was decontrolled.\29\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ For motor gasoline, retailers and resellers only haveto submit the information detailed in Parts (2) and (3) through July 15,1979, and April 30, 1980, respectively. <T3>See supra </T3>note 28.In addition to showing that it maintained cost banks equal to our greaterthan the value of the refund claimed, a reseller or retailer attemptingto prove injury must also show that market conditions forced it to absorbthe alleged overcharges. Generally, we will infer this to be true if theprices the applicant paid ARCO were higher than average market prices forthe same level of distribution. Accordingly, a reseller or retailer attemptingto demonstrate injury should submit a monthly schedule of the weightedaverage prices that it paid ARCO for each refined covered product thatit purchased during the June 14, 1973, through January 27, 1981 portionof the refund period.\30\<NOTE/> As previously stated, resellers and retailers need only submitmonthly purchase volume data for the period March 6, 1973, through June13, 1973.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Because applicants are only eligible for refunds basedon refined products that were ``covered'' by the federal price and allocationregulations, purchase price data for a particular product should only besubmitted for the period between June 14, 1973, and the date on which theproduct was decontrolled. <T3>See supra </T3>note 23.<ITAG tagnum="28">We generally obtain average market price information from Platt'sOil Price Handbook and Oilmanac (Platt's). If price data for a particularproduct is not available in Platt's, the burden of supplying alternativeinformation will be on the claimant.</ITAG>A reseller or retailer that makes a detailed demonstration of injury willreceive its full volumetric share of the ARCO consent order funds. On theother hand, an applicant that attempts to demonstrate injury, but insteadconclusively shows that it passed through all of the alleged overchargeswill receive no refund. If we conclude that a claimant attempting to demonstrateinjury absorbed some of the alleged overcharges, we will grant a partialrefund based on the extent of the injury shown and not on the small claimspresumption or the 41-percent mid-level presumption. <T3>See Union Texas Petroleum Corporation/Arrow Enterprises, Inc., </T3>15DOE andpara; 85,087 (1986); <T3>Quaker State Oil Refining Corp./Campbell Oil Co., Inc., </T3>15 DOEandpara; 85,089 (1986).VI. Applications for RefundThis determination announces that we will now accept Applications for Refundfrom purchasers of refined covered products sold by ARCO during the period,March 6, 1973, through January 27, 1981. There is no specific applicationform that must be used. We have, however, set forth a suggested formatfor filing an ARCO Application for Refund in the Appendix to this Decisionand Order.\31\<NOTE/> All Applications for Refund must contain the following information:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Note that gasoline retailers must file a separate applicationfor each gasoline station for which a refund is claimed.(1) A conspicuous reference to the ``ARCO Refund Proceeding_Case No. HEF-0591'',the applicant's present name and address, and the name and address of theapplicant during the refund period; (2) The name, title, and telephone number of a person who may be contactedfor additional information concerning the application;(3) An explanation of how the claimant used the ARCO products, <T3>i.e., </T3> whether the applicant was a reseller, retailer, consignee,end user, public utility, cooperative, etc.; (4) For each refined covered product, a monthly schedule of the numberof gallons that the applicant purchased from ARCO during the March 6, 1973,through January 27, 1981 refund period.\3\\2\<NOTE/> If an applicant received a computer printout of its ARCOpurchases from OHA, it may submit that printout in lieu of monthly purchasevolume schedules. If a claimant was an indirect purchaser of ARCO refinedcovered products, it must also submit the name of its immediate supplierand indicate why it believes the products were originally sold by ARCO;<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\2\ Because we will not process claims for less than $15in principal, <T3>see supra</T3> note 24, an applicant must have purchased at least 19,728gallons of ARCO refined covered products during the refund period in orderfor us to consider its application.<ITAG tagnum="28">If an applicant submits estimated purchase volume figures, it mustprovide a detailed explanation of how it derived the estimates. </ITAG>(5) All relevant material necessary to support its claim in accordancewith the injury presumptions and requirements outlined above in SectionV, Part B; (6) If the applicant was or is in any way affiliated with ARCO, an explanationof the nature of that affiliation; (7) A statement as to whether there was a change in ownership of the applicant'sfirm during or since the refund period. If there was such a change in ownership,the applicant must submit a detailed explanation as well as provide thenames and addresses of the previous or subsequent owners; (8) A statement as to whether the claimant is or has been involved in anyDOE enforcement proceedings or private actions filed under andSection;210of the Economic Stabilization Act. If these actions have been concluded,the applicant should furnish a copy of any final order issued in the matter.If the action is still in progress, the applicant should briefly describethe action and its current status. The applicant must inform OHA of anychange in status while its Application for Refund is pending. <T3>See </T3>10 CFR 205.9(d);(9) A statement as to whether the applicant or a related firm has filedany other Application for Refund in the ARCO proceeding; (10) A statement as to whether the claimant or a related firm has authorizedany other individual(s) to file an Application for Refund on the claimant'sbehalf in the ARCO proceeding; and (11) The following statement signed by the applicant or a responsible officialof the business or organization claiming the refund: ``I swear [or affirm]that the information submitted is true and accurate to the best of my knowledgeand belief. I understand that anyone who is convicted of providing falseinformation to the Federal Government may be subject to a fine, a jailsentence, or both, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001.''All Applications for Refund should be sent to: ARCO Refund Proceeding,Case No. HEF-0591, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy,100 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585. All applications <T3>must be filed in duplicate </T3> and postmarked by August 31, 1988.Any claimant that believes that its Application for Refund contains confidentialinformation must submit two additional copies of the application in whichthe confidential information is deleted, together with a statement specifyingwhy the information is confidential. It Is Therefore Ordered That: (1) Applications for Refund from the funds remitted to the Department ofEnergy by the Atlantic Richfield Company pursuant to the Consent Orderfinalized on June 27, 1985, may now be filed. (2) Applications for Refund from the Atlantic Richfield Company refinedproduct pool must be postmarked no later than August 31, 1988. (3) The deadline for filing Applications for Refund from the Atlantic RichfieldCompany crude oil pool will be established by the Office of Hearings andAppeals in the final decision issued in <T3>Ernest A.
