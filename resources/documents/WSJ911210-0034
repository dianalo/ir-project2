Children's advocates hailed the ruling by U.S. DistrictJudge William H. Barbour Jr., of Jackson, Miss., saying thatthis rare involvement of a federal judge in a custody casemight make state judges more careful when handling familymatters.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;What this decision may do is herald a greater right {for}children than has previously been found,&quot; said HeleneBrezinksy, an attorney with the New York firm Rosenman andamp;Colin who specializes in family law matters. She said it wasextremely unusual for a federal judge to reverse andreprimand state judges in this way.   The ruling came in a seven-year-old custody battle betweenthe parents of Crystal Marie Foxworth, who is known asChrissy. Since the battle began, nine-year-old Chrissy hasbeen smuggled to children's rights advocates in San Franciscoby the paralegal of her mother's attorney, undergone severalcourt hearings, and allegedly been subject to sexual abuse byher father. She also has lost her mother, who died of ananeurysm in the midst of the ordeal.   The saga began in 1984, when Chrissy's mother, DorrieSingley, and father, Timothy Foxworth, filed for a divorceafter three years of marriage. The divorce decree grantedcustody to Ms. Singley and gave visitation rights to Mr.Foxworth, but it quickly became apparent that the arrangementwas fraught with conflict.   In 1985, Mr. Foxworth asked the court to hold his formerwife in contempt for denying him access to Chrissy. Despiteallegations by her mother that Mr. Foxworth was sexuallyabusing the child, which Mr. Foxworth denied, MississippiChancery Court Judge Sebe Dale Jr. found the mother incontempt and had her jailed for 10 days.   After two bitter years of conflict over Chrissy'streatment, which roiled the sparsely populated Mississippicounty of Marion, Judge Dale modified the visitation orderand granted substantial custody to Mr. Foxworth. At thispoint, Ms. Singley took her child to New Orleans, whereChrissy was examined by a doctor who concluded that she hadbeen sexually abused. But at a second contempt hearing, JudgeDale refused to consider the doctor's report. He also barredChrissy's mother from reopening the case. Two weeks later, onOct. 14, 1987, Ms. Singley died.   Chrissy disappeared shortly after her mother died andsurfaced in San Francisco on Dec. 5, 1987, accompanied by aparalegal working for Ms. Singley's attorney. A state judgethere returned her to Mississippi, where Judge Dale onceagain gave Chrissy to her father, who lives with his motherin Columbia, Miss.   At that point, the lawyer representing Chrissy's SanFrancisco guardian sought help from the federal court inJackson, claiming that the state court decisions hadn't givenChrissy's representatives a fair chance to show she was indanger.   At first, Judge Barbour balked at getting involved in thecase, finding in August 1988 that legal precedents reservedfamily matters for the state courts. But a federal appealscourt rejected that view and ordered that he hold a hearingto determine whether Chrissy's interests had been adequatelyprotected.   In his ruling, Judge Barbour found that the custodyhearings held by Judge Dale, who sits in Columbia, and byMarion County Youth Court Referee Garland Upton, violatedChrissy's constitutional rights to due process and access tothe courts. Judge Barbour called one hearing perfunctory andsaid it fell &quot;woefully short of those basic features whichmark an adequate adjudicatory proceeding.&quot;   The federal judge was particularly critical of thehearings held after Chrissy's return from San Francisco. Hecited incidents in which the child was examined by a doctorwithout a guardian present and in which hearings were heldbut no formal transcripts made.   Judge Barbour, who is the chief federal judge in theSouthern District of Mississippi, has ordered a new custodyhearing from which he has barred Judge Dale and RefereeUpton.   Referee Upton said he would not appeal the decision. JudgeDale said through an assistant that he would not comment onthe matter. Jim Steel, the special assistant attorney generalwho argued against a new hearing, said his office had notdecided whether to appeal.   But, added Mr. Steel, &quot;these are state issues that shouldhave been appealed to state court.&quot; Mr. Upton agreed, sayingthat it was important for family matters to be decidedlocally. &quot;Most everybody knows everybody here,&quot; Mr. Uptonsaid.   Garnett Harrison, the attorney who represented Ms.Singley, said that's exactly the problem. She charged thatcourts dominated by white and &quot;upper-middle-class&quot; men makeit impossible for children, women and minorities to getjustice. Ms. Harrison, who two weeks ago was disbarred for atleast three years for allegedly advising Ms. Singley todisobey the custody order, likened her cause to that of civilrights activists who fought the Mississippi legal systemthree decades ago.   From a legal standpoint, the judge's decision, if itstands, could help carve out a new area of federalinvolvement in matters usually governed by state law. Federaljudges have traditionally stayed out of the area of familyrelations, lawyers say, because such matters are consideredparticularly well suited to handling at the most local level.   However, in recent years, increasing attention has beenfocused on the problem of child abuse, and lawyers havebecome more aggressive in battling allegations of abuse. As aresult of this case, any inadequacies in state-courtprotections for children are likely to come under closerscrutiny by the federal courts.   &quot;This ruling sends a message to all state judges of theirresponsibility for enforcing laws enacted to protectchildren,&quot; said Daniel S. Mason, an attorney who argued thecase on behalf of Chrissy's guardian from San Francisco. &quot;Ifnot, the federal court has a right to get involved.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
