Chase Peterson told state legislators that scientists havefailed to disprove the claims of chemists Martin Fleischmann andStanley Pons, who contend they have sustained nuclear fusion in atabletop experiment.   Peterson said others have failed to duplicate the resultsbecause the experiment is difficult and takes time.   ``There has been no disproving data,'' Peterson said. ``The workhas been described as simple, but it's really very difficultelectrochemistry.'''   In separate state House and Senate appearances, universityofficials said Pons, a Utah professor, and Fleischmann, of theUniversity of Southampton, in England, continue to report dramaticresults.   James Brophy, the university's vice president for research, saidthe experiment produces 100 times the energy needed to run it.Pons' goal is a 1,000-to-1 ratio, Brophy said.   When they announced their discovery at a March 23 newsconference, Pons and Fleischmann said they had achieved 4-to-1ratio.   Levels have been boosted by a change in the apparatus,specifically an increase in the size of the palladium electrode,Brophy said.   Legislators, who last month voted overwhelmingly to appropriate$5 million to support the research, offered no criticism of theclaims.   Peterson said a small portion of the $5 million has been spenton patent research and applications. The rest is in escrow until anindependent panel of scientists and businessmen decides theexperiment has been confirmed.   Pons and Fleischmann have been derided by other scientists fortheir claim. If fusion, which powers the sun, can be created atroom temperature, it could be a cheap and safe source of energy.   Peterson said Pons and Fleischmann must ignore the public debateand focus on their research. Without elaborating, he dismissed thechance of fundamental laboratory errors as a 1 in 100 possibility.   Peterson also said private corporations continue to show astrong interest in the project, with 45 companies having e signedconfidential disclosure agreements that permit them to review theschool's patent applications.   He declined to identify any of the companies exceptWestinghouse, which has acknowledged sending its officials to theUtah campus to review the project.</TEXT></DOC>
