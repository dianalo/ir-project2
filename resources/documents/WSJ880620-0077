The government's move marks the first time the Netherlands has revised its 74-year-old Bourse Supervison Act and was the second step taken since 1985 to more closely regulate the country's active and easily accessible securities markets. Three years ago, the government set minimum licensing standards to prohibit unscrupulous and unqualified brokerages from setting up shop.    The new oversight agency and the overhaul of trading rules was hammered out during several months of talks between the finance ministry and the three main Dutch securities exchanges -- the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the European Options Exchange and the Amsterdam Financial Futures Market.    The securities agency is expected to be organized and running &quot;within a short time,&quot; the finance ministry said. It will assume many of the regulatory activities previously held by the ministry. But the securities exchanges will be allowed to retain their previous authority to set trading rules and to govern day-to-day trading in their own market sector, Dutch investment industry officials said.    The creation of the new agency also will help the Netherlands share information and assist foreign authorities in fighting securities fraud. </TEXT></DOC>
