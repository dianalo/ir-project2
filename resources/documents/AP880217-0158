Bouza is one of four finalists for police commissioner inSuffolk County, N.Y., east of New York City on Long Island.   He has been a outspoken critic of the NRA and its stand on guncontrol, and is a leading critic of a proposed``right-to-bear-arms'' amendment to the Minnesota Constitution,which is supported by the NRA.   ``We have no feeling one way or the other as far as the othercandidates are concerned,'' said Dick Sorrentino, an NRA fieldrepresentative for New York and New Jersey. ``Suffolk County hasproblems to begin with as far as pistol licensing goes. It's veryrestrictive. We certainly don't need someone with (Bouza's)feelings on gun ownership in charge of pistol licensing.   ``Bouza's made his stand very publicly and we couldn't ignoreit,'' Sorrentino said. ``We had to make our feelings known.''   Other finalists are Anthony Voelker, a 35-year veteran on theNew York City Police Department; Daniel Guido, chief of police inStamford, Conn.; and Martin O'Connor, chief of Long Island's NassauCounty police support division.   The NRA has more than 25,000 members in Suffolk County. But BradO'Hearn, a spokesman for Suffolk County Executive Patrick Halpin,said the NRA's telephone and letter-writing campaign is unlikely toinfluence Halpin's decision on a new police commissioner. Thatdecision is expected next week.   Bouza's third term as Minneapolis police chief expires at theend of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
