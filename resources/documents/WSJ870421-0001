The official, who declined to be identified, refused to elaborate on the sale.    The issue of selling the computers to the warring Persian Gulf nation was resolved by the National Security Council after a controversy in which the Commerce Department favored the sale, the Pentagon opposed it and the State Department initially was undecided. The Commerce Department had insisted that the equipment was non-strategic in nature. The Digital Equipment gear had been valued at $1.4 million.    Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, testifying last month before a Senate Banking subcommittee, asserted that the U.S. has no strong reason under existing regulations to deny Digital Equipment the right to sell three low-level computers through a Swiss vendor to the Iranian press agency and to a Tehran electric power company.    Stephen Bryen, undersecretary of defense for trade security policy, has charged that the equipment could help Iran spread &quot;propaganda against the U.S. all over the Persian Gulf.&quot;    The trade restrictions were imposed in 1984 by the U.S., which said they were designed to retaliate against Iran for supporting international terrorism. They generally have been interpreted to forbid shipments of all weapons and munitions to Iran while barring exports of goods with both military and civilian uses -- such as computers -- only if it can be shown that the ultimate users are the Iranian military. </TEXT></DOC>
