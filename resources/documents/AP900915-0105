Post owner Peter Kalikow said the 505,000-circulation paperknown for its racy headlines would have to close Saturday withoutunion concessions because it has been losing $27 million a year.   Ten of the New York Post's 11 unions agreed late Friday to a $19million concession package that would eliminate jobs and shortenwork weeks.   The holdout was the Newspape Guild, which represents 352white-collar employees, mainly reporters and advertising staff. Itsnegotiating committee voted 7-3 to reject the concession deal.   ``They were saying, `Shut it down,''' said Thomas Pennacchio,secretary-treasurer of Guild Local 3.   Kalikow said the paper would publish until the Guild's membersvoted on the concessions. A vote on whether to accept eliminationof 43 jobs and four work days a week was scheduled for Monday.   ``I feel optimistic that when the members see it they willapprove it,'' said Post owner Peter Kalikow. ``If they turn itdown, the paper will stop publishing immediately.''   The Post said in Saturday's editions the concessions from its960 employees include 100 fewer truck driver jobs, down from 263;its 70 printers cutting to a four-day work week and five fewerpaper handlers, cutting from a staff of 17.   After the agreement was announced, a cheer erupted in the Post'snewsroom, where workers had gathered for what might have been theirfinal edition. Two versions were prepared and newsroom scuttlebuttpredicted the ``BANG, WE'RE DEAD'' headline if no agreement hadbeen reached.   The Post, founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1801, was sold toheiress Dorothy Schiff in 1939. Australian media baron RupertMurdoch bought it in 1976 and sold it to Kalikow in 1988.   The possible salvation of the 189-year-old paper aside, onewriter chafed at the idea of a four-day work week.   ``What am I supposed to do, drive a cab on the fifth day?''Peter Moses said.   Guild president Barry Lipton, who supported the offer, said ``Itwas the best we could make. ... I hope that the sense of themembership is to swallow what may be a bitter pill.''   Drivers gathered at the Post loading dock Saturday, angry overlooming cuts and Kalikow's tactics.   ``Today is no celebration,'' said driver Stan Infante. ``Peopleare losing jobs.''</TEXT></DOC>
