Such a bid would compete with an existing tender offer of40 cents on the dollar from Chicago investor Sam Zell's&quot;vulture fund,&quot; for Carter Hawley bonds and other debt.</LP><TEXT>   Irwin Gold, managing director with the firm of Houlihan,Lokey Howard and Zukin -- which is advising the Carter Hawleycreditors committee -- declined to say who is seeking thedata.   So did a Carter Hawley spokesman, who confirmed that twopotential bidders have signed confidentiality agreements andare being provided information.   The fact that two parties were curious enough to seekconfidential data is far from a sure-fire indicator that analternative bid will surface. But Mr. Gold said the committeeis &quot;urging unsecured creditors to consider waiting until thelast possible moment before making a decision as to whetherto tender&quot; under the current offer from Zell/Chilmark FundL.P.   Carter Hawley, the West Coast's largest retailer, has beenoperating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since earlythis year. In July, Zell/Chilmark made its discounted bid for$550 million of Carter Hawley bonds and supplier claims; ifthe bid succeeds, the fund would become Carter Hawley'slargest creditor, and most likely the company's largestshareholder when Carter emerges from bankruptcy.   Zell/Chilmark said yesterday that papers the Carter Hawleycreditors committee filed Friday with the U.S. BankruptcyCourt in Los Angeles &quot;raised no substantive legal opposition&quot;to certain pending requests by Zell/Chilmark and by CarterHawley, and called the filing &quot;constructive.&quot;   Those requests ask the bankruptcy court to issue ordersthat would both grant the fund certain protections regardingthe claims sought by the tender offer, and approve the termsof a loan agreement under which Zell/Chilmark would provideCarter Hawley as much as $50 million for store modernization.The requests are to be heard next Monday.   The creditors' filing with the court, in fact, only seeks&quot;certain procedural safeguards&quot; that it says &quot;must beincluded in order to be fair to creditors generally and toothers that might be interested in making a competing bid.&quot;   If the court issues the orders, Zell/Chilmark said in arelease late yesterday, the fund will extend its pendingtender offer for one week from the current Sept. 16 deadline,to permit debtholders more time to decide whether they willtender their claims.</TEXT></DOC>
