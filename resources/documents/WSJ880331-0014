Unless homeowners can identify the specific manufacturer of the asbestos product used in their home, they must pay for removal of the suspected carcinogen from ceilings, walls, pipes and ventilation ducts, the court said in a decision that upheld an earlier ruling by the Contra Costa County Superior Court.    The decision by the California First District Court of Appeal came in a class-action suit by three northern California homeowners who sued 75 asbestos makers for the cost of removing asbestos from their homes. The asbestos makers included Wayne, N.J.-based GAF Corp. and Fibreboard Corp., a unit of Portland, Ore.-based Louisiana-Pacific Corp.    In its decision, the court refused to extend the &quot;market share&quot; theory of liability to asbestos products. That theory was created from a 1980 California state court case that said women who suffered injuries as a result of their mothers' use of the pregnancy drug DES could force manufacturers to divide the cost of medical liabilities in proportion to their share of the DES market. The theory was based on the idea that women had no way of knowing which drug company manufactured their supply of DES, an indistinguishable product.    The court rejected homeowner arguments that asbestos products were similarly indistinguishable because it is effectively impossible to trace the source of asbestos installed decades ago. The court ruled that homeowners should be able to identify a specific maker and must sue that company individually. </TEXT></DOC>
