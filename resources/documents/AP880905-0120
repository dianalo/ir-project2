(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker made an 11th-hourplea to supporters Monday for help in raising a $3 million downpayment in his bid to return to the ministry he left amid asex-and-money scandal.   ``I'm not going to leave any stone unturned,'' Bakker said in atelephone interview with The Associated Press. ``I'm not going tostumble now.''   Bakker said friends and acquaintances have so far contributedclose to $2 million in cash and letters of credit toward the $3million he needs by Tuesday.   He said a group of people is working on raising the remaining $1million in thousand-dollar pledges and he has set up a trustaccount at a Hendersonville, N.C., bank to accept donations. Thosedonations would be used only if he and his wife, Tammy Faye,succeed in purchasing the ministry, he said.   Bakker said he has raised the money and pledges by word-of-mouth.   ``We are sort of running our own Labor Day telethon without atelevision station,'' he said.   PTL Bankruptcy Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton asked for the moneyas a sign of Bakker's ability to follow through on the $165 millionoffer he's made for the Heritage USA Christian theme park, asatellite network and undeveloped property near the Fort Millministry.   Bakker so far leads the bidding for buying assets of theministry that went into bankruptcy soon after he left PTL in March1987.   But Benton said Friday he was ``very, very skeptical'' Bakkercould come up with the $3 million letter of credit by Tuesday.Calls to Benton's Winston-Salem, N.C., home Monday went unanswered.   After Tuesday, Benton said he would consider other offers topurchase the ministry's assets. U.S. Bankrupty Judge Rufus Reynoldshas instructed Benton to recommend a buyer by Saturday.   Bakker attorney Jim Toms said Bakker expects to have the whole$3 million by Tuesday. But he said he plans to ask Benton to accept$1 million in cash and a $500,000 letter of credit, so that theremaining funds could be used to pay immediate operating expenses.   Bakker said a Midwest bank has agreed to handle the funds fromunidentified Greek investors he says are backing his offer to buyPTL. He also said he has several other banks are willing to aid hisbid, but he would not identify the banks.   ``We're almost there,'' Bakker said.</TEXT></DOC>
