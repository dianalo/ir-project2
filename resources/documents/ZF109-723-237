(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>FAULT TOLERANCE: A STRONG SECOND TEAMandM;Ensuring that data is never at risk, no matter what the conditions, is amajor goal for many system managers.andP;  Unfortunately, the cost of installingthe hardware and software needed to achieve this goal has tended to makefault-tolerant systems a prerogative of the rich.andM;But in an increasing number of businesses, the escalating costs of downtimeare leading MIS managers to consider fault-tolerant computing a necessityrather than a luxury.andM;According to industry analysts' estimates, customers must pay a 30 percent to100 percent premium for a fully fault-tolerant system.andP;  These systems areequipped with backup components for every possible source of hardwarefailure.andP;  If any part of a computer fails, such as the CPU, power supply oreven cables, another component can take over.andM;High-availability systems such as VAXcluster, which constitute the chiefalternative to true fault-tolerant systems, are equally expensive.andO;High-availability systems have mirrored disks as well as locking mechanismsthat allow work to be distributed across multiple processors.andM;If one processor in a VAXcluster fails, only the work that hasn't been backedup on that particular processor needs to be recovered.andP;  The VAX-cluster'stransition state, during which it switches from failed to functioningcomponents, can last from 20 seconds to four minutes, depending on theconfiguration and application.andM;DEC's high-availability VAXclusters are generally priced about the same as,and sometimes higher than, other vendors' fully redundant fault-tolerantsystems.andP;  DEC officials acknowledged that the company's high-availabilitysystems often cost more than fault-tolerant systems, but said thathigh-availability systems offer greater glexibility than fault-tolerantsystems regarding changes in the way that applications are set up.andM;To determine how much money to invest in a fault-tolerant system, MISmanagers must balance the prices of various fault-tolerant computingalternatives against the costs that downtime exacts in their particularorganizations.andM;Downtime expenses can include the cost of lost business opportunities, aswell as delayed or wasted labor and manufacturing time.andP;  In manufacturingenvironments, losses can include reductions in the number of manufacturedparts during downtime and any resulting domino effect that might be imposedon related manufacturing schedules.andP;  Downtime in a computer-controlledprocess manufacturing environment can also increase costs when, for example,temperatures drop in chemical vats or ingredients aren't added at theappropriate time.andM;In a telemarketing business, downtime can be equated to calls not made.andP;  Theresult: fewer sales during the downtime while wages are paid to idle workers.andO;And then there's the possibility of losing customers because of a lack ofservice.andM;When business customers are kept waiting--and waiting--because a computer isdown, the direct financial and subtle customer-relations costs can quicklysurpass the price of deploying a full-fledged fault-tolerant system.andM;For example, consider a computer that hosts a small network of automatedteller machines (ATMs) and handles an average of 10 transactions per second.andO;If the computer goes down for two minutes, and the bank charges 50 cents pertransaction, the bank could potentially lose $600 worth of business duringthat two-minute crash.andP;  If half of the ATM customers wait for the hostcomputer to come back up or find a working bank machine that belongs to thesame bank, and the other half find other ways to access their funds, the bankcould still lose $300 during that two-minute period.andM;To determine their fault-tolerance requirements, customers need to be awareof the cost of downtime for their organizations.andP;  Today's computers thataren't fault-tolerant generally have an uptime rating of about 99.7 percentof operating time, according to research by the Aberdeen Group, aBoston-based market research and consulting company.andP;  However, that 0.3percent downtime can exact a hefty toll.andP;  A 99.7 percent uptime figure meansthere are 1.095 days, or 1,576.8 minutes, of downtime per year.andP;  (See&quot;Average annual system downtime,&quot; above.)andM;At an average of $300 lost per minute, a bank could lose an average of$473,040 annually due to computer system downtime.andP;  For a10-transaction-per-second computer, that translates to $47,304 per yeartransaction per second.andM;According to research by the Meta Group, a market research company based inWestpot, Conn., the cost of acquiring a fault-tolerant system for OLTPenvironments ranges from $5,000 to $50,000 per transaction per second.andP;  Thecost depends on the type of systems needed, applications, transaction rates,available tools, the database used, decision-support requirements and type ofredundancy needed.andM;According to Aberdeen Group research, conventional computer systems have a99.74 percent uptime rating, an increase of 1.74 percent over the 98 percentreliability rating of two years ago.andP;  But conventional computer systems thatlack fault-tolerant or high-availability features need between five minutesto 15 minutes to reconfigure after faulty hardware components are replaced.andO;And the several hours that MIS managers sometimes need to obtain and installreplacement hardware could easily dwarf the reconfiguration time.andM;Depending on the level of fault tolerance in its computer systems, a typicalcompany can project three likely results from a computer component's failure.andM;Conside, for instance, a telemarketing company losing its power supply onedark and stormy afternoon.andP;  The following scenarious could occur:andM;Take one: The company has conventional computer systems.andP;  It finishesreplacing the power supply four hours after losing power, and the computer isup and running again.andP;  During the four-hour downtime, the company's 200employees couldn't access the company database.andP;  They answered all telephonecalls, but had to ask customers to call back later.andM;Take two: The company has a high-availability system.andP;  When the power supplyfails and takes the company system down with it, another machine on theVAXcluster takes over the downed CPU's operations.andP;  Just two minutes elapsebefore the failed system is up and running again.andM;Take three: The company has a fault-tolerant system.andP;  Users don't notice thepower-supply failure or the millisecond needed to switch to a redundant powersupply, nor must they wait for repair personnel to show up and replace thefailed power supply unit.andM;Buyers should assess their data safety needs carefully to determine whetherthey need redundant fault-tolerant or high-availability systems, however.andO;Some applications might only require mirrored disk drives, which prevent theloss of large amounts of data in the event of a drive failure.andM;OLTP applications, on the other hand, are inherently time-critical and sufferterribly from downtime, and generally can benefit substantially from theimplementation of fault-tolerance measures.andM;As mentioned earlier, fault-tolerant systems require the payment of asubstantial premium beyond bare-essential computing costs.andM;For example, a twin-CPU system from Cupertino, Calif.'s Tandem Computers,using the same R2000 chip included with DEC's single-processor, $60,000 DECsystem 5800 line, is priced at approximately $180,000--three times theDECsystem 5800's list price.andM;To construct a system without any level of fault tolerance, an MIS managerwould simply purchase however many CPU's his or her applications and usersrequire.andP;  At minimum, according to Aberdeen Group research, constructing afault-tolerant or high-availability system adds the expense of including oneextra CPU in the system--the spare in case another CPU goes flat.andM;These types of fault-tolerant and high-availability systems, known asnumber-of-CPUs-plus-one (N+1) systems, usually require that 10 percent of asystem's overhead be dedicated to maintaining internal communications amongthe spare hardware components and system software components, according toAberdeen Group research.andM;For fully redundant systems, in which each computer component has a sparerunning constantly, system software is generally less complex than for N+1systems.andP;  Between just 3 percent and 10 percent of system resources aredevoted to internal communications, according to Aberdeen Group research.andM;Four computer vendors currently manufacture fully fault-tolerant systems:DECandgt; Sequoia Systems of Marlborough, Mass.andgt; Stratus Computer, also ofMarlboroughandgt; and Tandem Computers.andP;  In addition, IBM and Hewlett-Packardresell Stratus and Sequoia fault-tolerant systems, respectively.andM;GRIPPING THE GRAPEVINEandM;Establishing fully redundant systems involves more than simply duplicating oradding extra platform components.andP;  To ensure that data can be accessed nomatter which systems components break, MIS managers must also take steps toensure that any networks their systems use are also fault-tolerant.andM;This means providing alternate routes for data to travel if a network goesdown.andP;  According to some MIS managers, two extra paths are needed for fullfault tolerance.andM;A good strategy, the MIS managers suggested, is to use each of the threepaths actively, with each operating at about 50 percent capacity.andP;  If onenetwork link fails, either of the two remaining paths can easily pick up theslack.andM;When redundant networks include commercial phone lines, MIS managers mustmake sure redundant lines travel through different central switchingstations.andP;  Case in point: a fire in a Chicago telephone switching station twoyears ago took out several companies' supposedly redundant networks.andM;In extremely sensitive environments, an MIS manager might even want to ensureredundancy all the way to the desk top.andP;  That is, the manager might want toconstruct a fault-tolerant system that includes alternate network paths thatfeed into different servers as well as extra end-user terminals.andM;Other MIS managers might be willing to make do if a server or terminal fails,to avoid the extra cost of keeping redundant servers and terminals on hand.andM;Another important aspect of fault tolerance involves a computer system'spower supply.andP;  Most fault-tolerant systems have enough battery power tofunction for a short period until normal power sources are restored, and thenthe backup power supply gracefully shuts down.andP;  Other systems have enoughinternal juice to run at full capacity for 30 minutes or so.andP;  But having atrue duplicate power source usually means purchasing a powergenerator--another additional cost.andM;There are other advantages to fully fault-tolerant systems.andP;  For instance,because fully fault-tolerant platforms can run at all times, they actuallysave maintenance time: System managers don't have to take systems down andthen bring them back up when performing routine maintenance.andM;This can also save money for companies whose service providers penalize themwhenever machines must be taken down.andM;Because maintenance contracts are usually based on purchase price, however,some of these savings could be lost.andP;  In such cases, the higher cost offault-tolerant systems results in more expensive maintenance contracts.andM;Several years ago, fault-tolerant systems were generally used only when oneof two things were at stake: the successful transfer of large sums of money,or the lives of human beings.andP;  At that time, fault-tolerant technology wasused primarily by systems supporting large banks or air-traffic controlstations.andM;Today, fault-tolerant computing is finding homes well outside of itstraditional niches.andP;  The bottom line is that system managers must determineexactly what it i s worth to their companies to avoid downtime.andM;One rule of thumb, according to manufacturers of fault-tolerant systems, isif downtime costs the user more than $500 a minute, fault-tolerant equipmentwould be in order.andM;But MIS managers who want some degree of fault tolerance, yet can handle,say, four-minute interruptions that affect a significant number ofoperations, might want to consider implementing a high-availability systemthat has as its front end a fault-tolerant system for critical applications.andM;In general, the level of fault tolerance required is often based on theamount of pressure put on the MIS manager to keep the system up and runningat full availability during a certain time period.andM;But in most cases, the ultimate cost-justification for fault-tolerantsystems--whatever their form--depends on how a company assesses downtime intoday's competitive business climate.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
