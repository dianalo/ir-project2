The experiments were covered in ranges of Reynoldsnumber based on the mean diameter of spherical particles packed Re/subd/ = 10.3-2200, porosity {epsilon} = 0.310 to 0.475, ratio of sphericalparticle diameter to cylinder diameter d/D = 0.0075-0.177 and ratio oflength of the cylinder to cylinder diameter L/D = 2.5-10. It was foundthat especially the flow rate and the dimension of spherical particlesplayed an important role in estimating the transient local heat transfercharacteristics near the wall of the cylindrical vessel in the presentheat storage system. As flow rate and diameter of spherical particleswere increased under a given diameter of the cylinder heat storage vessel,the mean heat transfer coefficient between the flow cold air and thehot spherical particles increased and the time period to finish removingheat from the vessel reduced. In addition, the useful experimental correlationequations of mean heat transfer coefficient between both phases and thetime period to finish removing heat from the vessel were derived withthe functional relationship of Nusselt number Nu/sub d/ = f [modifiedPrandtl number Pr/sup */, (d/D), Re/sub d/] and Fourier number Fo = f(d/D, L/D, Pr/sup */, Re/sub d/).</TEXT></DOC>
