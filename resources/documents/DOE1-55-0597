For example, uranium occurs in threemineralogical locales: 1. as background in quartz, fresh biotite andfeldspars; 2. in resistate accessory minerals which contribute the greatestconcentration of uranium, and 3. as minerals formed during hydrothermalalteration. Alteration minerals are dominated by Fe carbonates and oxidesand Ti oxides (? anatase and secondary sphene), with chlorite and clays(phengite and sericite). The fission track distribution is mostly non-uniformand may be affected by further alteration indicating the dominant mechanismfor fixation of uranium as adsorption and ionic exchange. These mineralsare found replacing biotite or infilling fractures throughout the rock.Of these distributions, uranium associated with secondary minerals providesthe most appropriate far-field analogue. Preliminary leach tests indicatepreferential adsorption of 239-Pu from 239-Pu doped SYNROC onto thesesecondary alteration phases.</TEXT></DOC>
