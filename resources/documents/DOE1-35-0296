Beam probes are also either being designedor under consideration for stellarator type devices in Japan and theSoviet Union. The primary purpose for this diagnostic on a stellaratoris direct determination of the plasma potential structure which is largelyresponsible for the particle drift surfaces in a nonaxisymmetric toroidalconfinement device. Beam probes have been successfully implemented ontokamaks and bumpy tori but the complex magnetic geometry of a stellaratorpresents some significant difficulties not encountered before. The helicalfield coils make it impossible to locate the input and output ports usedby the beam probe in the same toroidal plane. They are separated by 15degrees on ATF. There are also substantial return fields in the regionof the beam line optics and the electrostatic energy analyzer electricfields. The separation of the ports and the open field structure producesa large dispersion in ion trajectories. The design for the ATF systemhas successfully addressed these problems.</TEXT></DOC>
