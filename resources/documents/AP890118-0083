(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorneys want a federal judge to issue agag order in the fraud trial of former PTL leader Jim Bakker, whopleaded innocent to charges of diverting money donated by histelevision audience.   Bakker's lawyer, George T. Davis, asked for the order at the TVevangelist's arraignment Tuesday in U.S. District Court.   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor told Davis and a Justice Departmentprosecutor to draft a proposed consent order after Davis citedconcerns over the comments of a retired federal bankruptcy judge whosupervised the sale of PTL assets.   Davis noted that the bankruptcy judge, Rufus Reynolds, had calledthe founder of the religious broadcasting empire a ``sawed-offlittle runt'' and ``a thief.''   ``We can't see how we can have a fair trial if we're innundatedwith pretrial negative publicity, especially from a federal judge,''Davis said. ``How can we prevent this? This guy is a loose cannon.He's already gone overboard.''   Bakker pleaded innocent at the hearing to 24 counts of mail andwire fraud and conspiracy. He and Richard Dortch, 57, his former topdeputy at PTL, are accused of conspiring to defraud PTL contributorsand divert more than $4 million in PTL money for their personal use.Dortch pleaded innocent last week.   ``I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment,''Bakker said after his arraignment. ``The judge asked for noconversations about this case, but I'd like to say that Tammy and Iare thrilled to be back on TV.''   The Bakkers began broadcasting ``The Jim and Tammy Show'' fromtheir leased home near Charlotte earlier this month. Bakker didn'tappear on the telecast Tuesday and his wife, Tammy Faye, handled theprogram alone.</TEXT></DOC>
