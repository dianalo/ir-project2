Similar legislation is pending in theHouse of Representatives.   The vote was 19-3 with one abstention.   Most senators favoring the bill spoke of the dangers nuclearweapons pose. The three opposed said the law would cause problemswith the United States over the future of Clark Air Base, the SubicBay naval base and smaller U.S. installations in the country.   Sen. Edgardo Angara abstained and said the Senate should considerthe position of President Corazon Aquino, who has pledged to respectthe bases agreement until it expires in 1991 and to keep optionsopen on an extension.   In Washington, the State Department sharply criticized the bill.   ``As drafted, the bill would permit no flexibility on nuclearmatters and would be incompatible with our policy of neitherconfirming nor denying the presence or absence of nuclear weapons onU.S. vessels, aircraft and facilities,'' said deputy spokeswomanPhyllis Oakley.   There was no indication when the House would debate its versionof the bill. Mrs. Aquino can veto legislation, but Congress canoverride the veto by two-thirds vote of each chamber.   Opposition to nuclear weapons and to the American bases isbelieved to be stronger in the Senate than in the 200-member House.   The United States opposes any prohibitions that curtail theability of its ships and planes to carry nuclear weapons. It hasobjected to similar measures in New Zealand and Denmark.   Provisions of the Philippine bill set prison terms of up to 30years for bringing nuclear weapons into the country, and up to 12years for importing nuclear components.   Supporters said the measure is directed at the six U.S.installations where nuclear weapons are believed to be stored. TheUnited States will not confirm or deny whether it has nuclearweapons in the Philippines, or whether a ship or aircraft carriesthem.   Sen. Wigberto Tanada, the chief sponsor, said the law would forceU.S. authorities to respect the Philippine constitution, whichprescribes a policy of freedom from nuclear weapons ``consistentwith the national interest.''   He also said it would contribute ``to the ongoing process fordetente, denuclearization and disarmament in this part of theworld.''   Jovito Salonga, the Senate president, said: ``The Philippinesshould not be a promoter of the deadly arms race. We should never bepart of the problem. We should be part of the solution.''   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile said he supported the bill toprotest the Aquino government's ``inaction'' on the constitutionalnuclear ban and because ``the presence of nuclear weapons in ourterritory is inconsistent with the national interest.''   The bill forbids storage or transit of nuclear weapons and theentry of nuclear-armed ships or aircraft, but it allows port callsby nuclear-powered commercial and research vessels after inspectionby Philippine authorities.   U.S. officials have said such a law would severely limit Americanmilitary operations, particularly those of the Navy at the Subic Baybase northwest of Manila.   Under the new constitution, any extension of the bases agreementmust take the form of a treaty approved by a two-thirds vote of theSenate. The Philippine Congress also can require a referendum.   Philippine and U.S. officials began a review of the agreement inApril.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told a House committee Monday theanti-nuclear bill was ``not completely satisfactory'' and requestedamendments that would give Mrs. Aquino greater flexibility in thematter and in her dealings with the United States.   Most of the weapons and equipment with which the Philippinemilitary fights a 19-year-old Communist insurgency come from theUnited States, the main ally of this Pacific archipelago of 7,100islands.</TEXT></DOC>
