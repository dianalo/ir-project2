Global Power Company (Global), a Delaware Corp.,(an affiliate of Park Co.) replaced the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)as operator in January 1989. The application was submitted pursuant tothe provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 USC 81a-81u),and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filedon October 23, 1989. Subzones 78C and 78D were approved by the Board on March 30, 1984, to allowTVA to defer duties on certain foreign-sourced nuclear power plant equipmentpurchased for power plants that were never built (Board Order 246, 49 FR13562). Approval was granted for five years (3-30-89), during which timeTVA had expected to sell the equipment. In 1988, TVA executed an agreementwith Global and its affiliate Park Company (Park), pursuant to which Parkpurchased the equipment and Global applied to become operator. Park plannedto sell the equipment to foreign customers. Based on a request from thePort Authority on behalf of Park, the Board approved a time extension ofsubzone status until December 31, 1989 for Subzone 78D, and October 25,1993 for Subzone 78C (Board Order 413, 53 FR 51575).  The Port Authorityis now requesting that the time limit for Subzone 78D be extended to October25, 1993. This would give Park additional time to sell the equipment atthat site.
