An expansion valve will be used to simulatea power turbine to evaluate system operation. To date, economic developmentof this geothermal resource has been inhibited by severe technical problems,primarily scaling buildup in equipment exposed to the highly concentratedbrines. As a result of tests conducted during the past several years,SDG and E has designed a heat transfer system which, if successful, willpermit utilization of this resource.</TEXT></DOC>
