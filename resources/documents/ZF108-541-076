 Filecompatibility, documentation and user interface ranked almost as high inimportance to users.andM;Judging by this survey, federal offices seem to be moving slowly intonetworked databases.andP;  Only four network packages received enough responses tobe statistically significant, compared with 17 packages in the two precedingsurveys of entry-level and full-featured database managers.andM;However, the respondents were not at all reluctant to say what they value ina network DBMS.andM;&quot;One very important feature in the government is running within 640K,&quot; areader said.andP;  &quot;The majority of users want a multiuser package that can runnetwork and database in 640K without crashing.&quot;andM;Another reader pointed out the complexities of several programs on a network,saying, &quot;There are enough variables in a network environment to confuse thenetwork administrator, let alone the user.andP;  Data corruption sources must beidentified immediately and the solutions communicated to all users on thenetwork so problems don't recur.&quot;andM;John Auman, a computer specialist with the Defense Department InspectorGeneral's office in Arlington, Va., warned that creating networked databaseapplications is far more difficult than creating stand-alone applications.andM;&quot;It has to be done right or the network will bog down,&quot; Auman said.andP;  &quot;Networkdatabase applications are not something you want inexperienced programmers todesign.&quot;andM;Many of the Oracle users said their prime reason for choosing it was the manydifferent platforms on which it can run.andP;  One called Oracle &quot;excellent -- [anapplication] can be uploaded to our VAX Oracle and it still works.andP;  Theproductivity of our programmers has increased.&quot;andM;Another, although acknowledging the package's popularity, said it has a longlearning curve: &quot;Oracle is becoming a standard on mainframes, minicomputersand some PCs.andP;  Although it would be good for the government to have astandard, my experience is that it takes longer to train someone to beproficient in Oracle than in other database programs.&quot;andM;Although Oracle is on its way to becoming the de facto standard at the Foodand Drug Administration, a different package serves FDA in the interim untila PC-based Oracle application is developed.andM;&quot;Our agency is moving to standardize on Oracle,&quot; wrote Frank Crumpler,director of management information at FDA in Rockville, Md.andP;  &quot;One of the mainreasons is the multiple platform capability.andP;  We operate on an IBM [Corp.]andO;mainframe cluster, a [Digital Equipment Corp.] VAXcluster and PCs.andO;Eventuallty, applications involving imaging will have an Oracle front end forretrieval.andM;&quot;Oracle is pretty much our future in terms of networking everything together,but developing PC networking applications here has been relatively slow,&quot;Crumpler said.andM;&quot;We pound that [Redmond, Wash.-based Microrim Inc.'s] R:Base for DOS wasadequate for our needs, and it certainly was easier to learn.&quot;andM;Although R:Base for DOS did not receive enough responses to be included inthe final results, it did get several favorable comments from users.andM;&quot;We already had R:Base on the division's PCs,&quot; a user wrote.andP;  &quot;We were quitepleased with the package already and wondered how it would work on an IBMToken-Ring network.andP;  Initially, there were a few problems, but Microrim andIBM representatives were a big help.andP;  R:Base in a network environment worksfine.&quot;andM;Another reader's organization relies on single-user Enable from EnableSoftware Inc., Ballston Lake, N.Y., but chose Oracle for networking becauseit runs on many UNIX platforms.andM;&quot;We use Enable Version 2.00 in a NetBIOS local area network, but I am notaware of any networked Enable DBMS applications,&quot; the reader said.andP;  &quot;Weselected Oracle for application development.andP;  We export to a number of Navybases and stations.andP;  Our applications are developed using OracleClient/Server architecture on the ATandamp;T 3B2/600G [server] and Zenith 248 PCs.andO;Oracle provides portability and a robust development environment.andP;  We haveconcerns about speed and cost, however.&quot;andM;Ashton-Tate Corp.'s network entries, dBase IV and III Plus, ranked second andthird overall with less than one point separating the two.andP;  One respondentcalled dBase III Plus &quot;the workhorse.andP;  I have used it to develop systemwideapplications as well as local ones.&quot;andM;Users of fourth-place Enable found that package's on-line help the mostsatisfactory of all, and they gave it the best marks for overall value.andM;One military reader commented, &quot;Enable and dBase III Plus are the most commonprograms in my area of operations.andP;  They are easy to teach simply because somany soldiers and civilians are experienced with at least part of eachprogram.andP;  A very large user base exists.andP;  &quot;My personal favorite is Enable,although it has the worst documentation I've ever seen.andP;  However,after-market documentation saves the day.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
