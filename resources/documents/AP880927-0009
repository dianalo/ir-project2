The announcement Monday by EPA administrator Lee M. Thomasmarked a shift from his view that there was plenty of time toconsider what, if any, steps were needed to tighten the terms of anexisting international treaty on reducing CFC production.   That treaty, signed by 45 major nations, pledges signatories toa 50 percent cut by 1998.   The CFC compounds are widely used as refrigeration fluids,solvents and foam blowing agents and, outside the United States, asaerosol propellants. Related bromine compounds are used in fireextinguishers. Some can last for more than a century, rising to thestratosphere where they eventually break down to liberate chlorine.   A major study of ozone by the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration last March found ozone depletion of as much as 3percent at mid-latitudes and attributed it to chlorine.   Without cutting off production of CFCs, chlorine and brominewill continue to build up in the atmosphere, destroyinghigh-altitude ozone that protects the Earth from the sun'sultra-violet rays, the EPA said in a new analysis released Monday.   ``It is increasingly clear that we as a global environmentalcommunity must use the (treaty) to go even further to eliminatethese chemicals which damage the stratospheric ozone layer andthreaten our future,'' Thomas said in a statement.   ``Regretfully, our new analysis predicts an even worse scenariothan anticipated,'' he added.   Up to now, Thomas had resisted environmentalist recommendationsfor a CFC-phaseout. In his remarks Monday, Thomas mentioned nospecific timetable for a phase out.   David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council, anenvironmentalist group, said the EPA announcement ``underlines theseriousness of the emergency we are facing.''   Doniger predicted the report would ``have a lot of impact'' onmajor CFC producers abroad.   Also on Monday, the major trade association of CFC makers andusers, the Alliance for a Responsible CFC Policy, announced it,too, now believed the nations of the world should aim at ``phasingout ... CFCs to the maximum extent feasible.''   Kevin Fay, executive director of the users-producers group, saidthe phasing out approach probably would mean some CFCs wouldcontinue to be in use into the 21st century.   ``We will be working with other trade groups around the worldtrying to line up support'' for a phaseout of CDC production anduse, Fay said.   Environmentalist groups have suggested 1995 as a target date forending CFC production.   John Hoffman, co-author of the EPA analysis, said the failure ofcomputer models to predict past ozone depletion leads EPA to shyaway from ozone predictions and to zero in on chlorine buildupinstead. Any increases in chlorine raise the risk of ozonedepletion, he said.   Currently, EPA estimates worldwide atmospheric chlorine at 2.7parts per billion. Others last year put the figure at 3 parts perbillion, which represents about a 25 percent increase in the pastdecade. By some estimates, half the total comes from naturalsources such as sea spray.   In the past, EPA has said an immediate 85 percent reduction inthe major CFC compounds would be needed to keep chlorine fromrising.   But those estimates did not include non-CFC chemicals that yieldchlorine, notably methyl chloroform, the most widely usedindustrial solvent. If use of that compound continues to grow, thecurrent level of chlorine in the atmosphere would triple by 2075,the EPA said. Even if the growth of methyl chloroform use washalted, the level of chlorine in the atmosphere would double by2075, it said.   ``An immediate 100 percent reduction in the use of all (of themost powerful) compounds and a freeze in methyl chloroform would beneeded'' by all countries to stabilize chlorine, EPA said. By``immediate,'' it said it meant 1990.   This would permit use of less powerful CFC compounds to growthroughout the next century while still holding the chlorineincrease to less than 1 part per billion by 2100.</TEXT></DOC>
