Icahn said Friday hewas forming a new holding company to act as his sole vehicle foracquisitions, including a possible hostile takeover bid for TexacoInc.   Icahn, Texaco's biggest shareholder, said the holding companyintended to raise up to $3.25 billion through an offering of $500million to $750 million in common stock and about $2.5 billion indebt securities.   The Icahn group of companies also will contribute equity to theholding company, including its 36.1 million shares of Texaco andits interests in Trans World Airlines Inc. and ACF, a leasingcompany.   In a news release issued late Friday, Icahn indicated thatacquisitions to be pursued by the new holding company included thepossible pursuit of Texaco, in which Icahn controls a 14.8 percentstake.   Texaco has rejected Icahn's proposal for a buyout of the companyfor $60 per common share, which values the company at $14.6 billion.   Icahn also is running himself and four colleagues for five boardseats up for election at the company's annual meeting in an attemptto pressure Texaco to let its shareholders vote on his buyout offer.   Icahn stated that if his slate was elected but a majority of theboard refused to allow a shareholder vote on the offer, he wouldconsider making a hostile bid through the new holding company atyet to be determined terms.   Texaco stock rose 62{ cents to $51.87{ a share Friday on the NewYork Stock Exchange.   A spokesman for the White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant saidTexaco had no immediate comment on Icahn's announcement.   Icahn has indicated previously that he might consider a hostilebid for Texaco, but had yet to make any public moves in thatdirection until Friday.   Separately, a federal judge in White Plains ordered Icahn'sproxy solicitors to stop making false statements in solicitingsupport from Texaco shareholders in the board election.   U.S. District Judge Gerard Goettel made the ruling after viewinga videotape of Thursday's MacNeil-Lehrer Report on the PublicBroadcasting System.   On the program, an unidentified employee of D.F. King, an Icahnproxy solicitor, said Icahn had $100 million in escrow to return toshareholders should he be unable to finance his takeover bid.   Icahn has stated that if Texaco put his $60 a share offer to ashareholder vote he would end his proxy fight and put the $100million in escrow, for payment to shareholders in the event hecould not arrange financing for the bid by the date of theshareholder vote. On Thursday, he raised the guarantee to $300million.   The money has not yet been placed in escrow, contrary to theD.F. King employee's remarks on the broadcast. Texaco sought anoutright correction, but Goettel said an evidentiary hearing musttake place first and only enjoined solicitors from making falseremarks.</TEXT></DOC>
