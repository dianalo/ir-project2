Gen. ProsperAvril said Monday that loyalist troops fired mostly blank shells toavoid casualties in a weekend assault on hundreds of rebel soldiersdug in at an army barracks.   ``We in the Presidential Guard are aware of our power, but wenever wanted to use it against our brothers,'' the president saidat a news conference at the National Palace.   Avril said that due to restraint on the part of loyal troops,only six soldiers were killed in the fighting Friday and Saturday,although a seventh died Sunday trying to recover an undetonatedgrenade.   He said one civilian was killed in the crossfire, and 75 peoplewere wounded _ 43 soldiers and 32 civilians.   Independent but unconfirmed reports earlier said 30 soldiers andfour civilians were killed. There had been no firm estimate ofwounded.   In another development, two deserters from the DessalinesBarracks, one of the two mutinous units, hijacked a twin-engineaircraft carrying a missionary group from Haiti to Fort Lauderdale,officials said. The plane was diverted to Miami before the twogunmen surrendered peacefully.   The two deserters boarded at Cap Haitien on Haiti's north coast.They were taken to FBI headquarters in Miami.   Soldiers of the 1,000-man Presidential Guard, based at theNational Palace, assaulted the 750-man Dessalines Barracks Fridaynight to crush a rebellion among soldiers demanding Avril's ouster.The president had narrowly escaped a military coup attempt theprevious Sunday, April 2.   Throughout Friday night and for much of Saturday, thePresidential Guard fired blank shells from howitzers and cannons atthe barracks ``to shake them and make them run,'' Avril said.   But he said the guard decided to launch a full-scale attack withlive ammunition after rebels seized control of a Roman Catholicseminary less than a mile away and lobbed mortar shells near thepalace, killing three soldiers.   Asked about the casualties among loyal and rebel troops, Avrilsaid, ``I am sad to the same extent about all of them.'' His voicerising and his eyes welling with tears, he said: ``We have theforce. We chose not to use it.''   Avril, surrounded by 50 helmeted and heavily armed soldiers,also would not say whether the Dessalines Barracks, which is widelyregarded as the most repressive in the 7,000-man Haititan army,would be disbanded.   ``The (army) High Command will study how to use the Dessalinessoldiers in the defense of this country,'' he said.   Foreign Minister Serge Elie Charles, speaking after the newsconference, said soldiers captured in the weekend assault wereallowed to return home and the government was holding no prisonersas a result of the operation.   He said the Dessalines were ordered to report to armyheadquarters on Tuesday for instructions.   Avril said the Leopards Battalion, the other unit that rebelledagainst the government last week, was no longer in revolt and thearmy command was negotiating with them over their grievances.   ``We won't say all the problems are resolved, but I think it iscoming,'' the president said, adding that 12 of the 414 soldiersattached to the commando unit had failed to return to base.   The Leopards had protested the government's dismissals ofseveral army officers in a crackdown on drug-running and corruptionin the army. Their former commander, Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, wasidentified as one of the four ringleaders of the coup attempt.   Avril repeated the government's accusation that the uprising wasled by Haitian exiles linked to the ousted regime of Jean ClaudeDuvalier, who fled into exile in France in February 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
