These ice-dust mixtures are possible analogues of materials of Martiannorth polar deposits. Low-density (0.002 g/cm{sup 3}) spheroidal pelletsformed from these materials in wind tunnel experiments have been examinedas possible candidates for forming north polar dunes on Mars. It is shownthat these particles move like sand grains under conditions of saltationand, given a sufficient supply, would be capable of forming the dunesobserved in the north circumpolar erg.</TEXT></DOC>
