Unlike money-market mutual funds, which maintain a fixed$1-a-share net asset value, bond funds fluctuate in value asinterest rates rise and fall. When rates go down, the valuegoes up; but when rates rise, the value declines.</LP><TEXT>   But most people investing in bond funds &quot;focus only onyield and don't focus on price risk,&quot; says S. Timothy Kochis,a San Francisco financial planner. &quot;They think that when theyneed their money it'll be there.&quot;   It might not be, at least not all of it -- depending onhow sensitive the bonds in a particular fund's portfolio areto interest rate moves.   For instance, if interest rates rise just one percentagepoint over the next year, an investor who put $10,000 into aTreasury bond fund yielding 7.7% would be left with $9,820,according to calculations by Vanguard Group.   Ian MacKinnon, senior vice president of the big ValleyForge, Pa., mutual fund company estimates that long-termfunds are four to five times as risky as short-term funds,because the price of short-term bonds fluctuates far less inresponse to interest rate changes.   Vanguard and other mutual fund companies are worried thatinvestors who don't understand the risks will panic and jumpship once interest rates start to rise, which is whathappened in the spring of 1987. &quot;I don't think that moneyever came back, even now,&quot; says Mr. MacKinnon.   As a result, fund groups have trained sales people toadvise prospective investors about the risks. Vanguard wentso far as to include a discussion of risks, with a tableillustrating the effects of changes in interest rates, in itslatest report to shareholders. &quot;We've been blowing the riskhorn to make sure people know what they're getting into,&quot;says Mr. MacKinnon.   Still, the money keeps pouring in. Just last week, theInvestment Company Institute, a mutual funds trade group,reported that investors added $7 billion to bond funds inAugust, slightly more than the $6.9 billion that went intothe funds in July. Fund groups say strong sales continued inSeptember.   Fund groups report that short-term and intermediate-termfunds have been attracting a substantial portion of the cashflowing into bond funds recently. One popular investment hasbeen Ginnie Mae funds, which invest in mortgage-backed bondsbacked by the Government National Mortgage Association.   What's more, if interest rates fall further, which somepeople think they will before rising again, there's thepotential for capital appreciation in bond funds.   &quot;If you think interest rates are going to go down, and ifyou're deliberately playing that move, then long-term bondfunds are a good place to be,&quot; says Mr. Kochis. &quot;The biggestproblem is that {investors} don't understand what the risksare.&quot;   But with interest rates at their lowest point in years,many people think they have nowhere to go but up. And even ifthey don't go up soon, rates will rise eventually. Theresulting drop in the return on their investment could comeas a severe shock to investors accustomed to the stability ofmoney funds.   To reduce the risk, a better choice would be short-term orintermediate-term funds. &quot;The intermediate sector is fairlylow risk, and you can pick up yield and price appreciationpotential,&quot; says Hugh R. Lamle, bond specialist with New Yorkmoney manager M.D. Sass Investors Services. &quot;You don't pickup that much more yield&quot; in return for the increased risk oflonger maturities, he says.   Many intermediate-term bond funds, which typically investin securities maturing in five to 10 years, currently yieldtwo percentage points more than the average money fund.Longer-term funds, with the exception of junk funds,generally offer yields that are about a percentage pointhigher than that.   Financial professionals encourage investors to be cautiousbefore jumping into any bond funds. &quot;You can do it a littleat a time. It doesn't have to be an all or nothing step,&quot;says Neal Litvack, marketing vice president at FidelityInvestments of Boston. For instance, he says, investors mightsplit the proceeds of a maturing certificate of depositbetween a money fund and a bond fund.   Others caution against simply going after the highestyield. &quot;There are ways to enhance yield,&quot; says Mr. Lamle,which can include reducing credit quality, extendingmaturities and buying securities that are subject to call --that is, bonds that may be redeemed before maturity, forcingfund managers to reinvest at prevailing lower interest rates.It's important to read the fund's prospectus and questionsales people about a fund's investments, the professionalssay.   &quot;People should be totally satisfied that they understandwhat they're getting into,&quot; Mr. Lamle says. &quot;They should doat least as much research when they buy a fund as whenthey're buying a new vacuum cleaner.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
