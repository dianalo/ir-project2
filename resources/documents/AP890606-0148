The House earlier voted 406-0 to approve a resolution condemningthe violence used against pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing andcommending the president for acting to end military cooperation withChina.   The Senate resolution also commends Bush and condemns ``thebrutal use of force by the government of the People's Republic ofChina against unarmed advocates of democracy and human rights inChina.''   But it also urges serious consideration of steps that go beyondthose taken so far by the president, including the consideration ofinternational sanctions.   These include:   _Calling on the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the Overseas PrivateInvestment Corp. to review financing of trade with China ``in lightof existing legal requirements for adequate human rights treatmentand the deteriorating condition of human rights in China.''   _Urging those U.S. agencies charged with liberalizing proceduresfor export licenses for sales to China to ``take into account thecurrent situation in China in making their decisions.''   _Urging the Voice of America to immediately increaseChinese-language programming.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and MinorityLeader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the administration supported theresolution.   Mitchell said that while the United States cannot control eventsin China, ``it is within our power to express the views of theAmerican people clearly, unequivocally and unambiguously ... intotal condemnation and denunciation of the actions that have beentaken.''   ``We have witnessed a great leap backward in China,'' said Dole.``I hope it is not too late for China's leaders to come to theirsenses.''   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said an increase in Voice of Americabroadcasts can be accomplished quickly and ``do a service for thepeople of China''   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said, ``This resolution is mildcompared to what the majority of us would like to see done to thoseresponsible for these atrocious acts.''</TEXT></DOC>
