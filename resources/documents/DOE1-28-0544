This paper discusses the initiatives at theFarley Nuclear Plant to reduce outage time and in particular a jointWestinghouse and Alabama Power effort to identify technological and operationalimprovements to shorten start-up and shutdown times. In summary, shorterrefueling outages mean a potential for increased availability as longas those activities required for high reliability are not sacrificed.In general, the improvements that result in shorter outages have alsobeen determined to provide benefits in radiation exposure, personnelsafety, and plant safety margin.</TEXT></DOC>
