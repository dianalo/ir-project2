(Unix Views) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Reider, Kurt.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) initiative, led by DECalong with several other vendors, drew considerable interest atthe 1991 DECUS symposium along with DEC's RISC/VMS portingprogram.andP;  DEC plans to offer a VMS product for RISC processors inthe near future, a combination that fails to address portabilityof RISC/VMS products to other RISC architectures.andP;  The ACEinitiative involves DEC making part of the Open SoftwareFoundation's OSF/1 operating kernel available to other vendors forintegration with their products.andP;  This does not mean that DEC isgiving up on Ultrix; it would actually allow a DEC Ultrix binaryversion to run on upcoming Open Desktop systems, greatlystrengthening future prospects for DEC's version of Unix.andP;  ACE isfocusing its development efforts on an Mips Computer Systems-basedarchitecture for future high-end microcomputers and low-endworkstations.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     UNIXUNIX-Like Operating SystemsTrendsFuture of ComputingConsortiaAdvanced Computing Environment.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Even though the Atlanta DECUS symposium has long since come and gone, I'veonly lately had time to mull over all I learned.andM;Right off the bat, I want to say this symposium went off a lot better than Ihad imagined, and a lot better than the previous symposium in Atlanta.andP;  Thecity as well as the convention facilities have improved and both contributedto a successful meeting overall.andM;Atlanta presented an opportunity to learn a lot.andP;  For one thing, I finallyarrived at the answer to something that has been bothering me for the pastnine years.andP;  How far do I walk at a DECUS symposium?andP;  With the aid of adigital (non-DEC) pedometer, I found out.andP;  I walked between four and sevenmiles a day, for a total of about 39 miles over the eight days I was inAtlanta.andP;  (And that doesn't include the Tuesday night romp to the Six Flagsamusement park.)andM;Seriously though, there was considerable interest in two things: DEC'sRISC/VMS program and the Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) initiative.andM;In this keynote speech, Bill Demmer, DEC's vice president of VAX/VMS systemsand services, talked about DEC's efforts to port the VAX architecture and VMSto a RISC chip.andP;  According to Demmer, DEC is projecting a RISC/VMS product inthe next two years.andP;  This combination should offer the performance ofRISC/Ultirx for those who need to remain firmly attached to the VMS world.andM;This combination does not address portability of RISC/VMS products to non0DECRISC architectures, but perhaps that will come in the future.andP;  Only Demmer,and maybe Charlie Matco, know for sure.andP;  What all this means to the owners ofVAX systems is still uncertain, but I would expect DEC to continue supportingVAX/VMS for some time to come.andP;  And I'd look for newer and faster VAXplatforms to be released.andM;The goal of the DECUS sessions on the ACE program was to readjust the focusof ACE from the initial press stories of DEC's abandoning Ultrix to one ofDEC's spreading the gospel of Ultrix to high-end PC and workstation users.andM;In case you hadn't heard, under the ACe initiative DEC is making its port ofthe OSF/1 kernel available to a consortium of systems and software vendorsfor porting to their platforms and integrating with tieir products.andM;Rather than DEC's giving up on Ultrix, what this all really means is that aDEC Ultrix binary version--for example, for DECwrite or DECpresent--would becapable of running on the Open Desktop systems from these other vendors, andthe software from these vendors would in turn be able to run on DECplatforms.andP;  People are referring to this development as the arrival ofshrink-wrapped software for the Unix community.andM;ACE also includes an agreement to focus development efforts on a Mips-basedarchitecture for the high-end PCs and low-end workstations of the future--theso-called advanced RISC computing (ARC) workstations.andM;The first ARC architecture workstations, the DECstation 5000 Model 120 andDECstation 5000 Model 125, made their debut in Atlanta.andP;  Although theseDECstations do not use the R4000 CPU from Mips (no system does at themoment), they are supposed to be upgradable to the R4000 when it does becomeavailable.andM;So, in the long run, the ACE initiative has things looking bright and rosyfor the Ultrix community.andP;  This is in marked contrast to the bleakabandonment of Ultrix that the trades were talking about a few months ago.andM;Since Atlanta, other interesting things have come up as well, and they offeryou, the reader, a chance to influence DEC's direction with Ultrix.andP;  As youare no doubt aware, a lot of VMS products are migrating to Ultrix.andM;If you would like to see EVE/TPU/LSE migrated as well, drop a note with asubject line of &quot;EVE/TPU on Ultrix&quot; to Gail Grant at grant@nsl.dec.com andlet her know.andP;  If you're interested in seeing Ultrix distribution andinstallation via CDROM only, drop a note with a subject line of&quot;CDROM--setups you would really crave&quot; to Jon &quot;Maddog&quot; Hall athall@wsl.dec.com.andM;Kurt Reisler is a principal software engineer with the Engineering andInformation Systems Division of Hadron in Fairfax, Va., which furnishescomputer communication and engineering expertise to commercial and governmentclients.andP;
