Showers and thunderstorms associated with what once was tropicalstorm Allison continued to produce locally heavy rain over easternTexas and the lower Mississippi Valley.   It was the third day of rain for Louisiana, bringing the totalrainfall to 20 inches at Winnfield and leaving homes and highwaysflooded throughout much of the state.   In Baton Rouge, Gov. Buddy Roemer declared a state of emergencyin six Louisiana parishes that sustained flooding and storm damagethis week. He said he sent 44 National Guard troops and 21 pieces ofequipment to the parishes.   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.47 inches of rain fellat Fort Polk, La., and 1.16 inches fell at Alexandria, La.   In Winnfield, Mayor Max Kelley said about 40 homes and businesseswere flooded and many streets were impassable. Flooding isn'tunusual in lowlying Louisiana, but he said Thursday's problems wereunprecedented.   ``We're having homes that never ever had water in them beforehave water in them now,'' Kelley said.   The flooding forced about 100 people to take refuge in the WinnParish courthouse and, 200 miles to the south a Thursday night stormthreatened to flood homes in the New Orleans suburbs on the northshore of Lake Ponchartrain.   St. Tammany Parish authorities reported street flooding inCovington after a Thursday night storm poured six inches of rain onthe area in 2{ hours and said evacuations might be necessary ifrivers and streams continued rising.   As it often does, Lake Pontchartrain kept the storm north of NewOrleans, which had no rain Thursday night.   At least three funnel clouds were sighted in southern Louisianain Evangeline Parish and near Lafayette, the National WeatherService said. But no damage was reported.   Several Louisiana rivers already were above flood stage andweren't expected to crest for one or two days.   Earlier in the week in Texas, Allison had dumped more than a footof rain around Houston.   On Thursday, the dwindling weather system had begun to retraceits path, slowly drifting westward, prompting reissuance of flashflood watches in southeastern Texas.   ``It's not near the storm when it went through a couple of daysago but it will produce some heavy rain,'' said weather servicemeteorologist Tom Fountain.   Allison had flooded hundreds of Texas homes, closed roads, andcontributed to at least four deaths. Preliminary damage estimateswere approaching $1 billion.   Numerous showers and thunderstorms also extended across thecentral Gulf Coast region and Florida. Fort Myers, Fla., got 1.18inches of rain in the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.   The roof of a recreation building on the Jones County JuniorCollege campus at Ellisville, Miss., partially collapsed during asevere storm Thursday, injuring four students enrolled in summerschool, school officials said. Three were treated on campus; one hadpossible head injuries.   ``Someone thought they saw a tornado and gave warning just beforethis happened,'' said Terrell Tisdale, the school's president.   Showers and thunderstorms developing ahead of a slowly movingcold front extended from northern Arkansas through northern Georgiaand eastern North Carolina. Early in the morning, a thunderstorm inextreme northeastern North Carolina spawned a waterspout which cameashore north of Buxton.   A cold front nearing the northern Pacific Coast produced showersin western Oregon and northwestern California.   Elsewhere, showers were widely scattered over the central Rockiesand showers and a few thunderstorms developed over the uppermississippi valley.   Overnight temperatures dropped to record lows around the GreatLakes, including 38 at Alpena, Mich.; 38 at Chicago; 43 at Madison,Wis.; 48 at Mansfield, Ohio; 35 at Marquette, Mich.; 46 at Muskegon,Mich.; and 37 at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.   In a balmier setting, Hollywood, Fla., hit a record low of 65degrees.   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57degrees at Klamath Falls, Ore., to 104 at Phoenix.
