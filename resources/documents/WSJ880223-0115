The insurer said it will offer the policy as a supplement to regular directors and officers insurance. As outside directors have been asked to take a greater and more-critical role in corporate operations, their legal exposure -- and their reluctance to serve as directors -- has increased, Aetna said.    The company noted that 35 states have placed some limits on outside-director liability, which allows Aetna to offer the policy.    The limit on the outside-director coverage is $10 million, with the premium varying by a company's size and the makeup of its board, a spokesman said.    Aetna expects revenue of $20 million from premiums on the new policy in the first year. Such supplementary policies haven't generally been available previously, Aetna added. </TEXT></DOC>
