Few energy-related inventions are successfully translated intoproducts and once on the market, many do not survive. Reasonable predictionsabout energy options in the year 2000 require a full understanding ofthe commercialization process as it pertains to new energy technologies.Drawing upon the experiences of the US Department of Energy's Energy-RelatedInventions Program (ERIP), this paper outlines some of the patterns,processes, and problems related to the commercialization of new energytechnologies. Energy price fluctuations, inadequate investment capital,insufficient market demand, and inappropriate commercialization strategiesare found to be common problems besetting ERIP inventors. 12 refs., 4figs.</TEXT></DOC>
