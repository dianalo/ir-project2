Draws Campbell's wrath  </CAPTION><DESCRIPT>  ALAMEDA; COUNTY; CHANGE; GOVERNMENT  </DESCRIPT><LEADPARA>  It's back to the drawing board for Alameda County's growing stack ofredistricting maps, and that produced bitter tension Tuesday among ethnicgroups and county supervisors themselves.;    At the urging of board PresidentMary King, supervisors postponed approving any map. Instead, they set a worksession for Thursday morning in a last-ditch attempt to come up with anagreeable plan.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  REDISTRICTING ON HOLD, AND TEMPERS ARE RISING  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     King said the board would return with a proposal by its regular meetingnext Tuesday. All told, supervisors have looked at 18 ways to split theirturf.;    The delay angered Supervisor Ed Campbell of Fremont, who latercharged that the only compromise King favored was one that gives her the mapshe wants.;    &quot;I don't think she had the votes there,&quot; Campbell said aftermore than two hours of debate punctuated by several hostile exchanges betweencommunity representatives.;    Tuesday's debate focused on two maps.;    One,called Map B, gives most of East Oakland to Supervisor Don Perata of Alamedawhile sending King's district into unincorporated Hayward and the city ofDublin. The other, Map R, also gives Dublin to King but hands her the morepolitically friendly East Oakland as well.;    Many black communityrepresentatives favor R, saying it unites flatland blacks with more-affluentblacks who live in Oakland's hills. But R has drawn harsh criticism from someAsians, who say it splits their population in Oakland.;    By law, the countymust redraw the supervisors' districts every decade to balance theirpopulations. The new map must be approved by November.;    Campbell, whofavored Map B, said the time for compromise is past.;    He vowed instead toresurrect a map that keeps Fremont, Newark and Union City together. Hedoubted, however, that such a plan had much chance for success because itwould put the entire Livermore Valley into King's district.;    &quot;They justthink they can hammer me down at will,&quot; Campbell said of his colleagues, whohe claimed had whittled away at his South County district to carve out thebest districts for themselves.;    He also attacked newly appointed SupervisorBill Aragon of Hayward for failing to make up his mind.;    &quot;Obviously thislittle fellow on the end isn't ready to make a decision,&quot; Campbell toldreporters after the meeting.;    &quot;Obviously he has a debt sitting out there&quot;for his appointment, said Campbell, who bitterly opposed the naming of theformer Hayward councilman to replace the late Supervisor Charles Santana.;   Aragon said during the meeting that he was leaning toward voting for Map Bbecause it kept most of the Hayward area intact. But he said he wasn't readyto vote on the matter.;    Aragon, who joined the board in June to findhimself in the middle of controversy over his past employment problems withAlameda County, said he didn't relish having the swing vote on the politicallycharged matter.;    &quot;Does it get any easier?&quot; he asked about his new job.;   Perata, who is wrestling with King for representation rights to East Oakland,agreed to Thursday's work session as long as the board holds another publichearing if it arrives at a dramatically new map.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ABBY COHN, Mercury News Oakland Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910731  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  526  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 31, 199100213174,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
