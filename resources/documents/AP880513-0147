(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state of the economy seems almosttoo good to be true less than seven months after the stock marketplunge, business leaders said Friday.   The Business Council, composed of 61 executives from the largestU.S. corporations, predicted modest growth, low unemployment andmoderate inflation this year in a report issued at its meeting atthe Homestead resort.   ``The economy and our businesses are doing quite well in spiteof that problem,'' said John F. Akers, chairman of InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., referring to the Oct. 19 stock marketcrash. ``Nobody is talking about that anymore.''   In fact, the economic forecast of the business group, whichrepresents the consensus of member corporations' chief economists,paints a more optimistic picture than the prediction issued justbefore the crash.   The business executives projected somewhat slower growth in theeconomy as measured by the gross national product _ 2.4 percentthis year compared with a forecast of 3 percent made when they lastmet in early October.   But they said both inflation and unemployment will be lower thanthey thought seven months ago and that growth will be more balancedthan the 3.8 percent expansion in 1987.   A buildup in inventories contributed almost one percentage pointto last year's growth. That is expected to moderate, with increasedexports and spending by businesses on new equipment filling in thegap.   Consumer spending, although growing at half of the 4 percentannual rate of the early 1980s, is expected to hold steady through1989, providing room in the economy for the production of exports.   ``I don't want to go on record saying (the crash) was a goodthing, but there were certainly good aspects to it,'' said John S.Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holdingcompany.   It relieved an unhealthy buildup of tensions in the financialmarkets and provided the world's central bankers an opportunity tolower interest rates, Reed said.   But underlying the optimism was a sense of unease among someexecutives that they attributed to two of the principal problemsblamed for causing the crash: the federal budget deficit and thetrade deficit.   ``Many of us continue to feel we must be living on borrowed timeto be having such good business conditions when the underlyingfundementals are so questionable,'' said Edmund T. Pratt Jr.,chairman of Pfizer Inc., a diversified health care company.   The stubbornly high trade deficit will drop from a record $171.2billion in 1987 to less than $150 billion this year, the executivessaid.   But they said that will not be enough to prevent a further slidein the dollar, which has already lost half its value in two yearswhen measured against the Japanese yen. The executives said thedollar, now trading at about 125 yen, will drop to 115 yen by theend of next year.   The budget deficit was predicted to remain ``disturbingly high''at $154 billion in 1988, up from $150.2 billion in 1987.   ``Clearly nothing will be done about it in an election year,''said Robert D. Kilpatrick, chairman of CIGNA Corp., an insurancecompany.   The executives' report also sounded a warning about risinginterest rates. Major banks this week raised their prime lendingrate from 8.5 percent to 9 percent.   Too much economic growth ``could produce an unavoidable rise ininterest rates and a recession before the end of 1989,'' it said.   However, Willard C. Butcher, chairman of the Chase ManhattanBank, said he was not overly concerned about the increase in theprime rate and said rates may fall back slightly by the end of theyear. ``I think we're overdoing fears of inflation,'' he said.   The Business Council saw consumer prices rising 3.9 percent in1988, down from the 4.4 percent rate in 1987. It said unemployment,which was 5.4 percent in April, would remain under 6 percentthrough 1989.   Opening their two-day meeting, the executives were briefed inprivate by Commerce Secretary C. William Verity and U.S. TradeRepresentative Clayton Yeutter. Other speakers on the scheduledincluded Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., the assistant RepublicanSenate leader, and Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., the rankingRepublican on the Senate Budget Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
