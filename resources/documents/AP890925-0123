Gunmen in a speeding car fired several shots at guardsprotecting the ambassador's residence in the pre-dawn hours Sunday,but no one was wounded, embassy spokesman Tom Leary said.   Police said it was unclear which of Peru's two guerrilla groups,the Mao-inspired Shining Path or the pro-Cuba Tupac AmaruRevolutionary Movement, was responsible for the attack.   The residence was unoccupied at the time. Former U.S. AmbassadorAlexander Watson left Peru several weeks ago for a new post. Hisreplacement, Anthony Quainton, has not taken up his new assignment.   Elsewhere, 10 hooded men burst into the home of EdilbertoSalazar, mayor of Morococha, an isolated mining town 66 miles eastof Lima, and shot him to death after locking his wife in a roomwith their four small children, police said.   At the same time late Saturday night, four other hooded menbroke into the home of Morococha's town treasurer, Hugo Ames, andkilled him.   Both men belonged to the United Left opposition coalition andwere running for re-election in November's nationwide municipalelections.   Government officials say the Shining Path, a dogmatic guerrillaorganization fighting since 1980, is trying to sabotage theelections.</TEXT></DOC>
