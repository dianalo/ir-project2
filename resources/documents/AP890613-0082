DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Commercialization of biomedical research inAmerican universities is threatening the integrity of scientificinstitutions, a congressional panel was told today.   Sheldon Krimsky, associate professor of urban and environmentalpolicy at Tufts University, testified before the human resourcessucommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations.   ``There have been changes in the social norms and values ofbiomedical scientists and their academic institutions,'' Krimskysaid. ``I believe some of these changes are detrimental to thegeneral well-being of basic science and to the public interest.''   ``Biomedical science has been intensely commercialized withinuniversities over a relatively short period of time,'' he said. ``Ihave heard it said within the scientific community that everyonegains from this marriage of academia and commerce. Nothing can befurther from the truth.   ``Not only are there losses, but some of these losses threatenthe integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken publicconfidence in science.''   He called for disclosure of financial interests related toresearch being conducted by scientists applying for grants.   David Noble, a professor of history at Drexel University and afounding member of the National Coalition for Universities in thePublic Interest, said universy researchers ``are free to makeundisclosed arrangements with private corporations in which theyoften have equally undisclosed personal roles.''   ``They are free to shape and profit from the public investment inresearch and many have done so,'' he said.   Noble said collaboration between universities and industries maybe useful but should be accompanied by ``proper disclosure andprocedural safeguards.''   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee, said, ``Iam sure that many Americans will be justifiably outraged by some ofthe ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold, ormanipulated for personal gain.''   Rep. Larkin Smith of Mississippi, the ranking Republican memberof the panel, said Congress should ``send a strong signal to theresearch community that scientific misconduct will not betolerated.''   At the same time, he said, ``A careful balance must be struckbetween avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientificbreakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions. We should notallow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the wayof overall progress.''</TEXT></DOC>
