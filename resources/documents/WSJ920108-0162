The settlement, announced to apacked Washington press conference on Jan. 8, 1982, paved theway for the break-up of the old Bell System, the corporatefamily of telephone companies headed by ATandamp;T that hadprovided telecommunications as a regulated monopoly for mostof this century.   It was the dissolution of a corporate empire with morethan a million employees and nearly $150 billion in assets,the end of a national institution most Americans thought ofas simply, &quot;the phone company.&quot; But the consent decree of1982 was much more than the end of an era; it was thebeginning of real competition in the U.S. telecommunicationsmarket.</LP><TEXT>   The decree recognized that local telephone service was amonopoly business and should be separated from thecompetitive or potentially competitive areas of the industrylike long distance service and the manufacturing and sale ofequipment. Since the old Bell System combined all thosebusinesses in one vertically integrated monopoly, it had tobe broken up. ATandamp;T divested its local telephone companies,which became the seven regional Bell operating companies, andturned its full attention to the competitive aspects of themarket.   This structural change brought new competitive energy to atelecommunications system that was already the benchmark forevery other country in the world. It sparked 10 years ofrecord investment, a decrease of better than 40% in longdistance rates, and it provided large and small customerswith a range of choices in suppliers, services and productsthat would have been barely imaginable 10 years ago.Telecommunications is one American industry that is strongertoday than ever before.   It is ironic, then, that a decade after the consent decreeagreement was reached, the American economy still has notfelt the full benefits of competition in thetelecommunications industry. Progress, yes, but the fullpotential has been held back by lingering regulatoryrestraints in the long distance industry.   Telecommunications is usually listed among the industriesthat were &quot;deregulated.&quot; In truth, the industry wasdismantled but only partially deregulated. Competitiverestraints placed on ATandamp;T's long distance business at thetime of the Bell System break-up are still in place. ATandamp;T issingled out for cumbersome tariff filings with the FCC beforewe are allowed to reduce prices or introduce new services.Each filing invites objections designed to delay the benefitswe're proposing.   In 1983, the last year before the breakup of the BellSystem, ATandamp;T filed 400 tariffs. Last year we had to file2,500. Does that sound like a deregulated industry?   Other long distance carriers were excused from thesetariff filing requirements. The tariff filing requirement wasapplied to ATandamp;T alone in the interest of protecting(fledgling) competitors in the long distance market. Todaythose competitors are multi-billion dollar corporations thatneed no protection from the rigors of the open market.   The logic of our own government limiting the strategicbenefits of full competition in long distance escapes mostpeople outside the Beltway, but there is an even greaterirony brewing in the market for telecommunications equipment.   The market for network telecommunications equipment inAmerica has become fully competitive in the years since theconsent decree. Today, hundreds of American manufacturers arecompeting with giant companies from Europe, Canada and Japanin a market that was once dominated by ATandamp;T and its captiveequipment supplier. Yet a lobbying effort is underway inCongress for legislation that would undo the spirit of theconsent decree by once again combining monopoly andcompetitive businesses.   The pending legislation would strip away the consentdecree's prohibition against regional Bell telephonecompanies manufacturing telecommunications equipment whilethey still hold a monopoly on local telephone service.   The regional Bell companies would argue that their entryinto manufacturing would stir competition and investment. Infact, it would be a return to the monopoly situation that theconsent decree and break-up of the Bell System were designedto eliminate.   Instead of having one vertically integrated monopoly witha captive supplier, as we had in the Bell System days, wecould have seven regional monopolies with seven captivesuppliers. The temptation to buy almost exclusively from thecaptive suppliers would push this industry back into thewasteful era of antitrust suits and regulatory chaos whenmarket decisions were made in the courtroom and the hearingroom and the cloakroom.   If, however, the monopoly in local telephone service wereeliminated and replaced with real competition, I'd say,&quot;everybody into the manufacturing pool.&quot; Let the Bellcompanies into the equipment business. But combining monopolyservice with a potential monopoly in equipment sales is aprescription for choking off competition and raising prices.   Telecommunications manufacturing remains a bright spot inthe American economy. In high-technology equipment, by farthe biggest segment of the industry, American manufacturershave a trade surplus that grew 400% to $862 million in 1991from $173 million in 1988. The vigor of this industry shouldnot be choked off.   The federal government can make a cost-free investment inAmerican productivity by removing the regulatory barriers inlong-distance and preserving the healthy competition thatalready exists in telecommunications equipment. Given theeconomic realities of intense foreign competition and saggingGNP, I don't think we can afford to do less.   ---   Mr. Allen is chairman and CEO of ATandamp;T.</TEXT></DOC>
