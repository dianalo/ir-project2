Leslie Durr, 21, was expelled from the University ofStellenbosch following a disciplinary hearing Thursday.   She was president of the Stellenbosch branch of theanti-apartheid National Union of South African Students, whichofficials banned from operating on the campus for four months.   A similar ban was imposed on a group representing theuniversity's black students.   At the nearby University of Cape Town on Friday, 22 studentswere arrested when they protested the ban on the groups, witnessessaid.   About 1,500 Stellenbosch students also staged a noon rally inprotest, but there were no arrests.   The banned student groups helped coordinate a protest two weeksago of the university's policy of housing non-white students in aseparate dormitory. About 100 students and teachers participated,and they were pelted with food by a few other students.   Stellenbosch, in a scenic wine-growing region near Cape Town,has about 13,300 white students and about 500 who are black, Asianor mixed-race. It is considered the best and the most liberal ofSouth Africa's five Afrikaans-language universities.   The University of Cape Town is one of the country's premierEnglish-speaking universities.   Stellenbosch officials banned student protests in 1985. Theschool's chief administrator, Rector Mike de Vries, said Friday thedisciplinary measures were taken because the ban was broken, notbecause of the protesters' views about segregated dormitories.   Ms. Durr, an honors student in philosophy, told reporters thatuniversity authorities were using her as a scapegoat.</TEXT></DOC>
