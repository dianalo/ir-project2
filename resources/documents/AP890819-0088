Without a list of specific products to work from, the U.S.Customs Service has been largely ineffective in enforcing the importban passed by Congress in 1986, the General Accounting Office said.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who requested the GAO study,said it pointed to a ``shocking lapse by top Reagan administrationofficials, who failed to apply elementary enforcement procedures incarrying out the anti-apartheid law.''   The legislation, which was approved over former President RonaldReagan's veto, banned imports of a variety of goods from SouthAfrica, including products of so-called parastatals _ entities ownedor controlled by the South African government.   ``The State Department issued a list of South African governmentagencies and state-owned corporations that it designated asparastatals but did not identify the products produced, marketed orexported by them,'' the GAO said.   ``Because products associated with parastatals have not beenidentified, Customs cannot use trade data, which is kept on aproduct-by-product basis, to obtain leads on illegal imports fromparastatals,'' it added.   While direct U.S. imports of South African gold ceased in 1987,the bullion could still be entering the United States illegally bytransshipment through Britain and Switzerland, which market much ofSouth Africa's gold, according to the GAO.   Between January 1987 and March 1989 British exports of gold tothe United States totaled $175 million and Swiss gold exports tothis country came to $164 million, the watchdogs said.   ``Because it was not widely known in Customs that gold was underthe parastatal sanction, it could not use data on trade flows toobtain leads on illegal trade and could not identify possibletransshipment of South African gold to the United States throughthird countries,'' the report said.   As the result of its inquiry, GAO officials said the Customsagency is now investigating whether some gold from Switzerland andthe United Kingdom is of South African origin and is entering theUnited States illegally.</TEXT></DOC>
