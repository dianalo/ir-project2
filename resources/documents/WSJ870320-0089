But the panel put off until next week consideration of more controversial proposals that would require retaliation against certain unfair trade practices by foreign countries and limit presidential discretion in resolving trade disputes.    And Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said he was considering waiting until the legislation moves to the House floor before fighting for his highly charged amendment to force trade retaliation against countries that have huge trade surpluses with the U.S.    The committee worked all day yesterday behind closed doors on a bill offered by its chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.). Rep. Rostenkowski's proposal, which was approved by a Ways and Means subcommittee last week, is viewed as less protectionist than the legislation introduced earlier this year.    One provision approved by the committee yesterday would increase retraining benefits for workers whose jobs are lost because of imports. It also would set up a voucher system for payment of these benefits.    The committee toughened provisions for dealing with foreign companies that repeatedly &quot;dump&quot; goods -- or sell them at unfairly low prices -- in the U.S. It provided for expedited action on dumping complaints against foreign companies and took steps to make it easier for U.S. companies to bring civil suits against foreign manufacturers. The panel voted to drop a proposal to establish criminal penalties for dumping violations, however.    The panel also voted to give the Commerce Department new powers to prevent firms from circumventing anti-dumping orders by shipping their products in parts or through a third country.    The committee voted to transfer the authority to determine whether an industry is entitled to protection from imports to the U.S. trade representative from the president. Some lawmakers believe that the trade representative would be more inclined than the president to rule that an industry is being hurt by imports. Such an injury finding can trigger the imposition of tariffs or quotas on the imports.    Under the panel's bill, an import-battered industry would be required to devise a plan to return to competitiveness before it could receive such import relief. But even dying industries could qualify. The Reagan administration has argued that an industry should be required to demonstrate that it can survive before it can receive such protection.    Rep. Gephardt, a presidential candidate, told reporters yesterday that he was determined to push for his amendment, which is designed to force such countries as Japan to reduce their large trade surpluses with the U.S. Rep. Rostenkowski's proposed bill significantly watered down the proposal. It simply would require the administration to negotiate with the other country, rather than forcing the president to retaliate immediately.    &quot;My concern with that approach is that it doesn't give a standard of accountability,&quot; Rep. Gephardt said. &quot;I still think I can pass this amendment on the House floor.&quot;    Meanwhile, a House banking subcommittee approved legislation forbidding foreign firms from becoming primary dealers in U.S. government securities unless their governments give U.S. companies the same right in their countries. </TEXT></DOC>
