Becareful. You could get whiplash, money managers warn.   &quot;Right now, you have to be more selective than ever&quot; withbiotech companies and &quot;focus on those with earnings,&quot; saysJohn Kaweske, manager of Financial Strategic Health SciencesPortfolio of Denver.</LP><TEXT>   Inspired by the 340% rise in Amgen Inc.'s stock in thepast year, investors have rushed into biotechnology stocks insearch of the next rising star in the young industry. As theDow Jones Industrial Average broke through 3000, medical andbiotechnology stocks peaked with a nearly 60% gain for theyear before easing back to a 54% rise as of Friday.   Now the savvy money is getting cautious. Seeking toprotect his fund's stunning five-year record of 50.8% annualgains, Mr. Kaweske now holds just a handful of profitablebiotech companies such as Amgen and Chiron Corp., and a fewthat are launching new products and should soon becomeprofitable, such as Centocor Inc. and Genzyme Corp. &quot;Therewill only be three or four companies that will duplicateAmgen&quot; among the scores now publicly traded, Mr. Kaweskesays.   To hedge his biotech investments, he also is investing insome less expensive stocks of more mundane, non-biotechcompanies that are devoted to keeping down health-care costs.His picks include two newly public companies, CommunityHealth Systems, a hospital operator, and CareNetwork Inc., ahealth maintenance organization.   Amgen's success has been &quot;extremely unique&quot; among youngcompanies developing genetically engineered cures for rareand life-threatening diseases, cautions biotechnology analystLinda Miller of PaineWebber Inc. It's unlikely, she says,that many companies will be able to duplicate the unusualcircumstances that made a superstock out of Amgen.   Although most new drugs are accepted only slowly by themedical community, Amgen's Epogen passed its lengthy testswith flying colors and was quickly deployed to treat chronicanemia in kidney dialysis and cancer patients, Ms. Millernotes. In unusually short order, insurers agreed to reimbursepatients for the drug, which defied expectation and becamebiotechnology's biggest success with 1990 world-wide sales of$600 million. Another new product, infection-fightingNeupogen, was recently approved for marketing. Analysts havedoubled their earnings expectations for Amgen since June.   Unlike many biotech shares that today are soaring on loftyexpectations, Amgen stock was long depressed by investors'worries about the company's patent battle with GeneticsInstitute Inc. Amgen soared 12 points the day it won anunexpectedly sweeping victory in the dispute. It laterclimbed to a high of 136, compared with a split-adjusted52-week low of 30 7/8, and riveted attention on the biotechindustry. Amgen ended at 134 Friday.   &quot;The Amgen coattails were very long for the sector,&quot; saysMs. Miller. &quot;Those stocks that just rode the coattails willhave a very tough time hanging on.&quot;   Plenty of investors seem to agree. Short sellers, whoborrow high-priced stocks to sell and hope to profit bybuying them back after sharp declines, have swarmed aroundbiotech issues. As of mid-March, the short interest in nearly90 medical and agricultural biotech stocks tracked byPaineWebber Inc. had soared to a record 19.7 million shares,up 156% from the level of April 1987, the year of the stockmarket crash.   For the novice investor who wants to climb onto thebiotech bandwagon now, Ms. Miller has blunt advice: &quot;Forgetabout it. You have to have good, fundamental knowledge of theindustry or you're asking for trouble.&quot;   More seasoned investors should diversify their portfolio,she says. At these high prices, however, Amgen is her only&quot;buy&quot; recommendation. She finds just three stocks&quot;attractive:&quot; Centocor, which recently won approval in Europefor its septic-shock drug and should break even or becomeprofitable this year; Genzyme, which she expects to earn 75cents a share this year and $1.25 a share in 1992 from salesof a recently approved treatment for Gaucher's disease; andImmunoGen, a Cambridge, Mass., company still in the testingphase of several cancer treatments.   Meanwhile astute investors are paring their biotechinvestments in favor of cheaper health-care stocks. Mr.Kaweske has cut his biotech holdings to 14% of his totalportfolio from 22% nine months earlier. He is hanging on tohighflying Amgen, with expectations that the company'searnings will grow 40% to 50% annually for the next couple ofyears. Synergen Inc., a leader in developing products totreat brain diseases, is one of his long-term holdings. It'stoo early to tell, he adds, if other competitors in the fieldwill succeed.   Biotech investors should beware of companies in the firstof the three stages of drug testing required by regulators,Mr. Kaweske warns. &quot;The process is designed to weed outproducts.&quot; The probability that a young company will achievecommercial success is about 20% to 25% at the first phase ofclinical studies, he estimates. The chance of success risesto about 40% or 50% at the second phase, 70% at the end ofPhase III trials and 85% by the time a company files anapplication for marketing approval.   Certain big drug companies with smaller biotech partnersare attractive to Cheryl Alexander, manager of the $530million Putnam Health Sciences Trust of Boston, who now hasonly 6% of her fund in biotech stocks. She's been buying theshares of Johnson andamp; Johnson and Baxter International Inc.,traded on the New York Stock Exchange, expecting theirearnings to grow about 15% to 18% a year with the help oftheir ventures with smaller biotech companies. Johnson andamp;Johnson markets Amgen's Epogen and has a joint venture withChiron; Baxter has a licensing agreement with GeneticsInstitute.   Among biotech issues, Ms. Alexander also is focusing onwhat she calls &quot;the first wave&quot; of companies, those that wentpublic early in the decade and are nearing profitability.Recently she has been nibbling at the &quot;unloved&quot; shares ofGenetics Institute, which has plunged to less than half its52-week high of 62 1/2 after losing the patent battle withAmgen and amid concerns that its white-blood cell stimulantmay be inferior to Amgen's.   Genentech Inc., traded on the Big Board, is anotherout-of-favor issue that appeals to her. She likes thecompany's pipeline of products in development, and theprospects that it will some day reach a co-marketingagreement with majority-owner Roche Holdings Inc. Among the&quot;second wave&quot; of young companies, those that should earnprofits in two or three years, Ms. Alexander bought Synergenand Xoma at lower levels but calls them too high now.   She's steering clear of the &quot;third wave&quot; -- companies suchas newly public Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that aren'texpected to be profitable before the end of the decade.Regeneron's popular initial offering was a peak in the&quot;feeding frenzy&quot; in biotech stocks, she adds. Regeneron wentpublic at $22 a share April 2, and by Friday it was down to14 3/8.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks fell, but U.S. HealthCare andPacifiCare Health Systems soared amid robust profitexpectations for both health maintenance organizations.   The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 1.39 to 494.64, a 0.3%loss. For the week, smaller stocks fell less than largerissues as the Nasdaq Composite eased 1.3%, the New York StockExchange Composite Index dropped 1.4% and the Dow JonesIndustrial Average shed nearly 1.8%.   OTC volume eased to 149.2 million shares from 169.6million Thursday. Declining issues continued to leadadvancers, 990 to 864, but 112 issues climbed to new highsand only 16 fell to new lows.   U.S. HealthCare soared 5 3/4 to 50 after the Blue Bell,Pa., company reported that first-quarter net income soared to69 cents a share from 25 cents a share a year earlier.PacifiCare Health Systems soared 5 1/2 to 32 1/2 after theCypress, Calif., company said that it expects to report netincome for the second quarter ended March 31 of about 50cents to 60 cents a share, up from 33 cents a share a yearearlier.   HMO America fell 1/2 to 15 3/4. The Chicago healthmaintenance organization reported that first-quarter netincome rose to 33 cents a share from 23 cents a share a yearearlier, but the profit was about two cents a share lowerthan some analysts had expected.   Two newly public issues fared well. Xyplex, a maker ofdata communications network systems, closed at 15 3/4 onnearly 2.3 million shares after an offering of two millionshares at $14 apiece. Ross Systems, a provider of businessapplications software, closed at 10 3/4 and was the day'smost active OTC stock with 3.1 million shares changing hands.Ross offered 2,750,000 shares at $10 each.   Provident Life andamp; Accident Insurance Class B shares fell 11/4 to 20 1/2.

Mail Boxes Etc. slid 1 1/4 to 21 3/4 after dropping 3/4Thursday. Alex. Brown andamp; Sons analyst Christopher E. Vroomtold Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that Mail Boxes'profit for the fiscal fourth quarter ending this month may besomewhat below his estimate of 22 cents a share. Mr. Vroomsaid the company's electronic tax filing services weren't aswell received as he had expected. For the full year, however,he expects the company to earn 80 cents a share, comparedwith a split-adjusted 63 cents a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
