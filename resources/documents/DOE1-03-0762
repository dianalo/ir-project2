Analysis of the isochore maps suggests that 70 to 80% ofthe sediment deposited within the basin during the Cretaceous Periodwas accompanied by subsidence of the continental margin; the remaining20 to 30% was accompanied by subsidence of the Mississippi Salt Basin.As the continental margin reached isostatic equilibrium during the Tertiary,less sediment was deposited and thus was accompanied by less regionalsubsidence. Maximum depositional rates occurred during periods of deltabuilding, and minimum rates occurred during periods of shallow marinedeposition. Structure-contour and isochore maps were also constructedfor a 1400-mi{sup 2} (3500-km{sup 2}) area in the vicinity of RichtonDome to illustrate the effects of local salt withdrawal on the sedimentationpatterns. 75 refs., 53 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
