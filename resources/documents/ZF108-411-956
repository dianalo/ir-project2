 Pressed by demands to distribute computing powe, decreasemaintenance and support costs, and cope with continual organizationalupheaval, MIS managers must confront an array of tough choices.andM;They can stick with a traditional three-tier setup of mainframe, midrange andpersonal computers or terminals.andP;  Or they may decide to eliminate themainframe and distribute compute power over multiple midrange machines.andP;  Andsome are considering doing away with the midrange, relying on mainframes andthe joint power of PC LANs.andP;  Whatever the strategy, the solutions they choosemust carry their companies into the future.andM;As a result, MIS managers find themselves evaluating systems according toshifting criteria.andP;  Today, managers are looking for systems that match theirorganizational structure, philosophy and long-range strategic plans.andP;  Theyare taking a broader view of costs, factoring in maintenance, programmertraining and software development and availability.andP;  Sheer price/performanceand the existing computing culture are often lesser concerns.andM;The two predominant contenders in the midrange arena are Digital EquipmentCorp.'s VAX/VMS line and IBM's AS/400 series.andP;  The reasons behind a company'schoice are often results of a complex intertwining of the organization'scomputing history, its present demands and its vision of the future.andM;Each system has strengths and weaknesses.andP;  The DEC line is well known forsoftware compatibility, consistency and connectivity.andP;  VAX/VMS offers asingle architecture, from the smallest Micro VAX to the mainframesized VAX9000.andP;  Software can be moved unchanged from one machine to another.andP;  About7,000 applications are available for VMS, many of them vertically oriented.andO;And the DECwindows interface helps make VMS relatively easy to use.andM;IBM's AS/400, with its OS/400 operating system, is far more powerful than itsmidrange predecessor, the System/3X line.andP;  The AS/400 offers morefunctionality because its system hardware and software are fully integrated,according to Doreen Simeone, director of information services at ADM Inc., anAS/400 consulting firm in Cheshire, Conn.andP;  &quot;For example, the AS/400 has anintegrated relational database, and packages for it take advantage of that,&quot;Simeone said.andP;  Embedded training modules make the AS/400 easier to learn, sheadded.andM;More than 5,000 software packages are available for the AS/400, Simeone said.andO;Most are for such commercial applications as general ledger, payroll andaccounts receivable.andP;  Far fewer are available for niche applications.andM;In addition to software availability, MIS managers are concerned with howeach platform stacks up as an application development environment.andP;  Most VAXapplications are written in Cobol; most AS/400 applications are written inRPG.andM;As an environment for application development, DEC offers VAXset, a set of3GL and 4GL VMS-specific Case tools.andP;  To allow for easier development ofapplications that will interactively share data, DEC is working on adding aDECwindows interface to its Case tools, according to Phil Auberg, manager ofVMS marketing.andP;  In the next few years, Auberg said, DEC will also migratemuch of the code for its Rdb relational database into VMS.andM;The AS/400's integrated features serve it well for development purposes,proponents says.andP;  &quot;The AS/400, with its program development manager andbuilt-in database, is a highly productive machine for developingapplications,&quot; said Jim Franch, director of technology at Chicago-basedSystem Software Associates, Inc., makers of the BPCS series.andP;  &quot;It allows usto write an integrated set of applications for the total enterprise.&quot;andM;Currently, few 4GLs and application generators are available for the AS/400,but this is changing, Simeone said.andP;  &quot;Case tools and development tools arenow starting to fill the gap.&quot;andM;IBM's recent announcement of AD/Cycle, the Systems Application Architecture(SAA) framework for application development, brings the AS/400 into theapplications development mainstream, said Jim Smith, director of businessdevelopment at Synon, Inc., a Larkspur, Calif.-based maker of Case tools forthe AS/400.andM;THE COMPATIBILITY ISSUEandM;The AS/400 also represents the first implementation of SAA, IBM's longrangestrategy for providing software compatibility across its product line.andP;  ManyIBM users consider SAA-compliance important.andM;&quot;With DEC, you're able to to subdivide mainframe applications to get down tothe personal level.andP;  With IBM, you'd have to buy new software because all thesoftware is incompatible,&quot; said Dennis Vohs, chairman of Ross Systems, a PaloAlto, Calif., vendor of financial applications for the DEC VAX.andP;  &quot;IBMrecognizes this.andP;  The whole SAA process is aimed at getting there.&quot;andM;Compatibility between different systems has yet to be accomplished.andP;  S/38applications written in RPG run almmot as fast on the AS/400; however, S/36applications cannot make optimum use of the AS/400's speed or features.andO;Converting to native mode can be time-consuming and difficult.andM;The compatibility issue alone can push users into a midrange choice.andP;  SanAntonio, Texas-based insurer Unied Services Automobile Association (USAA)recently upgraded from a System/38 to an AS/400 Model 50.andM;&quot;We were running a multiple-line insurance and accounting application fromMcCracken [Computer, Inc.] on the S/38.andP;  Then McCracken decided to quitsupporting the S/38 software.andP;  They already had a package for the S/36, so wedecided to migrate to the S/36 environment on the AS/400,&quot; explained MarshallHighsmith, manager of multisystems technical support at USAA.andP;  (McCrackenComputer, Inc. is based in Burlington, Mass.)andM;&quot;We were forced to go to McCracken's Insight product, which runs in the S/36environment,&quot; added Hugh Woodchick, a senior systems programmer at USAA.andO;&quot;It's pretty similar in functionality, but in my opinion it's a stepbackward.andP;  Programs running in the S/36 environment are not as efficient onthe AS/400 as in their native environment.andP;  McCracken is striving to getapplications written natively, but that will take time.&quot;andM;&quot;We didn't have any love for the S/38,&quot; Highsmith said.andP;  &quot;It didn't make anydifference what our platform was as long as it was reliable and efficient inmeeting our users' requirements.&quot;andP;  However, USAA is mainly an IBM shop withfive 3090 mainframes, one of the largest IBM users in Texas, Highsmithpointed out.andP;  &quot;We didn't consider going outside IBM since our applicationswere already IBM-based.&quot;andM;CONNECTIVITY CONCERNSandM;Connectivity was the principal criterion for Paul Goyette, technicalconsultant with the California State Assembly Office of Information Servicesin Sacramento.andP;  A few years ago, Goyette's organization evaluated systemsthat would provide the state legislature with word processing and electronicmail.andP;  The organization decided to go outside IBM to the VAX.andP;  A former15-year DEC employee, Goyette was familiar with the platform's advantages.andM;&quot;One of the main requirements here that drove the VAX decision--which tookplace before the AS/400 was avaialble--was the number of applications we haddeveloped under the IBM mainframe.andP;  We needed continued access andinteroperability to our massive databases,&quot; Goyette said.andM;Today, MicroVAX IIs are installed in all 80 assembly members' districtoffices.andP;  A pair of DEC 8550s, which perform support and developmentactivities, form the central cluster.andP;  Altogether, Goyette and a 50-membersupport staff service over 100 remote sites plus 100 offices in the capital,all networked together.andM;&quot;Nobody else at the time came close to meeting our requirements to interactwith the host mainframe in a user-friendly manner,&quot; Goyette said.andP;  &quot;DEC didIBM better than IBM did.&quot;andM;At Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. in Akron, Ohio, the decision to go with the VAXwas made jointly among the plants' development staff and MIS, based on theVAX's top-to-bottom compatibility and communications, said Graham Reinke,manager of the North American Tire Information Systems Division.andP;  The companycontinues to use IBM for systems that rely on central databases, such asmanufacturing resource planning.andM;VAXs are used in the tire manufacturing plants, which migrated from IBM 43XXmachines.andP;  A few VAXs are also used for development, especially by theengineering and automation control groups.andP;  &quot;VAXset [application developmenttools] is very good in the development area, which enhances productivity,&quot;Reinke said.andM;The VAX 6310s used in the manufacturing plants perform several types ofapplications, including systems that count products, record material testingand test finished products.andP;  &quot;We're also working on a lower level of our MRPII system for scheduling purposes,&quot; Reinke said.andM;Nevertheless, the AS/400 may be in the company's future because ofFirestone's acquisition by Bridgestone.andP;  When the VAXs were chosen a fewyears ago, the AS/400 was not yet available, although the S/38 wasconsidered.andP;  &quot;Bridgestone is more inclined to the AS/400.andP;  It's certainly agood machine,&quot; Reinke said.andM;&quot;Eventually we'll have to face the question of, 'Do we standardize on the VAXor the AS/400, or support both?'&quot; he said.andP;  Some of Bridgestone/Firemstone'sdiversified plants--those producing textiles, synthetic polymers and rubberroofing, for example, have S/38 machines and are alrady upgrading to theAS/400.andP;  &quot;The AS/400 has powerful packages available for it, but we tend toregard it as more suited to smaller, less specialized businesses,&quot; Reinkesaid.andM;The AS/400 is more than just an upgrade machine for S/36 and /38 users,according to Jim Franch of SSA.andP;  &quot;A lot of mainframe and PCM users aredownsizing now,&quot; he said.andP;  Many of these decisions are driven byorganizational realignments.andM;That was the case at Premark International, Inc., in Deerfield, Ill.andP;  &quot;We hada system for a $ 10 billion business, but we're a $2.5 billion business now,&quot;said Jim Sullivan, director of information systems.andP;  Premark, formerly thenonfood companies of Dart and Kraft, Inc., is now an independent entity.andP;  Itsbusinesses include Tupperware and West Bend appliances.andM;&quot;We went from an IBM mainframe to one minicomputer in the corporate office torun mainframe applications such as accounting, taxes and financialconsolidations,&quot; Sullivan said.andP;  Moving down decreased costs by 25 percent,he said.andM;Premark chose the AS/400 Model 60, even though Sullivan felt that much moresoftware was available for the VAX.andP;  A reduced staff tipped the scales to theAS/400.andP;  &quot;We evaluated DEC, but we don't have as many technical people now,and we needed simplicity,&quot; he said.andM;Ryder Truck Rental, Inc. of Miami, Fla., also chose the AS/400.andP;  DennisKlinger, vice president of MIS, believes that an organization's computersystems should parallel the structure of the organization itself.andP;  Rydercomprises many autonomous organizations, including truck leasing and contractcarrier businesses for commercial and consumer leasing and rental.andP;  The setupmandates a distributed computer network, Klinger said.andM;Ryder was an AS/400 beta site and received its first production models latein 1988, when it began installing them in its 100 remote profit centers.andO;Each profit center is a $20 million to $50 million business supported by anAS/400 tied to both dumb and intelligent terminals.andM;&quot;We have a traditional three-tier architecture of 3090 mainframe, AS/400s andPCs.andP;  We support everything from rental integration to accounting, billingand payroll operations to inventory and vehicle maintenance, withcommunications up to and down from the mainframe,&quot; Klinger said.andM;Ryder predominantly uses AS/400 Models 35 and 45, with upgraded versions ofthe 30 and 40.andP;  Models 50 and 60 are also in use, and the company plans toadd a couple of the new 10s and 20s.andP;  &quot;The size of the system is determinedby the size of the profit center,&quot; Klinger said.andM;Ryder chose AS/400 based on the company's past history as an S/36 user.andP;  &quot;Wemade a decision to go with the S/36 and what we believed the S/36 would turninto,&quot; Klinger explained.andP;  &quot;S/36 code runs on the AS/400, but it doesn't runwell enough to take advantage of the system.andP;  We need native mode, and we'rejust about there now.&quot;andM;The AS/400 is functionally much richer than the S/36 environment, said DianeDeLaurier, senior project manager at Ryder.andP;  &quot;The AS/400 is light years aheadof the S/36.andP;  Programmers like the interactive debug capability, the helpfacility and the ease of setting up communications,&quot; she said.andM;Training programmers on the AS/400 has been a hurdle, however.andP;  &quot;For the S/36folks, there's been a fairly significant learning curve,&quot; DeLaurier said.andO;Another difficulty was the difference in programming languages.andP;  &quot;We were aheavy Cobol shop, and the AS/400 and Cobol are not natural partners,&quot; shesaid.andP;  &quot;But RPG and the AS/400 are wonderful together.&quot;andM;Ryder considered other midrange alternatives, Klinger said, but an IBMarchitecture had long been in place, and converting to another vendor'smachines would have been too expensive.andP;  &quot;We didn't start with a clean pieceof paper, but 20 years of heritage,&quot; he explained.andM;Klinger did experiment with a VAX for inventory and recordkeepingapplications.andP;  &quot;We put in a couple of small applications, and we were verypleased, but we sould have had to train people on languages, approaches andsoftware to continue with it.andP;  It was technically feasible but not practicalto bring DEC in.&quot;andM;At The Associated Group in Indianapolis, decentralization led to the oppositechoice: the VAX.andP;  Decentralization was essential for the company to becomemore customer responsive, said Julie Beckner, manager of financial systems.andO;The Associated Group does business as Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Indiana.andP;  Itis also spinning off 20 subsidiary companies providing an array of financialservices to specific markets, such as banks, local government, and collegesand universities.andP;  This diversification drove the shift in computing styles.andM;&quot;The entire company was IBM-based for 20 years,&quot; said Beckner.andP;  &quot;We were anIBM shop with huge 3090s.andP;  But our need to decentralize lends itself to oneof the VAX's strengths: the ability to string several together and add onwhen we need more power and storage, rather than upgrade and go throughconversion.&quot;andM;Reducing support staff was another consideration.andP;  &quot;A tremendous operationalstaff is required to run the IBM setup.andP;  With DEC, applications programmerscan almost run the system themselves,&quot; Beckner said.andP;  &quot;It's much friendlier,so development is easier.&quot;andM;The Associated Group is just beginning to roll out its VAXs, which vary insize.andP;  The VAXs will run Ross Systems' financial software, including generalledger, accounts payable and receivable, and payroll.andM;When the company made its evaluation a few years ago, the AS/400 was verynew, but Beckner said that it is unlikely the company would have consideredit as an alternative solution.andP;  &quot;We didn't switch because we werediscontented with IBM,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;The strategic direction of the companychanged to one of smaller companies operating more efficiently.&quot;andM;The effects of organizational changes drive many midrange systemsevaluations.andP;  Many layers of corporate management have disappeared in recentyears, and information systems reflect this change.andM;&quot;The hierarchical system with the monster behind a glass wall and lots of PCsand terminals doesn't work any more,&quot; said DEC's Auberg.andP;  In the computingmodel of the future, applications will be distributed across nodes in anetwork, while departmental machines will share the compute load and parts ofthe database, he predicted.andP;  As computing moves toward a client/serverapproach, a trend both DEC and IBM recognize, Auberg said application designwill change radically as well.andM;Farsighted organizations are already implementing such radical changes.andP;  Twoand a half years ago, Georgia-Pacific Corp., Atlanta, embarked on a newtechnical strategy, said Paul Pavloff, senior director of informationresources.andP;  &quot;We decided to move from a traditional high-cost 370 mainframedata center environment to a peer-to-peer networking environment based onwhat we call application-dedicated computing.andM;&quot;We believe mainframes used in a multiprogramming mode were the order of theday 20 years ago, but technology has changed since then,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Now theCPU is the cheapest part of the configuration.andP;  Rather than deal with bigoperating costs and a complex environment, we decided to position ourselvesover the next decade with a simpler, more effective way of computing thatwill allow us to maintain service and response levels with fewer supportpeople.andP;  We had S/36s and S/38s, and we decided to go with what became theAS/400.&quot;andM;Georgia-Pacific maintains two systems for its different needs: The pulp andpaper side is committed to DEC and some IBM 9370s, and the materials andcorporate headquarters side uses AS/400s.andP;  All plants are linked toheadquarters.andM;The company has 21 AS/400s networked by a Token - Ring LAN, running a widerange of applications.andP;  About 160 IBM-compatible PCs are connected to theAS/400s.andP;  There are also 10 S/36s and two S/38s, which do not connectdirectly to the Token-Ring.andP;  Three 8500 and 6200 model VAXs are tied to about120 VAX 3100 terminals on an Ethernet.andM;&quot;The company is growing rapidly through acquisition, so we end up with ahodgepodge of systems,&quot; Pavloff said.andP;  &quot;There's been no attempt to say weshould use one or another.andP;  Where communications are necessary, we try toprovide bridges.&quot;andM;&quot;We sized the equipment based on the needs of the application,&quot; Pavloffcontinued.andP;  &quot;With the AS/400s, that meant that each machine would primarilyhouse an application or family of applications that share the same databaseor are located in the same department structure.&quot;andM;The choice of the AS/400 was not a foregone conclusion.andP;  &quot;From a strategystandpoint, DEC had a form of peer-to-peer networking, but unfortunately thatlooked to us like a data center environment,&quot; Pavloff said.andP;  &quot;We visualizethe kind qf computing that fits the company and the culture.andP;  Data centersdon't fly well in decentralized companies.&quot;andM;Eventually, Georgia Pacific plans to move even further from today'speer-to-peer setup to a client/server approach.andP;  Users will have access toany CPU and any office environment based on need.andP;  Pavloff's goal, like thatvoiced by many of his peers, is the bottom line of any evaluation: &quot;We wantto move to the low-cost computing solution of the future.&quot;andM;Francett is a freelance writer based in Bloomfield, N.J.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
