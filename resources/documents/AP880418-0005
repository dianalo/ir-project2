Provocations for protests have run the gamut from an assault atthe University of Massachusetts to verbal harassment at DenisonCollege in Ohio to a stolen bicycle in Berkeley.   ``In every single one of these instances, there has been somelocal incident or an accumulation of things ... the straw thatbroke the camel's back as it were,'' said Mary Frances Berry, amember of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and Sigal professorof history at the University of Pennsylvania.   ``But if one looks generally, one sees that on these campusesyou have the basic sort of reaction against the expansion ofopportunity for blacks,'' she said.   Although black college enrollment has increased by about 25,000between 1976 and 1986, according to the U.S. Department ofEducation, the proportion of blacks has declined from 9.6 percentto 8.8 percent of the national student body, largely because of adecline in the number of black male students.   Whites accounted for 79 percent of the students in 1986, downfrom 82 percent in 1976.   Charles Willie, professor of education and urban affairs atHarvard University, said the protests are based on a sense ofdespair about the Reagan administration's commitment to securingequal opportunities.   ``When there is a belief that there are others who are acting onone's own behalf, there is a tendency for minorities to accommodateshortcomings and faults and abuses _ minor abuses _ on the basisthat help is on its way,'' Willie said in a telephone interview.   ``The sense of abandonment leads to a sense of despair, and thenthere is a tendency to strike out at all kinds of harm, instead ofaccommodating. Where there is a sense of despair, the level oftoleration is certainly reduced.''   Last week, Denison University banished two white students fromits Granville, Ohio, campus for the remainder of the academic yearfor harassing a black student.   The students had been found guilty of harassing Aaron Laramore,a black senior, by pounding on the wall of his dormitory room andyelling racial epithets.   In other recent incidents:   _ In Durham, N.C., about 300 people staged a protest Friday atDuke University, saying there were not enough black faculty membersand calling the prestigious school a ``racist institution.'' JosephDi Bona, an associate professor in the education department, saidthe shortage of black faculty members means that blacks at Dukelead ``disembodied lives.''   _ About 100 students marched to City Hall in Lexington, Ky., onApril 8 to protest a racial epithet used by A.B.``Happy Chandler,''the former governor and baseball commissioner who is now a memberof the University of Kentucky's Board of Trustees. During adiscussion about investments in South Africa, Chandler had remarkedthat Zimbabwe, formerly ruled by whites, is ``all nigger now.''   _ Eighteen black students at Berkeley were cited for trespassingApril 7 following an all-day sit-in at the campus housing office byabout 50 members of the African Students Association. The protestwas spurred by one freshman's complaint that three white studentsdamaged her bicycle and that she had been the object of slurs andjokes.   ``This protest is the culmination of a lot of different thingsthat have gone unresolved at the university,'' said ASA PresidentMichael Stoll.   _ Black students and feminists protested at the University ofPennsylvania after an all-white fraternity staged a pornographicshow featuring two black strippers. On March 4, the universityordered the Zeta Beta Tau house closed for at least 1{ years.   _ In February, minority students took over a building at theUniversity of Massachusetts campus in Amherst after two blackstudents were beaten by five whites. Two of the whites dropped outof school before disciplinary hearings were held, and two otherswere put on disciplinary probation.   _ Forty black, Hispanic and other minority students occupied adormiitory office at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., for ninedays endng March 2. The students won a 16-point agreement whichincluded the appointment of a dean of multicultural affairs and anadviser for the student group which occupied the dorm office.   _ Minority students at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.,organized several rallies and a boycott of downtown stores thatadvertise in The Dartmouth Review after the conservative,off-campus weekly renewed its attacks on the competence of WilliamCole, a black professor of music.   A college disciplinary board last month suspended three Reviewstaffers and put a fourth on probation after they confronted Colein his classroom. In a March 28 speech, Dartmouth President JamesFreedman said the Review is ``poisoning the intellectualenvironment of our campus.''   _ Black students organized at Georgia Southwestern College toseek the dismissal of a professor who allegedly called a student a``black bitch.''   The professor said the student had accused him of being a racistwhen he refused to let her withdraw with a passing grade instead ofa failing grade.   ``We've got to do a lot more to sensitize majority populationsabout the needs of minority students,'' said Tom Goodale, vicechancellor for student affairs at University of Denver andpresident of the National Association of Student PersonnelAdministrators.   Goodale said one underlying issue in recent protests is accessto higher education. Though the latest federal budget provides forincreased aid, ``the rules are more cumbersome,'' he said in atelephone interview.   ``The other issue is continuing racism, whether that is in theform of language or violence. The country, for whatever reason, isin a conservative mood. Racial slurs, the predominant problem ofpoverty, have brought those issues to the forefront again.''</TEXT></DOC>
