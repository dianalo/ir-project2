They are called burakumin.   To the outsider, Japan looks remarkably homogeneous. Thearchipelago's 123 million people share language, physicalappearance and customs. Legally, all are equal.   But for the burakumin, the invisible minority, the homogeneityof this society is a tantalizing myth.   They are descended from people who were designated as hereditaryoutcasts in the 17th century and were officially liberated by theMeiji government in 1871, just eight years after Lincoln'sEmancipation Proclamation freed the slaves in the United States.   More than a century later, most burakumin still live in and taketheir name from the ``buraku,'' hamlets or neighborhoods where theoutcasts were settled.   They still face discrimination in employment, marriage andvirtually all aspects of their treatment by Japanese lucky enoughto be born elsewhere, said Sue Sumii, 88, who has spent 70 yearsfighting discrimination against the burakumin.   A translation of ``The River with No Bridge,'' the first novelin the author's six-volume series, was issued by Charles E. TuttleCo. this spring in Japan, the United States, Britain and Australia.It was first published in Japanese 31 years ago.   The book opens in 1908, and Ms. Sumii says the sentimentsrevealed in it have hardly changed.   ``There are about five families living in a buraku at the edgeof this town, and no one lets their kids go play there,'' she saidin an interview.   ``Those families weren't welcome in the neighborhoodassociation. People living in the buraku were left out of thepostwar land reform, so many are still tenant farmers. Thingshaven't changed much at all.''   According to government statistics, 1.17 million burakumin livein 4,603 buraku areas. The Buraku Liberation League, the largestadvocacy group, says there are about 3 million living in 6,000buraku neighborhoods and many others try to hide their background.   Ms. Sumii grew up in western Japan, where many buraku live. Shesaid she learned from childhood friends how it felt to live on thewrong side of the ``bridgeless'' river dividing burakumin fromother Japanese.   Her story's hero is a bright 8-year-old named Koji who wonderswhy all the people in his village are called ``eta,'' a now-tabooword that means ``great filth.''   Koji wonders why the people are poor, although they work hard,and why other Japanese say they stink.   ``How did we get to be `eta'?'' he asks. ``We aren't `eta'because we want to be. We don't even know what it means.''   Japan's worship of its imperial family is at the root ofdiscrimination, Ms. Sumii said. Many historians say they don't knowhow some people came to be outcasts, but Ms. Sumii believes thecustom originated in the 7th century, when the land came underimperial control.   ``When they distributed the land, it went only to `law-abidingcitizens','' she said. ```Bad citizens' were people opposed to theemperor.''   In the 17th century, the Tokugawa shogunate divided society intofour castes. At the top were the samurai, or warriors, followed byfarmers, artisans and merchants. Outside the caste system were twogroups: the Eta and the Hinin (non-humans).   Birth as an ``outcaste'' has traditionally evoked littlesympathy. Buddhists believed it was a sign of retribution forwrongs committed in a past life, Ms. Sumii said.   Because they were physically identical to other Japanese, inmany places the burakumin were forced to wear inferior clothes orshoes.   They were forced into communities on marginal land, where mostmodern buraku still live. Buraku areas often were left blank on oldmaps.   Burakumin were relegated to jobs linked with death, such asbutchering, leather tanning, shoemaking, gravedigging andcremation. Those activities were considered impure by Buddhism,which condemns the killing of any creature, and by Japan'sindigenous Shinto religion, which shuns contact with the dead.   When the Meiji government ``liberated'' the burakumin in 1871,it also began a system of family registers that include backgroundand birthplaces.   Family registers can be used to identify people from the buraku,and private companies have been found to use illegally publishedlists of buraku communities to discriminate in hiring.   Families often hire detectives to investigate the familybackgrounds of marriage prospects. Discovery that a person is froma buraku can lead to a broken engagement or divorce.   ``Even today, the situation has not basically changed,''Etsuhiro Honbe, a buraku resident, wrote in the Buraku LiberationNews. ``Although there are fewer cases of blatant discrimination,it has changed into something more cunning, spread like a trapready to catch you.''   In December, a court ordered the brother and sister-in-law of aman married to a woman from a buraku to pay the woman 7 million yen(about $47,000) for ``destroying'' the marriage after theydiscovered the wife's background.   Taboos about burakumin are so ingrained that the subject rarelyenters polite conversation. Only in August 1989 did a ose who do not havea proven track record in theindustry.''</TEXT></DOC>
