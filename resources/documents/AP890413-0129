Before the tug, flying blue flags of the United Nations, leftthis suburb south of Khartoum, Miss Hepburn was briefed on themechanics of Operation Lifeline Sudan, a massive relief effortaiming to prevent 100,000 or more starvation deaths this summer.   The U.N.-organized project, which began April 1 but has donelittle so far because of logistical problems, is to prestock morethan 170,000 tons of supplies in southern Sudan before rains inmid-May make most of the region's roads impassable.   Aid experts doubt the $132 million program's chances for successbecause of the difficulties of transporting food amid Sudan's6-year-old civil war.   The brief departure ceremony was Miss Hepburn's first officialact in Sudan as ambassador of the U.N. children's fund, a post shetook last year to succeed the late actor Danny Kaye.

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An attorney for the rock band Judas Priest isseeking dismissal of a lawsuit that claims the British group'sheavy metal music led two youths into a suicide pact.   Suellen Fulstone of Reno said in a motion filed Wednesday thatthe band could be held liable in the case only if the courtscreated a dangerous exception to First Amendment rights forsubliminal messages.   ``The implications of any such exception are altogetherfrigid,'' she said. ``The very fact of this lawsuit has had animproperly inhibiting effect on creative work. It should be thelast of its kind.''   Ms. Fulstone argued in the Washoe District Court motion thatwords that are heard subconsciously should have the sameconstitutional protection as any other printed or spoken words.   A lawsuit against Judas Priest and CBS Records claims that thewords and subliminal messages on the band's ``Stained Class'' albummotivated James Vance and Raymond Belknap of Sparks to attemptsuicide in 1985. Belknap shot himself to death, but when Vancefired, the shotgun slipped and ripped his face apart. He died inNovember.</TEXT><DATELINE>SOUTH HOLLAND, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Adrian Cronauer, the military discjockey who inspired the film ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' bellowed``Good Morning, Chicago!'' to a crowd of nearly 500 during asuburban college appearance.   He then had lunch with a group of veterans.   ``The best thing that happens is when a veteran says to me,`Thanks for helping me get through Nam,''' said Cronauer, who wason the air from Saigon in 1965-66, entertaining the troops withmusic and irreverent humor.   Cronauer's speech Wednesday at South Suburban College in SouthHolland was peppered with anecdotes about his radio show and hisdealings with Hollywood, but he concluded on a more somber note.   ``Vietnam veterans often greet each other by saying `Welcomehome,' because no one else ever said that to us,'' he said.   Later, at lunch, a vet in a black ``POW-MIA'' T-shirt approachedCronauer, shook his hand and said quietly, ``Welcome home.''</TEXT><DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It's been a good year for Max vonSydow, who starred in an Oscar-winning picture, directed his firstfilm and now has been paid a $50,000 tax settlement that ends a16-year dispute.   The national news agency TT said Thursday the government paidvon Sydow the money in compensation and court costs as a result ofhis challenge of a fine for allegedly underpaying his 1973 tax bill.   Because he could find no mechanism to appeal in Sweden, vonSydow had paid the fine and left the country in a huff. He tookSweden to the European Court of Human Rights, saying the lack of anappeal mechanism infringed on his rights. The case was settled outof court in 1987.   Von Sydow, 59, was nominated for best actor in ``Pelle theConqueror,'' which won the Oscar for best foreign film last month.``Along the Roadside,'' the Danish-language film he directed, hasalso won acclaim.</TEXT><DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II andher husband, Prince Philip, will make a state visit to Malaysia inOctober and the queen will open the Commonwealth summit in KualaLumpur on Oct. 18, Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar said Thursday.</TEXT></DOC>
