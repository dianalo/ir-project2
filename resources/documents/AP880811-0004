Here, 10 minutes away you can find lots of good restaurants.You're drilling in civilization.''   Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, a state-owned oil company,started sinking the exploratory well at Ivry, on the southern edgeof Paris, Tuesday. It is the first of several such wells plannedunder the Paris-Ile de France permit, which covers Paris and itsnorthern, eastern and southern suburbs.   The permit was awarded in December 1985 to Elf, Total CompagnieFrancaises des Petroles, and British Petroleum after competitionreached a pinnacle in the search for oil in the Paris Basin, 50,000square miles stretching east from Paris to the West German border.   For years there have been rumblings that the City of Lightitself might be sitting on crude, a theory that provoked smiles,cute headlines and gags about industrializing the Eiffel Tower.   Oil companies are less fanciful. The Elf-Total-BP associationalready has spent $11.6 million on its permit, most of it forseismic tests, according to the chief of Elf's French operations,Bruno Weymuller.   The Paris Basin contains 40 million tons of known oil reserves,48 operating wells and about 600 exploratory wells.   With a discovery rate of 1 in 12 wells, compared to the 1 in 20average, the Basin is increasingly drawing foreign oil companies,although oil executives concede it will never be Houston.   But ``no one dared go into this area before,'' Louis Prudhomme,Elf's assistant director of French operations, said of the region.   About 10 million people live in the 587 square miles covered bythe permit, and Elf is making a special effort to be discreet, atleast as discreet as one can be with a 165-foot oil derrickoperating round-the-clock.   Motors powering the drill are kept in sheds beside the derrick.A wall to cut noise was erected to help shield residents of anapartment block across the street. A special phone line wasinstalled to receive complaints.   ``We've tried to protect the environment to a maximum,'' saidPrudhomme.   Ivry, on the left bank of the Seine, is one of several sitesconsidered promising on the basis of seismic tests.   The objective of the Ivry drilling is in fact about a half-milefrom the derrick, on the right bank of the Seine. That means thebit grinding its way 2,000 yards into the earth must follow adeviated course, complicating drilling, officials said.   By Wednesday morning, a hole 2,067 foot deep had been bored, thedrilling superviser said.   The operation is to be completed in about three weeks. Apositive find would mean boring ``appreciation'' wells nearby todetermine the size of the oil deposit, according to Elf officials.   Total has said it plans to start drilling before the end of theyear.   Limited seismic tests of the capital, made two years ago,revealed that the center of Paris was ``not a geologicalpriority,'' Elf officials said.   ``Is there oil under Paris? We will only know when we'vedrilled. That is the moment of truth.'' Prudhomme said. ``We'vealready staked out forage sites if one day we have to work inParis.''   A derrick could be erected at a stadium or in an unused trainstation or abandoned apartment buildings, according to officialswho do not rule out rigging a derrick on a boat on the Seine.   No one in France stands to get rich overnight by owning land ona drilling site. The property owner receives a modest ``rent'' fromthe oil company, but the state controls mineral rights.   Parisians, easily moved to protest, remain placid in the face ofthe Ivry drilling.   ``If they put a gas pump on my route and lower the price, that'sall I care about,'' said Jean-Louis Ribolla, a waiter near theChamps Elysees.   ``Finding oil in the Place de la Concorde would be quiterefined,'' he added, winking.</TEXT></DOC>
