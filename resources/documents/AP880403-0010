WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pope John Paul II celebrated Easter SundayMass in St. Peter's Basilica, then appealed for world peace andoffered Easter greetings in 52 languages to thousands of worshipersin rain-drenched St. Peter's Square.   Among the thousands of people who packed Christendom's biggestchurch for the Mass was U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz,who was to leave later in the day for Israel on a new Middle Eastpeace mission.   The Mass, usually held on the flower-decked travertine steps ofSt. Peter's, was moved inside the church because of rain. But thepope later spoke from the church's central balcony as more than100,000 people stood in the square below.   In his traditional Easter message ``Urbi and Orbi'' (to the cityof Rome and the world) following the Mass, the pope asked theVirgin Mary to pray for peace, justice, human rights and religiousfreedom.   Departing from his written text and speaking emotionally in astrong, hoarse voice, the pontiff said, ``Pray for peace in theworld, for justice, pray for the rights of man, especially forreligious freedom, for every man, for every Christian andnon-Christian, pray for us.''   ``Pray for the solidarity of all peoples of the world, the firstworld, second, third and fourth, all the world,'' he said. ``Inyours and our Easter joy, we carry again this weight of humanity,this weight of so many human hearts, our brothers, our sisters, andwe repeat: pray for us.''   In a private audience on Saturday, Shultz had received thepope's blessing for his voyage.   Shultz's wife, Helena, a Roman Catholic, was one of those takingCommunion from the pope.   Winter weather descended on Rome this weekend, with a cold,steady rain drenching the capital Sunday morning.   It was decided at the last moment to move the service inside thebasilica, where the pope celebrated Mass from an altar under the``Baldacchino,'' the immense Baroque canopy designed by Bernini.   The Italian news agency ANSA estimated that 150,000 Romans,pilgrims and tourists _ most of them huddling under umbrellas _stood outside in the square and its side streets and listened tothe service broadcast on loud speakers by Radio Vatican.   The crowd broke into loud cheers and chants of ``Viva il Papa''(long live the pope) when John Paul, keeping with tradition,appeared on the central balcony at noon to deliver his Eastermessage and blessing.   The message was directed to the Virgin Mary, for whom the popehas a special devotion and dedicated the current Marian Year.   ``Christ whom you bore is risen, Alleluia,'' said the pope,wearing a white robe trimmed in gold and a tall, gold miter, orbishop's hat. ``Queen of heaven, rejoice. This is the day of thechurch's Easter joy. We all share in your glory, oh mother.''   ``Behold the whole church today tooks to you, oh Mary. Eventhough we do not see you among the people about whom the accountsof Easter tell, we all look to you ...   ``During this year, which has been dedicated in a particular wayto you, during this Marian Year, be present in a special way in thechurch..''   Then, following his improvised plea for world peace, thepolyglot pope wished the world a happy Easter in 52 languages. Thelongest greeting was in his native Polish.</TEXT></DOC>
