Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, who ordered hisexaminers a year ago to begin paying closer attention to LBOlending, said ``criticized highly leveraged transactions'' at the11 biggest banks under his jurisdiction jumped from 9 percent atthe end of last year to 17 percent at midyear.   This raises concern that as competiton among banks to make theseloans heats up, some may make riskier loans, he said in a speechthis week. ``When the marketplace is as crowded as it appears ...(it) almost always leads to abuses.''   Moreover, smaller regional banks with less experience in thefield are increasing their involvement, he said, adding, ``We areconcerned that banks without proper understanding of thetransactions or appropriate risk management procedures areparticipating in leveraged financing.''   The 29 banks now targeted for quarterly monitoring of their LBOportfolios all have at least 2 percent of assets tied up inleveraged deals. At the 11 largest the average was 4 percent.   The 11 large banks are: Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and MarineMidland, New York; Bank of America and Wells Fargo, San Francisco;First National Bank of Boston; Continental Illinois and FirstChicago, Chicago; NCNB, Charlotte, N.C.; Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh,and Security Pacific, Los Angeles.   Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for the comptroller's office, declinedto release the names of the 18 regional banks. ``We don't want tocreate undue concern.'' She emphasized Friday that being on thelist does not signify a bank is in any danger.   In a leveraged buyout, investors _ often managers seeking tothwart a hostile takeover _ borrow heavily against a company'sassets in order to buy it. Critics say the debt can be risky if thecompany's profits slip.   An increase in banks' caution about such deals, particularly aproposal last month for a buyout of United Airlines' parentcompany, was cited by traders as the trigger for the Oct. 13 stockmarket plunge.</TEXT></DOC>
