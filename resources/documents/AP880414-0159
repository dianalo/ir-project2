I don't think the American people are ready for areverend to be in the White House, and I think it's a pretty goodidea one never is.''   Falwell's comments came as part of a panel discussion ontelevangelists on the second day of a three-day convention of theAmerican Society of Newspaper Editors.   An estimated 685 editors attending the convention also heardfrom Jackson and his fellow Democratic presidential hopeful, AlbertGore, as well as from House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and CostaRican President Oscar Arias, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize forhis efforts to end fighting in Central America.   Falwell said he was pleased that television representatives inthe National Religious Broadcasters had agreed to recommend thatall Christian stations drop Swaggart's religious program if hereturns to preaching before his one-year suspension expires.   ``That doesn't mean all the stations have to comply with thatrequirement,'' Falwell said. ``But my guess is that most of themwill.''   Falwell, along with panelists Jeffrey K. Hadden, sociologyprofessor at the University of Virginia, and Tulsa (Okla.) Tribunereporter Mary Hargrove, told the editors that the sex scandals thatbrought down Swaggart and Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker marked the endof an era for televangelists.   ``We're witnessing a serious readjustment of the work ofreligious politics,'' Hadden said.   ``The questions about financial accountability already had beenraised. The sex scandals were the final icing on the cake,''Hargrove said.   Falwell said he believes ``it was inevitable that thesecatastrophies occurred'' and said it was not the press that broughtdown the Bakkers and Swaggart. ``They brought themselves down.''   ``Frankly,'' he said, ``an inevitable housecleaning was overdue.Yes, it's hurt everybody ... but the major hurt is the terribledamage done to the value systems and the principle systems of youngpeople in this country.''   Falwell, who took over the debt-ridden PTL ministry after theBakkers' departure and resigned from it late last year, said onegood thing had come out of the Bakker-Swaggart sex scandals: theend of televangelists' celebrity status.   ``There will never again, and I thank God it's true, be a personthat people look to as God. Celebrity status is history.''   Earlier in the day, the editors heard a plea from Wright tocover all the details of a comprehensive trade bill now beforeCongress. He called the measure one of the most important now onCapitol Hill.   ``You hold the keys to developing thoughtful commentary onevents,'' Wright said.</TEXT></DOC>
