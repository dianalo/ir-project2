Expects To Report Profit Rise For Fiscal 4th Period </HL><SO> </SO><CO> PAYX </CO><IN> CEO </IN><DATELINE> ROCHESTER, N.Y.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Paychex Inc. expects to report a 16% gain in net income for the fourth quarter ended May 31, the company said.    A year earlier, Paychex, which provides automated payroll accounting to small businesses, had net of $1.4 million, or 16 cents a share.    Revenue increased about 26% from the year-earlier $17 million, said B. Thomas Golisano, chairman and chief executive officer.    For fiscal 1988, Paychex expects to report about a 35% gain in net. In fiscal 1987, net was $5.1 million, or 40 cents a share, adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split paid in November 1987. Revenue for fiscal 1988 was about 24% greater than the year-earlier $63.9 million.    In fiscal 1988, the company installed $2 million in new laser printer equipment, incorporated a payroll specialist training school and added a telemarketing division, which reduced profit margins about 20% on a per-share basis, Mr. Golisano said. At the same time, Paychex increased its client base to 87,000 clients, compared with 70,200 last year.    In spite of the steady increase in Paychex's client base, Mr. Golisano said in an interview, it has tapped less than 3% of the market in the 60 cities it serves. That market -- employers with between one and 100 workers -- continues to expand because of an increasing number of start-up companies.    Mr. Golisano expects Paychex's customer base to increase in fiscal 1989, boosting revenue more than 25% and profit about 35%. It expects to open about six new offices in fiscal 1989.    He said Paychex's capital budget will be between $6.5 million and $7 million, slightly lower than last year's $7.5 million, when the company installed a large number of laser printers. Next year, it will concentrate on upgrading its computer and telephone equipment. Paychex is also building a new warehouse and distribution center in Rochester. Mr. Golisano said Paychex will be able to finance its operations and upgrades with its internal cash flow.    Mr. Golisano said he has &quot;a higher level of confidence today than we did a year ago,&quot; regarding the company's foray into the fringe benefit market. Paychex had approached small companies with a plan that would allow them to form groups for health insurance and disability benefits. Paychex processes the administrative paper work normally done by the insurance carrier, thus allowing for better rates. In the past year, he said, the company has improved its fringe benefit business by refining its product offering, sales and data processing techniques.    Paychex will offer the fringe benefit service in two or three additional cities in fiscal 1989, bringing the total to about 11 cities. He said he doesn't expect these operations will have any positive or negative impact on earnings for the next two to three years because proceeds will be used to expand into new markets.    &quot;Our main emphasis is in the payroll processing business. The fringe will be far more important at a later date,&quot; he said.    Paychex has no current interest in expanding its payroll processing services to larger employers. Even though there is less revenue and greater turnover with smaller employers, he said, there is also less competition in that market and less sophistication required. </TEXT></DOC>
