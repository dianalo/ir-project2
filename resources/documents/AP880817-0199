Regulations require that horses be given a day off when thetemperature reaches 90 degrees. Humidity is not a factor, althoughit should be, City Council Majority Leader Peter Vallone said.   A furor erupted after Whitey, a 9-year-old gelding, collapsedSunday en route from Central Park to his stable blocks away. He hassince recovered, although the ASPCA has ordered him to stop workingfor 30 days.   On Wednesday, Vallone and Councilman Robert Dryfoos held a newsconference along Central Park South, where the carriagescongregate, to decry the horses' working conditions.   ``It is time for city officials and the public to reach out andtake extra steps to protect these animals, not only for humanereasons, but because they are an important symbol to the flavor andcharm of this city,'' said Vallone.   ``I think today is the beginning of fantastic negotiations,''said Grace Randall, a nurse who saw Whitey collapse and helped savehim.   But carriage drivers, noting that race tracks allow horses torun even when it's 100 degrees, said they feel like scapegoats.   ``I had a woman come up to me yesterday and tell me I'd die in arotten hell,'' said Eva Haws, driver of 6-year-old Bubba. ``I'vehad people throw things at me, spit on me, push me.Well-intentioned ignorance is the most dangerous kind.''   ``Would I work in a business where there is outrageous cruelty?I'm a vegetarian; I belong to Greenpeace and the antivivisectionmovement,'' said Ms. Haws, adding that Bubba gets to stop workingwhen it's 89 degrees and humid.   ``I watch the horse's reactions at all times. It doesn't have tobe 90 degrees _ I know when the horse is in stress,'' said thedriver of 10-year-old Katie, who wouldn't give his name.   Drivers said long, hot spell has caused them financial hardship.   ``Business is pretty bad. We've lost a lot of income,'' saidGeorge Corler, driver of 9-year-old Fred. ``A lot of people liveoff this.''   Katie's driver said his business had dropped 60 percent becauseof the heat spell. ``I just suffer it out, that's all,'' he said.``If the law says 90 degrees, then that's it.''   Vallone and Dryfoos urged the public to complain to police anddrivers if they see carriage horses being worked in the extremeheat.   They also called for horse shelters and watering stations nearCentral Park.   One city official and a veterinarian are assigned to enforce thecarriage horse ordinances, but they don't work weekends.``Primarily, the task is left to eight ASPCA agents, who arealready overburdened in enforcing all animal rights laws throughoutthe city,'' said Vallone.   Dryfoos said he is drafting a new ordinance, to be introducednext fall, covering such issues as weather, rest and wateringperiods.</TEXT></DOC>
