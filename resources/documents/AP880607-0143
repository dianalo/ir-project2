NHTSA lowered the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE,standard automakers must meet in 1986 from the 27.5 mpg set byCongress to 26 mpg, asserting the higher standard was noteconomically practical.   The state of California, the cities of Los Angeles and New Yorkand four citizens groups, led by Washington-based Public Citizen,filed petitions requesting a court review of the order.   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,in an opinion by Judge Ruth Ginsburg, said NHTSA's ``considerationof the likelihood of economic hardship within its assessment of`economic practicability' must be given due weight.''   The agency's decision was based on analysis that concluded thehigher standard would have severe economic effects throughout theauto industry, and therefore was not arbitrary or capricious as thepetitioners had charged, the court said.   The petitioners also asserted that NHTSA, by lowering thestandard, had failed to consider the nation's need to conserveenergy. The CAFE standards were initially adopted in the 1970s toreduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.   The court, however, said the agency had weighed increased fuelconsumption against economic harm under broad guidelines set byCongress.   ``Had Congress offered a more precise balancing formula for theagency to apply, ... we could more confidently discern the agency'scompliance with the congressional mandate,'' the court said.   In the absence of such precision, the court said it must concludeNHTSA had properly accomodated conflicting policies in lowering thestandard.   Mrs. Ginsbug was joined in the majority by Judge Abner Mikva.Judge Lawrence Silberman dissented.   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley has called for repeal of theCAFE standards, saying in an era of cheaper energy they haveoutlived their usefulness and harm the U.S. auto industry'scompetitiveness.   Supporters of the standards argue they must be retained to keepthe nation from again slipping into deep dependence on unreliableforeign sources of oil.   Besides NHTSA, the petitions named Ford Motor Co., the AutomobileImporters of America Inc. and General Motors Corp. as defendants.</TEXT></DOC>
