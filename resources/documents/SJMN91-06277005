But she called his actions &quot;verytawdry.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LUNGREN CAMPAIGNS FOR DEATH PENALTY FUNDS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Brian Lungren, the attorney general's brother and political consultant,said Dan Lungren was following the lead of other California officials,including George Deukmejian when he was governor, in setting up a privatelyfunded political organization to mobilize citizen support for particularpolicies.;   &quot;It's an effective way to complement the governmental side ofDan's office,&quot; his brother said. &quot;As attorney general, Dan Lungren takespositions on key issues and in some cases turns on the political heat aswell.&quot;;   He said Dan Lungren, who took office last January, testified beforeCongress on the death penalty issue as part of his job and was seeking moneyonly to pay costs of a citizen petition campaign. The letter does not drawthat distinction clearly, however.;   The new campaign was disclosed this weekby the Los Angeles Daily Journal.;   The &quot;Dear Friend&quot; letter bemoans&quot;endless&quot; federal appeals of death sentences in California. Without mentioningnames, it refers to the case of Robert Alton Harris, whose death sentence inthe 1978 slayings of two San Diego teen-agers has been under review in thefederal courts for most of the last decade.;   Lungren calls for support of abill sponsored by President Bush that would eliminate federal appeals of statecriminal convictions if constitutional claims have been fully reviewed instate courts.;   &quot;Moving up repeatedly to the federal courts is nothing morethan a stalling tactic and a huge financial waste of taxpayers' money,&quot; theletter states.;   The &quot;bleeding-heart liberals&quot; such as the ACLU will turn outin force &quot;on behalf of convicted murderers&quot; to oppose the bill and will bewell-funded, Lungren writes.;   He adds that he is &quot;ready, willing and able totake YOUR MESSAGE to Congress and do everything in my power to see thiscampaign to a winning conclusion. But I can't do it without your moral andfinancial help.&quot;;   The letter appeals for contributions to Lungren's 1994re-election committee and for signatures on a petition to Congress supportingBush's proposal. The petitions declare signers to be members of Lungren's Lawand Order Committee.;   Brian Lungren said 60,000 to 70,000 letters had beensent out so far and 7,500 signatures have been collected. He said the moneywould be used solely to pay for the petitions and not for general campaignpurposes.;   The letter includes a fine-print notation that it was not printedat government expense. Ehrlich, executive director of the ACLU of NorthernCalifornia, agreed that Lungren was violating no laws but questioned thepropriety of his campaign.;   &quot;It's very tawdry for the attorney general touse the official seal of California, to use that stationery, to use theauthority of his office for a fund-raising campaign,&quot; she said, especiallywhen the message is that the centuries-old right of federal appeal was &quot;alegal technicality that should be done away with.&quot;;   Ehrlich also said thatLungren failed to mention that one of his responsibilities as attorney generalis to represent the state by giving testimony to Congress.;   &quot;It isabsolutely fraudulent to suggest to a donor that this (money) will enable him(Lungren) to present that viewpoint to members of Congress,&quot; she said.;  Brian Lungren said the ACLU was hypocritically trying to shift the focus fromthe death penalty to the attorney general's campaign.;   &quot;They're shaking intheir boots right now that Attorney General Lungren will lead the Californiaand American people in restoring the deterrent effect of the death penalty,&quot;he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911003  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  645  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 3, 199100277005,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
