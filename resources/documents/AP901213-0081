They said five or six vehicles were also destroyed in the airraid on the camps located near Kokkilai village, 155 milesnortheast of Colombo, near the port town of Trincomalee.   ``At least 40 rebels are believed to have been killed in theoperation which lasted over four hours,'' said the officials whocannot be identified under briefing rules.   The report could not be independently confirmed, and there wasno immediate response from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,which has been fighting for an independent nation in the northernand eastern regions since 1983.   Officials said the air attack was launched following reportsfrom military intelligence.   This is the second major air offensive against Tiger rebelssince they overran an important military camp last month in thenorthern region of Mankulam, killing at least 100 soldiers.   The loss of Mankulam was one of the worst setbacks suffered bythe government since the rebels broke a 13-month ceasefire lastJune.   Fifteen guerrillas were killed in November when governmentplanes destroyed a convoy of Tamil Tiger trucks in Jaffnapeninsula, the island's northern-most area and a rebel stronghold.   Deputy Defence Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said today that troopskilled two rebels hiding in the Karaitivu refugee camp in theeastern Batticaloa district. He said two others swallowed cyanidepills when they were captured.   ``These terrorists on the run now hide inside refugee camps ofinnocent Tamils and attack forces,'' said Wijeratne. ``But we havebeen tipped off and are taking appropriate action.''   The government routinely describes Tamil militants asterrorists.   Wijeratne said 18 suspected rebels were arrested from theKaraitivu camp.   More than 14,000 people have been killed in the 7-year-oldseparatist campaign.   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the island's 16 millionpeople, complain they are discriminated against by the majoritySinhalese in jobs, education and language. Sinhalese, who make up75 percent of the population, control the government and military.</TEXT></DOC>
