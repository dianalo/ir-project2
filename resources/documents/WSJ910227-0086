There is, however,one possible impediment to the workings of this hugefree-trade area: The individual countries have theirindividual currencies and their individual financialpolicies, a situation that at times may make it seem thatEurope's nations are racing around in different directions.   At the moment, for instance, Germany is deeply concernedabout the inflation it fears will be triggered by the reunionof East and West. So the Deutsche Bundesbank is raisinginterest rates. At the same time, Britain and several otherEuropean countries are worried most about recession and thuswant to cut interest rates.</LP><TEXT>   Worry about the dangers of conflicting policies has led alot of Europeans to speculate on the possibility of a commoncurrency. A candidate is available: the ecu, or Europeancurrency unit. It doesn't exist in a physical sense, but itserves as a reserve asset for the participating countries. Ifthere is to be a single European currency, of course, therewould have to be a single European monetary policy.   Proposals for achieving that sort of setup are varied. Onepossibility often mentioned is to merge the existing centralbanks. This solution has a bureaucratic attraction, sincehardly any central bankers would lose jobs.   Each of the existing central banks would become a regionalbank, much like the Dallas or St. Louis banks in the FederalReserve System. Existing Federal Reserve currency carries thename of the regional bank that issues it, and in a similarway there could be German, French and British ecus. The ecusissued in a particular country could even carry a picture ofa national hero.   The practicality of this may be, to some minds, somewhatquestionable, but the subject surely makes for livelydiscussion. It did, at any rate, at the 11th ClaremontMonetary Conference, held late last month on the campus ofthe Claremont Colleges, Claremont, Calif.   This conference, like the others, was organized by RandallHinshaw, an emeritus professor at Claremont Graduate School,who, among his other virtues, seems to have known everyone inthe profession worth knowing in the past 40 or 50 years.   The conference has met irregularly since 1967, either atClaremont or in Europe. There were 16 participants at thelatest session, mostly distinguished members of theprofession who represented varying points of view. RobertMundell of Columbia spoke for fixed rates; he would like areturn to gold but believes gold's market price is now toounstable. Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, on the other hand,felt that floating rates would be the best hope for some timeto come.   There was agreement that a single European currency wouldbe nice. Richard Cooper of Harvard felt that a common marketdemanded a common currency. Mr. Friedman agreed that a singlecurrency would be fine -- if you could get it, which hedoubted.   Some conferees seemed to feel that Europe had been doing apretty good job of managing its monetary affairs and wasready to move on to greater integration. Others, however,thought that recent success had stemmed largely fromacceptance of the dominance of the Bundesbank. The Germancentral bank has largely set policy for Europe.   &quot;It's as though the Federal Reserve Bank of San Franciscowas setting policy for the United States on the basis of whatwas happening in California,&quot; said Paul Krugman, an economistat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   How can Europe coordinate policy to make a common currencypossible? Jeffrey Frankel of the University of California atBerkeley argued that monetary policy should target nominaleconomic growth. But Otmar Issing, a member of the board ofthe Bundesbank, was dubious: &quot;My problem with nominal GNPtargeting,&quot; he said, &quot;is implementation. We would have towork through the money supply, and there would be acontinuing problem of overshooting or undershooting.&quot;   Milton Friedman thought there was much to be said fornominal GNP targeting but was worried about accountability:&quot;With a nominal GNP target you'd have to wait a long time tosee if you'd hit it.&quot;   Christopher Johnson, chief economic adviser to Britain'sLloyds Bank, agreed with Mr. Friedman: &quot;We've been usingnominal GNP targeting for six years, and look at our economytoday.&quot; Britain has high inflation and is also sinking into arecession.   The key question for most conferees was whether Europeancountries would be willing to give up enough sovereignty tomake a common currency work. Mr. Mundell, however, said themove toward unity could be speeded up if the Bundesbankplayed European central bank and the common currency wasbased on the deutsche mark. For some time the key decisionswould be made by the Bundesbank.   Mr. Issing of the Bundesbank was appalled by this idea. Henoted that there was still a good deal of fear in Europeabout the dominance of a newly unified Germany.   The tentative date for a common European currency is theyear 2000, and perhaps such a goal is achievable. But therewas a good deal of doubt at Claremont. One participantmentioned that the Scottish pound is legal tender throughoutBritain, but sometimes London cabbies won't accept it.   A common currency would require a little more politicalunity than now exists, since the monetary authority wouldhave to report to someone -- preferably, someone with alittle more clout than the existing European Parliament.   At least one participant left Claremont convinced thatgreater European unity was desirable but that it would taketime -- perhaps a great deal of time. No matter how muchnations talk of coordination, in Europe as elsewhere nationalinterests remain paramount.</TEXT></DOC>
