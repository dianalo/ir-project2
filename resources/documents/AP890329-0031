TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>RAS AL BAYADA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 5,000 Palestinianfighters are massing in southern Lebanon in a major buildup thatcould threaten Israeli settlements near the border, Israelimilitary commanders say.   The officers spoke to journalists visiting Israeli'sself-designated security zone on Tuesday, when Palestinian fightersblew up an Israeli outpost and a second guerrilla squad wasreported captured in the zone.   Lebanese police said a remote-controlled explosion leveled atwo-story building used by the Israeli army and its allied militia,known as the South Lebanon Army, on the eastern edge of the Israelibuffer zone.   A police spokesman said two SLA militiamen were injured and anarmored personnel carrier was destroyed in the blast at theZumarraya crossing point into the Israeli zone, 1.8 miles north ofthe Lebanese town of Hasbaya.   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing rules,said guerrillas of the radical PLO faction Democratic Front for theLiberation of Palestine were responsible.   Israeli officials described the target as a bunker and said onlyone SLA militiaman was injured in the blast.   Israeli military commanders said Palestinian fighters werestaging a major buildup just north of the Israeli-controlled zone.   Brig. Gen. Nehamiya Tamari, commander of troops stationed alongthe 100-mile-long Israeli border, estimated the number ofguerrillas to be about 5,000, of whom about 600 to 700 were inrefugee camps around the Lebanese city of Tyre.   ``The importance is not their numbers, whether it's 5,000 or6,000, but the type of threat that they pose,'' he said. ``If theymake it hard for people to live (in northern Israel), we will haveto make some kind of decision about an operation.''   Other commanders also referred to the Palestinian threat andsaid that in the past three months, 29 guerrillas were killed in 10attempts to infiltrate Israel.   Israeli sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggestedthat a successful Palestinian attack on civilians across the bordercould prompt Israel's army to launch a ground operation to uprootthe Palestinians in the Tyre area, 14 miles north of the border.   Capt. Avi Hai, an Israeli officer who briefed the journalists,also warned of possible retaliation by Israel's army.   ``The IDF (Israel Defense Force) will hit and hit hardPalestinian centers if these centers will turn into a threat to thenorthern border,'' he said.   Israel invaded south Lebanon in 1978 to drive out PalestineLiberation Organization guerrillas and in 1982 staged a majorinvasion north to Beirut to force PLO chief Yasser Arafat from hispower base in Lebanon.   The 1982 war in Lebanon led to a three-year occupation of theLebanese south, which ended in 1985 with Israel creating the six-to10-mile zone to protect its northern settlements.   Tuesday's tour of the region was the first such army-sponsoredtrip in more than six months. Reporters traveled in four trucksguarded by two armored personnel carriers, four jeeps and atruckload of soldiers.   At Ras Al-Bayada, the entrance to the security zone on the coastsix miles from the border, Israeli officials displayed the weaponscarried by the two guerrillas captured Tuesday near the town ofBint Jbail.   Included were two U.S.-made anti-tank weapons, two Soviet-madeAK-47 assault rifles, nine clips of ammunition and three handgrenades.   Israel radio said one of the captured guerrillas was a member ofArafat's Fatah PLO faction and the other belonged to theSyrian-based Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.   On a mountain ridgeline west of Ras Al-Bayada, an Israeliofficer identified only as Lt. Col. Udi pointed out the sprawlingRashadiya refugee camp near Tyre, where he said many Palestinianguerrillas were hiding.   He said the guerrillas lacked the long-range artillery needed tostrike either the security zone or Israel itself. Israel's northernarmy commander, Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, said only one rocket attackagainst Israel had been reported so far this year, compared to 26last year and 80 in 1986.   The largest weapons the guerrillas have are 107mm Katyusharockets and 60mm heavy mortars, neither of which could span the sixmiles separating his outpost from the guerrilla camp, Udi said.   ``In order for them to strike us, they would have to advance outof their camps,'' said Udi, standing behind a coil of barbed wireat the edge of a deep, jagged ravine that provided a naturalbarrier to any attack.</TEXT></DOC>
