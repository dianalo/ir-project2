Neuthaler as chairmanand chief executive.   The publishing group had been without a permanent leader sinceAlberto Vitale left to take over Random House at the start of theyear.   Officials of the parent company said Wednesday that the searchwas prolonged by the difficulty of finding an executive withcredentials in both books and finance, the New York Times reportedThursday.   The choice of Neuthaler, a relative unknown, appeared to beconnected with Bertelsmann's desire to push into scientific,technical and professional publishing in the United States.   Neuthaler, 47, had directed a fruitless effort by the company inthe middle 1980s to develop a technical publishing arm in thiscountry.   He then left to become a partner of JPT Publishing Group,financial, scientific and market research publishers.   Bantam Doubleday Dell is a general-interest, or trade,publishing group for which Bertelsmann paid $475 million threeyears ago.   Bernhard von Minckwitz, a Bertelsmann board member who had beenacting chief executive during the search for a new chairman, willremain with the group with the new title of executive chairman andNeuthaler will report to him, Bertelsmann said.</TEXT></DOC>
