Askyour disgruntled local florist.   Thousands of mothers across the country didn't get their rosesor daffodils on Mother's Day this year because the phone system letthem down, and florists took the heat for it.   ``Our customers thought that we were lying to them,'' saidJacqui Apostolides, office manager of Manhattan's Academy FloralCo., which belongs to the FTD network.   The real culprit was a fire in a suburban Chicago central-officeswitching center on May 8 that knocked out service to Florists'Transworld Delivery Association.   The Hinsdale, Ill., fire caused one of the most serious U.S.telephone outages in years. Besides FTD, it temporarily disabledthe reservations center for Holiday Inns and a communications linkfor air-traffic controllers at O'Hare Airport.   The last set of customers with impaired service was scheduled tobe moved to a new switch Sunday at 12:01 a.m. CDT. But thedeficiencies revealed by the fire continue to exist throughout thenation's phone system.   Overall, the nation's phone system is reasonably secure, butcentral-office switches such as the one in Hinsdale are itsAchilles' heels, according to interviews with phone companyexecutives, government officials and independent consultants.   In addition, deregulation has accelerated competition, much asin the airline industry, and has increased temptations for phonecompanies to cut corners on safety to save money.   While phone company officials say they continue to give toppriority to security issues, the Defense Department and otheragencies are stepping up their scrutiny of potentialvulnerabilities in the wake of the Bell System breakup.   ``All the changes that have been made have left emergencypreparedness as a poor sister,'' said John C. McDonald, chairman ofa National Research Council panel that was funded by the DefenseDepartment and other federal agencies to examine the phone system'ssecurity.   ``What's lost in this is any element of national welfare,'' saidMcDonald, who is vice president and chief scientist of ContelCorp., an Atlanta-based phone company.   Phone disruptions hurt more today because Americans depend ontelecommunications more than ever, for such things as departmentstore credit checks and automatic-teller machines.   High technology contributes to the phone system's safety in somecases, but detracts from it in others. Technology made it possiblefor Illinois Bell to leave the Hinsdale central office unstaffedand monitor it from Springfield, 200 miles away. But that meant noone was around to snuff the fire when it broke out.   The Hinsdale fire department could not be notified for more thanan hour because its own phones were knocked out. Incredibly,Illinois Bell had no quick backup method of reaching the firedepartment.   Central offices are Achilles' heels because there is no easy wayaround them. A medium-sized city may have one, while large citieshave several. All the calls in the area will go through itsswitches, to be sent across town or funneled onto a long-distancenetwork.   To protect themselves from failures at the central office, bigcompanies are increasingly opting for the controversial solution ofbypassing the local switch and plugging directly into long-distancenetworks.   But bypassing the local phone companies deprives them ofrevenue, making it even harder for them to afford the improvementsthat would lessen their vulnerability.   Residences and small businesses are forced into dependence onthe local phone company because they can't afford the satellitedishes or fiber-optic cables they would need to get around thecentral office.   ``Somebody like the local Domino's Pizza, they're out of luck,''said Steven Glagow, manager of strategic business services forCoopers andamp; Lybrand in Houston.   Outlying areas have become more vulnerable because phonecompanies are saving money by closing some smaller central officesand replacing them with so-called remote switching units.   If a line breaks between the remote switching unit and thecentral office where the switching is actually done, the area isleft without local phone service. In the old days, the line breakwould have affected only attempts to call outside the local area.   Long-distance networks are more secure than the local portionbecause calls can be routed around a place where there is a break.   But that doesn't mean there are no problems with long-distancecalls. In the era of fiber optics, when thousands of calls can becarried over a single strand of glass, a misdirected backhoe cancause more damage than ever.   This past week, for example, telephone service into and out ofSan Francisco over the MCI Communications Corp. network wasdisrupted for about five hours after a road grader broke afiber-optic cable.   To lessen its exposure to a fiber cut, American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. has two geographically separated fiber cables overmajor routes, such as the Boston-to-Washington corridor and betweenthe East and West coasts. It is laying a third over each route.Rivals are using the same strategy.   ATandamp;T is building a separate network whose sole job is toestablish the paths that long-distance calls will take. Thatsignaling network makes it easier to route around problem areas.   Skeptics say the creation of a signaling network makes thingsmore vulnerable because the completion of a call now depends on theproper functioning of two networks. But ATandamp;T defends thereliability of the signaling network.   Deregulation has splintered the phone industry in ways thatreduce flexibility in response to a disaster. For example, phonecompanies are installing many different brands of switches. If onebreaks down, it takes longer to get a replacement than if all ofthem came from one source _ which used to be ATandamp;T's WesternElectric Co.   Trouble could also result from the fragmentation of the phonesystem into rival public and private networks that don'tinterconnect.   The National Communications System, a group of federal agenciesprimarily funded by the Pentagon, is taking early steps to buildlinks between the networks so the government can commandeer as muchtransmission capacity as it needs in a national emergency.   More is better when it comes to safety in the phone system _more switches and more cables in more places, and more variedmethods of transmission. ATandamp;T, for example, is supplementing itsmain network with microwave radio transmission in a new digitalformat.   Illinois Bell defends its attention to the security of its phonenetwork, although it says it plans to study such issues as why itwas not able to reach the fire department for more than an hour.   ``There'll be those that say that more can be done. But thequestion is, Who do you have pay for that? ... It really gets tothe central issue of affordability of telephone service,'' said TimBannon, an Illinois Bell spokesman.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday June 5</NOTE></DOC>
