Richard Boucher, the State Department's deputy spokesman, saidelection observers sent to Romania by the Bush administrationreported voting was ``free, peaceful and enthusiastic,'' and thatturn out was heavy with long lines at the polls.   ``We note that problems with voting and other election dayirregularities appear to have been minimal, although oppositionpolitical party leaders have complained of breaches of election lawprocedures,'' Boucher said.   ``We see this as an important beginning for Romania,'' he said.   But he said the election campaign itself was flawed bycandidates' lack of access to the news media and the intimidationof opposition candidates, he said.   ``Further improving the process of democracy will be a key taskof whatever government emerges in Romania,'' Boucher said.   Boucher said there were no conclusions about possible U.S.economic aid to Romania because ``our assessment of the electionsis only now beginning.''   The first official returns in Romania showed interim PresidentIon Iliescu, a former Communist, with an overwhelming lead in thepresidential race. His National Salvation Front appeared to beheaded for victory in the parliamentary elections, which wouldallow him to govern without forming a coalition with the opposition.</TEXT></DOC>
