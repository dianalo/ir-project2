The new laser, which transmits light at 28 billion pulsesper second, isn't the world's fastest. ATandamp;T BellLaboratories, for example, devised a laser earlier this yearthat transmits 350 billion light pulses a second.</LP><TEXT>   But the Cornell laser can be frequency-modulated to handlevastly larger amounts of data than other lasers, according toLester Eastman, who led the team of five scientists whodeveloped the device. Their 28 gigahertz, or GHz, lasersurpasses a previous mark of 24 GHz set by GTE Corp.scientists in Waltham, Mass., this year.   &quot;It's a different class of laser than ours, which needs aseparate (electronic) device to modulate it,&quot; said DavidLang, director of Bell Labs' Compound Semiconductor DeviceResearch. &quot;However, (Eastman) has coupled basic laser physicswith advanced microwave technology. It's an excellentdesign.&quot;   The 28 GHz laser can carry about 2.8 billion words asecond, Dr. Eastman said -- or, for example, the first nameof every person on earth in about two seconds. In addition,future communications systems using the new lasers couldcarry 2,800 TV channels at once, although Dr. Eastman admitsthat so many channels could cause much confusion toconsumers.   Most likely, the devices, called &quot;strained quantum welllasers,&quot; could find their way into military equipment, suchas high-speed microwave radar systems being developed byGeneral Electric Co. and data communications systems foradvanced computers of the future, Dr. Eastman said. Cornell'sresearch was funded by GE, International Business MachinesCorp., the Office of Naval Research and the Defense AdvancedResearch Project Agency.   Dr. Eastman said the laser can operate at any frequencyfrom one to 28 GHz, a wide frequency range, which provides acorrespondingly large information-carrying capacity. Bycontrast, he said, most other ultra-high speed lasers can'tbe modulated to handle more than a few gigahertz of signalsat once, thus retarding their information-handling capacity.   Cornell's device measures three microns by 100 microns, orsmaller than a grain of sand, and is made of gallium arsenidelaced with aluminum and indium.   But what really gives the laser its kick is the quantumwells within its package of semiconductor material. Electronspour into these wells, each no more than 40 atoms thick, andexit in the form of photonic waves, a process known as&quot;lasing&quot; in scientific jargon.   Dr. Eastman said his team then connected the laser deviceto a &quot;microwave sweeper,&quot; which sent microwave currents up to28 GHz. These passed through the laser and exited in the formof corresponding light pulses.</TEXT></DOC>
