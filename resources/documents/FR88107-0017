The Department requests the speakers to provide suggestionson revising Part 379 (``Technical Data'') of the Export AdministrationRegulations (EAR) in order to clarify the regulatory provisions, furtherU.S. export control objectives, and better serve the needs of the U.S.business community. Points of view should address, but are not limited to, the following:   1. The effectiveness of technical data controls in preventing diversionof U.S. technology;    2. The compatibility of the application of technical data controls withinternational agreements and existing business practices;    3. Alternative definitions of ``operation'' technical data, ``sales'' technicaldata, ``direct products'' of technical data, and ``software'';    4. The application of technical data controls to COCOM countries, non-COCOMfree world countries, the People's Republic of China, and Eastern Europeancountries;    5. Revisions of the licensing requirements (general and validated) coveringtechnical data;    6. Licensing requirements related to training materials and servicing ofcontrolled commodities;    7. Written assurance requirements outlined in andSection; 379.4(f) of theEAR;    8. Technical data reexport provisions outlined in andSection; 379.8 of theEAR;    9. Licensing requirements for ``direct products'' of technical data;   10. Exports by disclosure to foreign nationals;    11. The treatment of know-how as retaining its U.S.-origin even thoughcommingled with foreign know-how;    12. Application of the technical data controls to plant tours by foreignnationals;    13. The limitation of the ``sales'' technical data provisions in GTDR toonly ``sales'' technical data that is not related to a commodity identifiedby the code letter ``A'' following the Export Control Commodity Numberon the Commodity Control List;    14. Application of the technical data controls to exports of software soldin retail stores;    15. The availability of GTDA for know-how on the public record in the formof a patent, copyright, or other intellectual property;    16. The control of all software for computer-aided design, manufacture,inspection or test of an ``A'' item on the Commodity Control List;    17. Control of technical data exported via satellite;    18. Control of technical data sold by software banks and data utility banks;   19. The appropriate terms and conditions for a comprehensive operationslicense for technical data;    20. Additions or deletions of critically controlled items that are subjectto Part 379 controls; and    21. Other suggestions or options for amending the technical data controls.   The Militarily Critical Technologies List Implementation Technical AdvisoryCommittee (MITAC) has proposed a revision of the technical data controls.Commerce requests comments on the MITAC proposal. A copy of the MITAC proposalmay be obtained from Ms. Toni Jackson, Department of Commerce, Room 3886A,14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230, Telephone:(202) 377-8760. The Forum will begin with a presentation on the MITAC proposal.           <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Purpose of Controls</ITAG>The Department of Commerce requires specific authorization for any exportof technical data controlled for national security or foreign policy reasons.As defined by andSection; 379.1 of the EAR, ``technical data'' is informationof any kind that can be used, or adapted for use, in the design, production,manufacture, utilization, or reconstruction of articles or materials. Thedata may take a tangible form such as a blueprint, prototype, model, oran operating manual; or they may take an intangible form, such as technicalservice. All software is considered technical data.The Department of Commerce imposes controls only when such controls arenecessary to further fundamental national security, foreign policy, orshort supply objectives. The Department intends that any review of controlson commodities or technology will be conducted in consultation with representativesof appropriate U.S. Government agencies and private industry. To this end,the Forum on technical data controls will provide industry an opportunityto contribute toward regulatory revisions and clarifications. This effortwill better serve the interests of both the U.S. Government and exporters.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Basis for Controls</ITAG>Pursuant to Part 379 of the EAR, exports of technical data must be madeunder either a Department of Commerce general license or an individualvalidated export license. General Licenses GTDA and GTDR apply to specifictypes of exports of technical data. A validated license is required forany export of technical data where these general licenses do not apply,except in the case of certain exports to Canada. Section 379.3 and 379.4outline the requirements for shipments of technical data under GTDA andGTDR; andSection; 379.5 outlines the requirement for export of technicaldata under a validated license.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Notes on Current Implementation</ITAG>Generally, applications for the export or reexport of technical data tomost free world destinations are considered favorably on a case-by-casebasis, unless there is a significant risk that such technical data willbe used or diverted contrary to the objectives of specific export controls.Section 379.4(a) of the EAR prohibits the export of technical data to CountryGroups S and Z under General License GTDR. Section 379.4(b) provides forcertain restrictions on the export of technical data under GTDR to CountryGroups Q, T, V, W and Y, Afghanistan and the People's Republic of China.Exports and reexports of technical data that do not fall within the requirementsof either General License GTDA or GTDR are subject to a validated licenserequirement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 5, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Vincent F.
