(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Once a darling of the running-gear boom,Moss Brown andamp; Co. stumbled on its way to becoming a $100million-a-year business in the nation's capital.   Now, its founder is starting over in a storefront 80 milesnorthwest of Yellowstone National Park.   The grain elevators and muddy pickup trucks in this tiny farmingcommunity are a far cry from the pricey Georgetown section ofWashington, D.C., where Henry Barksdale's Moss Brown andamp; Co. built areputation as a rising star of the running and outdoor clothingmail-order business.   In the heady days of 1984, Barksdale was pictured on the coverof the Washington Post Magazine and Moss Brown was named to Inc.magazine's list of the 500 fastest growing companies in America.   But Barksdale's boom went bust in Washington _ the victim, somesaid, of trying to run too fast _ and after working through aChapter 11 bankruptcy court reorganization, his enterprise hasemerged with a new name and a relatively clean slate.   ``As far as I know of, everyone has been taken care of,''Barksdale says of the customers who filed claims against Moss Brownfor undelivered merchandise.   Barksdale's new firm, appropriately called Runwest Inc., hasacquired the Moss Brown trademark, but the company is a muchsmaller and perhaps less ambitious version of the original.   Back in Washington, Barksdale thought nothing of firing off 12million catalogs and churning out Gore-Tex running suits by thetens of thousands.   Today, in Belgrade, employees take a more leisurely pace,quietly stuffing garments into mailing envelopes by hand whilelistening to music on a radio.   ``I feel really welcome here,'' the 59-year-old Barksdale toldthe Bozeman (Mont.) Daily Chronicle in a recent interview.``Everybody is so open. It's sort of like when I was a kid growingup in St. Louis. I'd forgotten that people were really like that.''   While describing banks in Washington as ``basically justcomputers,'' Barksdale says the vice president of Valley Bank ofBelgrade walked over and introduced himself the day Barksdale movedin.   ``That's a different experience than you'd have back in D.C.,''he said.   With $8 million in sales in 1984, Moss Brown was being hailed asthe L.L. Bean of the running set.   ``If we were doing $15 million a year in sales, I'd probablystill be there,'' Barksdale said. ``But I'm not sure I'd be happy.''   What happened to him in Washington is a classic case of reachingtoo far too fast.   ``We made good money until 1983,'' when Moss Brown earned$200,000 in profits, Barksdale said. ``Then I decided to turn itinto a big company.''   From mailing orders in the back of his Georgetown retail store,Barksdale moved the mail-order business into a 40,000-square-footwarehouse in suburban Alexandria, Va. And he expanded the mailinglist, achieving those 10 million to 12 million mailings a year, bypurchasing or renting costly mailing lists from other firms.   These expansion moves added huge costs to the business withoutadding enough revenues to pay for them _ at a time when the runningboom was beginning to fade.   ``We added customers faster than we were able to generatemerchandise,'' Barksdale admits.   Don Chilcutt of Direct Media, an Edmond, Okla., broker ofmailing lists for mail-order companies, agrees with that soberassessment.   Barksdale was ``prospecting'' for new customers by leasing orbuying millions of new names to add to his mailing list, Chilcuttsaid, but his known buyers couldn't support the expansion.   ``You can't support a 10 million mailing with only 123,000customers,'' Chilcutt said.   Last March, Moss Brown filed for bankruptcy protection, havingpiled up $2.15 million in debts, $1.7 million of it unsecured.   Mark Holmstrup, an investigator at the City of Alexandria'soffice of consumer affairs, says his office received some 150complaints from customers of Moss Brown, most coming at the end of1986 and in early 1987.   Customers complained Moss Brown never sent the merchandise theyordered, even though the company billed customers' credit cards orcashed customers' checks, Holmstrup says.   After mailing new catalogs to customers and offering credits tothose who filed complaints, Barksdale contends his debts have beensettled. And he says he gets letters daily from people saying theyare glad he's back in business.   But this time, Barksdale says he'll be satisfied with beingsmall in beautiful Montana. Asked about his goal for the fledgling,reorganized company, he says he'd like to see sales of $1 million ayear by 1989.   ``I don't want to get that big anymore,'' he said. ``We made alot of money and had a lot of fun, but my wife would kill me if Imake the business even as big as $5 million again.''</TEXT></DOC>
