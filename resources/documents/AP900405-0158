Pvt. Gerald Pierre, 20, who commandeered the Airbus A300 in anapparent attempt to desert the army, vanished into the darkness atabout 1 a.m., according to Radio Haiti Inter.   Officials offered no explanation for how Pierre escaped policeand soldiers guarding the airport, leading to speculation the armyallowed him to flee to peacefully resolve the affair.   ``The Army High Command conducted the operation. They haven'tgiven their report yet,'' said Alfred Mentor, the InformationMinistry director.   The army had no immediate comment, and it was not known whethera search for Pierre was underway.   Haiti-Inter, whose reporter witnessed the escape, said Pierreleaped from the plane in the early morning dark and raced acrossthe tarmac toward a field of high grass near the terminal.   Soldiers and police were guarding the airport but had notsurrounded the 10-foot-high perimeter fence, and Pierre could havefled over an unguarded portion of it.   Officials reopened the airport Thursday. It was closed Wednesdayafter Pierre reportedly fired a machine gun in the direction of aHaiti Trans-Air flight shortly after it landed on a flight fromMiami.   The U.S. Embassy said American Airlines would send investigatorsto examine the jet before it left the airport.   Pierre had allowed passengers and crew members to leave the NewYork-bound Flight 658 on Monday shortly after seizing the jet. OnTuesday, he threatened to blow up the plane unless he was flown toUnited States, Radio Haiti-Inter said.   Radio reports said Pierre, who also was an airport securityguard, was carrying grenades and the machine gun when he tookcontrol of the U.S. plane.   Pierre was trying to desert after being reprimanded by anofficer for alleged insubordination, the reports said. He hadserved in the army two years.   Radio Metropole said military authorities had offered Pierreimmunity from prosecution if he surrendered and resigned from thearmy.</TEXT></DOC>
