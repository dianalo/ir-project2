(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents voted overwhelmingly to change thecity's 81-year-old form of government to give blacks a politicalvoice, prompting the NAACP to say its discrimination lawsuit hadbeen settled ``out of court.''   Voters approved the change to the city's 1908 charter Tuesday by33,373 votes, or 70 percent, to 14,213 votes, or 30 percent,according to complete unofficial election results.   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoplesued Tulsa in 1987, contending that at-large balloting for citycommissioners unconstitutionally diluted the minority black voteconcentrated in north Tulsa, where 75 percent of the city's 42,000blacks live.   The new charter creates a council with nine members to be electedby district, including one in north Tulsa. The mayor, who gainspower under the new charter, continues to be elected at large.   ``The result of the election was the basis of our lawsuit,'' saidHubert Bryant, an NAACP attorney. ``We claim victory. This issomething that the citizens of Tulsa brought in, but it was onlypossible by the filing of our lawsuit. We are delighted that we wereable to settle this out of court.''   Attorneys are scheduled to meet here March 9 with U.S. MagistrateJohn Leo Wagner to determine the lawsuit's status under the newcharter. But Bryant said NAACP attorneys believe the charteraddresses the lawsuit's concerns.   ``We are satisfied, but the court now must be satisfied,'' hesaid.   Election board officials had predicted a turnout of about 50,000of the city's 225,000 registered voters Tuesday. But poll workerssaid they were busier than expected despite rain.   The NAACP lawsuit claimed Tulsa had a history of racialdiscrimination that dated back to a 1921 race riot and continuedthrough the city's government. A north Tulsa black has never beenelected to the city commission.   Tulsa voters have rejected four attempts in 35 years to changethe city's government. A 1969 proposal failed by 63 votes out ofmore than 23,000 cast. The most recent, a 1973 proposal, wasdefeated by a wide margin.   Similar lawsuits in other cities have prompted federal judges toorder a change to a more representative government. The NAACP filedits lawsuit against Tulsa after winning a similar case inSpringfield, Ill.   Tulsa's traditional government has allowed commissioners to servein executive and legislative functions. Under the new charter, themayor becomes the chief executive responsible for day-to-dayoperations, while the nine-member council elected by districthandles legislative matters and approves mayoral actions.   `What Tulsans have proved is that this is a city with theconfidence to make this kind of major change,'' said Mayor RodgerRandle, who along with the city's four other elected commissionerscampaigned in support of the new charter.   ``This is something I've thought we should have had for manyyears,'' said Police Commissioner Bob Dick, the lone Republican onthe commission who as a young Tulsa police officer enforced thecity's segregation laws.   ``So early on, I was very sensitive to saying there's somethingvery, very wrong here,'' Dick said.   Supporters of the measure had said better representation forblack voters would be one of the benefits of changing the charter.Opponents had said the charter change would give the mayor too muchpower.</TEXT></DOC>
