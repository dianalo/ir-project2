(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Stephen E. CummingsandM;Imagine a data-entry clerk putting together in minutes a report that oncetook three programmers and a week's worth of coding to produce.andP;  That's thesort of power advocates claim for the query-by-example technique of accessingrelational databases.andM;PC relational database-management systems have long had the ability toanalyze and generate reports on vast amounts of data.andP;  The problem with thesedatabase analyses, however, has been the complexity of extracting just theright information from a series of database files.andP;  According to industryobservers, the query by example (QBE) method provides an easy-to-usealternative that makes short work of complicated database analyses, and it isbeing added to an increasing number of PC database-management systems.andM;''QBE is a visual, graphical relational language for querying database filesthat is very intuitive and very easy to use,'' said Moshe Zloof, chiefarchitect for user-interface design at Ashton-Tate, of Torrance, Calif.andO;Previously a longtime IBM employee, Zloof invented QBE in 1974 for use inIBM's mainframe relational-database systems.andM;In a relational database-management system, data elements in one file can belinked to elements in others, according to a series of complex relationshipsdefined by the user, Zloof explained.andP;  The process of extracting a particularset of data by defining the files to be linked, the relationships among them,and the criteria for the desired data is termed a query.andM;Traditionally, users had to write complex programs to query relationaldatabase files.andP;  With QBE, however, the user simply creates an on-screentable representing the desired structure for the query's output.andP;  In thisway, a user can construct sophisticated queries that pull data from multiplefiles without programming, Zloof said.andM;''The idea is that a complicated query that involves linking files, sortingfiles and joining files for reports can be expressed in a single picture, asopposed to requiring multiple steps,'' he said.andM;To start the process of querying a relational database with a QBE system, theuser views a skeletal, tabular representation of each of the data files beingaccessed, Zloof continued.andP;  The names of the fields in each file aredisplayed in columns at the top of the file's table.andM;''The user marks the columns that contain the data he wants to bring into thefinal report.andP;  In the original IBM version of QBE, you would put a 'P' in thecolumn, which means 'present' or 'print' data.andP;  He then fills in the criteriathat will be used to search the data that is being queried by placing acondition element in the column, such as a greater-than or less-thansymbol,'' Zloof said.andM;After the query has been executed by the core database program, theinformation requested from the marked fields is displayed in a new table onthe screen.andP;  The user can further edit the extracted data, format it as areport, or save it as a new database file, he said.andM;Although QBE features have appeared on only a handful of PC relationaldatabase systems to date, analysts say that the query technique is popularamong users and will probably be added to many more products over the nextfew years.andM;''Accessing data by way of a form on the screen is certainly the wave of thefuture,'' said Fred Thorlin, director of the software-industry service atDataquest Inc., a San Jose, Calif., market-research firm.andP;  ''On thedata-entry end, we're seeing the development of forms-processing software.andO;You want the system to work the same way when you're getting the data out,and that's the query.''andM;Nancy McSharry, manager of PC software research at International Data Corp.,andO;a Framingham, Mass., market-research firm, also foresees increasingpopularity for QBE-based products.andP;  ''There is a definite market for QBE.andO;People want something easy to use, and the benefits of not having to programare obvious,'' she said.andM;The first PC-based database-management package to include a QBE feature wasParadox, introduced in 1985 by Ansa Software, and marketed by BorlandInternational Inc., of Scotts Valley, Calif., after Borland bought Ansa in1987, according to Ken Einstein, Borland's director of database strategy.andM;''Paradox was at least the first to popularize QBE for the PC, and now it hasset the standards for the PC market,'' McSharry said.andM;With Paradox's QBE feature, ''you state what your answer is going to looklike and let the system figure out how to go about getting that answer,''Einstein said.andP;  ''This is opposed to a procedural method, which requires theuser to send a set of commands to the system.andP;  With our QBE, the user doesn'thave to state the process by which the result is to be achieved.''andM;According to analyst McSharry, Paradox's QBE facility ''caught the market'seye.andP;  In our quarterly audits, we ask users what they are most likely to buyin the next year.andP;  For database products, the three most common answers areQandamp;A [made by Symantec Corp.], Professional File [from Software PublishingCorp.] and Paradox,'' McSharry said.andM;QBE Boosts ParadoxandM;''Qandamp;A and Professional file are both flat-file managers, which are by natureeasy to use,'' she said.andP;  ''Why is Paradox on the list?andP;  The reason is, it'salso very easy to use, and a lot of that has to do with its QBE features.''andM;The 1988 release of dBASE IV, Ashton-Tate's flagship database-managementsystem, marks the first time QBE has appeared in a dBASE product.andP;  Accordingto Zloof, the dBASE IV implementation of QBE more nearly reproduces theoriginal version he designed for IBM mainframes than Paradox's QBE function.andM;''Aside from the fact that QBE queries have to be translated into dBASE IVlanguage before they are processed, the dBASE version of QBE is very similarto my original design,'' Zloof said.andM;''Paradox copied the concept of QBE, but they have done things verydifferently.andP;  With Paradox you have to do multiple steps to do a sort, to dojoins or to reorder, which is what I was trying to avoid in my initialdesign,'' he said.andM;A number of trends are likely to emerge as the QBE features of PC-baseddatabase software mature, observers noted.andP;  One development is theintegration of QBE as a user interface for queries based on the StructuredQuery Language (SQL), developed by IBM as a standard language for accessingrelational databases.andM;In a combined QBE-SQL system, the user prepares queries using QBE screentables.andP;  The system translates the queries into a standard SQL program, whichit sends to the database engine for execution, analyst Thorlin explained.andM;Although SQL is now being added to many of the full-scale PCdatabase-management systems, none offers a complete QBE-SQL.andP;  On the otherhand, products such as Pioneer Software's Q+E and Quadbase System Inc.'sdQuery, which are designed exclusively to carry out database queries and lackother database-management functions, already have QBE-SQL implementations,Thorlin noted.andM;Another development will be the use of graphics in QBE interfaces, hecontinued.andM;''Until now, QBE has been based on a simple table format, but it's going tobecome a much more graphical thing where you can draw pictures on the screento express relationships between your data,'' Thorlin said.andM;----------Stephen E.
