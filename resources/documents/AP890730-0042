Mrs. Sisulu had been granted a 31-day passport to allow her toaccept an invitation from President Bush to meet with him inWashington.   She met with Bush last month and led a delegation of leaders ofthe banned United Democratic Front in meetings with British PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher, Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlssonand with officials in Belgium and France.   ``I am so happy to be back with my people,'' Mrs. Sisulu toldthe airport crowd.   It took her an hour to get her luggage. The South African PressAssociation quoted a police spokesman at the airport as saying onlythat it had been ``held up.''   The independent news agency also quoted a political activist,who asked not to be identified by name, as saying police ``remindedMrs. Sisulu about her conditions of house arrest and warned her notto make a statement at the airport.''   Mrs. Sisulu had urged Bush and Mrs. Thatcher to impose moresweeping economic sanctions against South Africa to force thewhite-controlled government to negotiate with the black majority.Neither has endorsed such an idea.   The welcoming crowd at the airport sang a Zulu anthem ``GodBless Africa'' and many raised their fists in a black-power salute.They danced and pressed around Mrs. Sisulu as she walked to her car.   Some held placards. One read, ``You strike a woman, you strike arock!'' _ the slogan of a 1956 black women's protest of a lawrequiring blacks to carry passes. Mrs. Sisulu was one of theleaders of that protest campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
