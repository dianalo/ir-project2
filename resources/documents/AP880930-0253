Their petition to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsreflected the aggressive approach that Drexel's defense team hastaken in fighting the Securities and Exchange Commission's sweepingallegations since they were announced Sept. 7.   The defense attorneys asked the appellate court to order U.S.District Judge Milton Pollack to disqualify himself on grounds thathis wife has a financial interest in a company with business tiesto Drexel.   They said in the appeal this ``raises a conflict of interestrequiring his immediate recusal.'' Recusal is a legal term meaningdisqualification on grounds of prejudice.   While the position of Pollack's wife might appear to bias thejudge in Drexel's favor, defense lawyers could fear that if heissued a ruling beneficial to them it could be overturned by ahigher court.   Other attorneys, however, said privately they believed thedefense move actually was aimed at provoking Pollack into anger andthereby forcing the judge to disqualify himself anyway. The81-year-old jurist is known for his no-nonsense approach and strictrulings in securities-fraud cases.   The Drexel appeal was extraordinary because no substantiveissues have even been decided in the case. Appeals courts usuallydo not intervene in lower court proceedings until a decision isrendered.   Pollack has scheduled his own hearing Oct. 11 on earlier defenserequests for him to step aside because of his wife's financialinterest in the Drexel-financed company, Palais Royal of HoustonInc.   The judge was out of town Friday and unavailable for comment onDrexel's appeal, his secretary said. Since the appeal was filedlate in the day, it was unclear how or when the higher court wouldrespond to it.   Earlier Friday, lawyers familiar with the pretrial legalmaneuvering said the Drexel defense also was seeking to not onlyoust Pollack from the SEC case, but from related suits as well.   ``They have now expanded the recusal warfare to include notmerely the SEC suit, but all the class actions filed andconsolidated,'' said David Berger, one of the main lawyersrepresenting groups that have sued Drexel. ``They're trying to getrid of one of the most respected judges in the United States.''   Thomas Curnin, a leading Drexel attorney in the case, confirmedthe defense team had undertaken to remove Pollack from all relatedlitigation but would not elaborate.   Pollack was assigned the SEC-Drexel case because he had beenhearing other civil suits in which defendants include Drexel andIvan F. Boesky, the now-jailed speculator who turned state'sevidence and implicated the firm in a litany of fraud allegationsthat range from insider trading to cheating clients. Drexel hasdenied the allegations.   Curnin also confirmed reports Friday that the SEC had requesteddocuments and other materials from Drexel concerning securitiesbesides the 19 mentioned in the enforcement agency's originalallegations.   The SEC's requests also include information concerning anysurveillance or other investigation of Boesky undertaken by Drexel,Curnin said.   Asked if the SEC move represented a possible broadening of thecase against the firm, Curnin said he did not believe so but saidit ``may be designed to achieve the same results.''   Many lawyers familiar with the SEC-Drexel fight say they thinkthe government has leaked sensitive details about the investigationas part of an effort to pressure the firm and other defendants intosettlement negotiations.   The SEC and the U.S. attorney's office, which is widely known tobe conducting a grand jury investigation into Drexel activities,have denied they are the sources of any leaks.</TEXT></DOC>
