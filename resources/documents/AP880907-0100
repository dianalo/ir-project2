The strikes left only two of 82 mechanized sorting offices inoperation, one in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and one in Gloucester.All 11,000 collection mailboxes in London were sealed.   The national postal service said in a statement that the backlogof undelivered letters and parcels reached 100 million _ equivalentto the amount of mail delivered in two working days.   The Mail Users' Association said the postal dispute was costingBritish industry $43 million a day.   The postal service said talks were under way, but the BritishBroadcasting Corp. reported little progress.   ``We are talking about holding talks,'' said a post officespokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.   South Wales Electricity pledged that no customers would be cutoff during the strike because of unpaid bills.   The National Federation of the Self-Employed and SmallBusinesses, representing about 50,000 small companies, said manycompanies could be in trouble if the strike continues because ofthe delay in receiving checks.   Faced with the threat of empty spaces in letters-to-the-editorcolumns, The Times, The Daily Telegraph and The Independent invitedreaders to send letters by Fax machine, and the BBC invitedlisteners to dictate their letters by telephone.   The labor action began Aug. 31 with a 24-hour strike called bythe Union of Communication Workers, which said it was unfair tooffer bonuses to junior employees only in selected regions.   The weekly bonuses of about $12.52 to $33.40 were given to newstaffers in London and southeast England, where the postal servicehas trouble recruiting and keeping workers. The union maintains thebonuses should be paid to all workers or not at all.   The union represents 140,000 postal workers. The post officesaid today that more than 90,000 of them were on strike.   Many postal workers around the country refused to return to workon Sept. 1 because local managers hired extra temporary workers tohelp clear the backlog of mail. The walkouts since have escalated.   The post office said Tuesday that many union members walked outbecause they were denied large overtime payments after temporaryworkers were hired to clear the backlog.   The union denied this and said the walkouts were provoked bymanagement demands that staff cross picket lines, handle mail fromareas not theirs and sign guarantees that they will not strike ortake other protest action again.   Private couriers are profiting from the labor troubles.   TNT Express U.K., which says it is Britain's largest courier,said its 26 nationwide depots hired extra workers to handle a 400percent increase in business since the strike began.</TEXT></DOC>
