The organization plans to train more than 20 volunteers tocounter crime on the Underground, London's subway system, in the wayit does on the New York City subway.   The Home Office said the four men would be allowed to stay inBritain for six months provided they kept within the law.   Sliwa said he did not object to being interrogated.   ``I'm not bitter,'' he told reporters. ``I would hope they wouldput many other people through (the screening procedure) _ drugdealers, criminal types.''   ``There is plenty of interest locally'' in the Angels, he said.``We're here to complete a mission.''   A Home Office spokesman, requesting anonymity, said theauthorities wanted to establish that the men met ``the requirementsof the immigration rules, and we are now so satisfied.''   Foreign visitors need to satisfy immigration officers that theydo not intend to overstay their visit, can maintain themselvesfinancially without taking a job, and can afford a journey home.   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who is responsible for police andimmigration affairs, and London's police chief, Sir Peter Imbert,made it clear they regarded the Angels as unnecessary.   ``We have police and special constables (unpaid volunteers) andwe have neighborhood watch schemes which are admirable,'' he said,referring to loosely organized groups of residents who reportanything suspicious.   ``We have all kinds of ways in which the active citizen can helpthe police to prevent crime and detect crime. Let us build on thoserather than go in for adventurous departures,'' Hurd said.   Imbert said the Angels had nothing to teach Britain aboutfighting crime.   ``I must say that the first question I did ask myself, andperhaps it's an unfair question, is that when one sees the state ofcrime where they are coming from and then the state of crime here, Iask what it is they can teach us here,'' Imbert said.   During a visit to Britain in September, Sliwa was stabbed in theface in a dispute in a London club with four men who said they didnot want vigilantes interfering with their criminal activities.   Dave Edmonds, the Angels' London coordinator, said he hoped tobegin patrols on crime-plagued sections of the subway in March.   Last month, muggers killed a Turkish student who resisted them onthe London subway and a British man had to have a kidney removedafter being knifed in the back on a subway train. Several womenrecently have been raped on subway trains and in outlying stations.   In the first eight months of 1988, there were 914 reportedrobberies on the subway, up by 83 percent on the same period of1987, and assaults on passengers rose 28 percent to 512.   The 248-station subway network carries almost 700 millionpassengers a year.</TEXT></DOC>
