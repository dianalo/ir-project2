Edward Markey (D., Mass.). &quot;I don't think it will ever be the same for them or those they regulate.&quot;    Four congressional panels are undertaking post-mortems of last Monday's market collapse, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 508.00 points. At least two -- the Senate Banking Committee's securities subcommittee and the House Commerce Committee's finance panel -- will undoubtedly re-examine the 1982 bureaucratic settlement that left the regulation of stock-index futures and other then-exotic financial futures contracts to the CFTC, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Unforeseen at the time of the 1982 accord were the enormous trading volume in stock-index futures and the extent of the interplay between stocks and stock-index futures.    Lawmakers, in assessing the two agencies' performance, will also focus on the impact of computerized program trading on market volatility. &quot;Right now, we have a regulatory black hole,&quot; asserted Rep. Markey, chairman of the House Commerce Committee's finance subcommittee. &quot;No one really has clear jurisdiction over program trading.&quot;    Congress is certain to scrutinize the extent of coordination between the SEC and the CFTC, and the adequacy of the CFTC's margin requirements, futures position limits and other regulations. &quot;My gut tells me,&quot; said Rep. Markey, &quot;that the consensus will be that the jurisdictions should be consolidated into one agency, and that agency should be the SEC.&quot;    Sen. William Proxmire (D., Wis.), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said he favors &quot;centralizing&quot; the regulation of the securities and futures markets in one agency.    But any move to merge the two agencies or to narrow the CFTC's turf would encounter fierce resistance from the futures exchanges and the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. Any diminution of the agency's role would diminish the power of both committees, which oversee the CFTC's activities. And the exchanges are comfortable dealing with those committees, said Kenneth McLean, an aide to Sen. Proxmire.    Fowler West, a CFTC commissioner, acknowledges the existence of a &quot;small gray area&quot; between the two agencies, but he disputes the notion of merging them. &quot;The markets are very different,&quot; he asserted. &quot;The SEC does many things that don't correspond with what we do.&quot;    The merger question periodically haunts the CFTC. But Congress has reauthorized the agency three times since its creation in 1974, reaffirming that its purpose is distinct from the SEC's, noted John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, a trade group.    But former SEC Commissioner James Treadway said, &quot;As the CFTC gets more involved in financial-type instruments, the split regulatory authority creates the potential for things to fall through the cracks.&quot;    Agricultural commodity futures, which accounted for two-thirds of total trading volume ten years ago, have been eclipsed by the phenomenal growth of financial futures. Currently, commodity futures represent only about 20% of the total volume. Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) said he would consider consolidating the regulation of certain financial instruments, but &quot;I don't want to give farm commodities to the SEC.&quot;    Rep. Glickman, an Agriculture Committee member, said that the regulatory framework, much of which dates from the crash of 1929, needs updating.&quot;Now we have a new world based on instantaneous information and the utilization of computers,&quot; he said. &quot;What you've got now is financial markets where you have no time to think.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
