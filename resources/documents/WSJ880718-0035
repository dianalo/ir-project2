At the same time, securities analysts cautioned that IBM's climb may have an interruption in the third quarter, because it will be going through a transition to new mainframes and minicomputers, and old product lines die out faster than new ones can build momentum. Analysts said those problems could continue into the beginning of the fourth quarter.    Several analysts said they were cutting their earnings estimates for the third quarter, probably to around $2.10 a share from $2.30, even though IBM is expected to have a gain of 15 cents a share from selling its MCI Communications Corp. stake back to MCI. The lowered estimates would be up only slightly from the year-earlier $2 a share, or $1.21 billion.    The analysts said they would raise their fourth-quarter estimates by an amount corresponding to their third-quarter cuts, so their predictions for the year won't change. And they said the problems should be behind IBM by next year.    &quot;Looking ahead to 1989, IBM should be hitting on all cylinders,&quot; said Steve Cohen, an analyst at Gartner Securities Corp., Stamford, Conn.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, IBM shares rose $1.75 to $126.50.    In the second quarter, IBM's net income actually fell 18% to $964 million, or $1.63 a share, from the year-earlier $1.18 billion, or $1.95 a share. But that was because of a charge of $364 million, or 61 cents a share, related to a consolidation of its manufacturing operations and a workforce reduction of between 3,000 and 4,000 people. Without the charge, IBM's earnings would have risen 12% to $1.33 billion, or $2.24 a share, a figure near the high end of analysts' estimates.    Revenue increased 6.3% to $13.6 billion from $12.8 billion.    The most encouraging number in the earnings report showed that IBM's costs and expenses rose just 5.8% in the quarter, if the charge for consolidation is discounted. That is well below the 9.2% growth in the first quarter.    &quot;The whole story in 1988 is a cost-control story,&quot; Mr. Cohen said.    IBM benefited in the period from an early-retirement program that got 15,000 people to leave the company last year, helping shrink IBM's world-wide head count to 389,300 at the end of 1987. IBM continued that effort with the manufacturing consolidation announced late last month and has indicated it will continue to shrink staffs at its U.S. operations.    Beyond the cost-cutting benefits, however, little else changed during the quarter. U.S. operations remained weak, with analysts estimating that revenue fell as much as 3% to 4%, while growth in international operations carried the company. Mainframe sales held up, although demand apparently slackened toward the end of the quarter. Minicomputers muddled along, while personal computers sold in huge volume but at such deep discounts that earnings were limited.    Software revenue rose 15%, below the 20% to 25% increases IBM has been reporting, but analysts dismissed the slippage as an aberration related to IBM's product cycles. Maintenance revenue fell only 3.2%, indicating that IBM has had more success fending off the fierce competition it has been facing there.    The drop in the dollar over the past year continued to help IBM in the second quarter, as earnings and revenue from its enormous overseas operations were translated into dollars at a higher rate than a year earlier. But those benefits diminished as the dollar rebounded toward the end of the quarter, and that trend is likely to continue with the dollar currently stabilizing or strengthening.    IBM had a pretax gain of about $100 million in the quarter from the sale of its textbook unit, Science Research Associates, but the effect was offset by a similar gain a year earlier on the sale of some Intel Corp. stock.    In the first half, IBM's net rose 13% to $2.21 billion, or $3.73 a share, from the year-earlier $1.96 billion, or $3.25 a share. The 61-cent-a-share charge for the consolidation was largely offset by a restated first-quarter gain of $315 million, or 53 cents a share, related to a change in IBM's accounting for deferred taxes.    First-half revenue increased 8% to $25.35 billion from $23.48 billion.    Per-share earnings rose a bit faster than total earnings because an IBM stock-repurchase program cut the average number of shares outstanding to 593.5 million from 604 million a year earlier. An IBM spokeswoman said the company has completed its current stock-repurchase program. But it has been buying back about $1.5 billion of stock a year and is still generating large amounts of cash, so IBM is likely to announce a new program in coming months.    ---                           IBM Earnings -                                 1988              1987                              ------------     ------------                              2nd      1st     2nd      1st                              QTR      HALF    QTR      HALF Revenue (in billions)      $13.6    $25.35    $12.8  $23.48 Net (in billions)          $.964*    $2.21**  $1.18  $1.96 Per-share                  $1.63*    $3.73**  $1.95  $3.25   *Includes pretax charge of $600 million, or 61 cents a share, related to consolidation   **Includes pretax charge of $600 million, or 61 cents a share, related to consolidation, plus an after-tax gain of $315 million, or 53 cents a share.</TEXT></DOC>
