The trend for lead-freepetrol could produce new incentives for the use of ethanol. Detailedreports are provided on the application of ethanol in internal combustionengines (ethanol as a mixing component: Increase in octane number, useas solvent; utilization in component synthesis; ethanol as pure fuel)and in the area of diesel engines. Information on this subject coversthe diesel fuel-alcohol mixture (stability of the mixture, combustibility),the synthesis of diesel replacement fuels (vegetable oil esters: Productionof vegetable oils, transesterification, economic viability) and theirapplication in adapted engines. Finally a report is given on the effectsof the use of this alternative fuel ethanol on fuel supplies. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
