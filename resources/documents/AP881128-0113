General Assembly will move swiftlyto provide a forum for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who has beendenied a U.S. visa to address the body, the assembly's presidentsaid today.   Arafat, in his first public comments since the U.S. denialSaturday, called the U.S. move ``a sheer violation of theinternational law and the U.N. charter'' and claimed Washington wasignoring international backing for the newly proclaimed state ofPalestine.   ``Why are they afraid that I speak to world public opinion andexplain the new Palestinian decisions?'' asked Arafat. He spoke toreporters in Iraq.   Foreign Minister Dante Caputo of Argentina, president of theGeneral Assembly, said today in a written statement that the UnitedStates ``is under the obligation to grant the visa'' sought byArafat.   ``As soon as we receive a special request from the Arab group weshall proceed in the best possible manner to ensure that ChairmanArafat is able to address the General Assembly,'' he said.   The 159-member General Assembly was expected today or Tuesday tooverwhelmingly support a request from the Arab nations to convene aspecial assembly in Geneva to hear Arafat. The Arab nations were tomeet today to formulate their request.   The special session, which would be unprecedented for the UnitedNations, would be held either later this month or in January.   Also today, the U.N. Committee on Relations with the Host Countrywas to meet to consider the U.S. decision, which U.N. officials calla violation of the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement.   Under the agreement, the United States agrees not to impede withthe transit or work of U.N. diplomats or guests on U.N. business.   The State Department denied a visa to the Arafat on Saturday,saying the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman ``knows of,condones and lends support to'' terrorist attacks.   President Reagan lauded the decision, saying: ``I think the otherway would have sent out the wrong signal _ that we are patsies.''   Reaction from other nations was largely negative.   Speaking today on CBS ``This Morning,'' a member of the PLOdelegation at the United Nations called the U.S. charges ofterrorism ``nonsense.''   ``It is not serious ... because he (Secretary of State GeorgeShultz) cannot substantiate his allegations,'' said the PLOofficial, Hassan Rahman.   A U.N. statement said that denying Arafat a forum ``would beunfortunate at a time when, in the view of the secretary-general,the recent meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiersprovides fresh opportunities for progress towards peace in theMiddle East.''   The Palestine National Council, the PLO parliament-in-exile,proclaimed an independent Palestinian state during its meeting inAlgiers on Nov. 15. More than 30 countries, most of them Arab, haveformally recognized the state.   The Palestine homeland proclamation implicitly recognized Israelby endorsing a U.N. resolution that guarantees all Middle Eaststates the right to exist in peace. It promised to restrictguerrilla activity.   The Arab League's U.N. ambassador, Clovis Maksoud, said Sunday hehas enough votes to reconvene the General Assembly in specialsession in Geneva so Arafat can address the group.   The non-aligned group in the U.N. has 101 of the 159 votingmembers in the General Assembly. The PLO has non-voting observerstatus.   Earlier this year, Arab and developing nations considered movingthe current session to Geneva when a U.S. attempt to close the PLO'sU.N. observer mission was working its way through U.S. courts.   In March, the General Assembly voted 148-2 to condemn the U.S.attempt to evict the PLO Mission by attempting to enforce ananti-terrorism law. Only Israel joined the United States in votingagainst the resolution.   King Hussein of Jordan and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak haveagreed to spearhead the effort to reconvene the General Assemblyelsewhere, the official Jordan News Agency said Sunday.   Soviet bloc nations also are likely to side with the PLO.   Israeli leaders praised the decision, but Algeria, China, Egypt,France, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands,Sweden and Australia were among other nations that protested it.Italy summoned a U.S. Embassy official to explain the decision.   China's official Xinhua news agency today called the U.S. move``another unwise decision.'' Australia said it regretted the move.</TEXT></DOC>
