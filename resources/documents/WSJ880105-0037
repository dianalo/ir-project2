Lone Star contributed its concrete and aggregates operations and cement-importing terminals in the three states. The Onoda unit is purchasing a 50% interest in the venture for about $60 million.    The venture, Lone Star Northwest, will be managed by Lone Star. It will import cement and produce concrete and aggregates, which are crushed stones used in making cement and in highway construction.    Lone Star, which markets cement, ready-mixed concrete, sand, gravel and crushed stone, said the formation of the venture and Onoda's payment will have a &quot;positive effect&quot; on 1987 net income. The company didn't elaborate.    The formation of the venture is in line with Lone Star's strategy of buying operations in different regions of the country and then forming ventures to operate them. The assets being turned over to the venture were bought in the past two years, a company official said, noting that of Lone Star's operations in the three states, Lone Star is retaining only two oceangoing barges, some dredges and other vessels. </TEXT></DOC>
