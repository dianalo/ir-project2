(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 19-year-old engineering student hasdiscovered a supernova, or exploding star, in a spiral galaxy morethan 137 million light-years from Earth, the California Institute ofTechnology announced Thursday.   Celina Mikolajczak, of San Diego, made the discovery whileexamining photographic films taken on the 18-inch Schmidt telescopeat Palomar Observatory, northeast of San Diego.   Caltech spokesman Robert Finn said Mikolajczak was looking forcomets and asteroids as part of a summer program in whichundergraduates conduct research under faculty supervision.   ``My first thought was that it was a speck of dust,'' saidMikolajczak, who then examined more film and realized, ``Wow, Ithink I've found something.''   The discovery was confirmed with the help of Mikolajczak'sfaculty sponsor, Eleanor Helin, a planetary scientist at JetPropulsion Laboratory, which Caltech operates under contract to NASA.   The supernova, designated SN 1989N, is the 14th discovered thisyear and is much too dim to be seen by the naked eye. It is in theeastern part of the constellation Leo, within a large spiral galaxynamed NGC 3646 located 137 million light-years _ or 806 quintillionmiles _ from Earth. A light year is equal to the distance lighttravels in a year, about 5.88 trillion miles.   Fifteen to 20 supernovas are discovered during a typical year; 27were found in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
