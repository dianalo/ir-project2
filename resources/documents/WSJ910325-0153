And when you addin the other financial assets they own -- including bonds andcommercial paper -- their holdings total about $6 trillion.   In recent years, some of the larger institutionalinvestors have begun to flex their fiduciary muscle. They notonly want to be kept up to date on management thinking. Theyalso want management to know their thinking and respond toit.</LP><TEXT>   Of course, such advice is not always appreciated,especially when management itself comes directly underscrutiny. To avoid such animosity, the institutional investoris best advised to meet with top management about performanceon major issues. If that attempt fails, the company's boardshould be approached to gain its understanding and acceptanceof major shareowner objectives. This is what the nation'sbiggest public employee pension fund -- the California PublicEmployees Retirement System -- has been doing with a numberof corporations, including Sears, General Motors and ITT.   Influencing the performance and direction of a companythrough the board is not something an institutional investorcan expect to accomplish overnight. Here are three specificactions that institutional investors, as shareholders, areboth qualified and entitled to pursue:   1) Ensure boardroom responsiveness. The first step is todetermine if the incumbent directors are conscientious andindependent-minded representatives of long-term shareownerinterests. They should be both able and willing, asnecessary, to stand up to management on behalf of thoseinterests. If the board proves less than satisfactory,institutional investors should press for restructuring and achange in bylaws along these lines:   -- Reduce management representation, thereby increasingthe influence of independent outside directors. Ten yearsago, the average number of inside directors on the boards ofmultibillion-dollar companies was six; last year it was four.During the 1990s, I expect that the number of insiders willdecrease further -- to just the CEO and one or two otherofficers in most cases.   -- Limit membership on all key committees to independentoutside directors only. A committee of outside directors alsoshould be responsible for evaluating the performance ofincumbent board members and producing a slate of newcandidates for the CEO's final selection.   -- Require that the CEO and other inside directors leavethe board on retirement from the company, unless there areunusual, compelling reasons for them to stay during a brieftransition period.   2) Make significant stock ownership a board requirement.All directors elected to the board should be required to makea substantial personal investment in the company's stock andmaintain it as long as they serve. By &quot;substantial&quot; I mean anamount large enough to have real meaning for the individualinvolved -- obviously a bigger holding for a CEO than for auniversity professor. The company could assist an individualin the purchase of the stock, should assistance be required.   In glancing through the proxy statements of variousFortune 500 companies, I was struck by how often shareownersare urged by management to re-elect directors who own no morethan a few hundred shares of common with a market value onlya fraction of their annual director fees. One wonders howdeeply committed to shareowners interests CEO-appointeddirectors can be and how strictly they will hold the CEOaccountable without significant stakes of their own in thecompany.   3) Pay director fees in stock. What better way to ensure acontinuing ownership perspective in the governance of acompany than to have all such fees paid in company stock.(The occasional exception would be any board member who hasto rely on director fees as a source of current income.) Thepayments most probably would be in the form of phantom stockunder a deferred plan so as to accrue tax-free, along withdividends, during the director's term of service and then bepaid out after he or she leaves the board.   On two occasions when I was invited to join a company'sboard, I asked to be paid in stock rather than cash. Neithercompany had ever received such a request, but both agreed toit readily. As my stake in both companies grew, there was noneed to remind myself that as an independent outsidedirector, I had been elected by the shareowners to representtheir interests. You don't have to worry about being aconscientious representative when you're representingyourself.   I know of only one major company that pays its directorsexclusively in stock: Primerica. CEO Sanford Weill is aveteran of the securities business and undoubtedly isdedicated to share ownership as a theory. So far as practiceis concerned, he and other insiders together own or controlmore than 6% of Primerica's stock, about $150 million worth.If it's good enough for them, why not for their board?   By focusing their efforts on strengthening and reinforcingcorporate governance to make it more responsive to theinterests of long-term shareowners, institutional investorswill win some significant victories from which allshareowners, large and small, will benefit mightily.   ---   Mr. Neff is president of SpencerStuart Executive SearchConsultants.</TEXT></DOC>
