The decline gives buyers, lenders and home builders some breathing room during the housing industry's peak selling season.    The decline, reflected in rates offered by many lenders across the U.S., leaves 30-year, fixed-rate loans at about 10% to 10.25%, down from 10.5% to 10.75% two weeks ago. Rates on 15-year, fixed-rate loans have fallen to 9.75% at some lenders. Adjustable-rate mortgages haven't shown appreciable declines; they tend to react slowly to changes in fixed rates.    &quot;The lower rates are clearly a window of opportunity for people who were thinking about buying a house,&quot; says Glenn Crellin, an economist with the National Association of Realtors. Predicts Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association: &quot;Over the weekend, there will be a little more traffic at subdivisions and open houses.&quot;    The window of opportunity, though, may be a narrow one. The interest-rate drop was spurred by Tuesday's bond-market rally over unexpectedly upbeat April trade-deficit figures. The bond market fell sharply yesterday, and if the decline sticks, mortgage rates may give up as much as half their recent drop. Most economists expect the rates to fluctuate a quarter of a percentage point up or down through the summer. And by year-end, fixed rates are expected to hover between 11% and 11.5% on fears of inflation.    Nonetheless, some economists and real-estate professionals say the downward blip this week will ensure the continuation of what has been a surprisingly strong year for housing sales. May sales figures, to be released at the end of June, for new and existing homes are expected to climb for the fifth straight month. Single-family housing starts, which fell 6% in April after a March surge, also are expected to show an increase for May when the Commerce Department releases the figures today.    At these growth rates, 1988 could come close to, or even match, the level of sales and single-family housing starts reported in 1987 and 1986, both of which were banner years, says Michael Wilson, vice president and director of research for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.    The solid results so far this year were recently being supported by adjustable-rate loans, offered initially at below-market rates as low as 7.5% and then adjusted to market rates. When rates were climbing earlier this year, the ARMS provided the housing business with a safety net by continuing to draw buyers. Now that fixed-rate loans have become less expensive, they also are putting a floor under sales. Half of all loans now being written are fixed-rate, compared with 40% this spring, says the Mortgage Bankers Association.    For beleaguered mortgage lenders, the decrease in rates -- which is expected to increase loan volume -- couldn't have come at a better time. Mortgage volume has dropped the past two years, mainly because of dwindling refinancings.    Scores of lenders reduced the rate on their 30-year, fixed-rate loans in the past week, some to as low as 10%. Cal Fed Mortgage Co., a unit of Los Angeles-based California Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, is quoting fixed 30-year loans at 10%, down from 10.38% a week ago. In San Francisco, First Interstate Mortgage Co., a unit of First Interstate Bancorp., Los Angeles, cut its fixed 30-year rate to 10.25% from 10.5% last week. Citicorp in New York trimmed its rate to 10.38% from 10.5%. The indicated 30-year rate required by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. fell to 10.38% on Wednesday from 10.89% early in June, before rebounding to 10.55% yesterday.    The decrease already is bringing in more potential buyers. &quot;The activity level has picked up,&quot; says J. Michael Scheetz, president of Century 21 Scheetz Co. in suburban Indianapolis. He says the number of open houses his firm sponsors for potential buyers climbed about 10% this week as rates on fixed loans began to fall.    Kimball Hill Inc., a suburban Chicago builder, has enjoyed an increase in sales. Since Monday, it's sold nine homes, says Lisa Harry-Porter, senior vice president for sales and marketing. &quot;We haven't sold nine homes in a week since April.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
