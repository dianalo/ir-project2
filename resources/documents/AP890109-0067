The justices said they will review a ruling that the Freedom ofInformation Act imposes such an obligation on the JusticeDepartment's tax division.   Government lawyers, warning of ``enormous administrative costsand burdens'' at taxpayer expense, contend that the 1966 law imposesno such obligation.   Tax Analysts, a Washington-based weekly magazine reportinglegislative, judicial and regulatory developments in federaltaxation, first invoked the FOIA in 1984 in seeking timely copies offederal court opinions and orders from the Justice Department.   Such opinions and orders are available to the public from theindividual courts but the magazine had difficulty in obtaining themquickly.   The Justice Department's tax division turned down the magazine'sFOIA requests, and a federal trial judge upheld the denial.   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last April 29that the government must comply with the magazine's FOIA requests.   ``Imposing an enormous and costly administrative burden on theJustice Department to secure already publicly available material fora commercial publication is certainly not the commonly perceivedpurpose of the FOIA,'' the appeals court said. ``Nonethleless, wecannot find in the words of the statute any exemption to cover sucha situation.''   The appeals court added that ``the burden in this case may not beso excessive as the department makes out.''   Government lawyers estimate that complying with the Tax Analystsrequests on a regular basis would cost nearly $75,000 a year forsearch time alone.   They say commercial publishers and law firms would flood theJustice Department with similar FOIA requests if the appeals courtruling is not overturned.   The appeals court ruled that federal trial court opinions andorders sent to the Justice Department are ``agency records'' underthe FOIA, and that they are being ``improperly withheld'' from thetax magazine.   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers said the appealscourt was wrong on both points.   The case is Justice Department vs. Tax Analysts, 88-782.</TEXT></DOC>
