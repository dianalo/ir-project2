President Augusto Pinochet, the general whose military governmenthas ruled this South American nation since a 1973 coup, has said hewill not run for the presidency but will remain as commander of thearmy.   The army on Friday threatened ``the use of legitimate force'' ifneeded to keep Pinochet as its commander after the elections.   Leaders of the pro-socialist Party for Democracy and two majorfactions of the divided Socialist Party held ceremonies Friday toannounce their support of Aylwin, 70.   ``It's not just a president we are going to elect,'' said RicardoLagos, head of the Party for Democracy. ``We are going to elect theman who will rebuild a democratic system trampled by adictatorship.''   Aylwin, a lawyer and former Senate president, predicted victoryin the Dec. 14 election. His centrist Christian Democrats formChile's largest political party.   ``I'm sure we will triumph,'' he said in a speech accepting thesocialists' support. ``I'm sure we will have a government ofdemocratic reconstruction.''   Pinochet had been expected to run for president, but legalexperts said the constitution, written by his military government,barred him because of a clause prohibiting a president from seekingre-election.   Last Tuesday, Pinochet publicly declared he would not be acandidate, but he also said he would not relinquish command of thepowerful army.   Conservative and pro-Pinochet groups are split over possiblecandidates. The main contenders are Sergio Jarpa, leader of thecenter-right National Renovation Party, and former Finance MinisterHernan Buchi, who is Pinochet's choice but has not agreed to run.   The Christian Democrats, Socialists and Party for Democragy arethe major forces in a 17-party opposition coalition. A coalitionleader, Claudio Vazquez, said Aylwin would be formally nominated onJuly 4.   Leaders of the Communist Party and other far-left parties thatare outside the coalition have said they will not present anopponent to Aylwin but will run their own candidates for Congress.   Coalition members have been negotiating on a single slate ofcandidates for the Senate and House of Deputies.   Aylwin said his platform will include the prosecution of thoseresponsible for human rights violations during the years of militaryrule. He called rights abuses ``an open wound that will not healuntil the truth is discovered.''   Pinochet scheduled the election after voters, in a referendumlast October, overwhelmingly rejected a military proposal that thegeneral remain in power until 1997. The elected government is to beinstalled March 11, 1990, with the president serving a four-yearterm.   The constitution bars the new president from replacing any of theexisting armed forces commanders for up to eight years.   A statement by the army command in Santiago said Friday it hasthe ``mission of safeguarding the constitutional order, eitherthrough representations or, in their absence, through the use oflegitimate force.''</TEXT></DOC>
