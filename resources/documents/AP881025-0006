(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mass killer confined to a psychiatrichospital since his 1949 rampage in which he gunned down 13 peoplecan attend music and horticultural therapy sessions in a geriatricunit, a judge has ruled.   Howard Unruh, 67, has been hospitalized since Sept. 7, 1949, theday after he opened fire on motorists and his east Camden neighbors,dashing through homes and buildings in a murderous rampage.   Psychiatrists who have periodically reviewed Unruh's case foundhim incompetent to stand trial.   Each year, courts have considered Unruh's hospitalization atTrenton Psychiatric Hospital. In 1980, Unruh's attorney soughtdismissal of the indictment to permit Unruh's transfer to a lessrestrictive facility. Three years later, he was transferred from theVroom Building for the criminally insane to an intensive treatmentunit. In 1986, he was granted walking privileges around the grounds.   In documents submitted Monday, defense attorney James Klein askedthe court to transfer Unruh to a nearby geriatric unit. But duringTuesday's Superior Court hearing, Klein withdrew his request, askingonly that Unruh be permitted to attend the special therapy sessions.   Judge I.V. DiMartino granted the request.   Unruh attended the hearing, appearing to be more alert than inpast court visits. He receives medication to keep his schizophreniaunder control, said his psychiatrist, Dr. Manolo Mempin.   Mempin said Unruh is the oldest patient in the unit, which houses29 people, most in their 20s and 30s.   Audrey Holland, program coordinator in the geriatric unit,suggested that the violent nature of other patients in the intensivetreatment unit could endanger Unruh.   ``He's out of place,'' she said. ``The patients are all veryyoung and aggressive.''   Dennis Wixted, first assistant prosecutor in Camden County,opposed any change in Unruh's hospitalization. He called the staffat the psychiatric hospital ``well-meaning, well-intentionedtherapists who are firmly committed to the belief that no one isbeyond help.''   ``Some demon went into Unruh's head and locked his mind at apoint where it can no longer be reached,'' Wixted said. ``We'refaced with that reality.''</TEXT></DOC>
