Xerox said its 51%-owned Rank Xerox unit, whose 49% partner is Rank Organisation PLC, a Britain-based leisure and hotel company, will sell the local business to Altron Group, a big South African electronics firm. Terms weren't disclosed for the sale, which is to be completed by May 1.    The pullout culminates more than a year of agonizing at Xerox, which in December held off a final decision as executives searched for a new approach that might let them stay in the racially troubled land. And the move is unlikely to ease the pressure from activists, who criticized Xerox's plans yesterday to let the unit continue selling photocopiers in South Africa after its sale.    &quot;It's a perfect example of a decision that basically pleases no one,&quot; David T. Kearns, Xerox chairman, said in an interview.    Nor does it please him. Mr. Kearns was one of industry's most vocal proponents of the notion that only by staying can companies help end apartheid and repression in South Africa. His voice grew lonelier late last year when two other outspoken chairmen -- Roger B. Smith of General Motors Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s John F. Akers -- reversed course and pulled out.    Mr. Kearns said he still feels staying put is best for South Africa's 23 million blacks. But he now says leaving is what is best for Xerox. &quot;It was clear things were continuing to deteriorate on all fronts,&quot; he said. The nation's economy and social climate were worsening; pro-disinvestment groups' criticism was rising; and Xerox was beginning to lose sales in the U.S. to local governments that were banning contracts with companies doing business there.    The departure by Xerox, the 14th-largest U.S. employer in South Africa, comes at a critical time for U.S. firms. The pace of pullouts is accelerating, as pressure groups that once praised any departure now say simply leaving isn't enough. The Reagan administration's patient approach toward the South African government has been all but dismissed, even by a Reagan-appointed advisory panel. And a May 31 deadline looms for U.S. companies that follow the Sullivan Principles, fairness tenets that for 10 years provided a moral ground for profiting from sales in South Africa.    The Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, founder of the principles, has said he will urge U.S. companies to leave South Africa if apartheid hasn't ended by May 31 -- a seemingly impossible prospect. That might lead to waves of new withdrawals.    Xerox, based in Stamford, Conn., became the 24th company to announce or complete a withdrawal in the first three months of this year. That compares with 49 corporations in all of 1986. The Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Center says 182 U.S. companies retain South African units and haven't announced shutdown plans; the total was 267 companies less than a year ago.    The financial impact on Xerox will be puny -- the unit provided less than 1% of Xerox's $9.78 billion of annual sales. Indeed, Xerox may have been more alarmed by the financial effects of staying. Last fall Xerox lost out on a photocopier contract with the Pittsburgh school board, which wouldn't buy from South Africa-linked companies.    The lost sales were &quot;certainly a lot more than a few thousand dollars,&quot; Mr. Kearns said, &quot;and it is something we saw increasing&quot; unless Xerox pulled out. But he conceded he still may lose sales to such cities as Los Angeles, which has even tougher rules excluding companies that let their products be sold in South Africa even though they have shed direct investments there.    Most U.S. companies retain distribution agreements with the units they leave behind. Eastman Kodak Co. is one of the few that left and ended all product sales in South Africa. Richard Knight of the American Committee on Africa said cities will &quot;see that Kodak is clean and Xerox isn't.&quot;    But Mr. Kearns countered that blocking all sales would leave workers without jobs and hurt the local units of customers Xerox supplies world-wide.    The criticism of Xerox comes despite the unusual efforts it made in pulling out. It negotiated a promise from the buyer that the unit's 800-plus employees won't lose their jobs. It also is forming a foundation run by black leaders that will spend $500,000 a year on social programs after Xerox leaves. </TEXT></DOC>
