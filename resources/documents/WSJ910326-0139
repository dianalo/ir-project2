This is the high court's first venture into a high-stakescontroversy that will have enormous ramifications for thetobacco industry. If the tobacco companies win, the rulingwill sharply limit the number of personal-injury lawsuitsfiled by smokers or their families. If the smokers win, thedecision may spark hundreds of lawsuits by smokers againsttobacco firms.</LP><TEXT>   The justices agreed to hear an appeal by Thomas Cipollone,whose mother, Rose, a smoker for 40 years, sued three tobaccocompanies in 1983 soon after she had a cancerous lungremoved. Mrs. Cipollone died in 1984, and her husband carriedon the lawsuit until his death in January 1990.   The lawsuit was filed against Liggett Group Inc., a unitof holding concern LeBow, Weksel and Co.; Philip Morris Cos.'Philip Morris Inc. unit; and Lorillard, a Loews Corp. unit.   In an unusual move, the tobacco companies agreed with Mr.Cipollone that the high court should hear the case. Thecompanies said there are so many similar lawsuits pending --at least 45 -- that they wanted the Supreme Court to rule onthe issue.   The issue in the appeal is a technical one involving therelationship between federal and state law. In 1965, Congressrequired tobacco companies for the first time to put warninglabels on cigarette packages beginning in 1966, advisingsmokers that smoking &quot;may be hazardous to your health.&quot; In1970 and 1985, Congress required sterner warnings.   The lawsuit, which has had a complex procedural history,alleged that the cigarette companies failed to warn properlyof the health risks of smoking. The tobacco companies havelong argued that the 1965 law pre-empted state laws thatallow lawsuits for personal injuries.   The issue that the Supreme Court must decide is whatCongress intended when it passed the labeling law in 1965:whether it intended to supercede the personal injury laws ofall 50 states or whether it meant to leave the stateliability systems undisturbed.   In 1984, a federal judge in New Jersey rejected thetobacco companies' argument and allowed the lawsuit toproceed. But before it could get to trial, a federal appealscourt in Philadelphia in 1986 ruled that the federal labelinglaw pre-empts claims based on failure to warn or based onmisleading advertising of cigarettes.   After the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal, thecase went to trial and a jury awarded $400,000 to theCipollone family for their claims based on Mrs. Cipollone'ssmoking from 1942 through 1965, when the federal law waspassed. Specifically, the award was based on the legal theorythat the cigarette companies' pre-1966 advertising carriedwith it a guarantee that the product was safe.   In 1990, the appeals court threw out the $400,000 verdictand ordered a new trial, requiring the Cipollone family toprove that Mrs. Cipollone knew about and relied on the safetyof cigarettes based on the companies' advertising.   The appeals court also ruled that it was bound by itsearlier decision that the federal labeling law bars lawsuitsto hold tobacco companies liable for illnesses related tosmoking after 1965. This part of the appeals court's January1990 ruling led to the appeal that the Supreme Court agreedto decide.   After the appeals court decision, the New Jersey SupremeCourt ruled in a similar case that federal law doesn'tpre-empt state personal-injury lawsuits against the tobaccocompanies. This created a dispute over the meaning of thefederal law.   The high court will hear one hour of argument in the case,probably in October or November, and isn't expected to issuea final decision until spring 1992.   &quot;We're pleased the Supreme Court has accepted this case,&quot;said David Kentoff, a Washington lawyer representing PhilipMorris Cos. &quot;We believe the pre-emption decisions of fivefederal courts of appeal are correct, and we look forward tohaving the Supreme Court resolve the conflict that hasdeveloped in the lower courts.&quot;   However, on Wall Street, tobacco-company stock pricestumbled yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange compositetrading, Philip Morris fell $2.625 to close at $66.875;American Brands Inc. fell $1.875 to close at $44.125; Loewsdropped 37.5 cents to close at $104.25; and RJR Nabisco Inc.ended with a loss of 25 cents at $11.75.   Yesterday, legal observers on both sides agreed that thecase is important for the industry. &quot;This is a bet-the-farmcase,&quot; said Alan Morrison of the consumer-oriented PublicCitizen Litigation Group. He said the case is also importantfor the access to post-1965 industry records that would beprovided in pre-trial proceedings, known as discovery, if thesmokers are able to sue.   &quot;This is a landmark, not only in tobacco litigation but inthe public health fight to try and control smoking because itpromises to put tobacco litigation back on track,&quot; saidRichard Daynard of the Tobacco Products Liability Project atNortheastern University Law School in Boston. &quot;Tobaccolitigation is seen by many in the public health community . .. as the most powerful strategy for reducing smoking.&quot;   Victor Schwartz, a Washington lawyer and expert inliability issues, said, &quot;There have been 20 minor leaguegames on this issue, and all of a sudden this is the WorldSeries.&quot; But Mr. Schwartz, who is monitoring the case forclients outside the tobacco industry, said that even if thetobacco companies lose, he doubts the industry will face&quot;significant liability. It's going to be very difficult toget juries to find liability,&quot; he said. (Cipollone vs.Liggett Group Inc.)</TEXT></DOC>
