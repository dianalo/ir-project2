At a forum, six Israeli peace activists and Arab moderates onSunday praised the PLO parliament-in-exile's declaration of anindependent state as a message of peace and acceptance of Israel'sexistence.   ``The declaration ... was a reward to the Palestinian people whohave been struggling for 11 months and a message to the Israelisthat the Palestinian people accept a Jewish and Palestinian stateside-by-side,'' said Hanna Siniora, a pro-PLO newspaper editor fromeast Jerusalem.   Siniora said the revolt that pits rock-throwing Palestinianyouths against heavily armed soldiers ``made the Israeli peoplerealize that there were another people living under occupationhere.''   Israeli leftists at the forum in Tel Aviv echoed his sentiments.   ``The point is no longer who controls the land,'' said S. Izhar,an Israeli author. ``The point is we can no longer sit on the headsof 1.5 million Palestinians and rule their physical and politicallives. This occupation is destroying us.''   Abie Nathan, a leading peace activist, said, ``I think thechances for peace are better now than they ever were in the past.''   ``It's time to realize that rocks and bullets won't accomplishanything,'' Nathan said. ``I'm sure the Arabs will make moreconcessions and then there will be pressure on (Prime MinisterYitzhak) Shamir from the United States and American Jewry and hewill be forced to moderate his position.''   On Sunday, the violence continued as one Palestinian was fatallywounded during an army raid in the West Bank village of Baqa.   Five Arabs were beaten during an Israeli army raid on the WestBank village of Madama, Arab doctors said. Six others were woundedby bullets in incidents in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,hospital officials reported.   Sunday's death raised to 314 the number of Palestinians killedsince anti-Israel rioting began Dec. 8 in the territories Israelseized in the 1967 Middle East war. Eleven Israelis have also died.   Speaking in English to a largely Israeli audience in Tel Aviv,Siniora, who has been mentioned as a Palestinian negotiatoracceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians, called on Israel toend the violence by negotiating with the PLO.   ``We are extending our hand with an olive branch to call to yourneighbors to take the first step toward peace with us,'' he said.   Israeli peace activists also called on their government to beginnegotiations.   ``The PLO pragmatism has come about despite Israel's hostility,''said Matti Steinberg, a Middle East researcher at the HebrewUniversity's Davis Institute. ``I hope their pragmatism will soon berecognized in our community.''   But in Jerusalem, Israel's Cabinet called the Palestine NationalCouncil's declaration of an independent state in Israel's occupiedterritories ``a jumble of illusions.''   The government said the declaration could not contribute to peacebecause the Palestine Liberation Organization's parliament hadneither renounced terrorism nor explicitly recognized Israel.   ``The PLO was and remains the main obstacle for peace and allthose that support the PLO in this matter are hurting peace,'' anofficial statement released after Sunday's cabinet meeting said.   Elsewhere, an Israeli soldier was killed and four others injuredwhen their armored personnel carrier overturned in a road accidentSunday in southern Lebanon, the army said.   Israel radio said the accident occurred north of the Lebanesecity of Naqoura, two miles from the Israeli border.</TEXT></DOC>
