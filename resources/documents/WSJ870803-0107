A majority of the FCC commissioners have said they consider the doctrine unconstitutional, but the agency hasn't yet scrapped the measure, largely because of fears of congressional action.    But the FCC now seems ready to act. FCC Commissioner James Quello said the agency wouldn't have scheduled the doctrine for consideration tomorrow &quot;unless the idea was to do away with it.&quot;    The 38-year-old doctrine, a creation of the FCC, requires broadcasters airing controversial material to give opponents free air time to respond. Supporters of the doctrine say it ensures that minority viewpoints receive a hearing on television and radio. But detractors say the requirement violates the First Amendment rights of broadcasters and inhibits them from running provocative programs.    At tomorrow's meeting, FCC sources say, the agency will issue a report to Congress on the fairness doctrine, analyzing such alternatives to abolishment as imposing a five-year moratorium, but concluding that it can't constitutionally enforce the doctrine. In addition, the agency will act on a suit involving the doctrine brought by Meredith Corp., a broadcast concern in Des Moines, Iowa, after the commission found that its Syracuse, N.Y., television station had violated the doctrine. The case was remanded to the agency by a U.S. appeals court panel.    The appeals court panel instructed the agency that it could refuse to enforce the doctrine if it found the doctrine unconstitutional or &quot;contrary to public interest.&quot; An FCC aide said the agency still is debating the exact wording of its decision but would use both rationales in scrapping the doctrine. &quot;Public policy and constitutional issues are intertwined,&quot; the aide said.    Sen. Ernest Hollings, (D., S.C.), chairman of the Commerce Committee, which oversees the FCC, accuses the agency of &quot;repudiating the intent of Congress. They're a creature of Congress and tend to forget it.&quot;    Earlier this year, both houses passed by wide margins a measure making the fairness doctrine a law. But President Reagan vetoed the legislation in June, and the Senate has been unable to muster the votes to override the veto.    Sen. Hollings said he would push in September to attach fairness-doctrine legislation to a bill that the president would be loath to veto. He added that House Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) is pursuing a similar strategy. Should such legislation become law, the FCC would be required to enforce the doctrine despite its misgivings.    This newest battle clearly will sour relations between the FCC and Congress, but it probably won't end the fight over the fairness doctrine. Henry Geller, the former FCC general counsel who wrote the fairness doctrine, said the controversy will be decided in the courts.    If the court strikes down the doctrine, he said, broadcasters no longer would be considered &quot;public fiduciaries&quot; under the Communications Act, which regulates television and radio. Under the 1934 act, broadcasters must fulfill certain minimal obligations in exchange for free use of the airwaves. Instead, he said, they might be required to pay for the airwaves.    &quot;There's no such thing as a surgical strike on the fairness doctrine,&quot; he said. &quot;If you knock out the fairness doctrine, the whole Communications Act disappears.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
