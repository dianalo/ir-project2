(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The first Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurantis being restored as a working museum in this southeastern Kentuckytown, which hatched a business that now has $5 billion in sales in58 countries.   Officials working on the restoration hope to finish the projectin time for the 100th birthday of the restaurant's founder, Col.Harland Sanders. The unveiling of the new museum will coincide withLaurel County's 1990 World Chicken Festival.   The restaurant and motel originally were called Sanders Courtand Cafe. That's where the colonel developed and perfected hisfamous recipe and the technique of pressure frying, said WallaceHebert, marketing director for J.R.N. Inc., owner of the franchise.   There are now 7,900 Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in theUnited States and 57 foreign countries, including one in TiananmenSquare in Beijing, China, said Richard Detwiler, a spokesman forKentucky Fried Chicken Corp. Retail sales were $5 billion in 1988,he said.   Franchise owner John R. Neal has wanted to restore the originalrestaurant for many years, said Hebert. It was closed in September1988 and moved to a temporary location next door.   A restoration team is advertising to purchase any artifacts fromthe original restaurant, which opened in 1940, including furniture,menus and kitchen utensils, he said. Members of the community havedonated silverware, old uniforms, tables, chairs and other itemsfrom the old restaurant.   One of the more unusual features of the old Sanders Court andCafe was a model motel room that guests had to pass through inorder to use the bathroom or the pay telephone, said Hebert. Thiswas Sanders' marketing strategy to show people the quality of themotel rooms and boost his motel business, said Hebert.   ``He was a shrewd marketer. He really was,'' he said.   An official with the Laurel County Tourism Commission said hehopes the museum and the chicken festival, which will featurecooking contests, two parades and a Col. Sanders look-a-likecontest, will boost the region's tourist economy.   ``We hope to make this an annual event,'' said Ken Harvey of theWorld Chicken Festival.</TEXT></DOC>
