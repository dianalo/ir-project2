A      first member is used, on the one hand, to ensure fixing of the loadbearing      element to the framework element and, on the other hand, forms part of the      connection structure. A second member is linked to the first member and to      the cladding. In a first embodiment, the first member is a screw screwed      into the framework element, and the connection structure includes a      hollow, cylindrical intermediate piece, a bottom of which is fixed to the      loadbearing element via the screw. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to insulating and leaktight coverings, and in      particular coverings for industrial buildings. </PAR><PAR>  These coverings fixed to a framework comprise a thermal insulation between      a loadbearing element and a cladding. This insulation is principally      realized by plates or panels laid touching one another. These plates are      fastened firmly to the loadbearing element by a mechanical fixing means      when a support consists of profiled steel sheets. </PAR><PAR>  The mechanical fixing means consists of a screw, or a rivet or a bolt      fastened firmly to the profiled steel sheet by drilling or by welding. At      its upper part, a head of the screw, rivet or bolt has a washer of small      dimensions, of a diameter of the order of 50 to 70 mm. </PAR><PAR>  The cladding is fastened firmly to the insulating plates by adhesive      bonding or by welding using a heat source, usually with a flame or air      torch, over the entire surface of the insulating panels and/or at the      level of the washers of the mechanical fixing means. The latter can be      improved for welding by an appropriate surface coating or by a washer made      from the same material as the cladding, and of larger dimensions, placed      in between the metal washer and the underlying insulating panel. </PAR><PAR>  A more recent technique provides for a first bed of foils constituting the      lower part of the cladding to be unwound dry over the insulating panels.      The mechanical fixing means then traverse the foil bed and the insulating      panels. In the case of panels sensitive to the flame of a torch, a prior      heat screen can be employed on the insulator. The upper part of the      cladding is then adhesively bonded or welded to the lower part comprising      its visible washers. </PAR><PAR>  Another technique provides mechanical fixing means at the level of lap      joints of the widths of the cladding. A lapped part is adhesively bonded      or welded, on the one hand, to the edge of the adjacent width and, on the      other hand, to the small washers of the fixing means. </PAR><PAR>  The wind creates considerable localized compression and suction forces on      the covering (vortices, shielding effect behind a wall or a salient part      of the roofing). The forces are exerted on the outer surface and hence on      the cladding, which ultimately stresses the loadbearing element and the      structure of the building. </PAR><PAR>  In the area lying between the cladding and the loadbearing element, these      forces create, at the level of one or more fixing means, tear-away forces      perpendicular and parallel to the covering surface. These latter forces      are more substantial the greater the spacing between the fixing devices.      They can result in the cladding ripping at the head of the fixing means      and/or the fixing means being torn away at the level of their connection      to the framework or the loadbearing element under a torque or traction      effect. </PAR><PAR>  For these two latter techniques, at least one sheet of the cladding is      pierced by the mechanical fixing means. </PAR><PAR>  In all cases, in order to resist the suction forces created by the wind,      the French standards defined within the D.T.U. 43.3 and common practice      provide for a minimum of five fixing means per m.sup.2 of roofing, based      on the fact that a fixing means resists a tear-away force of approximately      900N. </PAR><PAR>  A rupture occurs at the level of the plane of the adhesive bonding of the      cladding to the washer, or as a result of the head of the fixing means      becoming dislodged and passing through the washer, or as a result of the      fixing means being torn away through the profiled steel sheet. The values      of the rupture are relatively homogeneous, of the order of 900 to 1300N. </PAR><PAR>  The large number of fixing means makes implementation lengthy and      expensive. Furthermore, the performance of the cladding is considerably      diminished at the level of the fixing means because the cladding is      partially pierced, or because it can be punched by the head of the fixing      means passing through the washer, or alternatively torn at the periphery      of the washer when the latter is locked, redundantly, on the rod of the,      fixing means, as described in French Patent 1,522,378. Such phenomenon      favors the breaking of the weld between the bolt and the profiled steel      sheet. These disadvantages are considerably amplified when the insulating      panels are compressible but elastic. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The object of the present invention is to provide a covering which is      simpler and quicker to implement than the conventional openings covering      and, moreover, which has an improved resistance to wind. </PAR><PAR>  To this end, the invention provides a leaktight covering, in particular for      an industrial building, comprising a loadbearing element adapted to be      fixed to a framework element of the building, a layer of an insulating      material arranged on the loadbearing element, and a cladding covering the      layer of insulating material, connection means being provided in order to      maintain such three components assembled together. The connection means      comprise a first fixing member fixing the loadbearing element to the      framework and comprising, above the loadbearing element, an extension      piece of a length substantially equal to the thickness of the insulating      layer and a flexible plate and a second fixing member bearing on such      flexible plate via a widened head and/or a rigid washer and fixed to the      extension piece. The dimension of the widened head or of the rigid washer      is between the maximum dimension of the first or the second member in the      vicinity of the outer surface of the layer of insulating material and the      dimension of the flexible plate. The cladding is fixed only to the      flexible plates. </PAR><PAR>  In this manner, the cladding which will be fixed to a number of flexible      plates will be fastened firmly to the framework moreover, the invention      also makes it possible to fasten the loadbearing element firmly to the      framework in such a way that all the suction forces to which the covering      is subjected will be transmitted to the framework element, purlin or beam. </PAR><PAR>  This high-performance device permits the use of at most one fixing means      per m.sup.2 of covering (or even one per 2 m.sup.2), thus dividing the      total number of fixing means by more than five as compared with the      conventional techniques described above. </PAR><PAR>  In the case of a steel framework, the above-mentioned screw can be a      self-tapping screw. In the case of a concrete framework, the      abovementioned screw is engaged in a metal insert of the framework element     . </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from      the description which follows of illustrative embodiments of the      invention, made with reference to the attached drawings, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic sectional representation of a first embodiment of      the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic sectional representation of a second embodiment of      the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a view in section along a framework element and corresponds to      the embodiment in FIG. 2; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4 and 5 are sectional views illustrating a particular embodiment of      the invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  A framework element can be seen in FIGS. 1 and 2 would consists of a steel      joist 1 constituting a purlin of a framework. A loadbearing element 2      consisting of a profiled steel sheet is arranged transversely on purlins      1. </PAR><PAR>  An insulating layer 3 consisting, for example, of plates of insulating      material is placed on the load-bearing element 2. The covering or roofing      is completed by a cladding 10 which is placed on the outer face of the      insulating layer 3. </PAR><PAR>  A fixing device according to the invention comprises a first fixed member      comprising a screw 4 which is fixed to the purlin 1 with interposition of      the support element 2 which is therefore in this way firmly fastened to      the framework. </PAR><PAR>  This first member serves firstly to fix the loadbearing element 2 to the      framework purlin 1, and also constitutes an element forming part of a      connection means for the three components of the covering, namely the      loadbearing element 2, the insulating layer 3 and the cladding 10. </PAR><PAR>  The screw 4 is advantageously a self-tapping screw. In the case of a      concrete framework, screw 4 engages in a metal insert of the framework      element. </PAR><PAR>  A head 5 of the screw 4 has an extension piece aligned with the shaft of      the screw and arranged on the opposite side of the head 5. In the first      embodiment of FIG. 1, this extension piece consists of an internally      threaded, hollow, cylindrical intermediate piece 6 which is open at its      free end and a bottom 20 of which is fixed to the loadbearing element via      the screw 4. In the embodiment in FIG. 2, the extension piece consists of      a threaded rod 7. The length of the cylinder 6 or of the rod 7 is      substantially equal to the sum of the thicknesses of the insulating layer      3 and of the loadbearing element 2. </PAR><PAR>  A second member comprising a part including a rigid washer is fastened      firmly to the abovementioned first member. In the case of FIG. 1, this      second member is a screw 8 which engages in the cylinder 6, which has a      milled flat head and on which is engaged a rigid washer 9 of diameter and      forming a rigid distribution element. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment in FIG. 2, the second member consists of a sort of plug      11 which has an internally threaded tubular part 12 which interacts with      the rod 7 and which is surmounted by a rigid flat head 13 constituting a      bearing washer or rigid distribution element similar to the rigid washer      9. </PAR><PAR>  Lastly, the fixing device comprises a flexible plate 21 which is placed      between the rigid washer 9 or the rigid flat head 13 and the insulating      panels 3. Plate 21 is preferably circular, of diameter D and of large      dimensions. </PAR><PAR>  Flexible plate 21 is, for example, made from a metal of small thickness and      can comprise a surface coating compatible with the material constituting      the cladding. It is also possible to use a material comprising a      reinforcement which is woven or nonwoven, made from glass, polyester,      organic material or from a mixture of these components, in which case the      plate is coated with a material identical to or compatible with that of      the cladding. </PAR><PAR>  The abovementioned plate 21 can advantageously be fastened beforehand      firmly to the washer 9 or to the rigid head 13 by adhesive bonding or      welding. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment in FIG. 1 comprising a first member consisting of a      screw, it is also possible to provide for the flexible plate to be crimped      between two rigid washers corresponding to the washer 9. </PAR><PAR>  The rigid washer 9 or the flat head 13 can have a diameter a of the order      of 80 mm. </PAR><PAR>  The flexible plate 21 must have a mechanical strength under tension which      conforms with the equation R.sub.t .pi.aandgt;5000N and preferably of the order      of 8000N, the mechanical strength under tension R.sub.t being expressed in      Newtons per cm width and measured in accordance with the standard NF      G07--001. Plate 21 must also have a tear strength Rd (measured in      accordance with the UEATC method 5.4.1., July 1982) which is at least      equal to 200N and preferably of the order of 400N. To this end, the      diameter d of the cylindrical piece 6 in the embodiment in FIG. 1, or of      the second member 11 in the embodiment in FIG. 2, in the vicinity of the      outer surface of the layer 3 of insulating material, must be not less than      6 mm and preferably of the order of 10 mm. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, the difference between the diameter D of the plate 21 and the      diameter a of the rigid washer 9 or of the flat head 13 must be at least      equal to 100 mm and preferably of the order of 170 mm. As a result, it is      possible to use, for example, a flexible plate whose diameter D is of the      order of 250 mm. </PAR><PAR>  The diameter of the washer or rigid head a and the diameter d of the fixing      element are advantageously selected in such a way that the difference      (a-d) is approximately equal to 90 mm and in any case greater than 70 mm.      This makes it possible to prevent the flexible plate 21 from allowing the      rigid piece 9 or 13 to &quot;escape&quot; by slipping, tearing or becoming      dislodged. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a view in section perpendicular to FIG. 2 and shows the method of      fixing the loadbearing element 2 to the purlin 1. It can be seen that the      rod 7 is integrally connected to the head of the self-tapping screw 4      which is fixed in a recess of the profiled sheet 2 on the purlin 1 with      the interposition of a washer 14. </PAR><PAR>  The fixing device according to the invention advantageously comprises at      least one thermally insulating element in order to prevent the formation      of thermal bridges. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4 and 5 show an alternative embodiment of the invention. This is      intended in particular for edge purlins 41 which are directly adjacent to      an acroterium or ornamental summit 42. </PAR><PAR>  In this case, the axis of the fixing point of the cladding is offset      relative to the axis of fixing of the loadbearing element to the purlin.      To this end, the first member consists of two screws 51 and 52 arranged      symmetrically relative to the axis of a purlin 41 which constitutes the      axis of fixing of a profiled sheet 44 to the purlin 41. </PAR><PAR>  Screws 51, 52 serve to fix one end of a base 43 to the purlin 41. Base 43      preferably has, in cross-section (FIG. 5), the shape of a U and carries,      at one of its ends, a hollow cylindrical member 45 similar to the      cylindrical piece 6 in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  It can be seen that the axis of the hollow member 45 is offset relative to      the axis of the purlin 41. It is, of course, possible to provide a similar      arrangement in which the base 43 supports a rod similar to the rod 7 in      FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  A covering in accordance with the present invention can be realized as      follows. Firstly, the loadbearing element 2, 44 (profiled sheet) is fixed      to the beams or purlins 1, 41 of the framework by means of the fixed      members 4 or 51, 52. The panels of the insulating layer 3, 46 are      positioned by &quot;impaling&quot; them on the extension pieces 6 and 7 respectively      of the first members. The flexible plates are positioned where they are      not firmly fastened to the rigid washers, and then the fixing of the      second members 8, 11 to the first members is carried out so as to fasten      the second members firmly to the loadbearing element and the purlin or      beam. Then the cladding is positioned and is fixed by welding or adhesive      bonding to the flexible plate and the rigid washer of the devices      according to the invention. </PAR><PAR>  The various mechanical elements (self-tapping screw, first member, second      member) are dimensioned so as to have a tear strength of the order of      5000N. In this way a homogeneous assembly is obtained which has a tear      strength of 5000N, and all of the forces resulting from a suction exerted      on the cladding are transmitted directly to the framework by the fixing      members. </PAR><PAR>  Since the number of fixing means per m.sup.2 is very considerably reduced,      the cost and the time taken to install a covering are considerably      reduced, which makes it possible to construct coverings with large surface      areas, in particular coverings for industrial buildings. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, in the event of people moving about on the covering or of      compressive loads, the cladding follows the movements of the flexible      plate and cannot therefore be torn at the level of the periphery of the      rigid washer. Highly compressible insulators can be used for the      insulating layer, which makes it possible to reduce further the cost and      this is particularly so in the case where the flexible plate is crimped      between two rigid washers. </PAR><PAR>  It is possible, for example, to use mineral wool having a density of less      than 120 kg/m.sup.3 and preferably equal to 100 kg/m.sup.3 instead of      mineral wool of a density of 150 kg/m.sup.3 which is currently used. </PAR><PAR>  It is also possible to use glass wool with a density of less than 90      kg/m.sup.3 instead and in place of a glass wool of a density of 110      kg/m.sup.3. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
