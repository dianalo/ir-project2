The liabilities weren't disclosed.    Adler andamp; Shaykin, a New York-based investment firm that specializes in leveraged buyouts, began a tender offer late last month for about 94% of Joy's common shares outstanding. The tender offer is designed to take Joy private. Cooper, a maker of tools and compression and drilling equipment, said the acquisition of the Joy units is conditioned on Adler andamp; Shaykin gaining control of Pittsburgh-based Joy, a maker of mining equipment.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    Cooper said the units it is acquiring had combined sales of $152.3 million in 1986. Cooper said the Joy units will be integrated into Cooper's Compression andamp; Drilling Products business segment.    Separately, Cooper said it acquired 90% of the shares of H.K. Porter Inc., a Somerville, Mass.-based maker of hand tools, in a previously announced $7.4 million tender offer that expired last Wednesday. </TEXT></DOC>
