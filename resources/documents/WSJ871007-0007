The State Department sought $488 million for fiscal 1988, the second year in a $2.1 billion, five-year effort to rectify structural and security deficiencies at embassies. Congress is still working on a final budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, but because of spending constraints, the State Department only expects to get $61 million, or less than 13%, of its request. Says Richard N. Dertadian, deputy assistant secretary of state for foreign buildings: &quot;The money just ain't there.&quot;    That's disappointing news for a number of U.S. construction, engineering and architectural concerns, some of which count embassy contracts among their largest jobs. Security Source One Ltd., an electronics concern, for example, says it won its biggest job ever through the renovation program last year, a $10 million contract to install, among other things, closed-circuit television systems in the Honduran and Guatemalan embassies. Svedrup Corp., a St. Louis engineering concern, got what had been one of the most sought-after jobs: a consulting contract potentially worth several hundred million dollars to advise the department on engineering and security on an embassy by embassy basis. The contract, which Svedrup calls one of its most significant in recent years, enabled the company to hire more than 100 new employees.    ALL TOLD, CONTRACTS totaling $220 million were awarded to American companies under the embassy upgrading program in fiscal 1987. U.S. companies are guaranteed most of the work. For example, if at least two American companies submit a bid for an embassy project, the job must go to a U.S. company even if a foreign concern submits a lower bid.    A year before the program started, the State Department spent $440 million in an effort to secure embassies against increasing incidents of terrorism and espionage. The $629 million spent in the last two fiscal years dwarfs spending on embassy facelifts in any previous two years.    But that kind of money is harder to get these days. Though State Department officials can't predict the renovation program's future funding levels, they say that under current budget constraints, new embassy construction likely will be scuttled this year in Ecuador, Morocco, Thailand, Turkey and Hungary.    The new embassy building in Moscow is another matter. Work on the $67 million, eight-story structure was halted earlier this year because security was breached by Soviet workers who installed eavesdropping devices in the building's frame. The State Department's Mr. Dertadian says no decision has been made about what to do with the unfinished building -- whether to raze it or do over some of the upper floors. He says it will take about a year of analysis before the department decides what to do.    IS THE U.S. PRODUCING a generation of &quot;disposable&quot; buildings, prone to problems that range from fast-deteriorating exteriors to massive leaks that force major renovations of even the newest structures? Some engineers think so.    Disposable buildings &quot;are an epidemic across the country,&quot; says Thomas A. Schwartz, a senior associate with Simpson Gumpertz andamp; Heger Inc., consulting engineers in Arlington, Mass.    Some recent examples: The five-year-old Pinellas County Courthouse in Clearwater, Fla., required $1.2 million in repair work earlier this year after rain continually leaked through the roof and between the walls. In Boston, the granite veneer of the 28 State Street high rise had to be secured with bolts bored into the backup concrete because the granite panels were becoming loose.    Less-durable materials are responsible for many of the complaints about newer buildings. The stone surfaces that cover many buildings are now typically 1 1/4-inches thick, compared with surfaces of up to a foot thick in buildings put up prior to 1960. Faulty design also plagues new structures.    Harvard University's Graduate School of Design, for one, is addressing the issue. A couple of years ago, the school became one of the few in the country to offer a course on how to identify and correct potential structural or design failures.    THE INVESTIGATION into last April's building collapse in Bridgeport, Conn., which killed 23 people, is about finished. An Occupational Safety and Health Administration spokesman says agency officials are studying a lengthy report by federal inspectors on the construction accident; an announcement on OSHA's findings could be made as early as next week, the spokesman says. OSHA won't comment on which of the roughly 18 contractors involved in the project are likely to be cited for violating safety rules, but a source close to the investigation says &quot;many&quot; will be named.    WOOD FRONT DOORS are losing the war with metal and composite doors, says the National Wood Window and Door Association. The trade group says its competitors' share of the exterior door market in new buildings increased to 63% last year, compared with 43% in 1979. The non-wood doors provide better insulation, the group concedes. They also look so much like the real thing that earlier this year, a now-defunct remodeling magazine mistakenly used a photo of a woodlike fiberglass door in an article on wood doors. </TEXT></DOC>
