The defendants claim that the New York law firm, which isworking for thrift regulators on a contingency-fee basis, hasa conflict of interest because it was extensively involved inthe junk-bond transactions that are at the heart of theregulators' allegations of fraud.</LP><TEXT>   In the Columbia lawsuit filed by Cravath in federal courtin Los Angeles last December, government regulators accusedMr. Milken and other former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.officials of rigging junk-bond transactions. The lawsuit,which seeks damages of $6 billion, accuses the defendants ofdefrauding Columbia, Beverly Hills, Calif., which failed andwas taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   In court filings seeking to disqualify Cravath, attorneysfor the defendants said, &quot;Cravath itself was retained by andrepresented Drexel in a number of the very transactionsinvolved in this suit and played a major role in the creationand perpetuation of the high-yield securities market nowunder attack.&quot;   Thomas Barr, a Cravath partner representing the FDIC, saidthat the firm's current work for the FDIC posed no conflictwith its previous work for underwriters or issuers ofhigh-yield junk bonds. &quot;This is purely a public-relationsploy,&quot; he said of the defendants' charges. &quot;This is as phonyas a three-dollar bill.&quot;   David Boies, another Cravath partner working on the case,said, &quot;Everybody who has looked at this before has concludedthere is no conflict. The FDIC looked at it before we wereretained.&quot;   Disqualification of Cravath would deprive regulators oflawyers who have done substantial work on the case andrequire the government to start afresh with new counsel,possibly causing delays.   The disqualification motion claims that between 1984 and1990, the law firm acted as counsel to either the underwriteror issuer for $15 billion of junk-bond securities. Thelawsuit also said Cravath was involved in some junk-bondsecurities that have defaulted or sharply declined in value,causing unspecified losses at Columbia.   &quot;By pointing the finger at these defendants, Cravath wouldappear to be diverting attention from itself and its clients,attempting to avoid potential exposure for any lossessustained by Sandamp;Ls on account of `unsuitable' investments,&quot;the motion to disqualify said.   Alan Dershowitz, an attorney for Mr. Milken, said, &quot;Notonly was Cravath doing what it now claims in hindsight to bewrong, but virtually everybody -- accepting the guidance ofCravath because people listen to their lawyers -- regardedwhat is now being deemed wrong to be a perfectly legitimateform of activity.&quot;   Mr. Boies said that the Columbia lawsuit doesn't maintainthat junk-bond transactions were inherently bad, however. Hesaid that the suit alleges that &quot;Michael Milken and thepeople who worked with him engaged in fraud and marketmanipulation, and that there's no indication that otherclients Cravath worked with engaged in fraud or marketmanipulation.&quot;   Mr. Milken, former head of Drexel's junk-bond department,is serving a 10-year sentence for six trading-relatedfelonies to which he pleaded guilty last year. He and theother defendants have denied the wrongdoing alleged by thriftregulators.   ---   NEGLIGENCE AWARDS paid by New York City rise faster thanexpected.   The payments to claimants who sued the city rose to anestimated $182.8 million in the year ended June 30, up 6.5%from the previous year. New York City had budgeted only $174million to pay awards in personal injury, medical malpracticeand false arrest and assault cases. The 1991 payments werefirst reported in the New York Law Journal, a tradepublication.   In 1991, the city paid 28 awards of $1 million or more, 13more than in the previous year. Many of the biggest awardscame in medical malpractice cases.   Eugene Borenstein, first deputy chief of the cityCorporation Counsel's tort division, said New York is one ofthe few major cities that pays costly medical malpracticeawards, because unlike many cities, it runs its ownhospitals.   ---   JUSTICE O'CONNOR decries lack of legal assistance for thepoor.   U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connorcalled for lawyers to devote more of their time to legal workfor the poor. But, speaking at the annual meeting of theAmerican Bar Association in Atlanta, she said she did notsupport the notion of mandatory pro bono work.   Associate Justice O'Connor called required public-interestwork a &quot;recipe for malpractice,&quot; because lawyers who arecompelled to take on such work for the poor might not do itwholeheartedly. She added, &quot;It's only a matter of getting{lawyers} to donate some of their time.&quot;   In her speech, Associate Justice O'Connor noted that manypoor tenants are improperly evicted from their homes. &quot;Allover the country, people are being forced into the street forlack of a lawyer.&quot;   Justice O'Connor also said that many families lose theirwelfare benefits as a result of bureaucratic errors, and thatfew file appeals because they don't know their rights.   ---   GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ wins lawsuit over movie rights tohis novel.   The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected anindependent producer's claim to the film rights to Mr.Marquez's 1988 bestseller, &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera,&quot;ruling that the Nobel prizewinning author never agreed tosell the rights.   The court noted that Mr. Marquez, though he exchangedseveral letters with the would-be producer of the movie,never signed the document that was labeled a &quot;formalagreement&quot; -- and indeed, had objected to several of itsterms.   Certain &quot;essential elements&quot; of a movie contract also weremissing, wrote Judge Dorothy Nelson for the unanimousthree-judge panel. Various terms were spelled out, such asthe percentage of net profits, but &quot;two critical terms --where the film would be shot and who would direct it -- werenot in this agreement,&quot; the court wrote. The absence of theseterms indicated that no binding contract had been reached,according to the court.   The producer, Richard Roth, sued Mr. Marquez in federalcourt in Los Angeles in 1989, asking a judge to determine hisstatus with respect to the movie rights. The appeals courtaffirmed the lower court's decision that no contract had beenmade.   &quot;What this decision says is that, in a movie deal, as inany contract, all of the key terms have to be agreed upon. Inthis case, the parties had agreed only on price,&quot; said JayCohen, a New York lawyer for Mr. Marquez.   Maxwell Blecher, a Los Angeles attorney for Mr. Roth, wasout of the country and couldn't be reached for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
