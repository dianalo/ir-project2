The National Association of Securities Dealers islaunching an advertising blitz, seeking to give its Nasdaqautomated stock-quote system the same cachet as the stockexchanges that compete with it for listings. The ads arerunning in national business magazines and on television inthe New York area.</LP><TEXT>   Without exactly saying so, the NASD also wants toestablish a separate identity for itself now that the term&quot;over-the-counter&quot; has taken on seamy overtones in manyinvestors' minds because of pennystock frauds.   &quot;Nasdaq is a stock market, separate from the OTC,&quot; saysBrian Holland who, as senior vice president of marketing forNASD, is coordinating the new ad campaign.   &quot;They're really trying to make the Nasdaq stock marketdistinct from OTC,&quot; says Robert Flaherty, editor of the OTCReview, a magazine that covers the OTC market. Mr. Flahertywas recently turned down when he sought permission to changethe name of the magazine to Nasdaq Review. &quot;I think they'reafraid the name Nasdaq will get sullied,&quot; he said, referringto the board that controls the Nasdaq market and itscopyrighted name.   Companies must meet minimum networth and otherrequirements to be eligible for Nasdaq trading. Trading oftheir shares is monitored through a surveillance systemdesigned to detect fraud. No such surveillance system isavailable for non-Nasdaq stocks, which have involved morethan a few cases of fraud. Many non-Nasdaq stocks are knownas &quot;pink sheets&quot; stocks because their prices are listed onpink paper by the National Quotation Bureau.   New Yorkers watching the late news tonight will be amongthe first to see the latest of this month's ads by the NASD,the self-styled self-regulatory body for the OTC market. In a30-second commercial, they will see slow-motion images offrenzied, messy trading on a stock exchange as a voice asks:&quot;Is there a rational alternative to the traditional tradingfloor?&quot; Naturally, there is: &quot;Nasdaq. The stock market forthe next 100 years.&quot;   The ad budget is &quot;several million&quot; dollars. And the targetaudience? &quot;MEPS,&quot; says Mr. Holland, referring to &quot;managers,executives and professionals,&quot; the kind of people who watchthe news, business shows and golf tournaments. For example,New York area viewers of the Masters golf tournament saw aNasdaq ad April 8.   One goal of Nasdaq, the nation's second largest securitiesmarket, is to make itself as familiar to corporate Americaand the investing public as the New York Stock Exchange.Nasdaq is always striving to gain new companies and to keepits larger and higher-quality OTC companies from defecting tothe New York and American exchanges.   First, however, the public has to know what Nasdaq is. The50-year-old NASD both operates and polices the market for the4,264 companies that meet its standards. Yet Nasdaq is farfrom a household word. It stands for National Association ofSecurities Dealers Automated Quotations system.   &quot;It's not so much that the image is bad, it's just there'sno image at all,&quot; says Ron Berger, the advertising executivehired to start a television and magazine ad campaign earlierthis month by the NASD.   In surveys taken before the current ad campaign, a numberof people didn't realize that Apple Computer, MCICommunications and Intel trade on Nasdaq. A major NASD goal&quot;is to get chief executives to keep their listing on Nasdaqand gain a larger share of new listings,&quot; says Mr. Berger, apartner with Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer, a NewYork ad agency.   On Nasdaq, brokers compete to get the best share pricesfor their clients using telephones and an integrated systemof computer screens -- the 19-year-old Nasdaq network --rather than competing on an exchange floor. Over-the-counterstocks were generally traded through pink sheets until 1971,when computerized trading became available through Nasdaq.Thousands of companies are still confined to the pink sheets,where their prices and the brokerage companies that make amarket in the stocks are printed each trading day but aren'tavailable during intraday trading.   Although Nasdaq may not be the sexiest name to hit TVscreens, it has caught on overseas. Next year Japan willinitiate Jasdaq (Japan Securities Dealers AutomatedQuotations system), an automated version of that country'sover-the-counter market that is modeled after the Americansystem. And while the London Stock Exchange didn't imitatethe name, in 1986 it converted to a trading system alsomodeled after Nasdaq.   Two of Nasdaq's three television ads focus on the systemsadopted by the Japanese and British and suggest that theNasdaq system will be the standard of the future.   But some skeptics say that if NASD wants to erase anynegative connotations of the OTC market from the public'smind, it must eventually encourage every trading department,every mutual fund and every publication that now uses theterm OTC to also change their names.   &quot;OTC is in common use,&quot; says John L. Watson III, presidentof the Security Traders Association. &quot;It will be a long timebefore the word disappears, even if you work at it.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          The over-the-counter market sank again Friday, ending theweek 2.4% below where it started.   The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 3.21 Friday, or 0.75%, to425.79. OTC advancers trailed decliners, 764 to 1,138, on150.3 million shares, up from 145.6 million.   Richard H. Holden, a principal of Alex. Brown, saidvolatility in the over-the-counter market increased in recentweeks, leaving stocks vulnerable to disappointing news. Mr.Holden added that he expects the mood to persist next week.   Granite Construction, a road-building company, got a warmreception from Wall Street.
