Arrests reported Saturday morning included 103 in Philadelphiaand 40 in Romulus, Mich.   Terry McNitt, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia group, said morethan 100 people protested for 2{ hours by kneeling or sitting infront of the doors of the Northeast Women's Center.   Police said the 103 arrested were released and will be chargedlater. He said they probably will be cited for defiant trespass.   The center's acting administrator, Diane Straus, said the centerwas scheduled to perform more than 30 abortions Saturday. She saidseveral women decided to reschedule their appointments but no onecanceled, but McNitt said one woman left with an anti-abortioncounselor instead of going to her appointment.   In Michigan, about 400 protesters, some favoring abortion rightsand some opposed, descended on a clinic in the Detroit suburb ofRomulus.   The 40 persons arrested on trespassing charges were trying toblock the entrance to the Northland Family Planning Clinic, saidpolice Sgt. Dan Snyder. They were released and ordered to appear inDistrict Court by July 17. No assaults were reported, he said.   ``I believe we are here in the spirit of repentance to stopabortion,'' said Vickie Brown of Wixom, Mich. ``I will never usephysical force but will be here until justice prevails.''   Smaller protests were also reported in Des Moines, Iowa, andDurham, N.C., with seven arrests at each city by early afternoon.   In Des Moines, about two dozen protesters were still marching onthe sidewalk in front of the Planned Parenthood clinic Saturdayafternoon, and three police paddy wagons were on hand. The sevenpersons arrested earlier in the day were charged with disorderlyconduct.   In past protests at the site, the anti-abortion protesters havepurposely been arrested en masse after sitting down at thebuilding's entrance. But on Saturday, individual protesters werearrested as they approached women entering the building.   ``We're just trying to tell them that we've got families to helpthem save their baby,'' said abortion protester Dave Leach.   Abortion supporters gathered across the street from the clinic ina counter-protest and solicited pledges for contributions based onthe number of abortion opponents expected to be arrested. Thepro-choice demonstrators said they hoped to raise $1,000 for PlannedParenthood.   Seven persons were charged with trespassing in Durham, N.C., forsitting in front of the doors of a medical center. They werereleased on $100 bond a short time later. They were part of a groupof more than 50 abortion opponents who gathered to sing, picket andpray outside the center.   The Supreme Court was expected to issue a ruling Monday on aMissouri law that restricts abortion and defines life as beginningat conception, or hold over the entire case for new arguments duringthe 1989-90 term.</TEXT></DOC>
