On merchandise trade alone, the Netherlands posted a fourthquarter surplus of 2.96 billion guilders, up from 2.20 billion guilders a year earlier and 2.31 billion guilders in the third quarter.    The Finance Ministry's report confirmed an earlier announcement by the government that the current-account deficit for all of 1987 narrowed to about seven billion guilders from 12 billion guilders in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
