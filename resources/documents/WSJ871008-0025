The U.S. currency also was undercut by interest-rate increases in West Germany and rumors of a rise in the Japanese central bank's key rate. After major U.S. banks raised their prime lending rates half a point to 9 1/4% yesterday, speculation also heated up about a discount-rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board.    Rate increases overseas would tend to make dollar-denominated investments less attractive and decrease demand for the U.S. currency. Although the boost in U.S. prime rates provided some support for the dollar, traders expressed fears that higher U.S. rates will only constrain an already troubled economy and fail to help the currency.    &quot;If the economy isn't doing well and the interest rate goes up, that is only going to hurt the economy more,&quot; Yani M.A. Budiman, vice president, corporate foreign exchange, at Chemical Bank, New York, said.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 145.20 yen, compared with 146.78 late Tuesday. The dollar was down 0.5% against the West German currency at 1.8231 marks, compared with 1.8328.    The dollar was quoted at 145.10 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    The dollar's drop against the yen was anticipated earlier in the week by some dealers, as the dollar's value against the Japanese currency had been bolstered by speculative cross-trading between the yen and European currencies. Traders were creating &quot;cross&quot; positions by selling yen and buying dollars that they then sold for marks.    Many of these speculators reversed these positions yesterday, selling marks and buying dollars that they then sold for yen.    &quot;People were looking to take profits and go the other way on the cross,&quot; Leslie A. Puth, a corporate trader for Banque Indosuez in New York, said.    Profit-taking in mark-yen trading came as the West German currency climbed above 80 yen, a major resistance level on price charts used by traders and technical analysts. In late New York trading, the mark had slipped back to 79.64 yen.    Meanwhile, the West German Bundesbank raised another important interest rate, increasing its fee on one-month repurchase agreements to 3.75% from 3.65%. It was the third increase in this money market rate since late July and the second rise this week in rates set by that nation's central bank.    The Bank of Japan also is widely rumored to be considering raising its discount rate from 2.5%. A senior Bank of Japan official said in Tokyo that the recent rise in short-term rates in Japan wasn't engineered by the central bank.    In an interview with Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the official said the rise, particularly in the so-called unconditional call rate, was due to seasonal factors. But many economists and traders in the money and foreign exchange markets have come to believe that the Bank of Japan is tightening monetary policy to try to slow down inflation and money-supply growth.    Separately, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said in London that $1.64 is a &quot;very satisfactory rate&quot; for the British pound. The pound stood at $1.6438 in late New York trading yesterday, compared with $1.6335 a day earlier.    Mr. Lawson also underlined the importance of stable exchange rates in combating inflationary pressures. In a radio interview, he defended the plan for a managed float of major currencies that he presented last week at the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington.    A managed currency float, he said, is &quot;what we've been engaging in increasingly&quot; since the major industrialized countries agreed in September 1985, in the so-called Plaza accord, to push the dollar lower against other major currencies.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 90 cents an ounce to $458.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.3 million ounces.    ---              Late New York Trading              Wednesday, Oct. 7, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
