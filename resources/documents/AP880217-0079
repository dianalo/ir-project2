(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt,looking South after their one-two finish in New Hampshire'sDemocratic primary, said today that campaign themes should notchange with the region. Paul Simon said he would withdraw from therace unless he wins one of two contests next week.   ``People in the South aren't voting for a zip code. They'revoting for the president of the United States,'' Dukakis, theMassachusetts governor, said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''   Gephardt, appearing on the same program, characterized hissecond place finish in New Hampshire as a victory. ``The reason wewon,'' he said, ``is because we got off the plane last week andbegan saying the same thing in New Hampshire that we said in Iowa.''   Dukakis said the race still was ``wide open.'' Gephardt said ithad now come down to him and Dukakis.   Meanwhile, Simon, who came in third, said, ``I have to wineither in South Dakota or Minnesota. Otherwise I'm going to have towithdraw.''   Dukakis, the three-term governor of next-door Massachusetts, wonTuesday's primary with a strong 17-percentage point margin over theMissouri congressman. He was leaving today for the next majorbattleground, the South.   Even as he did, however, Dukakis acknowledged that his victorydidn't decide the race but drew the battle lines more clearly. ``Ithink it's going to go all the way to the last primary,'' he said.   Gephardt, whose victory in Iowa's caucuses eight days earlierwas largely overshadowed by the brawl on the Republican side,accomplished his chief aim _ finishing ahead of fellow MidwesternerSimon.   ``I love New Hampshire,'' Gephardt said.   ``It's a result that we needed here,'' Gephardt said. ``Itappears to be that we've got a Dukakis-Gephardt race in the rest ofthe country, but that could change.''   Dukakis won 37 percent of the vote and said the victory giveshim momentum heading into the delegate-rich primaries on March 8,when contests are set in every state of the South but one.   The Massachusetts governor won nearly as many votes as his nexttwo closest challengers combined, and he was leaving immediatelyfor the next round of campaigning in Atlanta and Florida.   ``Last week in Iowa our message started to shine through, and wewon a bronze,'' he said, a reference to his third-place finish inthat state's caucuses. ``Tonight here in New Hampshire, our messagecame through loud and clear. We went for the gold and we won it.''   Gephardt had 20 percent and Simon, the Illinois senator, had 17percent.   Jesse Jackson's 8 percent put him in fourth place, ahead ofTennessean Albert Gore Jr.'s 7 percent. Bruce Babbitt finished withjust 5 percent and headed for Washington to meet with advisers andwrestle with the question of whether to withdraw.   Finishing last with 4 percent was Gary Hart, the prohibitivefront-runner a year ago who saw his presidential hopes wrecked withembarrassing disclosures about his personal life.   When he re-entered the race in mid-December, Hart said, ``letthe people decide,'' and in New Hampshire their decision wasn't theone he wanted. He said it would take 30 to 60 days ``to determineif I can put together a viable candidacy,'' and suggested he mayscale back the scope of his effort.   ``It's a disappointing showing but we're not discouraged,'' Hartsaid.   Gephardt was leaving New Hampshire before dawn for stops inSouth Dakota and Wyoming, both of which have contests in the nextthree weeks.   Gephardt was betting on gaining a boost in South Dakota andplanned to be in that small state six out of the next seven days _even though its primary next Tuesday is a beauty contest wherevoters express a preference but don't award nominating delegates.   He came into New Hampshire saddled with debt, as was Simon. Bothface the prospect of a three-week campaign where the costs ofbuying television airtime across the South are enormous, and wherethey may be forced to select states to contest while bypassingothers.   ``We're not badly in debt,'' Gephardt said. ``We're in goodshape. Money is coming in.''   Gore's fifth-place finish wasn't good enough to give him anyboost going into the South, as he had hoped. Gore spent a lot ofmoney in New Hampshire but not a lot of time, and he departed thestate for much of the final week while his competitors dominatedthe airwaves.   Simon was heading to Minnesota, which like South Dakota has itscontest next Tuesday and where he must do well to stay in the race.   Simon had predicted he would beat Gephardt and challenge Dukakisin New Hampshire, but he insisted ``we're moving on.''   Jackson and Gore, both of whom have an enormous stake in theSuper Tuesday primaries across the South, were campaigning theretoday. Jackson was heading to Florida and Gore watched the returnsfrom Texas.   All the candidates were converging on Texas, where the first ofa series of Southern debates is set for Thursday night in Dallas.The Republicans debate there on Friday.   Although the first primary of the 1988 campaign was likely towinnow the field, none of the losers displayed a willingness toleave the race right away. The most likely candidate appeared to beBabbitt, and Jackson said he talked with Babbitt about gaining anendorsement if the former Arizona governor quits the race.   ``No way,'' Babbitt insisted when asked if he would withdraw.But he said he planned meetings with supporters to ask, ``Should Iwage a guerrilla campaign or should I withdraw and do somethingelse?''   Although far more was at stake in New Hampshire, 18 nominatingdelegates were awarded by the primary results. Dukakis collected 9,Gephardt 6 and Simon 3.   The rest got none.</TEXT></DOC>
