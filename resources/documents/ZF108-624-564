(products).andO;Product:   Office Works 2.0 (Office automation software) (usage)Higgins 2.32 (Office automation software) (usage).andO;Topic:     Software packagesWork group computingUser Ratings.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Buyers Praise Ease of Use, Speed And Flexibility of Both PackagesandM;Office Works 2.0's and higgins 2.32's E-mail and scheduling capabilities,among other features, make office operations run more efficiently, accordingto buyers of these products.andP;  The two groupware packages could both beimproved, however, buyers said.andM;Using Data Access Corp.'s Office Works has speeded up communication in adeadline-oriented environment, according to Pat Pasco, a television broadcasttraffic manager for the U.S.andP;  Information Agency in Washington.andP;  &quot;Speed iscritical--every time we schedule a broadcast transmission, our units have tobe notified what part of the world it goes to and on which circuits,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;Before Office Works, everything had to be printed out anddistributed--now all we have to do is enter it in E-mail and forget it.&quot;andM;Office Works users at Miami-Dade Community College, in Miami, found theprogram very easy to learn and use, said Charles Howse, chief engineer at thecollege.andP;  &quot;The most common statement is, 'Is that all there is?andP;  Isn't itmore difficult?'&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;[Users need to] know a couple of keys and that'sit.&quot;andM;Buyers of Enable Software Inc.'s Higgins were also pleased with thatproduct's ability to provide information quickly.andM;&quot;If I'm heading out on a client visit, with a single command I can print allcommunications history with that client,&quot; said Ron Peri, president ofComputer Support of North America Inc., a LAN systems integrator in BaskingRidge, N.J.andP;  &quot;We're impressed with the relational aspects of the product.andO;You can recall data and combine information very fast.&quot;andM;&quot;[Higgins] has improved productivity dramatically--it's improvedcommunication, projects move faster, [and] decisions are made faster,&quot; said aHiggins buyer at a consumer products company who asked to remain anonymous.andO;&quot;It facilitates scheduling, [and] it has decreased the clerical staff's workload.&quot;andM;While both products offer scheduling features, they differ in functionality,according to buyers.andM;&quot;With Office Works, you can set your schedule for the day, week, month or thenext six months very quickly,&quot; said Jerry Busick, president of Data ModesInc., a software developer located in Oklahoma City, Okla.andP;  &quot;Once everyone'sschedules are on the system, quickly arranging group meetings is a realasset.&quot;andM;&quot;I'm happy [with Office Works scheduling feature], but would be happier witha TSR kernel allowing calendar alarm capabilities to alert you 10 to 15minutes before an appointment,&quot; said Pasco.andM;For Howse, the capability to designate an alternate scheduler with OfficeWorks is an advantage.andP;  &quot;If someone goes on vacation, they can name analternate not only to schedule appointments, but to check and respond tomail, as well as send out documents,&quot; he noted.andM;Higgins' scheduling feature seems ideal for large companies, according toSteve O'Keefe, a network manager at Texas Commerce Bank in Houston.andP;  &quot;Thewide area scheduling allows the user to check and set schedules for users onmultiple servers,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Our secretaries can schedule meetings for bigshots on different floors.&quot;andM;&quot;[With Higgins], to schedule meetings times and rooms, you can inquirypeople's schedules to come up with the first possible time slot,&quot; said Periat Computer Support.andP;  &quot;Once you've got a slot, it will automatically generatemessages to all attendees, send a cover memo describing the agenda, andattach all necessary documents.&quot;andM;Buyers also praised Office Works' ability to task-swap quickly vi a hot key.andO;&quot;With Office Works 2.0's hot-key capability, you can read a message directlyand go right back to what you were doing,&quot; Howse said.andP;  &quot;If you're working ona spreadsheet and wish to discuss it in an E-mail memo, you can bounce backand forth.&quot;andM;&quot;The ability to hot key is very helpful,&quot; agreed Busick.andP;  &quot;Previously, ourreceptionist had two workstations, one for relaying phone messages, the otherfor word processing.andP;  With Office Works, we've moved her to a singleworkstation.andP;  Now she can go from one task to another very quickly.&quot;andM;Although Higgins currently does not have hot-key, task-swapping capability,Higgins buyers interviewed by PC Week said they were looking forward to aversion of the package that will include the ability to task-switch with ahot key between their normal applications and Higgins.andP;  This feature will beincluded in the next version of Higgins, said Enable Software officials (seestory, Page 78).andM;Higgins buyers found its fax capabilities and its other gateways useful.andP;  Itsgreat tp be able to send a fax right from your desk--saving you from printingout your document and carrying it to the fax machine,&quot; said Peri.andP;  &quot;Inaddition [to the fax gateway], there are [other] gateways, which areexceptionally good for multilocation networks.&quot;andM;For Texas Commerce Bank's O'Keefe, Higgins' fax capabilities allow forcommunications between different branches of the bank.andM;&quot;We've got 15 member banks across the state,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We can sendinvestment information to all the senior trust officers through the faxgateway.&quot;andM;According to Steve Dickson, a message network analyst for U.S.andP;  West, atelephone company in Denver, not only does the Higgins fax feature performwell, it is cost efficient.andP;  &quot;It doesn't degrade the mail server performance.andO;As soon as it receive an outbound queue, the task is passed off to thecoprocessor,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Certainly the price [of the $995 Higgins To-FAXpackage] is well worth the ability to have a fax gateway.&quot;andM;Office Works 2.0 buyers interviwed by PC Week had not tested the product'sfax capabilities, as the product was just released in April, they said.andM;Accordingly to buyers of both products, the user has the option of making allinformation either public or private access.andM;&quot;Office Works ties in with the Novell security system,&quot; and Howse.andP;  &quot;When youcreate a menu, you can password-control who may traverse it.andP;  It gives youenough control over the casual snooper.&quot;andM;&quot;One reason the government uses Higgins is the passwords are encypted--you'vegot two levels of protection,&quot; explained Peri.andM;Buyers of both products, although pleased overall with their purchasedecisions, mentioned some areas the could be improved.andM;&quot;Right now, Higgins' client/server clients can be OS/2 or DOS, but I'd liketo see a Macintosh user agent,&quot; said Dickson.andM;Added Peri: &quot;A big improvement for Higgins would be a pop-up TSR to run undera memory-resident program.&quot;andM;According to the buyer at the consumer products company, it would be usefulif users could view a document within Higgins instead of having to file itfirst.andM;She added, &quot;It would be helpful to be able to route things for review orapproval in a particular sequence, specifying which users see [something]first.&quot;andM;Although PC Week found Higgins' documentation to be generally good, one buyerdid not.andM;&quot;The area in which it really falls short is technical documentation, what thesystem administrator needs to know.andP;  It is much more primitive than theproduct itself,&quot; said the buyer, who requested anonymity.andP;  &quot;Also, thereference guide is not clearly written, so we wrote our own, for the mailfacility, for employees.&quot;andM;Office Works could also be improved, said Pasco.andP;  &quot;In addition to a calendaralarm, the package needs a calculator and the capacity to run on a 24-hourmilitary clock.&quot;andM;Also, he said, &quot;I have seen better documentation, but Office Work's isadequate.andP;  There were some nuances that were buried that should have beenhighlighted.&quot;andM;Office works could use a more complete phone messaging system, according toBusick.andM;&quot;An automatic recall system would help, so that you wouldn't have to ask aperson their number every time they called--you could just punch it up,&quot;
