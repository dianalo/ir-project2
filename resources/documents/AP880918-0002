Police said the driver of the MG Midget car was killed but therewere no other casualties.   A spokesman for the Defense Ministry said there was no danger tothe public but he would neither confirm nor deny claims a truckleading the convoy was carrying nuclear depth bombs.   The accident occurred near Ilminster in County Somerset when thecar struck a bus and then crashed head-on into the huge transportertruck, according to police. They said the truck was slightlydamaged.   Members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said theytrailed the convoy, which they claimed included four warheadtransporters, from the time it left the Burghfield nuclear assemblyfacility near Reading, 35 miles west of London, earlier Saturday.   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said withoutattribution that the convoy was transporting four nuclear depthbombs to the Royal Navy's armament depot in Plymouth on the southcoast.   Depth bombs are designed for use aircraft to attack submarines.   Colin Hines, a spokesman for the environmentalist groupGreenpeace, said Saturday's accident and another convoy accident inJanuary 1987 were ``a virtually inevitable consequence of thetrundling around Britain of not only 128 Polaris missiles, but alsothe little-known 140 naval nuclear depth bombs and 50 naval nuclearfree-fall bombs.   ``It's time for this nuclear transport to stop and for Britain'snaval nuclear weapons to be put upon the disarmament agenda,'' hesaid.   A spokesman for the Avon and Somerset police said the area wasnot evacuated.   ``We have special contingency plans for situations where anaccident occurs involving a sensitive load. They were not put intooperation in this case,'' he said. He was not indentified inkeeping with British practice.   The Defense spokesman, also speaking anonymously, called thecollision ``a very minor incident.''   On Jan. 10, 1987, a 20-ton truck, part of a top-secret militaryconvoy, skidded off an icy country road near Salisbury in westernEngland. A large area was sealed off while the military spent 18hours righting the vehicle.</TEXT></DOC>
