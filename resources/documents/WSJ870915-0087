Shares firmed in London and Frankfurt and were steady in Singapore, mixed in Sydney and lower in Hong Kong.    The Nikkei stock average, which gained 33.03 Friday, rose 125.75 to 24954.02. The Tokyo Stock Exchange first section index rose 13.08, or 0.64%, to 2065.57. Volume was 730 million shares, compared with 850 million Friday.    Traders said Friday's announcement on the U.S. trade deficit, which widened from $15.71 billion in June, had a strangely lulling effect on Japanese investors, who had feared a figure near $20 billion.    &quot;It's looking good for Japanese exporters,&quot; one said, and attention has turned to the U.S. trade bill scheduled for congressional action this fall.    Last week, Tokyo analysts said that any U.S. trade deficit wider than $16 billion could cause an outbreak of bearishness in the market. However, the rumors of a $20 billion gap appeared to have blunted the effect of the actual figure.    Among export-led electrical and computer shares, Kyocera rose 170 to 6,500 yen ($45.20) a share, Sony rose 100 to 5,070, and NEC rose 50 to 2,140. Car manufacturers also gained. Toyota Motor was up 90 to 2,050, Honda Motor advanced 20 to 1,580, Isuzu Motors rose 19 to 434, and Nissan Motor rose 8 to 759.    Some pharmaceutical shares closed higher on bargain-hunting. Dai-Ichi Seiyaku rose 30 to 3,470, Chugai gained 20 to 1,920, and Banyu rose 10 to 1,750.    Many telecommunications-related issues also traded bullishly on continuing speculation about the second issue of 1,950,000 Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone shares due late this year. Kokusai Denshin Denwa gained 300 to 32,000, and Japan Aviation, a maker of airborne communications devices, rose 30 to 1,470. NTT was unchanged at 2,740,000 yen a share.    London shares posted moderate gains but closed below their highs as institutional investors showed only limited interest.    The 100-share index closed 10.6 points higher at 2271.8. The Financial Times 30-share index rose 11.6 to 1775.4. The gold mines index fell 3.5 to 449.5. Volume was light at 454.6 million shares, compared with 751.4 million Friday.    Prices rose steadily through the morning, bolstered by gains in New York Friday and in Tokyo earlier yesterday and expectations of further positive corporate earnings reports this week. But a lack of active institutional buying helped bring the market off its highs. Many dealers said investors are cautious with British unemployment and average earnings figures due Thursday and money supply data coming out Friday.    Economic indicators released yesterday had little impact. The government said that retail sales rose 0.5% in August from July and that prices of finished goods rose 0.3% in August while prices of raw materials rose 0.5%.    Consolidated Gold Fields rose 15 pence to 1,510 pence ($24.83) a share. The company is expected to report pretax profit today of #235 million to #240 million for the year ended June 30, compared with #111 million a year earlier.    Cable andamp; Wireless fell 16 to 439. The company said Li Ka-Shing, chairman of the Hong Kong-based property concern Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., acquired a 4.9% stake as a long-term investment. British rules bar any foreign investor from holding more than 15% of Cable andamp; Wireless.    Midland Bank jumped 15 to 509. The company said it rejected a takeover approach from Saatchi andamp; Saatchi.    Frankfurt share prices rose strongly in quiet trading, boosted by the dollar's advance in European and Asian trading and a firmer bond market. Siemens, West Germany's largest electronics concern, jumped 20.50 to 666 marks ($368.87) a share. Its stock fell recently after the company predicted lower earnings this fiscal year, but many analysts still see it as an attractive long-term investment.    Daimler-Benz gained 15 to 1,115, and Deutsche Bank firmed 12 to 698.50.    Australian industrial shares were firmer as local interest rates eased further, but mining stocks slipped on the Sydney exchange after the gold price fell Friday in New York.    Interest rates have been declining and the Australian dollar rising ahead of today's government budget message, which is expected to show a substantial narrowing of the nation's budget deficit in the current fiscal year.    M.I.M. Holdings, one of Australia's biggest mining companies, rallied to close unchanged at 3.68 Australian dollars ($2.69) a share on volume of 3.1 million shares. New York-based Asarco said Friday it will sell 155.6 million M.I.M. shares outside the U.S., reducing its stake to 19%. Some analysts say the move could make M.I.M. more vulnerable to a takeover bid.    Hong Kong shares fell after trading was suspended in four companies controlled by Cheung Kong's Mr. Li. After the market closed, the financier announced rights issues totaling 10.3 billion Hong Kong dollars ($1.32 billion) by Cheung Kong and the three other companies. He said 3 billion dollars will be used to pay for the 4.9% stake in Cable andamp; Wireless.    Shares in Singapore were steady to slightly higher in listless trading described as listless. Market participants cited investor caution over a new settlement system introduced a week ago.    In Stockholm, strong liquidity and steady buying by Swedish institutions sent shares to new highs in heavy trading. The Stockholm market closed at a record for the sixth time in seven sessions.    Elsewhere, shares rose in Brussels and Amsterdam, were mixed in Paris and fell in Milan. The Zurich market was closed for a holiday.
