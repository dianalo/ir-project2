Today, Mr. Spies, 69 years old and retired, says: &quot;The Iron Curtain is still there. But there are holes in it -- holes of hope.&quot;    As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev heads to Washington for his summit conference with President Reagan next week, Mr. Spies and his neighbors view the Soviet leader as an impressive and formidable figure. &quot;He's breaking out of the mold of what we've all believed the Russian leaders were,&quot; says Teri Windisch, a 30-year-old mathematics teacher.    Such comments are strikingly reinforced by a new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. The poll, taken during and after Mr. Gorbachev's televised NBC interview this week, shows that 53% of Americans have a favorable opinion of him while 20% have an unfavorable opinion. Slightly more Americans, 59%, hold a favorable view of President Reagan -- but substantially more, 35%, regard him unfavorably.    That a Soviet leader could have a better positive-to-negative poll rating among Americans than Ronald Reagan does is something few would have thought possible even a year ago.    Those favorable opinions about Mr. Gorbachev, however, are leavened by continuing skepticism and distrust of the Soviets. By 62% to 17%, Americans still trust Mr. Reagan more than Mr. Gorbachev to reduce tensions between the two countries.    To expand upon and illuminate the national poll, political analyst Peter Hart brought together Mr. Spies, Ms. Windisch and 10 of their neighbors earlier this week to discuss Mr. Gorbachev and the summit conference for The Wall Street Journal. While the group is too small to be a scientific sample, the opinions of these Missourians echo the results of the national poll. &quot;In looking and talking about Gorbachev,&quot; says Mr. Hart, &quot;they see him as the Russians' Iacocca -- a master salesman.&quot;    By nearly 3 to 1, the poll shows, Americans favor the accord that the two leaders plan to sign on intermediate-range nuclear forces. Moreover, Republicans support the accord just as strongly as Democrats do, even though four of the six GOP presidential candidates have attacked it.    And, like Mr. Spies, other Americans think relations between the two superpowers are more promising than they have been for some time: 41% of those surveyed now believe that relations with the Soviet Union will get better during the next year; in January, only 22% thought so.    But Americans aren't convinced that anything being done now will truly change the arms race, the Cold War or the basic antipathy between the communist East and the capitalist West. A plurality of those surveyed, 41%, don't think the accord will make much difference to the security of the U.S.; 38% think it will make the U.S. safer, while 13% think it will make the U.S. less safe. A plurality, 45%, still don't think the Soviets are becoming any less of a threat to world peace under Mr. Gorbachev, a finding consistent with earlier surveys.    &quot;The upcoming summit is punctuated more by a question mark than an exclamation point,&quot; concludes Mr. Hart, who organized and conducted the two-hour Fulton discussion. These Americans &quot;know the arms treaty will be signed, but they aren't sure what it will produce,&quot; says the pollster, a Democrat who isn't involved in the 1988 presidential race. &quot;There's no sense they're witnessing something of historic proportions. And while they know about the changes in the Soviet Union, they don't know if the changes are for real.&quot;    The Fulton discussion made clear that Americans view Mr. Gorbachev as a forceful player on the world stage. The participants in the discussion watched part of his televised interview and came away with their respect for his skills confirmed. &quot;He's a well-practiced politician, and he's going to say some of the right things,&quot; says Larry Nave, a 38-year-old campus police officer.    Despite their admiration for Mr. Gorbachev's political savvy, the Missourians show a deep-seated distrust of Soviet motives. While they like what they hear, they want to see it backed up with deeds, such as a withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan and greater respect for human rights within the Communist bloc.    &quot;I want to believe him because I think we have to try, but he scares me a little bit because he's so smooth,&quot; says John Hempe, 61, a salesman for the Jefferson City Credit Bureau. Sally Ann Antimi, a 40-year-old housewife and mother of four, agrees. The Soviet leader, she says, &quot;has lulled us into a sense of feeling better about him, but I don't think he can be trusted.&quot;    Their concerns are magnified by doubts about Mr. Reagan's negotiating ability, particularly when he is faced with such a formidable adversary. Pamela Fortune, a 25-year-old nurse who voted for Mr. Reagan in 1984, says that if she could be the president's summit coach, &quot;I'd tell him to sit down and get someone else&quot; to do the negotiating. Mrs. Antimi advises the president to &quot;stop and think before you open your mouth.&quot; Mr. Spies, the retired journalist, urges the president to &quot;be sure you follow your script. Don't talk off-the-cuff or ad-lib.&quot; And Ms. Windisch, the math teacher, advises Mr. Reagan, &quot;Keep your eyes open, stay on your toes and be aware.&quot;    But Robert Mansur, a 66-year-old former auditor who now is a doorkeeper for the state legislature, dismisses such concerns: &quot;I don't think Ron is going to give anything away to that 'evil empire.'&quot;    In the nationwide poll, 44% say that Mr. Reagan will do a better job of watching out for his own nation's interests at the summit conference, while 34% say Mr. Gorbachev will do better. Just under half of Americans think Mr. Reagan is better at helping his country prepare for the future and has a better understanding of international problems; about one in three Americans says Mr. Gorbachev is doing better on those fronts.    On the question about understanding international problems, the survey shows that the more educated Americans are, the less favorably they view the president. Fifty-seven percent of high-school graduates think Mr. Reagan has the better understanding of such problems -- but this view is shared by only 37% of college graduates and 23% of those with education beyond a bachelor's degree. By the same token, the percentage of those who think Mr. Gorbachev is the better informed rises from 24% of high-school graduates to 48% of those with postgraduate education.    The poll also showed that a surprisingly high 59% of Americans consider it either very or somewhat likely that the Soviet Union would honor an agreement with the U.S. to limit nuclear arms. Eighty-one percent say it is very or somewhat likely that the U.S. would honor a treaty.    In the Fulton discussion group, Mr. Spies looks forward to the agreement on intermediate-range nuclear forces &quot;as a beginning&quot; and adds: &quot;I don't see that we are giving up that much. I think it's important to make a beginning on negotiation.&quot; Even the most hawkish member of the group, Merlyn Bird, a 42-year-old corrections officer with a flat-top haircut, favors ratification. He doesn't believe the treaty will accomplish much but argues that rejection might &quot;send a message to the Soviet Union that there's no unity in our government.&quot;    Ronald Fee, 59, a retired maintenance supervisor, hopes that after the arms-limitation treaty is signed, &quot;further arms reductions are possible.&quot; But he also worries that &quot;we're getting the short end of the deal&quot; in the treaty, which he says could open the way for Soviet conventional forces to &quot;walk over Europe.&quot;    Some in the Missouri group believe that Mr. Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, or &quot;Star Wars,&quot; would make up for any ground lost with the arms-reduction treaty. &quot;That's where our strength is going to lie,&quot; says Mr. Nave, the campus policeman. The nationwide poll shows that only about half of Americans have heard or read enough about the system to have an opinion. Of those, proponents outnumber opponents by about 2 to 1.    More than two-thirds of Americans, the poll finds, believe that Mr. Gorbachev is sincere in trying to open up the Soviet economic and political system, and they by and large hope he succeeds. Sixty-two percent of the people in the nationwide poll agree with the statement that his success would be in the U.S. interest because it would make the Soviets less of a threat in the world, compared with a quarter of the respondents who said that such success would make the Soviets a stronger international adversary. Two-thirds of those surveyed favor agreements allowing more U.S. companies to do business with the Soviets.    In the Fulton group, Mr. Hempe, the credit-bureau salesman, hopes that Soviet democratization would divert funds away from military to domestic uses, but Mr. Fee worries that a Russia that is stronger economically would be a greater threat to the West. &quot;If you encourage the Russian people to think for themselves, you have a better state of readiness in the armed forces,&quot; he says. &quot;That would be a detriment to us.&quot;    Roberta Ramsay, a 40-year-old church volunteer, says enhanced trade between the superpowers &quot;might make peace a little more achievable.&quot; Mr. Mansur, the doorkeeper at the legislature, doesn't see how the U.S. can lose if trade is increased. &quot;We've got lots of things they can use,&quot; he observes, &quot;{but} what can they send us? They're not Japan, you know.&quot;    Most of these Midwesterners have had scant exposure to the Soviet Union, except for lingering impressions created by &quot;Dr. Zhivago,&quot; &quot;Rocky IV&quot; and news articles they have read over the years. When asked what the Soviet Union is like, most envisioned women in peasant scarfs, battling through snowdrifts, or Russian military parades with big red banners.    And the little personal experience they have had hasn't whetted their appetites for more. Mr. Hempe says that when his daughter spent 10 days there six months ago, &quot;her feeling was total confinement; she said they had a real sense of relief when they left.&quot;    ---   'In general, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of . . .'
