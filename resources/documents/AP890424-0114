Authorities took no open steps to interfere, but sources saidmore than 10,000 soldiers from outlying counties moved into Beijingover the weekend in preparation for an eventual crackdown.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thetroops had been used in the past to quash civil unrest. Somestudent leaders said they feared imminent arrest.   The exact number of participants in the boycott was not known,but students at a dozen schools with total enrollment of more than50,000 said virtually all their classmates were striking.   The boycott was the largest in 40 years of communist rule, eventhough there were no reports of students joining in other cities asthe student activists hoped.   ``Now is the time for all students in Beijing and nationwide tounited to fight for democracy!'' a student speaker at QinghuaUniversity yelled from a banner-strewn dormitory balcony to about1,500 wildly cheering listeners. He proclaimed the balcony a ``freespeech platform'' and invited orators with all views.   Students from several schools marched around campus and onnearby streets, gave speeches on street corners and plasteredcopies of the first edition of their own newspaper on lampposts andtrees to publicize their demands for press freedom, an end toofficial privileges and corruption, and respect for human rights.   The boycott marks a new phase in the campaign after a week inwhich the students, mourning the death of former reformist partychief Hu Yaobang, tried to confront the leadership directly. Theymarched repeatedly to central Beijing's Tiananmen Square and triedto storm Communist Party headquarters.   Top officials, who have begun market-style economic reforms butinsist China is not ready for democracy, refused to meet with them.   Student leaders stressed Monday they wanted their protest to bepeaceful and legal, and that they were not seeking to overthrow thegovernment or party.   However, many students said they want Premier Li Peng to resign,along with other officials they consider inept or too old. Severalposters even called for the complete retirement of senior leaderDeng Xiaoping, 84, who still wields power from behind the secnes.   ``We haven't really thought about who would take their places,''said an English student at Beijing Normal University.   Several posters attacked nepotism, listing the names ofrelatives of top leaders who have been given government jobs. Onereferred to Deng's son, head of the China Welfare Fund for thedisabled, as ``Prince'' Deng Pufang.   At Qinghua University, known as a training ground for China'stechnocrats, a school announcement carried over loudspeakers saidofficials opposed the boycott and wanted students ``to calm down.''It added: ``We want to make clear that the school has alwayscherished the students even though some are engaging in activitiesof which it does not approve.''   The state-run Xinhua News Agency sought to minimize the strike,saying: ``teaching and studying at most of the city's colleges anduniversities remained normal.'' It did not mention the reason forthe boycott.   However, the neighborhood in northwestern Beijing where thelargest universities are located was turned Monday into a hugedebating ground, with clusters of students distributing leafletsand earnestly telling passersby about police beatings of studentprotesters last week.   Efforts to enlist the support of workers, begun Sunday, werestepped up.   ``Workers, listen to us,'' shouted one philosophy student to acrowd of about 500 people. ``We are fighting for the rights of allChinese.''   At the People's University, one student put a tape player in hisdormitory window overlooking the street and played politicalspeeches made in recent days, including one criticizing Li Peng asinept. A crowd of nearly 1,000 people formed to listen, blockingtraffic.   About 1,000 students from the Beijing Foreign Languages Collegemarched from school to school to encourage fellow strikers. Morethan 1,200 students from the Central College of Minorities marchedto nearby People's University to read posters there.   Chen Mingyuan, a well-known researcher at the Chinese Academy ofSocial Sciences, spoke at Qinghua and Beijing universities toencourage the students.   ``Maybe there are some plainclothes police here,'' he told aQinghua crowd. ``If they are trying to take down the names of allof us, then their lot is hard indeed.'' The crowd roared withlaughter.   Most students said they planned to boycott classes until May 4,the 70th anniversary of China's first student movement. Thatcampaign also fought for democracy while galvanizing the entirenation in opposition to Japanese encroachments on Chinese soil.   But the current student movement also showed seriousorganizational weakness Monday when student leaders at BeijingUniversity began quarreling openly during a rally of about 5,000students. They disagreed on whether sit-ins and otherconfrontational tactics should be resumed.   There were no reports of new student activities in other citiesMonday. Foreign sources reported new looting Sunday night in thecentral city of Changsha in Hunan province, where young toughsmixed in with a student protest Saturday and went on a rampage.   Non-students also rioted after a student gathering Saturday inthe northwestern tourist city of Xian.</TEXT></DOC>
