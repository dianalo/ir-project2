(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of National Guardsmen patrolledravaged streets against looting today, and police reported more than90 arrests as residents returned to begin the long task ofrebuilding from Hurricane Hugo.   Chainsaws buzzed, crews worked around the clock to restore powerand telephone communications, and insurance agents across theCarolinas braced for claims that could run into the billions fromthe region's most devastating hurricane in 30 years.   ``It is the worst storm, the worst disaster, I've ever seenanywhere,'' Gov. Carroll Campbell said after surveying thedestruction by helicopter. ``We're going to be a long time diggingout of this and rebuilding.''   The hurricane was blamed for 18 deaths in the Carolinas and twoin Virginia.   In the six hours Hugo and its 135 mph winds surged through SouthCarolina, it flattened dozens of homes and buildings, snapped trees,twisted bridges and washed scores of boats ashore. Mayor Joseph P.Riley Jr. said damage in his 3-century-old city alone might reach $1billion.   ``There's just destruction everywhere,'' said Riley, who imposeda 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew.   Police reported isolated cases of looting. Fifty people werearrested in Mount Pleasant, across the Cooper River from Charleston;12 in North Charleston; and at least three in Charlotte, N.C. InCharleston, police Sgt. Thomas Gardner said today that 27 peoplewere arrested Friday and early today for looting and one forviolating curfew.   ``It was very quiet last night. I left at 1 a.m. and the onlything I saw were police cars and National Guardsmen,'' Gardner said.Two people from New Orleans, he said, were posing as relief workerswho then would take people's possessions; they had not been chargedyet.   The governor deployed 2,600 National Guardsmen to patrol streets,enforce the curfew, help remove debris, purify water and performother duties.   At a news conference today, Riley said power should be restoredby tonight at hospitals, but he could not estimate when residentsmight get power. Mail delivery could resume Monday, and herecommended that people boil water before drinking it.   Up to half a million customers across the state were withoutpower as of late Friday. In inland Columbia, people lined up at anice warehouse with coolers. Some areas of Charleston were withoutwater, and residents were told to boil their drinking water.   Two hundred miles inland, Charlotte, N.C., also sustained heavydamage, and nearly 80 percent of the customers in the city of375,000 were still without power this morning, said Duke Power Co.spokesman Joe Maher.   There were 14 deaths in South Carolina from the storm itself,related traffic accidents, and heart attacks suffered duringcleanup, according to the state Emergency Preparedness Division. InNorth Carolina, three deaths in the Charlotte area were blamed onthe storm, and a 6-month-old baby died in Union County when a treecrashed into a house.   Two people were killed by Hugo after it moved into Virginia as atropical storm. In the Caribbean, where Hugo first touched land, thestorm killed at least 27 people and left 50,000 homeless.   ``All things considered, we lucked out in a lot of ways,'' saidChipp Bailey, spokesman for Mecklenburg County Emergency Managementin Charlotte, where the most serious injury reported was a brokenpelvis suffered by a woman when a tree crashed through her roof.   The hurricane and its tidal waves of up to 17 feet smashed ashoreat Charleston late Thursday. After being downgraded to a tropicalstorm, Hugo advanced farther west than expected, whisking throughVirginia, West Virginia, Ohio and western Pennsylvania, where theNational Hurricane Center stopped tracking it.   By the time it reached Pittsburgh on Friday night, Hugo wasgenerating winds under 40 mph and was no longer classified as atropical storm. As it fizzled early today, Hugo's dying remnantsdarted through Canada's St. Lawrence Valley and became lost inanother weather front, according to meteorologist Joe Harrison ofthe National Weather Service in New York.   ``We really can't find it anymore,'' Harrison said.   President Bush declared seven South Carolina counties _ with atotal of 750,000 residents _ a disaster area. The declaration freesup federal aid for housing, loans and grants for rebuilding.   Hundreds of insurance adjusters have come to South Carolina toprocess the damage claims, but it will be days before they begin tocatch up, said state Insurance Commissioner John G. Richards.   Along the coast, Folly Beach, Isle of Palms, Pawley's Island,Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove and Garden City were devastated.   ``Garden City for all practical purposes is gone,'' said HorryCounty administrator M.L. Love after he toured the smallunincorporated town near Myrtle Beach. He said damage there couldrun in the hundreds of millions.   Residents of the Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island, which wereamong the hardest-hit barrier islands, were kept from eveninspecting their homes because the Ben Sawyer swing bridge _ theonly link to the mainland _ was knocked out. About 100 boats thathad been berthed at one marina were ``stacked up like cordwood,''said Ben Moise, a state Wildlife and Marine Resources Departmentofficial.   Pawley's Island had a 100-foot channel of water through it.   ``There are now two Pawley's Islands, if you will,'' pilot JackSellers said after flying over the island.   Although the Pentagon had dispatched planes and ships fromCharleston's Air Force and Naval bases as Hugo approached, theinstallations suffered perhaps $50 million in damage, said Sen.Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.   Charleston, a city of about 65,000 people, took the full force ofHugo.   Most of the historic antebellum mansions facing Charleston Harborweathered the storm, but Fort Sumter, the first Union strongholdfired upon by the Confederacy at the beginning of the Civil War,suffered $1 million damage when a 17-foot wall of water roared overit, federal officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
