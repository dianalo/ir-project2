But he said the Sandinistas will resumefighting if the peace talks fail.   ``We'll mobilize the entire nation,'' Borge said during awide-ranging interview Tuesday night that also touched uponlong-standing rumors of differences between him and PresidentDaniel Ortega.   Borge, one of nine commandants in the directorate of thegoverning Sandinista National Liberation Front, is regarded as oneof the most hawkish members of Ortega's Cabinet.   Since the March 23 signing of a vaguely worded temporary truce,talks aimed at achieving a lasting peace have foundered. The latestround of direct negotiations between the leftist Sandinistagovernment and the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, tookplace in Managua.   Borge said Nicaragua was drawn to the negotiating table becauseit ``has paid a high cost in blood'' in the war, which has crippledits economy since it began in November 1981. ``But if the Contraswere not badly beaten militarily, or held land, they would nevernegotiate with us,'' he said.   The Sandinistas once refused to hold direct talks with theContras or allow them to come to Nicargua. Borge acknowledged theback-pedaling, but emphasized: ``We will never discuss politicalpower'' with the Contras.   ``We understand the negotiations with the Contras are indirect(talks) with the United States,'' he added.   The Sandinistas maintained for years that any talks to end thewar should be with the United States because it financed theContras.   Borge dismissed rumors that the directorate was split betweenhis followers and those of President Ortega.   ``The worst enemies of revolutions are the revolutionaries ...who fight among themselves,'' Borge said. ``We all discuss anddiscuss until we're in agreement. There are certain contradictions.That's natural and helps contribute and move things forward.''   The handling of an ongoing strike has been regarded as anexample of differences between Borge and the president. WhileOrtega's brother, Gen. Humberto Ortega, met with Contra leaders inthe capital last week, Interior Ministry troops detained dozens ofpeople outside a union hall where more than 30 people were on ahunger strike.   Borge defended the action Tuesday night as a way to restorepublic order.   Two union leaders and three women strike sympathizers wereshoved into police vehicles on Tuesday after speaking withreporters a block from the hall. About 40 people have been takeninto custody since last week.   ``Our police are absolutely anti-repression. They never areabusive, or use torture or murder,'' Borge said.   Construction workers and car mechanics went on a hunger strikeApril 25 in support of a wildcat walkout that began Feb. 25 todemand higher wages.   Borge said the Sandinistas would give up power if they lost inelections, but said that would be the end of the Nicaraguanrevolution.   ``And this is impossible, nothing can kill the revolution,'' headded.   The Marxist-led Sandinistas came to power in a 1979 uprisingthat ended the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza. The Sandinistaspromised a better life, social programs and equality to the morethan 3 million Nicaraguans. The government now says many of itsprojects were lost in the war.   ``We've paid a high price to defend our national sovereignty anddignity,'' Borge said, noting that projects to improve educationand health fell short of projections and that there were foodshortages. He blamed the problems in part on the war and ``theerrors we committed.''   Asked if the government was Marxist-Leninist, Borge said theteachings of those two thinkers was ``a universal science andanyone who doesn't study it is either mentally retarded orignorant.'' He said Marxist-Leninist theory ``was an importantguide in our decisions.''   Borge praised the Sandinista relationship with the Soviet Union,which provides most of Nicaragua's aid. He said the Soviet Union``helps us and respects us and we appreciate it.''</TEXT></DOC>
