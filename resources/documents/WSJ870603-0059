For three seasons Laredo and its Mexican neighbor, Nuevo Laredo, have shared a franchise in the Mexican Baseball League. Half of the home games are played north of the Rio Grande and half south of it. The Tecos are more cosmopolitan than other athletic emigres, such as hockey's Montreal Canadiens or baseball's Toronto Blue Jays, who pay visits to the U.S. but make their homes abroad.    &quot;Tecolote,&quot; incidentally, is the Spanish word for owl, which calls attention to another distinction of this franchise: It was the first team in the Mexican League to play night baseball.    Tecos games begin with the playing of two national anthems, of course, but that is only one of the unusual features of the international entertainment. On &quot;800-to-1 Night&quot; this April in Laredo, Mexican fans were able to buy tickets with their own currency at an exchange rate significantly more favorable than the prevailing rate of 1,050 pesos to the dollar.    The Tecos also employ the only public-address announcer in baseball who is encouraged to fracture two languages at the same time. The team tried out 20 candidates for the job before concluding that Juan Ibarra, a bookstore manager, communicated in the most seamless blend of Spanish and English. &quot;Some of them were 70-30 and others were 20-80,&quot; Mr. Ibarra says of his competitors. &quot;But I was 50-50.&quot;    Here is how the man known as &quot;Johnny Tex-Mex&quot; introduces the leadoff hitter of an inning: &quot;El primer bateador para los Tecolotes here in the bottom of the fourth inning es Enrique Reyes, el catcher.&quot; Here is how he shills cold beer: &quot;Ah, la cerveza bien fria. Budweiser -- the king of beers. Miller, Miller Lite. We got 'em all.&quot;    The players he introduces are also a blend. The best hitter is Andres Mora, a 32-year-old Mexican who played briefly with the American League's Baltimore Orioles but returned to Mexico after finding neither American pitching nor American room service to his liking. The star pitcher is an American, 28-year-old Robin Fuson, who has recorded more than 120 victories in the minor leagues but has never pitched an inning in the majors.    But maybe the Tecos' biggest hero is Carlos Villarreal, the Laredo official most responsible for arranging their dual citizenship. Mr. Villarreal inherited an &quot;aficion&quot; for baseball from his grandmother, who took him across the border to Tecos games when he was a child and sneaked him out of a family funeral to catch the broadcast of the 1956 World Series contest in which Don Larsen threw a perfect game. &quot;That woman was a real fan,&quot; says Mr. Villarreal, now the city's director of community development.    It was in the early 1980s that Mr. Villarreal came to believe that Laredoans like his grandmother were eagerly waiting for a team to call their own. Just across the river were the Nuevo Laredo Tecolotes, a team whose attendance was suffering because of Mexico's economic depression.    &quot;With the decline of the peso, those American dollars over here began to look pretty good,&quot; says Larry Dovalina, the director of Laredo's civic center. To lure the Tecos, Laredo officals refurbished a weed-ridden high-school ballpark and persuaded immigration authorities to waive visa requirements for visiting Mexican players.    A tougher sales job was required to win over the baseball fans, who by nature are highly suspicious of change. &quot;When they win, they'll be the Tecos of Nuevo Laredo,&quot; said a Mexican bartender. &quot;When they lose, they'll be the Tecos of Laredo.&quot;    The players also had misgivings when they saw their new American home before the opening game of 1985. Tecos pitchers claimed that it was a hitters' ballpark. The hitters complained that it favored the pitchers. In the opener, Tecos pitchers yielded 10 runs -- but didn't complain too much since Tecos hitters racked up 25.    &quot;Playing in Laredo seemed strange at first, like being visitors in an unfamiliar park,&quot; says Mr. Mora. &quot;But now it is an advantage for us, like having two homes.&quot; This year, in fact, the Tecos have put together the Mexican League's longest home-field winning streak -- 13 games -- playing in Texas. Going into last night's games, the Tecos, with a record of 39 and 37, were two games out of first place in the league's North Division.    This bilateral experiment on the border is gaining attention in the interior of both Mexico and the U.S. Mr. Villarreal felt confident enough about local support to propose Laredo as the site for next year's Mexican League All-Star Game. (A site hasn't been selected yet.) This year, the Tecos started an affiliation with the Cincinnati Reds, who lent the Tecos four minor-league players in need of more experience.    In Laredo, they get to experience a lot. Each game features a contingent from the Municipal Band of Nuevo Laredo -- three horns, two drums and a saxophone -- which promotes harmony politically, if not musically. The band thumps out a song honoring the hometown of each Teco who steps to the plate: a northern Mexico ballad for hometown favorite Gerardo Garza, &quot;Veracruz&quot; for third baseman Alejandro Ortiz.    Last year, when the Tecos signed Rodney Craig, an American from New Orleans, the band members worked up a salsa-style version of &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In.&quot; They also play it for center fielder Allen Sigler of Memphis, Tenn., and for right fielder Jordan Berge of Pueblo, Colo. &quot;Their repertoire of American songs isn't very large,&quot; admits Mr. Villarreal.    Newcomers also quickly learn that the Mexican League is dominated by hitters. (An old saying among pitchers is &quot;Tirale y agachate,&quot; or &quot;Throw it and duck.&quot;) Last year, the hitters had added motivation to swing for the fences here: A Laredo paper offered $25 for any ball hit over an advertising placard on the left-field fence.    Unfortunately, the sign proved too great a temptation. &quot;There were just too many fly balls going out to left field,&quot; Mr. Ibarra says. &quot;The manager didn't like that. They had to paint over it.&quot;    In any Tecos game, though, some of the most formidable sluggers are in the stands. &quot;I'll tell you why the players win at home -- they're afraid not to,&quot; says John Boyles, one of the players on loan from the Cincinnati organization. &quot;They can't imagine what the fans might do.&quot; One night a security guard at the Laredo park walked into the stands with the intention of collaring some rowdies. Instead, the fans picked him up and passed him back out to the aisle.    But the fans are just as demonstrative in displaying affection. When the Famous Chicken (formerly the San Diego Chicken) flew in for a Tecos game here, the crush of enthusiastic fans made him immediately feel at home. &quot;I think I know how a pinata feels,&quot; said Ted Giannoulas, the man inside the chicken suit. </TEXT></DOC>
