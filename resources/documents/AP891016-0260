A spokesman saidBush still hoped for a last-minute compromise, but ``it might evenbe good'' if the budget ax does fall.   Meanwhile, budget director Richard Darman said the cuts will befelt faster than the last time they were invoked.   The cutbacks are required under the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budgetlaw because of the failure of Congress and the White House to agreeon a deficit-reduction package.   Unless the House and Senate work out a compromise version oftheir deficit-cutting bills and send it to Bush by midnight _considered virtually impossible because many lawmakers were out oftown _ the president is required to sign the order.   ``The very, very high odds are that ... we'll end up insequester,'' the formal name for the automatic cuts, RichardDarman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, toldreporters today.   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would sign an orderthis afternoon that will appear in Tuesday's Federal Registerspecifying the across-the-board cuts in most federal programs,outside of Social Security and other entitlements.   If Congress somehow managed to pass a stripped-downdeficit-reduction bill and sent it to Bush before midnight, thepresident would sign it and there would be no cuts, Fitzwater said.   But echoing comments that Darman made Sunday, the White Housespokesman said ``it's not the end of the world, and there are somereasons why it might even be good'' if the reductions took effect.   ``There would be sizable cuts and they would be real. Theywouldn't be any accounting changes. They'd be real money thatwouldn't be spent,'' said Fitzwater.   Darman said the cuts will be imposed at a very low level offederal agency operations, making it harder for bureaucrats totransfer money to compensate for the reductions.   When the automatic cuts were last invoked for two months in1987, they were applied at a higher level, making them easier todeal with, and they were barely noticed by most Americans.   ``It has a little more discipline to it,'' Darman said of thechanged method of imposing the cuts.   The reductions, spread evenly across many defense and domesticprograms, are expected to total about $8.1 billion for defense and$8.1 billion for domestic initiatives. That works out to reductionsof about 4.3 percent in defense programs and 5.3 percent indomestic agencies.   The cuts are expected to be rolled back as soon as Congressworks out a compromise deficit-reduction bill. The Senate approvedits version of the measure late Friday, and House-Senatenegotiators could begin their meetings this week.   But Darman said Sunday it might be best if Congress left thespending cuts in place instead of rolling them back.   ``This time, if it goes into effect, I think it would be good ifpeople would live with it and say, `don't restore the cuts,'''Darman said on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week With DavidBrinkley.''   Automatic budget cuts took effect in 1986 and 1987 as well, butCongress acted quickly to restore the lost funds, a process thatDarman called ``phony.''   The reductions are not expected to be felt by many Americans, atleast initially.   ``It affects a relatively small number of people in our society,and affects them in a relatively small way,'' Rep. Bill Frenzel ofMinnesota, ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, saidlast week.   The automatic Gramm-Rudman cuts, when the law was enacted in1985, were intended to seem so horrific that Congress and thepresident would be frightened into cutting the federal deficit inorder to avoid them.   It didn't quite work out this year.   The law requires a projected deficit for fiscal 1990 _ whichbegan Oct. 1 _ of no more than $100 billion. If the projectedshortfall exceeds the target by more than $10 billion today, thelaw automatically triggers cuts in spending of whatever is requiredto slash the figure to $100 billion.   The White House's Office of Management and Budget _ which makesthe projections _ estimated in August that the 1990 deficit wouldbe $116.2 billion.   The cuts apply to all defense programs except for money alreadyowed because of signed contracts. That means that about $190billion out of the budget's $300 billion for defense is subject toreductions.   Nearly 75 percent of domestic spending is exempt from the cutsunder a series of special rules written into the law. Programs notsubject to any cuts include Social Security, payments on thenational debt, other federal retirement and disability programs,veterans' pensions and compensation, and state unemploymentbenefits.   A host of other domestic programs are vulnerable to only limitedcuts. Medicare, veterans' medical care, community and migranthealth centers and Indian health facilities cannot be cut by morethan 2 percent.   Early on, agencies _ which receive their budgets in monthly orquarterly allotments _ cope by delaying purchases, leaving vacantjobs unfilled, reducing travel and shifting money within accounts.   The law forbids officials to save money by cutting workers'salaries. This covers virtually all government workers _ thepresident, members of Congress, judges, civil servants _ with theexception of congressional staff workers, whose pay is determinedby senators and representatives.   Technically, the Gramm-Rudman cuts ``temporarily'' took effectOct. 1, and agencies have been watching their budgets since then.</TEXT></DOC>
