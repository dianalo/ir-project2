Symbolic-processing or artificial-intelligence technologiesare a vital component of the production engineering computing environment.Symbolic processing is based on discrete mathematics, whereas, numericalanalysis is based on calculus. Advances in computer technology have madediscrete mathematics as indispensable as calculus to science and technology.</TEXT></DOC>
