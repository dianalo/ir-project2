ROM 18 includes random      number memory 21 and symbol table memory 22a-22c per each reel, which will      be described later. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows an example of arrangement of symbols described on the      peripheral side surface of each reel 2a-2c. Numeral of 1-22 on the left      side column indicates the numbers of symbols in row, while the letters on      the right side column indicate the kind of symbols, signs such as TC, 1B      and 3B showing the symbols relating to winning games and the mark--showing      the symbols not relating to winning games. </PAR><PAR>  With three symbols appearing in said display window 3, when each reel is at      a standstill, there are 22 groups of symbols that appear on the window at      one time as shown in FIG. 5. If those duplicating groups are deducted,      there remains 17 groups as shown in FIG. 6. Therefore, the total numbers      of combination of symbols are; 17.times.17.times.17 andequals;4,913. </PAR><PAR>  In the present example of embodiment, as shown in FIG. 7, the appearance      rate p x n of appearing manner of each symbol can be set up at will, by      allotting voluntary weighting value W.times.n (n being 0, 1, 2, . . . 16)      to appearance group SC, assuming reel number to be as x (x being 1, 2 and      3). </PAR><PAR>  In said FIG. 7, TWx indicates the summed up total value of weighting of the      reel number x. The summed up total value of weighting each reel of number      1-3, that is TW.sub.1 -TW.sub.3 can be obtained in the following equations      1-3. And the appearance rate Pxn of each group of symbols is also given by      the equation 4.      ##EQU1## </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 shows the relationship between the appearance group of symbols SC      and the random number m. Here, the random number m is the number allotted      to each symbol in accordance with the weighting value. Therefore, for      example, when the weighting value is 2, 2 pieces of random numbers are      given; when the weighting value is 5, 5 pieces of random numbers are      given. </PAR><PAR>  In the example as given in said FIG. 8, as regards No. 1 reel 2a, when the      appearance group SC is 1 (SCandequals;1), the weighting value being &quot;1&quot;, one piece      of number &quot;0&quot; is given as the random number. In the same way, when SCandequals;2,      the weighting value being &quot;2&quot;, two pieces of following numbers &quot;1&quot;0 and      &quot;2&quot;  are given as the random numbers. </PAR><PAR>  In the same way, random numbers m corresponding to the summed up weighting      values in total are allotted. And these random numbers are stored in the      random number memory 21, and symbol table TB.sub.1 -TB.sub.3 with regard      to each reel 2a-2c are stored in symbol table memory 22a-22c respectively. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 shows the processes of control by the microcomputer in      above-mentioned microcomputer 10. </PAR><PAR>  First, if the power source is turned on, the micro-computer 10 is set to      the initial state. As Step 1 (shown in the drawing as ST1). Next, at Step      2, CPU 16 checks if the coins were shot into from the coin shoot inlet 5.      Upon detecting that the coins were shot into by the coin shooting sensor      15, the judgement of detection signal by step 2 turns &quot;Yes&quot;, CPU 16 checks      if the start handle 8 has been operated as the next Step 3. As the handle      switch 14 turns on by the handle operation, the judgement of Step 3 turns      &quot;Yes&quot;, and CPU 16 starts reels 2a-2c as the next Step 4. In the following      Step 5, each reel extract random number m from the random memory 21. </PAR><PAR>  After detecting appearance state SC of symbol per each reel corresponding      to each random number m with reference made to each symbol table 22a-22c      by CPU 16, it controls stop action of drive unit of each reel No. 1-No. 3      so that each reel 2a-2c will realize the respective appearance state of      each reel 2a-2c, which is Step 7. </PAR><PAR>  As 3 reels of 2a-2c come to a standstill, CPU 16 judges the combination of      symbols having aligned on the stop line 4 in Step 8. If the result is as      defined, judgement of Step 9, turns &quot;Yes&quot;, which drives the coin payout      unit 12 to release the coins of defined payout rate from the coin      releasing outlet 6 (being Step 10). </PAR><PAR>  In this way, because it has set up the appearance rate of each symbols at      the stop position at will by allotting a voluntary weighting to each      symbol of individual reel 2a-2c, it is sufficient with merely changing the      weighting value to each symbol in order to change the payout rate, meaning      that it is an extremely simple work for the alteration. </PAR><PAR>  In the above, descriptions were made as regards the favorable embodiment of      the present invention. One can implement various variations and amendments      without deviating from the basic spirit of the invention. Consequently,      the scope of the invention is defined only with the appending claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
