OATIS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   A blast of cold air out of Alaska brought snowstorms and plungingtemperatures to the West and Midwest, triggering hundreds of trafficaccidents and closing schools, and threatened to end the East'srecord warm spell today.   ``Today was it. It will get seasonal,'' National Weather Servicemeteorologist Bill Scura said at Atlantic City Airport in Pomona,N.J., where a balmy reading of 69 degrees was one of 51high-temperature records broken or tied in the East and South onWednesday.   At least two people died in weather-related traffic accidents inIdaho and Oregon on Wednesday. Authorities in Coleraine, Minn.,blamed minus 20-degree temperatures for the hypothermia death of a31-year-old woman whose frozen body was found on a sidewalk.   Snow continued falling today from the Pacific Northwest to thenorthern Rockies, northern Plains, and upper Mississippi Valley, andwas expected to spread to the Great Lakes. Freezing drizzleslickened roads from Missouri to Indiana.   The foul weather was accompanied by equally foul temperatures inmany places. In the Dakotas and Montana, where Gov. Stan Stephensdeclared a state of emergency, winds up to 40 mph produced windchills as low as minus 90 degrees Wednesday.   Low-temperature records for the date were set this morning inCasper, Wyo., where it was 23 below zero; Great Falls, Mont., 33below; and Sheridan, Wyo., whose 28-below reading beat the oldrecord by 8 degrees.   The storms caused traffic accidents in Washington state, Oregon,California and Utah, and knocked out power to thousands of people inWashington, Montana and Utah.   Snow closed schools in Washington, Oregon and Idaho on Wednesday,and dangerously low temperatures shut them in Montana today and inNorth Dakota through Friday. Farther east, some schools in Indianaand Michigan were closed because of freezing rain that made travelhazardous.   Pupils at Richholt Elementary School in Bismarck, N.D., were``running down the halls and shouting, `Sinner for president! Sinnerfor president!''' Principal Rick Buresh said Wednesday after Gov.George Sinner ordered schools shut. Officials said it was the firsttime in memory that schools were closed statewide in North Dakotabecause of cold.   Near Truckee, Calif., in the Sierra Nevada 75 miles northeast ofSacramento, a tour bus overturned on icy, wind-swept Interstate 80,sending 23 people to the hospital, authorities said. Six wereadmitted.   In Washington, icy roads caused a 100-car string of accidents onInterstate 5 just north of Seattle, said State Patrol spokesman BillBurkett. More than 200 accidents were reported in the Puget Soundarea.   Winds gusted over 100 mph, knocking out power to up to 15,000customers in the Bellingham area, and 1,500 others in the westernpart of the state. Snow caved in the roof of Everett's soccercenter, doing $250,000 damage.   Snowy runways caused delays at Seattle-Tacoma InternationalAirport, ferries were kept at their docks in Seattle, pipes frozeand auto parts stores reported runs on antifreeze and tire chains.   ``I've already run out of several sizes (of chains),'' said JohnMcCall, assistant manager of the McCall Les Schwab Tire Center inAstoria, Ore.   In Utah, rain cut power to 4,000 people in Salt Lake City andhundreds more in communities as far north as Ogden about 40 milesaway. Snow followed the rain in Salt Lake City, which ended up with11.9 inches of snow in 24 hours, a record for a 24-hour period inFebruary.   In Wyoming, up to 10 inches of snow and gusting winds prompted aban on some snowmobile travel and all backcountry travel atYellowstone National Park, said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo. Asmuch as a foot of snow was expected today.   In western Nebraska, the plunge in temperatures from the 20sTuesday to below zero Wednesday resulted in a 20 percent increase inbusiness at the Sapp Bros.-Sidney truck stop, said Manager MikeMachamer.   ``Hot chocolate, hot coffee, doughnuts and hot dogs, anythingthat's hot'' sold big, Machamer said.   Freezing drizzle this morning caused a Delta 727 bound forAtlanta to skid partway off an icy taxiway at Detroit MetropolitanAirport, officials said. No one among the 57 on board was injured.The right landing gear of the plane got stuck in the mud, and thepassengers were put on another flight.   The East and South enjoyed gentler weather Wednesday. It was 63degrees in Portland, Maine; 66 degrees in Boston; 80 degrees inLittle Rock, Ark.; and 74 in Richmond, Va. Records dating to 1887fell.   Around normally cold New England, office workers in shirtsleevesenjoyed lunch breaks outdoors and people wheeled babies around cityparks.   On Atlantic City's boardwalk, strollers were out in force and anopen bench was hard to find.   ``Isn't this beautiful!'' said Robert Murdock, a retired postalworker from New York City. ``After you've worked for so many yearsinside, this is the gravy.''   But today's forecast held temperatures in the single digits andteens in northern Maine and in the 20s and 30s in the rest of NewEngland and the Great Lakes. New York state, Pennsylvania, Arkansas,Kentucky and northern Texas were expected to have readings in the40s and 50s.   By midmorning today, the mid-Atlantic states still hadabove-normal temperatures. But in Burlington, Vt., the temperaturehad dropped from 46 degrees at 1 p.m. Wednesday to 9 degrees at 9a.m. today.   ``This warm spell won't last long,'' weather service forecasterMike Wyllie warned from Boston.</TEXT></DOC>
