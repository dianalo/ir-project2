Miss Hall was named along with Robert Earle, a former assistantto North on the National Security Council staff, and Joe Fernandez,a former CIA agent, the Los Angeles Times reported.   The action, which has been kept under court seal, allowsindependent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to use the testimony of theunindicted co-conspirators against the prosecutor's primarytargets: North, former national security adviser John Poindexter,retired Gen. Richard Secord and Iranian-born arms dealer AlbertHakim.   Citing unidentified sources close to the investigation, theTimes said the move is significant because it distinguishes MissHall, Earle and Fernandez from conventional witnesses whosetestimony would apply only to one defendant at a time.   James Wieghart, a spokesman for Walsh, declined to comment onthe report Saturday in Washington.   Miss Hall's attorney, Plato Cacheris said: ``I don't regard heras a co-conspirator, and this is grossly unfair and incorrect.''   North, Poindexter, Secord and Hakim were indicted on charges ofconspiring to divert Iran arms sale profits to the NicaraguanContra rebels.   Hearsay testimony from an alleged member of a conspiracy, evenif unindicted, can be used against all members of the conspiracybecause the witness was close to events, the Times said.   Walsh has reportedly granted full immunity to Miss Hall andEarle. Fernandez has not been granted immunity, however, and couldstill face charges, sources told the Times.   In testimony before a congressional committee last year, MissHall admitted removing classified materials from the NSC officeswhile she was North's personal secretary. She and Earle haveadmitted shredding documents later sought in the investigation.   Fernandez, former CIA chief of station in Costa Rica, hasacknowledged involvement in secret U.S. airdrops to the Contras ata time when Congress had banned military aid to the rebels.   Earle's lawyer, Dennis Dean Kirk, declined to comment. JohnStein, the attorney representing Fernandez, could not be reachedfor comment.   The process of naming unindicted co-conspirators has come undercriticism on the ground that because they are not defendants, theydo not have the opportunity to clear themselves in court.</TEXT></DOC>
