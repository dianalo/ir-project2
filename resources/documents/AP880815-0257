For six decades, the genial, white-bearded artist has sat in thetheater and sketched, making graceful line drawings that seem tocome alive on the page.   `I've learned to annoy as few people as possible,'' he wassaying the other day, reflecting on all the hard work he has doneduring performances with a small sketch pad and a Venus HB pencil.   Hirschfeld was sitting in a barber chair in his studio on thetop floor of an East Side brownstone where he has lived for morethan 40 years with his wife, Dolly. It's where he finishes all hisdrawings.   Today, Hirschfeld draws more than theater folk. Movie stars,television personalities, politicians, even ordinary citizens arehis subjects, but it's the theater drawings, particularly hissketches that appear regularly in The New York Times, that mostpeople remember.   On a slanted and well-worn drawing table perched in front of thebarber chair, Hirschfeld opens a large sketch book. It's filledwith what look like random doodles _ a cigar, wicker furniture, thedetail of window, a bow tie. They're bits and pieces ofremembrances from the recent Broadway production of ``Long Day'sJourney into Night.''   ``These are very helpful in putting together a sketch,'' hesays. ``You can't trust a faulty memory.''   These sketches were interspersed with roughly drawn portraits ofthe play's two stars, Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst.   ``She has a way of putting her hand to her face all the time,''he says.   Hirschfeld says he does no research before beginning to sketch anew show.   ``The characters are what interests me, but as for the playitself, sometimes I come out and I don't know what it was allabout,'' he says. ``When I'm working, I concentrate on the actualdesign or the image rather than the thought. Later I go to theopening and can see the play.''   Hirschfeld has always been partial to drawing thelarger-than-life actors, particularly comedians.   ``Most of them have invented themselves,'' he says. ``They knowwhat they look like. People like Carol Channing, Zero Mostel and,in the earlier days, the Marx Brothers, Buster Keaton, CharlieChaplin or Mae West. They were all real inventions. The modernactor is a little more the fellow next door. The people in thestreet are more theatrical than most actors today.''   The artist used to go out of town, to Philadelphia, Boston orNew Haven, to see new shows and do his sketches. Today, with theBroadway tryout a rare occurrence, he goes to rehearsals orrun-throughs to do his sketching or even draws from photographs orvideocassettes supplied by producers.   ``It's the little things that help develop the character in adrawing,'' Hirschfeld explains. ``Some simple little thing, likethe way a fellow holds his hand or his cigarette. George Burns, forinstance, the way he holds a cigar is very unique. He holds itdifferently than Groucho does.''   Hirschfeld, born in St. Louis, started out as a sculptor andlater turned to painting.   ``Then suddenly I developed this insane passion for line, andwhat you can do with it, and how it can communicate,'' he recalls.``It's always mysterious to me how it happens.''   His first drawing in The New York Times appeared in 1925, asketch of Sir Harry Lauder, a famous comedian of the day, makingone of many ``farewell'' tours in New York.   From then on, Hirschfeld was hooked on the theater and theactors on stage.   ``I'm more interested in people than in nature,'' he says. ``Itwould never occur to me to sit on the lip of the Grand Canyon andpaint it. I'm interested in people, the way they dress and eat andwalk and dance and talk. Whatever they do.''   Hirschfeld's drawings have also intrigued people because he puts``Nina,'' the name of his daughter, in all his sketches. He got theidea the day she was born in 1945.   ``I just wanted to record it historically that she was here,''he says. ``I kept it up for two or three weeks and then tried tostop it. I would leave Nina out but the mail was unbelievable.''   Today, ``Nina'' is always the last thing to go into one of hisdrawings and he puts a little number next to his name if there aretwo or more Ninas in a picture.   Nina will even make an appearance on a postage stamp. Hirschfeldhas designed three 25-cent stamps _ portraits of Laurel and Hardy,Mary Pickford and Rosa Ponselle _ that the Postal Service willrelease over the next year. It took a special decision byPostmaster General Anthony Frank to allow the stamps to have Ninaimprinted on them.   Hirschfeld calls his job ``a lemming profession,'' one whichapparently has no future, and says there are very few outlets forhis kind of work.   ``I'm always surprised that I get paid for all of this,''Hirschfeld says. ``I would do it anyway. Maybe not in the theaterbut I certainly would be sitting around a cafe and be doodling away.   ``My demands on life are very small. I like what I'm doing. Idon't have any hobbies. I'm here all day long seven days a week andin the evening we go to the theater or have people in and sitaround and talk. I find that very engaging. I could never retire. Iwouldn't know what to do with my time.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 28</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
