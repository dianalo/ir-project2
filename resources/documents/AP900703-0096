The 1990 World Economic Survey by the U.N. Department ofInternational Economic and Social Affairs said world economicoutput increased by 3.1 percent in 1989, compared with 4.4 percentin 1988.   It noted diversity in economic performance and said thatindustrialized market economies continued to expand, growing by 3.5percent. Although that was lower than the 4.3 percent in 1988, itwas stronger than had been expected, the report said.   But the developing world as a whole, it said, suffered adownturn in economic growth in 1989, dropping from 4.5 percent in1988 to 3.4 percent in 1989. Economic performance varied greatly byregion.   The report agreed in general with the findings of theParis-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,which said last week that the economies of the industrialized worldremain on a steady course.   Like the OECD report, it warned against inflation, especially inEast European countries that are changing from state-controlled tomarket economies.   ``Economic growth in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union came toa virtual halt in 1989,'' it said, adding that output increased byonly 1.2 percent. U.N. economists said they did not expect a brightpicture for the immediate future in countries restructuring theireconomies, although the long-term prospects could improve withpainful reform.   ``The danger of rapid inflation in the reforming socialistcountries is a major concern,'' it said, ``requiring prudentmonetary and fiscal policies during the transition to moremarket-oriented economies.''   World trade, it said, maintained considerable buoyance andincreased by 6.7 percent in 1989. It was the fifth consecutive yearin which the increase in world trade exceeded the increase in worldoutput, the report said.   It observed that the ``Brady Plan,'' named for former TreasurySecretary Nicolas Brady, ``is not solving the debt problem of theheavily indebted countries.''   In 1989, it said, Latin America made a net transfer of $28billion in financial resources to other countries. Africa's netreceipts of financial resources amounted to only $3 billion in1989, a decline of $1 billion from the previous year.   In several Latin American countries hyperinflation is a seriousproblem, it said, and stabilization policies are likely to provecostly in the short term. Long-term prospects are uncertain.   The U.N. survey also predicted that world oil consumption willreach a record high in 1990 and the gap between sustainableproduction capacity and demand will narrow.   The survey said developing countries as a group experienced asharp slowdown in economic growth in 1989. Their increase in outputdeclined from 4.5 percent in 1988 to 3.4 percent in 1989.   The economies of South and East Asia grew by 6.2 percent,compared with 8.2 percent in 1988, the survey said. China's growthrate delined sharply, from 11.4 percent in 1988 to 3.9 percent in1989.   Latin America and the Caribbean saw only a 0.7 percent increaseand per capita output fell for the second consecutive year.Inflation was unprecedented in the region.   In Africa, economies expanded by 2.8 percent in 1989, below therate of population growth, and per capita output fell as a result.   In West Asia, economic recovery continued with a 2.5 percentgrowth rate. Economic stabilization measures stalled growth inMediterranean countries.   The survey proposed establishment of a Central European PaymentsUnion, similar to the European Payments Union established afterWorld War II, as a temporary measure to assist reforming EasternEuropean countries in their transition to market-oriented economieswith convertible currencies.   ``Inflation is an inevitable consequence of the market-orientedeconomic reform under way in the socialist countries,'' the surveysaid.</TEXT></DOC>
