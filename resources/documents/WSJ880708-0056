In terms of human tragedy, the destruction of Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s Piper Alpha production platform represented history's worst oil field accident. A roaring gas leak Wednesday, followed by several explosions, sent men jumping into fiery waters. As of last night, only 68 of the approximately 230 workers on the platform were known to have survived. In addition, an oil platform valued at upward of $1 billion had been mostly blown apart to the water line.    Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental, planned to fly to Scotland to check out the situation for himself. But while the company is investigating leads, it doesn't yet know the cause of the accident.    The explosion reverberated through world oil markets yesterday, propelling prices upward by as much as $1 a barrel for everything from gasoline to home-heating oil. In London, equity markets reeled and oil markets surpassed record trading days. Officials of Occidental and Texaco Inc., which had major North Sea oil fields shut down as a result of the accident, forecast a negative effect on earnings, while some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries began seeking ways to fill the North Sea gap.    New York trading was frenetic. &quot;We have 100 phone lines coming into our operation and people were getting busy signals,&quot; said Richard Donovan, senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s energy department.    World oil markets have been more-than-amply supplied, and the shuttering of six North Sea oil fields for safety reasons will remove only 300,000 barrels of daily oil production, perhaps slightly more. While that represents about 12% of the total output of the North Sea's United Kingdom sector, it also equals less than 1% of total world output.    Just the same, yesterday's near-hysterical reaction by oil traders showed that oil remains one of the world's most delicately balanced markets. &quot;There's no question that the explosion takes enough oil off the market to create a real rally,&quot; said Tom Petrie, Denver-based analyst with First Boston Corp. Added Paul Mlotok, international oil analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., New York: &quot;What we've done here is cut off the momentum of a pretty serious slide&quot; in oil prices.    Many industry analysts and officials attributed the extent of yesterday's rally to the psychology of the panic-prone futures and spot markets for oil. In supply and demand terms, &quot;At the end of the day, there's still a surplus,&quot; said Arnold Stancell, a Mobil Corp. executive in Europe.    But psychological reactions these days often become self-fulfilling in oil. Yesterday, prices jumped first in &quot;daisy chain&quot; trading of cargoes of North Sea Brent crude oil, in turn driving up the price of &quot;video barrels&quot; in futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, in turn pushing up the price of &quot;wet barrels&quot; on the Texas Gulf coast -- all of which means that consumers ultimately will pay more.    &quot;This focuses people's minds on the upside instead of the downside,&quot; said Humphrey Harrison, oil analyst at the London brokerage firm of Kitcat andamp; Aitken. &quot;The sentiment now is speculation on shortages.&quot;    The timing of the event was everything but extraordinary. It occurred within hours of a report by the American Petroleum Institute that U.S. gasoline demand was surging -- and that supplies were being drawn down much more quickly than had been realized. No sooner had the accident occurred than a possible labor strike in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea threatened to cut off even more production. Iraq made two strikes against Iranian oil targets. A terrorist attack shut down oil exports yesterday from Colombia -- where Occidental is also a major producer.    &quot;It's a scary market,&quot; said Dick Perkins, chief trader for Chevron Corp. in New York.    For the U.S., the renewed firmness in oil prices coincides with another critical event: the drought. Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's undersecretary for economic affairs, said in an interview that higher oil prices, coupled with an increase in food prices, could cause the 1988 inflation rate to exceed 5%, rather than the 4% he had been projecting.    &quot;It looks like we may be getting a double-barrel dose of bad luck,&quot; Mr. Ortner said.    The incident has already affected more than oil prices. Ill-starred Texaco -- after years of costly litigation, oil field accidents and a hard-fought proxy fight with investor Carl C. Icahn -- will doubtless experience an adverse earnings effect, a source close to the company said.    &quot;We just got rid of Icahn,&quot; added an official of White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco. &quot;We could have done without this.&quot; Texaco shares nevertheless closed up 25 cents at $47.50 in active Big Board composite trading.    Another participant in the platform and shut-down fields, Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc., Houston, quickly checked into its insurance coverage and announced that it had $137.8 million of physical-damage coverage. A Lloyd's of London spokesman said the accident is likely to produce a claim of $1 billion; the platform's coverage, he said, had been underwritten &quot;world-wide, but substantially in London.&quot;    Although the nation's largest independent oil company, Houston-based Union Texas is far smaller that either Texaco or Occidental. As a result, its share price took a big hit in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $10.875, down $1. Union Texas, as well as International Thomson PLC, which also owns an interest in one of the fields, likewise suspended performance on certain North Sea crude-oil delivery contracts.    As for the operator, Los Angeles-based Occidental, the event by itself could wipe away five cents to 10 cents a share from annual earnings, Ray R. Irani, president and chief operating officer, said in an interview. He added that Occidental expects earnings to surpass last year's net income of $240 million, or $1.06 a share, on revenue of $17.75 billion, despite the accident. Although it is uninsured for lost production, Occidental property is covered to as much as $525 million, and its liabilities to a total of $335 million.    Occidental's shares closed at $26.25, down 62.5 cents, on the Big Board yesterday.    The explosion, which occurred 120 miles northeast of Aberdeen, Scotland, wasn't the first incident aboard the 650-foot, 37,000-ton Piper platform. An explosion and fire in March 1984 shuttered production. Last year, a man died when he fell off the Occidental platform. British news services also reported that government inspectors cleared the platform in a routine check last month.    Such checks are bound to step up -- in the North Sea and elsewhere, industry officials said. At nearly 12 years old, the platform is only slightly older than average age, meaning that many other offshore facilities have been exposed for much longer periods to the kind of corrosion and debilitations that could help explain why the Piper Alpha blew up.    &quot;I don't see the {British} government shutting down fields right and left,&quot; Mr. Harrison, the London oil analyst, said. &quot;But there will be a tightening of safety procedures and maybe a closing of each field in turn to allow inspectors to check safety features.&quot;    Yesterday afternoon, a fire continued blazing on the little of Piper Alpha remaining above water -- one of four major structural sections. Occidental said late yesterday that &quot;small amounts&quot; of oil were spewing from wells beneath the Piper platform. As soon as the fire burns itself out, divers are expected to go down and see what's left underwater. What they find will help determine whether the impact will be of little or great duration -- or possibly permanent.    The platform is the focal point of a pipeline network emanating from six surrounding oil fields: the Piper, Scapa and Claymore, which are operated by Occidental, and the Tartan, Highlander and Petronella, which are operated by Texaco. All were closed -- some automatically. Steps were being taken, Occidental said, to remove natural gas from the pipelines that flow into Piper.    Ultimately, the crude produced in the fields is shipped to a huge terminal at Flotta, Scotland, which itself is now out of commission because it has no inventory.    Texaco can move the crude from its fields to the Flotta terminal from a terminal at the Claymore Field. But the Claymore platform is connected to the burning Piper Platform by pipeline, meaning that nothing can be transported beyond Claymore until the pipeline between Claymore and Piper is severed and sealed off. Thus, Texaco is considering moving crude-oil carriers directly to its fields to pick up oil until the pipelines are fixed.    Texaco is hoping to get 75% of the production from its three oil fields up and running within a month, said a source close to the company. Repairing Occidental's production platform could easily take a year, however, and might not be worth replacing at all, some industry officials said.    Kate Graham, an Occidental spokeswoman in Aberdeen, last night said company engineers already had completed an initial inspection of the explosion site. She said the blast seems to have originated in the steel platform's &quot;C&quot; chamber, where gas is compressed before it is sent on or burned off. The blast quickly was followed by a series of explosions and fires.    &quot;It appears there was just that initial massive explosion that just took everybody unawares,&quot; Ms. Graham said. That's why &quot;we had men jumping from the platform.&quot; She also said the fire &quot;was coming from topside,&quot; suggesting the disaster wasn't caused by an undersea explosion.    She said one of the survivors reported hearing a &quot;banshee wail&quot; slightly before the first blast. &quot;That may have been the alarm,&quot; she said, rather than the noise of escaping gas. &quot;The suddenness is what took everybody by surprise.&quot;    It may be a &quot;considerable time&quot; before Occidental can determine the explosion's cause, she added. </TEXT></DOC>
