Not only were government expenditures as a ratio of GDP the highest in the European Community in 1960 but they also recorded the steepest rise. They stood in the eight major countries at 32.3% in 1960, as opposed to 26.8% in the U.S. and 18.2% in Japan. By 1986 they had reached 50.4% in Europe and 35.3% in the U.S. In Japan, they were about 35% in 1983. To finance the growth in government expenditure a sharp rise in tax receipts and social security contributions was necessary, along with a rise in public debts, especially in Europe.    Employment, meanwhile, grew at an average annual rate of about 0.1% a year in the 12 EC countries, 1% in Japan and an astonishing 1.9% in the U.S. Among other factors contributing to the different growth rates is the expansion of the labor force: Population grew at about 1.1% a year both in Japan and the U.S., while it grew at about 0.5% in the EC. Other important differences are that regulations about layoffs are less rigid in the U.S. than in Europe, that rigidities in the European labor market are in general greater and that the level of taxation, and taxation of labor in particular, is higher in Europe.    The growth of taxation and social security contributions has depressed employment in Europe by increasing the cost of labor to corporations. Increased taxes create a wedge between the after-tax wage rate, or take-home pay, and the cost of labor to firms. It is still debated whether sales or value-added taxes should be included in the wedge, i.e., whether the dependent worker is indifferent in evaluating his standard of living between paying more value-added taxes and fewer income taxes or vice versa.    An increased tax wedge generally leads to a higher cost of labor for firms and, as a result, to increased substitution of capital for labor, lower production levels and to increased production in countries where the cost of labor does not increase as much. During recent decades most European industries experienced sharp increases in the capital-labor ratios and losses of jobs. It is also likely that the jump in tax receipts in Europe in this period has substantially contributed to the development of the so-called newly industrialized countries -- Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore.    The extent of the increase in the cost of labor for a given tax rise depends in turn on two factors: The power that labor unions have to prevent a fall in the after-tax wage and the value that the worker attributes to the additional government expenditure.    If labor unions are very strong, most of the tax increase will be &quot;shifted forward&quot; onto higher labor costs. The same will happen if the workers attribute little value to the increased government expenditure, because they will refuse to accept a reduction in their disposable income, or after-tax wage, if they get very little in exchange for paying higher taxes. It is therefore likely that in countries where governments are efficient and government officials are responsive to the needs of the population the degree of forward-shifting of taxes will be lower.    In addition, to the extent that higher taxes tend to reduce the after-tax wage, the incentive to work will be reduced. Recent research suggests that married women especially tend to be discouraged from seeking work when income taxes increase. In many European countries top marginal tax rates exceed 60%, but in special cases marginal tax rates can surpass 100% even at lower income levels if the loss of transfers and benefits is taken into account, when someone finds a job.    A major difference between the U.S. and Europe in this respect is that because of the lesser power of labor unions and more competitive labor markets in the U.S., higher taxation there mainly discourages potential workers from seeking employment, while in Europe the negative effect on employment operates mainly via a higher cost for labor.    During the 1980s, virtually all European governments have pursued reductions in budget deficits and many have been quite successful in this respect. This, however, has prompted many countries to further increase tax revenues. From 1980 to 1986, only the German government in the EC has succeeded in slightly reducing the ratio of tax and social security revenues to GDP.    If the channels discussed above are important, as I believe they are, much bolder cuts in inefficient government expenditures and in tax revenues are required in Europe than what has been taken so far if unemployment is to fall significantly.    Probably the right order of magnitude of the cuts would be about 1% of GDP a year for at least 10 years for tax revenues and slightly more for government expenditures. Suggestions of bold cuts in expenditures are, however, generally dismissed on the ground that they are &quot;politically unacceptable.&quot; But a government that proposes to cut tax revenues by the amounts suggested above may gain enough popular support to resist the strong lobbies that gain from high government expenditures.    Margaret Thatcher's government has preached the kind of policies suggested here but achieved very little. Government expenditure as a share of GDP increased in the United Kingdom from 41.2% in 1979 to 45.9% in 1982 but fell back to 44.2% in 1986. The share of total tax receipts to GDP increased during the same period from 38% to 40.9%. Ronald Reagan's fiscal policy consisted in keeping tax revenues about constant in relation to GDP from 1980 to 1986, but increasing government expenditure and especially the federal debt.    At the end of 1986 unemployment rates were 11.8% in the 12 countries of the European Community, 6.7% in the U.S. and 2.9% in Japan. My best guess is that high unemployment and low growth of employment in Europe are here to stay for many years, unless government expenditures and tax revenues are reduced and disincentives in the labor market are curtailed.    ---   Mr. Tullio was economic adviser at the European Commission in Brussels until the end of March 1987.    ---               GENERAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE                         (in percent)                   1960     1980     1985    1986    1960-86    EC*            32.3%    47.4%    51.5%   50.4%   +18.1%    USA            26.8%    33.1%    35.1%   35.3%   + 8.5%                    GOVERNMENT RECEIPTS**    EC*            32.2%    43.7%    46.7%   46.1%   +13.9%    USA            27.4%    31.9%    31.7%   31.9%   + 4.5%   *Eight EC countries   **Including social security contributions   Source: European Commission and Economic Reports of thePresident, various issues</TEXT></DOC>
