The coverage includesbasic research on solid-state, liquid, gas, and chemical lasers; components;nonlinear optics; spectroscopy of laser materials; ultrashort pulse generation;theoretical aspects of advanced lasers; and general laser theory. Laserapplications are listed under biological effects; communications systems;beam propagation; adaptive optics; computer technology; holography; laser-inducedchemical reactions; measurement of laser parameters; laser measurementapplications; laser-excited optical effects; laser spectroscopy; beam-targetinteraction; and plasma generation and diagnostics.</TEXT></DOC>
