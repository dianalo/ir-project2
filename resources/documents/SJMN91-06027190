The Mercury News sportswriters easily picked Cruisin with the Toozas No. 1, obviously admiring the all-nighter turned in by Raiders defensiveend John Matuszak in New Orleans before Super Bowl XV. But the readers,perhaps indicating the nation's more conservative mood in recent years, wentwith the bellhop put-on turned in by Niners Coach Bill Walsh before Super BowlXVI.;    The Mercury News' readers and writers also disagreed in a few otherareas.;    (check) At offensive tackle, the readers selected Art Shell andKeith Fahnhorst. The writers went with Shell and Dallas' Pat Donovan, a formerStanford player.;    (check) At defensive end, Raiders fans had their say,pairing Matuszak with the Niners' Charles Haley. The writers went with twoNiners: Fred Dean and Haley.;    (check) And the readers thought Denver's JohnElway, a former Stanford player, was a far bigger goat than Craig Morton, aformer Cal player. The readers picked Elway by almost a 3-to-1 margin. Thewriters picked Morton.;    The readers' favorite was no surprise, though. Thebiggest victory margin was at the quarterback position, where the Niners' JoeMontana beat second-place Ken Stabler of the Oakland Raiders 516-44.;    Theclosest battle was for the top spot among starting outside linebackers. TheNiners' Keena Turner edged the Raiders' Ted Hendricks 466-465.;    Anotherclose battle was at cornerback, where the Oakland Raiders' Willie Brown edgedanother Raiders player, Lester Hayes, 265-263, for the second spot behind theNiners' Eric Wright.;  HOW THE MERCURY NEWS PANEL OF SPORTSWRITERS VOTED;OFFENSE; Quarterback: Joe Montana (Niners) 8 votes; Center: Jim Otto (Raiders)6 votes; Guards: Gene Upshaw (Raiders) 8 votes and Randy Cross (Niners) 7votes; Tackles: Art Shell (Raiders) 8 votes and Pat Donovan (Dallas/Stanford)3 votes; Wide receivers: Jerry Rice (Niners) 8 votes, and Fred Biletnikoff(Raiders) 4 votes and Lynn Swann (Pittsburgh/San Mateo High) 4 votes; Runningback: Roger Craig (Niners) 8 votes; Fullback: Mark Van Eeghen (Raiders) 7votes; Tight end: Dave Casper (Raiders) 6 votes; Kicker: Ray Wersching(Niners) 8 votes; DEFENSE; Cornerbacks: Eric Wright (Niners) 6 votes andWillie Brown (Raiders) 6 votes; Strong safety: Carlton Williamson (Niners) 4votes; Free safety: Ronnie Lott (Niners) 7 votes; Inside linebackers: MattMillen (Raiders/Niners) 7 votes and Jack Reynolds (Niners) 8 votes; Outsidelinebackers: Ted Hendricks (Raiders) 8 votes and Keena Turner (Niners) 4votes; Defensive ends: Fred Dean (Niners) 7 votes and Charles Haley (Niners) 4votes; Nose guard/tackle: Michael Carter (Niners) 6 votes; Punter: Ray Guy(Raiders) 8 votes; MISCELLANEOUS; Coach: Bill Walsh (Niners) 7 votes; Team:1984 49ers, 5 votes; MVP: Joe Montana (Niners) 7 votes; Goats: Craig Morton(Denver/Cal) 5 votes; Moment: John Taylor's 10-yard reception with 34 secondsleft gives the 49ers a 20-16 win over Cincinnati in 1989, 5 votes; Antics:Raiders defensive end John Matuszak parties all night (and morning) in NewOrleans in 1981, 5 votes.; THE PANEL: Mercury News panel of sportswriters whohave covered at least one Super Bowl: Mike Antonucci, Ron Bergman, BudGeracie, Ric Bucher, Dan Hruby, Dave Payne, Mark Purdy and Mike Weaver.;  THEOFFENSE; Quarterback; (check) Joe Montana; Niners; 516 votes; Others: KenStabler 44, Jim Plunkett, 30, Matt Cavanaugh 1, George Blanda 1, Frank Albert1.; Center; (check) Jim Otto; Raiders; 347 Votes; Others: Fred Quillan 158,Dave Dalby 67, Randy Cross 7, Jesse Sapolu 7; Guard; (check) Randy Cross;Niners; 457 votes; Guard; (check) Gene Upshaw; Raiders; 429 votes; Others: GuyMcIntyre 188, George Buehler 37, Ed White 42, Blaine Nye 11, Bruce Collie 2,Mickey Marvin 1.; Tackle; (check) Art Shell; Raiders; 471 votes; Tackle;(check) Keith Fahnhorst; Niners; 349 votes; Others: Harris Barton 145, HenryLawrence 88, Pat Donovan 37, John Vella 29, Bubba Paris 7, Steve Wallace 1,Len Rohde 1, Otis Sistrunk 1, Bob St. Clair 1.; Wide receiver; (check) JerryRice; Niners; 495 votes; Wide receiver; (check) Fred Biletnikoff; Raiders; 215votes; Others: Lynn Swan 202, Dwight Clark 168, Cliff Branch 56, John Taylor7, Bill Miller 3.; Running back; (check) Roger Craig; Niners; 448 votes;Others: Clarence Davis 101, Wendell Tyler 27, Marcus Allen 4, O.J.
