Now it's time for the software at hand.andM;The Humor Processor is a joke-software system.andP;  That's not to say it's aworthless, yet harmless, Piece of crap, but rather that its overridingpurpose is to store and create brief oral narratives with climactic humoroustwists, which we commonly refer to as jokes.andM;The store and create sides of the program actually knife the overall systemdown the middle.andP;  When you boot up The Humor Processor, it automaticallykicks into its pre-loaded database of jokes.andP;  The database comes with about500 or so different jokes.andP;  You can sort through them four different ways: byjoke number (each joke in the database is assigned a number); by category(want a joke about lawyers, bang it in and it comes back with a bunch oflawyer jokes); by occasion (need a joke for that big business lunch, samedeal); and by key word or words or themes.andM;You can also just browse aimlessly through the jokes, scrolling your lifeaway.andP;  And, of course, you can edit and, more importantly, add jokes to thedatabase (either by typing them in one-by-one as you hear them or importingas many as you want from a quote-delimited ASCII file - Responsive Softwaresells extra databases as well).andM;Overall, this database side of The Humor Processor makes the entire packageworth the reasonable $49.95 retail price, especially if you pump up thevolume of the database (assign a summer intern to type several $3.99 gagbooks into an ASCII file) and get the total number of entries up to 2,000 orso (the more the merrier).andM;I think it would be an excellent little adjunct creative tool for thenine-to-five business writer - the PR flack writing the press release, thepublic affairs grunt writing the boss's speech, the VP writing the memo, thetrade-magazine hack writing about phones, etc.andP;  - who often needs an amusingaside, anecdote or allusion to jump start his or her work.andP;  Other business PCusers, like salespeople, supervisors, perhaps even customer-service reps,would find it useful too.andP;  It certainly would be a great way for sellers andother traditional business comedians to remember all the good jokes they hearat work - &quot;Hold on, Vinny, let me pop open this program ...andP;  okay, tell me...andP;  what do albino midgets and mopeds have in common?&quot;andM;However, justifying the other side of The Humor Processor - the creative side- is unfortunately more of a reach.andP;  This is th part that purports to helpteach you how to write your very own jokes.andM;Help is the key word in that carefully phrased sentence.andP;  The Humor Processordoes not (can not) write original punchlines for you.andP;  Nor does it make anysuch claims.andP;  Indeed, Responsive Software is quick to point this out (intheir excellent, understandable and funny user's guide), using the obvioussimile - it can't write punchlines just as a word processor can't write abook.andM;The name of this second part is, appropriately enough, the brainstormsection.andP;  Essentially, it helps one more effectively &quot;brainstorm&quot; throughsundry joke images within predetermined (somewhat limited) joke formulas.andM;There are 11 different joke formulas detailed and the basic concept of howThe Human Processor helps you turn those formulas into sidesplittingvignettes is pretty much the same throughout.andP;  So I'll take you through thefirst formula they present and you'll get a decent idea how the thing works.andM;They start out with perhaps the most basic joke formula - the exaggerationformat.andP;  Two variations are presented: the simple setup and detailed setup.andM;In the simple setup you first type some basic joke setup like: my girlfriendis so skinny that ...; the food here is so bad that ...; my mother-in-law isso fat that ...; etc.andP;  The detailed formula isn't much more complicated.andP;  Yousimply give the basic setup a little more direction, as in - my girlfriend isso skinny that every Christmas...andM;Sticking with the simple setup, and not thinking very hard, I typed &quot;my bossis so crazy that...&quot; into a setup window, whose purpose is to remind you ofyour original focus whilst you brainstorm (as it turned out, it was a badsetup choice on my part because both the subject - my boss - and theadjective - crazy - are so closely associated in my mind).andM;The next step is to brainstorm images concerning the subject into a list thatsits on the left-hand side of your CRT, in this case images of a boss -random, likes to yell and scream, has goofy hair, beady eyes, droolsoccasionally, farts frequently, puppy dog at heart, etc.andP;  (Tired and a littlebored at this point, my brainstorming was actually more like uvulafogging.)andO;You then do the same thing for the adjective of the setup and that list sitson the right-hand side of the screen.andM;Then it's time to flip through the images, letting the combinations help youthink of a joke.andP;  Flipping through the images refers to changing the displayfrom one set of images to another.andP;  You can tweak the flipping action severaldifferent ways: random (the images are combined in random order); self-paced(the images change when you want them to); timed (the computer automaticallyflips them at a specified rate); and set delay (lets you set the timeinterval between flips).andP;  You can also flip only the right-hand or only theleft-hand images if you want.andM;When a combination of images,  along  with  your omnipresent setup, sparkssomething deep within your dormant funny bone, you bang a key and it's allsent to the database where you can review it later and perhaps turn it intoan amusing nugget.andP;  For instance, I saved the combination of &quot;excitable&quot;(boss image) and &quot;wets pants&quot; (crazy image) and came up with the incrediblylame, &quot;My boss is so crazy that when he gets excited he pee-pees ineverybody's pants!&quot; (which, as I found out later, is not only a qualifier forthe exaggeration joke formula but also the reversal format mentioned a fewpages later in the manual).andM;Anyway, that's the way it pretty much went for me in The Humor Processor'sbrainstorming section.andP;  The only things I could come up with, it seemed, wereeither ridiculously sophomoric, just-plain-nasty or crudely twisted.andP;  But, iftruth be told, I lost most of my interest in this section after a very shorttime.andM;Three problems.andM;First, the formats, for the most part, all ran towards the traditionalone-liner-gag sort of thing.andP;  Which is fine if you aspire to be the next JoeyAdams or Maury Amsterdam, but my taste runs more towards George Carlin andpre-fire Richard Pryor, both of whom possess comic processes that could neverbe duplicated by a software program, I'm afraid.andP;  This isn't The HumorProcessor's problem, of course.andP;  But unless you're the type who's inclined tothis type of humor, it's going to quickly bore you too, I think.andM;Second, I guess I was just expecting more from The Human Processor.andP;  Iactually envisioned a program that could write original punchlines.andP;  So whenthe reality set in, I felt a little disappointed.andP;  This, too, shouldn't beheld against Responsive Software.andP;  It wasn't their fault that their programwas reviewed by a writer who's lazy and stupid enough to actually wish hisword processor could write his novel.andM;Last, though the software does organize and perhaps facilitate brainstorming,I think the people who could actually build a funny joke out of the presentedformulas - funny people, basically - could probably do it without all theextra fuss.andP;  In fact, for &quot;funny&quot; people, it might even hinder the comicprocess - a process that is essentially an inherent and instinctive one thatis very difficult to pin down, organize and analyze.andM;Furthermore, there's something about the systematic breakdown of humor thatactually rubs most funny bones the wrong way.andP;  It kills the spontaneity.andO;Builds unsettling, unproductive pressures.andP;  And it's definitely tedious.andO;Thus, I think more than a few people who play with the brainstorming sectionof The Humor Processor will find themselves disappointed with the results, feeling restrained, depressed and decidedly unfunny, rather than creativelycomical.andM;Don't believe me? Well, listen to E.B.andP;  White - a certified funny person,among other things - who once said, &quot;Analyzing humor is like dissecting afrog.andP;  Few people are interested and the frog dies of it.&quot;andM;Great quote, isn't it? I found it in The Humor Processor's joke database(#34), which is, again, definitely the main strength of the overall program.andM;INTER-TEL'S FIRE PROTECTION !andP;  &quot;We installed an Inter-Tel GMX 48 in a localconstruction company office.andP;  A secretary left a cigarette burning on theedge of her desk and left the office.andP;  Cigarett, falls, starts fire.andM;&quot;However, the fire first burns, the line cord of her shiny new GMX telephone.andO;This sends an alarm, with the extension number, to the main receptionist'sdisplay Phone.andP;  Receptionist investigates, grabs a fire extinguisher andsaves the day.andM;&quot;Result: one very happy customer who loves his Inter-Tel GMX for more thanthe usual reasons.&quot;andM;Jim ware, sales manager, American Business Telephone Systems, Wheeling, IL</TEXT></DOC>
