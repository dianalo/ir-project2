Agency officials don't look for the supply crunch to bebig enough to trigger the 21-member agency's oil-sharingagreement, which would call for drawdowns of government oilstockpiles and other emergency measures, until late in thefourth quarter, if then.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We are going to have to watch the second half of thefourth quarter very carefully {when} we could face a markettightening and possibly the physical problem that the IEA wasdesigned to cope with,&quot; said George Quincy Lumsden Jr.,director of oil markets development.   The governing board of the Paris-based agency met Fridayto consider possible responses to the oil-supply situationcreated by global sanctions against Iraq, which have removedan estimated 4.3 million barrels of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudefrom world oil markets. After the meeting, as expected, theagency reported it had found oil markets are &quot;generally wellsupplied&quot; and that emergency-sharing measures aren't needednow.   &quot;Should the situation require it,&quot; the agency said, &quot;theIEA will immediately take whatever emergency action isneeded, including co-ordinated use of public andgovernment-controlled stocks and further demand restraint.&quot;   The agency cited several steps already being taken to helpmaintain a supply-demand balance in world oil markets. Itincluded the estimated 300,000 barrels a day of withdrawalsfrom commercial inventories in August and the expected higherrate for September.   More important, according to agency officials, was lastweek's action by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries that approved increased production by those OPECmembers with spare capacity. &quot;This will do much to replacesupplies removed from the market because of the embargo,&quot; theagency said.   OPEC's suspension of quotas officially endorses the outputincreases that had been launched by Saudi Arabia and severalother countries in the wake of the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwaitby Iraq. Already, production by Saudi Arabia is said to bemore than two million barrels a day higher than its formerOPEC quota of 5.4 million. The kingdom's output is believedto be near 7.5 million barrels a day and could, according tosome Saudi sources, reach as high as 8.5 million barrels aday, for brief periods, in a month or so if the marketrequires it.   Additionally, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates arewell on their way to adding a promised 500,000 barrels a dayeach to their output. And several other OPEC countries withsome spare capacity are stepping up production as quickly aspossible.   Nigeria's oil minister, Jibril Aminu, said yesterday thatoil companies in that nation are being directed to increaseproduction in line with the OPEC decision, according to theOPEC News Agency. At last week's Vienna OPEC meeting, he saidNigeria's production could be increased by 250,000 barrels aday.   The news agency said Mr. Aminu also urged meetings betweenOPEC and the IEA to develop common measures to stabilize oilmarkets. This followed similar calls last week by severalothers in OPEC, including Iran's oil minister, who introducedthe idea.   The other OPEC ministers didn't take any action on theIranian proposal. But in a statement issued after theirmeeting they did call for active participation byoil-consuming nations. They recommended that the IEA executeits oil-sharing agreement, which they said &quot;was specificallydesigned to meet eventualities such as the presentsituation.&quot; Also, they urged that the &quot;present hugeaccumulation&quot; of oil-company inventories be used.   Yesterday, Diego Tamariz, Ecuador's oil minister,explained why OPEC considers cooperation by the consumingnations, in drawing down their inventories, to be vitallynecessary for stable oil markets at this time. Much of theadditional crude to be produced by Saudi Arabia, Venezuelaand others is heavier -- or more dense -- than the oil it isreplacing, he said. Some refiners will have difficultyprocessing it. Also, these crudes yield much less of the moredesired fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel. Many of theconsuming nations' stockpiles, mainly those held by oilcompanies, include lighter crudes. &quot;So that's why theconsumers were asked to help,&quot; he said.   While IEA officials ruled out use of the emergency programat this time, Helga Steeg, the agency's executive director,said she had sent a message to OPEC Secretary-General Subrotoexpressing appreciation for the decision to increase output.She reiterated the IEA's opposition to any formal contactbetween it and OPEC, although other officials said informalcontacts continue.   The IEA officials said they will continue to monitoroil-market developments closely to determine if additionalmeasures are necessary and that the governing board plans tomeet again Sept. 28. Meanwhile, the IEA reported in itsstatement, &quot;the immediate supply-demand situation ismanageable, given high stock levels and expected increases inproduction.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
