 S/DMS TransportNodeoffers 2.488Gbps inter-exchange and local transport and provides managementof the high capacity SONET bandwidth.andP;  Once installed, S/DMS will supporttransmission of 450,000 simultaneous telephone conversations on one fibre,with a single fibre pair &quot;survivable&quot; ring configuration for long distance,local and metropolitan area networks.andP;  It will also support systemsdelivering 4.976Gbps capacity using optical multiplexing.andP;  The demonstrationshowed S/DMS TransportNode transporting full-motion, full-colour digitalvideo over fibre optic cable with the DV-45 Digital Video Codec, another newNorthern Telecom product.andP;  MCI Communcations Corp will be the first to testS/DMS TransportNode at OC-12, an Optical Carrier rate of 622Mbps, to carryhigh-volume data between its Reston and Pentagon City, Virginia, computercentres.andP;  MCI has also announced plans to use SONET in its network, and BellAtlantic Corp, Contel and United Telephone have also committed to firstapplication testing in 1990.andM;adds Dialan Plus local network...andM;Dialan Plus, a local area network-based service for the DMS-100 and DMSSuperNode has been designed to improve an end user's host computer efficiencyand information security and so save telephone operators money by simplifyingmaintenance and provisioning procedures.andP;  The Dialan Plus features werejointly developed by Northern Telecom, integrated voice data module vendorsand telephone companies.andP;  The development of a direct RS422 interface onintegrated voice and data modules is intended to eliminate the need forexpensive converter cables and patch panels between data module vendors andthe main distribution frame located in the switch.andP;  Northern also claims theRS422 interface reduces usage costs and simplifies the installation procedureand training requirements because Dialan lines and voice lines are nowprovisioned identically, while all testing and diagnostics can be performedfrom one terminal.andP;  Dialan Plus also enables the switching system to drop aconnection automatically if no data is sent after a time period specified bythe user for each digital line - without this feature, idle lines can be tiedup indefinitely because network operators cannot detect modem traffic.andO;Closed User Groups restrict access into or out of a customer-defined usergroup: within the DMS system each line is assigned a unique identifier and alist of other identifiers to which that line is permitted to connect; theDMS-100 determines whether the User Group identifier of the originator anddestination are compatible before completing the call.andP;  Dialan Plus will beavailable from telephone companies under various marketing names; integratedvoice data modules, available from a number of vendors, connect the computerto a telephone jack for digital, 19.2Kbps transmission via the telephonenetwork.andP;  Dialan Plus also supports simultaneous voice conversation over thesame pair of wires using existing telephone handsets.andM;adds enhanced Caller ID features...andM;Paying little heed to the continuing controversy surrounding calleridentification, a telephony feature that displays the number of the caller tothe party called - and which, according to some, is an erosion of privacy -Northern Telecom Ltd has come up with an add-on unit for use with standardtelephones that allows Caller ID information to be viewed and used moreeffectively.andP;  The Lumina 100, part of Northern Telecom's Custom Local AreaSignalling Services (CI No 1,347), can store up to 14 different callingnumbers along with the date and time of each call, displaying whether thecall is new or repeated, whether the call comes from an area not equipped forcalling number delivery, and whether the call information has previously beendisplayed during a review of the caller's list; the caller information isdisplayed between the first and second rings.andP;  For those living in the sixstates served by Bell Atlantic - the only network operator so far to supportCaller ID - the suggested list price for the Lumina 100 system is $69.andM;offers operators free ISDN upgrade...andM;To help its telephone operating company customers offer integrated servicesdigital network services, Northern Telecom has announced a free switchupgrade programme that establishes standard ISDN Basic Rate service from itsDMS-100 and DMS SuperNode central exchange switching systems.andP;  The programmecalls for Northern Telecom to replace, at no charge, all non-standard AMIAlternate Mark Invers-ion equipment with equipment that conforms to theindustry-standard for basic rate ISDN.andP;  The company will also provide fullcredit for inventories of Northern Telecom NT1s Network Termination devicesand line cards, and all ISDN switches that have shipped by January 1 1991 arecovered by the offer.andP;  Northern Telecom claims that by upgrading DMS-100s andDMS SuperNodes to the standard basic rate ISDN 2B1Q standard, telephonecompany customers will be able to buy any U-interface ISDN terminal,including Northern Telecom's NT1, without fear of obsolescence due to futurestandards incompatibility.andM;and adds Centrex support to NorstarandM;Northern has also introduced Meridian Norstar Centrex, a software enhancementto the digital key telephone system that gives Norstar users one-buttonaccess to such Centrex features as call forwarding, call pick-up, callwaiting, re-dial, three-way conferencing, and a liquid crystal displayinstruction panel.andP;  Norstar Centrex also has an &quot;extension&quot; key combiningline and intercom key functions, so that users can dial internal or externalcalls transparently.andP;  Industry standard telephones, like 1A2 and single-linesets, can be monitored for &quot;busy&quot;, &quot;ring&quot;, and &quot;idle&quot; status from a Norstartelephone running the Norstar Centrex software.andP;  Norstar Centrex is availableon the modular version of Meridian Norstar, the small business telephonesystem introduced by the Canadian manufacturer in March 1988.andP;
