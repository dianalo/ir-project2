Michael Dukakis rode anendorsement by Hawaii's top elected Democrats to a narrow victoryover Jesse Jackson in a presidential preference poll at the state'sDemocratic Party caucuses.   With all but about a dozen of 283 precincts reporting, Dukakishad 2,026 votes, while Jackson had 1,470. None of the othercandidates or the choice of ``uncommitted'' had enough votes toqualify for any of the state's 20 pledged delegates to theDemocratic National Convention.   Party officials were analyzing the results today to determinethe allocation of the pledged delegates, but it appeared Dukakiswould get 12 delegates and Jackson 8.   In endorsing Dukakis, Gov. John Waihee was joined by Sens.Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, Rep. Daniel Akaka, Lt. Gov.Benjamin Cayetano, and the mayors of Hawaii and Kauai islands.   Waihee said he was not surprised by Jackson's strong showing andsaid it was ``healthy for the Democratic Party.''   Jackson supporters signed up about 2,000 new party members priorto the caucuses.   The Jackson campaign claimed victory with their strong showingagainst the endorsement of the Democratic establishment.   ``Jackson's showing in Hawaii puts an end to the belief thatJesse Jackson is not electable, and to the belief that Jackson canwin only in states with large black populations,'' said RichardPort, manager of the Jackson campaign in Hawaii.   The votes of other candidates were Richard Gephardt, 83; PaulSimon, 46; Albert Gore, 41; Gary Hart, 83; and ``uncommitted,'' 183.</TEXT></DOC>
