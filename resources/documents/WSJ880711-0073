Karr (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><G> JUS </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The death of Teamsters President Jackie Presser will speed up a battle for leadership of the huge union, which is engaged currently in crucial legal and economic struggles.    But Weldon Mathis, the union's secretary-treasurer who has been serving as acting president since Mr. Presser gave up the reins for what was to be a temporary period, is considered to have a clear lead for becoming the next Teamsters president.    Mr. Presser, who was 61 years old, died of heart failure Saturday at suburban Cleveland's Lakewood Hospital. He had suffered from lung cancer, and more recently, brain cancer, and also underwent open-heart surgery in 1985. His health had deteriorated in recent months, forcing him on May 4 to relinquish control of the Teamsters union for four months.    Mr. Presser's death isn't likely to affect the Justice Department's effort to oust many of the union's top officials, which had included Mr. Presser, and to seek replacement of any local Teamsters leaders found to be corrupt. The department's suit was filed when his seriously ill health was well known and deals with much more than his presidency, alleging that the union's entire 18-member board has deprived 1.6 million Teamsters of their rights by allowing organized crime to corrupt the union.    The Justice Department action also named as defendants 26 individual members of the Commission of La Cosa Nostra, the department's name for the Mafia, a federal official involved in the investigation noted. &quot;It's not just the {one} man,&quot; he said.    Jockeying to succeed Mr. Presser is expected to intensify immediately among the remaining 17 members of the union's general executive board. That struggle has been under way for more than two months among at least several board members. &quot;I suppose there's a lot of people vying for the job; you can pretty much cover the board,&quot; one Teamsters official said.    Among those who have recently been mentioned as having a good shot at the post are Walter Shea, a Teamsters vice president at the union headquarters here who oversees organizing and contract bargaining. Another is William McCarthy, a vice president in Boston who has become a union dissident, openly opposing the recent master freight agreement with trucking companies. That pact drew a 64% negative vote by the union's trucker rank-and-file, but the leadership declared it ratified, anyway, because it didn't get a two-thirds vote for rejection.    Under the Teamsters constitution, the secretary-treasurer temporarily assumes the union presidency on the president's death and has 15 days to convene the board to pick a new president. Mr. Mathis is considered likely to adhere to that scenario, though his reign as acting president could be argued to run until early September. At a recent Teamsters board meeting in Montreal, Mr. Mathis was said to have sought, unsuccessfully, board action to pick Mr. Presser's successor at that time.    Mr. Mathis is a good bet to gain board backing to be that successor. &quot;It looks like he has the votes,&quot; said Kenneth Paff, national organizing director for Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a Detroit-based group of dissident Teamsters members. A Teamsters official called Mr. Mathis &quot;the odds-on favorite&quot; to become president.    Mr. Mathis has generally been regarded as free of the racketeering ties that the Justice Department and other Teamsters critics cite in relation to many of the union's past and current officials. But the department's suit alleged that Mr. Mathis, as a Teamsters official, had illegally received &quot;things of value&quot; intended to influence his actions relating to union members' employee-benefit welfare plans.    Mr. Mathis is also a subject of a Labor Department investigation of alleged irregularities involving his re-election as president of a Teamsters local in Atlanta and the re-election of other local officers there. John Climaco, the Teamsters' general counsel, said the influence charges involving Mr. Mathis and employee-benefit welfare plans are &quot;completely untrue.&quot; He also noted that Mr. Mathis has resigned as president of the Atlanta local, suggesting that investigation has become moot.    Mr. Mathis is expected to benefit from arguments that the union needs leadership stability at a time when it is beset by so many problems. Besides the Justice Department suit, the union is under heavy fire from its rank-and-file for what many regard as a weak trucking contract, including work-rule concessions, modest pay increases and encouragement for worker wage &quot;givebacks&quot; to financially distressed trucking companies.    Mr. Mathis has been working closely with Mr. Climaco, who also was Mr. Presser's attorney in a federal trial in Cleveland, defending charges that Mr. Presser embezzled funds of Teamsters Local 507, where he was secretary-treasurer. Mr. Climaco is said to have built something of a power base in the union himself, especially by skillfully delaying the government's Cleveland case against Mr. Presser and by becoming an expert in the racketeering law that the Justice Department is using to sue the union.    Mr. Mathis also had Mr. Presser's blessing, and that of the board, to be Mr. Presser's successor. And when Mr. Presser named him secretary-treasurer in 1985, the Federal Bureau of Investigation backed that selection, a Teamsters official said. Mr. Presser was himself an FBI informant at the time. Now, Mr. Mathis &quot;will continue the movement to . . . permanently and completely clean up the Teamsters,&quot; the official said.    Mr. Presser's death may give Mr. Mathis a stronger hand, some officials said. As long as the union's leadership was uncertain, &quot;I don't think he was in a position to do all he might want to do,&quot; a Teamsters official said.    Mr. Presser's Cleveland trial, on charges he had paid $700,000 in the local's money to &quot;ghost employees&quot; who didn't do any work, was recently postponed because of his poor health.    Mr. Presser took the Teamsters union back into the AFL-CIO last fall, 30 years after the labor federation ousted the union amid corruption scandals. The re-entry occurred as the Teamsters and other unions were closing ranks against the then-rumored takeover plan by the Justice Department.    Mr. Presser, the son of a Teamsters official who became a vice president of the union, worked his way up through union's ranks in Cleveland. He became Teamsters president in 1983, pledging to reform the union, after three of his four predecessors had been convicted while in office on labor-corruption or other criminal charges.    In a 1986 report, the White House Commission on Organized Crime said that Mr. Presser wouldn't have become Teamsters president without the help of Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno, head of the New York-based Genovese crime family. Mr. Presser always denied ties with the mob. Last May, Mr. Salerno and two co-defendants were acquitted on charges of rigging the elections of Mr. Presser and his predecessor, Roy Williams.    ---   Gregory Stricharchuk in Pittsburgh contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
