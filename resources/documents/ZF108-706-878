 PHASE ONE, Q4/90andM;A new trial of Raynet's fiber optic telephone system is about to be conductedby Telefonica, the Spanish telephone company.andM;The trial involves the testing of Raynet's Loop Optical Carrier (LOC) fiberoptic system.andP;  The first phases of the Raynet trial are designed to test thetechnological and economic feasibility of delivering conventional telephoneservice with fiber optic tech- nology rather than conventional copper.andM;Later phases of the trial will verify the Raynet approach in bringing cabletelevision and high-speed business services (ISDN and BISDN) to every homeand office.andM;The first two trial phases using the Raynet LOC System will test regularvoice-grade telephone service, commonly known as POTS (Plain Old TelephoneService).andP;  Phase one will begin in the fourth quarter of 1990, with the LOCsystem being installed in a neigh- borhood of approximately 100 homes inMadrid, Spain.andM;According to Raynet, Madrid customers will not notice any change in theirservice, except for perhaps an improvement in signal quality with the newsystem.andM;During phase two, Telefonica will test Raynet's system for enhanced servicesand for volume deployment in the telephone net- work.andP;  The second stage ofthe trial will be implemented during the fourth quarter 1991.andM;In subsequent phases, Telefonica will also evaluate the Raynet LOC system forits upgrade capabilities.andP;  Raynet's LOC system is designed to provide cabletelevision (AM video), as well as high speed data communications (IntegratedServices Digital Network, or ISDN) and broadband ISDN (BISDN) when theseservices become avail- able.andM;The Raynet system provides many passive optical network (PON) deploymentoptions, including a bus topology utilizing Raynet's non-invasive opticalcoupler, as well as splitter-based layouts.andP;  These multiple cable deploymentoptions permit a high degree of flexibility and resource sharing in theoutside plant.andM;Telefonica is planning to carry out several trials with differenttechnologies to test the feasibility of using optical fiber to re- placeconventional copper wires connecting telephone subscribers to telephoneexchanges.andP;  The Raynet trial is one of these trials.andM;The Raynet trial with Telefonica is one of a series now being un- dertaken byRaynet in the United States and Europe.andP;  It follows closely after Raynet'sannouncement that it had completed the in- stallation of a shared resourcecable TV/telephone system for the Deutsche Bundespost in the Cologne area inWest Germany.andM;LOC SYSTEM BACKGROUND Raynet's LOC system is said to be the world's firstfiber optic transmission system that is a cost-effective replacement for cop-per wire in the &quot;local loop&quot; of the telephone network which con- nectsindividual subscribers with telephone central offices.andM;Optical fiber is superior to copper wire because it can carry far moreconversations or video or data traffic, and it is more reli- able.andP;  UntilRaynet introduced the LOC system, however, bringing optical fiber to mosthome and business telephone subscribers was too expensive, because itrequired installing expensive lasers and optical receivers at each subscriberlocation.andM;In addition, conventional technology required costly and difficult splicingof hair-thin optical fibers for each subscriber connec- tion.andM;The LOC system overcomes these obstacles with a resource-sharing architectureand a unique fiber optic coupler.andP;  The resource- sharing architecture bringsfiber cabling to the curb outside a subscriber location, and allows the useof existing copper drop wires to complete the run to a home or office.andM;Eight phone lines can currently share one optical receiver and transmitter,so the cost of expensive electronics is distributed among severalsubscribers.andP;  (A LOC system can support up to 384 telephone subscribers overjust a few pairs of fibers.)andP;  Raynet's system also reduces installationcosts, because the company's non-invasive optical coupler allows subscriberhookups to the fiber cable without splicing.andM;The Raynet system enables several deployment options, including a bustopology utilizing Raynet's non-invasive optical coupler; a splitter-based,passive optical network (PON) layout; or a com- bination of both.andP;  Thesemultiple cable deployment options permit a high degree of flexibility andresource-sharing in the outside plant planning process.andM;The immediate use of the LOC system will be to carry telephone service.andO;Operations support software makes the LOC system im- mediately compatiblewith existing telephone provisioning and sup- port systems.andM;Because fiber is so well suited to digital signal transmission, however, theLOC system will also support Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)services as they become available within the next few years.andM;In addition, the modular design and high capacity of the system's fiber willenable it to deliver enhanced services, such as AM video, high speed datatransmission, and (when demand develops) SONET-based 622 megabit per secondbroadband ISDN (BISDN).andM;This upgrade to full BISDN is accomplished by the addition of a passivelycoupled fiber and accompanying electronics all the way to the subscriber'sresidence.andM;U.S.andP;  TRIALS Field trials of the LOC system for both telephone and cabletelevision service are currently underway.andP;  In the United States, NYNEX Corp.andO;and New England Telephone Co. are conducting the world's first trial of ashared resource fiber distribution sys- tem, serving some 100 homes inLynnfield, MA, with a Raynet LOC system.andM;Ameritech and its Ohio Bell operating company are scheduled to begin a Raynettrial, initially involving 72 homes, this spring in Columbus, OH.andP;  OtherUnited States trials are planned for this year.andM;In Cologne, West Germany, a Raynet system has been installed to distributeboth telephone and cable television signals to a com- munity of about 200subscribers.andP;  The trial is being conducted by the Deutsche BundespostTelekom, the government agency that ad- ministers both telephone and cabletelevision service for West Germany.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
