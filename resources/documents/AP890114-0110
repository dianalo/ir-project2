The deaths brought to four the number of young Arabs killed byarmy gunfire in two days and raised to 355 the number ofPalestinians killed in the 13-month-old uprising in the West Bankand Gaza Strip. Fifteen Israelis have died.   In annexed east Jerusalem, police fired tear gas to disperse Arabstone-throwers. Israel radio said authorities safely dismantled abomb left at a major road junction near the city.   In east Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital, 14-year-old Rana Al-Masridied of wounds suffered in a Jan. 7 clash in the West Bank city ofNablus, the army said. Arab reports said she was shot in the headwith a plastic bullet.   Residents in Nablus called a strike to mourn the girl's death,and Arab students left schools to march in protest of the killing,an Arab reporter in the city said.   Arab hospital officials reported 16 Palestinians wounded inclashes with troops Saturday in the West Bank cities of Rafah andNablus and in the Gaza Strip. The army confirmed seven wounded inthose areas, plus three in the West Bank city of Bethlehem.   Most of the wounded were teen-agers.   A 12-year-old Palestinian girl, Hanadi Abu-Sultan, died at theTel Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv after troops shot her in thehead in a Jan. 10 clash at the Shati refugee camp in Gaza Strip, themilitary command said.   On Friday, two 15-year-old Palestinians died after being shot bytroops in clashes.   The army, in an apparent effort to prevent disturbances, clampeda curfew on Shati, a beachside shantytown in Gaza City housing about42,000 Palestinians.   Curfews were also imposed on Rafah, Deir el-Balah and Nuseiratcamps, which have a combined population of almost 100,000.   But Palestinian protests, sparked by the death of Ms. Abu-Sultanand another Gaza teenager a day before, erupted in many areas of thesouthern strip.   Merchants in Gaza continued a commercial strike begun Friday toprotest Israeli raids to collect taxes. Non-payment of taxes is amajor tactic of the revolt against Israeli occupation.   Also Saturday, a senior Israeli defense official, Uri Lubrani,said the PLO has not conducted any attacks against northern Israelor Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in Lebanon since PLOchairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism.   The zone is a 6- to 10-mile-wide strip along the border thatIsrael created in 1985. It is patrolled by a small contingent ofIsraeli forces and the allied South Lebanon Army militia.   Palestine Liberation Organization groups have staged attacks ontroops and militiamen patrolling the zone, fired rockets at Israel'snorthern settlements or attempted to infiltrate Israel onhostage-taking operations.   Lubrani, coordinator of Israeli actions in Lebanon, said thehostilities have stopped since Arafat last month renounced terrorismand recognized Israel's right to exist.   But Lubrani said he could not yet assess the PLO position.   ``I think it is too early to judge, and time will say,'' he saidon Israel radio. ``At the moment, they are leaning somehow toward astatus quo, no violent actions. But how long this will last I cannottell you. This can last until tonight.''</TEXT></DOC>
