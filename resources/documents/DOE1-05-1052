Initialevaluation of the failed tank showed a crack existed in the girth weld,for several years. The preliminary conclusion of this investigation wasthat the crack condition was the cause of failure; however, the authorssuggested that a fracture mechanics analysis be conducted. Four compactfracture toughness specimens were fabricated from weld metal in the tankand tested. It was shown that the failure could not have occurred fromthe existing crack and the tank internal pressure, unless the internalpressure far exceeded the maximum allowable 1.72 MPa (250 psi) pressure.Further investigations led to the discovery that the relief valve ofthe tank was corroded so badly that it would not open, thus allowingexcessive pressure in the tank. There was evidence that the driver hadoverfilled the tank. Heat from the sun and from the hot truck tailpipecaused the tank to become liquid full. Then, the pressure exceeded 6.9MPa (1000 psi), causing the tank to explode. The fracture mechanics analysisthus showed that the explosion was not due only to the existing crack,but also to the stopped-up relief valve and excessive liquid propanein the tank.</TEXT></DOC>
