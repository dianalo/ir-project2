Pinola, then the head of the North America division, proposed to curb loans to Mexico the following year. But A.W. Clausen, the chief executive officer who had made BankAmerica a familiar name around the globe, took strong exception, countermanding Mr. Pinola's plan in front of all the other executives.    Such behavior wasn't unusual for the autocratic and often merciless Mr. Clausen, but Mr. Pinola, who had been at the bank for 23 years, thought it &quot;unnecessarily brutal,&quot; a BankAmerica official says. Fed up, Mr. Pinola quit a few weeks later, jumping to what is now First Interstate Bancorp, where he currently sits as chairman and chief executive officer.    Now, the two men are at it again, as First Interstate and Mr. Pinola press a bold plan to acquire BankAmerica, the nation's second-largest bank, for securities valued by First Interstate at $3.23 billion, almost three times the largest sum ever paid for a bank. After a long silence, BankAmerica recently denounced the offer, and Mr. Clausen is putting up an increasingly bitter and personal defense. But Mr. Pinola is disregarding his old boss, and the companies, which were once under common ownership, are edging toward the first hostile takeover fight involving major U.S. financial institutions.    A First Interstate victory, which would undoubtedly lead to Mr. Clausen's ouster, would be sweet revenge for Mr. Pinola. For one thing, he was right about Mexico, which has caused BankAmerica grievous losses. (Mr. Clausen declines comment.) But the issue involves more than just personalities. Like a growing number of bankers, Mr. Pinola is trying to capture the advantages of merging banks within the same states, not unlike the hugely successful merger of two California rivals, Wells Fargo andamp; Co. and Crocker National Corp., last May.    By combining Los Angeles-based First Interstate and San Francisco-based BankAmerica, Mr. Pinola believes that he can eliminate as much as $695 million of annual costs, mainly by dropping redundant operations, and that he would be left with a lean core that would dominate banking in California and the West.    First Interstate currently has about 325 branches in California, a poor fourth compared with competitors, but the merger would make it an instant leader, with a huge share of the nation's most lucrative retail banking market. BankAmerica has more than 900 California branches. Mr. Pinola thinks the resulting company could earn more than $1 billion by 1990.    In a way, the takeover bid is ironic because First Interstate is built on the promise of interstate banking more than any other U.S. financial institution. But a growing number of bankers, including Mr. Pinola himself, are finding that the purported rewards have been exaggerated.    Although a few big First Interstate banks are among the best in the West, several smaller ones are deeply troubled. The company has shown some dreadfully poor timing in its past acquisitions, and a heavily promoted plan to franchise banks like fast-food joints has stalled. First Interstate has also had trouble containing expenses, leading some analysts to question its promise to slash BankAmerica's.    First Interstate's operating record, although far better than BankAmerica's, is becoming a critical issue as the companies edge toward war. Already, Mr. Clausen has questioned the competence of Mr. Pinola and his senior management team, ironically dominated by former BankAmerica workers. A high-ranking federal regulator says the management issue concerns the Federal Reserve Board, which has the power to block the merger.    Other observers are starting to wonder about Mr. Pinola's judgment. Being so eager to take on BankAmerica's still-huge problems is &quot;crazy,&quot; says the chief executive of a West Coast competitor. Many bank experts believe that BankAmerica's problem loans will cripple it for years.    But Mr. Pinola, who has been stalking BankAmerica for more than a year and recently has been reading a book on hostile takeovers, is apparently intent on writing the next chapter. Criticism may only increase his desire. Recently, few things have riled him more than when a bank analyst suggested that he was a little out of his league in taking on BankAmerica, which is twice as big as First Interstate.    &quot;Two things you don't call Joe Pinola,&quot; says Paul Minch, First Interstate's senior vice president for corporate communications. &quot;One's an amateur; the other's a wimp.&quot;    The determined son of a West Pittston, Pa., machinist, Mr. Pinola is unusually aggressive for a banker. Broad-shouldered and measured in speech, he personally dominates First Interstate, although, like the football coach he is forever compared with, he tends to chart a game plan and then let others run the plays.    In fact, he played basketball while studying economics at Wilkes College in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. At one time, Mr. Pinola wanted to be a lawyer -- an uncle was a prominent judge -- but law school cost too much. After college, the Navy called, for a second time, landing him in Southern California after the Korean War. He never left, and for years he lived modestly in Long Beach, married to his high-school sweetheart. A newspaper ad got him started at BankAmerica.    At First Interstate, aides tend to be in their 30s and early 40s, cocksure former BankAmerica employees, who, like the 61-year-old Mr. Pinola, left because they felt under-utilized. The alumni include William Siart, rescued from the Brussels office and now the chief executive of First Interstate's California bank unit, and Donald Griffith, a former energy lender at BankAmerica and now First Interstate's chief financial officer. &quot;Joe gave us all a quantum leap in responsibilities,&quot; says Bruce Willison, the chief executive of the Oregon bank unit, who once worked for BankAmerica in Mexico. Some appreciate his readiness to act. &quot;He doesn't study things to death,&quot; Mr. Siart says.    A demanding boss, Mr. Pinola nonetheless tries hard to be reasonable and to avoid what he considers Mr. Clausen's faults. Mr. Pinola thinks that &quot;you could be tough on people without being insulting,&quot; a BankAmerica official says. The official remembers how Mr. Pinola, while the North America division chief, persuaded him to accept an unwanted New York assignment on the promise of a choice spot in Texas later. Although Mr. Pinola left shortly afterward, he left behind word of the promise, and the official eventually made it to Texas. Such gestures generate intense loyalty.    But Mr. Pinola doesn't seem to handle defectors very well. Years ago, he was peeved when his new son-in-law left First Interstate to work for a bank executive whom Mr. Pinola beat out to become chief executive. &quot;Joe didn't talk to him for a long, long time,&quot; says a man familiar with the incident. &quot;He viewed it as a personal betrayal, thought it made him look bad.&quot;    In his current proposal, Mr. Pinola, who became a banker when a department store didn't consider him management material, hopes to resurrect the dream of the most prominent name in California banking. A.P. Giannini founded BankAmerica as well as the Transamerica Corp., which owned some of First Interstate's current banks, with the goal of developing a powerful nationwide banking system. But regulatory and congressional action forced the dismantling of Transamerica, and the dream fell short. As its current name implies, First Interstate got a head start in the race to operate across state lines; it was grandfathered from a 1956 federal law banning the practice.    Taking charge of what was then called Western Bancorp. in 1978, Mr. Pinola is credited with uniting a loose confederation of banks, all originally with different names, ranging from Los Angeles to whistlestops in Gallup, N.M., and Great Falls, Mont. He cleaned house, eventually replacing top management at all the bigger banks. At the California unit, for example, his promotion of Mr. Siart unseated the son of a longtime Western chief executive, who remained chairman for a while but later left.    In a further unification move, Mr. Pinola spent $20 million on new marquees and stationery to give the banks a common name -- First Interstate. The local bankers feared the switch would devastate business by confusing customers and wiping out hard-won good will; in Utah, the oldest name in banking west of the Mississippi vanished. Some officials of the parent also fretted that the public would confuse the company with a motor-freight carrier.    But Mr. Pinola cultivated what he calls &quot;The Territory&quot; with an aggressive marketing and public-relations drive. Now, First Interstate boasts the country's largest retail banking organization &quot;covering more than half the U.S. landmass,&quot; thanks to operations in Alaska and California. In television ads, it trumpets the customer convenience of its 1,100 offices. It further spreads its name through a franchise program that plays on the fears of small banks concerned about surviving financial deregulation. Typical advertising features a satisfied-looking alligator asking, &quot;Guess what's happened to more than 50 of Florida's banks?&quot;    For First Interstate itself, according to Mr. Pinola, the resulting earnings have been &quot;certainly satisfactory&quot; but &quot;not outstanding.&quot;    Profitability, based upon return on assets, of First Interstate banks in Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington exceeds an enviable 1%, reflecting huge market shares. The top-performing Nevada bank has more than half the state's consumer deposits. &quot;It's tough to compete; as a matter of fact, at times I don't even think I do,&quot; says William E. Martin, the chairman of Reno-based Nevada National Bancorp.    Earnings of First Interstate's flagship California bank, the state's fourth-largest, increased 26% last year, and Mr. Siart, its chief executive, expects further gains. In terms of return on assets, he says First Interstate intends to &quot;make a one&quot; in each of its states, an achievement that potential national competitors would be hard-pressed to match. &quot;We are in 18 states,&quot; he says. &quot;The question is whether they will catch us.&quot;    However, the results of 14 banks in the Rocky Mountains, constituting about 8% of First Interstate's assets, have spiraled downward for three years because of the collapse in oil and farm prices; the group lost $6.8 million last year. The former Denver-based IntraWest Bank, a major energy lender that First Interstate acquired three months before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' first-ever price cut, is marginally profitable in its fourth year in the fold. The franchise program, which signed up two new banks last year compared with 14 in 1985, is little more than breaking even after four years; small banks have proved more resistant to national alliances than Mr. Pinola expected.    Costly upkeep for First Interstate's far-flung offices has further depressed earnings. Though the pace eased somewhat last year, First Interstate's expenses have risen at nearly double Wells Fargo's rate since 1980. First Interstate hopes to emulate Wells Fargo's dismantling of Crocker if it acquires BankAmerica, but &quot;Wells Fargo has a history of cost-cutting that First Interstate lacks,&quot; says Mark Alpert, a bank analyst at Bear Stearns andamp; Co.    In fact, profits have grown more slowly in recent years at First Interstate than at either Wells Fargo or Security Pacific Corp., its other California rival. First Interstate's return on assets remains below the 1980 level, while Wells Fargo's return has increased sharply and Security Pacific's has been about flat.    Last year, First Interstate's earnings rose 8%, but they would have declined without a $50 million special gain from refinancing its pension plan. Profits rose 20% at Security Pacific and 44% at Wells Fargo. First Interstate's record on loan losses is the best in California, but last year its losses jumped 28%.    Despite the TV ads that tout the pleasures of cashing checks while traveling, there is little hard evidence that most consumers need an interstate bank. In addition, First Interstate, while improving, still has trouble getting local bankers to push new services. Interstate banking's advantages, Mr. Pinola says, &quot;aren't there to the extent we thought.&quot;    Moreover, state barriers to interstate acquisitions are folding, posing new threats to First Interstate. Security Pacific, for example, recently acquired banks in four of First Interstate's best markets. More subtle warfare is emerging as well. When First Interstate tried to hire advertising help last year, three different agencies turned it down, deferring to existing clients -- Citicorp, Sears Roebuck and Beneficial Finance, which considered the applicant a threat.    &quot;They've lost their lead,&quot; says John A. Elorriaga, the chief executive of U.S. Bancorp, Oregon's largest bank, which recently expanded into Washington state. Adds a former BankAmerica colleague: &quot;Pinola knows there isn't much more he can do right now. He's just restless, restless for something big.&quot;    Indeed, Mr. Pinola, though denying that he is giving up on interstate banking, says acquiring BankAmerica is currently &quot;infinitely more attractive&quot; than pushing further across state lines.    To win, he will have to move fast. In an attempt to shore up its weakened finances, BankAmerica plans to raise up to $500 million in new capital next month. Some sources say regulators may pressure First Interstate to retreat if BankAmerica can raise the money, although First Interstate contends that the regulators' position is far from clear.    Moreover, the aggressive shrinkage of BankAmerica under Mr. Clausen is starting to make the Pinola camp wonder whether their offer of a package of securities valued at $21 a share is too high. In the fourth quarter alone, BankAmerica's assets shrank by nearly $10 billion to $104 billion, and the company now is roughly half the size of Citicorp. Until just before Mr. Clausen left the bank in 1981, it was the largest in the world.    Mr. Pinola is known to regard as mistakes both BankAmerica's recent sale of its Italian subsidiary and its plan to sell its Charles Schwab andamp; Co. discount brokerage subsidiary back to the unit's founder. Both units are highly profitable, and their divestitures raise the possibility that Mr. Clausen is damaging the long-term profitability of BankAmerica for short-term gains designed to fend off Mr. Pinola.    Some merger experts now regard Mr. Pinola as a distinct underdog against Mr. Clausen, but friends and associates say he is determined as ever to press on. Already supported by institutions that hold about 30% of BankAmerica's stock, he will try to woo remaining shareholders, largely retired Californians, with a pledge to restore BankAmerica to its glory days and dividends to their pocketbooks.    BankAmerica is &quot;reduced in purpose and prestige&quot; because of the actions of current management, Mr. Pinola says. &quot;That is wrong for California.&quot;    But Mr. Clausen recently issued this warning about his former aide and the First Interstate team: &quot;In a way, we taught them everything they know. But we didn't teach them everything we know. If they insist on pushing this thing, they're going to find out.&quot;    --- First Interstate Under Pinola (Dollar amounts in millions of dollars)                1980   1981   1982   1983 1984   1985   1986 Return of average assets .76%    .71    .58    .61  .64    .67    .68 Net charge-offs   $92.0   88.9  170.0  204.1 215.5 313.2  402.4 Nonperforming assets       $217.0  402.0 1145.0 1221.0 1102.1 1249 1373.0 Non-interest expense      $946.6 1102.7 1253.9 1390.8 1654 1889.9 2045.4 Source: Montgomery Securities</TEXT></DOC>
