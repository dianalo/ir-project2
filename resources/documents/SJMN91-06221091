Finda frozen, lifeless planet such as Mars, which has an average surfacetemperature of about 60 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MARS SEEN AS ULTIMATE FIXER-UPPERPLANETARY MAKEOVER WOULD RE-CREATE EARTH  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     2. Trigger a greenhouse effect with black soot spread on the planet's polarcaps, gigantic mirrors to reflect the sunlight, or huge factories to pump tonsof atmospheric gases.;    3. Watch -- for between 100 and 100,000 years -- aswarming rocks release carbon dioxide, speeding the warming process andreleasing more gas in a runaway greenhouse cycle.;    4. Introduce plant lifeto turn the carbon dioxide into oxygen. Then, dilute the oxygen with, say,nitrogen so humans can breathe the air.;    5. Wait another 100,000 years and-- voila! -- we'll have another planet to call our very own.;    If the recipeis not exactly Popular Science, it's not exactly science fiction, either.;   The three scientists report in today's issue of the journal Nature that itmight be possible to &quot;terraform&quot; Mars -- to remake it in Earth's image so itis a hospitable environment for human life.;    &quot;If it is technically possibleto engineer the planet to be habitable for humans, I think that would be awonderful thing to do,&quot; said one of the authors, James Kasting, a former Amesresearcher now at Pennsylvania State University. &quot;It looks like it might bepossible to make Mars plant-habitable at the least.&quot;;    Why would we want tolive on Mars in the first place? These scientists and others hold a vision ofMars as the next conquest in humans' territorial expansion.;    &quot;Europeanssort of Euro-formed the Americas,&quot; said another of the paper's authors, BrianToon of Ames' Earth System Science Division. &quot;It's human nature to do thesethings, which leads me to think we will do it.&quot;;    The team's recipe for&quot;terraforming,&quot; though far from conclusive, is sure to fire an emergingphilosophical debate: Do humans have the right to transform another planet fortheir own purposes?;    Even his supporters call terraforming's chiefproponent, NASA/Ames' Christopher McKay, a zealot. McKay, the paper's leadauthor, couldn't be reached for comment because he's in Mongolia's Gobi Desertsearching for forms of life able to withstand harsh environments. Previously,McKay has found ancient organisms, still alive, trapped in ice in Siberia androcks in Antarctica.;    McKay's research is important because the discoveryof similar life on Mars, hidden in aquifers or deep caves, would probably putan end to plans to remake the planet's environment on a huge scale. But ifMars is dead, the Ames team thinks the prospect is nearly inevitable.;    Therobot exploration of Mars planned for the end of this decade and early in thenext century will lead to settlements there, Toon said. Climate-controlledbubbles will suffice at first, but eventually, humans will seek to transformthe planet's environment, Toon said.;    That vision of humans' manifestdestiny provoked a spirited debate at a meeting at Ames in June that wascalled to discuss the ethical issues raised by terraforming.;    &quot;It'sbasically an issue of preservation,&quot; said Robert Haberle, a research scientistin Ames' Space Science Division. &quot;We're going through a whole bunch ofsoul-searching here on Earth about what we're doing to our planet. I'm notsure we want to do that to another planet that's already perfect and unique inits own right.&quot;;    The terraforming team is quick to acknowledge that theydon't even know if their ideas could work, much less whether any governmentwould want to fund a massive project that wouldn't bear results forgenerations.;    The biggest unanswered questions are whether there is enoughcarbon dioxide and nitrogen trapped in Mars' lifeless rocks to produce aviable atmosphere if temperatures are raised. The team is hoping informationfrom next year's orbiting Mars Observer mission and the Soviet Union's plannedpilotless Mars landing later in the decade will determine whether terraformingis feasible.;    &quot;Obviously it's not a crash program,&quot; Toon said. &quot;But it'ssomething for people to think about.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID BANK, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910808  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  702  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday August 8, 199100221091,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
