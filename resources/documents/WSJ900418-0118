The clashes have occurred mainly in the Georges Bank area,a big fishing ground in the Gulf of Maine.</LP><TEXT>   The proposed agreement would make it illegal under U.S.law for U.S. fishermen to fish in Canadian waters. It alsowould make it illegal under Canadian law for Canadians tofish in U.S. waters.   The poaching problem has become more acute since a 1984World Court boundary ruling gave Canada some rich fishinggrounds in the Georges Bank region that had been traditionalfishing areas for U.S. vessels.   Some U.S. fishermen who have been caught in Canadianwaters have tried to outrun Canadian patrol boats. Theseverest penalty they currently face in the U.S. is a $10,000fine for importing illegal goods, which often is less thanthe proceeds they obtain from the catch. If Canadian patrolboats catch them, they can face fines of up to 750,000Canadian dollars (US$641,700) and a possible jail term.   U.S. fishermen claim Canadian patrol boats have tried tocripple their vessels by fouling their propellers with cablesand by shooting water down their smoke stacks. Canadianpatrol boats also have allegedly rammed some fishing boats.   No one has been seriously injured in a chase yet but theclashes have been a concern particularly since Canadianpatrol boats were fitted with guns three years ago. Canadianshave fired warning shots near fleeing U.S. fishing boatstwice. On another occasion permission to fire was requestedfrom Ottawa but denied.   Last December, a Canadian destroyer fired shots across thebow of a U.S. scallop dragger. The destroyer chased thescalloper for eight hours and collided with it three timesbefore the scalloper managed to escape to a U.S. port.   &quot;There definitely is the potential for catastrophe,&quot; inGeorges Bank said Jeffrey Pike, a spokesman for Rep. GerryStudds, the head of the U.S. House of Representativessubcommittee on fisheries. Mr. Studds believes a reciprocalenforcement of fisheries laws would enable U.S. fishermen to&quot;fish without fear of being shot at or rammed or spied on.&quot;   Under the proposed new agreement, U.S. fishermen wouldface fines of up to $100,000 and could have their fishinglicences revoked.   Some Canadians oppose the proposed agreement. The U.S. &quot;isthe enemy,&quot; said William Rompkey, a Canadian Member ofParliament. It isn't &quot;reasonable&quot; to &quot;depend on them toprosecute their own people,&quot; he said.   Canadian and U.S. officials predict they will reach anenforcement accord by autumn.</TEXT></DOC>
