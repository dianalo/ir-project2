The high court ruled that Georgia must provide retroactiverelief, probably a tax refund, to liquor distillers locatedin other states who paid a discriminatory tax on alcohol thatthey sold in Georgia. The tax favored local distillers.</LP><TEXT>   The decision, which produced five separate opinions and noclear majority opinion, was the latest in a line of complexbut important rulings that involve the issue of how a statemakes amends for an unconstitutional tax. The question onwhich the justices are most deeply divided is under whatcircumstances a state must refund taxes that were paid beforethe tax was ruled unconstitutional.   Yesterday, six justices agreed that once a court orders arefund in a case in which a state tax was invalidated, thestate must also make refunds to all other taxpayers who madesimilar payments before the ruling on that first case inwhich the tax was struck down.   The court's lead opinion, written by Justice David Souter,left open the possibility that states may use less expensiveforms of retroactive relief than refunds.   But refunds are at the heart of a dispute that may beaffected by yesterday's ruling. That issue is whether about15 states must pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxrefunds to former federal workers whose pensions were taxedwhile pensions of state employees weren't.   In 1989, the Supreme Court ruled in a Michigan case thatstates can't favor retired state and local governmentemployees over federal retirees in taxing pension income.   Since then, thousands of federal retirees in more than 20states have filed claims for tax refunds for several yearsbefore 1989. A few states have decided to make full refunds,but most have resisted. In Virginia alone, the state saysrefund claims total $440 million.   Yesterday's decision appears to have opened the door tothese retirees' claims. &quot;The ruling is very much in favor ofthe claims made by the retirees,&quot; said Michael Kator, whorepresents retirees seeking refunds in several states.   The high court may shed more light on these cases nextweek, when it may announce whether it will hear appeals inany of three cases in which Virginia and South Carolinadeclined to order refunds.   The reason yesterday's decision is likely to help theretirees is that the 1989 ruling provided a refund to theMichigan resident who challenged the Michigan tax. Under theprinciple of yesterday's decision, once the first caseprovided retroactive relief, other taxpayers are entitled tothe same relief.   The decision may also have an impact on the nature andvolume of civil constitutional cases in the Supreme Court.Until now, the court has customarily announced aconstitutional rule in one case and then deferred thequestion of its retroactive effect to later cases. Now,according to Mark Evans, a Washington lawyer, &quot;Both concernswill come up at the outset, not later.&quot;   The court, however, remains divided over the broadquestion of how to apply its decisions. Three justices --Antonin Scalia, Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun -- saidall decisions should apply retroactively. Four justices --Sandra O'Connor, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and AnthonyKennedy in a dissenting opinion, and Byron White, agreeingwith the majority -- said that in some cases it isappropriate to apply decisions only prospectively, notretroactively. Justice Souter, joined by Justice JohnStevens, avoided taking a final position on this largerissue.   The ruling yesterday requires Georgia to give retroactiverelief for the tax years 1982, 1983 and 1984 to James B. BeamDistilling Co., a unit of American Brands Inc. The companysued for $2.4 million in refunds, saying it was discriminatedagainst by Georgia's liquor tax. Georgia state courts struckdown the tax but refused to order retroactive relief forBeam.
