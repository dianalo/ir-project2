The album, with music by two dozen Western musicians, wasproduced by Greenpeace, the international environmental group.Millions of dollars from its sales will go toward fightingenvironmental problems in the Soviet Union.   The hoopla was especially great Monday on Moscow's KalininProspekt outside the Melodiya store, where Gabriel and Annie Lennoxof the Eurythmics autographed copies of ``Breakthrough.''   The album also contains music by artists including U2, Sting, theGrateful Dead, Talking Heads, Huey Lewis and the News, Bruce Hornsbyand the Range, Sade, John Cougar Mellencamp and Dire Straits.   At the Kalinin store, a police guard was posted at the door, anda steel barricade was set up on the sidewalk as young Sovietswearing traditional Russian fur hats and Western-style ski capsmassed.   Melodiya, the name of the state's record company as well asrecord stores, is known for small pressings of popular albums,especially rock, and the initial pressing of 500,000 copies of``Breakthrough'' was likely to last just a couple of days _ if nothours. Melodiya plans to release 3 million copies, as well as500,000 cassettes, in this country of 285 million people.   A black market for Western rock recordings thrives in the SovietUnion, and even Melodiya Director Valery Sukharado admitted toreporters, ``I don't know how many (copies) will be released on theblack market.''   The two-record album carries a compilation of songs previouslyissued in the West by the individuals and groups. Internationalrelease is scheduled for April 25.   Sukharado said Melodiya will donate about $16 million from recordsales to a Moscow-based charity that is working with Greenpeace onenvironmental problems in the Soviet Union.   Peter Bahouth, the executive director of the Greenpeace branch inthe United States, said his organization plans to open an office inMoscow.   Some of the rock stars told a news conference here that they weresurprised at how well rock is known in the Soviet Union, where themusic was once condemned as ``decadent'' and kept underground.   Now, the sounds of Dire Straits or Soviet pop stars like BlackCoffee are heard on once-staid official Radio Moscow.   Jerry Harrison, keyboard player for the Talking Heads, said heand several other Western musicians visited a rock music centerSunday night in Gorky Park and saw Soviet musicians who had madetheir own instruments.   ``That shows how much the kids in the Soviet Union want to playrock music and are interested in it,'' Harrison said.   Gabriel said he liked several Soviet rock groups and quipped,``This is the best way to conquer the West.''   He said he learned during his visit that one of his albums hadbeen released in the Soviet Union and ``found the fans here verywarm, friendly and generous.'' Gabriel said he would like to performin the Soviet Union next year if his band is ready.</TEXT></DOC>
