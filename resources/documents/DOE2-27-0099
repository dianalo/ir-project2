Brookhaven'sScanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) is unique in many respects.It is like the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) or the High FluxBeam Reactor (HFBR) at Brookhaven, but on a much smaller scale. The STEMuses electrons that are focussed through the sample, and detected. Itis a scanning microscope because it scans the beam much like a televisionset. This is in contrast to most electron microscopes that are fixedbeam, flood the sample with electrons, and then use a lens after thesample that reimages the material at higher magnification. There aresome advantages to scanning, which will also be described. 19 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
