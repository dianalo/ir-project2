When soundwaves are sufficiently intense, they can create disturbances in the electrondensity at ionospheric heights. In this paper, we consider the propertiesof radio wave scattering off such disturbances created by infrasoundwaves, i.e., we consider Mandel'shtam-Brillouin scattering in the ionosphere.The authors discuss the possibility of a radiophysical enhancement ofthe effect connected with the phenomenon of resonance scattering of theradiowaves off the disturbances created in the medium by the acousticwave.</TEXT></DOC>
