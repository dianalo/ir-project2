The VOA, part of the U.S. Information Agency, broadcasts in 43languages to countries abroad. Its charter forbids it frombroadcasting in the United States.   VOA allows outsiders to review its editorials, take notes onthem and print material from them, but they can't be photocopied.   Michael G. Gartner, the president of NBC News, says VOA'sdecision to grant anyone access to the editorials and to print fromthem stems from a policy change that resulted from a federallawsuit he filed in Des Moines last year. The suit was laterdismissed.   VOA officials contend their policies remain unchanged, but theyacknowledge they've taken step to make sure open procedures arefollowed.   Several recent editorials, which are identified as reflectingthe views of the U.S. government, underscore other statements fromsome U.S. officials that they were taken by surprise by the pace ofthe rapid-fire changes, such as the opening of the Berlin Wall lastweekend.   For instance, on Oct. 28, the VOA said the East Germangovernment had made only ``vague promises'' in response to itscitizens' demands for freedom and democracy.   It praised Hungary's reforms, and added: ``There is a profoundlesson for the East German government in the Hungarian example.''   On Nov. 5, a week before the East Germans opened the 28-year-oldBerlin Wall, a VOA editorial said the East German leadership has``far to go in establishing freedom of travel to all countries as afundamental right protected by law.   ``Many of the recent refugees chose to flee chose to flee theirhomeland because they have no faith in Communist Party leader EgonKrenz' promise to carry out reforms,'' the editorial said.   It continued: ``As one refugee said, `Krenz is making a lot ofpromises, but we do not believe him. We do not see any future andcertainly not for our children.'''   While thousands of East Germans who fled the country primarilythough Czechoslovakia before the dismantling of the Berlin Wallhave remained in the West, millions of East Berliners simplycrossed over the border for a visit before returning home.   The Nov. 14 editorial pushed for further reforms in EastGermany, including free elections, a free press, independent tradeunions, market-oriented changes and parliamentary control of thecountry's security police.   Reports from East Germany on Nov. 15 indicated leaders hadagreed on some reforms like liberal foreign trade rules, moreprivate enterprise, reduced central planning and a greater role forwomen.   Often, the editorials stress the evils of communism.   In discussing the opening of the wall, the VOA said thestructure ``has been a monument to the failure of communism for 28years and last weekend's events are now confirming that failure.''   Another editorial Oct. 7 said: ``October 7 is the 40thanniversary of the establishment of East Germany but for thegovernment of Erich Honecker there is little cause for celebration.   ``Forty years after its creation, communist East Germany hasclearly failed to establish itself as an acceptable alternative todemocratic West Germany.''   Quoting President Bush, the editorial said, ``The United Stateslooks forward to the day that Germans will not have to climbfences, freeze in embassy courtyards or dodge bullets in order toenjoy the fruits of a free society.''</TEXT></DOC>
