They fervently wish their jobs would remain just as they are, forever, but they harbor no illusions about that. Their companies, still shrinking to remain competitive, are losing any similarity to the large, beneficent organizations the managers joined early in their careers.    &quot;The standing joke is that the objective around here is to run the company without any people,&quot; says a quality-control manager for a Chicago chemical company.    The Wall Street Journal asked Creative Research Associations of Chicago to assemble Chicago and St. Louis focus groups of managers at large companies. The managers were asked how corporate restructurings of the past few years had affected their attitudes toward their jobs. The managers agreed to talk freely, provided that their names weren't printed.    Many reveal hurt, anxiety and a sense of betrayal over the wrenching turmoil of the past few years. They still love their big-company jobs and the opportunities their companies offer. They yearn for security and look to their companies to provide it. They are eager to stay loyal. But in light of what has befallen colleagues and friends -- and what may yet happen to them -- many have come to view their employers as the enemy.    &quot;There's a cold war with the people,&quot; says Bill H., a traffic manager for a Chicago consumer-products maker whose departmental staff was cut by 25%. &quot;We've lost some of the personal-type atmosphere.&quot; John, a fleet manager with a major soft-drink company, agrees. &quot;When they start offering packages,&quot; he advises, referring to early-retirement and severance offers, &quot;take them and run. They bayonet the wounded.&quot;    Many of the managers originally went to work for their companies for mundane reasons. &quot;Fringe benefits,&quot; says John, a maintenance manager for a large electric utility. &quot;Security,&quot; says Jim, a quality-control manager for a large chemical company in Chicago. &quot;Profit-sharing,&quot; says Bill H. &quot;After 10 years, you're vested 100%.&quot;    But intangibles counted, too. &quot;I got used to working in a business on a national scale,&quot; says Betty, a sales manager for a railroad, who says her education in business administration prepared her for her work. &quot;I like working on fighter aircraft,&quot; says a program engineer with McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis.    Let others extol the joys of entrepreneurship. These managers want none of its risks. Bill K., a credit manager for a Chicago manufacturing company, watched his parents struggle to eke out a living from the flower shop they owned. &quot;There were times when I was growing up when I wondered if we would eat,&quot; he says.    Many in these Midwestern firms wistfully hark back to the days when companies seemed to take care of their own. A product manager for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. recalls: &quot;If a guy died, they'd give the job to his wife to keep it in the family.&quot;    All agree that those days are gone forever. Bill H., the traffic manager, is trying to reduce staff in his own department. He doesn't like it, but he knows he has to do it. &quot;Systems have replaced people,&quot; he says. &quot;If you aren't in management-information systems and reducing head count, you'd better leave.&quot;    The sense of impending doom has stymied teamwork, they say. &quot;There was a lot more helping out and sharing before,&quot; says Bill K., the credit manager. Today, he says, the attitude is &quot;I've got my job and you've got your job.&quot; Adds Jim, a division manager for a retailer: &quot;It's a dog-eat-dog world.&quot;    Tension is exacerbated by overwork. &quot;We're being asked to do more with fewer people,&quot; says a McDonnell Douglas personnel man. &quot;Our work suffers.&quot; All struggle with feelings of powerlessness, a sense that they have lost a measure of control over their own lives. &quot;There's a very insecure feeling about whether you'll have that job or not,&quot; says the traffic manager. &quot;I see it all around me. People are fired, and it doesn't always reflect their talent or contribution.&quot;    A Monsanto Co. project director says: &quot;We're feeling vibrations from Europe and Japan rippling through our company. Our core business is being managed with fewer people.&quot;    The advice they offer other middle managers: &quot;Get as much education as you can,&quot; says Betty, the sales manager. &quot;No company can take that away from you.&quot; Says John, the fleet manager: &quot;Lock and load and face the front. We're all pawns in someone's game.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
