A letter bearing the names of the three former officials, seeking$100 donations to the ``Dr. James E. Baugh Legal Defense Fund,''says Baugh has ``been victimized by the same machinery that hastargeted other leaders nationwide.''   That is an apparent reference to investigations stemming fromallegations of fraud, mismanagement and influence peddling at HUD.   The three former HUD officials are Maurice Barksdale, LanceWilson and Al Moran.   Baugh, former HUD assistant secretary for public and Indianhousing and urban development, was indicted in May, accused ofsteering a $400,000 HUD contract to a Washington developer, John B.Clyburn. In return, the indictment alleged, Clyburn promised toincrease the salary of Baugh's wife, who worked for a companyClyburn owned. The indictment said Clyburn, who has close ties toWashington Mayor Marion Barry, also helped Baugh's wife obtain a$45,000 city contract.   Baugh and Clyburn pleaded innocent and were released pendingtrial.   Baugh was hired as a housing official by Dade County, Fla.,shortly after he left HUD, and a separate investigation is under wayto determine whether there was any connection between thatappointment and $28 million in HUD contracts Dade County received inthe six preceding months. He was suspended from the Florida jobafter being indicted in Washington.   As for the three men trying to raise money for him:   _Wilson, former top aide to Reagan administration HUD SecretarySamuel Pierce, has been shown to be the owner or developer of sixprojects that received HUD rehabilitation funds after he left theagency.   _Moran, who served as assistant secretary for community planningand development under Pierce, was involved in approval of a NorthCarolina project being pushed by a longtime Pierce friend. Moranleft the government and joined a law firm that was involved in thedevelopment.   _Barksdale now works in housing management for a company based inTexas and, according to HUD officials, is involved in a number ofHUD projects.   Barksdale and Wilson are listed on the letter as two of the fiveco-chairs of the fund; Moran is listed as its treasurer. Donors areasked to send donations to a Chicago bank.   ``We must pay more than lip service to this affront,'' the lettersays in requesting $100 donations, which it says are being solicitedin hopes of raising $100,000. ``One hundred dollars to assist afriend who has stood by us in our time of need is a smallcontribution when compared with the large contribution he had onmaking our programs successful.''   A copy of the letter obtained by The Associated Press was sent toa housing official in California.   Among the subjects of congressional and FBI investigations areallegations of influence peddling at HUD by former agency officialsand prominent Republicans who served as consultants for developersof HUD projects.   The letter said Baugh ``played a catalytic role'' in the successof public housing during his seven years at HUD. It praised him for,among other things, ``returning our calls and responding with quickanswers,'' ``empowering his staff to assist us when help wasneeded,'' and ``testifying on our behalf at congressional committeehearings.''   Attempts to reach Baugh for comment Friday were unsuccessful. Aman answering the telephone at his Reston, Va., home said Baugh wasnot there. His attorney did not immediately return telephonemessages.</TEXT></DOC>
