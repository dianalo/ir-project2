Already hobbled by the Iran-Contra affair at home, the presidentsuffered a string of disappointments as America's major alliesturned a deaf ear to many of his initiatives.   The defeats were particularly galling because Reagan had enjoyeda number of policy successes only the year before at the Tokyosummit, which he labeled the best economic gathering he hadattended.   But in Venice, there were few expectations for major policybreakthroughs as the leaders of the United States, Japan, WestGermany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada gathered in the ornatelibrary of a 17th century monastery for their discussions.   The parley was labeled the ``lame-duck summit'' even before itbegan because so many of the participants were in the final stagesof their administrations.   Prospects are similarly scaled down for Reagan's final economicsummit, June 19-21 in Toronto. Few new policy initiatives areexpected as U.S. allies prefer to wait and deal with Reagan'ssuccessor.   The president went to Venice last year hoping to convinceAmerica's allies to take a hardline stand on guarding the PersianGulf oil lanes.   Instead the seven major industrial democracies issued a lukewarmdeclaration endorsing the principle of freedom of navigation in thePersian Gulf that fell considerably short of the administration'swishes for a stern warning to Iran.   A year later, the U.S. Navy is still in the Persian Gulfproviding escorts for 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers. Recently, theadministration announced it was expanding American protection tocover neutral merchant ships who are attacked and who seek U.S.help from Navy warships.   The Venice summit basically reiterated the call strongcondemnation of state dealings with terrorists that was hammeredout over two days in Tokyo the year before. The partners did add anew sanction, however, banning airline flights to countries thatrefuse to extradite hijackers.   The allies also gave cautious approval to the quickening pace ofU.S.-Soviet arms negotiations, an area where Reagan will be able toreport substantial progress.   During the Moscow summit, Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev exchanged ratification papers for the medium-rangemissile ban treaty although the talks failed to produce anybreakthrough on an accord to reduce long-range nuclear weapons byas much as 50 percent.   On economic issues, the administration claimed significantprogress was made in Venice on international cooperation. Criticswere less kind, however, labeling the final economic communique a``do-little'' document which failed to reassure financial marketsthat two years of sluggish world growth would not worsen into aglobal recession.   When stock markets from New York to Tokyo crashed in October,many economists believed their worst fears were coming true.However, subsequent events have proven the doomsayers wrong. Theseven nations head into the Toronto summit enjoying some of thefastest growth rates in years.   Trade imbalances, long a source of friction, are easing as well.While the United States suffered a record merchandise trade deficitof $170.3 billion last year, the imbalance between U.S. exports andimports has shrunk significantly in the first three months of thisyear as U.S. manufacturers enjoyed record export sales.   The turnaround represents a belated victory for TreasurySecretary James A. Baker, who in September 1985 reversedadministration policy and came out with the Plaza Accord, a jointeffort with the other summit countries to hasten the dollar'sdecline.   Since that time, the dollar has fallen by about 50 percentagainst the currencies of Japan and West Germany, a fact that hascontributed greatly to the increased competitiveness of Americangoods overseas.   Last year, the United States and its allies became worried thatthe dollar had fallen too far and could frighten away the foreigninvestors the United States needs to finance its budget deficits.   While their efforts to brake the greenback's fall were largelyunsuccessful in 1987, they have had far better luck this year,helped out by coordinated waves of intervention, the process bywhich governments enter the market to buy and sell currencies outof their own treasuries.   The United States in Venice won a consensus that the $200billion being spent annually on farm subsidies werecounterproductive, but since that time U.S. negotiators have had nosuccess in getting agreement on just how to go about eliminatingthose subsidies.   Reagan proposed in Venice scrapping all farm subsidies within 10years, but European officials have vigorously resisted this idea.The issue will again be on the table in Toronto but given theintransigence of the positions, little headway is expected.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 12</NOTE></DOC>
