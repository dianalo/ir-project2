At the same time, the group called on the Justice Department todetermine whether Charles H. Keating Jr. and the savings and loanassociation he heads violated federal election laws.   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.,eventually collapsed and was seized by the government in April.Analysts estimate that it could cost taxpayers $2 billion toprotect the institution's depositors.   Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a self-styledcitizen's lobby, called for ethics committee investigations of fivesenators who met with regulators in April 1987 at the request ofKeating, chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent.   The five are Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; John McCain, R-Ariz.; and Donald W.Riegle Jr., D-Mich.   McCain and DeConcini today pledged their full cooperation withany probe. McCain, in letters to the ethics panel and JusticeDepartment, added, ``I am fully confident that I engaged in nounethical conduct.''   Cranston's spokesman, Murray Flander, said the senator met withregulators only to urge them to bring their lengthy examination ofLincoln to a conclusion, not to influence its outcome.   The other senators' offices did not respond immediately torequests for comment.   Common Cause, along with Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., requestedthe ethics investigation last year that eventually led to thedownfall of former House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas.   Wright was also accused of intervening with regulators on behalfof Sandamp;L owners, but Wertheimer said, ``I think we have a differentcase, different circumstances.''   After three years of examinations and audits, regulators seizedLincoln on April 14. Last month, they filed a $1.1 billion civillawsuit charging Keating, his family and associates with fraud andracketeering. Among the allegations are that Keating diverted moneyfrom Lincoln to fund his personal, political and charitableconvictions.   All five senators received campaign contributions from Keating.Riegle, now chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, returned hisa year later and DeConcini last month.   Wertheimer said the Senate Ethics Committee should appoint aspecial counsel to determine whether the intervention violated theCode of Ethics for Government Service that prohibits members ofCongress from accepting ``favors or benefits under circumstanceswhich might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing theperformance of governmental duties.''   In a letter today, he asked Gerald E. McDowell, chief of theJustice Department's public integrity section, to determine whetherKeating's contribution to the senators violated federal electionlaws or other statutes.   Meanwhile, the House Banking Committee, in preparation for fourpublic hearings on the case, voted Thursday to subpoena Keating.   ``We already know that in Lincoln we have on our hands a casethat will cost the savings an loan insurance fund at least $2billion,'' House banking panel chairman Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez saidin a statement. ``This committee ... is required to determine whatwent wrong within the regulatory agencies.''   Also subpoenaed Thursday by the House panel were L. WilliamSeidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.; M. DannyWall, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision; WilliamCrawford, California savings and loan commissioner, and otherofficials.   The hearings are expected to focus on why Wall, as the nation'stop Sandamp;L regulator, delayed action from mid-1987 until April on arecommendation from field examiners that the government takecontrol of Lincoln.   The panel, on a 41-0 vote, approved the subpoenas, legal ordersto appear before the committee or produce documents. Rep. FrankAnnunzio, D-Ill., voted ``present,'' explaining later that hebelieved the committee was unfairly creating the impression thatthose receiving subpoenas are guilty.   The banking committee hearings are scheduled for Tuesday and forOct. 24, Oct. 31 and Nov. 7.   Keating, tentatively scheduled to testify at the last of thehearings, issued a statement through a spokesman in Washingtonsaying he had not decided whether to appear voluntarily.   ``He wants to cooperate with the committee to the maximum extentpossible but in light of the number and complexity of the legalproceedings in which he is involved, he wants to reflect on thisdecision,'' said the spokesman, Leonard Bickwit.   Gonzalez, D-Texas, noted that Seidman requested subpoenas ``sothat the agency's testimony may be complete and the necessarydocuments provided without incurring additional legal risks.''California regulators made a similar request, he said.   Gonzalez said the committee did not intend to ``causeunnecessary problems'' for the lawsuits surrounding Lincoln andAmerican Continental, but said ``there is no question about theparamount rights of the legislative branch in this area.''   Also subpoenaed was Edwin J. Gray, Wall's predecessor, who metin April 1987 with four senators regarding Keating's complaints hewas being unfairly targeted by regulators. Riegle did not meet withGray, but attended a second meeting with officials from theagency's San Francisco office.</TEXT></DOC>
