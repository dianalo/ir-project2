But BTR said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that Chicago-based Stewart-Warner hasn't responded formally to its July 31 bid, which has an indicated value of $197.4 million.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stewart-Warner closed yesterday at $35 a share, down 12.5 cents.    BTR said that it holds a 7.6% stake in the maker of electronic and fabricated metal products and hardware, and that it has agreed to purchase an additional 9.6% stake in Stewart-Warner from Paoli, Pa.-based Ametek Inc. for $33 a share. The Ametek purchase is conditioned on approval of federal antitrust authorities. Ametek is an industrial products maker.    According to the filing, representatives of BTR met with Mr. Archambault last Tuesday to discuss the general terms of the proposal. BTR said it urged him to &quot;carefully consider&quot; BTR's proposal, stressing &quot;the importance of Mr. Archambault's participation in any combined enterprise.&quot;    Mr. Archambault declined to comment yesterday through a spokeswoman. As previously reported, BTR and Mr. Archambault have held talks concerning a possible acquisition since 1981.    According to the filing, Mr. Archambault in 1985 contacted a representative of BTR to determine whether BTR was interested in acquiring Stewart-Warner &quot;in the event a third party sought to acquire control of the company.&quot; BTR indicated it wasn't interested in acquiring Stewart-Warner at that time because of its recent acquisition of Dunlop PLC.    BTR, holding 491,300 Stewart-Warner common shares, said it filed with antitrust regulators last Wednesday to acquire as much as 100% of Stewart-Warner's 6.5 million common shares outstanding, according to the filing. The waiting period is scheduled to expire Sept. 4. </TEXT></DOC>
