The load loss standard,driven by the test voltage through a low-loss high-voltage gas-dielectricreference capacitor, simulates an inductive load which can provide loadcurrents up to 1000 A. It basically provides a known and stable lossor reference power, determined by the test voltage and the loss tangentsetting, to the transformer loss measuring system, such that its accuracycan be characterized over different voltage, current, and power factorranges.</TEXT></DOC>
