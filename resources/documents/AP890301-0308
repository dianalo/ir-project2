A bipartisan group of congressmen plans to introduce legislationThursday that would forbid the government from going to bat for thecigarette industry overseas.   ``The message we are sending is that Asian lungs are moreexpendable than American lungs,'' says Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.   Says Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., ``If we are as sensitive as weare about the health of American consumers, this certainly lookslike an outrageous double standard.''   Levine and Atkins will be joined by Rep. Bob Whittaker, R-Kan.,and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy andCommerce subcommittee on health and the environment, in introducingthe legislation.   Tobacco exports mushroomed during the Reagan administration as aresult of a highly effective campaign against foreign trade barriersby the U.S. special trade representative's office and other agencies.   U.S. tobacco sales to Asia increased by 76 per cent in 1987.Tobacco-related earnings worldwide totaled about $2.5 billion.   Atkins sees th overseas sale of American cigarettes as a healthissue _ ``exporting death,'' he calls it. But his detractors in thetobacco industry and elsewhere regard it as a trade issue that takeson crucial importance because of the country's huge, albeitdeclining, trade deficit. The deficit for 1988 was $137.3 billion.   Under the draft legislation, the president would be preventedfrom seeking the ``removal or reduction by any foreign country ofany restrictions'' on the advertising, manufacture, packaging,importation, sale or distribution of tobacco products.   Gary Miller, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, whichpromotes the industry's interests, says other countries are``perfectly capable of determining and applying rules andregulations regarding tobacco products, and they don't need the U.S.Congress stepping in to provide guidelines on how to handle thatproduct in their own country.''   The legislation also would require all exported tobacco to carryeither a surgeon general's warning about the hazards of smoking or acomparable warning established by the importing country.   Says Mark Eaton, an aide to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a stalwartbacker of the tobacco industry, ``We certainly think that as long astobacco is a legal product we will fight to see that it can takeadvantage of the same agricultural export programs that othercommodities receive.''   The U.S. government apparently operates with two minds about thepropriety of promoting tobacco exports.   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop says, ``I don't think that we ascitizens can continue to tolerate exporting disease, disability anddeath.''   But Peter Allgeier, assistant U.S. trade representative for Asiaand the Pacific, has a different view.   Allgeier did not return a reporter's phone call but was quoted inthe New York Times as saying, ``It's not as though we areintroducing Asia to tobacco. The Chinese manufacture and consume 1.3trillion cigarettes annually.   ``The market in Tiwan and Korea was established long before anytrade negotiations, and they're going to smoke whether the U.S. isexporting cigarettes or not.''   From all appearances, Allgeier has more clout than Koop. Allgeierhas been the point man for the campaign to help tobacco companiesgain access to previously restricted markets in East Asia.   Allgeier's lever was Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974,which gives the government the authority to impose sanctions againstany nation whose trade policies are ``unjustifiable, unreasonable ordiscriminatory.''   Under threat of retaliatory U.S. tariffs, Japan opened its doorsto foreign cigarettes in October 1986. According to World Watchmagazine, U.S. cigarette exports to Japan quadrupled.   Under similar U.S. pressure, South Korea and Taiwan also droppedtheir restrictions on foreign cigarettes.   Miller, the Tobacco Institute spokesman, said overall cigaretteconsumption has been declining in Asia. The World Watch article,written by Lori Heise, says there has been a 5 per cent increase incigarette consumption in Taiwan since the restrictions were dropped.   A U.S. government publication, World Situation and TobaccoReport, says that after advertising for U.S. cigarette commercialsbegan saturating Japanese television, cigarette sales in Japanincreased 2 per cent, reversing a 20-year downward trend.   Gregory Connally, who returned this week from a 10-day trip toAsia on behalf of the American Cancer Society, says the U.S.government should do less for the tobacco industry and more for foodexporters.   ``We're using valuable trading chits for a product that has nonutritional value,'' he says.   While American beef, wheat, rice and citrus products are deniedaccess to many Asian countries, he says, ``Marlboros and Winstonsare going to Taiwan and South Korea.''</TEXT></DOC>
