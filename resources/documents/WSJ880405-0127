The unusual incentive announced yesterday by the U.S. sales arm of Daimler-Benz AG of West Germany could be worth more than $1,900, depending on the cost of flights from the U.S. to Stuttgart on Pan Am or Lufthansa Airlines. Mercedes said it will provide either one round-trip business class ticket or two round-trip economy class tickets.    Taking delivery of a 1988 Mercedes 300 E at the Stuttgart factory could save a U.S. customer almost 11% off the U.S. suggested retail price of $44,400, a Mercedes spokesman said. The price of a model bought at Stuttgart is $39,645, including the cost of shipping the car to the U.S., plus import duty of about $970, the spokesman said.    Mercedes sales in the U.S. were off 17% through February, excluding tourist deliveries. </TEXT></DOC>
