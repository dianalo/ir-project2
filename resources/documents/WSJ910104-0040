Hay, is relinquishing his duties as chiefexecutive, and the company is expected to name David H. Hoag,head of LTV's steel unit, as his successor.   Mr. Hoag, the longtime heir apparent to Mr. Hay, is alsoexpected to be named president of the company. Mr. Hoag, 51years old, will be the first steel-related executive to takethe reins of LTV, which also has interests in defense,aerospace and energy.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Hoag has been chief executive officer and president ofLTV's steel unit since 1985 and has been executive vicepresident of the company since 1986. LTV's board is scheduledto meet at 9 a.m. CDT today to consider his promotion tochief executive. The company declined to comment yesterday onthe meeting.   Mr. Hay, 62, has been the head of LTV for the past eightyears, a period dominated by the company's filing forbankruptcy-court protection from its creditors and therelated dispute over a $2.3 billion shortfall in employeepension funds.   Mr. Hay apparently made his decision to step aside inorder to start the transition to a management team that canlead LTV once it emerges from bankruptcy-court protection. Atthe same time, Mr. Hay has acknowledged that the bankruptcyproceedings are far from complete.   Creditors' attorneys said the change in control isn'texpected to speed or slow the company's emergence frombankruptcy-court protection because of the continuing disputewith the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agencythat insures pension funds. The dispute has kept LTV fromfiling a reorganization plan during the 4 1/2 years it hasbeen under bankruptcy-court protection.   The company yesterday responded to the agency's proposalthat it repay $3.1 billion in pension liabilities, plusinterest, over the next 30 years. The company has said itstill can't afford to fully fund those liabilities and payits other creditors, who have about $4 billion in claimsoutstanding.   While the pension agency and the company attempt tonegotiate a repayment schedule, the clock is running on thecompany's next deadline for submitting a reorganization plan.The deadline is March 6, and the company is scheduled todeliver a status report on Jan. 17 to U.S. Bankruptcy JudgeBurton R. Lifland in New York.   Judge Lifland also will have to approve the change inmanagement at LTV. The company's unsecured creditors wereconsidering the change yesterday and weren't expected tooppose Mr. Hoag as a successor to Mr. Hay.   &quot;Mr. Hoag has proven his reputation as a good solidmanager in the steel operations,&quot; said Wilbur Ross ofRothschild Inc., the unsecured creditors' investment bankingfirm. &quot;We just hope he can carry that kind of managerialskill over to the aerospace operations, which have not beenprofitable for over a year.&quot;   Mr. Hoag's attention to the steel unit's operations alsohas allowed him to distance himself from LTV's drawn-outbankruptcy proceedings, which may be an added attraction fordisgruntled creditors.   &quot;I think Dave Hoag is considered more involved in theoperations and management of the steel division rather thanthe corporate victories and defeats,&quot; said John Tumazos, ananalyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.&quot;He may be the one among senior management least tarnished bythe bankruptcy process.&quot;   Unlike most top steel executives who come from anengineering background, Mr. Hoag came from sales and hasstrong marketing insight. As such, industry analysts say, heis more inclined to focus on relationships with customersthan spending money on new plants. They say he has succeededin making LTV one of the leading suppliers to Japanesetransplants while continuing to maintain the company'sposition as the largest steel supplier to General MotorsCorp.   Still, others say the steel operations haven't fared aswell as they should considering that LTV Steel Co. isn'thampered by interest and pension costs while underbankruptcy-court protection.   Furthermore, most of LTV's plants are relatively modernand the company has limited itself to the more profitableflat-rolled steel product. Yet in the third quarter, LTVSteel had a loss of $7 per ton of steel shipped, while mostof its competitors reported gains, and analysts look foranother loss in the fourth quarter.   LTV Corp. had a net loss of $30.4 million, or 33 cents ashare, for the third quarter. For the same period a yearearlier, the company reported net income of $85.7 million, or68 cents a share.</TEXT></DOC>
