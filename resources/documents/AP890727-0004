The youth congress is based in Dharmsala, an exile colony ofTibetan refugees in the foothills of the Himalayas in northernIndia.   The first of Dharmsala's 7,000 inhabitants fled their homeland,along with their spiritual and temporal leader, the Dalai Lama, toescape the Chinese occupation army in 1959.   ``For 30 years we have been speaking of Chinese atrocities. IfChina is capable of killing their own people, surely they will nothesitate to show any mercy on the Tibetans,'' said Sonam Topgyal ofthe Tibetan Information Office of the government-in-exile inDharmsala.   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of unarmed civilians were killedJune 3-4 when troops used guns and tanks to clear central Beijingof pro-democracy protesters.   ``We lost an opportunity (to win independence),'' said RinzenDolkar, a middle-aged housewife who runs a small cafe, referring tothe crackdown.   In the past, the Chinese military and police have often crushedpro-independence demonstrations in Tibet and exiles say 800 peopledied during the latest Chinese crackdown in the capital of Lhasa onMarch 5.   Chinese authorities put the toll at 16.   The independence movement, however, has been largely peacefulbecause the revered Dalai Lama advocates non-violence andnegotiations to free his homeland, a remote mountainous region onChina's southern border.   The 6 million Tibetans worldwide consider the Dalai Lama to bethe living Buddha, the founder of the religion.   China claims Tibet has been an integral part of Chineseterritory for seven centuries. But Tibetans maintain it was anindependent nation before the communists moved into Tibet in 1950.   ``China will not loosen its grip over Tibet because of itsmilitary importance. Also, China desperately needs land for itsbursting population,'' said Jampa Dharton, the top religiousadviser to the government-in-exile.   China has not responded to the Dalai Lama's long-standing offersthat included his biggest compromise _ allowing China to handleTibet's foreign and defense affairs in return for independence.   But a senior official of the Tibetan government-in-exile,speaking on condition of anonymity, said: ``I have my doubts aboutnon-violent methods with the Chinese.''   Dawa Norbu, an international relations expert at New Delhi'sJawaharlal Nehru University, said the Dalai Lama should now askTibetans in Lhasa to stage more protests so the Chinese will have``no option but to hold talks.''   The most vocal opponent of the Dalai Lama's stand is the TibetanYouth Congress led by the 35-year-old Tsering, a former guerrillawho claims to have 10,000 followers, mostly in India.   Tsering says the Chinese authorities are insincere and cannot betrusted to negotiate for an independence. ``Tibetans must put anend to these misplaced hopes and faith,'' he said in a recentinterview.   ``All my life I have been trying to learn and speak English, butI have been learning the wrong language. There's only one languagethe world understands and listens to and that language is violence.We have to learn to speak that language.''</TEXT></DOC>
