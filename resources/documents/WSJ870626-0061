WPP executives again met yesterday with JWT officials to discuss WPP's $50.50 a share, or $515 million, acquisition proposal, a JWT executive said. JWT had said its directors will review the bid as well as &quot;any improvement&quot; in the offering price that WPP &quot;may communicate to JWT prior to such board meeting.&quot;    Sources close to JWT said WPP, a London-based marketing services concern, had indicated it would be prepared to sweeten its bid. The sources declined further comment.    As previously reported, JWT directors have said they would consider alternatives to WPP's proposal, including taking the company private in a leveraged buyout, repurchasing JWT shares or seeking a friendly merger partner for the concern.    Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. has been considering organizing a JWT leveraged buyout, as reported previously. Sources close to JWT said the company also has met with former executives of Ted Bates Worldwide Inc. about a possible friendly acquisition of JWT. Several Ted Bates officials left the agency last year when it was acquired by Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC of Britain. </TEXT></DOC>
