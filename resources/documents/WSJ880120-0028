It will be the first time that the 78-year-old securities firm has acted as specialist in a security traded on an exchange floor.    Salomon said it will act as sole specialist on a minimum of 200 contracts a night, making markets in options on Japanese yen, Australian dollars and West German marks. The securities firm also is considering trading in British sterling and Swiss franc options, said Bruce Brittain, foreign currency product manager.    &quot;Salomon Brothers has the capability to add an unprecedented level of liquidity of the market,&quot; said Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia exchange. Its involvement &quot;will be an invaluable asset to overseas traders.&quot;    Salomon replaces Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Cooper, Neff andamp; Associates, which had been acting as specialists in foreign currency options on the exchange since night trading began Sept. 16. Those firms had been granted specialist privileges on a temporary basis, an exchange official said. Night trading on the Philadelphia exchange operates from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. EST, Sunday through Thursday. Trading volume, according to the exchange, averages 2,500 contracts nightly, with a record of 28,647 reached Jan. 5. </TEXT></DOC>
