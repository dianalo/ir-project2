Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian strongmanwho has been accused of illicit activities and indicted in theUnited States on drug trafficking charges.   In a nationally broadcast message, Delvalle said he had askedNoriega several days ago to step down voluntarily so that aninvestigation of charges of illicit activities could be launched.He said the general declined.   ``There is no other alternative but the use of the powers thatthe constitution gives me, to separate General Noriega from hishigh command and to encharge the leadership of the institution tothe current chief of staff, Col. Marcos Justine,'' Delvalle said.   There was no immediate indication of whether Noriega wouldcomply with the order or if it would be carried out by his officers.   The military has long been regarded as the real power in Panama,with its chief considered the de facto ruler of the country.   The Reagan administration has been calling on Noriega to stepdown since his indictment by a federal grand jury in Miami on drugtrafficking charges on Feb. 5. The two indictments portrayedNoriega as a key member of an international drug traffickingconspiracy.   Demonstrations against Noriega broke out in Panama last Juneafter the military chief's recently retired second in commandpublicly charged the general with illicit activities ranging fromdrug trafficking to electoral fraud and the assassination of apolitical opponent. The military chief said he was innocent.   Delvalle talked to U.S. authorities last Wednesday at anunannounced meeting in Miami.   Reagan administration officials said they received discreetinquiries about U.S. willingness to drop federal drug chargesagainst Noriega.   In his speech Thursday, Delvalle said: ``Panama currently isexperiencing one of the most difficult and dangerous moments of itshistory.''   He added that he reached his decision because of the ``immenseseriousness'' of the situation and ``the fruitlessness of myefforts.''   Delvalle said he ordered Noriega out as chief of the DefenseForces of Panama ``to allow justice to continue an impartial coursewithout pressures of any kind.''   Delvalle was inaugurated in September 1985 after electedPresident Nicolas Ardito Barletta resigned in a dispute withNoriega. Delvalle previously was a little known civilian who hadrun for first vice president on the official party ticket.   Ardito Barletta had been the first elected civilian president totake office in Panama in 16 years, although the 1984 vote wasmarred by charges of vote fraud engineered by the military.   Noriega and his supporters have said those criticizing themilitary leader are trying to break the Panama Canal treaty, underwhich the United States agreed to cede control of the canal on Dec.31, 1999.   Noriega has recently criticized the U.S. Southern Command,headquarters for all U.S. military activities in Latin America.   The Pentagon and the White House interpreted his remarks as acall for the transfer of the 10,000 servicemen and their 20,000dependents from Panamanian soil.   Washington rejected such a move, saying the American troops werelegally in the country and would remain in Panama to protect thecanal until it is handed over to Panama.   In Washington, a Pentagon spokeswoman said Thursday that theU.S. Southern Command had not been put on any type of alert as aresult of Delvalle's action.   ``Everything is normal,'' said Capt. Nancy LaLuntas, thespokeswoman. ``They might be advising (personnel) to avoiddemonstrations, but the command is on normal status at the moment.''   Noriega attended a military college in Peru on a scholarship,then entered the Panamanian National Guard in 1962 as a lieutenant.He quickly became acquainted with a rising young officer named OmarTorrijos.   Torrijos took power in Panama in a 1968 coup and less than ayear later named Noriega, then an obscure major in charge of thecountry's northernmost province, as his chief of intelligence withthe rank of lieutenant colonel.   The job put Noriega in touch with U.S. intelligence agenciesinterested in any potential threats to the security of the PanamaCanal, a vital shipping link between the Atlantic and Pacificoceans.   When Torrijos died in an unexplained airplane crash in 1981,Noriega was well placed to shoulder his way to the top commandahead of several more senior officers. He took power in 1983.   During his birthday speech earlier this month, Noriega declared:``If they want me out, they'll have to kill me.''</TEXT></DOC>
