Taipei refuses to lift a ban on imports of the poultry innards because it doesn't believe doing so will have much effect on its $15.8 billion trade surplus with the U.S. &quot;U.S. chicken traders are trying to sell to us what their domestic market discards,&quot; says Wang Chienshien, a vice minister of economic affairs. Letting in such produce will be read by the Taiwan public as letting the Americans &quot;treat us as inferior people,&quot; he says.    Chicken livers and intestines alone won't do much to help ease the trade gap. But Americans view Taiwan's reluctance to open its market to those goods as part of a wider obstructionism.    Their biggest complaint is that the government has failed to produce a timetable for promised market-opening measures. And while national pride may play a role in Taiwan's attitude, critics say its main purpose in stalling is to protect domestic industries from outside competition.    Wang Chao-ming, an official of the government's Ad Hoc Committee for Sino-American Trade, concedes that Taipei bungled trade matters last year. &quot;Our negotiation tactics and attitudes (toward market opening) are poor,&quot; he says. &quot;Our image in the U.S. is disastrous.&quot;    Taiwan runs the world's third-largest trade surplus with the U.S., after Japan and Canada. An export-driven country with high tariffs and mounting foreign-exchange reserves, it's an easy target for U.S. protectionists. Its perceived stubbornness only makes matters worse, Americans say.    The first round of this year's trade talks began last month, but few people on either side expected significant improvement in the trade imbalance. An official with the Commerce Department in Washington, noting that the gap has grown by about $3 billion in each of the past two years, says the U.S. &quot;doesn't see any reversal in the trend, in the short term at least.&quot;    But business executives say if Taipei plays the negotiations right, it may build a buffer against the many U.S. protectionist bills being drafted and reduce some of Washington's pressure on Taipei to strengthen its currency.    One of the toughest issues to resolve will be the U.S. demand for easier access to Taiwan's insurance market. Already, Taipei opened the door a bit wider in January by allowing American firms greater leeway in soliciting business.    But Washington wants the government to let more U.S. insurance companies into the country -- a demand being resisted by Taiwan's insurance industry.    Equally tough will be U.S. negotiations with the Ministry of Communications, which administers container ports. U.S. shipping companies want to operate their own container terminals in Taiwan and use their own loading equipment, government trade officials say. At present, all shipping companies must rent such equipment from the government.    What irks Washington officials most is Taiwan's failure to keep its promises. In October 1985, for example, Taiwan said it would allow imports of cigarettes and beer within a year. Then negotiations stumbled over a so-called monopoly tax on cigarette imports and Taiwan missed the deadline. Washington accused Taipei of stalling and suspected it might renege. The issue was only resolved last December.    The Taiwanese also procrastinated in implementing a new method for evaluating imports, based on actual prices paid for them rather than government estimates of what they should cost. They agreed to the change back in 1978, and though no deadline was set, the U.S. expected Taiwan to make the switch by January 1986, as other developing countries did.    But when the time came, Taipei told the Americans it wasn't ready. (The new system wasn't adopted until July.)    Robert Parker, a lawyer and chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce's Trade and Economic Affairs Committee in Taipei, describes the hostility in Washington. &quot;Some trade officials there couldn't talk to you about Taiwan without getting angrier and angrier. It will be a miracle if we can avoid a trade war.&quot;    Taiwan is equally bitter over the incident. &quot;When it comes to deciding whose interpretation of the agreement is right, it is always the stronger country's interpretation that counts,&quot; says Mr. Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.    Like it or not, though, the U.S. perceives Taiwan as dragging its feet on most trade-liberalization proposals. Peter Alliger, an assistant U.S. trade representative, complained in New York recently that the U.S. has to exert strong pressure &quot;to obtain even very modest improvements in access&quot; from Taiwan.    To some extent, Taiwan officials may have been misled by the failure of Washington to carry out previous threats of retaliation. Thinking the U.S. was bluffing, they were caught off guard by the escalation of the pressure last year.    They also have been hobbled by inefficient decision-making and poor communications. Vincent Siew, the country's chief trade negotiator, got only cursory instructions from the Ministry of Finance when he took over the cigarette talks in mid-1986, says a Taiwan trade official.    &quot;There wasn't much preparation to speak of, nor was there a comprehensive appraisal of our bottom line,&quot; the official says.    Not only that, the lines of authority within the government are sometimes blurred. A spokesman at the Ministry of Finance asserts that the Economics Ministry represents the country in all trade talks. But the Economics Ministry says it isn't responsible for cigarettes or beer. Such buck-passing increases in the face of a crisis.    Taipei officials say they are addressing these problems. Last month the cabinet expanded the membership of the Ad Hoc Committee on Sino-American Trade to include the central bank governor and the cabinet's own secretary general, and strengthened its policy-making role.    Already, the panel has asked government ministries to submit details of planned liberalization measures. Says the committee's Mr. Wang, &quot;We are aiming to seize market-opening initiatives this year.&quot;    ---              U.S.-Taiwan Trade: The Growing Gap                   (In billions of dollars)                                1984      1985      1986    U.S. imports               $16.1     $17.8     $21.3    U.S. exports                 5.0       4.7       5.5    Deficit                   $(11.1)   $(13.1)   $(15.8)   Source: U.S. Commerce Department</TEXT></DOC>
