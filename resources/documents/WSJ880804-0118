That's the contention of some sellers and financial advisers, who say investors in public partnerships have gone overboard in shunning leveraged programs, which buy property using borrowed funds, in favor of unleveraged programs.    The economic outlook creates &quot;almost an ideal opportunity to use leverage,&quot; says Paul J. Proscia, a managing director for direct investments at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Mortgage rates are reasonable, he says, and if inflation picks up and the real-estate market recovers, boosting prices, then leveraged programs will magnify profits for investors.    Nevertheless, Prudential-Bache isn't making a big push for its brokers to sell leveraged real estate. Such programs, while offering the potential for greater profits, are riskier because of the threat of foreclosure. Trying to sell them would be &quot;fighting the market psychology,&quot; which is geared to maximum safety and current income, Mr. Proscia explains.    Sales of public partnerships that buy unleveraged real estate totaled $1.18 billion in the first half, triple the $386.8 million in sales of programs with leverage of 50% or more. And although sales of leveraged programs rose 68% from a year earlier, they were still far below levels of a few years ago, according to Robert A. Stanger andamp; Co. of Shrewsbury, N.J.    The added risk with leveraged programs was underscored in the poor performance of some partnerships marketed in the early 1980s principally as tax shelters. Investors did get sizable write-offs before the 1986 tax act largely eliminated shelters. But overbuilding and economic problems in Texas and other areas led mortgage lenders to foreclose on numerous properties. Some partnerships folded without ever making a cash distribution.    Still, many market participants say buying unleveraged real estate isn't necessarily a better strategy, primarily because the returns aren't as high in a good market. Indeed, Luke McCarthy, president of syndicator August Financial Corp. in Long Beach, Calif., says syndicators are &quot;a little bit concerned&quot; that five years from now holders of today's all-cash partnerships &quot;will say this is an anemic investment -- and that it will probably be true.&quot;    Mr. McCarthy explains that people who buy all-cash programs are missing the biggest benefit of real estate -- profits from price appreciation that are magnified when the property is purchased with borrowed funds. All-cash partnerships pay higher distributions than leveraged programs initially, because none of the rental income goes to pay mortgage interest, but they pay less when properties are sold.    Paul T. Green, who analyzes real-estate partnerships for securities firms and investors, believes the returns on most all-cash partnerships aren't high enough to compensate for the difficulty of reselling an interest in an ongoing program.    As shown in the accompanying table, Mr. Green, president of Southport Advisors Inc., Southport, Conn., figures a typical all-cash deal with an eight-year life will yield an average of only 6.9% a year after tax if property income and values rise a moderate 5% annually. Mr. Green says, however, that &quot;by taking on leverage of 40% or better, you greatly improve your potential in the moderate-growth case, and you don't give up that much in the bad case.&quot;    Despite the possibility of higher returns with leveraged programs, some financial advisers say the risk is too great. Henry I. Montgomery, a financial planner and president of Planners Financial Services Inc., Minneapolis, agrees that &quot;all-cash real estate isn't all that exciting.&quot; But he says he &quot;just can't see assuming that much risk&quot; by buying a leveraged program, given his view that the real-estate market hasn't bottomed yet.    Even some advisers who like leveraged real estate say all-cash programs have their place. San Francisco financial planner Malcolm H. Gissen recommends all-cash partnerships &quot;for older, more conservative investors, for pension plans and for first-time investors who want to minimize the risk.&quot; Arnold G. Rudoff, a San Francisco consultant who analyzes partnerships for buyers and sellers, recommends investors put at least half of their real-estate dollars into programs that are unleveraged or less than 50% leveraged.    Advisers also say some partnerships are too leveraged. Some public programs borrow as much as 75% of the money they invest, which is down from the 80% level often seen a few years ago. But Mr. Gissen, for example, says he isn't comfortable with leverage above 50% or 60% because of the higher risk of foreclosure.    Peter Heerwagen, chief investment officer for the Ayco Corp, an American Express Co. financial-planning unit, looks for programs in which the expected net operating income from the properties -- using realistic assumptions -- is at least 120% of debt service. He says programs with leverage over 70% rarely pass that test.    ---          What a Difference Leverage Can Make   Annual internal rate of return, after tax, for investor in 28% bracket from a typical eight-year partnership.
