Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary general of the opposition socialists,demanded that Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's government summonNakasone for questioning by a parliamentary committee.   He alleged Nakasone provided Recruit Co., at the center of thescandal, with special favors by ordering Nippon Telegraph andTelephone Co. and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications tobuy supercomputers from the United States for use by Recruit.   In reply to Yamaguchi's questions in Parliament, Minoru Shioya, atelecommunications ministry official, said Nakasone asked theministry to help solve trade frictions with the United States butgave no specific orders. The United States has pressed Japan to buymore American supercomputers.   Takeshita said a separate committee would decide whether tosummon Nakasone, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1987.   Two of Nakasone's secretaries were among 150 influentialpoliticians and businessmen offered bargain stock in a Recruitsubsidiary, Recruit-Cosmos, before public trading of company sharesbegan. The stock price later soared.   In arresting two Recruit officials and two Nippon Telegraphofficials on Monday, prosecutors noted a Supreme Court ruling thatnon-public offers of stock expected to rise in price amounted tobribery.   Two other Recruit officials were arrested Wednesday for allegedlyviolating securities laws. Another was arrested last year forallegedly trying to bribe an opposition member of Parliament todefuse an investigation of Recruit, an information servicesconglomerate.   Two U.S.-made supercomputers bought by Nippon Telegraph wereresold to Recruit but kept on NTT premises and maintained by NTTthough operated by Recruit. Opposition lawmakers are questioning theterms of the arrangement.   Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi charged that sale ofRecruit-Cosmos shares was ``centered around key figures in theNakasone administration'' and that Nakasone was involved in asupercomputer deal between Cray Research Inc. of the United Statesand the Japansese firms.   She also said Nakasone personally recommended Recruit founder andformer chairman Hiromasa Ezoe, who was among those arrested Monday,for a spot on government committees during.   Another opposition lawmaker, Yanosuke Narazaki of the UnitedSocial Democratic Party, said Nakasone's role is essential inunraveling the scandal.   ``It is so clear that the scandal was centered around Mr.Nakasone and key members in his administration,'' Narazaki said.   Ten politicians who served in Nakasone's cabinet are among thoselinked to bargain Recruit share purchases, including Takeshita.   Narazaki said his party and the Democratic Socialist Party willjoin the Socialists, the main opposition, in demanding that Nakasonebe summoned for questioning.</TEXT></DOC>
