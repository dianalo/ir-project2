Their rivalry is ancient. It extends back almost to the turn of the century, when Marcus Samuel, a British kerosene trader, began buying in the newly discovered Texas oil fields. Rankled by the upstart, John D. Rockefeller, whose Standard Oil (Exxon's forebear) dominated the market, tried to take over Mr. Samuel's company. Instead, Mr. Samuel merged his Shell Transport andamp; Trading with Royal Dutch Petroleum, which was already weakening Standard's grip in the Far East.    Today, the rivalry between Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell is heating up. By most measures, Shell is winning. Last year, its $81.4 billion of revenue topped the $76.6 billion of Exxon, which had reigned for decades as the world's undisputed leader in corporate size. Exxon also fell behind in oil production, refining and sales. And although Exxon remains No. 1 in profits, many expect Shell to seize that laurel, too, this year or next.    Much prestige rides, of course, on being the world's biggest anything. Beyond bragging rights, the biggest oil company enjoys some political and pricing advantages. And for a U.S. corporation to relinquish -- for the first time in this century -- the pinnacle of private enterprise is a nagging reminder of the nation's slippage in world trade and in the oil business.    The Shell-Exxon rivalry also shows how the U.S. investment community has burdened American companies with short-term performance pressures that foreign rivals can ignore; how even the biggest companies acquire distinct personalities that influence their growth; and how multinational competitors can choose radically different but still-successful strategies.    Both companies disparage talk of a race for rank. &quot;I don't care,&quot; says Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon's chairman in New York. &quot;Revenues don't count with me. What counts is net income after taxes.&quot;    In London, Peter F. Holmes, who heads Shell Transport, the British side of Royal Dutch/Shell, admits to caring only a little. &quot;It would be very nice to be No. 1&quot; in profitability, he concedes, adding, &quot;That isn't our prime objective.&quot;    Nevertheless, Exxon and Royal Dutch/Shell are &quot;quietly and discreetly&quot; engaged in nothing short of &quot;the battle of the giants,&quot; contends John Toalster, an oil analyst who tracks the contest at London stockbrokers Hoare Govett. Although Mr. Toalster expects Shell to overtake Exxon on all fronts by the late 1980s, he is no fan of Shell. He thinks that Exxon does more for stockholders, and he calls Mr. Holmes's nonchalance toward its bigger profits a smokescreen.    &quot;The only corporate strategy Shell has got is to exceed Exxon on earnings and be the largest oil company in all respects,&quot; Mr. Toalster says.    The assumptions underlying both companies' strategies are similar. Both are betting on an eventual resurgence in the oil business. And both have cut employment, refining capacity and capital spending since oil prices began sliding a few years ago. But Shell is pushing for market share while Exxon has pulled back.    Exxon slashed employment far more sharply -- by 44% to 102,000 by the beginning of this year from 182,000 at the 1982 peak. Meanwhile, Shell's employment declined 16% to 138,000 from 165,000. If the companies stick to this year's capital and exploration budgets, Exxon's outlays, usually the industry's biggest, will fall to $6.5 billion, below Shell's $7.2 billion.    While Exxon cuts oil exploration, chiefly in the U.S., Royal Dutch/Shell presses its search for new fields, Mr. Holmes says. As one result, Shell Oil Co., its group's U.S. unit, passed Exxon last year as the nation's leading oil-well driller.    Royal Dutch/Shell also has moved to fill the void left by Exxon's pullback from some markets. Exxon's world-wide petroleum sales average four million barrels a day, down from its peak of six million barrels a day. &quot;We could sell six million . . . now, but we wouldn't make nearly as much money,&quot; Mr. Rawl explains.    Royal Dutch/Shell, by contrast, is happy to sell six million barrels a day. &quot;We gained market share last year,&quot; Mr. Holmes says. In the U.S., Shell vaulted over Chevron, Texaco and Exxon to become the nation's leading gasoline marketer in 1986. &quot;We don't believe it's the right time to slow down,&quot; says James Grapsi, the general manager of investor relations for Royal Dutch/Shell. &quot;Exxon,&quot; he adds, &quot;is walking to a different beat.&quot;    All this suggests to Paul Mlotok, international-oil analyst at Salomon Brothers, that this year Shell's earnings will rise from the $3.71 billion of 1986 while Exxon's will decline from $5.36 billion last year. In the 1987 first quarter, the companies were neck and neck with relatively lackluster profits of about $1 billion each.    Whether Shell is doing better than Exxon is the wrong question, some observers comment. Charles T. Maxwell, senior energy strategist at Cyrus J. Lawrence, says each company's history, culture, shareholder expectations and regulatory environment push it in different directions.    Exxon began as Standard Oil of New Jersey (its name was changed in 1972). A petroleum refiner and the operating arm of Rockefeller's empire, it had established global beachheads -- in Britain, for example -- before a 1911 court-ordered breakup of the Standard Oil interests left it with little petroleum production and forever under the shadow of U.S. antitrust laws. But it acquired Humble Oil of Texas, later a co-discoverer of Alaska's giant Prudhoe Bay field, and became -- and still is -- the leading U.S. petroleum producer.    An aggressive search for oil elsewhere -- in the Western Hemisphere, Europe and the Mideast -- made Exxon a world leader, even though many of its foreign fields have been nationalized. When oil prices rose in the 1970s, Exxon vaulted to the top of the world's industrial corporations with its huge supplies of U.S. and relatively cheap Saudi Arabian petroleum.    The Royal Dutch/Shell Group -- owned 60% by Royal Dutch Petroleum, based in The Hague, and 40% by Shell Transport of London -- has long been called the &quot;oil company which should not work.&quot; Lacking the big Mideast reserves that bolstered Exxon, it was the weakest of the Seven Sisters -- the international petroleum giants -- but it became a nimble oil trader. What really set it apart, however, was its parentage, described by London's Financial Times as &quot;a hybrid of Dutch dourness and English class consciousness,&quot; and its dual headquarters.    Unlike Exxon, moreover, Shell bases its operating philosophy on decentralization. After Venezuela nationalized its oil industry in the 1970s, the former Shell unit there, Venezuelan oil officials say, adjusted much more easily to separation from its parent because it already had been functioning as a self-contained, self-directed unit with its own production, refineries, markets and staffs.    A current example is U.S. Shell, based in Houston not far from Exxon's chief domestic subsidiary. Wholly owned by the group since 1985, U.S. Shell nevertheless still reports earnings separately. Group executives say that is largely due to its strong-willed American president, John F. Bookout, and to Royal Dutch/Shell's promises in the $5.5 billion acquisition of the remaining 30% of U.S. Shell shares.    Shell units have also displayed a knack for remaining in some countries even after other foreign oil companies are gone. When the Nigerian government, in a backlash against Britain, nationalized the British Petroleum partnership in the Shell-BP Petroleum Development Co. of Nigeria, it left the Shell group's share untouched. Mr. Holmes was then Shell's chief in Nigeria. &quot;When the British become persona non grata, I'm half American, born in Greece and working for a Dutch company,&quot; he explains. Although his father was British, his mother was a U.S. citizen, and he was, indeed, born in Greece.    &quot;With two head offices,&quot; a former Shell official says, &quot;you have to take two points of view. But the curious difference in Shell is that you have a third point of view -- that of the country you are in.&quot; Transferred to New York a few years ago, the man recalls that &quot;in a group, I would almost invariably recognize the Exxon people -- a kind of mixture of caution and diplomacy and being totally certain of themselves. Shell people weren't certain about anything.&quot;    Although both companies' geologists, engineers and researchers are deemed among the best in the industry, Exxon and Shell attract different types of people. &quot;It's the Texas wildcatter vs. the queen of England,&quot; says a Houston oil man whose father was formerly an Exxon executive. A London banker says Shell draws &quot;Oxford types who consider it the next best thing to going into the foreign office.&quot;    Born in New Jersey, Exxon's Mr. Rawl could be taken for a Texas wildcatter. A former Marine and University of Oklahoma petroleum engineer, he acquired a drawl in Southwestern oil fields. He also brought a salty air of informality to Exxon's headquarters. Although he got rid of his spittoon, he still chews cigars and is apt to greet a visitor with his feet on his desk. As the chief executive since Jan. 1, he has built a reputation as a waste-cutter.    Mr. Holmes, a former British soldier and a history graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge, has been the chairman of Shell Transport since July 1985. His style is formal until talk turns to his hobbies. He delights in autographing copies of his book of photographs of Nigeria. Skilled at mountain climbing, skiing and scuba diving, he describes the oil business as &quot;a never-ending cross-country race&quot; in which the fittest -- Shell, for example -- will prosper.    Although many of their debt-laden competitors are hard-pressed to pay bills, Exxon and Shell share the &quot;problem&quot; of investing enormous cash flows. Mr. Mlotok of Salomon Brothers estimates that Exxon's &quot;free cash&quot; -- total cash received less dividend payouts and capital expenses -- will average $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion a year for the next few years. Shell, he forecasts, will accumulate &quot;free cash&quot; totaling $4.7 billion in the 1987-1990 period.    Critics say Exxon is missing a chance to invest more of that cash in the long-term future of the oil business. &quot;Exxon is in a position to take advantage of other oil companies' mistakes,&quot; says William Randol, a First Boston analyst and former Exxon executive. &quot;But oil prices bottomed last summer, and one could argue that Exxon has already missed its buying opportunity.&quot; Adds George Friesen, a Dean Witter analyst and another Exxon alumnus, &quot;Exxon is losing ground to Royal Dutch/Shell.&quot;    Since the oil-price collapse, Exxon has shucked marginal assets and moved out of geographic areas where its position is weak. It seeks instead higher profitability from remaining operations and maximum return on investments, its officials say.    But, like other American corporations, Exxon, which is based in New York, is under pressure from stockholders and Wall Street for quarterly earnings performance, even as it plans for 20 years out. &quot;Of course, {Shell} is headquartered in a different part of the world and has a different philosophy about business,&quot; Mr. Rawl says. Mr. Holmes agrees, commenting, &quot;I don't lose any sleep over one quarter.&quot;    Since 1983, Exxon has spent more than $7 billion buying back its own shares. Exxon officials say this helps raise per-share earnings and the price of the stock, which closed yesterday at $94.875 a share, up from $55 at the beginning of 1986. Stock buybacks, they add, also enable the company to acquire oil reserves -- its own -- at a bargain price of $2.50 to $3 a barrel. &quot;We are competing for the investors' dollars, not necessarily to be the world's largest and least profitable oil company,&quot; Mr. Rawl says.    Over the past three years, Exxon also has acquired $1.4 billion of oil properties, not including a $690 million commitment this year for Australian petroleum interests. But since 1983, Royal Dutch/Shell has spent far more -- $11 billion to $12 billion -- on acquisitions, including the remaining interest in U.S. Shell.    Even when the two companies are partners, they tend to take contrary approaches. According to one Shell official, the group was disappointed when Exxon urged scaling back their joint venture in the Kittiwake North Sea oil field after oil prices plunged last year. The companies had been committed to spending $1.5 billion each, but at Exxon's urging, the official says, development spending was reduced to between $350 million and $400 million each.    &quot;We thought it was a project that should have gone ahead,&quot; he says. &quot;We were surprised at Exxon. We didn't think it was one of the companies that had to worry.&quot; But Mr. Rawl calls the Kittiwake a &quot;modest&quot; field and says Exxon has had bigger differences with its partners over more significant projects.    Shell has its critics, too, particularly in London. Some oil analysts there question whether it shouldn't pay out a larger percentage of its earnings in dividends or buy back some of its shares. Mr. Holmes replies that the dividend gap with Exxon is narrowing and that tax considerations prevent Shell from repurchasing shares.    That doesn't satisfy Shell's champion critic, Mr. Toalster of Hoare Govett. &quot;Although it is incredibly successful,&quot; he says, &quot;Shell is a very aloof, self-confident organization with a long-time drive or need to dominate, and it has decided to go for volume and size.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
