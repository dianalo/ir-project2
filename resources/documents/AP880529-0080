Or is it Bosendorfer?   A rocket scientist and a robotics expert using a 9-foot pianohave teamed up to create an instrument that can record everyflicker of a virtuoso's finger _ and then improve on it.   The Bosendorfer 290 SE Imperial Grand looks like a piano next toa computer. But behind the keyboard, optical sensors, tiny electricmotors and three linked computers form the guts of a frighteninglyaccurate musical instrument.   Invented by a Wayne Stahnke, a scientist from the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasadena, Calif., the Bosendorfer is played like any piano. Inside,the instruments are recording even microscopic motions.</TEXT></DOC>
