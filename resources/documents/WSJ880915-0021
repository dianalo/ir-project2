The action follows Farmers' decision last week to give up an eight-month struggle to remain independent and accept a sweetened offer of $75 a share, or $5.2 billion, from the tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services giant.    B.A.T's acquisition requires the approval of insurance regulators in nine states, and much of Farmers' takeover defense was tied to thwarting efforts to win that approval. Now Farmers, based in Los Angeles, is helping B.A.T. Last month, Washington state's insurance commissioner reversed positions.    The acquisition proposal was also turned down by Oregon earlier this summer. A rejection by the California insurance commissioner was overturned by a state court. Arizona, Illinois and Ohio approved the transaction. Kansas and Texas haven't ruled. </TEXT></DOC>
