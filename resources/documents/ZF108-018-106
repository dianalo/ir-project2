 Seven years ago, only three or four companies regularlyattended the ANSI Standards Committee meetings for FDDI; now nearly everymajor computer vendor goes.andM;FDDI is not purely an American phenomenon.andP;  Signs indicate that the standardis winning acceptance of the international community as well.andP;  Fibronics'products are installed on the Italian superhighway and at Britishuniversities.andP;  Fibronics recently inked an agreement with ASCII to providethe Japanese company with 20 Ethernet-to-FDDI bridges as well as its FDDInetwork management software.andP;  Not all technology is coming from the U.S.andP;  TheFX5500 Series of FDDI products from Fibermux is based on technology fromSumitomo, also in Japan.andM;FDDI's superior network management capabilities and its speed and bandwidthmake it a solution meeting a variety of business networking needs.andP;  It wasdesigned initially as a direct connect medium for workstations runningprimarily graphics-intensive applications that need fiber's high speed.andO;FDDI's capacity to act as a backbone for slower networks also lends itself toMetropolitan Area Networks (MANs) as well as campus-wide andinterdepartmental networks.andP;  FDDI's bandwidth makes it ideal for connectingmainframes.andM;With FDDI, a business can retain the investment in its original equipment andstill take advantage of the security of standardized technology.andP;  FDDI willbe the first international standard for an ultra high-speed network.andP;  Allother high-capacity networks are proprietary.andP;  FDDI is not the final step inthe evolution of networks, of course; one day 100M-bits-per-second will betoo slow.andP;  $TLet's take a look at some products.andP;  Many of which connectEthernet and Token Ring networks to an FDDI backbone or attach mainframes toFDDI or their peripherals.andP;  Also, since the Station Management (SMT) portionof the standard has not been finalized, vendors offering it do so in firmwareto facilitate upgrades.andM;Most of the products discussed here are scheduled for arrival next year, andpricing and shipping dates are tenuous at best.andP;  For more information on thespecifications of FDDI, see &quot;FDDI&quot; and &quot;FDDI Applied&quot; in the August issue ofLAN Magazine.andM;On the DesktopandM;Most PC and Macintosh users can't generate enough traffic to warrant runningfiber to the desktop.andP;  For them, the added expense of fiber to the desktop isnot worth the extra bandwidth.andP;  But for users of high-performanceworkstations, such as those by Sun and Apollo, running fiber to the desktopmakes sense.andP;  Just one of the powerful workstations can churn out enough datato fill Ethernet's bandwidth.andM;Sun Microsystems (Mountain View, Calif.) and the Apollo Systems Division ofHewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, Calif.) announced FDDI interface cards to permita workstations to be connected directly to FDDI.andP;  Apollo plans an FDDIinterface card for its Apollo Series 10000, a 100 MIPS personalsupercomputer.andP;  Sun announced FDDI/Dual Attach Controller, which is a VMEbusboard that plugs into a Sun workstation.andP;  Both cards will support SMT infirmware until the standard settles down.andM;High performance doesn't come cheap.andP;  Sun's controller card costs $12,500.andO;Apollo has not yet set the pricing on its board which begins shipping inApril 1990.andM;Another company has a VMEbus network interface card for FDDI; CMC of SantaBarbara, Calif.andP;  The VMEbus FDDI processor implements CMC's FXP architecture,using an AMD 29000 RISC microprocessor.andP;  Like the Sun and Apollo cards, theCMC card takes up one slot in the VMEbus machine and permits connection toboth rings of the FDDI network.andM;The CMC-1056 is offered in two versions of the development kits.andP;  The firstis aimed at those who want to develop device drivers using the CMC-135Ethernet adapters today and use the same drivers for FDDI in the future.andP;  Forthose interested solely in FDDI, a second kit provides two FDDI cards.andM;CMC's FDDI Developer's kit with FDDI and Ethernet interfaces is priced at$29,995.andP;  The FDDI-only version is priced at $24,995.andM;Interphase (Dallas, Tex.) introduced an FDDI card for VMEbus systems, theV/FDDI 3211 which also uses the AMD chipset.andP;  It costs $8,000 and isavailable now.andM;Bridges and RoutersandM;The company who throws its entire Ethernet to install FDDI will be a rareone.andP;  Instead, FDDI will be installed for users with the most stringentbandwidth demands, such as engineers.andP;  Or it will be used as a campus-wide ormetropolitan-area backbone.andP;  In any case, FDDI must interface with the slewof existing networks.andP;  Bridges and routers will do the job.andP;  A number ofvendors have or will have FDDI bridges or routers, including cisco Systems,Fibermux, Fibronics, and In-Net.andM;The Menlo Park, Calif., manufacturer of routers, cisco Systems, insists itsrouter merely does FDDI.andP;  It is not an FDDI router, but rather a router thatcan attach to FDDI networks, says Sandy Lerner, the company's president andcofounder.andP;  The cisco router can handle 14 protocols, including TCP/IP, OSI,XNS, DECnet, AppleTalk, Domain, X.25, and IPX.andM;The router may connect workstations or subnetworks to an FDDI network.andP;  Therouter operates in cisco's new high-speed AGS router chassis, which adds a533M-bits-per-second &quot;cBus&quot; backplane to the earlier AGS chassis' Multibusbackplane that supports two new FDDI modules: a cBus controller card and aClass A FDDI interface card.andP;  Up to two FDDI interfaces can be installed.andO;The architecture not only supports Token Ring and Ethernet networks butconnects FDDI networks at the 100M-bits-per-second speed.andM;The cisco router uses two VSLI components from the AMD's SuperNet FDDI chipset: the AM 79C83 Fiber Optic Ring Media Control (FORMAC) and the AM 7984AEncoder Decoder (ENDEC).andP;  The router is priced at $38,000 and will beavailable in the first quarter of 1990.andM;Fibronics (Hyannis, Mass.) had the first commercially available line of FDDIproducts.andP;  The company's FX8210 MAC-layer bridges are capable of connectingan Ethernet subnetwork to an FDDI backbone.andP;  The bridges perform frameencapsulation and stripping so that the packet is forwarded transparentlyfrom LAN to LAN.andM;An FX8210 with a dual Ethernet interface costs $11,500.andP;  Fibronics recentlydebuted a Token Ring interface that connects a Token Ring subnet to FDDI'sdual rings.andP;  The Token Ring interface modules can be combined with theEthernet interfaces in the FX8210 or FX8310.andM;The FX8310, which is part of the new 8300 Series, is the latest addition.andO;The FX8310 is a TCP/IP router for FDDI dual-ring networks.andP;  The 8300 Seriesincludes a performance booster that increases the filtering rate of itsFDDI-to-LAN bridge to 22,000 packets per second.andP;  Finally, an internal,laser-powered distance extender allows the nodes on a System Finex network tobe up to 20 kilometers apart.andM;Fibermux (Chatsworth, Calif.) also offers Ethernet and Token Ring bridges anda TCP/IP router.andP;  The first FDDI device available in Fibermux's FX5500 Seriesis the FX5510T Token Ring Source Routing Bridge.andP;  The FX5510 is a MAC-layerbridge that connects Token Ring networks to an FDDI network.andP;  This bridgeuses source routing, which determines the best course to the destinationimplemented by IBM.andM;For those who favor Ethernet, Fibermux has the FX5520Z to bridge Ethernetsubnetworks to an FDDI ring.andP;  Like all MAC-layer bridges, the Fibermux bridgeautomatically configures a table of which network addresses are local, sopackets can be sent to their destinations swiftly.andM;For those demanding a higher level of security or management control,Fibermux has a TCP/IP router for Ethernet networks.andP;  The FX5530Z routespackets between TCP/IP LANs connected to the FDDI ring, allowing hosts,workstations, and terminals to interoperate across it.andM;Both the Fibermux Ethernet bridge and router offer a redundant configurationcalled &quot;standby node,&quot; which allows for an extra node to be placed in standbystatus and is activated if the primary node fails.andP;  This eliminates the needfor a redundant router or bridge module.andM;Pricing for the FX5500 Series stations begins at $22,000.andP;  The San Diego,Calif.-based In-Net, another FDDI company, makes bridges to connectsubnetworks to an FDDI backbone.andP;  The FiberTalk 5000 802.3 and 802.5 LocalBridge connects Ethernet and Token Ring subnetworks to an FDDI backbone.andM;Attaching MainframesandM;Yet another application for FDDI is to connect mainframes to each other or totheir peripherals.andP;  In this configuration, the FDDI cable is attached to oneof the mainframe's I/O channels, which provides speedy service.andM;Besides offering bridges in its FiberTalk line, In-Net manufacturers theFiberTalk 3000 Channel Extension Unit (CEU), a channel-to-peripheral I/Odevice controller to link multiple IBM hosts on an FDDI backbone.andP;  Up to 16CEUs can be connected on a single ring, with 2,048 logical data links.andP;  Thehosts and peripherals can communicate without special software or switches.andO;The CEUs can be placed up to two kilometers apart on the FDDI ring withoutrepeaters.andM;While the CEU allows the peripherals to be connected to the mainframe usingFDDI, the FiberTalk 3000 Channel Interface Unit (CIU) connects IBM hostsdirectly to each other via their I/O channel.andP;  As with the CEU, there can be16 CIUs, placed up to two kilometers apart on a single ring.andP;  The CIU can belocated up to 400 feet away from the host and two or more CIUs can beconnected to one host channel.andM;Part of Fibronics' System Finex permits mainframes to be attached to an FDDInetwork.andP;  The FX8222 FDDI Control Unit connects an IBM 370, 43xx, 30xxmainframe to an FDDI network.andP;  It sustains throughout at a rate of 4.5M bitsper second and transfers data on the mainframe channel at speeds up to 3Mbytes per second.andP;  The control unit uses AMD's VLSI chip set Part of the new8300 Series, the FX8322 Mainframe Channel Attached Network Controllerattaches a mainframe channel directly to an FDDI LAN.andP;  Any devices attachedto the LAN can then access the mainframe over TCP/IP.andM;The FX8400 FDDI Extender increases the nominal distance between FDDImultimode fiber optic stations from two kilometers to a maximum of 40kilometers using single-mode fiber-optic media.andP;  This allows100M-bits-per-second FDDI networks to be used in Metropolitan Area Networksor in campus areas.andM;Just ManagingandM;When assembling such a large internetwork, as FDDI will necessarily be,network management is even more important.andP;  Many of these companies offersoftware to manage their bridges, routers, and mainframe attachments so thata network administrator can get a handle on the network.andM;Fibronics' FX2510 Network Management System provides monitoring, control, anddiagnostic functions for the System Finex FDDI network, including allbridges, routers, and mainframe products.andP;  the system provides monitoring,fault isolation, and capacity planning.andP;  It collects network statistics andchecks the performance of other System Finex interfaces, such as the IEEE802.3 bridge or TCP/IP router.andM;Each workstation on System Finex can be configured from the NMS PC.andP;  This isespecially important in light of the unfinished Station Management portion.andO;Upgrades to the firmware can simply be downloaded and replicated across thenetwork.andP;  NMS can display all station parameters and generate a network-widemap of all workstations on the FDDI ring.andP;  Since the FX2510 uses adistributed architecture, any workstation can be used as a monitoring stationby attaching a PC running the FX8510 software through an RS-232 link.andM;Fibermux offers network management.andP;  The SS5502 Network Station Management(NSM) software resides on a PS/2, AT, or XT and provides monitoring,diagnostic and control functions including traffic monitoring, networktiming, fault detection, and subnetwork bridge and router management.andP;  Thesystem maintains detailed logs of network events and activity and providescolor displays (where possible) and three levels of security.andP;  More than oneNSM station can be active within a single ring.andP;  Additionally, the NSMcontains the operating software and configurations for the subnetworks.andP;  TheNSM is priced at $8,000.andM;The FiberTalk 1000 Network Management System oversees the products inIn-Net's line.andP;  Network Management System provides centralized networkmanagement and control services that monitor the network.andP;  The NetworkManagement System operates on a color IBM platform, and future plans includeNetView compatibility with a keyboard or mouse interface.andP;  The systemnaturally has printer support for hard copies of network statistics.andP;  Thereports are time and date stamped for unattended operation.andM;The EssentialsandM;While interface cards and routers may gain the glory, without chips,connectors, and cable, an FDDI network is nothing.andP;  Most vendors areimplementing FDDI products using Advanced Micro Devices' (Sunnyvale, Calif.)andO;SuperNet chipset, but there will be other suppliers.andP;  For one, Motorola(Austin, Texas) and DEC (Maynard, Mass.) announced they will develop an FDDIchipset that Motorola will manufacture and market.andP;  The initialfour-component chip set will be available in 1990.andM;BerkTek makes 62.5/125 micron fiber, the type of cable specified in FDDI.andO;This New Holland, Penn.-based company makes hybrid LAN cable that includesone through six optical fiber pairs that are FDDI compatible.andP;  The TPPFSeries not only has fiber cable but cable suitable for Token Ring andEthernet networks as well.andP;  BerkTek's PD Series of tight-buffered fiber opticcables features all-dielectric construction and a flame-retardant sheath.andM;The company's composite fiber and copper cable consists of two 62.5/125 fiberoptic cables and two individually shielded copper pairs for datatransmission.andP;  Although the price is comparable to that of the fiber andcopper cables separately, you do save on installation costs.andM;With the final decision made on the fixed-shroud connector by the X3T9.5committee, Fotec (Boston, Mass.) has a fiber optic test kit for FDDI.andP;  TheT310-FDDI tests cable plant loss, bypass switches, and system operatingpower.andP;  Like the company's other fiber optic test kits, it offers a powermeter, S370 dual wavelength source, and accessories such as an FDDI testcable using two 62.5/125 fibers connectorized with an FDDI connector on oneend and a pair of ST connectors on the other.andP;  the combination allows fortesting FDDI components that use the FDDI connector and patch panels, whichusually use the single-fiber ST connector.andM;The company also has introduced an adapter that allows its fiber opticinstruments to be used directly with the FDDI connector.andP;  The A251 is used onboth meters and sources to adapt instruments to over 60 connectors and barefibers.andP;  The adapter costs $150.andM;PCO (Chatsworth, Calif.) announced its support for the internationalmultisourcing agreement for FDDI-compliant optical transceivers.andP;  PCO willindependently design and manufacture FDDI transceivers to meet the commonpackage and pinout standards proposed by Hewlett-Packard, Siemens, and ATandamp;T.andM;Caveat EmptorandM;When choosing a vendor for FDDI products, it is important to look at whooffers the entire system.andP;  FDDI will be a standard, but it is embryonictoday.andP;  Unit the standard settles down, you cannot wildly swap a vendor'sequipment with another's.andP;  The many MAC-layer bridges and TCP/IP routers fromdifferent vendors are not necessarily interoperable, and Ethernet has been astandard for much longer.andP;  Widespread interoperability certainly will not bepossible until the station management portion becomes standard.andM;Whereas only proprietary ways have been available until now, FDDI is astandard method to solve the bandwidth crunch.andP;  It provides the speed,redundancy, and management to build a metropolitan area network, a backbonenetwork, or even a high-performance local network.andP;  And we are on thethreshold of FDDI becoming more product than talk.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
