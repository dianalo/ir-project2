Our decision to market typewriters through our dealer network does not mean we are &quot;backing away from the typewriter business.&quot; On the contrary, our dealer network gives us a cost-effective way to market and service IBM typewriters. Our typewriter dealers receive high customer-satisfaction ratings, and we expect our relationship with them to grow even stronger.    The fact is, we are firmly committed to the typewriter business -- a commitment underscored by the significant investment we've made in our automated manufacturing plant in Lexington, Ky. That plant turns out the IBM Wheelwriters 3 and 6, the best-selling office typewriters in the U.S. As further evidence of our commitment, we recently announced the Wheelwriter 10 Series II, an innovative typewriter that has been extremely well received by our dealers and our customers.    Typewriters continue to be an important business for IBM, and we intend to enhance and extend our product line in the future.    George H. Conrades   Senior Vice President and General Manager   IBM Personal Systems   International Business Machines Corp.    White Plains, N.Y. </TEXT></DOC>
