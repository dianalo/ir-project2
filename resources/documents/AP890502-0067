(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A skinhead has pleaded guilty to murder inthe slaying of a black man whose head was struck so hard with abaseball bat that the bat split.   Kenneth M. Mieske, 23, who went by the nicknames ``Ken Death''and ``Batman,'' entered the plea Monday in the slaying of MulugetaSeraw, 27, an Ethiopian national. Mieske said he and others killedSeraw on Nov. 13 ``because of his race.''   Mieske also pleaded no contest to racial intimidation in thenon-fatal stabbing of a black security guard at a supermarket lastSeptember.   Prosecutors plan to seek a life sentence with a mandatoryminimum term of 20 years on the murder conviction, according to aplea agreement between Mieske and the Multnomah County DistrictAttorney's office. Mieske agreed not to challenge the sentence.   ``This sends a very strong message to anyone who wants to commitracist crimes in Portland, Oregon, and we hope that never happensagain,'' said Deputy District Attorney Norman W. Frink Jr. ``Idon't think we could have gotten anything better if we'd gone totrial.''   Multnomah County Circuit Judge Philip T. Abraham set sentencingfor June 5. Mieske was to have gone to trial May 8.   His lawyer, Randy Vogt, said Mieske agreed to plead guiltypartly because federal authorities were threatening to prosecutehim for civil rights offenses that could have resulted in a lifesentence with no parole.   Mieske could have been prosecuted in federal court even if he'dgone to trial and been convicted on the state charges, Vogt said.Under the plea agreement, federal authorities won't prosecuteMieske if he accepts the sentencing recommendation, the attorneysaid.   Kyle H. Brewster, 19, and Steven R. Strasser, 20, are stillawaiting trial in Seraw's death. They are charged with murder,assault and racial intimidation.   Seraw was beaten to death outside his southeast Portlandapartment after two fellow Ethiopians brought him home from a party.   According to police testimony, Mieske hit Seraw in the back ofthe head with a baseball bat three times, fracturing Seraw's skulland splitting the bat.   Mieske wore his hair short in the skinhead style. Some, but notall, skinheads are racists.   Ron Herndon, a community leader who attended Monday's hearing onbehalf of Seraw's family, called the plea bargain fair, but wasuncertain whether it would help deter racist violence by ``sickpeople.''   ``I can't predict insanity,'' Herndon said.</TEXT></DOC>
