The influence of inhibitors like alcohols,glycols or salts on the hydrate formation is accounted for by a veryflexible and robust program based on the method. The calculated resultsare found to compare well with experimental results for a wide varietyof pure compounds and mixtures, including two North Sea reservoir fluids.</TEXT></DOC>
