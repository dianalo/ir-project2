Ecuador's interior minister, Heinz Moeller, also assailed thestatements attributed to Elliot Abrams, assistant secretary ofstate for Latin American affairs, that were published in theArgentine newspaper La Nacion earlier this week.   La Nacion said that in the interview conducted in Buenos Aires,Abrams was asked about threats to fragile Latin Americandemocracies. It quoted him as saying that in meetings with LatinAmerican leaders he is frequently told that Peru and Ecuador arethe most worrisome cases.   Peru's Foreign Ministry issued a communique saying it has``presented its protest and solicited an explanation'' from theUnited States involving statements made in Buenos Aires two dayspreviously ``regarding the existence of dangers of a coup in Peru.''   It added: ``Apart from being intrinsically erroneous, thosedeclarations constitute inadmissible interference in internalmatters that deserves our energetic rejection.''   Moeller said Thursday, ``Mr. Abrams is damaging the democraticprocess with his declarations.''   There was no comment from the U.S. embassies in Lima and Quito.   There are occasional rumors of possible coups in both Andeannations, which are suffering severe economic problems. Peru also isbattling left-wing rebels in a revolt that has claimed more than10,000 lives since 1980.   Peruvian congressmen from various political parties discardedthe chances of a military coup against the centrist government ofPresident Alan Garcia.   Political leaders in Ecuador also dimissed the possibility of acoup against conservative President Leon Febres Cordero.   Both countries had military governments during the 1970s.Democracy was restored in Ecuador in 1979 and in Peru in 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
