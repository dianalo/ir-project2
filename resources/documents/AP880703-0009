The new Long March 4 has a propelling power of 300 tons and thecapability of putting a 2.5-ton payload into orbit, the officialXinhua News Agency said late Saturday.   Aeronautics officials hope the new rocket will help attract moreforeign customers for China's nearly 3-year-old satellite launchservice, which despite cut-rate prices has only one customer undercontract.   China has launched 22 of its own satellites in the past 18 yearsusing the Long March 1, 2 and 3 rockets.   Most recently, the Long March 3 sent a communications satelliteinto orbit that China said would double domestic communicationscapacity.   The Long March 3 was introduced in April 1984. It can put up to1.4-ton load in long-distance orbit and up to 3 tons inlow-altitude orbit.   The Xinhua report quoted Chen Shouchun, chief engineer of theGreat Wall Industrial Corp., China's launch company, as saying theNo. 3 rocket uses advanced low-temperature technology applied inonly a few other countries.   He did not give any details about the new Long March 4.   Xinhua said in November that scientists had modified the LongMarch 3 to nearly double its launch capabilities. It was not clearif that modified version was the same as the Long March 4.   China announced its international launch service in October1985, hoping to take advantage of the halt in the U.S. spaceshuttle and European launching programs caused by accidents.   The Great Wall Industrial Corp. has reported numerous inquiriesfrom potential foreign customers, but only one, Sweden Space Co.,has signed a formal contract.   China agreed in December to launch a scientific andtelecommunications satellite for Sweden using the Long March 2. Nodate has been set.   Last month, China signed a tentative agreement with a consortiumof three Chinese, British and Hong Kong companies to launch acommunications satellite to serve Asia.   Similar non-binding launch agreements with two U.S. companies,Teresat Inc. And Pan American Pacific Corp., subsequently fellthrough.</TEXT></DOC>
