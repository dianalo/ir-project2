Douglas Kahn, president and CEO of Interactive Images, expectsa new version of its Easel program development software for OS-2will boost the development of applications for OS-2.andP;  Easel hasbecome an integral part of IBM's Systems Applications Architecturebecause the software allows programmers to develop graphical userinterfaces for current applications.andP;  Easel now provides userinterfaces for DOS applications, and the OS-2 Extended Editionversion will provide a means for applications developers workingwith SAA and Presentation Manager.andP;  IBM, which has invested inInteractive Images, will use Easel to provide graphical userinterfaces for some of its mainframe and minicomputer hosts.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Interactive Images Inc.
