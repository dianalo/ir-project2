CarlVuono, the U.S. Army's chief of staff, received a glowingreport about its lessons.   Nearly everything the U.S. and its allies used againstIraq -- the air-land strategy, the high-tech weapons, thesize and mix of the all-volunteer forces -- seemedspectacularly successful, according to the study team'spreliminary conclusions. Outside analysts agree. &quot;It'sunbelievable,&quot; says John Keegan, a British militaryhistorian. &quot;It's a hell of a situation when everything worksso well.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   When the euphoria drifts away with the smoke of thebattlefield, though, military analysts will begin a morerigorous examination of what happened in the greatestmismatch in modern warfare.   While they will find extraordinary achievements, they alsowill find that U.S. forces suffered a variety of problems,ranging from a shortage of ships to move heavy equipment tothe battlefield to night-vision goggles that kept falling offsoldiers' helmets. Some of the snafus could have put lives inperil had the war lasted longer or been waged against a moredetermined and better-trained enemy.   What worked best was allied air power. Unopposed by theIraqi air force, it provided the margin of victory,challenging the belief that air power can't win a war byitself.   The scope and precision of the around-the-clock airstrikes devastated Iraqi's military; it destroyed SaddamHussein's command-and-control facilities, wiped out hisweapons factories, and in the end broke the Iraqi army's willto fight. &quot;We could not move outside our bunkers because theykept hitting us around the clock,&quot; says an Iraqi soldier.&quot;And when there was a lull in the bombardment, we felt luckyand went out only to find a place to bury our fellows whowere killed.&quot;   More than ever before, the army called on air power, too.In the climactic battles against the Republican Guard, U.S.ground commanders called in tank-killing jets, chiefly theferocious A-10s, and Apache helicopters to blast a path foradvancing heavy armored columns.   But it wasn't picture-perfect. Apaches came close torunning out of fuel when the tanks they were supportingoutraced supply lines. Sometimes, the A-10s would circleenemy tanks like hawks, lingering over their targets for aslong as 45 minutes. Soldiers watching the performance stoodtransfixed as the jets finally made their runs, their gunsmaking a deep, unforgettable roar as the enemy tanks weredemolished. If the Iraqis had been able to maintain even arudimentary air-defense system, U.S. pilots never could haveused such slow-motion tactics.   Moreover, after several cases of &quot;friendly fire,&quot; the Army-- which had spent millions repainting its vehicles deserttan -- put fluorescent orange sheets over many of them andhad U.S. troops wear special tape on their arms that gave offinfrared signals so the Apaches wouldn't go after them. Thissuggests the need for ground forces to develop a systemsimilar to the electronic IFF (Identification Friend or Foe)system that allows U.S. pilots to tell allied and enemyplanes apart.   There were other problems in the air as well. Bad weatherand smoke from burning oil wells obscured targets andstretched out the air war weeks longer than anticipated.British pilots were forced to abandon some low-level bombingtactics after several of their planes were shot down ordamaged.   Early reports suggest that the performance of the giganticB-52, the grandfather of U.S. bombers, was disappointing.Early in the war, they were used to hit chemical andmunitions storage sites; they were used again later to keepIraqi heads down as the Marines smashed their way to KuwaitCity. But in attacking enemy armor, U.S. commanders turnedaway from the big bomber and relied more and more on F-16sand other smaller jets carrying precision-guided missiles.   Communications and logistics were both triumphs of U.S.planning and ingenuity. U.S. commanders knew almosteverything about the enemy; the enemy knew almost nothingabout the alliance. Awacs radar-surveillance planes andJ-Stars ground-targeting aircraft gave U.S. commandersinstant combat information. Persistent bombing and jamming soblinded the Iraqis that Saddam Hussein was eventually reducedto using couriers to communicate with some of his commandersin the field.   As for logistics -- the supply train -- U.S. soldiersreceived baskets of fresh fruit in their foxholes daily,while Iraqis, dehydrated and ill, sometimes had nothing morethan rainwater and grass. To support the huge flankingmovement that ultimately cut off the Republican Guard, theArmy brought in thousands of truck drivers and moved enoughammunition, food and other supplies to sustain 250,000 men inthe field for two months.   The success of the logistics operation points to stillanother lesson to be learned from the war: 80,000 reservistsin the Gulf made a difference.   Though often derided by the regulars for their inabilityto find their way home in the dark or their all-thumbsproblems in putting up a tent, the reservists -- many of themwomen -- served a vital support role. They flew planes, drovetrucks, guarded prisoners and cared for the sick. Thereservists, says Army Gen. Vuono, &quot;worked out magnificently.&quot;   But if reservists did well in support, three Army reservebrigades that were called up to serve in front-line combatroles never made it to the front. Defense Secretary DickCheney and his top aides decided they weren't well-trainedenough to do the job -- a decision that may have implicationsdown the line when budget pressures shrink the U.S. military.   The swift Army flanking movement that was the highlight ofthe battle will be studied in military classrooms for yearsto come. But getting the troops and the tanks to the battletheater in a timely fashion wasn't nearly so successful. Thebig problem was rickety cargo ships that make up the U.S.'sReady Reserve fleet. Some of them had mechanical problemsbefore they went to sea; others broke down en route,prompting immense concern among U.S. military commanders. Tohurry things along, the U.S. chartered some foreign ships.One of them, originally East German, made the trip at anaverage speed of four knots.   Nearly two weeks after the war began, the Third ArmoredDivision near the Kuwaiti border was still awaiting half ofits M-1 tanks and a third of its helicopters. &quot;We took it tothe wire,&quot; says Brig. Gen. Steven Arnold, the U.S. CentralCommand's top planning and operations officer. A possiblesolution for the future: Preposition tanks and other heavyequipment in places where they might one day be needed. Inthe Middle East, likely sites would be Saudi Arabia and Oman.   Once it reached the Gulf, the heavy equipment -- includingthe often-criticized M-1 -- performed better in thedifficult, wind-blown conditions than many people hadanticipated. &quot;It has a lot of expensive bolts in it,&quot; saysone tank commander, &quot;but, dammit, we just got paid back.&quot; Itwas also a good war for older equipment -- artillery, oftenneglected by military planners; rocket launchers; evennapalm.   Careful training paid off, too. Commanders laid out thebattlefield in designs in the sand, and then ran theirofficers through what they called &quot;rubber duck&quot; drills, eachofficer representing his whole unit. The officers were alittle self-conscious, shuffling through this minuet on adesert floor marked with paper planes and plastic tape, butit helped.   Taking a long look at the war, some think-tank scholarsbelieve now is the time to begin considering a sweepingreview of the roles of the various military services. &quot;Letthem all bask in their glory now; they deserve it,&quot; saysMartin Binkin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.&quot;But this is the perfect time to look to the future.&quot; Forinstance, he says, it might be worthwhile to think aboutgiving the Army its own fixed-wing aircraft for groundsupport, a mission now performed by the Air Force.   Mr. Binkin would especially scrutinize what he calls the&quot;twin obsessions&quot; -- the Army's obsession with fighting a waragainst the Soviet Union in Europe and the Marines' obsessionwith amphibious warfare. With the Soviets fading as amilitary threat, both Defense Secretary Cheney and Gen. ColinPowell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, increasinglyemphasize the threat posed by regional, second-tier powers.In that kind of combat, U.S. troops might once again beengaged in combating guerrilla warfare, something with whichthe U.S. military is still not comfortable.   The Marines have emphasized amphibious warfare sincebefore World War II, but they haven't made an opposedamphibious landing since Korea. In this war, two Marinedivisions fought a ground battle with their usual skill andbravery. But the Marines also had 17,000 troops on ships inthe Persian Gulf, braced to make an amphibious landing, whowere never sent ashore. The Marines argue that the threatthey posed was as effective as an actual landing, because ittied down thousands of Iraqi troops. But the fact that thesetroops weren't committed to the fighting is sure to renew theold argument about the proper role of the Marine Corps.   This much is certain, though: the Marines, one way oranother, will survive. &quot;Americans,&quot; says Mr. Binkin, &quot;have alove affair with the Marines.&quot;   ---   Bob Davis and John J.
