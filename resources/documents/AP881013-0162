After two hours of haggling at this truce village inside theDemilitarized Zone separating their nations, delegates agreed tomeet again Nov. 17.   ``The northern side took an insincere stand throughout, andthere was no progress,'' Lee Han-dong, a South Korean delegate andparliamentarian, told a news conference after the meeting.   Chon Kum Chol, the chief North Korean negotiator, said: ``TheSouth's position was basically the same as before, and they made noconcessions at all.''   The two Koreas, meeting for the first time since the Olympicsended Oct. 2 in Seoul, made some changes in their positions, butneither side showed willingness to make major concessions.   Delegates first shook hands over a new conference table andexchanged small talk. Previously, the table was so wide they couldnot reach across for handshakes.   The cordial mood quickly dissipated as both sides exchangedtesty statements, accusing each other of insincere efforts to findways reunite the Korean Peninsula, which was divided in 1945.   Thursday's meeting, the fifth since Aug. 21, was called toprepare for proposed main talks between the Koreas' legislatures onnon-aggression and other peace measures.   North Korea suggested the main talks include one-third of thelawmakers from the North, or 218 people, and half of the South'slawmakers, or 150 people. That was a change from previous meetings,at which North Korea demanded a joint meeting of all the nearly1,000 lawmakers of the two sides.   South Korea wants a smaller meeting. It called for largelyceremonial opening and closing sessions attended by all legislatorsof both sides and a smaller session for the actual negotiations.   The two sides differ widely over the proposed agenda.   The communist North is putting more emphasis on a non-aggressionstatement. Seoul officials say the statement seeks the withdrawalfrom South Korea of 42,000 U.S. troops stationed there.   The South wants to discuss the possibility of setting up asummit between the nations' leaders. North Korean delegates opposethis as an agenda item.   The first talks were held Aug. 21. The sides began far apart andneither has made significant concessions. At the fourth sessionAug. 26, both sides blamed each other for blocking progress butagreed to meet again after the Olympics.   North Korea accused South Korea on Thursday of ``having left astain on the nation's history by hosting the Olympics alone inSeoul.''   ``The Olympics are supposed to be a festival of peace and goodwill,'' Chon said. By having the Olympics alone, he said SouthKorea ``split the nation.''   North Korea wanted to share the Olympics, but the InternationalOlympic Committee said the Games are awarded to a single city andcannot be shared.</TEXT></DOC>
