At sister churches in Leipzig and Dresden, East Germans who havebeen refused permission to emigrate to the West gather weekly forcandle-light vigils to protest the government's decision to makethem stay.   Thousands of East Germans have recently spilled out of thechurches and into the streets as protests against the agingCommunist leadership's hard-line policies have swelled to recordproportions.   Suddenly, the church has been plunged into the middle of effortsto achieve political reforms in one of Eastern Europe's mosttightly-controlled societies.   The church has long sought an uneasy co-existence with the40-year-old, officially atheist state.   The most recent figures available from East Germany say thatbetween 45 and 48 percent of the population belonged to religiouscommunities in 1987. About 39 percent of the population areLutherans. Martin Luther, leader of the Protestant Reformation, wasborn in Eisleben, now in East Germany.   While it has championed human rights causes and increasinglypressured the government for more openness and dialogue in society,the Lutheran Church has largely steered clear of open confrontationwith the state.   East German officials have tolerated the church as long as itconfines itself to activities on its property, although itspublications are routinely censored.   After years of relative tranquility, church leaders have foundthemselves in tense mediations with police to prevent protests fromescalating into violence. Their run-down churches have increasinglybecome forums for disparate opposition groups and pro-democracysupporters.   Church leaders are also speaking out more boldly for democraticchange.   Hans Otto Furian, a church provost in East Berlin, has called onthe ruling Communist Party to ``give up its grip on total power.''   Church sources inform Western media of dissident developmentsand act as mediators between opposition groups and governmentofficials.   Opposition groups have flocked to the churches because they arethe only haven of free speech in the strictly regulated country.   Church property is also off-limits to state security officialsunder terms of a law separating church and state.   While there are similarities to the Catholic Church's support ofthe Solidarity movement in Poland, the German Lutheran Church hasnever had the same influence on daily life as the Catholic Churchin Poland.   Western diplomatic observers and East German church leaders saythere are clear limits to the church's new role. Many say itscurrent role has been assumed reluctantly.   ``The church has not deliberately chosen this role,'' said aWestern diplomat who tracks East German religious affairs. ``It wasforced upon it.''   East Berlin pastor Rainer Eppelmann said the church, in seekingto help many East Germans disillusioned by their society, has foundthat ``people we're trying to reach out to are being torn apart.''   ``You have to deal with these problems,'' said Eppelmann, whowas among the first East Berlin pastors to give sanctuary tofledgling ecology and human rights groups.   Johannes Hempel, the Lutheran bishop of Dresden, said he doesnot believe the church is actively seeking the forefront of themovement for changes in East German society.   ``What is happening now is not really an activity of thechurches,'' he said. ``It comes from a large part of thepopulation, and only a small part are Christians.''   Hempel said the church's role is to help ``avoid escalation andviolence'' and to build bridges between the opposition and thestate.   That role will be challenged as opposition leaders continue todemand more dialogue with the government.   So far, only Communist officials in Leipzig and Dresden haveagreed to talk to opposition representatives. Church leaders thereplayed key roles in setting up those talks.   Church leaders in East Berlin say ``working groups'' also existbetween the church and officials in the capital to discusssolutions to the current unrest.   Several church leaders are known to have good contacts withhigh-ranking party officials.   Church officials say they expect their mediation role tocontinue to be a difficult one because many in the government ledby 77-year-old Erich Honecker have been unwilling to discuss theneed for changes.</TEXT></DOC>
