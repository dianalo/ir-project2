Budd Jr.'s April 16 Manager'sJournal: Plaudits to Mr. Budd for an excellent article. Itshould be required reading for every corporate executive.Clearly, when even senior managers do not trust their CEOs,we have a serious problem.   This is, however, not difficult to understand. When wehave been exposed to the arrogance of Exxon following theValdez incident and the incompetence of the Drexel BurnhamLambert crowd, how can we feel kindly toward largecorporations? When we have seen some of our major trademarkssold at auction by the likes of Henry Kravis, T. BoonePickens and Frank Lorenzo, is it not difficult to believe inthe social conscience of businessmen? When GM lost more than10% of the world auto market in the past decade, how do wecontinue to accept that &quot;What is good for General Motors isgood for the USA&quot;?</LP><TEXT>   The reputation of our politicians was damaged seriously bythe Watergate incident. Will the believability of ourexecutives suffer the same fate as a result of incidents suchas those mentioned above? Yes, corporate America needs toimprove its image. It also needs to improve its act or itsattempts at image enhancement will be only meaningless PRgestures.   Richard A. Gwennap   Pittsburgh</TEXT></DOC>
