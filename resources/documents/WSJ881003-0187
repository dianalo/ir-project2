Rundle (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LK LABOR GOVMT </CO><IN> ARO </IN><G> DEF </G><TEXT>   Lockheed Corp. said two federal agencies have launched investigations into claims by some workers at Lockheed's Burbank, Calif., plant that chemicals or other materials used in the facility's secret projects endanger their health.    Some of the workers are employed at Lockheed's &quot;Skunk Works,&quot; believed to be where a highly classified Stealth fighter is being built. The employees have complained that the secret nature of their jobs has hurt their efforts to seek medical treatment from private physicians.    In Burbank, a spokesman for the Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. unit of the aerospace company wouldn't comment on the worker claims, citing related litigation pending against the company. The parent company is based in Calabasas, Calif.    Although neither Lockheed nor the Defense Department has confirmed the existence of the Stealth fighter program, analysts say the planes are being constructed from composite materials and other substances that don't reflect radar. Employee suits have claimed that the materials may be hazardous and that Lockheed's facilities haven't been adapted to the hazards.    Lockheed's view, according to a person close to the company, is that &quot;there isn't any indication that there is anything much different about these materials from what could be found at other industrial companies.&quot;    On Thursday, a three-member team from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration arrived at Lockheed to investigate worker complaints of headaches, memory loss, high blood pressure, cancer and other medical problems. One of the inspectors has the necessary security clearances to go into classified areas.    The Lockheed spokesman said the company was notified Thursday that &quot;a five-member team from the Department of Defense would be coming out from Wright Patterson Air Force Base.&quot; He said the team might arrive as early as today.    The OSHA on-site inspection is expected to take &quot;two or three weeks,&quot; said Frank Strasheim, regional OSHA administrator in San Francisco. He said the agency began its investigation after evaluating published reports of the worker complaints.    About 75 employees are plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in 1986 in state court in Burbank, charging that the workers suffered from ailments brought on by hazardous substances used in their top-secret jobs. Five plaintiffs reportedly died from work-related illnesses. In addition to the lawsuit, the Lockheed spokesman said, about 150 employees have filed worker compensation claims.    A spokesman for the International Association of Machinists, which represents about 6,500 Lockheed employees, said the union has received hundreds of grievances related to the toxic substance concerns. He said it was difficult to assess the magnitude of the problem because workers are barred by their security clearances from talking &quot;even with their doctors.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
