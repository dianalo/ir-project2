The Urraca battalion, entrusted with the security of PanamanianDefense Forces headquarters, is in revolt.   The sounds are heard at the headquarters of the U.S. SouthernCommand, less than a mile away.   Hundreds of people living near the embattled headquarters leaveor are forced from their homes, some fleeing with pets and all thehousehold belongings they can carry.   Police, armored personnel carriers and water cannon block thestreets, keeping journalists and the curious away. Shops pull downtheir shutters.   At 7:20 a.m., the Southern Command puts its troops and civilianson the highest alert. President Bush, in Washington, is informed.   Gunfire crackles through the morning. Stray bullets hitbuildings in the neighborhood, but no civilian injuries arereported. The Red Cross says doctors have been called to thecompound.   U.S. troops in combat gear take up positions 600 yards from theDefense Forces headquarters, between the gunfire and U.S. bases.However, they take no part in the fighting.   U.S. helicopter gunships and Blackhawk troop carriers fly overthe installations. U.S. troops and armored personnel carriers closethe Bridge of the Americas, which crosses the Panama Canal west ofPanama City.   As the morning wears on, National Security adviser BrentScowcroft briefs Bush and visiting President Carlos Salinas deGortari of Mexico.   Former Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, also in Washington,says discontented officers who were passed over for recentpromotions were attempting the coup.   Meanwhile, troops loyal to Noriega are moving out of theirbarracks. Battalion 2000, named for the year Panama is to gaincontrol of the Panama Canal, leaves Fort Cimarron, 25 miles east ofthe city; the Machos de Monte come from Rio Hato, 55 miles west.   At 11:30 a.m., as sporadic gunfire continues, the rebels issuetheir first and only communique in the name of Maj. Moises GiraldiVega, commander of the Urraca battalion.   In a radio broadcast, the rebels say Noriega and six of his topcolonels have been ousted. The rebels call on other Defense Forcesunits to join them and say they will call elections soon.   Opposition supporters hit the streets to celebrate, waving flagsand blowing whistles, but half an hour later officers loyal toNoriega call a television station and say they are fighting back``ready to give their lives.''   Troops loyal to Noriega have climbed to the rooftops outside thecompound to bombard rebel soldiers with mortars, grenades andgunfire. The Urraca unit returns the fire.   At about 12:30 p.m. machine gun, bazooka and mortar fire ripsthrough the neighborhood. A rocket crashes into a building, settingit afire, and anti-aircraft weapons fire wildly.   People run screaming in the street. The sound of the crossfireis punctuated by a man who yells, ``Stop sinning. Christ is thesalvation.''   Noriega's forces are in control by about 1 p.m., althoughsporadic firing in the area continues for at least three hours.Captured rebel soldiers are lined up with their hands on theirheads; one is almost stripped naked.   In Washington, Bush says the United States has good relationswith the Defense Forces and its only argument is with Noriega. Healso says the coup attempt is not ``some American operation.''   By 3 p.m., Noriega spokesmen say the coup attempt has been putdown and the Defense Forces have confirmed their loyalty to thegeneral. Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez says severalpeople were wounded but says there were no deaths. He says at least60 soldiers and four or five officers have been detained.   The government announces an 8 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew. People flockto grocery stores, stocking up on supplies in case the situationdeteriorates.   Bush admits he is disappointed that the coup failed.   At about 4 p.m., Noriega and tells a national televisionaudience the coup attempt was part of the United States'``permanent aggression'' against Panama. He says all parts of thecountry are under control.   As darkness begins to fall, Noriega emerges from theheadquarters compound and waves to reporters. The fate of therebels is unknown.</TEXT></DOC>
