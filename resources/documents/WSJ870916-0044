Following a delay of nearly two hours, the Ariane 3, carrying two telecommunications satellites, soared into partly cloudy skies at 8:45 p.m. EDT from the Guiana Space Center in the South American jungle. The delay stemmed from problems with a pressure sensor that measures leakage in the third stage, which eventually ignited perfectly. Four of the previous 18 Ariane launches had failed, three of them because of problems in the third stage. Technicians had redesigned the third-stage engine.    About 20 minutes after liftoff, the rocket put into orbit the ECS-4 European telecommunications satellite and Aussat K-3, an Australian satellite.    Officials at Arianespace, the commercial satellite-launching arm of the space agency, had described last night's launch as a make-or-break venture that would determine the credibility of Ariane and of the entire European space program. Competition for international satellite-launching orders is keen.    At stake is a market estimated at $1 billion a year for the placing in geostationary orbit of about 200 telecommunications, meteorological, observation and military satellites between now and 1996. Last year's Challenger space shuttle disaster and President Reagan's subsequent decision to all but end the shuttle's role as a commercial satellite-launcher placed Ariane in a favorable position. But the Soviet Union and China have made bids to launch Western satellites, and Japan has announced plans to launch a powerful new rocket in 1992.    For the time being, Arianespace says it has a full order book, totaling 45 satellites, between now and the end of 1990. Arianespace last year had profit of 209 million French francs ($34.7 million) on revenue of 1.3 billion francs ($215.6 million), largely because the company receives payments on contracts three years in advance. But Arianespace is expected to only break even this year because Ariane was grounded most of this year. Revenue will remain at last year's level because the consortium continued to receive orders despite its problems, officials have said. Many of these contracts, however, hinge on Ariane's proving that its technical hitches are behind it.    Arianespace's president, Frederic d'Allest, said the Western world was closely watching last night's launch following the space industry's disastrous year in 1986. &quot;Due to the space shuttle accident and the grounding of Ariane, the whole Western world of satellite operators are very keen to see the resumption of Ariane flights,&quot; Mr. D'Allest said.    Toward that end, officials at the enginemaker Societe Europeenne de Propulsion had redesigned the third-stage engine, making its ignition system three times more powerful. Almost 70 tests were conducted on the engine, including 50 in simulated flight conditions. </TEXT></DOC>
