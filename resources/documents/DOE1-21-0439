Apart from pointing out theeffects of lubricating oils on the service life and efficiency of gasengines and on heat exchangers and catalytic converters the paper discussesfeasible ways of reducing the consumption of lubricating oils. The useof additives should be reduced in order to improve the long-term behaviourof engines. The use of synthetic oils is specifically beneficial to theengines. Apart from acid substances oils contain due to the presenceof nitrogen oxides in flue gases, ageing is mainly due to mean thermalloads. The use of ceramic components in the cylinder and piston areais expected to improve the prospects of lubricating systems. Apart fromresulting in longer service lives and even better efficiencies, ceramiccomponents will provide for another drastic reduction of the consumptionof lubricating oils.</TEXT></DOC>
