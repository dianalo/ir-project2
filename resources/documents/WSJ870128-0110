Traders gave the 4 7/8% bonds due 2000 a warm reception, but underwriters are watching recent issues managed by Switzerland's three big banks -- Credit Suisse, Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp. -- as an indication of a tough year ahead for foreign banks.    Some traders said they thought pricing on the Standard Oil issue was a bit tight, but they predicted a good showing on the market. Standard Oil is 55%-owned by British Petroleum Co.    &quot;Some people don't like the 13-year maturity,&quot; an underwriter said, &quot;but I think it should be OK. A 4 7/8% yield is what investors want right now.&quot;    Other Swiss franc issues launched yesterday were Electricite de France's 4 1/2% bonds due 1997 at 100 1/4, via Credit Suisse, and Chubu Electric Power Co.'s 4 5/8% bonds due 1997 at 99 3/4, to yield 4.66%, via Union Bank.    Underwriters outside the syndicates of the three Swiss banks see both issues as aggressively priced.    &quot;The big banks seem to be fighting it out,&quot; said one Geneva syndicate manager. &quot;They're fighting it out with cutthroat competition.&quot;    Electricite de France is generally considered a good name, and its infrequent appearance in the Swiss franc market usually ensures a good response when it issues debt in that market, traders said.    This issue, several managers said, was too aggressively priced. Electricite de France's 5 3/8% bonds due 1995 traded yesterday at 103 1/4 to yield 4.9%. In contrast, the issue launched yesterday yields 4.47%.    The tight pricing on issues managed by the three Swiss banks hasn't yet saturated the market because the lead managers are waiting before they sell.    &quot;There's not a lot of material on the market,&quot; a trader said. &quot;They're keeping it in-house and holding it back so they don't have to support it on the market.&quot;    Eurodollar bonds were little changed in one of the quietest days in recent weeks. Seasoned bonds ranged from flat to down 1/8 as participants pondered the direction of the U.S. dollar and the potential size of the U.S. trade deficit, which is scheduled to be reported Friday.    &quot;It's been deadly dull today,&quot; said a major European bank official. &quot;Most of the activity seems to be in the equities markets.&quot;    The Japanese trading company Itoman andamp; Co. launched what traders called &quot;a very successful&quot; $80 million equity warrant issue through Daiwa Europe Ltd. The bonds, due Feb. 24, 1992, were trading above their par issue price.    The issue's performance seemed to reflect a bias toward equity-linked debt, some market participants said.    In other issues, Bankers Trust International Ltd. recast $200 million of 7% Eurobonds due 1988 by Denmark as floating-rate notes priced at par, with a coupon of 1/16 point over the three-month London interbank offered rate, currently 6 1/4%.    A Bankers Trust official said the issue met &quot;good demand,&quot; with about 40% going to the Far East. &quot;This won't rejuvenate the entire floating-rate bond market, but it will provide a bit of good news there,&quot; he added.    Bankers Trust issued the notes through a newly created borrowing vehicle called trust obligations participating securities, known as Tops. </TEXT></DOC>
