(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In order to chart the course of thefast-growing personal computer mapping industry ... well, you'd needa map.   But one thing is clear even in the digital mapping maze _ thepersonal computer mapping industry is a multimillion-dollar business.   Companies are clamoring to stake their claim in the growingmarket, which is beginning to attract the interest and dollars ofsuch major investors as communications mogul Rupert Murdoch, whothis year bought a West Coast mapping firm.   The business centers on software and hardware that allowscompanies to integrate their own databases with maps they buy, or tocreate maps of their own. Software is available for less than $1,000.   ``Mapping has been around for 20 years really, but the peopleinvolved have been in forestry, land management, utilities ... notprofit-making organizations,'' said Lisa Thorell, formerly a mappingindustry analyst with Dataquest in San Jose, Calif. ``With peoplemoving mapping products to the PCs, the whole scene has changed.''   The applications are many because any company that hasinformation or assets that are geographically dispersed can utilizea map _ especially if it's displayed on a desktop computer. Andseeing information displayed geographically illustrates patternsthat may not be obvious from pie charts or rows and columns ofnumbers.   That's why one San Francisco outreach program now uses computermapping to help fight the spread of AIDS.   ``We keep track of a wide variety of very detailed informationabout our client contacts, including ethnic and sexual breakdowns.... And we're keeping track of the amounts of condoms, bleach andother disease-fighting agents we're putting out on the streets andwhere,'' said Eric Margolis, director of research for YouthEnvironment Study.   The information is then mapped, allowing the program's workers tosee the AIDS patterns each month and target their efforts.   Other possible uses might be by travel agents and auto clubs forplanning trips by clients, or by any business wanting to map andanalyze sales.   ``The industry is limited principally by the amount of moneypeople have to buy this stuff,'' Thorell said.   ``People with money in the commercial and financial area are veryinterested in seeing their data in map formats.''   There are more than 50 computer mapping systems on the market,ranging from multimillion-dollar systems to cheaper personalcomputer-based programs, according to H. Dennison Parker, publisherof the trade publication GIS World, based in Fort Collins, Colo.   Personal computer mapping is only a small portion of GIS _ orgeographic information systems _ technology that stores, overlaysand displays geographic and other types of data. While the simplestPC software can display information, the more elaborate GIS systemshave sophisticated analytical capabilities.   Dataquest reports that the entire computer mapping industry wasvalued at $592 million worldwide for 1988, of which $58 million waspersonal computer software and hardware. By 1992, Dataquest projectsthe overall market will grow to $948 million, of which $222 millionwill be the personal computer market segment.   Other mapping industry observers think the business is evenbigger and may grow even faster than that.   Michael Sena, president of Matrix Consultants in Boston,estimates the mapping market totaled $750 million in 1988 and willexpand to between $3.5 billion and $5 billion by 1992. Senaestimates that PC-based software and services may account for up to30 percent of that market.   Industry figures differ because they depend on how relatedproducts and services are divided up, but the consensus is that thebusiness is on an upswing.   ``I think that the industry is going to grow for another five to10 years easily. ... The applications for mapping software are justas broad as for desktop publishing,'' said Stephen Poizner,president of Strategic Locations Planning, in San Jose, Calif.   ``The 1990 census will provide an even greater boost to the wholedesktop mapping industry,'' Poizner said, because of the wealth ofinformation that will become available when it is released.   Charles Hart, president and chief executive officer of Etak,Inc., based in Menlo Park, Calif., agreed there was a strongparallel between desktop mapping and desktop publishing, which madecomputer publishing more accessible and sparked a boom in thatbusiness.   Etak began in 1983 as a company geared toward in-vehiclenavigation systems for cars. It has since entered and now emphasizesfleet management systems and geographical data systems, whichinclude digital map databases.   Etak is regarded as a leader in map digitizing, that is takingexisting maps and converting the information for computer use.   ``It's a new emerging market, people don't know what to make ofit,'' Hart said.   Earlier this year, Murdoch purchased Etak for an undisclosedprice said to be more than $30 million.   ``This is the first time a major player has gotten involved inthe mapping industry,'' Hart said.   Murdoch planned to utilize Etak's extensive map database inprojects like a worldwide reservation system, Hart said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday July 10</NOTE></DOC>
