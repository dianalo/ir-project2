The Irish ambassador expressed optimism one ormore hostages may be released soon.   ``Keep hanging in there,'' said one postcard from a student inColorado that was among the cards and letters the daily newspapersaid have arrived at its mailing address in Moslem west Beirut sinceDec. 1.   They are addressed to eight of the nine American hostages held inthe Lebanese capital. Only Edward Austin Tracy, a Vermont writer wholived in Lebanon for many years before his October 1986 kidnapping,did not receive any messages.   One letter signed by Rep. Donald J. Pease, D-Ohio, appeals to thecaptors to provide an address for letters to hostages.   ``Although it's not an easy period for you, I want you to knowthat you are always in our prayers,'' Pease told Associated Presscorrespondent Terry Anderson, the longest-held of the 15 foreignhostages in Lebanon. Anderson was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   A letter from teacher Joyce Suger accompanied postcards sent byher students at Windsor High School in Fort Collins, Colo., tohostage Thomas Sutherland.   ``One of the boys said to me, `I know at least one card will getthrough and I know it will be one of ours,''' said her letter. ``Ifhe can believe in miracles, so can I. I hope you'll be back withyour family soon.''   Sutherland, whose hometown is Fort Collins, was acting dean ofagriculture at the American University of Beirut when he waskidnapped June 9, 1985.   Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian ShiiteMoslem organizations.   Irish Ambassador Patrick McCabe said Monday that after meetingwith ``a number of people'' in Beirut he had no hard informationindicating hostages including Brian Keenan of Ireland will bereleased soon. But he declared, ``I have hope.   ``I think it's too early to be less than hopeful,'' McCabe told alate night news conference at his hotel in Brummana, a Christianmountain resort east of the capital.   ``Nothing I have heard puts me in a position to conclude that therumors of an early release of one or more hostages lack anysubstance,'' said McCabe, who added he plans to stay one more weekin Beirut to pursue his efforts.   He declined to identify who he met or where he met them.   McCabe, who is Ireland's ambassador to Iraq and Lebanon, arrivedfrom his base in Baghdad on Saturday in an effort to verify reportsKeenan and possibly British journalist John McCarthy were about tobe freed.   Keenan, 38, of Belfast, an English language teacher at theAmerican University of Beirut, was kidnapped April 11, 1986. He alsoholds British citizenship.   McCarthy, 32, of London, a producer for the London-basedWorldwide Television news agency, was abducted six days later as hedrove to Beirut airport to catch a flight to London.   No group has claimed to be holding either man.   He also said he received ``no hard information'' on AnglicanChurch envoy Terry Waite.   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 after leaving a west Beiruthotel for an appointment with the captors of Anderson andSutherland. No group has claimed responsibility for his abduction.</TEXT></DOC>
