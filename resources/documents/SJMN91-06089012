Flynn and his accomplices testifiedas part of plea-bargain deals that call for minimum prison sentences rangingfrom 18 to 28 years. Smart's attorney plans to appeal her conviction.;   Cecelia Pierce, Smart's student intern at Winnacunnet High School, testifiedthat Smart asked Flynn and his friends not to kill Gregory Smart in front ofthe family dog because she didn't want the animal to be traumatized.;   Pierce said in a recent interview that she has signed a $100,000 contract witha Hollywood film producer. She also said she has received $1,300 for appearingon two syndicated television shows.;    Brian Washburn, who testified that thevictim was his closest friend, said he began getting offers in September fromseveral film and book companies seeking the rights to his story.;    Nextweek, Pierce and William Smart, the victim's father, are scheduled to appeartogether on &quot;Donahue.&quot; William Smart also has expressed interest in a moviedeal, and he and his wife are considering appearances on &quot;Inside Edition&quot; andAustralian television.;    At the trial, the Smarts heard testimony that theyoungster who killed their son had lost his virginity to theirdaughter-in-law, a high school media instructor, at age 15 after Flynn andPamela Smart watched a videotape of the steamy movie &quot;9 1/2 Weeks.&quot;;    Theylearned that Pamela Smart, a fervent admirer of the rock group Van Halen, hadcome to detest what she thought was the yuppie lifestyle of their son, herhusband.
