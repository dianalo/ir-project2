<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-0125 </DOCNO><TEXT>The rate of Cd{sup 2+} sorption by a calcareous aquifer sand was characterizedby two reaction steps, with the first step reaching completion in 24hours. The second step proceeded at a slow and nearly constant rate forat least seven days. The first step includes a fast adsorption reactionwhich is followed by diffusive transport into either a disordered surfacefilm of hydrated calcium carbonate or into pore spaces. After 24 hoursthe rate of Cd{sup 2+} sorption was constant and controlled by the rateof surface coprecipitation, as a solid solution of CdCO{sub 3} in CaCO{sub3} formed in recrystallizing material. Desorption of Cd{sup 2+} fromthe sand was slow. Clean grains of primary minerals, e.g. quartz andaluminosilicates, sorbed much less Cd{sup 2+} than grains which had surfacepatches of secondary minerals, e.g. carbonates, iron and manganese oxides.Calcite grains sorbed the greatest amount of Cd{sup 2+} on a weight-normalizedbasis despite the greater abundance of quartz. A method is illustratedfor determining empirical binding constants for trace metals at in situpH values without introducing the experimental problem of supersaturation.The binding constants are useful for solute transport models which includea computation of aqueous speciation.</TEXT></DOC>
