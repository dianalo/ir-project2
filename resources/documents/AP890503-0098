JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Radioactive releases from a government uraniumprocessing plant in Ohio likely have been two to six times greaterthan estimated, and internal documents reveal a history ofdeceptive recordkeeping and inadequate pollution monitoring, aconsultant reported today.   The findings involve a 1,050-acre Energy Department plant atFernald, Ohio, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, where federalofficials have acknowledged that significant amounts of uraniumparticles over the years have been released into the air.   The government has estimated that as much as 552,000 pounds ofradioactive uranium dust may have escaped into the air from theplant, which has been producing uranium for nuclear weapons use fornearly four decades.   But the report by an engineering consulting firm indicates thereleases could be as great as 3.1 million pounds over 37 years, andin any case was higher than the government's worst-case scenario.   The report was prepared for lawyers pressing the $300 millionlawsuit against National Lead of Ohio Inc., which operated theplant until 1985, on behalf of 14,000 people who live nearby.   The suit, which alleges the plant has created a health hazardand reduced property values, is scheduled to go to trial nextmonth. Chris Sankey, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, saidthe department would have no comment on the consultant's reportbecause of the litigation.   The Institute for Energy and Environmental Research said itbased its higher release estimates on information provided by aformer plant supervisor in a court deposition and a computeranalysis of levels of radioactive contaminants found in soilsamples within five miles of the plant.   ``The official estimates (cited so far by the government) ofcumulative releases of uranium to the air from this plant are basedin part on fabricated data and what plant documents themselvesdescribe as an `inherently deceptive' method of calculating'' someof the releases, said Arjun Makhijani, the author of the study.   Among the findings cited by the report:   _Comments in a court deposition by Michael W. Boback, formerhead of industrial hygiene and radiation at the plant, during abouta dozen years stack filters at some buildings were not examined,but ``zero loss'' entries were, nevertheless, made in releaserecords.   _No adequate accounting was made of radioactive releases fromareas not specifically monitored, although internal documents showsuch releases likely were significant. A spot check on suchreleases during one month shows releaes greater than tabulated forthe plant's entire 37-year history in the government estimates.   _Documents indicating that losses of uranium particles fromstack scrubbers were understated because the estimates were basedon highly efficient scrubbers, while internal plant memos showscrubbers often malfunctioning or in poor condition.   The engineering consultants also used a computer analysis ofsoil samples within five miles of the plant showing average levelsof about eight times what would be expected if releases had beenlimited to the estimates cited by the Energy Department.</TEXT></DOC>
