These are plants which have operated successfullyon an industrial scale for decades with a power plant output of ca. 1,000MW having been implemented in numerous cases. These plants are used bothfor storing electric energy and for other tasks, espec. network control,and allow great loading and load shedding speeds in the order of ca.30 MW/s. Frequent start-ups and shut-downs or changes of operating loads(up to 30 times) are normal in daily operation. Specific cost are plant-dependentand, therefore, hardly compare. Plant cost for new plants may be estimatedto vary between DM 1,000 and DM 3,000 per kW.</TEXT></DOC>
