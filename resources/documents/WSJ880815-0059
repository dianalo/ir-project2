The defense contractor said the workers, members of the United Auto Workers, struck the company's defense systems and aircraft braking systems divisions, which Loral acquired from Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. in March 1987. The striking workers represent 10% of Loral's overall work force.    A spokeswoman said that the previous contract had expired and that talks on the first contract with Loral had broken off. Salaried employees are planning to operate the plant, she said, adding that &quot;Loral is confident it will be able to meet all its customer commitments during the strike.&quot;    In Akron, a union spokesman characterized the walkout as &quot;a company-called strike&quot; brought on by Loral's demands for lower wages and tighter work rules, including mandatory overtime. &quot;It's clear they wanted this strike,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;We would have been happy staying where we were under the old contract, but they wanted all these concessions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
