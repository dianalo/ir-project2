<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0295 </DOCNO><TEXT>A theory for the evolution of behavioral interactions among relativesis developed that allows for genetic correlations between the types ofbehavior that are expressed in different social contexts. Both theoreticaland empirical considerations indicate that such genetic constraints willalmost certainly be common in natural populations. It is shown that whengenetic correlations between elements of social behavior exist, Hamilton'srule inaccurately describes the conditions for evolution by the way ofkin selection. The direction in which social organization evolves isa delicate function of the genetic covariance structure among behaviorsexpressed as an offspring, sibling, parent, etc. A change in this covariancestructure caused by random genetic drift or by a change in environmentfor a population exhibiting genotype-environment interaction can causethe population to suddenly cross a threshold into a new selective domain.Consequently, radical changes in social organization may arise betweenclosely related species without any major shift in selective pressureexternal to the population.</TEXT></DOC>
