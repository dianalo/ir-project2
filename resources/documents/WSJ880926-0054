New Respect --- Nations Turning to Agency to Ease World Tension </HL><AUTHOR> Frederick Kempe (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FORGN </CO><IN> BIO </IN><TEXT>   With persistence and keen timing, United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has helped broker peace agreements where peace had seemed unattainable, in Afghanistan and between Iran and Iraq.    He used these same talents to convince President Reagan to call a cease-fire in the administration's financial war with the U.N. At a private Oval Office meeting on July 15, Mr. Perez de Cuellar gently interrupted the president's reading of a statement on world peace, saying he had come to talk about money.    The Reagan administration had been withholding more than half a billion dollars in dues and other payments to protest the lack of U.S. influence over what it considered profligate spending by the U.N. With many U.S. conservatives convinced that the U.N. was a soapbox for anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, and anti-American troublemakers, withholding funds wasn't politically difficult.    But the budget squeeze threatened the U.N.'s survival at a time of unprecedented diplomatic successes, Mr. Perez de Cuellar told the president. Then, over lunch, U.N. Undersecretary-General Joseph Vernon Reed warned Mr. Reagan that the legacy of his hero, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was the creation of the U.N., while &quot;the legacy of your last 100 days could be the collapse of the house of peace.&quot;    According to a U.N. note-taker, Mr. Reagan replied: &quot;I didn't know the situation was this serious. I'm sympathetic. I'll do the best that we can.&quot;    Two months later, the White House announced the U.S. would make $467 million in overdue payments and meet new obligations next year exceeding $200 million.    Winning over President Reagan, a longtime U.N critic, was another victory for the soft-spoken, aristocratic secretary-general. Under his tutelage, the U.N. has been midwife to more peace agreements than ever before; its policy-making Security Council has been less fractious, and, while other factors also apply, radical Third World nations have softened their rhetoric and started a search for more-practical economic solutions.    As a result, Western nations, which have gained more control over the U.N.'s budget, are turning increasingly to the 159-nation agency to reduce world tensions. Says Mr. Perez de Cuellar, a 68-year-old Peruvian diplomat who took the U.N. helm in 1981, &quot;Now we are delivering. We are finally proving our usefulness.&quot;    Of course, he has been helped by changing global conditions. More than any previous Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev sees the U.N. as a face-saving way to disengage from costly foreign adventures. Economic stagnation has made the Third World more interested in cooperation than confrontation with the West.    And, the more success Mr. Perez de Cuellar has, the more members turn to the U.N. &quot;There has been a general outburst of common sense in areas long immune to it,&quot; says the Ford Foundation's Brian Urquhart. When Mr. Urquhart was a top U.N. official, his attempts to get warring parties together were stymied by lack of confidence in the world body. Today, peacemaking chances are falling into Mr. Perez de Cuellar's lap &quot;like overripe fruit,&quot; he says with a touch of envy.    The U.N. chief is pursuing peace in such unpromising places as Cyprus, Lebanon, Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq border, the Western Sahara, southern Africa and Cambodia. He wins plaudits even from critics of the U.N. &quot;I have enormous respect for what the secretary-general has done,&quot; says Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican, who led the U.S. effort to withhold U.S. contributions. &quot;He's engaged. He's done it in a quiet way, yet he's been able to stick with it.&quot;    Mr. Perez de Cuellar says his most important accomplishment has been to breed more cooperation among the Security Council's five permanent members, the U.S., the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France. In 1986 he asked them to write a resolution to end the Iran-Iraq war. The plan that emerged &quot;addresses all aspects of the Iran-Iraq problem,&quot; he says. Now he wants to use the &quot;tremendous potentiality of the meeting of minds of the five permament members&quot; to tackle more difficult issues, including the most difficult of all, an overall Middle East peace.    The permanent members meet frequently to sip tea and discuss world problems in one of the U.N. living rooms. Some meetings are almost collegial. &quot;This has never before happened in the history of the U.N.,&quot; says the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Herbert Okun. &quot;Iran-Iraq got us into the habit of cooperating.&quot;    Privately, U.N. officials concede that the world body's more-sober approach results partly from Washington's decision to withhold 60% of its contributions until the U.N. reined in its spending. The budgets for 1988 and 1989 show the first declines ever in real, inflation-adjusted terms. The staff is being cut by 13%. Most important, budgets now must be passed by a General Assembly consensus rather than by majority vote, which was easier to achieve.    Washington pays 25% of U.N. dues, an amount determined by its share of the world's economic output; some 80% of the budget is provided by eight countries. Yet the Third World determined how the money was spent, giving rise to decisions such as a plan to build a $73.5 million convention center in Addis Ababa in the midst of Ethiopian famine. Third World nations gave in to U.S. demands for reform when they saw they might lose the goose that laid so many golden eggs.    The U.N.'s financial crisis isn't necessarily over. Washington is strapped itself, and it isn't clear where the U.S. will get the money to pay its arrears. &quot;We shouldn't make too many promises,&quot; says Sen. Kassebaum.    A more potent U.N. also could hurt the U.S., which has trouble forming blocs to support its causes. Richard S. Williamson, assistant U.S. secretary of state for international organization affairs, notes that U.N. members voted with the U.S. only 18.6% of the time last year, a historic low. Egypt, which received $2.5 billion in U.S. aid last year, voted with the U.S. just 14% of the time. Pakistan, which got $671 million, sided with Washington on 12% of the votes.    Meanwhile, the Soviets are taking an increasing interest in the U.N. They have already paid off $200 million in arrears, and are paying their share for peace-keeping forces, which they have often criticized. What is more, they are paying in dollars instead of the rubles that U.N. officials found so difficult to spend.    Last year Mr. Gorbachev called for &quot;a comprehensive system of international security&quot; with the U.N. at its core. He said the U.N. should enhance its role in critical areas, ranging from the environment and medicine to terrorism and disarmament. </TEXT></DOC>
