SRB</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Tommy Thompson asked Wisconsin'sattorney general today to prepare a lawsuit against Chrysler Corp.because of its plans to close its automaking plant in Kenosha,Wis., but left open the possibility of a settlement.   Thompson said it was possible an agreement could be reached withChrysler before the issue actually goes to court.   Asked about the odds of the matter actually ending up in court,Thompson replied, ``I don't want to engage in a percentage'' atthis time.   The governor stressed that, in such matters, it is alwaysdesirable to negotiate before going to court.   ``That would certainly spare the trauma. It would be better offfor both parties to settle'' without going to court, he said.   ``The attorney general has advised me ... that we do have a goodand winnable case,'' said Thompson, who was joined at a newsconference by Attorney General Don Hanaway.   Thompson said it could be some time before the suit is filedover Chrysler's decision to lay off 5,500 workers in Kenosha.   He said he talked Tuesday with Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca andwould meet later with other Chrysler officials. He declined to saywhere or when the meeting would occur.   ``The lawsuit is a type of thing that can be won in severalways,'' Thompson said.   The governor said he has asked Hanaway to check with localgovernment officials in Kenosha and with United Auto Workers unionLocal 72 at the Chrysler plant there to see if they want to join inthe lawsuit.   Thompson repeated his contention that Chrysler's decision toabandon automaking in Kenosha was political and not economic.   He said Omni-Horizon cars were being produced at Kenoshaefficiently and were of the highest quality.   ``There is no reason,'' he said, ``for Chrysler not to live up''to what the state contends was an agreement by the automaker toproduce the cars at the plant for five years.   ``All of us at Chrysler are very sorry that the plant had to beclosed. We also feel very deeply for the pain and suffering'' ofthe workers and community, Chrysler Motors Chairman GeraldGreenwald said at a news conference in Chicago after Thompson'sannouncement.   ``I guess you could say Chrysler was overly optimistic'' when ittold workers and government officials in Wisconsin that it believedit could build the Omni-Horizon small car at Kenosha for up to fiveyears, Greenwald said.   ``But we never lied to anyone and we believe there are nogrounds for a lawsuit claiming we did lie,'' he said.   Greenwald said Chrysler will repay the city and county ofKenosha more than $1 million the governments spent on improvementsfor the plant.   ``My position is the retention of 5,500 jobs for five years,''Thompson said. ``Those jobs don't necessarily have to be automobilejobs. They could be other manufacturing jobs.''   Hanaway said it had not been decided precisely what Wisconsinwould seek in the suit, but he said the state probably would askthe court for an injunction to delay the layoffs.   Thompson, asked if defense contracts for the plant might besomething the state would go after, replied: ``I think that is apossibility.''   In fiscal year 1987, Chrysler Corp. and three subsidiaries _Electrospace Systems Inc., Gulfstream Aerospace and American MotorsCorp. _ were awarded 375 Pentagon contracts worth more than $268million.   In the first two months of fiscal 1988, the contractors won $11million in contracts.</TEXT></DOC>
