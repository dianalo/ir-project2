(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former furniture salesman testifiedtoday that former PTL executives David and James Taggart used a PTLcredit card to pay off a $15,000 debt for furniture that wasdelivered to their New York apartment.   Preston Mitchell, who worked at the Mecklenburg Design Center inCharlotte in 1985, said the Taggarts purchased more than $20,000worth of furniture for their $640,000 one-bedroom apartment in TrumpTower. Mitchell said he went to New York to set up the sofas,tables, custom area rug and chairs.   The Taggarts are charged with evading $487,000 in federal incometaxes from 1984 to 1987.   Mitchell said David Taggart used a credit card issue to PTL topay off the $15,350 balance on the purchase. The credit card receiptintroduced by Justice Department prosecutor David Brown carried ahand-written notation that the furniture was purchased for theHeritage Grand Hotel.   The hotel is on the grounds of Heritage USA, the PTL Christiantheme park south of Charlotte.   Brown also entered documents showing David Taggart had used hispersonal credit card to purchase $6,200 in bedroom furniture for theTaggarts' home in Charlotte.   A handwritten note on that charge slip indicated the canopy bed,mattress and armoire were to be used in the presidential suite atthe Heritage Grand Hotel, the suite used by PTL founder Jim Bakker.   On Wednesday, friends of the Taggarts testified that the two toldfriends their wealth came from a family inheritance.   ``They told me about growing up in Detroit, that they got aninheritance from their grandfather,'' Penny Hollenbeck, who becamefriends with David and James Taggart when they worked together atPTL in the early 1980s, testified for the prosecution Wednesday.   Federal prosecutors say the brothers diverted $1.1 million ofministry funds to their personal use by taking cash advances on PTLcredit cards and using blank ministry checks to pay the credit cardbills. They have argued that the Taggarts lied even to their closestfriends about the source of their wealth to conceal their actions.   Eugene Shelton IV, another former PTL aide and friend of theTaggarts, said he asked David Taggart about his money while the twowere on a trip to Florida in 1985.   ``I believe I was blunt, I came out and asked,'' Shelton said.``He told me he had received a trust fund from family ... I believefrom his parents. It was $6 million _ $3 million each.''   Last week, testimony from the Taggarts' father, Henry Taggart,established that the claims of family wealth recalled by their PTLco-workers were false.   Two women who described themselves as longtime friends of theTaggarts described being taken on expensive trips to California,Florida and London.   Lucinda McLellan and Darlene Peterson said the trips included$3,000 hotel bills, dinners costing $600 each and shopping spreesthat cost several thousand dollars.   In other testimony, a representative from a New York City furshop said the Taggarts spent about $35,000 on mink coats and otherfurs for themselves at her store. And a salesman for a New York shoestore said the Taggarts spent nearly $100,000 from 1982-86 on shoesfor themselves.   Television evangelist Rex Humbard, a former PTL board member,testified that he keeps tight spending controls at his ministry inBoca Raton, Fla.   ``Nobody in our organization is authorized to spend more than$10,000 outside the budget without authorization from the board ofdirectors.''   If convicted on the tax evasion charges, the Taggarts each couldbe sentenced to 25 years in prison and face fines totaling about $1million.</TEXT></DOC>
