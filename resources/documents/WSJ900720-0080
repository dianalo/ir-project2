The &quot;chip set,&quot; called Mipset, could spark a proliferationof inexpensive Unix workstation clones, much as earlier chipsets helped computer makers in the mid-1980s cloneInternational Business Machines Corp.'s personal computersfrom off-the-shelf parts. &quot;It's an important first steptoward lowering the barrier to entering the workstationmarket,&quot; said Michael Slater, editor of MicroprocessorReport, a newsletter.</LP><TEXT>   The new chip set also places LSI Logic in a uniqueposition to tap the booming market for workstations, powerfuldesktop machines used most often by engineers butincreasingly popular for business applications as theirprices fall to compete with personal computers. LSI Logicalready makes a chip set for clones of Sun MicrosystemsInc.'s machines, which, along with Mips-architecturemachines, hold the lion's share of the market forworkstations using reduced-instruction-set computing, orRisc, technology.   The LSI Logic chip set squeezes into five chips thecircuits that normally occupy more than 40 chips inconventional Mips machines. The chip set would allow amanufacturer to build a workstation without spending the timeand money to design it from scratch.   &quot;All they need to do is put a box around it, add a screenand a keyboard, and they're in business,&quot; said KeisukeYawata, president of LSI Logic's Japanese subsidiary, whichdesigned the chip set and manufactures it in Japan.   One of the first users of the chips will be Japan'sBrother Industries Ltd., which is building a laptopworkstation without any prior experience in making computers.Four other Japanese and U.S. companies plan to build thechips into laser printers and computers, Mr. Yawata said.Japanese engineers designed the chip in Japan to help attractbuyers among Japanese electronics companies, which are morecomfortable with chips produced in that country, he said.   LSI Logic said it will begin shipping immediately samplesof its Mipset and will produce mass quantities by the year'send. The chips are available in two versions, a $704 versionoperating at 16 million and a $1,097 set running at 20million instructions per second, LSI Logic said.   The new chip set is also important to Mips, which haslicensed a broad range of companies to make and use its chipsas part of its battle against Sun and others to establish theMips chip as a de facto standard for Unix workstations. Sunis also in the unlikely position of encouraging clones of itsmachines in order to woo computer users into its camp.   LSI Logic gets the best of both worlds as the only bigmaker to produce both Sun and Mips chips under license. &quot;Fromtheir point of view, it's an awfully comfortable position,&quot;said Mr. Slater. Still, he said, the financial success of LSILogic's chip sets depends on its customers' ability to eatinto the personal computer market, which is much larger thanthe Unix workstation market. &quot;They've got to get ontomainstream business desktops; that's where the volume is,&quot; hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
