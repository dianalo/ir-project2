Unlike the binary case,the additional degree of freedom does not permit a unique determinationof Ostwald ripening conditions from equilibrium considerations. *TheLSW theory is extended to include nonideal solution behavior and solidsolubility in a ternary system. Theroetical predictions are comparedwith experimental data and explain the growth rate dependance on composition.</TEXT></DOC>
