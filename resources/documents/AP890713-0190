An aide to Finance Minister Shimon Peres said Israel had indirectcontacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization through U.S.intermediaries.   Peres, who leads the party, said Labor ``has no aspiration tobreak up the government. The Labor Party aims to work for theadvancement of the peace plan. Now the campaign is on continuing thepeace initiative.''   In Jerusalem, a tear gas grenade exploded Thursday night duringthe closing ceremony of the international Maccabiah Games for Jewishathletes.   Thousands of people, including Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamire,attended the ceremony at the Western Wall in Arab east Jerusalem,holiest site of Judaism.   The cloud of acrid smoke set hundreds of people running. Severalwere treated for smoke inhalation.   Police spokesman Uzi Sandouri said the grenade could have beenthrown by Arab nationalists or accidentally dropped by a policeofficer. Israel army radio said several suspects were detained, butdid not elaborate.   Jerusalem police chief Aryeh Bibi said later the grenade was notof the type used by police and was not dropped by a policemen.   In the occupied territories, Israeli soldiers killed aPalestinian on Wednesday night when masked youths attacked an armypatrol in the Gaza Strip with knives and axes, the army said.   The death raised to 560 the number of Palestinians killed in the19-month uprising against Israeli occupation in the West Bank andGaza. Thirty-five Israelis have been slain.   Eight Arabs were reported wounded Thursday.   In London, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe met with BassamAbu Sharif of the PLO and urged the PLO to follow a moderate line,the Foreign Office reported. It said the meeting was the firstbetween a British Cabinet officer and a senior PLO official.   Israel's deputy foreign minister, Benyamin Netanyahu, called themeeting was ``a setback not only for genuine peace in the MiddleEast, but ... for British policy against terrorism.''   Peres spoke after Labor ministers met Wednesday night and decidedto stay in the governing coalition if Shamir reaffirms hiscommitment to the peace initiative.   Labor Party leaders recommended Monday the party quit the Cabinetto protest hard-line conditions for peace talks with thePalestinians. The conditions, including an end to the uprisingbefore peace talks are held, were adopted by Shamir's right-wingLikud bloc July 5.   Labor leaders did not cancel a party vote on the issue set fornext month, but many ministers said a compromise was possible.   The Labor move followed appeals from Secretary of State James A.Baker III and American Jewish leaders for Labor to stay in thegovernment. The State Department denied it sought to intervene, butIsraeli officials confirmed the appeals.   President Bush said Thursday the United States will not changeits Middle East policy. He said Israel should go forward withelections in which the 1.7 million Palestinians of the occupiedlands would elect representatives to negotiate with Israel.   Leading voices within Likud said they wanted Labor to stay andthe peace plan remained intact.   Netanyahu said: ``If they want to leave, it's their business,''but added: ``I don't think it would be proper at this moment.''   Shamir aide Yossi Ahimeir said the prime minister met withPalestinian leaders from the occupied lands about the election plan,and some observers said the meetings were timed to pacify Labor.   ``There have been, there are and there will be meetings withPalestinians from the territories ... but there were no meetingswith PLO people or those linked or close to the PLO,'' Ahimeir said.   Israeli radio reported that PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdel-Rahman saidhis organization has had direct contacts with Israeli officials,including a discussion with a messenger of Defense Minister YitzhakRabin, and that Shamir was aware of it.   Shamir, Peres and Rabin, as well as the Foreign and Justiceministries, denied direct or indirect contacts with the PLO.Shamir's office director, Yossi Ben-Aharon, dismissed such reportsby describing the PLO as ``the embodiment of cheating, lies andobscenity.''   Peres deputy Yossi Beilin said, however, that indirect but``clear, official, unequivocal negotiations have been under way ...via the Americans'' for more than two months.   Israel television said U.S. Ambassador William Brown routinelybriefs Peres and Rabin on the U.S.-PLO talks in Tunisia and the PLOis briefed on Israeli positions.</TEXT></DOC>
