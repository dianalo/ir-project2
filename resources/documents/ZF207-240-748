 And theycan often be vicious, just mucking up your system for the hell of it, ratherthan profit, i.e.andP;  making long-distance calls on your tab.andM;There are many things you can do to stop phone hackers with varying degreesof sophistication and effectiveness, but the experts agree that the firstthing you should do to secure your telephone system and peripherals is usethe security features that are built into your system.andP;  After that, you onlyneed common sense.andM;&quot;Passwords are the real key,&quot; says Ron Hammon of SRX.andP;  &quot;And in our case theywork.&quot;andM;&quot;There is a trade off between ease-of-use and the system's security,&quot; saysLauren Bish, a product test engineer with Applied Voice Technology, amanufacturer of call-processing systems.andP;  He has given a lot of thought tothe security of his company's products.andM;&quot;People want a small password because it's easier to handle, but the longerthe password the harder it is for the hacker to break in.andP;  Once security isenabled, adding one or two more possibilities to the security code will makeit exponentially harder to break in.&quot;andM;Chris Kasper, a security expert with Advanced Telecommunication Corporation,a long-distance carrier, says the same is true for long-distance callingcards.andM;&quot;Raising the number of digits is a pain to the customer, but it helps.andP;  Anycode that is four or five digits long is an easy target to hit.andP;  The moredigits the better.&quot;andP;  He recommends a code with eight or nine digits.andM;Memorex Telex's phone product manager Jim Bie reminds us that common sensecomes into play with passwords too.andP;  &quot;Changing your passwords is a good idea.andO;Don't use your company's name as the password and don't use the installer'sname.&quot;andM;Joseph Budziak of Siemens says another thing to remember is to check withyour service company to make sure they periodically change the password.andO;Normally, they are the only ones who use your system's remote-programmingcapability.andP;  You should make sure that they are not a weak link in yourdefense against hackers.andM;Another precaution he suggests is disconnecting callers from the system afterthey have unsuccessfully tried to enter a password three times.andM;ModemsandM;Modems give the outside world access to your phone system.andP;  Joseph Budziak ofSiemens hates to see modems on direct inward dial (DID) access lines.andO;&quot;Companies should make modem calls go through the attendant position.andP;  Theattendant can then extend the call to the modem.&quot;andP;  If the attendant isunfamiliar with the caller or has a question about their credentials he orshe should take their phone number and call them back to verify that they arewho they say they are.andM;Richard Minthorne of NEC says, &quot;If the phone system is connected to a modemyou should put a switch on the line and manually disconnect the modem -- turnit on and off.&quot;andP;  It's a simple, mechanical way of protecting your phonesystem from hackers.andM;Jim Bie says data security is often overlooked on voice/data PBXs.andP;  &quot;The dataservice in PBXs aren't extensive, but modem pools, for example, give people,who are calling into a modem, access to one mainframe.andP;  You wouldn't wantthem to be able to get elsewhere in the system.&quot;andM;He recommends callback modems to keep unauthorized users out of the system,and internal class of service limits on trunks to keep people who do get inwhere they belong.andM;As far as access through DISA, &quot;that's plain telephone administration,&quot; saysNEC's Minthorne.andM;He offers no shortcuts.andP;  &quot;You have to watch the reports.andP;  Police it.andP;  Monitoryou billing.&quot;andP;  And when you detect abuse you should change the authorizationcodes.andM;Some security breaches are caused by a simple lack of common sense.andM;Lauren Bish heard of one hacker who took advantage of a new receptionist.andO;&quot;The hacker called up and had the receptionist go in and make new mailboxeson the voice-mail system and make him in charge of them.andP;  How the hackerconvinced her to do it I don't know.andM;&quot;It wasn't one of our systems, but it could have happened to anyone'sproduct.andP;  It's just a matter of common sense.&quot;andM;Common sense would also suggest that you shouldn't post your telephone cardnumber on the walls of your offices so everyone -- employees and visitors --can see it, but that's what Chris Kasper has seen in some companies he hasvisited.andM;&quot;I don't think they would do that with their MasterCard or Visa,&quot; he says.andM;If you catch a phone system hacker, it's an opportunity to prevent furtherabuse.andP;  &quot;Pursue the hackers vigorously in a court of law, civil or criminal,&quot;advises Kasper.andM;&quot;Down in Houston they were having a problem with hackers.andP;  They arrested twoof them, even though they knew they didn't have them all, and activitystopped for a few months.andP;  Word gets out when someone is arrested.&quot;andM;If your long-distance company doesn't want to go after the hackers, youshould keep on them until they do, says Kasper.andP;  &quot;Sitting down and talking tothem doesn't seem to have any effect.&quot; But prosecution apparently does.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
