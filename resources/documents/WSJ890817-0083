The idea of the world's largest package-delivery company testing a fuel other than gasoline in some of its 104,000 vehicles pleases environmentalists and regulators fighting deteriorating air quality. But an announcement such as the one UPS made yesterday, telling of the trial before a gaggle of reporters and television cameras at its midtown Manhattan garage, makes the natural-gas industry positively giddy.    For right now, an unofficial race is on to determine which, if any, low-polluting fuels can make inroads on gasoline, America's fuel of choice for nearly a century. And press agents and politicians may have as much to say about the outcome as chemists, engineers and auto makers.    Most of the contenders are well-known, and previous efforts to promote them have flopped. But now, renewed public and political concern about air pollution is giving them another chance -- and this time their sponsors seem determined to take it.    &quot;A trend is developing&quot; toward alternative fuels as the nation scrambles to meet newly proposed air-quality standards, says William Muszynski, a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency. &quot;No one believes we can meet those standards running vehicles as we do now.&quot;    Mr. Muszynski says natural gas could become a factor in the search for a cleaner-burning transportation fuel. Others are pushing alcohol fuels, such as methanol and ethanol, as the fuels of the future; indeed, revised clean-air regulations recently proposed by President Bush prominently mention them.    Then there's reformulated gasoline -- technically not an alternative, but perhaps the front-runner. Major oil companies have for some time been experimenting with new formulas that would cut pollution by changing what goes into the tank in the first place. Atlantic Richfield Co. is noisily promoting on the West Coast a reformulated gasoline for old cars that eliminates lead and, it says, reduces other tailpipe byproducts. Chevron Corp. is also at the forefront of the effort to overhaul gasoline chemistry.    Not surprisingly, a natural gas company is playing a big part in the UPS experiment announced yesterday. Brooklyn Union Gas Co. presented UPS with data showing potential reductions of 25% in nitrogen oxide emissions and 13% in hydrocarbon emissions by switching trucks from gasoline to natural gas. These pollutants contribute to smog and to ground-level ozone that can cause respiratory problems. In addition, the gas company told UPS that emissions of carbon dioxide, which hurts the atmosphere's ozone layer, could be cut by 23%; those of carbon monoxide, by 85%.    UPS was impressed. &quot;The use of clean fuels is going to be mandated, and we want to be ahead of the game,&quot; says Harry Winters, a UPS official. &quot;If we rely solely on gasoline in the future, our company could be jeopardized.&quot; UPS says it was also happy to learn that natural gas costs only 57 cents a gallon, compared with 87 cents for unleaded gasoline. Moreover, Brooklyn Union is right across the street from a UPS site and agreed to refuel the 10 trucks during the test.    Success, however, is far from certain. UPS says it ran vehicles on methanol and tested some multifuel vehicles that would run on various substances a few years back. They were maintenance nightmares, company officials recall, so the maintenance and fuel costs of natural gas vehicles must stay in line with gasoline-powered UPS trucks. If UPS is satisfied, says the company's automotive engineering manager, Don M. Parkinson, it will next try natural gas in other heavily polluted cities, such as Los Angeles, Houston and Chicago.    Though results may be years away, the UPS test has natural gas backers applauding. &quot;You can wrap yourself in the American flag on this one,&quot; says Jeffrey Seisler, executive director of the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition, a utility-sponsored group. Natural gas is abundant in this country, clean and easily used, he says. Currently, about 30,000 vehicles powered by natural gas are in use around the country, he says, but none could do so much for the image of natural gas as the UPS trucks.    Backers of natural gas point to the more than one million miles of pipeline already in place in the U.S. to distribute the fuel, and they claim natural gas pumps could be installed alongside gasoline pumps at gas stations by tapping into existing lines and installing compressors. Several years ago, 80 service stations in Vancouver, Canada, were so equipped for a test, they note.    But others are more cautious. &quot;Convincing people that {natural gas} won't be any additional trouble&quot; could be a problem, says the EPA's Mr. Muszynski. For one thing, even if the investment is made in service stations to pump natural gas, new cars would have to be redesigned to include three three-foot cylinders under the vehicle's body to hold enough compressed gas to prevent frequent refueling. Older ones would have to be retrofitted. Some engine changes would also be needed.    Methanol and ethanol, the alcohol fuels, are regarded by auto makers as more viable alternatives -- but only barely. As far back as 1916, Henry Ford toyed with making fuel from vegetable matter, and auto racers use methanol because it coaxes better performance from engines. Also, both forms of alcohol produce lower levels of hydrocarbons than gasoline, and California studies indicate that they also produce fewer so-called greenhouse-gas emissions.    &quot;Developing methanol cars isn't that far off from a capability standpoint,&quot; says Donald R. Buist, director of Ford's automotive emissions and fuel economy office.    But, he adds, &quot;we'd have to scramble technologically&quot; to get it done by the 1995 target date that the Bush administration set for methanol cars to hit sales targets in nine of the nation's most polluted cities. And cars that can burn either gasoline or methanol could cost &quot;several hundred dollars&quot; more than conventional models, Ford estimates.    Worse, methanol and ethanol are far more corrosive than gasoline, damaging fuel tanks and ruining rubber engine seals more quickly. &quot;Using only methanol or ethanol would require completely changing the fuel system, using all-plastic parts and redesigning the fuel injectors,&quot; says Joseph M. Colucci, head of the fuels and lubricants department at GM Research Laboratories. Then, too, methanol-powered engines are more difficult to start when cold.    The lack of widespread availability at service stations may be the biggest obstacle to all alternatives, however. &quot;When we ran vehicles completely dedicated to methanol, we found people were absolutely paranoid they'd run out of fuel,&quot; Mr. Colucci says. &quot;Drivers simply wanted to see a station they could use at every street corner, like they could with gasoline.&quot;    Which leaves gasoline. Big Three auto makers are backing reformulated gasoline for a simple reason: It requires them to make almost no costly and technologically difficult engineering changes to cars and trucks. That's especially important because the new concern over air pollution seems to be pointing toward separate sets of regulations for various parts of the country, such as California and the Northeast.    Top GM and Ford executives have been urging top oil company officials to pick up more of the clean-air burden now than they did in the 1970s. &quot;Reformulated gasoline could be used in existing vehicles and would more quickly improve air quality compared to the effect of a limited number of vehicles using alternative fuels,&quot; says GM President Robert C. Stempel.    The oil industry, however, remains reluctant to bear the full brunt of any changes. &quot;A combination of better vehicle emission-control systems along with the possibility of reformulated gasoline would be more cost-effective,&quot; says Gene Spitler, Chevron's general manager for product engineering.    Plus, gasoline specialists say the science is at an early stage. &quot;In terms of significant effect on reducing air pollution, we're not quite there yet,&quot; says Mr. Spitler. </TEXT></DOC>
