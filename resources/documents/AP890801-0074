Foley cautioned todayagainst permitting the Middle East hostage crisis to strain U.S.relations with Israel, saying ``no greater goal could be sought bysome of the terrorists.''   Foley's comment came as Israel's kidnapping of a radical Moslemcleric drew direct fire from Congress and indirect criticism fromPresident Bush after the apparent execution of American hostage Lt.Col. William Higgins in retaliation.   The White House told congressional leaders at a briefing lateMonday that the United States was kept in the dark about Israel'splans to kidnap Abdul Karim Obeid on Friday from his home south ofBeirut.   ``There was no consultation between Israel and the UnitedStates,'' said one lawmaker who attended the White House briefing,speaking on condition of anonymity. ``That was mentioned two orthree times.''   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas pressed ahead todaywith his criticism of the Israeli government for its ``unilateral''decision to kidnap Obeid.   ``Today I am not happy that one of our closest and mostimportant allies, Israel, has also struck out alone, free-lancing,apparently in the interest of gaining leverage to win the releaseof some of its citizens held hostage,'' Dole said in a speech onthe Senate floor.   But he added that he did not blame Israel for directly causingHiggins' apparent death, saying instead that ``his blood is on thehands of the assassins.''   ``It was an action taken with an inappropriate bravado andpublic show which tended to exacerbate the situation,'' Rep. RomanoMazzoli, D-Ky., said of the Israeli seizure of Obeid.   ``In the future ... I hope the Israelis act with the samerestraint and concern for all likely consequences, including theeffect upon the lives of all hostages, which is being exhibitedtoday by President Bush,'' Mazzoli added.   In his daily news conference, Foley said Higgins had been killedby terrorists and added, ``The United States and Israel have bothbeen victimized by terrorist acts.''   ``No greater goal could be sought by some of the terrorists thanto drive a wedge between the United States and Israel,'' he said.   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, speaking on ABC's ``GoodMorning America'' program, said risks are inherent in battlingterrorism, and ``the United States knows that well.''   ``I understand the anguish and the feeling of frustration in theUnited States... But I think that it is important that we reserveour anger against those who are responsible for this situation,against the terrorists of the Hezbollah movement.''   The Senate voted 99-0 late Monday to condemn the apparentHiggins killing in a resolution that also took a swipe at Israel.   The resolution called on Bush to urgently consult Israel andother governments ``concerning their policies and actions whichmight have relevance to the interests of the United States orincrease the vulnerability of U.S. citizens to attacks byterrorists.''   Dole said the resolution was a signal to terrorists and theirsponsors in nations like Iran, but also was meant ``to send amessage to our friends.''   The message: ``This is a very serious matter and we believe thatin any future efforts there should be some notification, somecoordination, and maybe more responsibility assumed by ourfriends,'' he said.   Earlier, Dole sounded bitter as he noted on the Senate floorthat Israel had to know before it undertook the kidnapping of Obeidthat the action would place American hostages in further jeopardy.   Participants in the White House meeting said Dole made the samepoints directly to Bush, and also noted that he had been criticizedby some lawmakers for his comments.   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on ``CBS ThisMorning'' that the Israeli action ``was not helpful, and it's not afocused response.'' Higgins was a onetime military aide toWeinberger.   ``I think that was a most unfortunate statement at thatparticular time,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said on the CBSprogram of Dole's remarks. ``And I think that our alliance withIsrael is very important at this point.''   ``To suggest that ... the execution of Colonel Higgins shouldfall in the lap of the Israelis is a complete overstatement andfrankly plays into the hands of the terrorist organizations whowould like to create deeper divisions ...between our own nation andthat of Israel,'' Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said on the sameprogram.   Bush, in a statement Monday night, said, ``On Friday, I saidthat the taking of any hostage was not helpful to the Middle Eastpeace process. The brutal and tragic events of today haveunderscored the validity of that statement.''   Israel supporters in Congress quickly defended the kidnapping.``Their operation is a logical act in the context of the chaos inwhich it was carried out,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.   Dole's criticism was ``a contemptible slander, and it shows morethan anything the gullibility of its utterer,'' he said. ``It isprecisely what the murderers want people to think. But ... there isonly one party responsible for the murder of Colonel Higgins, andthat is his Shiite Moslem captors.''   Others in Congress issued calls for U.S. revenge and one, Rep.Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., circulated a letter calling on colleagues tosupport an effort to extradite Obeid to stand trial for terrorismin the United States.   But others cautioned against moves that would worsen thesituation.   ``Like all Americans, I want to see strong and forceful actionagainst the people who may have killed Col. Higgins,'' said HouseMajority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``But our actions must notbe motivated by mere revenge. They must be designed to identify andbring to justice those responsible for this heinous act.''   House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,urged that the matter be brought before the United Nations SecurityCouncil. Higgins was working as a member of the U.N. peacekeepingforce in Lebanon when he was abducted more than a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
