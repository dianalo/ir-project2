Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG><T3>FAC 84-37, Items I thru XV. </T3>The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub.L. 96-511) does not apply because these final rules do not impose any reportingor recordkeeping requirements or collection of information from offerors,contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of OMBunder 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG><T3>FAC 84-37, Items I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, XIII, and XIV. </T3>TheRegulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) does not apply because eachrevision is not a ``significant revision'' as defined in FAR 1.501-1; i.e.,it does not alter the substantive meaning of any coverage in the FAR havinga significant cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors,or a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of theissuing agencies. Accordingly, and consistent with section 1212 of Pub.L. 98-525 and section 302 of Pub. L. 98-577 pertaining to publication ofproposed regulations (as implemented in FAR Subpart 1.5, Agency and PublicParticipation), solicitation of agency and public views on the revisionsis not required. Since such solicitation is not required, the RegulatoryFlexibility Act does not apply.<T3>FAC 84-37, Item IX. </T3>The revisions to FAR 15.804-6 and SF 1411will neither expand existing Government rights of access to informationnor will these revisions eliminate existing protections for proprietarycommercial pricing data. The revisions, in limiting the right of examinationto information necessary to adequately evaluate the proposed price, clarifyexisting policy and do not constitute significant revisions. The DoD, GSA,and NASA certify that this final rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 602, et seq.)<T3>FAC 84-37, Item X. </T3>As noted in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice of October 28, 1986, the Councils haddetermined that the proposed rule would not have a significant effect beyondthe internal operating procedures of procuring agencies or a significantcost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors. Consequently,section 22 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act did not requirepublicizing the proposed rule for public comment. Because publicizing wasnot required, the Regulatory Flexibility Act did not apply to the proposal.Nevertheless, the Councils solicited public comments to facilitate maximumparticipation in fashioning sound procurement regulations. None of thecomments received questioned the underlying assumption concerning impactand effect. Moreover, none of the revisions incorporated in the final ruleappears to alter the rule's impact or effect on contractors or offerors.Accordingly, the Councils have not prepared a final regulatory flexibilityanalysis for the final rule.<T3>FAC 84-37, Item XI. </T3>This final rule change to FAR 19.501(k) willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) becauseit implements a statutory requirement which does not place limitationsupon subcontracting (section 921(c) of the Small Business Act.<T3>FAC 84-37, Item XII. </T3>The change to FAR 31.204 will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities underthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) because the newrule is merely guidance for application of the cost principles and hasno economic impact on large or small business.<T3>FAC 84-37, Item XV. </T3>This final rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) because use of city boundaries,rather than just commercial zones designated by the Interstate CommerceCommission, is both more equitable for bidders and more in accord withcommercial practice. No comments were received from small entities in responseto the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Public Comments</ITAG><T3>FAC 84-37, Item II. </T3>A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 28, 1986 (51 FR 39456). The commentsthat were received as a result of the proposed rule were considered bythe Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition RegulatoryCouncil in the development of this final rule.<T3>FAC 84-37, Item VIII. </T3>A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 15, 1986 (51 FR 36777). The commentsthat were received as a result of the proposed rule were considered bythe Councils in the development of this final rule.<T3>FAC 84-37, Item IX. </T3>A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23396). The commentsthat were received as a result of the proposed rule were considered bythe Councils in the development of this final rule.<T3>FAC 84-37, Item X. </T3>A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 28, 1986 (51 FR 39456). As a resultof the comments received, as well as the passage of Pub. L. 99-661, theCouncils have further revised FAR Subpart 17.2 and Part 52 and are issuingthe complete revisions as a final rule.<T3>FAC 84-37, Item XII. </T3>A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 30, 1987 (52 FR 15884). The DefenseAcquisition Regulatory Council and the Civilian Agency Acquisition Councilconsidered the public comments received and concluded that there is a needto develop language in FAR 31.204, Applications of principles and procedures,to provide guidelines for determining the status of costs to which morethan one cost principle is relevant and to minimize the number of interpretationsof the prevailing rules. This final rule language clarifies the proposedrule coverage and describes the process for determining the relevant costprinciples to apply.This final rule language stresses two points. In instances where a costcan be subdivided, it must be apportioned among the selected cost principlesin 31.205. In instances where such an apportionment cannot be accomplished,the cost principle which most specifically deals with or best capturesthe essential nature of the cost at issue governs. This final rule languageemphasizes the need to associate costs, or elements of a cost, with theappropriate cost principles.<ITAG tagnum="85">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19,31, 38, 39, 42, 47, 52, and 53</ITAG>Government procurement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 12, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Harry S.
