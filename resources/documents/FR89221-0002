These regulations are designedto prevent the introduction into the United States of rinderpest, foot-and-mouthdisease, African swine fever, hog cholera, swine vesicular disease, andviscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease.We published in the <T4> Federal Register</T4> on September 14, 1987 (52 FR 34677-34682, DocketNumber 85-080), a proposal to amend the regulations in several ways. Weproposed to change language concerning ``entry'' into the United States.The term ``importation'' under the animal quarantine laws means to bringwithin the territorial limits of the United States. The term ``entry''means to introduce into the commerce of the United States after releasefrom government detention. In certain instances in 9 CFR Part 94, terminologyprohibiting ``entry'' is used where terminology prohibiting ``importation''is intended. We therefore proposed to uniformly change language in theregulations prohibiting <T3>entry</T3> into the United States of certain animals, meat, and animalproducts to language prohibiting <T3>importation</T3> of these articles. We also proposed to change theterm ``port of entry'' to ``port of arrival'' wherever it appears in Part94; to require that meat certificates be presented to the authorized inspectorof the United States Department of Agriculture (the Department) at theport of arrival upon arrival of the meat or meat products in the UnitedStates; and to require that certificates, issued by an authorized officialof the national government of the country of origin and stating that themeats have been prepared according to the conditions for cooking or curingspecified in andSection; 94.4, accompany cured and cooked meats into theUnited States from countries where rinderpest or foot-and-mouth diseaseexists and be presented to an authorized inspector at the port of arrival.Our proposal invited the submission of written comments, which were requiredto be postmarked or received on or before November 13, 1987. We receivedthree comments. One supported the proposed rule with no changes. The second,submitted by a commercial meat importer, supported the proposed rule, butrequested that we specify that we will accept either copies or originalsof the required certificates. We recognize that commercial importers arerequired to submit originals of the certificates to the Department's FoodSafety and Inspection Service (FSIS). It has therefore been our policyto accept copies of the certificates. Because we will continue this policy,there is no need to change the proposed rule based on this comment.The third commenter, an industry association, expressed concern over aproposal to amend 9 CFR Parts 327 and 381 to move sites for inspectionsof imported commercial meats from inland customs ports to centralized centersat all-water ports of arrival or other designated ports. The commenterapparently confused our proposed rule with proposed regulations publishedby FSIS, which carries out inspection of commercial importations of meats.For this reason, we are making no changes based on this comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous</ITAG>Since we published our proposed rule on September 14, 1987, certain ofthe amendments we proposed on that date have been made final rules in otherpublications. In a document published on August 18, 1987, in the <T4> Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 30901-30902, Docket 87-089), we amendedthe introductory paragraph in andSection; 94.8 by removing the Netherlandsfrom the list of countries where African swine fever exists or is believedto exist. In a final rule published on September 8, 1987, in the <T4> Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 33800-33801, Docket Number 86-129), weadded the definitions in andSection; 94.0; revised the heading in andSection;94.1; and redesignated paragraph (b)(3) in andSection; 94.4 as (b)(4), andadded a new paragraph (b)(3). In another document published on June 14,1988 in the <T4> Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 22128-22129, Docket Number 87-187), weredesignated the footnotes in Part 94. Further, in another document publishedon December 1, 1988, in the <T4> Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 48519-48520), we deleted the definitionof ``Deputy Administrator;'' added the definitions of ``Administrator,''``Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service'' and ``Department,'' andchanged certain terminology in 9 CFR Part 94. This final rule reflectsthese amendments made since the September 14, 1987, proposal. In addition,we have made nonsubstantive changes for the purpose of clarity.Based on the rationale set forth in the proposal, and with the changesexplained above, we are adopting the proposed rule as a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.The majority of this rule is concerned with clarifying where certain, currentlyrequired, certificates must be presented to U.S. officials upon arrivalof certain animal products in the United States, specifying that thesecertificates must be presented at the port of arrival, rather than at theport of entry. With two exceptions, this rule will not alter the presentprovisions governing which products require certification when shippedto the United States.The change that presentation of the certificates be made at the port ofarrival will have no economic impact, other than that of facilitating impositionof penalties on violators of the regulations. The Department anticipatesthat total additional penalties collected annually because of the changeswill amount to less than $4,000.The change that will affect certification will establish provisions torequire certification for importation of cooked or cured meats from countrieswhere rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists. The economic impactof obtaining certification will be minimal, and the products affected willrepresent significantly less than 1 percent of all such animal productsentering the U.S. economy.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The regulations in this rule contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507<T3>et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.
