The systems notice for thissystem was most recently published at 53 FR 52792; December 29, 1988. Datain this system are used primarily for statistical and research purposesrelated to evaluating the operation and effectiveness of the Medicare program.A principal subfile in the system is the Medicare Provider Analysis andReview (MEDPAR) File. The MEDPAR File contains data from hospital billsof Medicare beneficiaries discharged from hospitals participating in theMedicare program, including data on beneficiary demographics, medical diagnosisand surgery, and utilization of hospital resources. HCFA developed theQuality and Effectiveness of Care MEDPAR (QC/MEDPAR) File from the MEDPARFile to increase the amount of data available for quality and effectivenessof care research and development and application of improved measures fordetermining the quality and effectiveness of care furnished in hospitalsparticipating in the Medicare program. To this end, HCFA prepared and publisheda new routine use permitting the release of the QC/MEDPAR File for qualifiedresearch. This routine use was published May 3, 1988 in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and became effective June 2, 1988. Since publicationof the QC/MEDPAR routine use, HCFA has received suggestions from the healthcare industry that use of the data should be broadened to include releasesfor evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of care in hospitals. Manyresearch projects also include an evaluation of care component, but manyworthwhile evaluations of care projects could not be considered research.Evaluations may include or be limited to monitoring and feedback on a continuingbasis. QC/MEDPAR data will be available for such monitoring and feedbackunder the proposed modifications for approved projects. Research and evaluationof health care must be encouraged because of the expected improvement inthe quality and effectiveness of care that would result from applicationof the process itself apart from new findings.HCFA is committed to the improvement of the quality of health care of Medicarebeneficiaries and the general public. We believe that making the QC/MEDPARFile available for quality and effectiveness of health care evaluations,as well as research, will assist in this effort and is compatible withthe purpose for which the data in the File were collected. Disclosure ofdata such as that in the QC/MEDPAR File can be made under a routine useonly when justified by a substantial public interest (<T3>Andrews </T3>v. <T3>Veterans Administration of the United States, </T3>613 F. Supp. 1404,(D.C. Wyo. 1985)). We believe that the criteria and conditions under whichdisclosure of the QC/MEDPAR File for research or evaluation would be madeprovide assurance that substantial public interest will be involved witheach disclosure.Research and evaluation plans submitted under section c.(1) of the routineuse (as modified) for the QC/MEDPAR File should be in sufficient detailto permit HCFA to make a determination that the purposes cited in the planare likely to be accomplished and that the public interest would be servedin a substantial way. This does not require, however, the development andsubmission of a detailed work plan with a discussion of all of the technicalcomponents. This requirement can be met by a statement of the goals ofthe project; methods for achieving those goals, principal investigators;overview of analyses to be undertaken; and any other relevant componentsof the project such as feedback of information to providers (if applicable).HCFA usually will require that a recipient of the File submit a copy ofits plans for publication of any data (or aggregation of data) from theFile prior to publication. A copy of each proposed statistical table shallbe submitted, but HCFA will not need to see each completed table with allof the numbers in place. The purpose of requiring review before publicationis to determine whether or not a beneficiary's identity could be deducedfrom detailed information in the proposed table and sensitive informationrevealed. For example, publication of information by individual zip codecould be a problem since there are many zip codes in which there is onlyone Medicare beneficiary. Usually, examination of publication plans withtable shells will permit a determination of whether or not beneficiaryprivacy would be at risk. In other cases, a statement of the data elementsin the File that would be deleted would be sufficient to determine thatthe proposed publication would pose no risk to beneficiary privacy. We are proposing that the routine use for the QC/MEDPAR File (routine usenumber (7) in the system notice for the Medicare Bill File (Statistics),System No. 09-70-0005), be modified to read as follows: (7) With respect to the QC/MEDPAR File, to entities with a legitimate needfor data for the purpose of conducting research or evaluation on the qualityand effectiveness of care provided in hospitals. Research or evaluationunder this routine use must focus on the improvement of health care ormeasures for determining, validating, and monitoring the quality and effectivenessof hospital care in such areas as access to care, outcomes of care, andeffectiveness of care in improving, restoring, or maintaining the independenceand functioning of Medicare beneficiaries. Information disclosed underthis routine use will be limited to the data elements described in AppendixA. The QC/MEDPAR File may be released to an entity in HCFA determines: a. That the use or disclosure does not violate legal limitations underwhich the data were provided, collected, or obtained. b. That the purpose for which the disclosure is to be made: (1) Cannot reasonably be accomplished unless the data are provided in thedetailed form described in Appendix A: (2) Is reasonably likely to be accomplished in view of the capabilitiesof the requesting entity and other factors; and (3) Is of sufficient importance to warrant the possible effect on the privacyof the individual that the disclosure of the data might bring. c. In order for HCFA to determine that the requirements in section (b)are met, the entity must submit and HCFA must approve: (1) A research or evaluation plan specifying the objectives of the researchor evaluation, the manner in which the data will be used, the financialsupport for the plan, and the date the research or evaluation will be completed.Evaluation plans designed to assist specific providers must be supportedby letters of commitment to the evaluation by the providers. Values ordifferences in values that would trigger provider action must be addressedin the evaluation plan as well as the action the provider intends to take;and (2) A copy of any report by a panel of recognized experts reviewing theresearch or evaluation plan (when such review has been performed). (d) The entity and its contractors, if any, must sign a statement acknowledgingthat section 1106(a) of the Social Security Act, which prohibits the disclosureof confidential information and imposes criminal penalties, may apply.They must also agree to the following: (1) Not to link the data to other beneficiary-specific records nor to usethe data to identify individual beneficiaries; (2) Not to use the data for purposes that are not related to HCFA-approvedresearch or evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of hospital inpatientcare. Prohibited uses include but are not limited to: marketing (for example,identification and targeting of under or over-served health service marketsprimarily for the purposes of commercial benefit), insurance (for example,redlining areas deemed to offer bad health insurance or underwriting risks),and adverse selection (for example, identifying patients with high-riskdiagnoses). The data must not be made available by the entity or its contractorfor an activity not approved by HCFA, even if carried on within the entityor its contractor;(3) Not to disclose the data to any persons or organizations unless thedata are in aggregated form as described in paragraph 5. The data may bedisclosed to a contractor for data processing if:(a) The entity has specified in the research plan submitted to HCFA thatthe contractor would receive the data for that purpose, or the entity hasobtained written authorization from HCFA to make the disclosure to thecontractor, and(b) The contractor has signed a confidentiality statement with HFA:(4) Not to publish or otherwise disclose the data in a form raising unacceptablepossibilities that beneficiaries could be identified (i.e., the data mustnot be beneficiary-specific and must be aggregated to a level where nodata cells have ten or fewer beneficiaries);(5) To submit a copy of its plans for any aggregation of the data intendedfor publication to HCFA for approval prior to publication;(6) To establish appropriate administrative, technical, procedural andphysical safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the data and to preventunauthorized access to it;(7) To return all files to HCFA, and destroy any copies that may have beenmade, at the completion of the research or evaluation plan.This modification of the routine use for the QC/MEDPAR File is consistentwith the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7), since, as previously noted,it is compatible with the purpose for which the information is collected.Because this modification of the routine use will not change the purposesfor which the information is to be used or otherwise significantly alterthe system, we are not preparing a report of altered system of recordsunder 5 U.S.C. 552a(o).
