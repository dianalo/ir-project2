(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker, banished to prison forfleecing his PTL followers out of millions of dollars, was ``ingood spirits'' Wednesday as he got adjusted to life behind bars, aprison spokesman said.   ``He's settling in,'' said Brian Ross, a spokesman at theTalladega Federal Correctional Institution. ``He's doing fine.''   Two former Bakker aides known for their fashionable suits andbaby crocodile shoes reported to another Alabama federal prison tobegin serving more than 17 years for tax evasion.   Bakker, head bowed and bound hand and foot, arrived at theTalladega prison in eastern Alabama late Tuesday under the glare oftelevision lights after a six-hour drive from Charlotte, N.C.,where he was sentenced.   The founder of PTL had no comment for reporters as guardshustled him from a brown sedan to the entrance of the rural,medium-security lockup. Two 15-foot fences topped with razor wiresurround the facility.   Earlier Tuesday in Charlotte, U.S. District Judge Robert Pottersentenced Bakker to 45 years in prison and fined him $500,000 fordefrauding thousands of followers of his television ministry. Hewas ordered to begin serving the long sentence immediately.   Bakker was issued an orange jumpsuit and assigned to a two-mancell with bunk beds, a desk, lavoratory and toilet. Prisonofficials would not reveal his cellmate's identity, other than tosay he was ``another lightweight security inmate.''   Bakker made some telephone calls Wednesday morning and exercisedin an outside yard, Ross said. He would not disclose if Bakker hadspoken with his wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, or other family members.   ``Basically, he's familiarizing himself with unit operations andthe institution's rules and regulations,'' Ross said in a telephoneinterview. ``He's being supervised in an open-type setting.''   Mrs. Bakker and her 13-year-old son did not travel to Charlottefor Bakker's sentencing Tuesday. They were staying with friends inthe Orlando area and she did not make herself available toreporters.   The Bakker's new television ministry in Orlando has beensuspended, but the storefront church they have been running in anOrlando shopping mall remains open and is expected to hold Sundayservices with Mrs. Bakker and guest ministers.   Ross said he met with Bakker Wednesday morning to relay numerousmedia requests for interviews, which Bakker referred to hisattorney in North Carolina.   The spokesman said no additional security measures were plannedduring Bakker's stay at the prison, which often is a first stop forfederal prisoners in the Southeast. He is expected to be at thefacility for no more than two weeks before he is transferred toanother federal prison, which officials would not identify.   Bakker, who was placed in a unit with about 375 other prisonersawaiting assignment, would have to serve at least 10 years inprison before he is eligible for parole unless a planned appeal issuccessful.   Ross said Bakker's family and attorneys can visit the defrockedTV evangelist on three evenings during the week and all day onweekends. Bakker also will be able to attend religious services onSundays.   In Montgomery, David Taggart and his brother, James, arrived bycab at the minimum-security prison at Maxwell Air Force Base about10:39 a.m. Wednesday, Warden Wayne Seifert said.   David Taggart was Bakker's personal assistant at PTL, handlinghis travel arrangements and schedules and serving as the bank forthe PTL entourage whenever Bakker traveled. James Taggart was PTL'sinterior designer.   The Detroit natives, who started as piano players with theministry, were convicted of evading more than $500,000 in incometaxes. Prosecutors said they diverted more than $1 million inministry funds for personal uses, including expensive wardrobes,jewelry and a Manhattan apartment.   David Taggart was sentenced to 18 years, five months in prisonand his brother received 17 years, nine months.   Seifert said they were assigned to a dormitory in which 40inmates sleep on bunk beds in an open room.   Dismissing descriptions of the minimum-security prison as acountry club, Seifert said, ``We have two 18-hole golf courses oneither side, though the only access our inmates have to the golfcourses is to cut the grass.''</TEXT></DOC>
