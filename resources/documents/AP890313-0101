But they agree the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Servicedecision to detain undocumented immigrants in southern Texas, ratherthan allow them to leave that area during asylum appeals, has notstopped the flow of aliens joining friends and relatives in Miami'sHispanic community.   ``The crackdown has slowed it down slightly, but they're stillcoming,'' said Robert Fannin, district superintendent of the Miamidistrict of United Methodist Churches.   Officials of the Nicaraguan American Foundation, which helpsrefugees with immigration paperwork, say that since the Feb. 21 INScrackdown they have received only 96 requests from people whoidentified themselves as Nicaraguans.   ``It's less than half of what it was before,'' said foundationPresident Maritza Herrera.   Immigration officials say it's hard to know how many are arrivingunnoticed.   ``I can't scientifically quantify the amount, because many havegone underground,'' said district INS director Perry Rivkind.   Some city officials have estimated that a total of 100,000Nicaraguans could enter the Miami area through next fall.   Those who do arrive continue to find a community that acceptsthem with open arms. Although government agencies are limited, thecity's churches still make room for them.   Refugees showing up at the Shenandoah Presbyterian Church inLittle Havana are fed, clothed and housed, even though the church isfeeling the burden.   ``We're stretched to the limit,'' said church official MorrisMaxwell. ``But we have no choice.''   The church's pastor, the Rev. William Iverson, said many refugeesarrive hungry, homeless and ill. ``When you see it firsthand, it'snot easy to turn your back,'' he said.   All agree housing is the toughest problem to solve.   After the city moved 300 Nicaraguans out of the downtown BobbyMaduro Miami Stadium earlier this year, most of them wound up ontheir feet, but about 20 families without work permits are in dangerof eviction from their apartments.   ``We're checking into it,'' said City Manager Cesar Odio. ``Ifthey're going to be thrown out, we have to do something about it.''   Odio said he hoped to find an additional $4,000 from privategroups that have previously sponsored Nicaraguans here.</TEXT></DOC>
