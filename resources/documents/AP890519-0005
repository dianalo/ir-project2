DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Pentagon costs most congressionaldistricts more in taxes than they get back through militaryspending but the situation likely will change in the 1990s becauseof changing budget priorities, says an economist who studies theeffects of federal spending.   ``These numbers should look quite different five or six yearsfrom now,'' James R. Anderson said Thursday in releasing a studythat showed 321 of the 435 congressional districts lost money onthe deal.   ``The patterns are fairly stable over a long period of time, butI think we are going to see some very significant changes as we gointo the '90's, in part because of base closings but also in partas we level off and perhaps significantly reduce the militarybudget,'' said Anderson, a professor of economics at Michigan StateUniersity.   Anderson, a senior fellow of Employment Research Associates ofLansing, Mich., an independent, non-profit economic consulting firmthat conducted the study, said the findings run counter toarguments often heard on Capitol Hill.   ``For years, members of Congress would say that even if theywanted to, they couldn't vote against military spending because itmeant money coming into their districts,'' Anderson said. ``But wefound that the Pentagon budget isn't a boon to most congressionaldistricts, it's a drain.''   The study was based on fiscal year 1987, during which U.S.military outlays came to $282 billion. An additional $7.1 billionwas spent on military categories of foreign aid.   For the study, that $289.1 billion was apportioned among thestates and then divided among congressional districts by a formuladesigned to take into account income levels as well as population.   The North Central region of the country was the biggest loser,with 97 of its 113 districts in the net loss category. In theNortheast, there were 80 net loss districts and 15 gainers. TheSouth had 99 net loss districts and 43 that gained. The West wasthe closest with 45 districts losing and 40 districts, heavilyconcentrated in Southern California, gaining.   The district with the biggest net gain from military spending,more than $3 billion, was the 10th District of Virginia, home ofthe Pentagon. The biggest net loss, $1.2 billion, was in the 7thDistrict of Texas, in Houston.   Anderson said he included prime contracts, military salaries andwages and retirement pay but not veterans' payments in calculatingdefense expenditures and in his formula estimated that about 40percent of federal taxes go for federal expenditures. He said thisis higher than some other estimates, which run between 26 and 28percent, because he did not include trust funds dedicated to aspecific project in his total.   The study said 104 districts registered a net loss of $500million or more.   Of these, 19 districts were in New York, 13 in Illinois, 11 inTexas, eight each in Ohio and Michigan, seven each in Florida andNew Jersey, five in California, four in Pennsylvania, three each inMissouri, North Carolina and Wisconsin, two in Massachusetts andone each in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas,Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia.   States registering an overall net gain were Alabama, $6.2million; Alaska, $310.1 million; Arizona, $1 billion; California,$2 billion; Colorado, $737.4 million; Connecticut, $115.5 million;Georgia, $299 million; Hawaii, $1.3 billion; Maine $71.9 million.

The most dramatic change was in Texas, which went from a netgain in a previous study in 1981 to a loss of $5.26 billion.   Other losing states were Arkansas, $612.8 million; Delaware,$459.9 million; Florida, $3 billion; Idaho, $220.7 million;Illinois, $11.62 billion; Indiana, $2.82 billion; Iowa, $2.19billion; Kansas, $671.2 million; Kentucky, $1.25 billion;Louisiana, $1.57 billion; Michigan, $8.33 billion; Minnesota, $2.26billion.
