Despite high inflation rates, Latin American cities remain themost financially attractive to expatriates, according to thetwice-yearly study by Business International, a Geneva-basedresearch and consulting company. It said Ecuador's capital, Quito,was the least expensive city.   Taking New York as the base of 100 and using the dollar exchangerate of April 3, the study said Tehran had a cost-of-living index of209, followed by Tokyo at 202 and the Japanese cities of Osaka andKobe at 200.   The strength of the Central African franc and heavy import taxesput six West African cities in the top 10 most expensive worldwidelocationsa, it said. Gabon's capital, Libreville, rated 166.   No. 8 Oslo, Norway, continued to be the costliest European cityfor expatriates paying in dollars, with an index of 142.   Moscow rose 14 points from December 1988 to 111, making it moreexpensive than Paris, 110, or London, 109.   Five of the six cheapest cities in the world are in LatinAmerica, the report said. Quito had an index of only 34, andCaracas, Venezuela, and the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo were ratedat 42.   Brazil had an inflation rate of 1,200 percent in the 12 months toApril 1989, but the impact on expatriates was offset by devaluationof the cruzado against the dollar, according to the study.
