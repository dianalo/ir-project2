This is a pre-requisite for determiningsteam/water to sodium leak rates. Experiments conducted over the temperaturerange 388 - 530 {sup 0}C show that the response of the nickel permeationmembrane is non-linear, even at hundreds of volume parts per millionH{sub 2} in Ar. Good correlation between experimental results and permeationtheory (based on Ficks laws) was obtained, after correcting where necessaryfor the non-linear katharometer response. These thermal conductivitydetectors tend to read lower than absolute above about 0.5% H{sub 2}in Ar.</TEXT></DOC>
