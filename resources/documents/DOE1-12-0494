One of these mutants,strain ADU-15, showed the highest alcohol oxidase activity in glucose-containingmedium. The growth characteristics and also the induction and degradationof alcohol oxidase were compared with the parent strain and mutant strainADU-15. In the parent strain, initiation of alcohol oxidase synthesiswas delayed by the addition of 0.5% glucose to the methanol medium, whereasit was not delayed in mutant strain ADU-15. This showed that alcoholoxidase underwent repression by glucose. On the other hand, degradationof alcohol oxidase after transfer of the cells from methanol to glucosemedium (catabolite inactivation) was observed to proceed at similar ratesin parent and mutant strains. The results of immunochemical titrationexperiments suggests that catabolite inactivation of alcohol oxidaseis coupled with a quantitative change in the enzyme. Mutant strain ADU-15was proved to be a catabolite repression-insensitive mutant and to producealcohol oxidase in the presence of glucose. However, it was not an overproducerof alcohol oxidase and, in both the parent and mutant strains, alcoholoxidase was completely repressed by ethanol.</TEXT></DOC>
