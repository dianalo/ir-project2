Moscow-based correspondents were invited to this militaryfacility set among birch forests and lakes 530 miles north of theSoviet capital to observe back-to-back launches of a Soviet Molniyatelevision satellite and an East Bloc research probe designed toreveal secrets of the ionosphere.   The officially sanctioned trip to the spaceport in northwesternRussia _ whose existence was acknowledged by the Soviets only fiveyears ago _ was further proof of the increased candor in Sovietsociety as well as the space establishment's pursuit of foreignclients and funds.   ``This is a time of openness and we have to make everythingknown that was hidden before, like how space has been mastered, andwhat scientific results are being obtained,'' said Army Lt. Gen.Ivan I. Oleinik, the space center's commander. Also, he said, ``Weneed to learn how to count money.''   To help their space program yield bigger commercial dividends,the Soviets are hunting for foreign partners in space. In April,the first commercial payload was launched at Plesetsk for theFrench firm Matra. Last month, a West German consortium'sexperiment to grow protein crystals in orbit was launched.   The growing commercialization and resulting welcome givenforeigners at Plesetsk is something new in the history of the base,founded in 1957 as a top-secret launch site for Soviet militarymissiles that would be relatively near U.S. targets on the otherside of the North Pole.   Behind the electrified barbed wire fences and armed guards 186miles south of the White Sea port of Archangelsk lies what East andWest agree is the world's busiest space center.   In his respected annual report on the Soviet space program,Nicolas Johnson of Teledyne Brown Engineering said that by 1987,the number of launches into space from Plesetsk had reached 1,159 _more than all total U.S., European, Japanese and Chinese spacelaunches combined.   Oleinik, interviewed on the launch pad minutes before blast-offof the four-stage Soyuz booster rocket carrying the Molniya, putthe number of launches at Plesetsk at ``1,000 and some-odd.''   ``This is the world's hardest-working spaceport,'' the generaladded.   Under the Kremlin's openness policy, stunning revelations havebeen made about failures in the Soviet space program, including the1960 explosion of an ICBM that killed the head of Soviet missileforces, Field Marshal Mitrofan Nedelin, and 53 others at the famousSoviet space center Baikonur, home of the country's manned spaceprogram.   Soviet space specialists, however, say there has been no publicmention of accidents at Plesetsk. But a 30-foot-high rocket-shapedaluminum monument in the base's bedroom community of Mirny honorsthe victims of two apparently previously unreported disasters.   On March 18, 1980, a Vostok rocket _ the same two-stage boosterused to send Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit in 1961 _exploded while being fueled on the launch pad. Forty-five people,mostly Soviet Army inductees in their late teens and early 20s,were instantly burned to death, said Anatoly Lapshin, seniorscientific collaborator in Plesetsk's commercial department.   Five other men, who suffered burns over as much as 90 percent oftheir bodies, died after being hospitalized, Lapshin said.   The 45 killed instantly were buried under red granite tombstonesnext to the monument near the shore of Lake Plesetsk, and theirenameled portraits were affixed on two low concrete walls. In frontof a row of fir trees, an eternal flame burns in memory of ``theheroes.''   Despite 4{ years of the Kremlin's official openness policy,nothing yet has been written by state media about one of thebiggest tragedies and its victims, Lapshin said.   The 1980 explosion was not the only catastrophe at Plesetsk,Lapshin said. On June 23, 1973, a Cosmos booster rocket alsoerupted in flames while being fueled, and nine technicians andsoldiers were killed.   Lapshin said that following the accidents, governmentcommissions met and enacted safer guidelines for the refueling ofrockets.   Oveikin said the accidents were ``tragedies,'' but that humanloss in the pursuit of progress was unavoidable.   ``When the first automobile was tested, there were accidentstoo,'' the two-star general said.   The Molniya satellite, designed to rebroadcast programs fromstate Soviet television and provide radio-telephone service toSiberia and the Soviet Far East, shot skyward with an ear-splittingroar atop the Soyuz booster.   Nine minutes after launch, the 47-yard-high rocket powered byliquid oxygen and kerosene was reported in orbit to journalistswatching from a site nearly two miles from the launch pad.   Before dawn Thursday, technicians at Plesetsk were scheduled tolaunch Intercosmos-24, an East Bloc research satellite.   The spacecraft will carry a metal coil that will expand into aring 20 yards in diameter once the satellite reaches its ellipticalorbit up to 1,500 miles above Earth's surface.   The ring will be powered by low-frequency radio waves and willbecome an antenna stimulating the ionosphere much the way the sundoes.</TEXT></DOC>
