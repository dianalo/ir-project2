We are proposing to amendandSection; 91.14 by adding Olympia, Washington, to the list of ports designatedas ports of embarkation and by adding the Port Olympia Facility as theexport inspection facility for that port. With certain exceptions, allanimals exported are required to be exported through ports designated asports of embarkation.To receive approval as a port of embarkation, a port must have export inspectionfacilities available for inspecting, holding, feeding and watering animalsprior to exportation in order to ensure that the animals meet certain requirementsspecified in the regulations. The regulations provide that approval ofeach export inspection facility shall be based on compliance with specifiedstandards in andSection; 91.14(c) concerning materials, size, inspectionimplements, cleaning and disinfection, feed and water, access, testingand treatment, location, disposal of animal wastes, lighting, and officeand rest room facilities.The agency believes that the Port of Olympia Animal Export Facility meetsthe requirements of andSection; 91.14(c). The facility is located at 915Washington Street NE., Olympia, Washington 98507-0827. Therefore, we proposeto add Olympia, Washington, to the list of ports designated as ports ofembarkation. Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act.We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291.There would be minimal economic effect because there are only about 6 oceanshipments a year out of the Northwest United States. This proposal wouldonly affect owners exporting animals through the port of Seattle, Washington,or the port at Portland, Oregon, by giving these exporters another portfrom which to ship their animals.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This proposed rule contains no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
