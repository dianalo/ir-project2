North repeatedly lied to governmentofficials ``to cover his tracks'' when confronted with complaintsthat Iran was overcharged for U.S. weapons during arms-for-hostagedeals, prosecutors say.   ``North persisted in a pattern of deception that enabled him toexploit the Iran initiative by secretly using it to generate a poolof funds over which he exercised control without governmentalaccountability,'' prosecutors said in a filing Friday.   The former National Security Council aide initially lied to aDefense Department officer and two CIA officials about the priceIranian arms dealer Manuchar Ghorbanifar agreed on for 1,000 TOWmissiles in January 1986, the filing said.   North made the ``critical misrepresentation'' during his reportof the London meeting _ at which Ghorbanifar agreed to pay $10million, or $10,000 a missile.   He told three officials that the Iranian had agreed to pay $6,000apiece for a total of only $6 million, independent counsel LawrenceE. Walsh said in the filing.   North pressed the CIA to reduce the $6,000 price even further andeventually it was set at $3,700 per missile ``for reasons unrelatedto North's statements,'' Walsh said.   The arms deals continued that year but by the summer of 1986``fissures began to develop in North's scheme'' when Iranianslearned they were being overcharged as much as 600 percent. Thediscovery was apparently made when they obtained an accuratemicrofiche price list for Hawk missile parts, Walsh said.   North told CIA officer Charles Allen ``to tell the Iranians thatthe price they had paid was correct and that it was higher than themicrofiche because it was difficult to locate Hawk spare parts,''Walsh said.   He later tried to persuade the CIA to produce a fake price list``to extinguish the complaints.''   Confronted by Allen with Ghorbanifar's complaints that he wasbeing unfairly blamed for the overcharges, North questioned ``thetrustworthiness of Ghorbanifar.''   ``North repeatedly failed to disclose the true origin of theinflated prices _ his own efforts to generate a surplus for theContras. Instead, he attempted to cover his tracks and blame theproblem on Ghorbanifar,'' Walsh said.   In the memo filed with U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell,Walsh said he ``will demonstrate at trial that North played asignificant role in directing expenditures from the enterprisethrough witnesses such as Willard Zucker,'' an American lawyer whooperates a Swiss financial company.   According to the filing, Allen is also prepared to testify thatNorth impugned the trustworthiness of Roy Furmark when told that theCanadian businessman had ``conveyed Ghorbanifar's suspicion thatfunds had been diverted to Central America.''   Walsh also disclosed that North arranged to purchase ``asubstantial quantity of weapons'' for the Nicaraguan rebels, knownas Contras, with money left over from the aborted sale of Hawkmissiles by Israel to Iran in November 1985.   By this time, North and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord, a co-defendant in the case, had already started to set up aclandestine arms-supply network for the Contras, an effort thatWalsh says amounted to a ``secret war'' in Nicaragua.   Walsh's filing indicated prosecutors have evidence thatcontradicts North's congressional testimony last year that thediversion was suggested by Ghorbanifar during their Jan. 22, 1986,meeting.   In the fall of 1985, North directed Israel to place $1 million ina Swiss bank account to cover the expenses Secord would incur byselling the 80 Hawk missiles to Iran via Israel. The deal fellthrough after the first shipment of 18 Hawks because Iran wasdissatisfied with the weapons it received.   ``Much less than the full $1 million... was necessary to coverSecord's expenses,'' Walsh said. ``Aided by this infusion, inDecember 1985, the enterprise shipped a substantial quantity ofweapons to the Contras.''   North and Secord are charged along with former national securityadviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim withdiverting more than $14 million in profits from a series ofU.S.-Iran arms deals in 1986 to the help arm the Contras.   Gesell has said he hopes to bring North's case to trial by lateJanuary at the earliest.   Secord, Poindexter and Hakim are to be tried separately afterNorth.</TEXT></DOC>
