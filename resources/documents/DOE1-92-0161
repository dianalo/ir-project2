A comprehensive checklistof Ostracoda from southeast Asia is concerned with the area between 25{sup0}N and 11{sup 0}S latitude and 140{sup 0}E and 85{sup 0}E longitude.The area includes the western edge of Micronesia, but a brief perusalof the checklist revealed no listing of specimens from Micronesia. Asmall collection of Enewetak ostracods in the suborder Myodocopina atthe National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, containsmembers of all five families that comprise the suborder. Although thespecies in the collection are capable of swimming, and do so occasionally,they spend most of their existence crawling on, or burrowing in, thesubstrate. An exception to this is members of the mainly pelagic genusCypridina, which is represented in the collection by two species. Someof the Enewetak specimens are illustrated.</TEXT></DOC>
