The move may lead to another scaling back of the American forcenow operating in the waterway.   Capt. Will C. Rogers III, skipper of the Vincennes, said thatdespite its many capabilities _ including what U.S. officers callthe most powerful surveillance radar system afloat _ his ship didnot represent an escalation of the U.S. armed presence in thewar-torn waterway.   ``Let's face it. It's a low level threat,'' Rogers said,referring to Iran. ``We don't consider the Iranians an enemy. We'renot at war with them.''   While Rogers described his ship's main role in the gulf asanti-aircraft surveillance, several officers and crew members saidthey were mystified as to why their ship was deployed here and bythe haste in which the assignment was ordered.   The Vincennes had just one day's notice and spent only 90 hoursin port preparations before making a 32-day, 13,00-mile dash acrossthe Pacific from San Diego, Calif., to the Gulf of Oman, where itarrived May 22.   After arriving in ``Goo'' _ as U.S. sailors call the Gulf ofOman _ the Vincennes did not enter the Persian Gulf immediately, asexpected by some of its officers and crew.   The vessel entered the gulf only on Saturday. Some officers saidthe delay apparently occurred because senior U.S. officials did notwant the powerful warship to sail through the Strait of Hormuz, thegateway to the gulf, while Iran was conducting several days ofnaval maneuvers in the area.   The 9,400-ton Vincennes, one of ten ships of its type now incommission, sailed into the gulf overnight. With its crew of 385positioned at battle stations, the ship threaded the so-called``Silkworm Envelope'' in the narrow strait, where Iran has deployedmobile batteries of Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles alongthe coast.   The ship passed a Panamanian-flagged tanker still on fire afteran Iranian attack 20 hours earlier. Salvage tugs sprayed water onit as the Vincennes sailed past about four miles away. The attackwas the second on a neutral tanker in the last two days and thefourth since May 18.   According to Rogers, the Vincennes is the replacement for theguided missile cruiser Wainwright and will take over theanti-aircraft surveillance role performed since February by thatship, one of five leaving the gulf in the next few days.   But with five other ships, including the destroyer John Hancockand four guided missile frigates entering the waterway, the overallstrength of the Navy's gulf-based squadron, known as the MiddleEast Force, will increase by a net of one, to 17.   Although he described his ship as making ``essentially aone-for-one'' switch with the Wainwright, it will bring to thewar-torn gulf a ``multi-mission capability'' equivalent to severalU.S. warships now on duty there, Rogers said.   ``Aegis'' is a state of-the-art, computerized radar surveillanceand missile weapons system that is designed to enable the ship tomanage a battle situation in defense of an aircraft carrier battlegroup.   ``Putting this ship with its radar into the gulf will put a lotof battle management on the scene. Maybe we will be able to reducethe force level in the gulf and back away from the recenttensions,'' Rogers told members of a Pentagon news media pooleaboard the Vincennes.   He said the gas turbine-powered ship burned a million gallons offuel on the trip as it sailed at 23 mph on the 32-day voyage.   Crew members said the cruiser monitored the naval maneuversalong the Iran coast from about 15 miiles away. They said theycould see aircraft and one large warship, which was tentativelyidentified as one of the two World War II-vintage, U.S.-builtdestroyers in Iran's navy.   Tensions in the gulf have run high since U.S. and Iranian navalforces engaged in a serious clash on April 18.   Iran lost a total of six craft sunk or disabled in the April 18battle with the U.S. Navy, including two if its four best frigates.One of those has since been seen operating in the Hormuz Strait.   At least one of the American-built destroyers was known to beoperational, although it had not been reported in action since lastyear when it fired a missile at an aircraft, apparently Iraqi.</TEXT></DOC>
