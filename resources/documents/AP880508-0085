Czeslaw Kiszczak, who also is a ranking Communist PartyPolitburo member, twice telephoned a lawyer acting as a mediator torevive the talks after they broke down late in the afternoon,strike committee members said.   The conversations between Kiszczak and lawyer WladyslawSila-Nowicki, a former member of the outlawed Solidarity tradeunion who has since agreed to serve on Polish leader Gen. WojciechJaruzelski's consultative citizens' council, led to the resumptionSunday night, they said.   The talks resumed at 9 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT), three hours afterSolidarity leader Lech Walesa and about 1,000 other workers defieda management ultimatum to leave the shipyard or face prosecution.   As a result of the talks, the strike committee wrote a letter tomanagement in which it agreed to end the strike and postpone itslong-term goal of reinstating Solidarity under the followingconditions:   _ Guarantee of safe passage from the shipyard for strikers andthe people who have assisted them   _ Promises of no disciplinary action against strikers, includingfines, dismissals or prosecutions. And formation of a jointcommittee from members of the strike committee and the shipyardworkers' council to oversee implementation of the agreement.   _ A wage increase of $38 on the average monthly wage of the lastthree months, about $105.   According to strike committee chairman Alojzy Szablewski andother committee members, an agreement was near.   The remaining sticking points were the creation of the jointcommittee, objected to by management, and whether the rank and filestrikers were willing to give up demands for Solidarity, they said.It was not known whether the two sides planned to push for anagreement through the night, or try again Monday.   The number of strikers was only about half the 800-1,000reported inside the yard Friday, according to Western reportersthere Sunday.   Although a settlement appeared within reach, strikers insidesaid they still feared a police action against the strike.   Thousands of worshipers packed a church in this Baltic port cityin a show of support for the strikers.   In Krakow, Poland's Roman Catholic primate Cardinal Jozef Glempspoke out for the right of all people to participate in society'sdecisions.   All was quiet at the shipyard late Sunday after the deadline inthe management ultimum passed at 6 p.m. (noon EDT).   Piotr Konopka, an aide to Walesa, said the negotiations Sundayafternoon lasted only one hour and management's hard line stood insharp contrast to talks Saturday that the union considered ``a bigstep forward.''   ``The prosecutor and manager listed an ultimatum, saying all wholeave before six are safe and will not be prosecuted,'' Konopkasaid, speaking to reporters at St. Brygida's Church near theshipyard.   The Lenin shipyard strike began Monday and came during a periodof labor upheaval that has been the worst in Poland since the 1981military crackdown.   The strikers have also demanded higher pay, anmesty for theworkers occupying the shipyard and the reinstatement of unionactivists fired by the plant.   Riot police blockaded the shipyard on Thursday and have notallowed any food in since Friday.   A predawn raid by riot police crushed a 10-day strike bysteelworkers in Nowa Huta in southern Poland on Thursday, and someshipyard workers said they feared a similar action.   Glemp said in his sermon that the church can ``point out theroad toward specific solutions. But it is necessary to rememberthat every man has the right to participate in decisionsconcernings the society in which he lives.''   His sermon followed a statement Saturday by Polish-born PopeJohn Paul II that strikes can be justified and Poland lacked ``truedemocracy.''   About 5,000 strike supporters crammed inside St. Brygida'sChurch to pray for those in the Lenin shipyard, the 1980 birthplaceof Solidarity. About 2,000 more flooded the streets nearby andthousands of police stood guard around the church.   ``Disgrace Disgrace'' the crowd chanted when the Rev. HenrykJankowski, Walesa's friend and adviser, delivered his sermon.   ``Why should we support the striking workers?'' Jankowski askedthe crowd rhetorically. ``Because they are fighting for our rights.... The shipyard is the symbol of all of Poland.''   His speech was interrupted with chants of ``Lech Walesa! LechWalesa!'' and ``There is no freedom without Solidarity!''   On Saturday night Walesa told the strikers that if a raid came,``I'll be the last to leave the shipyard.''   The shipyard strike was the latest of five strikes in Poland.   In each case, workers have pressed for higher wages tocounteract inflation which reached 42 percent in the first threemonths of 1988.   The government has said the strikes could derail Poland'sattempts to reform its ailing economy by raising prices, reducinggoverment subsidies, introducing competition and encouragingprivate and managerial enterprise.   One of Jaruzelski's closest advisers, Lt. Col. Wieslaw Gornicki,said Sunday that the strikes were a normal outgrowth of ``makingour economy more efficient.   ``This always, and everywhere, brings about some tribulations,''he said, interviewed from Poland on ABC's ``This Week with DavidBrinkley.''</TEXT></DOC>
