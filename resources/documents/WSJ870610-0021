The computer record was disclosed yesterday in congressional testimony by Fawn Hall, the former secretary to fired NSC aide Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North. Col. North prepared the proposal in the spring of last year.    A single copy of what now appears to be an earlier version of the memo was located last November among Col. North's papers. The new evidence, however, raises questions about where the paper copy of the later draft went and who in the White House saw it.    President Reagan repeatedly has denied any knowledge of the diversion of arms-sale proceeds. But Ms. Hall testified that former National Security Adviser John Poindexter was familiar with the document when it was being prepared in the NSC offices. Under questioning yesterday, she said Adm. Poindexter had read and recommended no substantive changes in the document, which took the form of a memo seeking Mr. Reagan's approval. But the memo wasn't addressed to anyone.    No record has been found to indicate that Mr. Reagan ever saw the memo or approved the diversion of funds.    The difference between the two drafts is minor; for investigators, the discovery is significant because it shows there was a later draft. The draft copy found among Col. North's papers included a handwritten notation to correct the date given for an early shipment of U.S. weapons to Tehran by Israel in 1985. The second version incorporates this change and appears to have been typed into the computer by Ms. Hall.    Congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair only recently became aware of the second draft. The House deputy chief counsel, Neil Eggleston, said the document was &quot;never provided and was apparently in no one's files as a hard (paper) copy.&quot;    The discovery of the later draft came during a search of a magnetic &quot;floppy disk&quot; used to store information from Ms. Hall's computer. Investigators said the same computer records disclosed a list of foreign bank accounts known to Col. North as well as evidence regarding plans to buy arms with funds raised by conservative Carl &quot;Spitz&quot; Channell.    Testifying for a second day before the combined House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair, Ms. Hall portrayed Col. North as a man who always worked closely with his superiors in the NSC and acted with their approval. &quot;I don't believe that he would do anything without authorization,&quot; she said. The 27-year-old secretary, testifying under a grant of immunity from prosecution, told the lawmakers that vouchers compensating the colonel for his extensive travel at home and abroad were approved by superiors.    House Government Operations Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D., Texas) was pointed in questioning Ms. Hall on the vouchers. The issue is expected to receive increased attention because of prior testimony indicating Col. North's trips were linked to fund raising for the Contras and the secret arms supply network he helped to oversee from the White House.    Yesterday's session marked the end of the first phase of the Iran-Contra hearings, which are scheduled to resume in 12 days.    In a strongly worded statement, Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), chairman of the House investigating panel, sought to summarize the findings of the past six weeks. &quot;Privatization of foreign policy is a prescription for confusion and failure,&quot; Mr. Hamilton said of the private network used by the Reagan administration in both the Iran and Contra operations. &quot;The use of private parties to carry out the high purposes of government makes us the subject of puzzlement and ridicule.&quot;    Ms. Hall sat silently through the chairman's comments. But in exchanges with individual lawmakers, the part-time model was combative, even snappish. &quot;Sometimes you have to go above the written law,&quot; she testified.    Later, backing away from this claim, Ms. Hall was defensive about her role in destroying and altering classified documents on behalf of Col. North. &quot;I don't use the word cover-up,&quot; she told House Intelligence Committee Chairman Louis Stokes (D., Ohio). &quot;I use the word protect.&quot;    Often vague in her recollection of events, Ms. Hall seemed to waver between identifying herself as &quot;purely a typist&quot; and later part of the NSC &quot;team&quot; with a personal commitment to the success of the Iran and Nicaragua policies.    &quot;I was protecting the initiative,&quot; she testified, regarding her decision to conceal classified documents under her clothing and smuggle them out of the White House complex hours after Col. North was fired last November. &quot;It wasn't the KGB that was coming, Ms. Hall,&quot; said Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.). &quot;It was the FBI.&quot;    Ms. Hall, fiercely proud of her skills, insisted that she hadn't erred in typing the number for a secret Swiss account intended to receive a $10 million contribution last year from the Sultan of Brunei for the Contras; Col. North used the same account in the Iran-Contra operation. In the process of relaying the account number to a Brunei representative in London, an error was made on the U.S. side, and the money was deposited in the wrong account.    The full $10 million plus interest has since been located in Switzerland, in an account controlled by a 60-year-old businessman involved in shipping, according to Swiss authorities. The businessman is described as prominent in Geneva, but the committees have yet to be given his full identity.    Until the matter is resolved, investigators aren't assuming that only error was involved. Earlier testimony has indicated that at least $3 million of the funds was expected to be diverted for military aid, rather than used for the &quot;humanitarian&quot; purposes first designated by Brunei and the State Department. </TEXT></DOC>
