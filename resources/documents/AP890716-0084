A Norwegian research vessel reported that smoke was coming fromthe sub's observation tower about 5 p.m. and that a Soviet tugboathad been dispatched to help the vessel, said a Norwegian DefenseMinistry spokesman, Erik Senstad.   Other Soviet naval vessels were in the area, in internationalwaters 75 miles off Norway's coast, and the submarine did not appearto be in serious danger, the Norwegian Supreme Command said.   The Command did not say whether it believed any sailors had beeninjured.   The Norwegian state television station NRK showed the submarinesailing under its own power and reported no outward signs of anaccident.   Soviet rescue officials said the submarine was only engaged in anexercise and that the ship had never been in trouble, according toNRK.   However, Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg said ata news conference: ``We have heard nothing official to indicate thatthis was an exercise. And exercise or not, it would have made senseto warn us.''   The Soviet Foreign Ministry responded to a Norwegian request forinformation by saying there had been no problems on Sunday aboardany Soviet submarines off Norway, said Foreign Ministry spokesmanOeyind Nordsletten.   It was the third time in less than four months that a Sovietnuclear-powered submarine has been involved in an incident offNorway's coast.   Norwegian authorities said that as in the previous cases, theSoviets did not alert them Sunday.   Norwegian officials said nothing about whether they believed thesubmarine's nuclear reactors were damaged or whether the shipcarried nuclear weapons.   The submarine was identified as an Alfa-class submarine, which ispowered by two nuclear reactors and capable of carryingnuclear-tipped torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles.   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Soviet Embassy wascontacted to find out if there was any danger of radiation.   The ship was spotted in the Barents Sea about 75 miles east ofthe Norwegian town of Vardoe and north of the Kola Peninsula. Theship was in international waters, 30 miles north of Sovietterritorial waters.   Senstad said it was ``regrettable'' the Soviets had not issued awarning to Norwegian authorities. ``I hope this is the last timesomething like this happens without us being warned,'' he said in atelevision interview.   The Norwegian government said last week it was drafting a treatythat would require the Soviet Union to inform Norway of militaryaccidents. The Soviets have similar agreements with the UnitedStates, Britain, West Germany and France.   Stoltenberg summoned the Soviet ambassador for a meeting lateSunday, the national NTB news agency reported.   On June 26, a fire broke out aboard a Soviet Echo II class vesselthat was sailing 70 miles off Norway's coast in the Norwegian Sea.   Norwegian scientists later said small amounts of radiation leakedfrom the sub and that its reactor may have come close to a meltdown.   The Soviet news agency Tass first said four sailors from that subwere hospitalized and were being examined for possible radiationpoisoning. But the news agency later said the four ``were healthyand have no excess radiation.''   Another accident involving a Soviet sub occurred April 7 when aMIKE class nuclear sub sank in the Norwegian Sea, killing 42 Sovietsailors.   The accidents led to criticism within the Soviet Union about thecondition of the nation's submarine fleet and the training of itsofficers.   Ilya B. Kolton, a 30-year veteran aboard Soviet subs, blamed theApril and June accidents on ``construction deficiencies, imperfectcrew rescue equipment, plus the startling slowness and inertia ofthe naval agencies in introducing new ideas.'' His remarks appearedin the Communist Party youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.   The Supreme Command said the ship involved Sunday was anAlfa-class sub, which has two reactors cooled by liquid metal.   Five such ships are known to be assigned to the Northern Fleet.They usually are armed with torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles ofthe type SS-N-15, the command said.   ``Both types of weapons can carry nuclear warheads. In the West,this 2,900-ton type of sub is considered to be very fast and canmove at great depths. It is assumed that the hull is made oftitanium,'' the command said.</TEXT></DOC>
