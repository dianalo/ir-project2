(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A ``puff'' of tritium escaped from theDepartment of Energy's Savannah River Plant today, but posed nohazard to the public, officials said.   Spokesman Jim Felder said about 20,000 curies of tritium, aradioactive isotope of hydrogen, were released at 6:18 a.m. thismorning during routine operations.   Felder characterized the release as ``a puff'' and said itlasted less than a minute.   The weapons production facility at the plant makes material usedin the production of nuclear weapons, and Felder said details onthe process under way when the release occurred are classified.   The exposure at the plant boundary, about six miles from the HChemical Separations Area where the release occurred, was about0.04 millirems, Felder said. By comparison, he said a normal chestX-ray is 20 millirems.   Two employees in the work area at the time of the release wereundergoing tests to see if they suffered any ill effects. They werewearing full protective gear at the time, he said.   All plant operations have returned to normal, he said.   Felder said an initial assessment of the cause of the releaseindicates equipmment malfunction. However, an investigation will beconducted.   The last such release at the plant occurred July 31, 1987, whena dosage of .2 millirems was measured at the plant's boundary.   The plant's reactors were reduced to half power last year amidconcerns over the cooling system, and Department of Energyofficials told a U.S. Senate subcommittee in Washington on Mondaythat the reactors could be running at full capacity by 1990.   Felder said this morning the process in which the tritium wasreleased is separate from that involving the reactors and would notaffect the reactor plans.</TEXT></DOC>
