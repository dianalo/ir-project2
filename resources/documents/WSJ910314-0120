You don't lie, cheat, steal or hurt otherpeople. You treat people fairly and always do the best youcan. If you, or the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co., wouldlike to drop into my Sunday-school class and talk to mykindergarteners and first-graders, I'm sure they could makeit clear to you what behavior is permissible and what is not.   Peter Hall   Kenmore, N.Y.   ---   Your editorial complains of the Supreme Court's refusal tooverturn more than 200 years of American jurisprudence,itself founded on centuries of English common law, onpunitive damages and the &quot;costly failure&quot; of the trial courts(meaning juries) in awarding punitive damages. While you arecontinually lecturing the judiciary on its activisttendencies, it is somewhat ironic that you now criticize theSupreme Court for not being extremely activist. If there hasbeen a problem created by punitive damages in the generaladministration of justice -- which has not been demonstrated-- let Congress and state legislatures fix it under theprinciples of federalism and states' rights that youconstantly espouse.   As to any complaints about the propriety of punitivedamages in individual cases, while there surely have beencases where eyebrows may be raised, nevertheless, as anyplaintiff's or defendant's trial lawyer will tell you, a jury-- composed of 12 individuals -- is a far smarter animal thanany trial or appellate judge when it comes to assessingliability and assigning fault for offensive conduct,regardless of the flowery oratory of &quot;contingency-feeplaintiffs' lawyers.&quot;   David A. Dopsovic   Washington   ---   I'm amazed by your sense of &quot;justice.&quot; Editorially, youfavor allowing juries to impose the death penalty upon fellowhumans convicted of crimes. How is it possible that you canoppose the authority of juries to impose a mere monetarypenalty upon financial institutions for violation of law,even if such monetary penalty might amount to a &quot;financialdeath penalty&quot;?   It is outrageous that you waste ink on defense ofmiscreant corporations facing huge, but merely monetary,penalties for wrongdoing, while using more ink to supportkilling people convicted of crime.
