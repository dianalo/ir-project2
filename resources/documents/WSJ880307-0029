Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX MON BON ECO </IN><TEXT>   Remember only a few months ago when investors trembled at the prospect of the U.S. dollar again slipping precipitously? Common wisdom was that a plunging dollar -- caused, say, by another unexpected worsening of the nation's trade deficit -- would clobber both stocks and bonds.    Today, in their frenzy to identify the next lucrative takeover target and after two months of apparent narrowing in the trade deficit, few equity investors or analysts seem to be giving the currently stable dollar much thought.    One of the few who is thinking about it is Charles Taylor, the British-born vice president for international economics in Prudential-Bache Securities' Washington office. And he isn't thinking happy thoughts.    In two recent reports to Prudential-Bache clients, Mr. Taylor asserted the U.S. is vulnerable to a currency crisis. &quot;The worst is yet to come,&quot; he concluded.    &quot;The basic problem is that as long as domestic demand remains strong in the U.S., there is a good chance that we will have a disappointing trade number&quot; sooner or later, he said. That, in turn, could cause real trouble for the dollar. &quot;The slightest whiff of a setback to the trade adjustment process contains the potential for a severe shock to the currency.&quot;    That shock would soon hit the stock market. The falling dollar would almost certainly force the Federal Reserve Board to defend the dollar, he says, probably by clamping down on money supply growth and driving up interest rates. Investors who now are so eagerly chasing takeover rumors probably would bail out of the stock market completely, inducing another steep downturn.    If U.S. investors are too short-sighted to appreciate the potential problems, Mr. Taylor said, foreign investors certainly aren't.    &quot;There's been a split in world-wide investor sentiment, with domestic investors forgetting about the dollar but foreign investors continuing to worry,&quot; said Mr. Taylor. He pointed out that the two camps are interpreting the same economic data differently.    &quot;To the domestic investor the cup is half full. He sees domestic and export demand in the U.S. strong and is looking for well-balanced growth,&quot; he said. &quot;To foreign investors the cup looks half empty because they see a continuing demand for imports.&quot;    Mr. Taylor also believes a currency crisis would hurt the U.S. and world economies more today than previously.    The last bad currency crunch in the U.S. occurred between 1978 and 1980. In the earlier period the U.S. was a net creditor; today it is a net debtor, heavily dependent on foreign investment. Today's trade deficit is three times larger than it was in 1978-80, as measured against the gross national product. And with the U.S. now absorbing 22% of the exports of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development countries, up from 14% in 1978-80, the world economy is more vulnerable to U.S. business cycles than it was before, he argues.    Mr. Taylor fumes most about the government's apparent lack of resolve to deal with the underlying problem. &quot;American fiscal policy is an oxymoron,&quot; he said, citing the feeble results of the government's efforts last year to reduce the nation's budget deficit. &quot;Certainly, on the policy front, the adjustments to date lack much credibility.&quot; He points out that Britain's sterling crisis of 1975 and 1976 ended only after the British government adopted budget cuts and tax increases.    However, he gives Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan a tentative vote of confidence. &quot;Greenspan is talking good sense, but we don't know and won't know until there is a crisis whether he has the toughness, the resolve and the control of the board that he would need&quot; in one, he said.    Mr. Taylor doesn't see the potential for a currency crisis dissolving any time soon. &quot;It will take several months to establish a trend that is strong enough to convince people that the deficit is coming down fast enough&quot; and thus that they shouldn't react to any temporary setback, he said. &quot;It isn't enough for trade volumes to improve, they have to improve quickly.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices eased despite continuing talk about takeovers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 5.63 points at 2057.86. That was down 13.76 from the post-crash high of 2071.62 set last Monday. New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 201.4 million shares, compared with 203.3 million Thursday, and declining issues led advancers, 811-696.    American Standard gained 3 7/8 to 72 1/2 after Black andamp; Decker sweetened its bid to $73 a share from $68 a share. Black andamp; Decker said its offer was conditioned on having its nominees elected to American Standard's board or having American Standard negotiate a merger agreement at the new price.    Black andamp; Decker fell 7/8 to 18 1/2. Koppers, considering a bid of $45 a share from a group led by Beazer PLC and Shearson Lehman Hutton, rose 1 3/8 to 53 1/8.    Federated Department Stores gained 3/4 to 67 1/4 as Campeau and R.H. Macy continued to battle for the company.    Among active stocks American Cyanamid lost 1 to 52 1/4 as takeover speculation eased. And Long Island Lighting gained 1 3/4 to 10 after asking New York State's Long Island Power Authority and Urban Development Corp. to make its &quot;best offer&quot; for a takeover of Lilco.    Xerox was among the Big Board's big losers. It lost 2 to 59. The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column expressed some skepticism about rumors that had boosted Xerox share prices last week. </TEXT></DOC>
