What are therules for filing an expense report? Who handles customer complaints, and how?andO;What steps are required  to announce a new product, organize a customerseminar, change a price or qualify a new supplier?andM;These common business tasks follow standard procedures.andP;  Although some of thesteps that they require--mollifying a disgruntled customer, perhaps, oranticipating the psychology behind setting a product's price--may require aunique human insight, it's the process itself, the rules for getting the jobdone  right,&quot; that dominates these activities.andM;These are jobs in which the individual factor should be minimized andconsistency of approach, effort and result should rule.andM;Traditionally, software has dealt poorly with routine business proceduressuch as these.andP;  Standard productivity programs aim to be integral elements ofautomated business processes., yet they can't describe them.andP;  Expert systemsfocus entirely on the result of a process, not on tracking the steps alongthe way.andM;Now, AllClear, a $299.95 program developed under the direction of VadimYasinovsky (whose company, Clear Software, also produces Clear for C, whichconverts C code into neatly drawn flow charts, and Clear for DBASE, whichdoes the same task using DBASE code), admirably handles the chore ofclarifying what's needed to accomplish a task.andM;AllClear automatically generates a flow chart or diagram of any set ofprocedures or decision steps.andP;  This graphic depiction of business activity isderived from straightforward statements, written in business English by theuser, that describe the sequence of events and options that constitute anaccepted norm for a specific task.andM;The program takes these human &quot;programs&quot;--the accepted rules for performingdefined business operations--and transforms them from a series of verbalsteps, rules and choices into a neatly drawn &quot;map&quot; of what a worker must do.andO;This is valuable because too often inefficiencies, logical gaps, loops andother problems in procedures can be obscured by the language used to describethem, making a narrative of instructions more harm than help.andP;  An AllClearchart sweeps away the verbiage, creating a clear view of the task, hence theproduct's name.andM;AllClear works because it lets the user describe processes naturally.andP;  Thesoftware then uses an expert-system-style approach to perform all the hardstuff on its own, converting business language into operational rules thatcan be graphically displayed.andM;AllClear tries to anticipate the user's aims.andP;  Type a colon, for example, andthe program displays a set of numbers next to which you can list alternativeactions.andP;  End a line with a question mark, and AllClear anticipates that ayes or no option will follow.andP;  Type a sentence, ending it with a period, andthe program considers it a sequential step in the process.andM;Instead of forcing the business user to work with a complex syntax, AllClearstretches to comprehend human styles.andM;Rather than automate a business process, which is what PC software hascharacteristically sought to do, AllClear solves the critical but neglectedproblem of delineating how the process works.andM;I can imagine the remarks from AllClear users-remarks such as,  Oops, wenever figured out what to do if the recipient doesn't have a fax or telexmachine,&quot; or, &quot;Now we know what to do when people go on vacation, but how dowe handle transferring the unfinished work back to them when they return?&quot; Infact, I'd like to use this product to diagram one of my pet peeves:voice-mail systems that send you into the blue yonder after 10 sets of &quot;Pressone if....&quot; I'm sure the reason that these things loop endlessly would becomeapparent right away with AllClear.andM;While conducting market research for the product, Yasinovsky was surprised todiscover how many flow charts are actually in business use--pilots' manuals,product-assembly instructions and patent applications  including ClearSoftware's).andP;  Tree structures abound as well-for organizational charts, billof materials breakdowns or anything that can also be represented as anoutline.andM;What attracts me about this program is that it focuses on personalproductivity, regardless of whether the computer is part of the task.andP;  Asyou've often heard, if you automate a mess, you get an automated mess.andP;  Withthinking tools such as AllClear, you may be able to get rid of the messbefore you automate.andM;More information about AllClear can be obtained by contacting Clear SoftwareInc. at 1440 Beacon St., P.O.
