Terms weren't disclosed.    Sandoz is owned by Sandoz Ltd. of Switzerland, a seed and pharmaceutical company. Minneapolis-based Northrup King supplies agricultural, vegetable and packet seeds throughout the U.S. By purchasing Stauffer Seeds, a Westport, Conn., hybrid corn seed company that operates mainly in the Midwest, Sandoz said it will increase its role in the Corn Belt, where it hasn't been particularly strong.    Stauffer Chemical is a unit of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc., which is selling some operations that don't fit in with its strategic plans. Westport, Conn.-based Chesebrough-Pond's, which makes and sells consumer and chemical products, was recently acquired by Unilever U.S. Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
