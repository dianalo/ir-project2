The owner and operator of 7-Eleven stores, burdened by amonstrous debt load taken on when it went private in 1987,said its current financial forecasts indicate that it will bein violation of its bank-credit agreements during this yearand added that it doesn't believe it will be able to winneeded waivers unless it can reduce its debt.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, Southland said that its auditors haveincluded a paragraph in their year-end review of itsfinancial statements noting that there is &quot;substantial doubt&quot;about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.   The massive loss and the gloomy projections, the mostominous signs yet of the company's worsening financialposition, follow Southland's disclosure last week that it hasagreed to sell 75% of its equity to its Japanese licenseesfor $400 million. However, that agreement is contingent onSouthland's convincing holders of about $1.8 billion inpublic debt to swap their debentures for stock andzero-coupon bonds. The proposal already has met resistancefrom bondholders, who don't want to give up cash interestpayments and who fret that the founding Thompson family isretaining too much of the company at their expense.   Southland's bleak predictions may also be a warning tobondholders balking at the proposed restructuring. But JackAckerman of Bond Review Co., whose investment advisorycompany is working with Southland bondholders, said theholders still will want to know why they can't receive atleast some cash interest on new debt issues.   &quot;Our preference is to do an out-of-bankruptcy settlementif possible,&quot; he said, although some bondholders have saidthey wouldn't mind working out a plan under courtsupervision. Although Southland isn't expected to officiallypropose its debt-swap offer until later this month, thebondholders already have formed a steering committee and hopeto meet with company officials soon.   In the meantime, the company said it received waivers fromcertain bank covenants from its senior bank group, which isowed about $924 million, but the agreement requires it tosubmit a restructuring plan before May 31 and complete therestructuring by Dec. 1.   While a Southland spokeswoman conceded that the company'sfinancial position is troubled, she said the company isconfident that it has begun work on a restructuring plan&quot;well in advance&quot; of a crisis.   In disclosing its quarterly loss, Southland said itdecided to take the huge write-off of good will, or theamount over the fair value of the assets acquired in thecompany's $4.9 billion leveraged buy-out, after it and itsauditor, Deloitte andamp; Touche, evaluated the convenience storeindustry and tried to determine the true value of that goodwill. As the good will initially was to be amortized over 40years, the write-off eliminates a $26 million-a-year non-cashexpense and won't affect Southland's liquidity or its taxliabilities.   In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Southland had a netloss of $37 million. Revenue for the latest fourth quarterwas $2.06 billion, up 4.4% from $1.97 billion in the 1988period. The company said that, on an inflation-adjustedbasis, its merchandise sales at stores open more than a yearfell, as did its gasoline profits. The company attributed thedecline in gasoline profits to its fewer stores owned and toa drop in gas sales per store, a possible reflection of itsdecision to sell a brand-name gas and to abandon its policyof offering the cheapest price on the block.   For the year, Southland had a loss of $1.32 billion,compared with a loss of $285.2 million in 1988. In additionto the write-off of good will, the company had a $56 millioncharge related to a debt swap a year ago and $69.4 million inincome from discontinued operations. The year-ago resultsalso included $69 million in profit from discontinuedoperations.   Revenue for the year was $8.35 billion, up 4.5% from $7.99billion in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
