The Buffalo, N.Y., banking concern also confirmed it is considering the sale of one or more of its units, including its New York City branches, to boost capital.    In the year-ago quarter, Goldome had net income of $14.6 million, or 52 cents a share, including extraordinary credits of $8.5 million. In the 1987 fourth quarter, it had a $12.8 million loss. Goldome has consolidated assets of $15.1 billion.    Ross B. Kenzie, chairman and chief executive officer, said the latest loss reflected a decreased net interest margin from higher deposit costs, decreased securities gains, and higher operating expenses. He said Goldome is trying to determine the value of a number of its units &quot;so that a judgment can be made on whether any of them should be sold at this time.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Goldome closed at $3.50 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
