But the sleeping giant has begun to stir, analysts say.   ``What you'll see is the dawning of a new age in long-distance,beginning now, where ATandamp;T goes from being a benevolent giant tobeing a real nasty monster,'' said Jack Grubman, a PaineWebber Inc.telecommunications analyst.   This new aggressiveness is likely to mean slower growth forATandamp;T's rivals, notably the two largest, MCI Communications Corp. andUS Sprint Communications Co., but analysts expect that the rapidpace of this $50 billion-a-year industry will help them sustainhealthy growth.   MCI's earnings, for example, ``will increase but instead of 385percent this year, they will increase 88 percent next year,''predicted Robert Morris III of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. ``It's still anawfully attractive rate of growth, and better than the market.''   ATandamp;T has been modernizing its network during the five years sincethe Bell System was broken up Jan. 1, 1984, and offering newservices, but Grubman says that for the most part the company hasbeen relatively passive, letting competition take hold to justifythe divestiture.   However, now that ATandamp;T's overall share of the long-distancemarket has slipped from close to 90 percent at divestiture into the70 percent range, the company is sending signals that it plans tobecome far more aggressive, Grubman said.   ATandamp;T Vice Chairman Randall L. Tobias rejects Grubman's scenario,saying, ``We've been aggressive in everything we've done.'' However,he said, ``the characterization that we're getting more aggressiveis fair.''   ATandamp;T is pushing hard for more pricing flexibility from federalregulators to put it on the same footing as its unfettered rivals.As part of that effort, ATandamp;T is lobbying the Federal CommunicationsCommission to adopt a new regulatory structure that would set upperand lower limits on prices.   As it is now, rates are based on a calculation of how much profitATandamp;T can make in comparison to the size of its asset base.   ATandamp;T also has been coming out with new products and services thatare direct responses to offerings of MCI and US Sprint.Additionally, ATandamp;T has been beefing up its sales and marketing staffand recently announced plans to cut thousands of jobs and take a$6.7 billion charge against fourth-quarter earnings to coverexpenses related to removing outdated phone equipment.   Although the charge will result in the first annual loss inATandamp;T's 103-year history, analysts said it showed the company'sdetermination to become more competitive.   ``I think they are going to unleash fast and furiously a lot ofcreative pricing plans, for large customers in particular, andthey'll be able to maintain high profitability because there's a lotof costs they can shed but had no incentive to do under(profit-limiting) rate-of-return regulation,'' Grubman said.   With nearly 2.7 million shareowners, ATandamp;T is still the mostwidely held stock of any U.S. company.   ATandamp;T's earnings suffered in the first three years afterdivestiture, but in 1987 a corporate refocusing helped the companypost record earnings of $2 billion, or $1.88 per share, on revenuesof $34 billion. Net income was up 8.2 percent the first nine monthsof this year.   ATandamp;T's share of the market has dropped to around 70 percent interms of minutes of use of its network, but in terms of its revenuesthe company commands a larger share, estimated usually at more than75 percent, because its prices are generally higher than those ofits rivals.   MCI, now a $6 billion-a-year company, has had a startlingly goodyear, with earnings through the third quarter up nearly four-fold onsteadily rising revenues from 800 and international services andgains in commercial accounts.   ``MCI has become a truly viable alternative to ATandamp;T,'' saidEdward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., who estimates that MCI hasabout 11 percent of the long-distance business.   According to his survey of corporate telecommunicationsexecutives at the start of the year, 38 percent said that by 1990they would choose MCI as their main long-distance company, comparedwith 11 percent in his 1987 survey.   US Sprint, with about $4 billion in annual revenues and anestimated 7 percent share of the long-distance pie, is stillstruggling to turn a profit. But with its nationwide fiber-opticnetwork complete, analysts believe it will find its footing soon.   ``Sprint is starting'' to become a contender, Greenberg said.``We're seeing them get large contracts with major players. Ifthey're not there yet, they're darn close to it.''   ATandamp;T, MCI and US Sprint all are looking over their shoulders atthe regional Bell operating companies, spun off from ATandamp;T in thedivestiture and anxious to have restrictions on their businesseslifted so they can get into the long-distance business.   ``The most fundamental thing that could just be the biggest stepbackwards on all of the positive things that have happened (sincedivestiture) would be if the Bell operating companies were allowedinto long-distance,'' said Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI president.   ``That's really the Roman candle,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Dec. 11</NOTE></DOC>
