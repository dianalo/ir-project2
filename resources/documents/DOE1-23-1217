The aim ofthe meeting was to discuss the processes and mechanisms underlying thetransfer of pollutants and contaminants in ecological systems. The discussionof the impact of pollutants on individual organisms, populations andcommunities was specifically excluded. Parallels between transfer, distributionand fate of a wide range of materials were identified. The papers presentedat the meeting provided examples of mechanisms and processes involvedin pollutant transport through ecosystems as well as of the significanceof long-term or widespread investigations in the identification of temporalor geographical trends. Examples were also provided of studies involvingcomplex systems and diverse materials with the aim of identifying underlyingprinciples. Topics of current environmental concern e.g. acid deposition,heavy metals, radioactivity, etc. for which information is being collatedin order to provide a basis for assessments concerning future impactwere presented. Such assessments will require a combination of the informationon transport and fate within ecosystems with knowledge of the effectsof pollutants on the system. The interpretation of data concerning effectsof a pollutant needs to be placed in the wider context of the occurrence,distribution and fate of that pollutant. The purpose of this publicationis to provide that wider context.</TEXT></DOC>
