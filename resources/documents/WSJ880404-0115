The total number of companies whose shares are traded on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system rose by 40 a month, on average, in the first three quarters of last year. By the end of September, it stood at a record 4,781 -- about 8% more than at the end of 1986.    Since the crash, however, the net flow has been reversed. Investors in the OTC market have had about 25 fewer companies to pick from each month. The Nasdaq total stood at 4,654 at the end of February, the latest month for which figures are available.    Hundreds of Nasdaq listings change every quarter as a result of new listings and departures because of mergers, bankruptcies, moves to stock exchanges or other reasons. In recent years the number of additions had exceeded the number leaving.    Traders and industry officials blame the reversal of that trend on the sharp drop-off in initial public offerings, or IPOs.    The OTC market did lose some major companies amid the widely publicized trading problems surrounding the crash. Recent defectors to the New York Stock Exchange include Genentech, Symbol Technologies, Apple Bank for Savings, Dime Savings Bank of New York, Birmingham Steel and Businessland. Others were dropped by Nasdaq after the crash because they no longer met standards for trading on the system.    But more significant, say officials and market participants, has been the fall off in the number of new issues. &quot;A lot of Nasdaq growth has been due to IPOs, and when the October situation developed, the IPO market dried up,&quot; says John L. Jacobs, Nasdaq's company-qualifications manager. &quot;We're not adding as many because of the environment,&quot; Mr. Jacobs says.    E.E. &quot;Buzzy&quot; Geduld, president of Herzog Heine Geduld Inc., which trades OTC issues for other brokers, notes that there were sometimes eight or 10 new issues a day last spring &quot;when the market was really boiling.&quot; He figures there haven't been more than 10 major new issues in the more than five months since the crash.    Market participants say the development doesn't bother them. &quot;We go through these cycles,&quot; says John Watson, president of the National Security Traders Association, most of whose members are OTC brokers. &quot;There are certain times conducive to bringing out new offerings.&quot;    Moreover, many OTC executives say there are signs that this shrinking act on the still-sprawling market is reversing. &quot;The market environment has changed,&quot; says Arthur Pacheco, who runs OTC trading at Cantor Fitzgerald andamp; Co. and is president of the Security Traders Association of New York.    &quot;In the last month or so we have seen some new IPOs, some relatively successful ones,&quot; Mr. Pacheco says. &quot;For the rest of the year, unless something drastic happens, I think we'll have a reversal of the trend.&quot;    Whatever the case, OTC executives emphasize that there is still plenty of choice for investors on Nasdaq. &quot;There's still an awful lot of companies on there,&quot; says Mr. Watson.    There are also more Nasdaq issues than companies, because some companies list more than one class of stock. The number of issues traded generally is about 900 higher than the number of companies; this ratio has remained consistent before and after the Oct. 19 crash.    So, despite the post-crash shrinkage, Nasdaq still handles 5,461 issues -- more than twice the number of issues as the New York and American exchanges combined. </TEXT></DOC>
