Such a move would mark the second major retreat fromdiversification by Ford in recent months. The No. 2 U.S. automaker already has announced that it wants to sell its FordAerospace unit. The company wants to free capital and otherresources to concentrate on the increasingly competitive autoindustry worldwide, and to expand its financial-servicesoperations.</LP><TEXT>   Just three years ago Ford was aggressively expanding intothe agricultural-equipment business. The auto maker boughtthe New Holland division of Sperry Corp. for $330 million andcombined it with the Ford Tractor division to form Ford NewHolland in January 1987. Later that year, Ford purchasedVersatile Corp., which makes large four-wheel drive tractors.   In all, Ford New Holland had sales of about $3 billionlast year. While significant by farm-equipment industrystandards, that was just a small portion of Ford's overallrevenue of $96.15 billion in 1989.   An announcement of the Ford-Fiat discussions could come asearly as today, said one individual familiar with the talks.A Ford official referred inquiries to the Ford New Hollandsubsidiary, where a spokesman said he wouldn't &quot;comment onspeculation.&quot;   Ford and Fiat have a mixed record on completing deals. Inthe mid-1980s they held intense and prolonged discussionsabout merging their European automotive operations. But thediscussions fell apart when each side insisted on havingcontrol of the combined business.   However, the two companies are partners in the heavy-truckbusiness in Europe. It's possible, said one industry insider,that Fiat could swap its interest in that operation in returnfor acquiring Ford New Holland.   Taking over Ford New Holland would make Fiat an instantpowerhouse in the U.S. as farmers continue their recentbuying spree. Its chief rivals would be Deere andamp; Co. and theJI Case unit of Tenneco Inc., which makes Case Internationalfarm equipment.   Fiat's Geotech farm-equipment unit, which has majoroperations in Europe, already owns Hesston Corp. in the U.S.,a relatively small maker of farm implements. It wasn'timmediately clear what a Fiat purchase of New Holland wouldmean for the joint venture that Hesston has with Case to makehay and forage equipment.   However, if a deal is completed, it would &quot;open up anentire new market for exports of small farm tractors Fiatbuilds in Europe,&quot; said John Stark, editor of Stark'sOff-Highway Ledger, a Chicagobased trade publication. &quot;Italso gives Fiat flexibility for competing with Japanese{farm-equipment} companies in Europe in 1992.&quot;   In the U.S., Fiat would face the same challenge thatplagues Ford: Ford New Holland's tractors and farm equipmenthave loyal customers in what industry officials call the&quot;horseshoe&quot; from the East Coast through the South and up theWest Coast. But it is relatively weak in the heartland, whereDeere and Case are dominant.   Ford New Holland has about 17,000 employees and doesbusiness in 120 countries, but most of its sales are in NorthAmerica and Europe. Besides tractors, it makes combines,forage equipment and hay-making machines.</TEXT></DOC>
