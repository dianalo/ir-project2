Sort of.   In an effort to boost customer traffic at its stores, thehamburger chain plans to allow automated videotape dispenserkiosks on some of its restaurant parking lots. The agreementwith Videomatic International Inc. gives Burger Kingexclusive fast-food location rights to the movie-rentalkiosks for 20 years.</LP><TEXT>   The kiosks, which use robotic arms to deliver and retrievetapes, require no employees and operate around the clock.Payment is made by credit card. Outlets are stocked withmultiple titles of recent Hollywood releases.   &quot;We're selling convenience,&quot; said Videomatic Chairman FredDiGiorgio, whose Ontario, Calif., company manufactures andfranchises the automated outlets.   The apparent hope is that customers renting, or returning,a tape also would stop into the restaurant for a bite to eat.   &quot;We want to leverage our 5,500 points of distribution,&quot; aBurger King spokesman said. No sites have yet been chosen forthe videotape outlets, he said. But he added that Burger Kingfranchisees would be given the option of renting space inparking lots they owned, or perhaps even of becoming aVideomatic franchisee as well.   Many franchisee restaurants are on land owned by thecompany, a unit of London's Grand Metropolitan PLC.   Other parking-lot operators with dispensers include asupermarket in Plantation, Fla., a California paint-storechain, several bowling-lane operators and a 1,700-unitapartment house in Atlanta. In addition to the stand-alonemodel, the movie-rental dispensers may be built intostorefronts or strip malls.   The Burger King arrangement has its early skeptics. &quot;It'sone more thing to take our focus off of our business,&quot; saidan unconvinced Midwestern Burger King franchisee. He notedthat rival McDonald's Corp. doesn't allow its franchisees tooperate other businesses for just that reason.</TEXT></DOC>
