<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-0896 </DOCNO><TEXT>A thermodynamic analysis of the vapour absorption heat pump working onR22-DMETEG pair is made and the results are presented in the form ofgraphs and correlations. These data can be used to estimate the idealisedsystem performance parameters such as heat quantities, flow rates, pumpwork, COP and second law efficiency. The procedure for using the datafor above computations is described.</TEXT></DOC>
