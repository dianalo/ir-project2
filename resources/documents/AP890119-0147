Construction of both single-family homes and apartments fellduring 1988 to leave total housing starts at 1.49 million units. Itwas the poorest showing since the recession year of 1982 when 1.06million units were built.   Analysts said that despite the decline, which is likely tocontinue into the current year, 1988 was a good year for the housingindustry because the level of construction remained relatively high.   ``We do not get very concerned when we're building over a millionsingle-family homes a year,'' said Dale Stuard, president of theNational Association of Homebuilders.   ``There's nothing to get panicky about,'' he said. ``It's a verycontrolled slowdown.''   Analysts said the decline had been expected because much of thepent-up demand for homes that developed during the recession wassatisfied in subsequent boom years, and housing requirements aredecreasing with the aging of the Baby Boom generation.   In addition, mortgage interest rates are inching upward. Intereston fixed-rate mortgages reached 10.81 percent last week, accordingto the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   Economist Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions said the housing industry ``held up reasonably well,all things considered. Nonetheless, it is a decline and I thinkwe'll see a little further decline in 1989.''   Housing construction reached its post-recession peak in 1986,when 1.81 units were built, then began sliding. Analysts believefurther decreases are inevitable as interest rates continue to rise,the economic expansion runs its course and demographics take theirtoll.   ``As we go through the years toward the year 2000, we need fewerand fewer net additions to our stock of housing,'' said economistRichard Peach of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.``We're just not creating as many new households as we used to.''   December's seasonally adjusted annual construction rate of 1.52million units was down a moderate 2.2 percent from a month earlier.   ``The small drop from November is encouraging, and suggests thatthe housing sector will start 1989 with good momentum,'' said JohnA. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association ofRealtors.   Building permits, considered a good indication of futureactivity, were up 1.8 percent in December to an annual rate of 1.54million units. For the year, building permits totaled 1.46 millionunits, down from 1.53 million a year earlier.   Single-family homes in December were built at a seasonallyadjusted annual rate of 1.11 million units, down 1.9 percent from amonth earlier. For the year, single-family home construction dropped5.8 percent to 1.08 million units.   Apartment construction, always volatile, reached an annual rateof 410,000 units during December, down 3.1 percent from a monthearlier. For the year, construction was down 14.1 percent to 407,000units.   The apartment sector has been plagued by widespread overbuildingand changes in federal tax law that removed many of the incentivesfor investing in rental projects.   All four regions of the country experienced decreased housingstarts during the year, with construction in the Northeast down 12.5percent, the South down 9.3 percent, the Midwest down 8.5 percentand the West down 3.6 percent.   But construction in the Midwest shot up 25.1 percent in Decemberto a seasonally adjusted 329,000 units, the fourth straight monthlyincrease. Peach said the recent gains indicate the region ``is on alonger-term trend of recovery from the days when everyone called itthe Rust Belt.''   The Northeast, meanwhile, was down 20.1 percent in December to179,000 units, reflecting a slowdown after strong expansion earlier.   Economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of SavingsInstitutions said there could be ``cause for concern'' if theslowdown in the Northeast continues, but that the downward movementthus far was not alarming.</TEXT></DOC>
