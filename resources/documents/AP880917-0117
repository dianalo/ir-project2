Ash-Shiraa cited no sources for its report that Waite will bereleased ``as a result of an orchestration between Britain andIran, including London's denunciation of Iraq for using chemicalweapons against the Kurds.''   Ash-Shiraa broke the story of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in1986, but has not been accurate in its recent reporting on foreignhostages in Lebanon, including several reports that hostages wouldbe released imminently.   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 after leaving a seasidehotel in Moslem west Beirut to negotiate with kidnappers ofAmerican hostages.   There has been no confirmed claim of responsibility for hisabduction.   Ash-Shiraa said Iran ``is now directly in charge of thehostages' affairs in Lebanon.''   The report said the release of German hostage Rudolf Cordes onMonday ``sparked anger and confusion within Hezbollah (Party ofGod) because it was carried out without consulting the party.''   Hezbollah, made up of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to Iran'sAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, is believed to be the umbrella groupfor those holding foreign hostages in Lebanon.   Cordes' release leaves 17 foreigners missing in Lebanon,including nine Americans.   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped in Beiruton March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
