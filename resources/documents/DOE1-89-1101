<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-1101 </DOCNO><TEXT>It has recently been shown that inhalation of high levels of diesel exhaustcan produce lung tumors in rats. The particulate phase, consisting ofcarbonaceous particles with adsorbed organic compounds, appears to beparticularly important because exposure to the gas phase has not resultedin tumors. Therefore, knowledge of the fate of both the particles andadsorbed organic compounds will aid in determining mechanisms responsiblefor lung tumor induction. Accumulations of diesel soot in lungs of rodentsexposed to diesel exhaust has been a predominant feature of long-termexposures. Impaired clearance of particles has also been an importantfeature of diesel exhaust exposures and appears to be a prime reasonfor the accumulations of large lung burdens of diesel soot. Availabledata are examined in this paper to provide insights into dose-responserelationships, i.e., exposure conditions that are likely to produce impairedparticle clearance and adverse health effects.</TEXT></DOC>
