Steven Smith, 23, had admitted killing Dr. Kathryn Hinnant atBellevue Hospital last Jan. 7. But his lawyer said he was insaneand therefore not responsible for the crimes.   The jury, however, accepted a prosecutor's assertion that Smithwas aware of his actions and that his insanity defense was a ruseto escape punishment. The jury deliberated for only two hours.   The Manhattan jury convicted Smith of all counts he faced:murder, rape, robbery and sodomy. Smith, who faces a maximum of 50years to life in prison, showed no emotion.   State Supreme Court Justice James Leff set sentencing for Nov.21. Supreme Court is the name of the regular trial court in NewYork.   The defendant's mother, Marian Smith, said, ``He didn't have aghost of a chance with the ghosts in that courtroom.''   Hinnant, 33, was five months pregnant when she was attacked inher fourth-floor office-laboratory at the massive 1,200-bedhospital. Her husband, Eric Johnson, and a hospital administratorfound her body the next day.   According to trial testimony, Smith told police he sometimesslept in a storeroom on the hospital's 22nd floor and walked aroundunnoticed in surgical garb and carrying a stethoscope. He claimedhe watched operations, slept in the doctor's quarters and visitedpatients' roomms.   Smith's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, argued that Smith deliberatelyleft clues at the scene so police could find and hospitalize him.   As proof of Smith's insanity, Kornberg cited medical recordsdating back to when his client was 14. Almost all of them say Smithhas low intelligence and is delusional, that he hallucinates andhears voices.   A psychiatrist who testified for the defense said Smith appearedto have a psychosis related to schizophrenia.   Smith initially told police he had an accomplice named ``John.''Kornberg said John was a delusion, that the defendant reallythought this person had punched and raped Hinnant and then helpedhim kill her.   ``The man is mentally sick,'' Kornberg told jurors. ``The man isnot criminally responsible for what he does.''   But Assistant District Attorney James Kindler argued that Smithis sane. ``He was aware of what murder was, and he was aware thatKathryn Hinnant was murdered,'' Kindler said. ``So why is insanitya defense?''   Kindler said Smith invented stories about hearing voices,compulsive behavior and ``John'' because he was trying to escaperesponsibility for what he did. As for fingerprints and other cluesat the scene, Kindler said, they show Smith was sloppy, carelessand unlucky, but they don't show that he was crazy.</TEXT></DOC>
