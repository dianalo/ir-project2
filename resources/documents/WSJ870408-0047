Now one has done just that.    Walt Disney Co. plans to begin circulating nearly $2 million worth of its own pastel-colored currency May 5 at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. If all goes as planned, officials of the entertainment company say additional millions will go into circulation three months later at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.    The currency initially will be available in only two denominations: A $1 bill featuring Mickey Mouse and a $5 bill with Goofy. But company officials insist &quot;this isn't funny money.&quot;    &quot;Disney Dollars&quot; will be offered as change upon request during regular transactions at Disneyland. The currency can be used to pay for admission, food and merchandise or can be redeemed at special stands for the equivalent in U.S. currency, says Jack Lindquist, vice president of marketing.    Plans include changing the bills' designs every year and expanding into other denominations. Mr. Lindquist says the currency is designed so that tourists who don't spend it all during a visit can redeem it, if they wish, on subsequent trips.    Observers doubt that many of the Disney dollars will ever be redeemed; instead, most will end up on collectors' shelves, they say. Disneyana collectors, as the aficionados are called, pay as much as $400 for Disney-related gum wrappers dating back to the 1930s and thousands of dollars for original cartoon drawings.    &quot;The collectors' market could easily swallow up half of those and they'd never get used,&quot; says Tom Tumbusch, a Dayton, Ohio, author of the three-volume Tomart's Illustrated Disneyana Catalog and Price Guide. Mr. Tumbusch says some collectors are so enthused that they go to banks at the theme parks to have special Disney checks drafted without any intention of cashing them. In addition, many hold on to stock certificates that predate the company's name change last year from Walt Disney Productions, making the certificates worth more than their market price, he adds.    Disney, which declines to disclose the cost of printing the currency, says this may be &quot;the first time money has been printed to actually replace U.S. currency.&quot; And U.S. Banknote Co., a New York-based producer of secured documents that engraved the currency, says it is the first time that four-color processing has been used in printing currency.    The process, which is favored by glossy magazines for its high resolution, is being used to print images of Disney sites and faces of the famous cartoon characters on the bills. In addition, Intaglio printing, a process that lends &quot;the feel of steel&quot; to currency by giving a raised and abrasive quality to lettering, has been used on the bills' borders, denominations and serial numbers.    Disney claims that the combination of the two processes, along with a latent image, a distinctive watermark, a unique numbering series, unusual colored paper and a precise relationship between the bills' obverse and reverse sides give the bills more anti-counterfeiting traits than U.S. currency.    But the U.S. government, which hasn't any objection to Disney printing its own version of the venerable greenback, demurs. &quot;It's unlikely,&quot; says William Corbett, a special agent with the Secret Service, which is in charge of policing counterfeiting practices. &quot;I feel quite certain they couldn't know how many steps the U.S. Treasury and the Bureau of Engraving have taken against counterfeiting.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
