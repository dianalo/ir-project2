Mr. Cristiani, a 40-year-old businessman with scant political experience, last month won the presidential nomination of the Republican Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena, the rightist party founded by Mr. D'Aubuisson, whose alleged links to death squads made him the bane of U.S. policy-makers. With Arena surging nationally and the moderate opposition in disarray, Mr. Cristiani is favored to win next spring's presidential election.    Not long ago, the prospect of an Arena win would have sent tremors through Washington. Indeed, there is evidence the Central Intelligence Agency funneled thousands of dollars to the 1984 presidential campaign of Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte, who beat Mr. D'Aubuisson that year but now is dying of cancer. What's more, death squad activity has been picking up this year, though it remains far below the level of killings in 1980-82, when an average of 800 persons died each month, according to human rights groups.    Yet this time around, the U.S. seems ready to accept an Arena presidency, and it is making an effort to warm up to Mr. Cristiani. For his part, Freddy, as Mr. Cristiani is known to most Salvadorans, is working to moderate Arena's image, as electoral success will count for little if Washington slashes badly needed military and economic aid.    The previous U.S. policy, which tried to defeat Marxist guerrillas by building a political middle in this polarized land, hasn't worked. After years of backing Mr. Duarte's moderate Christian Democrats -- and seeing them squander their political support through corruption and bungling the economy and the war -- Washington is hinting its future counterinsurgency partner could be the far right.    A tall, balding, soft-spoken millionaire whose jeep is so weighed down with bullet-proofing that it gets just six miles to the gallon, Mr. Cristiani shares Mr. D'Aubuisson's conservative views. He worries that a U.S.-imposed &quot;human-rights psychosis&quot; cripples the military in its war with the guerrillas. &quot;It has arrived to such an extreme that they don't do anything for fear of being accused of being human-rights violators,&quot; he says, adding that the army could be more aggressive without killing innocent civilians.    Like many Salvadoran conservatives, he sees Mr. D'Aubuisson as a visionary whose founding of Arena in 1982 &quot;really legitimized the democratic process.&quot; He doesn't believe the reports linking the party founder to terrorism -- &quot;I've never seen any proof&quot; -- and says of his relationship with Mr. D'Aubuisson: &quot;There is a lot of mutual respect between us.&quot;    Though U.S. officials talk of an Arena divided between Mr. D'Aubuisson's &quot;dark forces&quot; and &quot;moderates&quot; such as Mr. Cristiani, there is little evidence of such a split. Yet differences of style between the two men abound. Mr. Cristiani, a Georgetown University graduate, is understated, conciliatory and respected as a business manager. He was born and married to wealth; he and his wife come from old-line coffee families, and his family also has a pharmaceuticals business. In 1980, guerrillas held him hostage for 14 days when they seized the Economy Ministry, where he had gone to visit the minister. Mr. Cristiani says most of his captors were poor peasants, lacking political savvy, who &quot;were tricked into believing.&quot;    The U.S. Embassy regularly invites Mr. Cristiani, who speaks near-perfect English, to receptions and dinners, and when he recently visited Washington, it arranged for him to meet the top U.S. policy-makers on Latin America, from Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams on down.    All of that contrasts sharply with the 44-year-old Mr. D'Aubuisson, a bombastic, unpredictable former military intelligence officer who is shunned by the embassy and can't even travel to the U.S. without a waiver of its anti-terrorist laws. He has never been officially charged with a crime, but he has been linked by human-rights groups, political opponents and U.S. diplomats to such violent acts as the 1980 assassination of Roman Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero. Mr. D'Aubuisson always has denied such charges. But he realizes his international reputation hurts Arena.    &quot;I know my name is controversial, especially in the United States,&quot; he says, with a hint of bitterness. &quot;Why should I, given that American public opinion is completely misinformed, continue damaging a party I love?&quot;    Diplomats and others say Mr. D'Aubuisson still holds great sway in Arena. He serves in the National Assembly and retains the title of the party's honorary president for life. With his good looks and swashbuckling style, the former National Guard major is still a vote-getter with his own followers. Observers think Mr. D'Aubuisson would have great influence in a Cristiani presidency.    &quot;Freddy is very pleasant, very moderate, very mediocre -- he'd make a good diplomat,&quot; says a European diplomat. &quot;But when election time comes, it's D'Aubuisson who puts on the tight jeans to go out and win votes.&quot;    Says Richard McCall, an aide to Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, &quot;There is strong concern across the board about who controls Arena.&quot;    While the answer isn't clear, it is clear that Mr. Cristiani, who has headed Arena since Mr. D'Aubuisson stepped aside for him in 1986, has altered the tone of its campaigning. As campaign leader for March's legislative elections, he steered the party away from personal attacks on opponents. Arena also dropped its stunt of past elections in which Mr. D'Aubuisson would slash a watermelon to &quot;reveal&quot; the Christian Democrats, whose party color is green, as &quot;reds&quot; in disguise.    The new tone paid off. Preliminary results in the legislative elections showed Arena winning a smashing victory, carrying most municipalities and 31 of the National Assembly's 60 seats. But a recount demanded by the Christian Democrats and another party appears likely to take away one of the seats, and hence the majority.    Diplomats and Arena officials say party hot-heads demanded action, from street protests to torching the warehouse where ballots were stored. But Mr. Cristiani, with Mr. D'Aubuisson concurring, argued for taking the protest to the Supreme Court instead. The court decision is pending.    Mr. D'Aubuisson himself has toned down his style. In a recent televised debate with Ignacio Ellacuria, the leftist Jesuit rector of the Central American University, the right-wing leader rebuked a telephone caller who accused Father Ellacuria of being a communist. &quot;That would have been inconceivable three or four years ago,&quot; marvels Father Ellacuria, whose name appeared on lists of alleged communists circulated by D'Aubuisson partisans in the early 1980s.    As he relaxes in his office after a long National Assembly session, Mr. D'Aubuisson offers no apologies for his political career. &quot;There was a time when we had to be hard, against a tremendous leftist aggression&quot; he explains. &quot;Now,&quot; he adds, stripping off his tie with one hand and signaling for a vodka with the other, &quot;we're adjusting to circumstances.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
