 We have strengthin the DOS side with Intel chip-based systems and also with our Amiga68000-based products,&quot; said Randall Griffin, director of the new division.andM;The West Chester, Pa., company maintains two distinct lines of personalcomputers.andP;  The Colt and Professional Series III computers are fullyMS-DOS-compatible machines, while the Amiga series, touted for its colorgraphics and multitasking abilities, has its own operating system, but canrun MS-DOS.andM;Griffin was vice president for product management and planning for ZenithData Systems Corp. during many of that company's major federal contractawards.andM;&quot;People have said we're not coming to town as major players, and certainlywe're not IBM, but if you look at Zenit's presence in the marketplace in1983, we're not that different,&quot; Griffin said.andP;  &quot;They had no presence in thefederal marketplace at that time.andP;  Their award of Desktop I came absolutelyfrom out of nowhere.andM;&quot;All the people who were on the Beltway at the time said, 'Who is Zenith DataSystems?andP;  Just another Heathkit company.andP;  It's been very gratifying andpleasing to me as a participant at Zenith to see the growth and successthat's come since then,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We're coming to Washington now, at thebeginning, and I know Commodore is making the investment to be successful asa major player in the federal government.&quot;andM;&quot;I'm not sure I agree with that,&quot; said Francine Mendelsohn, program managerwith the Strategies for Microcomputers and Office Systems of InternationalData Corp., McLean, Va.andP;  &quot;Zenith had a reputation behind it.andP;  Commodore alsohas a reputation behind it, but it's a low-end reputation.&quot;andM;&quot;They've had a tremendous success in the schools from years ago, but if youask 10 average computer users for a one- or two- word reaction to the wordCommodore, what would it?andP;  Certainly not the words 'MS-DOS compatible' or 'PCclone,'&quot; Mendelsohn said.andM;Toying With SuccessandM;C.andP;  Lloyd Mahaffey, marketing vice-president for Commodore, said he sees noreason why past educational success cannot be carried into the government.andM;&quot;A microcomputer company can be successful in a range of markets,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;The important thing is to put the right products where they're supposed togo.andP;  We make a range of consumer technologies, and they should be presentedto the consumer market through consumer channels.andP;  We also manufacture arange of professional technologies that are directly and absolutelyapplicable to the federal arena.&quot;andM;Mahaffey, formerly with Apple Computer's Federal Systems Group, joinedCommodore in July.andP;  He said that although the Amiga uses a graphicalinterface similar to the Apple Macintosh, the company has no desire to beseen strictly as a Macintosh competitor.andM;&quot;We're not planning to ride on Apple's coattails at all,&quot; Mahaffey said.andO;&quot;The government is the most heterogeneous computing environment in the world.andO;The important thing for manufacturers to remember when they're presentingtheir technology is that No.andP;  1, it's got to meet the mission; No.andP;  2, it'sgot to be cost-effective and affordable; and No.andP;  3, it has to meet a rangeof performance standards around Posix, GOSIP and all the connectivityissues.&quot;andM;&quot;There's an opportunity for any technology that can help the government meetits mission and yet not violate the connectivity standards that are in place.andO;The Amiga, with its inherent abilit to run MS-DOS seamlessly and trulymultitask, is an interesting and useful technology to government,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;I think Commodore Federal and Mr. Mahaffey have a heck of a job ahead ofthem,&quot; Mendelsohn said.andP;  &quot;I think there's a lot of perception of Commodorefrom way back that it's not really serious about business computing, eventhough the Amiga has gotten a lot of good press.&quot;andM;&quot;The graphics are excellent on the Amiga, which is probably why Mr. Mahaffeysees it as a challenge and why they wanted him,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;Really the wholefederal marketplace in this area is virtually untapped.andP;  They just need to doa good job of letting people know, making them understand that the graphicshave been at least on par if not superior to the Mac for some time.&quot;andM;Mahaffey said that much of the reason for the low-key position of the Amigafamily lies in poor market positioning.andP;  &quot;We intend to advertise thetechnology as it hasn't been advertised before,&quot; he said.andM;Griffin said the company is already setting up a temporary federal office,with permanent facilities to open in early 1990.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
