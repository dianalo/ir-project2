The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit, reverses a lower court whichhad ordered Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III to release themoney.   An attorney for three associations representing localgovernments said an appeal of the latest decision was ``virtuallycertain.''   ``My sense is the court did not fully comprehend the nature ofour legal arguments. ... I think it's virtually certain we'll askthe court to reconsider its decision,'' said David C. Vladek, alawyer for the National Association of Counties, the NationalLeague of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and 10 city andcounty governments.   The dispute involves President Reagan's Feb. 1, 1986 order underthe Gramm-Rudman law that set aside 4.3 percent of budget items,including $180 million from that year's $4.2 billion appropriationto the revenue sharing trust fund.   The local governments argued that the law provided thatsequestered 1986 budget money should remain in government trustfunds and be paid out in 1987. They argued that even thoughCongress had abolished revenue sharing after 1986, it intended thatany money remaining in the trust fund be distributed.   Revenue sharing, begun under the Nixon administration, providednearly all local governments with unrestricted federal grants.   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green, in a ruling last July 28,found in favor of the local governments, and said Baker hadillegally transferred the revenue sharing money from the trust fundto the general fund.   However, Judge John R. Gibson, who wrote the appeals panel'sdecision reversing Judge Green, said Congress' intent with theGramm-Rudman law was clearly to reduce the federal budget deficit.   ``Merely freezing (the monies in 1986) and resuscitating them(in 1987) would not result in any meaningful deficit reduction andcould be characterized by critics to be a sham,'' said Gibson, whowas joined by Judges Patricia M. Wald and David Santelle.   ``The result in this case may be harsh, but we believe it isconsistent with congressional intent,'' wrote Gibson, who wasdesignated to the case from the U.S. Court of Appeals for theEighth Circuit in St. Louis.   Among the plaintiffs are New York City, Kansas City, Mo.;Milwaukee County, Wis., and Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includesCleveland.   The U.S. Conference of Mayors, at the time of the originaldistrict court decision last summer, had estimated that New Yorkwould receive $10 million; Chicago, $2.6 million; Los Angeles, $2.2million, and Detroit $1.3 million of the money.   Other estimates were $606,000 for New Orleans, $554,000 forIndianapolis, $677,000 for Washington, D.C., $440,000 for Denverand $104,000 for Des Moines. Estimates for other cities were notprovided.</TEXT></DOC>
