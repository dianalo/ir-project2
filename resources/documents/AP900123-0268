On other commodity markets, oil futures finished mostly lower;grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock and meat futures weremixed.   Gold futures settled $5.70 to $6.60 higher with the contract fordelivery in February up $5.70 at $413.70 a troy ounce. Silverfutures finished 2.5 cents to 2.9 cents higher with March at $5.34a troy ounce.   February gold had fallen a total of $5.70 since last Wednesday.The tumble appeared to have halted on Monday when the contract fellduring the session to $404.70, representing a loss of $6.30, thenbounced back to finish only $2.90 lower.   Monday's late rebound and Tuesday's rally appeared to stem frombuying linked to Monday's dive of more than 77 points in the DowJones industrial average, said John Jonat, a trader with DeakInternational Inc., a New York- based dealer of foreign currenciesand precious metals.   The Dow finished with a gain of nearly 15 points Tuesday butroller-coaster movement in blue-chip stocks kept investors on edgeand sent some running to the perceived safety of precious metals,Jonat said.   ``Frankly, I was a little worried when the stock market startedto move on the downside and that's what got things going'' in gold,he said.   The dollar's pronounced weakness Tuesday against other majorcurrencies also prompted some buying of gold futures, analysts said.   Analysts said technical ``buy'' signals are surfacing in thegold, silver and platinum markets, and the continued unrest inSoviet Azerbaijan is also supportive.   Most petroleum futures declined, reflecting weaker demand forheating oil and the end to an eight-day strike by Brazilianoilworkers.   The American Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory data,released after the close of trading, showed a continued expansionin U.S. supplies of gasoline and petroleum distillates but a dropin crude oil stocks.

Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange amid positioning ahead of Wednesday's quarterlyAgriculture Department cattle-on-feed report, which is expected toshow active placements of cattle onto and marketings off of feedlots in the last quarter of 1989.
