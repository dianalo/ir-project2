Crystallitesizes of nickel particles on these three catalysts after H{sub 2} reductionand CO hydrogenation were determined by Fourier analysis of a singlepeak in X-ray diffraction pattern and transmission electron microscopy.The results indicated that there existed important effects of the reducibilityof supports on catalytic activities and selectivities for CO hydrogenationas well as on the crystallite sizes of nickel particles. Compared toalumina supported nickel catalyst, nickel supported on titania and niobiawas found to have a higher activity for methanation and a higher selectivitytoward higher hydrocarbons. 8 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
