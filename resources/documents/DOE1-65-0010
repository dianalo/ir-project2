At the same time,NEB forecasters predict that Canadian electricity sales to the UnitedStates are not expected to be as high as 1987, allowing natural gas tospurt ahead in its search for market gains. The greatest advantage forAlberta natural gas is that sales are increasing in the lucrative Californiamarket. Natural gas is pouring into California as fast as transmissionpipelines can handle the flow, almost all of it in the form of long-termcontracts. California is the largest natural gas market in North Americaand, because of U.S. deregulation, transmission operations and its proximityto Alberta, it provides the greatest return to western producers. Gasexports were 989 billion ft/sup 3/ in 1987, a 33% increase over the previousyear. This represents 37% of Canadian gas production and brought in revenueof $2.6 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
