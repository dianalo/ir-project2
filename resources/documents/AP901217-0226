Amid continuing war jitters in the Gulf, the respected oilindustry newsletter said the increase was partly due to SaudiArabia hiking its daily production by 530,000 barrels to 8.33million barrels.   The Saudis are expected to boost output further this month toaround 8.63 million barrels a day, the Nicosia-based newslettersaid.   The Saudi Oil Ministry has accelerated plans to expandproduction capacity to around 10 million barrels a day in the nextfew years, a level last seen in the early 1980s.   The November increase of 970,000 barrels a day put OPECproduction at its highest level since May, when it was 23.68million barrels a day.   The survey noted that Iran's production rose in November by460,000 barrels a day, after dipping in October.   Iran's current production of 3.46 million barrels a day meansthat Iranian production is running at more or less its Septemberlevel.   Some of OPEC's 13 members sharply increased production levelsafter Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and a United Nations trade embargohalted all exports of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's leading producer, has more than doubled itsproduction since August to help make up the shortfall of around 4million barrels day because of the embargo.   Oil prices shot up after the Iraqi invasion from around $20 to$22 a barrel to a peak of about $40 a barrel.   Prices have since eased to about $27 a barrel, but renewed fearsof war in the Gulf between Iraq and a U.S.-led multinational forcecould send prices rising again.   Industry sources reported earlier this month that Saudiproduction alone could drop between 1 and 2 million barrels a dayif war breaks out in the Gulf.   The oil ministers of the OPEC countries agreed in Vienna attheir biannual conference Dec.12-13 that they will continue to setaside the organization's production quota system, designed tostabilize prices, until the crisis ends.   The last quota agreement in July, shortly before the Iraqiinvasion, established a production ceiling of 22.49 million barrelsa day and a minimum price level of $21 a barrel.   MEES Editor Ian Seymour noted that the OPEC ministers ``did notlike what they saw'' in reviewing the Gulf crisis and its impact onthe oil market.   ``The doomsday scenario under which a devastating war would leadto widespread destruction of Gulf oil facilities is a grim enoughprospect,'' Seymour said.   ``But another nightmarish possibility for the oil producers isthat a less catastrophic resolution to the crisis - that is to say,a peaceful settlement or even a short, sharp war without anysignificant damage to oil installations - followed by a renewedflow of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil to the market, could result in amassive oversupply and consequent collapse in prices to well below$15 a barrel, in the absence of prompt and effective OPEC action toreimpose production controls,'' he said.   ``The fact is that, even without the exports from Iraq orKuwait, oil supply from the other eleven OPEC members is now quitesufficient to meet world needs and could move into surplus by thesecond quarter of next year.''   Despite the agreement in Vienna on an eventual return to thequota system, Seymour said, ``Many observers are skeptical aboutthe real readiness of the surplus-capacity producers to return toquota discipline when the time comes.''   The Paris-based International Energy Agency said a week ago thatthe oil market was ``in a quite manageable balance at present''following the wild gyrations that followed the Iraqi invasion ofKuwait.   But its monthly report on the oil market noted, ``There remainslittle spare capacity in crude production.''   ``The market could still face serious problems should there beindustrial accidents, prolonged cold weather, or other distruptionsduring the winter,'' it said.   The report said that together with a significant drop in Sovietoil production, there were ``a number of sources of potentialconcern,'' including serious disruption in Gulf production if warerupts.   The U.N. Security Council approved a U.S. resolution Nov. 29giving Iraq until Jan. 15 to withdraw from Kuwait or risk anoffensive by the multinational force to liberate the conqueredemirate.   Iraq has so far given no indication it plans to pull out and hasbeen steadily boosting its military force in Kuwait and southernIraq to a current level of around 460,000 troops.   The multinational force in the Gulf is also being reinforced andshould total around 650,000 personnel by mid-January.</TEXT></DOC>
