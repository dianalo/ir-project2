To place the statement &quot;major U.S. city&quot; inperspective, I offer the following:; City Population and (Rank);            1950          1970         1980; Portland 374,000 (29)  380,000 (36) 366,000(35); San Jose  95,000 (116) 460,000 (31) 630,000 (17);    Portland electedits first woman mayor long before San Jose, and Portland in 1950 was asimportant as San Jose in 1974.;       Calvin L. DePass; Mountain View; ...; QUESTION AUTHORITY; Being on the freeway can give one the impression thatthere are some pretty grody drivers around, and your article, &quot;Put the Mettleto the Pedal&quot; (Feb. 3) only proves it.;       Barbara Broyles, driving schoolinstructor, claims to be &quot;perfecting the art of being a Good Driver.&quot; Yet sheleaves behind a trail of fellow commuters &quot;shaking their fists at her, zippingaround her,&quot; and so on.   A true Good Driver would not drive slower than theflow of traffic. A Good Driver would not startle the people behind her byslowing down for green lights, however stale they may seem.  (If it turnsyellow, there will be enough time either to stop or drive through.) A GoodDriver would not needlessly aggravate other drivers.  Traffic is aggravatingenough as it  is.;       Highway patrolman Don Guy says the freeway does notbelong to the commuters, but to him.  &quot;I'm the landlord of the freeway,&quot; hesays.  He is wrong.  He is not the landlord, but the manager.  I admire thevigilance and sense of proportion he shows on patrol, but I fear for mycountry when the policemen forget that they are public servants.  I have oftenwondered if patrol cops are actually as arrogant as they seem to the guiltyand embarrassed drivers they stop.  Now I know.;    David S. Bratman; MenloPark; ...; PUSH COMES TO SHOVE; I deeply admire Irvin Yalom's commitment tofacing the difficult truths of human existence  (&quot;Truth andamp; Consequences,&quot; Feb.10), but I am highly critical of his seemingly compulsive tendency to &quot;push&quot; his psychotherapy clients &quot;too far too fast&quot; (as evidenced by both &quot;Thelma&quot;and &quot;Dave&quot; quitting therapy with Yalom).  I would think that an experiencedand highly reflective psychotherapist such as Yalom would have realized thatsuch &quot;pushing&quot; is his problem, and thus constitutes an urgent responsibilitythat he restrain, if not resolve.;    Freud once wrote to Jung that&quot;psychoanalysis is in essence a cure through love.&quot; Freud also statedelsewhere that the basic therapeutic outcome of successful psychoanalytictreatment was the client's freer and greater ability &quot;to work and love.&quot;;      Yalom himself remarks that &quot;the best hour of therapy I ever gave&quot; wasessentially characterized by &quot;intimacy -- call it love.&quot;;     Thus, theexistentialist psychotherapist         and the psychoanalyst agree thataltruistic love is an essential quality in the most optimally therapeuticencounters.  (An insight that poets, philosophers, and ordinary people haveintuitively known since time immemorial.);    Why then does Yalom confuseauthentic love (which is, by his own account, essential to healing) withaffective illusion?  It seems to me that Yalom has strived to be not &quot;Love'sExecutioner,&quot; but rather &quot;Delusion's Destroyer.&quot;;    James Barch; Los Gatos  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  West  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NO OFFENSE, BUT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  WEST LETTERS  </MEMO><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910317  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  561  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday March 17, 199100077056,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
