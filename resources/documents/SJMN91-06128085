But some of it has practical applications.;   For instance, marine biologist Richard Zimmerman, visiting from the Universityof Chicago, is interested in eelgrass, a marsh plant from Elkhorn Slough. Theblades of most marine plants are covered with tiny, hitchhiking animals, buteelgrass stays clean. Why?;    If his work turns up the answer, Zimmermanmight be able to develop an effective and non-toxic anti-fouling agent forboat bottoms.;    Nearby, biochemist Russell Kerr extracts chemicals fromMonterey Bay sponges, looking for compounds that might make useful drugs. Sofar, a worldwide effort has turned up a handful of promising compounds,including one that is being tested as a painkiller and anti-inflammatorydrug.;    Sponges are a natural place to look. Because they're sedentaryanimals, they can't run away from their enemies and have to rely solely onchemical defenses. Some of these chemicals are poisonous to humans, but othersmight be effective in killing bacteria or suppressing tumors.;    &quot;Perhaps thecure for cancer may be lurking in some sponge somewhere,&quot; Kerr says. But evenif a potential cure is discovered, he adds, it will be a long and risky roadto get through the drug approval process and onto pharmacy shelves.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Glennda Chui, Mercury News Science Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910507  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  337  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday May 7, 199100128085,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
