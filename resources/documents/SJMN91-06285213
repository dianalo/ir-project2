Committee ChairmanJoseph Biden, D-Del., said he would not allow any.;   Thomas told thecommittee his remarks were prepared with &quot;no handlers, no advisers&quot; and wereseen in advance only by his wife, Virginia, and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., hischief Senate supporter.;   The 43-year-old Thomas is battling to save hisnomination after charges by law professor Anita Hill that he sexually harassedher a decade ago when she worked for him at the Education Department and EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission.;   Thomas said he was &quot;shocked, surprised,hurt and enormously saddened&quot; when the FBI first told him of the accusations.;  &quot;I have been racking my brains and eating my inside out trying to think whatI could have said to Anita Hill that could have led her to think I wasinterested in her in more than a professional way,&quot; he said.;   He said he&quot;categorically denied all of the allegations. . . . I have not said or donethe things that Anita Hill has alleged. God has gotten me through the dayssince Sept. 25 and he is my judge.&quot;;   But he said that if Hill or anyone elsemisconstrued anything he said, &quot;I can only say I am very sorry and I wish Ihad known.&quot;;   Thomas, who rose from rural poverty to prominence as a federaljudge, railed against the hearing process and the allegations facing him.&quot;This is Kafkaesque. This has got to stop. Enough is enough. I am not going toallow myself to be further humiliated to be confirmed. . . . This is not whatAmerica is all about.&quot;;   Thomas' wife, Virginia, sat immediately behind herhusband.;   On the eve of an unprecedented hearing that focused on Hill'scharges that Thomas sexually harassed her at the U.S. Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission, Angela Wright, a North Carolina newspaper editor, saidThomas made &quot;unwelcome and inappropriate&quot; sexual remarks to her as well.;  Wright, 37, is an assistant metropolitan editor at the Charlotte Observer, anewspaper owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., which also owns the Mercury News.;  Wright said Thomas pressured her for dates, asked about the size of herbreasts and appeared at her Washington apartment one night, unannounced anduninvited. She has been subpoenaed to testify.;   Senate Republicans said theywere ready for Wright with what they said would be damaging information abouther.;   &quot;We know she was twice dismissed from other jobs for indicating sexualharassment,&quot; said Judiciary Committee member Alan Simpson, R-Wyo. &quot;We knowthat he (Thomas) fired her for some very uncomplimentary statements aboutanother group in society.&quot;;   &quot;That's simply not true,&quot; Wright said inresponse to Simpson's description of the circumstances of her departure fromother jobs.;   Although Thomas fired Wright in 1985, he praised her in January1990 when a Charlotte Observer editor called him when checking her references.Thomas said Wright was &quot;an excellent employee&quot; who &quot;worked very well understress,&quot; according to notes taken by Mary Newsom, the newspaper's specialprojects editor.;   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is expected to cross-examinethe women at the hearing, said of the Wright statements:;   &quot;Well, that personis going to have her ass handed to her from what I've heard. This is not quitethe find people think it is,&quot; Hatch said. He accused committee Democrats of&quot;dirty tactics&quot; and &quot;another attempt to smear&quot; Thomas.;   Danforth, Thomas'close friend and prime backer in the Senate, declared buoyantly: &quot;Surprisewitnesses, last-minute-over-the-transom stuff, exactly what we predicted onthe floor on Tuesday when we delayed this.&quot;;   Asked if he was ready for thedefense, Danforth replied: &quot;Ready, able and looking forward to it withrelish.&quot;;   Wright, interviewed in Charlotte on Thursday night, said she wasnot charging Thomas with sexual harassment and never intended to file a formalcomplaint. Judiciary Committee investigators called her, apparently afterreceiving a tip.;   Once when she and Thomas attended a seminar, she said he&quot;asked me what size my breasts were. . . . He said, 'You look nice today. Whatsize are your breasts?';   &quot;I just said, 'Don't you think you ought to befamiliarizing yourself with the speakers?' &quot;;   Wright worked for Thomas asdirector of public affairs at the EEOC for about a year, from February 1984 toMarch 1985, when he was chairman. The agency is responsible for enforcingvarious federal anti-discrimination laws, including those aimed at the sexualharassment of women in the workplace.;   &quot;My desire is not to keep ClarenceThomas off the Supreme Court,&quot; Wright said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911011  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  905  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, October 11, 199100285213,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
