So I guess I should feel good.&quot;;    Yamaguchi's onemistake -- a fall on a triple Salchow -- was the only flaw in a stronglychoreographed, well put-together program. Yamaguchi, who performed first inthe final group of skaters, received scores of 5.7 and 5.8 for technical meritand 5.8 and 5.9 for artistic presentation. It was going to take a monstrouseffort to beat her.;    Harding gave that effort.;    Harding had been landingthe triple Axel -- the 3 1/2-revolution jump that is the most difficult tripleperformed -- in practice about 95 percent of the time, but prudently didn'tannounce whether she would include it in her program.;    &quot;We'd known fromabout Thursday that I'd do it,&quot; said Harding, a native of Portland, Ore.;   It was a risk. Harding, who has been working on the jump for four years, hadattempted the jump four times in competition but had been unsuccessful eachtime. Twice she had fallen, once she didn't complete it, and once she stumbledon the landing.;    But Saturday morning, Harding practiced the jump fivetimes and cleanly landed three. In the warm-up immediately preceding the finalcompetition, Harding fell once on the jump but landed it on a second attempt.So the crowd was watching for the historic feat.;    Skating in a mint greenoutfit to the theme from the movie &quot;Batman,&quot; Harding came out and immediatelyhit a triple Lutz. Then she skated across the entire rink in a dramaticbuildup for the triple Axel. Forty-five seconds into her four-minute program,Harding flew up into the air, rotated 3 1/2 times and came down cleanly,throwing her head back and lifting her clenched fists in exultation.;    Themoment was electric. The crowd knew instantly what it had witnessed and brokeinto cheers.;    &quot;It was the best,&quot; Harding, 20, said. &quot;It was overwhelming.&quot;;   Harding easily completed her program, doing five more triple jumps andending with an energetic finale to rapper Tone Loc's &quot;Wild Thing.&quot; In all, shelanded seven triple jumps and became the only woman other than Ito to includeall six types of triple jumps in a single program.;    The crowd rose to itsfeet to applaud the new national champion.;    &quot;I thought when I did my lastdouble Axel I might have it,&quot; Harding said.;    The audience celebrated againwhen Harding's scores came up. Harding received eight scores of 5.9 and theone perfect score -- from judge Roger Glenn of Appleton, Wis. -- for technicalmerit. Her scores for presentation ranged from 5.7 to 5.9.;    Nancy Kerrigan,an elegant skater from Stoneham, Mass., who recovered after falling on herfirst jump of the program -- a double Axel -- won the bronze and will joinHarding and Yamaguchi on the 1991 world team in Munich.;    This was expectedto be the year for Yamaguchi, who had toiled in the shadow of both Trenary andcompulsory figures for the past two years. With Trenary out of competitionbecause of an ankle injury and figures gone from competition, Yamaguchi wasexpected to star.;    She was in first place going into Saturday's longprogram, having easily won the short program Thursday.;    Dressed in a redoutfit bedecked with gold spangles and skating to music from the opera&quot;Sampson and Delilah,&quot; Yamaguchi presented a more sophisticated image than herdainty Juliet who charmed audiences in Baltimore two years ago.;    &quot;I thoughtshe was trying to look more like a woman out there,&quot; said Trenary, who watchedthe competition Saturday. &quot;It was a nice change.&quot;;    Yamaguchi startedstrongly but fell on the triple Salchow, a jump that has traditionally givenher trouble in competition. She also fell on it at last year's nationals.;   But Yamaguchi regained her concentration and effortlessly completed the restof her program, hitting six triples.;    But there was clearly one jump shewas missing.;    Yamaguchi is working on the triple Axel in practice, but hasyet to land it cleanly.;    &quot;She'll certainly go back and work on it,&quot; saidher coach, Christy Ness. &quot;You can't predict when a skater will get a jump . .. but it's very close.&quot;;    It needs to be. Because the future in U.S. women'sskating is now.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANN KILLION, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Minneapolis  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910217  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  947  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 17, 199100048141,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
