Now, many of his former colleagues in academia, testifying against Judge Bork's nomination, are about to show the public what extreme theories about the law look like.    Consider Owen Fiss, Judge Bork's successor as Alexander Bickel professor of public law at Yale Law School, who is one of several Yale professors scheduled to testify against the nomination. The day after President Reagan's 1984 landslide victory, Mr. Fiss boasted to a class that &quot;not only do I not know anyone who voted for Ronald Reagan, I don't know anyone who knows anyone who voted for Reagan.&quot; A first-year student from Utah stood up to broaden Mr. Fiss's horizons. &quot;Here I am, Prof. Fiss,&quot; he said.    Mr. Fiss may have been engaged in some hyperbole about political homogeneity, but maybe not. Yale Law has a strong reputation dating from the New Deal as a liberal institution. Judge Bork was a token conservative during the 15 years he taught there. Dean Guido Calabresi has told the conservative and libertarian students in the Federalist Society that they are the law school's &quot;most isolated minority.&quot; The Yale Law Journal organizers of a recent debate on the Bork nomination found five professors to speak against Judge Bork and only one, antitrust and torts expert George Priest, who favored the nomination.    The theories of the anti-Bork academics are provocative and stimulating, just as Prof. Bork's were, but these professors' understanding of the role of lawyers and judges in our society could not be more different from his. The American public, reeling from the litigation explosion and general ubiquitousness of lawyers, should pay special attention to the testimony of these philosophers of activist jurisprudence. These law professors have spent their careers justifying an ever-expanding role for judges. They dismiss the idea that judges should limit themselves to enforcing the rights actually protected in the Constitution.    In contrast, Judge Bork's judicial-restraint approach is based on the idea that the unelected judges must be the &quot;least dangerous branch.&quot; Judges should set aside laws only if the text or structure of the Constitution demands it. It is illegitimate for judges to create new rights to further their personal views or the power of their branch over the legislative and executive branches. Judge Bork has been perhaps the leading critic of judges arrogate power to themselves at the expense of the elected branches of government.    Not everyone regrets giving more power to the judiciary. Mr. Fiss is well known for his proposals to expand the role of judges through new court powers and procedures. He wants the courts to have the power to make what he calls &quot;structural injunctions,&quot; which would go well beyond the traditional use of injunctions to order someone to stop an activity or to take a specific action. Instead, Mr. Fiss says his new injunction would give judges long-term powers to &quot;effectuate the reorganization of an ongoing social institution.&quot;    Mr. Fiss argues that social engineering by courts became legitimate when judges began to use wide powers in the 1950s to run school systems. Their injunctions affect groups, not just individual litigants. Mr. Fiss does not flinch from endowing judges with powers more legislative than judicial. He urges that this power be used &quot;not just to vindicate a claim of racial equality, but also to vindicate other claims, such as the right against cruel and unusual punishment or the right to treatment.&quot;    What constraints would limit judges? Not original intent, which Mr. Fiss ridicules, but the &quot;disciplining rules&quot; of lawyers' &quot;professional grammar.&quot;    In a Yale Law Journal article entitled &quot;Against Settlement,&quot; Mr. Fiss even praises litigiousness. He says that out-of-court settlements should not be too strongly encouraged. Instead, he says the purpose of litigation is not to resolve disputes between litigants, but the &quot;more public&quot; purpose of &quot;using state power to bring a recalcitrant reality closer to our chosen ideals.&quot; In his view, the amount of litigation in the U.S. &quot;should be a source of pride rather than shame.&quot;    Paul Gewirtz, another Yale law professor, will also argue against the elevation of Judge Bork. Mr. Gewirtz is a strong proponent of the &quot;generalized&quot; right to privacy, grounded not in the Constitution, but, as Justice William Douglas put it, in the &quot;penumbras, formed by emanations&quot; from the Bill of Rights. Mr. Gewirtz has criticized the recent Bowers v. Hardwick opinion, which upheld Georgia's anti-sodomy law, as &quot;superficial, peremptory and insensitive.&quot; The case was a landmark defeat for activist lawyers.    Justice Douglas discovered the penumbra-based &quot;right to privacy&quot; in the 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut case invalidating the state's anti-contraception law, which had been brought by liberal law professors at Yale. As Judge Bork testified, Connecticut had never used the 1879 statute to prosecute anyone for using contraceptives; the professors used this test case as an opportunity for an activist court to &quot;discover&quot; a new right. Similarly, in Bowers v. Hardwick, Georgia had not charged the plaintiff with breaking the sodomy laws. Instead, the case was urged by civil-rights groups hoping for another Griswold-style expansion of the court's role in invalidating dead state laws. After Bowers v. Hardwick, these groups might be more likely to lobby state legislators to remove offensive and unused laws from the books instead of rushing to the courts.    Stanford's Thomas Grey is another Bork opponent who will tell the senators that judges need not be bound by the Constitution. This is the bicentennial of something, but in a law review article entitled &quot;Do We Have an Unwritten Constitution?&quot; Mr. Grey answers yes. &quot;There was an original understanding, both implicit and textually expressed, that unwritten higher law principles had constitutional status,&quot; he writes. The job of the courts is to locate &quot;unwritten but still binding principles of higher law.&quot;    Harvard's Laurence Tribe, who is scheduled to appear today, is another opponent of original intent. Mr. Tribe says original intent can &quot;be used to pave the road to a kind of constitutional hell, an oppressive vision of greed in the corporate board room, jingoism in the White House and government as Big Brother in every bedroom in the land.&quot;    Mr. Tribe will probably be asked about &quot;God Save This Honorable Court,&quot; the book he recently wrote to justify rejecting court nominees who believe in what he calls &quot;the myth of the strict constructionist.&quot; The theme is that senators should ensure that President Reagan cannot alter the balance of the court from the current liberal consensus. Mr. Tribe urges senators to reject nominees on the basis of their &quot;political, judicial and economic philosophies.&quot;    One member of the Senate Judiciary Committee has already pointed to a flaw in that argument. Last year, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) reviewed the book in the Harvard Law Review. He wrote that Mr. Tribe's anti-Reagan &quot;slant prejudices its persuasiveness.&quot; He added -- perhaps as a warning to Mr. Tribe, who is a potential Democratic judicial nominee -- that one &quot;problem with a partisan approach to this advice and consent process is that such an approach engenders political reprisals.&quot;    Several law professors will testify on behalf of Judge Bork, including Paul Bator from the University of Chicago and Yale's Mr. Priest. Another forceful advocate from the academy will be economist Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution, who is scheduled to testify today. Mr. Sowell has written that activist judges have made the law more unpredictable, endangering the rule of law. They have also &quot;imposed adventurous social policies -- policies almost invariably opposed by the general public.&quot;    Mr. Sowell disapproves of the power that activist judges have assumed over so many areas of political and social life. He says that one reason he supports Judge Bork's nomination is that the courts have become &quot;the favorite way of doing an endrun around the democratic process and imposing the ideas of the anointed.&quot;    The liberal critics from academia owe their substantial reputations to making judicial activism legitimate. Judge Bork has now forcefully denied the legitimacy of this method of judging. At stake is much more than points in an intellectual debate. At stake is whether the branch of government charged with the leading role in interpreting the Constitution should still take the document seriously.    ---   Mr. Crovitz, Yale Law '86, is assistant editor of the Journal's editorial page. </TEXT></DOC>
