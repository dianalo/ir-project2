Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, speaking on Israel radio, vowedhis government would make an ``appropriate response ... in duecourse'' to the killing.   Eighteen Arab suspects were detained, the radio said.   Dozens of officers who rushed to the scene after the body wasfound today sealed off the entrances to several neighboring Arabvillages, Etti Elinsky, a spokeswoman at the collective farm, saidin a telephone interview.   Also today, the army closed three elementary and junior highschools in the occupied Gaza Strip, bringing to eight the number ofschools closed since Saturday, Arab reports said.   The closures aim to end participation by Palestinian youths inthe 6{-month uprising in the territories Israel seized in the 1967Middle East war.   On Sunday, Israeli troops shot and wounded a 20-year-oldPalestinian during a clash in the West Bank village of Salim. Theincident followed a weekend of sporadic clashes in which twoPalestinians were killed and 20 wounded.   The farmer's slaying would be the fourth death of an Israelisince the uprising began Dec. 8. At least 210 Palestinians havedied in the rebellion, most by Israeli gunfire, according to U.N.figures.   Mrs. Elinsky said the victim, Eli Cohen, was found at thecollective farm lying near his grape vines with a hole in his headapparently caused by a beating with a heavy steel object.   The farm is about 25 miles south of Jerusalem and borders threeArab villages near the West Bank city of Hebron.   Police spokesman Rafi Levy said police suspected an Arab wasresponsible for the killing but declined to comment further.   Mrs. Elinsky said Cohen never returned home after leaving tospray his grape vines with insecticide Sunday evening. She said hewas found this morning by another farmer.   She said Arabs were also suspected of committing several acts ofvandalism on the farm in the last four months. In one incident,farmers found a black, green, red and white Palestinian flag in afield strewn with uprooted vegetables, Mrs. Elinsky said.   On Saturday, 160 grape vines were destroyed by fire, apparentlyby arsonists, she added.   Israelis have accused Palestinian arsonists of a rash of firesthat have destroyed tens of thousands of acres in the past fewweeks.   ``There was a systematic policy of educating youths to violentactivities,'' an army spokesman said, adding that militaryofficials found ``inflammatory and anti-Semitic material'' in tworaids on the center.   Also today, Israeli prison spokesman Johnny Tester said aPalestinian prisoner from the Gaza Strip was freed on bail aftergiving birth to a boy Friday. The Jerusalem Post said it was thefirst time a security prisoner had ever been released on bail.   The woman, Aisheh Said Odeh Al Kurd, 28, from the town of Rafah,was detained about two months ago on suspicion of taking part in anattempted bombing in a Tel Aviv suburb, as well as in incidents inthe Gaza Strip, the Post said.   In Gaza, Israeli soldiers closed two of Gaza City's largestoutdoor marketplaces this morning and ordered merchants to reopenin the afternoon.   The measure, which affected more than 100 fruit, vegetable andmeat stands, appeared aimed at breaking the obedience ofPalestinian merchants to underground uprising leaders, who haveordered stores shut in the afternoons.   Also in Gaza City today, dozens of Palestinians staged a sit-inin the Red Cross building in solidarity with Arab children involvedin the uprising. The two-hour sit-in was in keeping with the latestunderground leaflet, which called for a day to honor ``PalestinianChildren Martyrs.''</TEXT></DOC>
