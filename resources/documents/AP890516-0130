LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Unless women win more access to family planning,education and employment, the world's population could almosttriple to 14 billion by the year 2100, a U.N. agency said in areport Tuesday.   Too many women remain trapped because of fundamentalistreligions that ``keep women in bondage'' and cultural values thatput men first, said Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of theUnited Nations Population Fund, in launching the 1989 State ofWorld Population Report.   Appealing for a fivefold increase in world spending on familyplanning, the report said: ``The status of women will be crucial indetermining future population growth rates.''   Half the world's women have no access to family planningservices _ mostly those in traditional male-dominated societies orareas far from family planning services, Mrs. Sadik said.   ``Yet, this is precisely the audience we must reach if we are tohave further success in our efforts,'' she said.   She said world population, now 5.2 billion, ``is at a criticaljuncture,'' likely to increase by more than 90 million a year untilthe end of the century and stabilize at 10 billion about a centuryfrom now.   This optimistic projection assumes that fertility in thedeveloping world will drop by one-third in the next 40 years, thereport said.   The report said about 465 million women in the developing world,or 45 percent, use contraceptives: 14 percent in Africa, 50 percentin Asia, and 56 percent in Latin America.   Without China's extensive birth control program, the overall useof contraceptives in the developing world would drop to about 30percent, the report said.   To attain the desired drop in fertility, 58 percent of womenwill have to be using family planning in 2000 and 71 percent _ thepresent level in industrialized countries _ by 2025, it said. Insub-Saharan Africa, those using family planning would have toincrease tenfold.   ``But this will not happen unless more of the world's women aregiven more health care, family planning services, education, andemployment opportunities,'' Mrs. Sadik said.   ``We now have clear-cut, concrete evidence of linkage betweenfemale education, fertility and mortality, between gainfulemployment for women and patterns of family formation, and betweenwomen's participation and the success of population programs andeconomic development,'' she said.   Thirty-one countries in the developing world still havevirtually no family planning facilities, the report said, and 37 ofthe poorest countries have cut health spending by half andeducation by one-fourth in the last four years.   If the family planners failed, the world would have 14 billionpeople by 2100, which ``would create enormous potential forviolence and social upheaval,'' she said.   The Pakistani physician called on societies to end legal andsocial discrimination against women, increase their access toleadership positions, and teach at all levels ``that women and menare equal in value.''   Asked whether religious fundamentalism was hampering women andfamily planning, she replied: ``All these movements seem to bedesigned to somehow keep women in bondage.''   She accused religious leaders of being on ``a power-ego thing... They're reinforcing their authority. It's like all religiousleaders ... who do they talk to? They talk to the poor and theilliterate and those are the only groups they can really sway.   ``All religious movements look at the woman as the one whoshould cater to and serve the family, never the other gender,'' shesaid.   She criticized the United States for halting its contribution tothe Fund in 1986. The Reagan administration contended the agency'spolicies promoted coercive abortion but Mrs. Sadik said the reasonswere political and expressed hope the Bush administration wouldresume the U.S. contribution.   The U.N. Population Fund urged governments to earmark 1 percentof gross national product for family planning. It asked majordonors to increase assistance for family planning programs fivefoldto $2.5 billion a year.   ``This could also save 3 million women's lives by the year 2000,as fewer poor women would die from complications from pregnancy,childbirth and illegal abortion,'' Mrs. Sadik said.</TEXT></DOC>
