 But between Alton, IL, and St. Louis its characterchanges markedly, for here its shining waters mingle with those of the BigMuddy-the silt-laden, 2300-mile-long Missouri.andP;  Although the resultant streamstill bears the majestic name &quot;Mississippi&quot; as it follows its meanderingcourse to the Gulf of Mexico, it's quite a different river than it would havebeen had the pristine Mississippi been spared this encounter.andM;Long-time readers of this column should by now be aware that I'll go toshameless lengths to illustrate aspects of the laws affecting intellectualproperty-and yes, that's what I'm up to now.andP;  For it's in this area oflaw-the attempt to protect intellectual property-that we find some of themost troublesome minglings of the disparate strands in our Americanconstitutional and legal fabric.andM;Specifically, let's consider the copyright laws, and a couple of points wherethey bump into other principles of US law.andP;  Just as the Missouri muddies theMississippi, so these encounters influence the effective shape and texture ofcopyright law.andM;To quote the Justices of the Supreme Court, the doctrine of fair use has beencalled &quot;the most troublesome in the whole law of copyright&quot;.andP;  Anunderstatement indeed, yet the basic notion behind fair use can be statedsimply-that is, that the &quot;exclusive Right&quot; granted under the Constitution tocopyright holders is not-and cannot be-absolute.andP;  This is because otherConstitutional provisions, as well public-policy imperatives, dictate thatunder certain circumstances, people other than the originators must have theright to make at least limited use of protected works.andM;Fair use isn't referred to explicitly in the Constitution, and the doctrineis not itself a creation of Congress.andP;  It developed gradually as the courtscarved out exceptions to the &quot;exclusive right&quot; concept on a case-by-casebasis.andP;  Later, when Congress wrote the copyright law that went into effectJanuary 1, 1978, it attempted to pull together all the various fair-useexceptions handed down by the courts over the years and codify them as rules.andO;One result was Section 107, which tells us that the fair use of a copyrightedwork.andP;  .  .  for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting,teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, orresearch, is not an infringement of copyright.andM;In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is afair use the factors to be considered shall include:andM;(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of acommercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;andM;(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;andM;(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to thecopyrighted work as a whole, andandM;(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of thecopyrighted work.andM;If by enacting Section 107 Congress had hoped to dispel the confusionregarding fair use, it did not succeed, as we'll see shortly.andP;  It was perhapsin anticipation of a need for further clarification that Congress enactedadditional sections that apply to specific fair-use situations.andP;  Thus,Section 108 provides detailed instructions for reproduction of copyrightedmaterial on the part of libraries and archives; Section 109 permits the ownerof a copy of a book or recording to sell or dispose of it (this is known asthe first copy doctrine) ; Section 1 1 0 covers performances or showings ofcopyrighted works by non-profit institutions; Section 1 1 1 regulatestransmissions by cable systems; and on and on it goes.andM;Initially, the 1978 law was largely silent with respect to computing.andO;Congress took a stab at rectifying this situation in 1980 when it rewroteSection 117 to provide some fair-use guidelines for the industry-.andM;.. it is not an infringement for theandM;owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the making ofanother copy or adaptation of that computer program provided:andM;(1) that such new coPY or adaptation is created as an essential step in theutilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that itis used in no other manner, orandM;(2) that such new copy or adaptation is for archival purposes only and thatall archival copies are destroyed in the event that continued possession ofthe computer program should cease to be rightfulandM;Any exact copies prepared in accordance with the provisions of this sectionmay be leased, sold, or otherwise transferred, along with the copy from whichsuch copies were prepared, only as part of the lease, sale or other transferof all rights in the program.andP;  Adaptations so prepared may be transferredonly with the authorization of the copyright owner.andM;Readers should note that Section 1 17 grants permission for copying only tothe owner of a copy of a program.andP;  Even though the overall content of thesection suggests that the failure to include licensees may have beenunintentional, a prudent licensee should see that authorization to makenecessary copies is provided in the licensing agreement.andM;Well now, this perusal of the statutes has answered all of your questionsregarding fair use, right?andM;Of course not.andP;  If it were merely a matter of scanning the general criteriaset out in Section 107, the courts wouldn't have fair-use cases stacked uplike cordwood.andP;  Not only are the four factors which Congress designated asthose &quot;to be considered&quot; imprecise, but the statute doesn't assign them anyrelative weight.andP;  Moreover, this list of factors is expressly not madeall-inclusive.andM;The uncertainty is compounded, as I suggested earlier, by the potentialimpact of doctrines external to copyright law.andP;  Prominent among these is theFirst Amendment to the Constitution, which has recently sparked a flurry ofactivity in the courts with respect to fair-use controversies.andM;At first blush, the First Amendment's dictate that &quot;Congress shall make nolaw ...andP;  abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press&quot; would appear tofly in the face of the Constitution's Article 1, Section 8, which grantsCongress the authority to secure to authors an exclusive right to theirwritings.andP;  The legal argument could in fact be made that since the FirstAmendment was adopted after the original Constitution, the Amendment ought toprevail in case of any conflict.andP;  However, that has not been thedetermination in copyright cases where, in the view of a large segment of theliterary world, the First Amendment has been taking a bit of a pasting.andM;As far back as George Washington's letters, the principle o copyright law hasbeen that the author of a letter retains own of the copyright on it.andP;  Lately,however, controversy over this principle has been renewed by a 2nd CircuitCourt of Appeals holding and the Supreme Court's subsequent refusal to hearan appeal from this decision.andM;In an unflattering biography of Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard,author Russell Miller quoted from Hubbard's unpublished letters and diaries,having obtained much of the material from the government's files under theFreedom of information Act.andP;  Although the Court of Appeals declined to enjoindistribution of Miller's book on the basis that there had been an excessivedelay in bringing legal action, its determination that copyright infringementhad occurred now constitutes a formidable legal precedent.andM;What appears to be happening is that the Supreme Court-and, now, the Courtsof Appeals-is giving increasing emphasis to the first of the four factors setout in Section 107-namely, whether the copyrighted material is used forcommercial purposes.andP;  When the Supreme Court decided Sony Corp. vs.andO;Universal Studios in 1984, the Court majority stated,andM;.. every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively an unfairexploitation of the monopoly privilege that belongs to the owner of thecopyright....andM;Nevertheless, the Justices relied upon the fourth factor-the effect thepotential market-to conclude that home VCR taping of telecasts did notconstitute copyright infringement.andM;The following year, in a case involving publication of portions of PresidentFord's forthcoming memoirs by The Nation, the Supreme Court reached anopposite conclusion, rejecting the magazine's express claim of FirstAmendment protection.andP;  The Court's majority emphasized that commercial asopposed to non-profit publication &quot;tends to weigh against a finding of fairuse&quot;, and then repeated the statement it had made in Sony Corp. vs.andO;Universal Studios.andP;  In 1987, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals blockedpublication of a biography of writer J. D. Salinger, on the ground that hisunpublished-though publicly accessible-letters had been quoted (the Ford andSalinger decisions were covered more fully in Vol.andP;  6, No.andP;  3.).andM;Now, the recent ruling from the same 2nd Circuit in the Hubbard case haswriters and publishers running for cover.andP;  Biographies of authors RichardWright, Malcolm X, Saul Bellow, and William Faulkner have been rewritten,withdrawn or enjoined.andP;  The prospect that in the future it may be virtuallyimpossible to write anything but an &quot;authorized&quot; biography of a publicfigure-its contents carefully sanitized through control of copyrighteddocuments-is disquieting.andP;  What, after all, would we really know today of thelives of the famous Bronte siblings-living in their isolation at the edge ofthe Yorkshire moors-had Charlotte's wishes that her letters be destroyed notbeen disregarded by her friend Elien Nussey?andM;Although the First Amendment is currently getting the worst of its encounterwith the copyright laws, for the Eleventh Amendment it's a different story.andO;This provision specifies that the power of the federal courts does not extendto lawsuits brought against a state by citizens of another state or of aforeign country.andP;  It was later interpreted by the courts as also applying tosuits against a state by one of its own citizens.andP;  Accordingly, in 1988 the9th Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the Eleventh Amendment preventedBV Engineering Professional Software from maintaining acopyright-infringement lawsuit against the University of California, LosAngeles.andP;  The reason: the 1978 copyright law requires that infringement suitsbe brought in the federal courts, and makes no provision of a venue forinfringement actions against the states or their agencies.andP;  This ruling leftBV Engineering no recourse for what it claimed was illegal copying of sevenof its programs on the part of UCLA, and last year the Supreme Court turneddown the company's appeal.andM;Actually, Section 107 of the copyright law does appear to allow a certainamount of leeway for teaching, scholarship, or research, as long as theseactivities are conducted in connection with nonprofit educational purposes&quot;.andO;But there's no general exemption from the copyright laws for educationalinstitutions, as a group at Vanderbilt University learned as a result ofbeing the losing defendants in SAS Institute Inc. vs.andP;  S andamp; H Computer SystemsInc. (see Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  4 for a discussion of this case) .andM;It's conceivable that an old legal distinction between &quot;governmental&quot; and&quot;proprietary&quot; activities could be adapted to cover the university situation.andO;This concept was at one time frequently used to determine whether or not astate could claim immunity from suit, but with the modern erosion of theonce-mighty doctrine of state sovereign immunity, it hasn't been used much oflate.andP;  Still, a similar distinction might be helpful in delineatingpermissable areas of fair use in educational settings-for example, when auniversity markets derivative software or publications, this would beconsidered proprietary, not educational, in purpose.andM;Even though institutions such as state universities may have slipped off thehook-momentarily, at least-other in-house users of copyrighted materials arebeginning to feel the heat.andP;  The Copyright Clearance Center of Salem, MA,operating as a sort of ASCAP for authors and publishers, is starting to rakein substantial sums as fees for the privilege of photocopying protectedpublications in other circumstances.andP;  Companies now playing ball with theCenter include such biggies as ATandamp;T, Amoco Corp., Dow Chemical Co., andRockwell International Corp. Initially most of the money was collected inconnection with the reproduction of articles from scientific journals, but inthe recent past the list has expanded to include articles from business andcomputing publications.andP;  Perhaps it's something to mull over the next timeyou feel like photocopying &quot;C Advisor&quot;, or possibly even &quot;Rules of the Game&quot;.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law He also has served as an</TEXT></DOC>
