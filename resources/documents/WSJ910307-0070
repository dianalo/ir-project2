After years serving astrainer and hotelier for the world's leading terrorists,after the 1982 leveling of the Sunni city of Hama, and afterthe recent subjugation of Lebanon, Mr. Assad decided to throwin with the country that controls the Tomahawks and Stealthairplanes. Now he wants to talk to Jim Baker about a role inrebuilding a better Middle East. We have a better idea forMr. Assad: Deliver Terry Anderson to freedom.   Terry Anderson is the Associated Press reporter who waskidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985. Terry Anderson, ofcourse, is not alone. Five other Americans also live ashostages in Lebanon (assuming none has been tortured to deathlike former CIA officer William Buckley), along with TerryWaite and three other Britons, two Germans and an Italian.</LP><TEXT>   The hostages' nominal captors, the Iranian-backedHezbollah, said in Beirut yesterday it will not &quot;help&quot; inrelease of the hostages. But Hezbollah does not run Lebanon;Mr. Assad took advantage of the Gulf war to wipe out the lastresistance to his military control there. As proprietor ofthe territory, it is up to him to ensure the safety of U.S.citizens and other foreign nationals. Now is the time forHafez Assad, the lord of Lebanon, to revisit the kidnappers'cells and clean them out.   In the wake of the Iraq war, even the pretext for holdingthese hostages has vanished (unless, of course, Mr. Assadplans to use them as a bargaining chip in his discussionswith Secretary Baker). In recent years, the hostages'kidnappers argued that they'd be released if the Kuwaitgovernment freed 15 Shiite terrorists imprisoned for carbombings there. But those 15 Shiites fled jail when theIraqis overran Kuwait City.   For years we have been expected to believe that thehostages were pawns in a complex political calculus involvingLebanese Shiites, Iranian mullahs, Palestinians, the Syrians,and various feuding clans. But all that was the status quo ina byzantine world dominated by such nonproductivepersonalities as Ayatollah Khomeini, Yasser Arafat and SaddamHussein. Today, Khomeini is dead, Arafat is discredited andSaddam is ruined. A new Middle Eastern order in the Arabworld is about to develop, whose primary regional actors arelikely to be the Saudis, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and TurgutOzal of Turkey.   Beyond them, there is another tier of claimants. Iran andits president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, want to participate in theprocess. Mr. Assad already thinks he's in the game. And asalways there is something called &quot;the Palestinian issue.&quot; Acase can be made, on various grounds, that all three of theseought to be party in some fashion to the evolving order. Buthow can any of them be treated as credible partners so longas Terry Anderson and the others languish in southernLebanon, their presence serving as a monument to terror andpolitical nihilism -- the same destructive values that aWestern-Arab coalition just fought to defeat?   Even now, the much wept-over Palestinians sit in Lebanonfiring Katyusha rockets into Israel. Lebanon's Syrian-backedpresident, Elias Hrawi, said of the Palestinians this week,&quot;Those we had received with open arms and treated as equalsto the Lebanese are the ones spreading trouble in the south.They must realize that the liberation of their homelandcannot be attained by firing Katyushas from our land.&quot;   The Assads and Rafsanjanis of the Middle East ought totake those words to heart. This war wasn't fought to see theresumption of politics-by-hostage, to let the Middle Eastslip back into its familiar neuroses. If indeed there is anyprospect now of settling such matters as the tragedies ofLebanon or the Palestinians, men such as Hafez Assad willhave to be seen ending the launching of Katyusha rockets,ensuring that serious Palestinian politicians aren't murderedby the PLO and letting Terry Anderson and his colleagues gohome. And surely if President Bush's &quot;new world order&quot; meansanything at all, it ought to mean that the country thatcontrols the Tomahawks and the Stealth airplanes will nothesitate to use its new influence to ensure the safety of itscitizens in the trouble spots of the world.</TEXT></DOC>
