Balint.andP;  GFDL and NMCeach will buy about 150 workstations from the procurement.andM;&quot;What we need now is funding for the rest of ERL's labs,&quot; Welsh said.andM;Balint added, &quot;It is clear from the power of the desktop today, and thegrowth we are going to see in the 1990s, that that particular platform isgoing to be far and away the most effective for our scientists.&quot;andM;He predicted high-end workstations by 1997 will have the capability of apresent Cray Y-MP supercomputer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
