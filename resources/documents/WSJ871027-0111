The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration charged the Androscoggin mill with 37 violations of federal standards, including 34 willful violations. The agency defines willful violations as involving an employer's knowledge that it is violating federal rules or is aware that a hazardous condition exists and makes no reasonable effort to correct it.    &quot;The company's disregard for employee protection from the effects of exposure to toxic gases in the pulp mill, the frequency of leaks and the exposure of 31 employees on a regular basis to these toxic gases compels us to recommend the strongest possible enforcement response,&quot; said Frank White, deputy assistant secretary of labor for OSHA.    International Paper has 15 days to contest the citations and proposed penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.    In Purchase, N.Y., a spokeswoman for International Paper said the company will &quot;review OSHA's citations and most probably contest.&quot;    Among the alleged violations, OSHA said the company allowed workers to be exposed to unknown concentrations of chlorine, chlorine dioxide and hydrogen sulfide without respiratory protection, or with respirators that weren't approved for protection against those toxic gases.    The mill also failed to develop procedures for safe use of the respirators, to positively identify pipelines carrying hazardous substances, to provide workers with information on hazardous chemicals in their work areas or to properly lock out chemical lines during maintenance, OSHA said. </TEXT></DOC>
