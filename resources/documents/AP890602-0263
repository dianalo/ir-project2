Tenneco said the incident involved about 1.17 billion cubic feetof gas over about a nine-month period ending Feb. 3, 1987.   ``This was an isolated incident and occurred without authorityor the knowledge of Tenneco's executive management,'' spokesman LewBullion said.   ``The flaring was in clear violation of the company's corporatepolicy, which is to comply with all rules and regulations governingits oil and gas operations. There were immediate corrective actionstaken to halt the loss of gas and appropriate disciplinary measureswere taken,'' he said.   Bullion said he did not know how many people were involved,describing it only as ``a small group.''   ``We are proud of our record and remain committed to a corporatepolicy that mandates compliance with the letter as well as thespirit of the rules and regulations governing our businesses,''J.L. Ketelsen, Tenneco chairman, said.   ``Our investigation shows Tenneco executive management in no waycondoned this,'' Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein saidFriday. ``But what occurred was wrong. Tenneco management has beencooperative ...''   Goldstein said the $5 million fine, delivered Friday by Tennecoto federal Minerals Management Service officials in New Orleans,might not be the end of the matter.   ``In our negotiations, there is ongoing dispute between thedepartment and Tenneco as to the value of the gas,'' he said. ``Thesecretary wanted to make sure we preserved the right to collectmore royalties.''   Tenneco estimated royalties lost because of the destruction ofgas at $115,000.   Tenneco last year sold its oil and gas operations for more than$7 billion. The incident cited by the Interior Department occurredbetween May 1986 and February 1987 at a Gulf of Mexico drillingplatform.   Interior officials said the gas was destroyed by ``flaring,'' aprocess that burns off unwanted gas. Tenneco said the actionresulted in no health, safety or environmental damage.   According to the department's inspector general's office,Tenneco burned off the gas because prices were too low to make itprofitable to bring it onshore.   The company's lease agreement with the government, however, madeTenneco responsible for paying royalties on all gas and oil,regardless of whether it was sold. Government officials saidTenneco tried to avoid the payments by filing false production androyalty reports and by disconnecting a gas meter.   Two technicians from the Minerals Management Service, on aninspection tour of a Tenneco offshore platform, discovered theproblem when they saw bubbling in the water _ a sign of gas beingvented.   Under terms of the accord, which has been in negotiation formonths, Tenneco will pay the fine in exchange for the government'sagreement not to seek criminal prosecution, civil penalties orcancel the company's lease.</TEXT></DOC>
