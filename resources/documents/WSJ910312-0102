The Italian bank consented to the cease-and-desist order10 days after three former employees of BNL's Atlanta branchwere charged with conspiracy and fraud in the issuance ofmore than $4 billion in credit to Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   Under the order, Rome-based BNL agreed to pursue a specialmanagement plan and to comply with U.S. financialrecord-keeping and reporting rules. Among other things, thebank has prepared a compliance program to ensure that itsU.S. branches are adequately supervised and don't violatestate and federal banking laws.   &quot;BNL is pleased to have worked out a mutually satisfactorysettlement . . . concerning problems which resulted from afailure of previous management of the Atlanta agency toproperly report various transactions to the Federal ReserveBoard,&quot; the Italian government-owned bank said in a statementyesterday.   Federal prosecutors said that former officers of theAtlanta branch kept a secret set of &quot;gray books&quot; to hidescores of unauthorized transactions from bank regulators andBNL auditors.   Of more than $4 billion in credit issued to Iraq, nearly$1.9 billion in loans were guaranteed by the AgricultureDepartment under its commodity export credit programs. WithIraq currently in default, the government stands to lose $347million on those loans. Some of the BNL credit is believed tohave paid for Iraqi purchases of technology essential toSaddam Hussein's military buildup.   A 347-count indictment, returned by a federal grand juryin Atlanta, contended that Atlanta branch employees conspiredto defraud BNL by lending money without Rome's authorization.The indictment named 10 defendants, including former branchmanager Christopher Drogoul and four Iraqi officials.   The parent bank wasn't charged with any wrongdoing, butItalian authorities are investigating whether BNL's topmanagement was negligent in failing to discover theunauthorized activities in Atlanta. BNL's chairman andgeneral manager have resigned over the scandal, which becamepublic in August 1989, when federal agents who were acting ona tip raided the Atlanta branch office.</TEXT></DOC>
