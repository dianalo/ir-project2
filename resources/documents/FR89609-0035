Where conflict or contradiction occurs between Federalregulation and State law or regulation, Federal regulation will take precedenceover the State law or regulation. Access to the NPS preserves by aircraftfor sport hunting and other purposes is also allowed. While the State hasa similar regulation in place for most big game species, commonly referredto as the same-day-airborne regulation, some big game wildlife speciesand some fur animals are exempted. This proposed Federal rulemaking will: 1. Prohibit the same-day-airborne hunting of wolves; 2. Satisfy the legal mandate to provide for subsistence and sport huntingopportunities in the NPS preserves; 3. Allow NPS to manage NPS preserves for the purposes for which they wereestablished by Congress; and, 4.

This act, among other things, identifiedand set aside certain areas of Federal land in Alaska as being of a highpublic interest, the overall purpose being ``to preserve for the benefit,use, education, and inspiration of present and future generations certainlands and waters in the State of Alaska'' (section 101). These ``publicinterest'' lands include units designated as national parks, monuments,and preserves. While sport hunting is not allowed in national parks, itis allowed in the national preserves. However, in section 1313 of the lawand in legislative history, Congress made it clear that the preserve lands``qualify in every regard as National Parks,'' while recognizing, ``insome instances, that the taking of wildlife under appropriate regulationis consistent with the maintenance of the natural values of lands whichwe otherwise would unhesitatingly designate as National Parks.'' (CongressionalRecord, House, November 12, 1980; H10549.)   The intent of Congress to allow sport hunting under ``appropriate regulation''is reflected in this proposed rulemaking, and in existing NPS regulationscodified in Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations (36 CFR). 35 CFR2.2 adopts ``Nonconflicting State laws'' as a part of Federal hunting lawsand regulations for all park units of the National Park System in whichhunting is authorized by law. In andSection;13.21, which is specific to Alaska,applicable State and Federal law relative to hunting and trapping is also``adopted and made a part of these regulations.'' This proposed rulemakingdoes not change this adoption of non-conflicting State laws and regulations,and in fact duplicates some of the language of existing State regulations. An Alaska State Statute, 5 ACC 92.085(4), has since 1975 prohibited thetaking of big game species (except for deer in recent years) by ``a personwho has been airborne * * * until after 3:00 a.m. following the day inwhich the flying occurred * * *''. The State defines ``big game'' as ``blackbear, brown and grizzly bear, bison, caribou, Sitka black-tail deer, elk,mountain goat, moose, musk oxen, Dall sheep, wolf and wolverine.'' Thissame-day-airborne regulation is accepted among lawful hunters and allowsfor adequate access to wildlife resources, while a the same time preventingthe abuses that could result from hunters being able to spot and ``drive''or ``track'' wildlife from the air and then to land immediately and takesuch wildlife. Recently, an amendment to this State Statute makes an exceptionfor wolves under the State's big game classification in certain State gamemanagement units which include NPS preserves. This exception allows huntersin these units to land an aircraft and immediately take a wolf as a biggame animal under the State's hunting regulations. This exception is commonlyreferred to as land-and-shoot hunting or same-day-airborne hunting. Therehave also been recent proposals presented to the Alaska Board of Game fromsome parties to make further exceptions to the ``same-day-airborne'' regulationsfor other species of wildlife. The proposed Federal regulation will prohibitsame-day-airborne hunting for wolves in all NPS preserve units in Alaska,regardless of how State regulations may change in the future. The proposedrule will not, however, prohibit a trapper from using a firearm to dispatchan animal legally caught in a trap or snare on the same day in which flyingoccurred.  The NPS has long been recognized for its protection of esthetic, recreational,as well as biological and other scientific and resource values in parkareas. ANILCA does not change this. Congress recognized that managementvalues differ between agencies when it stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * it is the intent of Congress that certain traditional NationalPark Service management values be maintained * * * the National Park Systemconcept requires implementation of management policies which strive tomaintain the natural abundance, behavior, diversity and ecological integrityof native animals as part of their ecosystem, and that concept should bemaintained * * *. It is expected that the National Park Service will takeappropriate steps when necessary to insure that consumptive uses of fishand wildlife populations within National Park System units not be allowedto adversely disrupt the natural balance which has been maintained forthousands of years. Congressional Record H10541, (November 12, 1980).</ITAG>In section 101 of ANILCA, Congress clearly stated its intent that the conservationsystem units were set aside ``* * * to provide for the maintenance of soundpopulations of, and habitat for, wildlife species of inestimable valueto the citizens of Alaska and the Nation, including those species dependenton vast relatively undeveloped areas; * * * to protect the resources relatedto subsistence needs; * * * and to preserve wilderness resources valuesand related recreational opportunities including * * * sport hunting ** *''. It is consistent with both NPS management values and Congressionalintent, to manage for quality visitor use experiences, including hunting,in the NPS preserves in Alaska. Allowing same-day-airborne hunting in NPSpreserves is inconsistent with Congressional intent and NPS managementvalues. The National Park Service is responsible for managing hunting activitiesin park areas to assure a high standard of quality while not unnecessarilyinterfering with the State of Alaska's ability to make wildlife resourceallocations in the form of hunting seasons and bag limits. ANILCA, statesthat the national preserves are to be managed in exactly the same manneras national parks, except that sport hunting, subsistence uses and trappingshall be allowed. The National Park Service was charged with assuring thatthe taking of fish and wildlife is consistent with preserving the naturaland other values of the park system. Congress clearly stated its intentin how the preserves should be managed when it stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The standard to be met in regulating the taking of fish and wildlife,and trapping, it that the preeminent natural values of the Part Systemshall be protected in perpetuity, and shall not be jeopardized by humanuses. These are very special lands, and this standard must be set veryhigh: the objective for Park System lands must always be to maintain thehealth of the ecosystem, and the yield of fish and wildlife for huntigand trapping must be consistent with this requirement. Congressional RecordH10549, (November 12, 1980)</ITAG>Public comment received by the NPS strongly indicates the feeling thatsport hunting does not include the use of aircraft for seeking out wildlifefrom the air, and then landing and immediately taking such wildlife; nordoes it include selectivity in regulations to impose increased pressureson predator species.In the nation's NPS preserves in Alaska, the prohibition of same-day-airbornehunting of wolves will be consistent with the ``fair chase'' philosophyof hunting. State regulations previously eliminated same-day-airborne huntingfor most species. It is the intent and purpose of this proposed regulationto establish a similar Federal prohibition against same-day-airborne huntingof wolves in all NPS preserves in Alaska.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Problem of Enforcement</ITAG>There is evidence to indicate a correlation between legalization of same-day-airbornehunting and its abuse by associated illegal actions. In one incident inMarch of 1988, four wolves were illegally killed in and near Denali NationalPark and Preserve. Evidence at two kill sites indicated that the animalswere run nearly to the point of exhaustion by aircraft before being killed.While this action is illegal, it illustrates and reinforces a common perceptionthat land-and-shoot hunting places a hunter, and in particular a wolf hunter,too close to the threshold of violating the Federal Airborne Hunting Act,as well as existing State law, both of which prohibit the harassing ofwildlife with aircraft.Further evidence of harassing of wolves with aircraft can be found in arecent article in the Journal of Wildlife Management, which surveys thehistory of wolf predation on the Nelchina caribou herd (``Wolf Predationon Caribou: The Nelchina Herd Case History''; Bergerud, A.T., Ballard,W.B.; Journal of Wildlife Management, 1988; 52(2); p. 352). In explaininga discrepancy in the statistics for 1972 through 1976, which showed largernumbers of caribou than expected based on a similar high wolf count, theauthors state that, ``Our explanations for the higher-than-predicted values,based on wolf abundance, is that intense aerial hunting of wolves * * *resumed after 1967. We believe that wolves subjected to harassment fromaerial hunters learn to avoid the high alpine area where caribou calve.''While the aerial hunting referred to here is the ``shoot-and-land'' method,shooting from the air while still flying, it is a difficult problem toshow whether a hunter has hunted and shot from the air, or harassed ananimal to the point of exhaustion then landed and shot. Harassment is difficultto prove in any case. It becomes virtually impossible when the law allowsfor same-day-airborne hunting, which permits methods that are difficultto distinguish from harassment.Other enforcement problems also arise when certain species are made exceptionsto the general regulation. For example, while there may be strong evidenceavailable to an enforcement officer that a hunter was attempting to takecaribou or another species protected by the same-day-airborne regulation,it becomes easy for the hunter under suspicion to claim that he was flyingand hunting for wolf instead. Again, the discrepancy in the law placesa hunter too close to the threshold of illegal activity. Such activities do not reflect the intent of Congress in establishing thepreserves. The opportunities for abuse inherent in same-day-airborne orland-and-shoot hunting cross a line of conservation management preceptsand break with the established preservation ethic for which the NPS isknown. Aircraft provide a means by which animals can be efficiently detectedand quickly killed in relatively large numbers, as demonstrated by recentlyobtained State sealing records for wolf pelts taken in central Alaska.This ``efficiency'' is easily abused, and can quickly do serious damage.This rulemaking does not unduly restrict aircraft access for sport huntingpurposes when the concept of fair chase is maintained, when law enforcementproblems are not allowed to continue or be created, and when wildlife arenot harassed in any way. Other sport hunted animals that may be taken inthe national preserves, such as waterfowl, ptarmigan and mammals that can'tgenerally be spotted from the air, are not affected by this rulemakingbecause the airborne hunter does not have an unfair advantage where theyare concerned.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Management Responsibilities</ITAG>The ANILCA provision that addresses hunting in NPS preserves was made withspecific Congressional intent that there be no other departure from protection,in the preserves, of park resources and values. Hunting and trapping activitieswere intended by Congress to be limited and compatible, ``of types andintensities that will not interfere with'' the broader purposes for whichthe preserves were set aside. To allow a system of land-and-shoot hunting,in lieu of encouraging quality hunting and trapping experiences in suchareas, would be in conflict with purposes for which preserves were setaside.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effects of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>This proposed rule will prohibit same-day-airborne, land-and-shoot, huntingfor sport and subsistence purposes by amending 36 CFR 13.21 to add a same-day-airborneprohibition of hunting wolves. Sport and subsistence hunters would continueto be able to hunt within the preserves under non-conflicting State andFederal laws. This will include being able to fly into a preserve and beginhunting the next day, a procedure that is currently legal and practicedby hunters. This proposed rulemaking will provide protection for wolvesagainst same-day-airborne hunting in NPS preserves. This rule will applyto all hunters who use aircraft within the preserves.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Participation</ITAG>The policy of the National Park Service is, whenever practicable, to affordthe public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Accordingly,interested persons may submit written comments regarding this proposedrule to the address noted at the beginning of this rulemaking. In addition,a schedule of public hearings to be held in the areas affected and otherappropriate locations will be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at a later date which will provide for publiccomment on the proposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The primary authors of this regulation are Lou Waller, Tony Sisto, andSteve Shackleton of the NPS Alaska Regional Office.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rulemaking does not contain information collection requirements thatrequire approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Compliance With Other Laws</ITAG>The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 (February 19, 1981), 46 FR 13193,and certifies that this document will not have a significant economic effecton a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The economic effects of this rulemaking are local innature and negligible in scope. The National Park Service has determinedthat this rulemaking will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment, health, and safety because it is not expectedto:(a) Change public hunting habits to the extent of adversely affecting wildlifeor other natural ecosystems;(b) Introduce noncompatible uses which might compromise the nature andcharacteristics of the area, or cause physical damage to it;(c) Conflict with adjacent ownerships or land uses;(d) Cause a nuisance to adjacent owners or occupants; or(e) Affect the hunting population in general.Based on this determination, this proposed rulemaking is categoricallyexcluded from the procedural requirements of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA) by Departmental regulations in 516 DM 6, (49 FR 21428).As such, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental ImpactStatement has been prepared.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 13</ITAG>Aircraft, Alaska, National parks, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,Traffic regulations.In consideration of the foregoing, it is proposed to amend 36 CFR ChapterI, Part 13, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 13_NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM UNITS IN ALASKA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_[Amended]</ITAG>1.
