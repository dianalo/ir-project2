Today the Italy beloved by poets, authors and artists hides muchof its legendary beauty in a pall of smog, acres of concrete andmillions of tons of industrial waste and urban garbage. Its watersare becoming poisoned, its landscape scarred, its forests witheredby acid rain.   Ecologists see the Lambro as one symptom of Italy's allergicreaction to its own 20th century. They say its fetid banks are aresult of the feverish postwar economic expansion.   Chemical wastes and agricultural runoff contaminate the Lambroas it flows like a sewer through Italy's industrial heartland, fromnear Lake Como past Milan to just west of Piacenza where it emptiesinto the Po.   The Po, the country's longest and most polluted river, windsthrough some of Italy's most fertile farmland before it spills itstoxins into the increasingly endangered Adriatic Sea.   ``The Lambro is responsible for 30 percent of the totalpollution in the Po,'' said Gianfranco Mascazzini, an environmentalofficial with Lombardy's regional government. ``So the pollution isnot only a problem because of what it does in Lombardy, but alsobecause of what it does to the Po and the Adriatic.''   Still, he noted, the pollution is seeping into Lombardy's soiland beginning to contaminate the aquifier that supplies 90 percentof Milan's drinking water.   A year ago the government approved a five-year, $3.55billion-project to clean the air, soil and water around the Lambro.It hailed the plan as a model, one that could lead to $22 billionin additional spending if extended to the rest of Italy.   The work has not begun.   It has been stalled primarily by political squabbling common atall layers of Italian government. Various local governments andprivate industry have fought over their share of the financing andcontrol of the project.   Environmental groups maintain the plan is just another temporaryremedy doomed to fail because it will not do enough to fight thesources of pollution.   Mario Zerbini, a spokesman for the environmental Greens Party,and Michele Mauri, a World Wildlife Fund ecologist, contend thegovernment is too strongly allied with big business, lacks thepolitical will to confront long-term problems and reacts only toemergencies, such as the current algae invasion along Adriaticcoastal resorts.   A recent Ministry of the Environment report noted that Italy hasonly the capacity to legally dispose of about 30 percent of the97.4 million tons of waste it produces each year, including 3.8million tons considered toxic or dangerous.   The report said half the 1,600 water purification plants incities with a total population of 23 million don't work. It addedthat 2 million people in other cities drink water tainted withherbicides and pesticides.   The ministry said at least half the trees in Italian forestssuffer damage from acid rain. In 1987 alone, it said, Italy coughed380,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, 2percent of the Earth's emissions of the gas that is considered amajor contributor to the ``Greenhouse Effect,'' or warming of theplanet.   ``Italy was relatively slow to come to awareness about itsevironmental problems,'' said Christopher Flavin, a vice presidentwith the Worldwatch Institute in Washington, D.C.   ``Compared to northern Europe the air and water quality is worse... and Italy has a lot more toxic wastes. It is a result of itslagging policies,'' Flavin said in a telephone interview.   Environment Minister Giorgio Ruffolo said earlier this year thatthe government hopes to reduce pollution by 35 percent to 40percent over five years. And Mascazzini, the Lombardy environmentalofficial, argues the Lambro plan is a new beginning toward that end.   ``We agree that it is no longer possible to arrive atconclusive, effective environmental results by confronting theproblems a piece at a time,'' Mascazzini said. ``The Lambro plan isan attempt to better organize the realization of so many things, somany projects.''   Its intent is to restore the land area between the Lambro,Seveso and Olona rivers. It would build five new water purificationplants and enlarge 40 others, construct new sewer networks, pumpingstations and waste treatment plants.   The plan also would invest millions of dollars to clean the air,muffle the noise, build new parks and nature reserves and addsafeguards to high-risk industries in densely populated areas.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs Aug. 9</NOTE></DOC>
