The Asian elephant is already classed as an endangered speciesunder U.S. law. The African kind is considered only as threatened.Upgrading its status would in effect cut off U.S. imports of ivory,said Craig Van Note, who heads Monitor, an association of 32 groups.   ``We think the president will be personally interested; he's anoutdoorsman,'' Van Note said. ``We know Secretary of State (JamesA.) Baker has taken a personal interest.''   A formal 39-page petition was prepared for presentation to thenew secretary of the interior, Manuel J. Lujan Jr.   The coalition said there were 1.3 million elephants in Africa in1981, but are fewer than 500,000 now.   ``Experts have predicted that the African elephant may becomevirtually extinct in as little as 10 years unless ivory poaching isstopped,'' the Humane Society of the United States said in astatement.   ``Africa's remaining elephants cannot wait,'' the petition said.   One major conservation group that did not join in the peititonwas the World Wildlife Fund.   Curtis Bohlen, its senior vice president, said African countrieswould find it offensive if the United States banned all imports.   ``We don't think it's the best way to solve the problem,'' hesaid in a telephone interview. ``We only import 10 percent of theivory.''   A much larger proportion is imported into Japan and stays there,he added. But he said Japan's imports have dropped and itsgovernment is taking drastic new measures to import only legal ivory.   Bohlen said he favored a trial period for a U.S. law that wentinto effect last October, which provides for a halt of ivory importsfrom any country not trying to control the illegal slaughter ofelephants. He said world trade has dropped to 80 tons a year from anan average of 400 to 600 tons.</TEXT></DOC>
