(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Where Did I Stash That Worksheet?andM;The longer you work with worksheets, the more applications you are likely tobuild and use.andP;  Finding the worksheet you want among the many you've createdis difficult when you must search through a list of cryptic file names eachtime you want to retrieve a file.andP;  In 1-2-3 after pressing slash andselecting File Retrieve, you can press the NAME key to view an expanded listof the worksheet files in your current directory.andP;  To get the same results inSymphony, you select SERVICES File Retrieve and then press the SERVICES orMENU key.andP;  Even though having the list is helpful, it's difficult todifferentiate one worksheet from another with only the file names as clues.andM;The index worksheet described here provides a solution.andP;  It allows you todisplay a lengthy description along with each worksheet's file name.andP;  It alsoprovides a macro that automatically retrieves a file when you highlight thefile name with the cell pointer and press Return.andP;  Building the worksheetoffers yet another benefit--an easy-to-understand introduction to theversatile @CELLPOINTER function and to the macro [LET] statement.andM;The hardest part of creating an index is collecting and entering your 1-2-3and Symphony worksheet file names.andP;  With the techniques used in this article,even that chore is a snap.andP;  You let DOS do most of the work for you.andP;  In1-2-3 Releases 2.2 and 3, the /File Admin Table command does all the work.andO;Keeping the index up-to-date is easy if you add names and descriptions to itas you build and save new worksheets.andM;Once you build the index worksheet, save it with a name that will appear atthe beginning of the list of file names produced by the File Retrievecommand.andP;  That way, no matter how many worksheet files are in a subdirectory,you can always quickly locate your index.andM;This index system is designed for use on a hard disk, and it retrievesworksheet files from the current directory.andP;  If you store 1-2-3 or Symphonyworksheet files in several subdirectories, you need to create an indexworksheet for each one.andP;  The index works in 1-2-3 Releases 2/2.01, 2.2, and 3and with all versions of Symphony.andM;HOW IT WORKSandM;Instructions for building the index worksheet appear in the box on the right.andO;A hypothetical worksheet index appears in the top figure.andP;  Column A containsa list of file names and extensions.andP;  Column B contains long labels thatdescribe the contents or the purpose of the files listed in column A.andP;  Youcan use as many rows as necessary in column B to describe files.andP;  Skipping arow between entries makes the comments in column B easier to read.andM;To keep file names and comments within the width of a single screen, limitthe length of each comment line to 57 characters.andP;  If you're concerned aboutsaving disk space and RAM, you need not skip a row between entries.andP;  Use thePageUp and PageDown keys to move quickly through long lists of file names.andM;You retrieve a file by placing the cell pointer in the cell in column A thatcontains the name of the file you want.andP;  When you start the macro by holdingdown the MACRO key (Alt on most computers) and pressing R, 1-2-3 and Symphonyretrieve the file whose name is in the cell where the cell pointer resides.andO;The spelling of a file name in the worksheet and on the hard disk must beidentical.andP;  Otherwise, 1-2-3 and Symphony will not be able to locate thefile.andP;  Whether the file name on the worksheet list is in uppercase orlowercase doesn't affect the process.andM;The macro that drives the file-retrieval operation appears in the screen tothe right.andP;  It uses [LET] statement in conjunction with the @CELLPOINTERfunction to supply a file name to a File Retrieve command.andP;  The @CELLPOINTERfunction returns the character string in the cell that is highlighted by thepointer.andP;  A [LET] statement stores the string that is returned in the cellnamed filename (cell K1).andP;  The File Retrieve command in cell K4 uses thestring stored in cell K1 as the file name.andM;A[LET] statement is an advanced macro command that stores a cell entry in aspecified cell location.andP;  The [LET] statement in this macro takes twoarguments: location and string.andP;  Cell K1, named filename, is the locationargument.andP;  The second argument is a string of characters returned by an@CELLPOINTER function.andM;Depending on its argument, @CELLPOINTER returns a variety of informationabout the cell in which the pointer is located.andP;  It can return a cell'saddress, contents, format, width, label prefix, row number, column number,and more.andP;  In this macro, @CELLPOINTER(&quot;contents&quot;) returns the characterentered in the current cell.andP;  When you place the cell pointer in a cellcontaining a file name, you get the file name.andM;The second line of the macro instructs 1-2-3 and Symphony to retrieve a file.andO;The macro looks in the range named filename for the name of the file toretrieve.andM;USING THE INDEXandM;Before you use the worksheet, save it.andP;  If you don't, it erases itself thefirst time you use it to retrieve a file.andP;  When you save the index worksheet,name it 00-INDEX.andP;  1-2-3 and Symphony list worksheet files in the currentdirectory in numerical, then alphabetical, order.andP;  Naming this worksheet00-INDEX ensures that it will appear at or near the beginning of the list ofworksheet files.andP;  This enables you to locate it quickly at the beginning of awork session.andM;After you save the index worksheet, test the macro.andP;  Place the cell pointeron a file name in column A and press MACRO-R.andP;  1-2-3 and Symphony attempt toretrieve the file.andP;  If you placed the cell pointer in a cell containing oneof the file names in the figure, you're likely to see the error message Filedoes not exist.andP;  This means that the macro is working and that no file withthe name you highlighted exists.andP;  Press the Escape key to clear the errorcondition.andM;You should not see any other error messages.andP;  If you do, double-check themacro instructions in cells K3 and K4.andP;  Be sure to use brace ([]) whereindicated and to end each entry with a tilde ([is approx.]).andP;  Also check tosee if you made the range-name assignments in column K correctly.andM;When you're sure the macro is working properly, enter in column A the filename of a worksheet in your current directory.andP;  Be sure it's spelledcorrectly.andP;  Place the cell pointer on the cell containing the name and thenpress MACRO-R.andP;  The program should load the file.andP;  Retrieve the indexworksheet and replace the entries in the figure with your own file names anddescriptions.andP;  The box entitled &quot;Easy Ways to Import File Names&quot; describestechniques for importing worksheet file names into the index worksheet.andM;Once your file names and descriptions are complete, save the index worksheetby pressing slash (in Symphony, SERVICES), selecting File Save, and entering00-index.andP;  Keep the index current by updating it regularly as you save anddelete worksheets.andP;  Back up the index on a floppy disk in case somethinghappens to the original.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
