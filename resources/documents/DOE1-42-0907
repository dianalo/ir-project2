<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-42-0907 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors developed a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (9D7) against a syntheticpeptide (P13K) selected from the deduced amino acid sequence of the constantregion of the {lambda} chain of the murine T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)(amino acids 118-130). Using this mAb, they identified a putative secondTCR expressed on peripheral blood lymphocytes from a patient with severecombined immunodeficiency (SCID) that were propagated in culture withrecombinant interleukin 2 (rIL-2) and Con A. This mAb immunoprecipitatedtwo polypeptide chains of 40 and 58 kDa under nonreducing conditionsand of 40 and 56 kDa under reducing conditions from {sup 125}I-labeleddenatured lysates of T3{sup +} WT31{sup -} lymphocytes expanded in culturefrom a SCID patient. Chemical crosslinking of {sup 125}I-labeled cellsfollowed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Leu-4 mAb under nonreducingor reducing conditions revealed that the 40- and 56-kDa polypeptide chainswere associated with the T3 differentiation antigen. These experimentswere done with polyclonal cell populations. Cloned T3{sup +} WT31{sup-} cell populations are required to determine whether the TCR containstwo {lambda} polypeptide chains. Using the same 9D7 anti-P18K mAb andimmunoblotting analysis, they identified a 35 kDa {gamma}-chain polypeptideunder reducing conditions expressed on purified L3T4{sup -} Lyt2{sup-} BALB/c mouse thymocytes. This {gamma}-chain TCR is disulfide linkedand has a molecular mass of 80 kDa under nonreducing conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
