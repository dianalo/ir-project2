The laser desorptionis performed at relatively low power (andless;10{sup 7} W/cm{sup 2}) so thatmainly neutrals are produced, which are subsequently ionized by {sup63}Ni-{beta}source induced ion-molecule reactions at atmospheric pressure.Atmospheric pressure ionization, together with the soft vaporizationmethod, produces relatively simple spectra of the explosives investigated,yielding ions that are very characteristic of each molecule for identification.The technique has great potential for high sensitivity based upon thecombination of complete laser vaporization of the sample and the APImethod, which is an extremely efficient form of ionization for thesemolecules with high electron affinities.</TEXT></DOC>
