The de-excitationrate is calculated within the framework of perturbation theory with respectto the interaction operator between the electrons of the ((dd{mu})dee)complex and the dd{mu} mesic molecule. It is shown that allowance forthe contribution from second order terms corresponding to virtual E1transitions of the dd{mu} molecule leads to an appreciable compensationof the contribution from first order terms corresponding to the E0 transition.The calculated rate {lambda}/sub dex/=0.22x10/sup 8/ s/sup -1/ is muchlower than that for the E0 transition {lambda}/sub 0//sup (m)/=1.90x10/sup8/ s/sup -1/.</TEXT></DOC>
