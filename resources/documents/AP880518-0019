The case was decided only last year, and it's already amade-for-television movie, airing Sunday and Monday on ABC. Thefour-hour ``docudrama'' is based on court transcripts and publishedaccounts of the landmark case and is remarkably fair-minded,considering the emotionally volatile subject. It was written anddirected by James Sadwith (``Bluffing It'').   JoBeth Williams is perfect as Mary Beth, a New Jersey mother oftwo married to a garbage collector. Rick Whitehead is played as asturdy, loyal, salt-of-the-earth type by Bruce Weitz.   When Mary Beth decides, seemingly selflessly, that she'd like tohelp an infertile couple, she is introduced to the well-educated,well-off Sterns _ he a biochemist, played by John Shea; she apediatrician, played by Robin Strasser.   For those familiar with the case, it may be difficult to watchthe two couples waltzing merrily into what will become anunbearable situation. At one point, the Sterns are offered theopportunity to remain anonymous, but they insist on meeting MaryBeth, and they even socialize with the Whiteheads.   If the miniseries falls to one side or the other, it is to MaryBeth's, especially in the first half when she screams all night forthe child she has been forced to give away.   William Stern, who frequently whines that he has ``no one,''must rely for sympathy on Shea's portrayal, and it works, becauseno one could despise those cocker spaniel eyes. But the movie doesshow Stern to be caring enough to give the baby back _ temporarily,he believes _ when Mary Beth appears so distraught he thinks shemight commit suicide. For her part, Elizabeth Stern comes off everybit the ``ice princess'' Mary Beth calls her.   Mary Beth drags her husband and the couple's two children alongon her emotional roller coaster. She and Rick flee in a vain effortto keep the baby Mary Beth has named Sara. The filmmakers set somescenes to the Starship song, ``Sara'': ``Sara, Sara, storms arebrewin' in your eyes. Sara, Sara, no time is a good time forgood-bye ...''   The Sterns go to court to get the baby back. The judge seals thecase ``to shield the child from publicity and notoriety.'' Littledid he know it would become a network miniseries.   Mary Beth finally calls Bill Stern from the road and says shewants to resolve the situation, but she also threatens to killherself and the baby. Stern, unbeknown to her, is taping the call,and it will become a bombshell in the trial to come.   The pawn in all of this is, of course, the infant, andthe filmmakes that point in one poignant scene as Rick and a sheriff'sdeputy grapple for the child as the camera captures her terrifiedexpression.   The second half of the movie is taken up with the court battle.In one of the odd bit parts he seems to like, Dabney Coleman playsthe Sterns' lawyer. Anne Jackson has a small part, too, as theattorney appointed to represent the child.   At the trial, Mary Beth's duplicity and instability arerevealed, and Betsy Stern, it is learned, is not infertile, thoughshe faced the risk of aggravating her multiple sclerosis if shebecame pregnant.   Stern makes some vague protests about ``father's rights.'' Butit is Mary Beth's lawyer, played by Bruce McGill, who gets the bigspeech:   ``I tell this court,'' he says, ``there is nothing morefundamentally repugnant than to permit a man to have one woman toshare his life and another to experience the sacrifice and pain ofpregnancy and a lifetime of suffering as a result of separationfrom her child. It will always be the wife of the sanitation workerwho will bear children for the pediatrician.''   The movie ends with the judge giving custody of Baby M to theSterns. A scroll updates with the results of the appeal: the NewJersey Supreme Court ruled the surrogacy contract illegal. TheSterns have custody of the baby they named Melissa, but Mary Beth,now married to another man and mother of their newborn son, hasvisitation rights.   The big question has always been how Melissa Stern will feelabout all this when she's old enough to understand it. It's atribute to Sadwith and crew that this movie would give her a prettygood idea of how adults' good intentions can go wrong _ and howmuch they all loved a baby girl.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   SCARY SHELLEY _ Showtime has announced a new series from ShelleyDuvall, actress and producer of light-hearted ``Faerie TaleTheatre'' and ``Tall Tales and Legends.''
