These include ultrasonic scanning,radioisotope scanning, computerised X-ray tomography (CT) and magneticresonance imaging (MRI). The new techniques have made a considerableimpact on radiological practice in hospital departments, not least onthe investigational process for patients suspected or known to have malignantdisease. As a consequence of the increased range of imaging techniquesnow available, there has developed a need to evaluate and compare theirusefulness. Over the past 10 years formal studies of the applicationof imaging technology have been conducted and many reports have appearedin the literature. These studies cover a range of clinical situations.Likewise, the methodologies employed for evaluating and comparing thetechniques in question have differed widely. While not attempting anexhaustive review of the clinical studies which have been reported, thispaper aims to examine the statistical designs and analyses which havebeen used. First a brief review of the different types of study is given.Examples of each type are then chosen to illustrate statistical issuesrelated to their design and analysis. In the final sections it is arguedthat a form of classification for these different types of study mightbe helpful in clarifying relationships between them and bringing a perspectiveto the field. A classification based upon a limited analogy with clinicaltrials is suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
