Although the Departmentof Labor (DOL) has no enforcement role under the Act, section 8(a) authorizesthe Secretary to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carryout the Act. Such regulations are, at a minimum, to include interpretativeregulations describing the methods by which employers may provide for appropriateservice of notice as required by the Act. DOL is inviting comment on:(1) The extent to which the Department should issue interpretative regulations;and(2) To the extent that regulations are needed the specific views of commenterson how particular sections of the law should be implemented through regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Development of Plant Closing Regulations</ITAG>With this notice, the Department invites comment after study of Pub. L.100-379. Following completion of the comment period, DOL will develop abasic policy paper on the implementation of plant closing regulations andwill publish this paper in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>for comment. Proposed regulations will be preparedafter comments are considered, and are scheduled for late November publication.Final regulations will be written once comments on the proposed regulationsare analyzed, and are scheduled to appear in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>in January 1989.A detailed summary of Pub. L. 100-379, the Worker Adjustment and RetrainingNotification Act, is provided below.Section 1(a) provides that the short title of the Act is the ``Worker Adjustmentand Retraining Notification Act''. Section 1(b) also contains the tableof contents.Section 2(a) contains definitions.Paragraph (1) of section 2(a) states that the term ``employer'' means anybusiness enterprise that employs_(A) 100 or more employees, excluding part-time employees; or(B) 100 or more employees who in the aggregate work at least 4,00 hoursper week (exclusive of hours of overtime);Paragraph (2) provides that the term ``plant closing'' means the permanentor temporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilitiesor operating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdownresults in an employment loss at the single site of employment during any30-day period for 50 or more employees excluding any part-time employees;Paragrah (3) defines the term ``mass layoff'' as a reduction in force which_(A) Is not the result of a plant closing; and(B) Results in an employment loss at the single site of employment duringany 30-day period for_(i)(I) At least 33 percent of the employees (excluding any part-time employees);and(II) At least 50 employees (excluding any part-time employees); or (ii) At least 500 employees (excluding any part-time employees);Paragraph (4) provides that the term ``representative'' means an exclusiverepresentative of employees within the meaning of section 9(a) or 8(f)of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 159(a), 158(f) or section2 of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 152);Paragraph (5) states that the term ``affected employees'' means employeeswho may reasonably be expected to experience an employment loss as a consequenceof a proposed plant closing or mass layoff by their employer;Paragraph (6) provides that subject to subsection (b), the term ``employmentloss'' means: (A) An employment termination, other than a discharge forcause, voluntary departure, or retirement, (B) a layoff exceeding 6 months,or (C) a reduction in hours of work of more than 50 percent during eachmonth of any 6-month period;Paragraph (7) defines the term ``unit of local government'' as any generalpurpose political subdivision of a State which has the power to levy taxesand spend funds, as well as general corporate and police powers; andParagraph (8) defines the term ``part-time employee'' as an employee whois employed for an average of fewer than 20 hours per week or who has beenemployed for fewer than 6 of the 12 months preceding the date on whichnotice is required.Section 2(b) contains exclusions from the defintion of employment loss.Paragraph (1) of section 2(b) provides that in the case of a sale of partor all of an employer's business, the seller shall be responsible for providingnotice for any plant closing or mass layoff in accordance with section3 of this Act, up to and including the effective date of the sale. Afterthe effective date of the sale of part or all of an employer's business,the purchaser shall be responsible for providing notice for any plant closingor mass layoff in accordance with section 3 of this Act. Notwithstandingany other provision of this Act, any person who is an employee of the seller(other than a part-time employee) as of the effective date of the saleshall be considered an employee of the purchaser immediately after theeffective date of the sale.Paragraph (2) states that notwithstanding subsection (a)(6), an employeemay not be considered to have experienced an employment loss if the closingor layoff is the result of the relocation or consolidation of part or allof the employer's business and, prior to the closing or layoff_(A) The employer offers to transfer the employee to a different site ofemployment within a reasonable commuting distance with no more than a 6-monthbreak in employment; or (B) The employer offers to transfer the employee to any other site of employmentregardless of distance with no more than a 6-month break in employment,and the employee accepts within 30 days of the offer or of the closingor layoff, whichever is later.Section 3(a) of the Act states that an employer shall not order a plantclosing or mass layoff until the end of a 60-day period after the employerserves written notice of such an order_(1) To each representative of the affected employees as of the time ofthe notice or, if there is no such representative at that time, to eachaffected employee; and(2) To the State dislocated worker unit (designated or created under titleIII of the Job Training Partnership Act) and the chief elected officialof the unit of local government within which such closing or layoff isto occur.If there is more than one such unit, the unit of local government whichthe employer shall notify is the unit of local government to which theemployer pays the highest taxes for the year preceding the year for whichthe determination is made.Section 3(b) provides for reductions of the notification period.Paragraph (1) of Section 3(b) states that an employer may order the shutdownof a single site of employment before the conclusion of the 60-day periodif as of the time that notice would have been required the employer wasactively seeking capital or business which, if obtained, would have enabledthe employer to avoid or postpone the shutdown and the employer reasonablyand in good faith believed that giving the notice required would have precludedthe employer from obtaining the needed capital or business.Paragraph (2)(A) provides that an employer may order a plant closing ormass layoff before the conclusion of the 60-day period if the closing ormass layoff is caused by business circumstances that were not reasonablyforeseeable as of the time that notice would have been required.Paragraph (2)(B) provides that no notice under this Act shall be requiredif the plant closing or mass layoff is due to any form of natural disaster,such as a flood, earthquake, or the drought currently ravaging the farmlandsof the United States.Paragraph (3) provides that an employer relying on this subsection shallgive as much notice as is practicable and at that time shall give a briefstatement of the basis for reducing the notification period.Section 3(c) pertains to extension of the layoff period. Under that subsection,a layoff of more than 6 months which, at its outset, was announced to bea layoff of 6 months or less, shall be treated as an employment loss underthis Act unless_(1) The extension beyond 6 months is caused by business circumstances (includingunforeseeable changes in price or cost) not reasonably foreseeable at thetime of the initial layoff; and(2) Notice is given at the time it becomes reasonably foreseeable thatthe extension beyond 6 months will be required.Section 3(d) relates to determinations with respect to employment loss.Under that subsection, for purposes of section 3, in determining whethera plant closing or mass layoff has occurred or will occur, employment lossesfor 2 or more groups at a single site of employment, each of which is lessthan the minimum number of employees specified in section 2(a) (2) or (3)but which in the aggregate exceed that minimum number, and which occurwithin any 90-day period shall be considered to be a plant closing or masslayoff unless the employer demonstrates that the employment losses arethe result of separate and distinct actions and causes and are not an attemptby the employer to evade the requirements of this Act.Section 4 contains exemptions. Under this section, the Act shall not applyto a plant closing or mass layoff if_(1) The closing is of a temporary facility or the closing or layoff isthe result of the completion of a particular project or undertaking, andthe affected employees were hired with the understanding that their employmentwas limited to the duration of the facility or the project or undertaking;or(2) The closing or layoff constitutes a strike or constitutes a lockoutnot intended to evade the requirements of this Act. Nothing in this Actshall require an employer to serve written notice pursuant to section 3(a)of this Act when permanently replacing a person who is deemed to be aneconomic striker under the National Labor Relations Act: <T3>Provided,</T3> That nothing in this Act shall be deemed to validateor invalidate any judicial or administrative ruling relating to the hiringof permanent replacements for economic strikers under the National LaborRelations Act.Section 5 provides for the administration and enforcement of the requirements.Section 5(a) provides for civil actions against employers.Paragraph (1) of section 5(a) states that any employer who orders a plantclosing or mass layoff in violation of section 3 of this Act shall be liableto each aggrieved employee who suffers an employment loss as a result ofsuch closing or layoff for_(A) Back pay for each day of violation at a rate of compensation not lessthan the higher of_(i) The average regular rate received by such employee during the last3 years of the employee's employment; or(ii) The final regular rate received by such employee; and(B) Benefits under an employee benefit plan described in section 3(3) ofthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1002(3),including the cost of medical expenses incurred during the employment losswhich would have been covered under an employee benefit plan if the employmentloss had not occurred.Such liability shall be calculated for the period of the violation, upto a maximum of 60 days, but in no event for more than one-half the numberof days the employee was employed by the employer.Paragraph (2) provides that the amount for which an employer is liableunder paragraph (1) shall be reduced by_(A) Any wages paid by the employer to the employee for the period of theviolation;(B) Any voluntary and unconditional payment by the employer to the employeethat is not required by any legal obligation; and(C) Any payment by the employer to a third party or trustee (such as premiumsfor health benefits or payments to a defined contribution pension plan)on behalf of and attributable to the employee for the period of the violation.In addition, any liability incurred under paragraph (1) with respect toa defined benefit pension plan may be reduced by crediting the employeewith service for all purposes under such a plan for the period of the violation.Paragraph (3) states that any employer who violates the provisions of section3 with respect to a unit of local government shall be subject to a civilpenalty of not more than $500 for each day of such violation, except thatsuch penalty shall not apply if the employer pays to each aggrieved employeethe amount for which the employer is liable to that employee within 3 weeksfrom the date the employer orders the shutdown or layoff.Paragraph (4) provides that if an employer which has violated this Actproves to the satisfaction of the court that the act or omission that violatedthis Act was in good faith and that the employer had reasonable groundsfor believing that the act or omission was not a violation of this Actthe court may, in its discretion, reduce the amount of the liability orpenalty provided for in this section.Paragraph (5) states that a person seeking to enforce such liability, includinga representative of employees or a unit of local government aggrieved underparagraph (1) or (3), may sue either for such person or for other personssimilarly situated, or both, in any district court of the United Statesfor any disrict in which the violation is alleged to have occurred, orin which the employer transacts business.Paragraph (6) provides that in any such suit, the court, in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee as part of thecosts.Paragraph (7) states that for purposes of the subsection, the term, ``aggrievedemployee'' means an employee who has worked for the employer ordering theplant closing or mass layoff and who, as a result of the failure by theemployer to comply with section 3, did not receive timely notice eitherdirectly or through his or her representative as required by section 3.Section 5(b) pertains to exclusivity of remedies. It provides that theremedies provided for in this section shall be the exclusive remedies forany violation of this Act. Under this Act, a Federal court shall not haveauthority to enjoin a plant closing or mass layoff.Section 6 provides that the rights and remedies provided to employees bythis Act are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other contractualor statutory rights and remedies of the employees, and are not intendedto alter or affect such rights and remedies, except that the period ofnotification required by this Act shall run concurrently with any periodof notification required by contract or by any other statute.Section 7 states that it is the sense of Congress that an employer whois not required to comply with the notice requirements of section 3 should,to the extent possible, provide notice to its employees about a proposalto close a plant or permanently reduce its workforce.Section 8(a) provides that the Secretary of Labor shall prescribe suchregulations as may be necessary to carry out this Act. Such regulationsshall, at a minimum, include interpretative regulations describing themethods by which employers may provide for appropriate service of noticeas required by this Act.Section 8(b) provides that the mailing of notice to an employee's lastknown address or inclusion of notice in the employee's paycheck will beconsidered acceptable methods for fulfillment of the employer's obligationto give notice to each affected employee under this Act.Section 9 states that the giving of notice pursuant to this Act, if donein good faith compliance with this Act, shall not constitute a violationof the National Labor Relations Act or the Railway Labor Act.Section 10 provides that two years after the date of enactment of thisAct the Comptroller General shall submit to the Committee on Small Businessof both the House and Senate, the Committee on Labor and Human Resources,and the Committee on Education and Labor a report containing a detailedand objective analysis of the effect of this Act on employers (especiallysmall and medium-sized businesses), the economy (international competitiveness),and employees (in terms of levels and conditions of employment). The ComptrollerGeneral shall assess both costs and benefits, including the effect on productivity,competitiveness, unemployment rates and compensation, and worker retrainingand readjustment.Section 11 states that the Act shall take effect on the date which is 6months after the date of enactment of this Act, except that the authorityof the Secretary of Labor under section 8 is effective upon enactment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Legislative History</ITAG>The April 1988 House-Senate Conference Report on H.R. 3, the Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988 (House Report 100-576) contains importantinformation for understanding the provisions of Pub. L. 100-379, sincemany aspects of the final law were developed during the drafting of H.R.3, and were clarified in the Conference. The text of the Report sectiondescribing Subtitle E, advance notification requirements, has thereforebeen included in this Notice for reference. A number of floor amendmentswere introduced in June-July Congressional debates on S. 2527, the WorkerAdjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which resulted in modificationsto the final legislation. These include, among other changes: an explanationof responsibilities of buyers and sellers of a business to notify workersif a plant closing or layoff is decided upon; the identification of naturaldisasters as the basis for reduced notice or no notice in advance of anemployer action; and stipulation that employers are not required to providenotice when permanently replacing ``economic strikers.''Excerpt from Conference Report on H.R. 3, the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenesssAct of 1988 (House Report 100-576)<ITAG tagnum="84">Subtitle E_Advance Notification of Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs</ITAG>Present Law There is no present law for this provision. House Bill The House bill contains no comparable provision. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Short Title (Sec. 6401 of Conference Agreement) </ITAG>Senate AmendmentThe Senate Amendment has no provision for a short title. The advance notificationprovisions were identified as Part B of the Economic Dislocation and WorkerAdjustment Assistance Act. Conference Agreement The Conference Agreement separates the advance notification provisionsfrom the worker adjustment provisions of the Economic Dislocation and WorkerAdjustment Assistance Act. Section 6401 of the Conference Agreement createsa new subtitle for the advance notification provisions. The short titlefor this subtitle is the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification(``WARN'') Act. By separating the advance notification provisions fromthe worker adjustment provisions, the Conferees intend as an administrativematter for the WARN Act to be an original law, not an amendment to theJob Training Partnership Act. At the same time, the Conferees reaffirmthat advance notice is an essential component of a successful worker readjustmentprogram, and they regard the two subtitles as closely interrelated. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Definitions/Exclusions From Definitions (Sec. 331, 334 (1), (2)of Senate Amendment; Sec. 6402 of Conference Agreement) </ITAG>Senate AmendmentThe Senate Amendment defines the terms ``employer,'' ``plant closing,''``mass layoff,'' ``representative,'' ``affected employees,'' ``employmentloss,'' ``unit of local government,'' ``part-time employee,'' and ``seasonalemployee.'' The Senate Amendment includes exemptions from notification for plant closingsor mass layoffs resulting from the sale or relocation of a business. Underthe exemption for sales, no notice is required if the plant closing ormass layoff results from the sale of all or part of a business and thepurchaser agrees, in writing, to hire substantially all affected employeeswith no more than a six-month break in employment. Under the relocationexemption, no notice is required if the plant closing or mass layoff resultsfrom a relocation of a business within a reasonable commuting distanceand the employer offers to transfer substantially all affected employeesto the new location with no more than a six-month break in employment. Conference Agreement The Conference Agreement adopts the definitions in the Senate Amendmentwith the following modifications: <T3>``Employer''. </T3>The Conference Agreement retains the Senate Amendmentlanguage that the term ``employer'' means a business enterprise. The Confereesintend that a ``business enterprise'' be deemed synonymous with the termscompany, firm or business, and that it consist of one or more sites ofemployment under common ownership or control. For example, General Motorshas dozens of automobile plants throughout the country. Each plant wouldbe considered a site of employment, but as provided in the bill, thereis only one ``employer''_General Motors. <T3>``Plant Closing''. </T3>The Conference Agreement strikes all referencesto ``place of employment'' and replaces them with ``single site of employment.''This change is intended to clarify that geographically separate operationsare not to be combined when determining whether the employment thresholdfor triggering the notice requirement is met. For example, an automobileassembly plant on the east side of town and an assembly plant on the westside of town ordinarily would be two separate ``sites of employment.''On the other hand, an assembly plant on the east side of town that happensto extend to both sides of a public street is <T3>not</T3> two distinct ``sites.''The Conferees otherwise retain the Senate language, but wish to clarifythat a ``temporary shutdown'' triggers the notice requirement only if thereare a sufficient number of terminations or layoffs exceeding six months,as specified under the definition of ``employment loss.''<T3>``Mass Layoff''. </T3>The Conference Agreement modifies the SenateAmendment so that the 33 percent requirement applies only to a mass layoffthat involves more than 49 but fewer than 500 employees. Where the employmentloss involves 500 or more employees, the 33 percent requirement would notapply, and notice would be required. The Conferees believe that layoffsinvolving 500 or more people are likely to cause significant economic disruptionin local communities, as well as the obvious disruption for the individualsinvolved. Thus, the rationale for advance notice is strong_the need forindividuals and communities to begin planning for dislocation before thedislocation occurs. The jurisdiction for a 33 percent requirement for layoffsbefore notice is required has been the represenation by business intereststhat small layoffs of 50 or 100 or even 200 employees at a single sitewith a workforce of perhaps a thousand or more employees are such a regularpart of business that requiring notice in these circumstances would beunduly burdensome. Because a layoff of 500 employees at a site of employmentis a significant and unusual action, even in a large workforce of 2000or more employees, the requirement of advance notice in these situationsshould not place an undue burden on employers. <T3>``Employment Loss''. </T3>The Senate Amendment includes two kinds oflayoffs that would trigger the bill's requirements_those of indefiniteduration and those of definite duration exceeding 6 months. The ConferenceAgreement combines these into a single triggering event_a layoff exceeding6 months. The Senate Amendment includes within its definition of an employmentloss a reduction in hours of more than 50 percent during any 6-month period.The Conference Agreement clarifies that this reduction in hours must occurin each of 6 consecutive months to be considered an employment loss. Asan example, an employee who works less than half-time for five consecutivemonths, but who works full-time in the sixth, would not be considered tohave experienced an employment loss. <T3>``Part-time employee''. </T3>The Senate Amendment defines a ``part-timeemployee'' as one who is hired to work an average of fewer than 15 hoursper week. It also defines a ``seasonal employee'' as one who is hired fora period not to exceed 3 months per year to do work that is seasonal innature. The Conference Agreement combines these concepts into a singledefinition of ``part-time'' employee, which includes employees who workfewer than 20 hours per week or who have worked fewer than 6 months inthe 12-month period prior to the point at which the employer is requiredto serve notice. The definition of ``seasonal employee'' is therefore eliminated.<T3>Exclusions from Definition of Employment Loss. </T3>The ConferenceAgreement incorporates the exemptions from notification for sales and relocationsof a business in modified form as exclusions from the definition of ``employmentloss.'' Thus, a closing or layoff resulting from the sale of part or allof the employer's business does <T3>not </T3>give rise to an employment loss if (a) the employee is covered at the time of the sale by a written rehireagreement between the buyer and the seller of the business to which theemployee is explicitly made a third party beneficiary with rights againstthe purchaser under applicable state law; or (b) the employee within 30 days after the sale is offered employment bythe buyer. In addition, a closing or layoff resulting from the relocation of consolidationof part or all of the employer's business does <T3>not </T3>give rise to an employment loss for a particular employeeif, prior to the employee's termination or layoff, (a) the employer offers to transfer that employee within a reasonable commutingdistance; or (b) the employer offers to transfer the employee to any other site of employmentregardless of distance, and the employee accepts within 30 days of theoffer or of the termination or layoff, whichever is later. An example to which this may apply would be a situation where an employerowns five grocery stores in a metropolitan area. After deciding that oneof the stores is no longer competitive, the employer decides to shut itdown and makes a timely offer to transfer its employees to one or moreof the remaining stores with no more than a six-month break in employment.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Notice Requirements (Sec. 332(a) of Senate Amendment; Sec. 6403(A)of Conference Agreement)</ITAG>Senate AmendmentThe Senate Amendment requires 60 days notice in advance of a plant closingor mass layoff to affected employees (or their representative), to theState dislocated worker unit designated or created under the Economic Dislocationand Worker Adjustment Assistance Act, and to the chief elected officialof the unit of local government where the closing or layoff occurs.Conference AgreementThe Conference Agreement adopts the Senate provision.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Reduction of Notification Period (Sec. 332(b) of Senate Amendment;Sec. 6403(b) of Conference Agreement)</ITAG>Senate AmendmentThe Senate Amendment provides for a reduction of the notification periodin two specific circumstances. Under the ``faltering company'' exception,an employer actively seeking capital or business which would avoid or postponeindefinitely a shutdown, need not give the full 60 days notice if the employerreasonably and in good faith believes that notice would preclude the employerfrom obtaining the needed capital or business.Under the second exception, the notice requirement is reduced if the closingor mass layoff is caused by business circumstances not reasonably foreseeableat the time notice would have been required. Both exceptions require theemployer to give as much notice as is practicable and provide a brief statementof the basis for reducing the notice period.Conference AgreementAfter some discussion, the Conferees agree to retain both exceptions, butwish to clarify the meaning of the Senate Amendment as follows:<T3>Faltering Company. </T3>The provision would permit, under specificallydefined circumstances, an employer to shut down one or more sites of employmentwithout providing the full notice required by the bill. The defense isintended as a narrow one applicable only where it was unclear 60 days beforethe closing whether the closing would occur; the employer was activelypursuing measures that would avoid or indefinitely postpone the closing;and the employer reasonably believed both that it had a realistic opportunityof obtaining the necessary capital or business and that giving notice wouldprevent the employer's actions from succeeding.The key phrases are first that the employer was ``actively seeking capitalor business''; second that, had the employer obtained this capital or business,it ``would have enabled the employer'' to prevent or forestall the shutdown;and third, that the employer ``reasonably and in good faith believed''that giving the notice required would have precluded the employer fromobtaining the necessary capital or business that it had a realistic opportunityto obtain. Thus, to avail itself of this defense an employer must provethe specific steps it had taken, at or shortly before the time notice wouldhave been required, to obtain a loan, to issue bonds or stock, or to securenew business. This duty to seek capital or business falls on the employer,not the single site alone, and assumes that the employer lacks the necessarycapital or business. Moreover, the employer must show the reasonable basisfor its good-faith belief that giving the required notice would have preventedthe employer from obtaining the capital or business that the employer hada realistic opportunity to obtain. Finally, the employer also must showthat, upon learning that the workplace would be closed, it promptly notifiedthe employees and explained why earlier notice had not been given.<T3>Unforeseeable Business Circumstances. </T3>The Conferees recognizethat there may be cases in which unforeseeable events necessitate a plantclosing or mass layoff and it is not economically feasible to require theemployer to give notice and wait until the end of the notice period beforeeffecting the plant closing or mass layoff. For example, a natural disastermay destroy part of a plant; a principal client of the employer may suddenlyand unexpectedly terminate or repudiate a major contract; or an employermay experience a sudden, unexpected and dramatic change in business conditionssuch as price, cost, or declines in customer orders. In these situations,the employer is required to give notice as soon as the closing or masslayoff becomes reasonably foreseeable, but the employer is permitted toimplement the proposed closing or layoff without waiting until the endof the full notice period.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Extension of Layoff Period (Sec. 332(c) of Senate Amendment; Sec.6403(c) of Conference Agreement)</ITAG>Senate AmendmentThe Senate Amendment provides that a layoff of definite duration of lessthan six months that extends beyond six months shall be treated as a layoffof indefinite duration subject to notification unless (1) the extensionis caused by business circumstances not reasonably foreseeable at the timeof the initial layoff; and (2) notice is provided as soon as it is reasonablyforeseeable that the extension is required.Conference AgreementThe Conference Agreement has eliminated the concept of a layoff of indefiniteduration as was provided in the Senate Amendment. Therefore, the Confereeshave modified the language of section 6403(c) to conform that section tothe simplified definition in section 6402(a)(6). Employers operating underthis provision lawfully may postpone giving notice until some time aftera layoff has commenced <T3>only </T3>if they announced when ordering the layoff that the layoffwould be for less than six months and if the employer proves that the layoffhas been extended due to unforeseeable business circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Determination of Employment Loss (Sec. 333(c) of Senate Amendment;Sec. 6403(d) of Conference Agreement) </ITAG>Senate AmendmentThe Senate Amendment provides for the determination of a plant closingor mass layoff based on aggregation of smaller employment losses. Underthe Amendment, employment losses at a single site for 2 or more groupsof employees, each of which is less than 50 employees, but which in theaggregate total at least 50 employees, that occur within a 90-day period,will be considered a closing or layoff subject to notification, unlessthe employer demonstrates the employment losses result from separate anddistinct actions and causes and are not an attempt to evade the noticerequirements.Conference AgreementLanguage has been added to conform this subsection to the definition ofmass layoff that appears in section 6402(a)(3). The Conferees wish to clarifythat the requirement that a mass layoff of 50 to 499 employees must effect33 percent of the employees at a particular employment site also appliesto this section. The ``33 percent'' requirement was inadvertently omittedfrom the language approved by the Senate. Thus, for example, an employeremploying 300 workers at a single site which laid off 25 employees on eachof four separate occasions within a 90-day period would presumptively bedeemed to have implemented a mass layoff of more than 50 employees affecting33 percent of the workforce. On the other hand, no such presumption wouldarise where the same employer laid off 20 employees on each of 4 occasionsover the same 90-day period, because the ``33 percent'' requirement wouldnot have been met.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Exemptions (Sec. 334 (3), (4) of Senate Amendment; Sec. 6404 ofConference Agreement)</ITAG>Senate AmendmentThe Senate Amendment exempts particular plant closings and mass layoffsfrom the notice requirements. No notice is required if the closing is ashutdown of a temporary facility or the mass layoff results from the completionof a particular project so long as the affected employees were hired withthe understanding that the job was limited to the duration of the facilityor project.The Senate Amendment also exempts from the notice requirements those closingsor layoffs that constitute a strike or a lockout.Conference AgreementAs discussed earlier in this Report, the Conference Agreement transformstwo exemptions in the Senate Amendment_for sale and relocation of a business_intoexclusion from the definition of ``employment loss.'' The Conference Agreementretains the remaining two exemptions as exemptions with the following modifications:<T3>Temporary Facility. </T3>The Conference Agreement adds language toclarify that this exception applies either to a closing or to a layoff.In addition, the Agreement carifies that the exemption from the noticerequirement is available where the closing or layoff is the result of thecompletion of a particular ``undertaking,'' as well as a particular ``project.''Use of the term ``project'' in the Senate Amendment had been read by someas precluding its application to certain other temporary activities. TheSenate floor debate included discussion of this exemption, and the Confereesfelt that clarification of the intent of the Senate provision would beadvisable.There are two basic requirements for this exemption to apply. First, theemployees in question must have been hired with the understanding thattheir jobs would last only until an obviously limited activity of the employerwas completed. This condition must have been clearly stated to the employesat the time they begin work. Second, the work must in fact be temporaryor limited. The Conferees do not intend that employers be able to avoidthe notice requirement by a formal process of periodically telling workersthat their jobs will last only until completion of a particular projector undertaking, when both employer and emplyees expect and intend to continuethe employment relationship indefinitely.Thus, floor statements by the sponsors of the bill in the Senate indicatedthat the exemption could apply to shipbuilding and overhaul projects whereemployees were hired with the requisite understanding and where the workis in fact only for the duration of a particular project. Although theprecise date on which operations will cease sometimes cannot be specifiedat the beginning of the undertaking, the employees know that when the workis done, their jobs will lapse. Similarly, this exemption also applieswhere an employer hires employees for a specified and obviously limitedterm and the employees are informed in writing of the exact date of terminationeither at the outset or at some other point preceding the 60-day noticeperiod.<T3>Lockout. </T3>The Senate bill exempts closings and layoffs from thenotice requirement when they constitute a strike or lockout. A lockoutoccurs when, for tactical reasons relating to collective bargaining, anemployer refuses to utilize some or all of its employees for the performanceof available work. The Conference Agreement clarifies that only lockoutsnot undertaken for the purpose of evading the notice requirements qualifyfor the exemption. An employer may not, for example, shut down an establishmentand evade the notice requirement by calling the shutdown a lockout.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Administration and Enforcement of Notice Requirements (Sec. 333(a),(b) of Senate Amendment, Sec. 6405, 6408 of Conference Agreement)</ITAG>SenateAmendmentThe Senate Amendment establishes enforcement mechanisms against an employerwhich fails to meet the requirements. An employee who suffers an employmentloss and who does not receive timely notice (either directly or throughthe employee's representative) may bring a civil action against the employer.The employer would be liable for back pay for each day of the violationplus the cost of related fringe benefits for each day of the violationminus any earnings or related fringe benefits received from the employerduring the violation period.If the employer does not provide timely notice to the unit of local government,the employer would be subject to a civil penalty equal to $500 for eachday of the violation. If more than one unit of local government has jurisdictionover the area in which the closing or layoff will occur, the employer mustnotify only the unit of local government to which the employer paid thehighest taxes for the year preceding the year when the notice is required.The Senate Amendment provides that a court may reduce an employer's liabilityto employees or an employer's penalty to the unit of local government ifthat employer demonstrates that it acted in good faith and had reasonablegrounds for believing it was not violating the notice requirements.The Senate Amendment includes venue and attorneys' fees provisions. A personseeking to enforce the liability provisions of this part may sue, individuallyor on behalf of others similarly situated, in any U.S. district court ina district in which the violation occurred or in which the employer transactsbusiness. A court, in addition to any judgment awarded to plaintiffs underthis section, may allow a reasonable attorneys' fee.The remedies provided for in the Senate Amendment are the exclusive remediesavailable for violation of the notice requirements.Conference AgreementThe Conference agreement adopts the Senate provision with the followingmodifications:<T3>Each day of violation. </T3>The Senate Amendment provides that an employerwhich violates the notice provisions of section 6403 is liable for backpay and a civil fine for ``each day of violation.'' The Conferees wishto clarify that ``each day of violation'' is limited to the requisite noticeperiod. Thus, the maximum violation period is 60 days, and it could beless depending upon the amount of notice given by the employer. For example,if the employer provides 20 days notice, then the maximum violation periodfor purposes of calculating back pay awards or civil fines would be 40days. (``Violation period'' refers to the period of time after a shutdownor layoff in violation of this Act, and extends for the number of daysthat notice was required but not given.)<T3>Damage payments to employees.</T3> The Conference Agreement modifiesthe Senate Amendment language pertaining to offset. The Conferees wishto clarify that for each day of violation, an employer is liable to eachaggrieved employee for the amount paid in wages and benefits to such employeeprior to the layoff, as set forth in section 6405(a)(1). The Confereesalso intend that an employer may satisfy its liability with respect tobenefits by paying the cash value of such benefits for the period of violation,subject to the offset provisions in section 6405(a)(2).Under 6405(a)(2), the amount owed by the employer may be reduced throughcertain payments made by the employer for the period of the violation.An offset would occur if the employer's mass layoff involved a reductionin hours of 75 percent for 6 consecutive months, but the employer continuedto pay the affected employees 25 percent of their wages. The offset provisionalso would apply if an employer offers employees a payment (in the absenceof any legal obligation), in a voluntary and unconditional effort to easethe burden of termination or simply as a gesture of goodwill. (The Confereeswish to note here that damages are fully satisfied when an employer makesthe payment prescribed in section 6405(3)). If the employer continues tomake payments to a third party or trustee (such as premiums for healthbenefits or payments to a defined contribution pension plan), which areattributable to the employee for the violation period, the payments madealso would offset the back pay remedy. Finally, with respect to the portionof benefit liability arising from a defined benefit pension plan, an employercould satisfy that portion of its liability by crediting the employee withservice for all purposes for the period of the violation.By contrast, payments owing because of written or oral agreement, and madeon account of the employment loss, would not offset the back pay remedy.Such payments may include severance pay, pension benefits or any otherkind of benefit that an employee is entitled to receive. These are benefitsthat are payable as compensation for past services because a layoff orshutdown has occurred, whether or not the terms of the layoff or shutdownactually violate the Act. In addition, they are benefits that an employeewould not receive if employment had continued.Further, the only payments that may offset the back pay remedy are thosemade by the violating employer. Wages received from another employer, orunemployment compensation payments received from the State, may not beused to offset the remedy.<T3>Damage payments to local governments.</T3> The Conferees intend thatemployers which violate the notice requirements with respect to the affectedunit of local government be subject to a civil penalty of up to $500 perday of violation. Thus, the maximum penalty payable to a local governmentis $30,000. In the event that a violation is found, a court in determiningthe amount of the penalty may take into account the severity of the violation,the employer's size, and the employer's ability to pay such a penalty.The Conferees further intend to provide an incentive and a mechanism foremployers to satisfy their obligation to their employees in the event theyfail to provide 60 days advance notice to their employees. An employerwill be relieved of the $500-a-day penalty to the local unit of governmentif it fully and promptly satisfies any financial liability to its employeesunder section 6405(a)(1). In order to avoid the payment to the unit oflocal government, an employer must complete full payment to its employeeswithin 3 weeks from the point at which it orders a shutdown or layoff.In addition, the Conferees agree that the Secretary of Labor should beauthorized to promulgate regulations to ease administration and enforcementof the WARN Act. The Conference Agreement recognizes that interpretiveregulations could play a constructive role in the implementation of thislegislation.Although the Department of Labor does not have an enforcement role, theAgreement authorizes the Secretary of Labor to promulgate regulations ashe or she deems necessary. At a minimum, these regulations must prescribestandards governing the service of notice to affected employees. The Confereesintend that an employer be diligent in its effort to notify a representativeof employees or the employees themselves. At the same time, the Confereesdo not expect an employer to go to extraordinary and unreasonable lengthsto notify each and every employee. For example, a mailing to the currentaddresses of employees might suffice, even though a few employees mighthave moved unbeknownst to the employer.9. <T4>Relation to Other Rights (</T4><T4>Sec. </T4>335 <T4>of Senate Amendment, Sec. </T4>6406 <T4>of Conference Agreement</T4>)Senate AmendmentThe Senate Amendment provides that the rights and remedies provided underthe advance notification provisions are in addition to any other contractualor federal statutory rights and remedies available to affected employees.Conference AgreementThe Conference Agreement provides that with one exception the rights andremedies provided under the advance notification provisions do not preemptor displace rights and remedies provided under other statutes or undercontractual agreements. The Conferees are aware that many legal issuesrelated to plant closings and mass layoffs currently may be addressed undercollective bargaining agreements and some of these same issues also maybe dealt with under state or other federal law. <T3>See, e.g., Fort Halifax Packing Company </T3>v. <T3>Coyne, </T3>107 S. Ct. 2211 (1987) (ERISA does not preempt state lawprescribing severance pay). The Conferees intend that the effect of theseother laws and contracts should not be disturbed by the new federal provision.The only qualification to this rule involves the length of notice beforea plant shutdown, the 60-day requirement contained in this bill will runconcurrently with the 90-day requirement under state law. Similarly, ifa collective bargaining agreement requires that an employer give 120 daysnotice before closing a plant, the new 60-day requirement will run concurrentlywith the longer contractual notice period.10. <T4>Sense of the Congress on Notice </T4>(<T4>Sec. </T4>336 <T4>of Senate Amendment, Sec. </T4>6407 of Conference Agreement)Senate AmendmentThe Senate Amendment expresses the sense of Congress that an employer notrequired by this Act to provide advance notice of a plant closing or masslayoff is encouraged to provide advance notice irrespective of its obligationsunder federal law.Conference AgreementThe Conference Agreement adopts the Senate provision.11.Effect on Other Laws (Sec. 338 of Senate Amendment, Sec. 6409 of ConferenceAgreement)Senate AmendmentThe Senate Amendment provides that an employer attempting in good faithto comply with the advance notice provisions of the Act cannot be foundin violation of the National Labor Relations Act or the Railway Labor Act.Conference AgreementThe Conference Agreement adopts the Senate provision.<ITAG tagnum="81">12.
