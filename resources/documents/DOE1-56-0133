The questionaireconsists of two parts. One part contains questions regarding the testingpersonnel, facilities, equipment and maintenance and management of theequipment. The other part deals with accidents that had occurred withinthe areas under management, potential risks that may cause accidents,measures to improve safety management, troubles with and failure of equipment,and requests and opinions directed to equipment manufactures. It is concludedfrom results of the survey that to raise the safety of equipment, so-calledman-machine interfaces should be improved by increasing the durabilityof equipment and performance of the personnel operating the equipmentwhile reducing the physical and mental effects on the persons subjectedto testing. Systematic educational measures, including lecture meetingsand training courses, are required to raise the consciousness of personnel.Such education and training should cover safety handling techniques,including those for checking of equipment and for instructing and helpingthe persons under testing.
