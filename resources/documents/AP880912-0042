(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Newly crowned Miss America GretchenElizabeth Carlson, a Minnesota car dealer's daughter whose brothersonce called her ``blimpo,'' is a sushi-loving Swedish-American whohopes to be a corporate attorney.   The confident new Miss America 1989 says chance didn't figureinto her win.   ``This wasn't luck,'' she said just hours after her crowning inthis seaside resort's Convention Center early Sunday, adding thatshe didn't bring any good-luck charms to the 62nd Miss AmericaPageant.   The 22-year-old woman from the Minneapolis suburb of Anoka saidher own skills brought her the crown. After winning a preliminarytalent competition earlier in the week, Miss Minnesota said partsof her performance were ``exquisite.''   Miss Carlson performed a spirited violin solo titled ``GypsyAirs.'' She has studied violin for 17 years, winning national andstate violin competitions and performing a solo with the MinnesotaOrchestra.   ``I'm definitely an overachiever,'' she said.   This year, pageant officials took special pains to emphasizethat the judges were looking for an ``articulate, educated, dynamicrole model'' and not just a beauty queen.   Miss Carlson is several credits away from graduating fromStanford University with a degree in organizational behavior. Shesays she wants to attend Harvard Law School ``and become asuccessful corporate executive.''   But for the next year, Miss Carlson will tour the countrypromoting the Miss America scholarship program. She also will pushthe products of the pageant's corporate sponsors, includingunderwear, orange juice, pantyhose and hair coloring.   Last year's Miss America, Kaye Lani Rae Rafko, also used herreign to promote nursing.   Miss Carlson said she wants to focus on ``education for thechildren of tomorrow.'' Specifically, she wants to see childrenreceive more education on values, ``teaching children to be lessnarcissistic.''   ``Today children tend to be more in love with themselves insteadof being in love with other people,'' said Miss Carlson.   The new queen traveled later Sunday to New York City with MissRafko, who will stay on for several days to orient the newtitleholder. Miss Carlson planned to pick out a personal wardrobefor the year and prepare for television appearances.   When asked what kind of Miss America she would make, MissCarlson laughed and replied, ``A short one.''   The 5-foot-3 Miss Carlson didn't have to bend when Miss Rafkoplaced the crown on her head. At 108 pounds, she is 20 poundslighter than the hefty 128 she weighed when she was 16.   ``When I used to be fat, my brothers used to call me `blimpo,''' she said, adding that she ``went on this major diet and lost allthis weight.''   Today the green-eyed blonde of Swedish descent likes to dine onsushi.   Sunday's crowning was supposed to be just before midnightSaturday, but was delayed almost 12 minutes after judges had tocast new ballots to break a tie for second runner-up.   Miss Colorado Maya Walker was named first runner-up, MissOklahoma Lori Lee Kelley won second runner-up, Miss CaliforniaMarlies Sharleen Ricardos was third runner-up and Miss AlabamaJenny Lee Jackson was fourth runner-up.</TEXT></DOC>
