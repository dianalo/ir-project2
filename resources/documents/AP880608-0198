Students held rallies at many schools nationwide in support ofthe planned march Friday to demand South Korea's reunification withthe north. Violent clashes occurred at more than 10 campuses, wherestudents dashed out to hurl firebombs and rocks at riot police whoresponded with volleys of tear gas.   It was not known immediately how many people were injured orarrested.   ``Drive out the Yankees who enforce the partition of our land!''students shouted during the clashes. Radicals have demanded thewithdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under amutual defense pact, contending the U.S. presence hindersreunification of the divided peninsula.   The radicals represent a small, but powerful minority on collegecampuses, with the most extreme, pro-leftist elements increasinglytaking control of the protest movement as its support has declined.   Radical student leaders have called for up to 40,000 students torally at Seoul's Yonsei University on Thursday for an overnightvigil before the 30-mile march to the North Korean border.   Police said the university would be completely sealed offThursday to block the planned rally, but student leaders threatenedto stage violent protests in downtown Seoul if the vigil is blocked.   Tens of thousands of riot police took positions Wednesday aroundcampuses and other key locations across the country to stopstudents from rallying in support of the march.   Some radicals vowed to commit suicide. Three students havekilled themselves in recent anti-government protests.   Police Wednesday intercepted students as they marched in protestoff university campuses in the southern city of Kwangju and thesoutheast city of Taegu.   In the southern port city of Pusan, 5,000 students from 12schools held a common rally at a university before leaving forSeoul, although thousands of police guarded bus terminals andrailway stations to block their way.   On campuses in other provincial cities, students occupied schoolbuildings after faculty members refused their demands to providetransport.   In an interview with The Hankook Ilbo, an independent Seoulnewspaper, President Roh Tae-woo said he supports exchanges anddebate between South Korean and North Korean students.   But the president urged students to leave contact with the northto official channels and cautioned against leftist or revolutionarymovements trying to topple South Korea's liberal democracy.   Opposition party leaders also appealed to students to postponetheir plans for the march, saying it lacked national support.   Reunification has been a deeply emotional issue among Koreanssince the peninsula was divided after World War II into communistNorth Korea and pro-Western South Korea.   Most South Koreans support unification of the two Koreas, butmany fear the north is determined to invade the south, as it did in1950.   North Korea, which welcomed the proposed student talks, hasselected a 13-member student delegation to attend the plannedmeeting Friday at the border village of Panmunjom, inside theDemilitarized Zone dividing the two Koreas.</TEXT></DOC>
