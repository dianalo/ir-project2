(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Brand family scurried Thursday toget the farm spruced up for some special guests: Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa.   ``I'll clean the house if I have time,'' said Cecilia Brand, wholearned Wednesday that the Russians might be coming to the farmabout 20 miles south of Minneapolis.   ``This was a total surprise,'' said Mrs. Brand, 54. ``... I'mexcited _ and nervous.''   It wasn't certain the Gorbachevs would visit the farm duringtheir stop in Minnesota on Sunday. But Mrs. Brand said she'd beentold the Soviet president would probably arrive that evening aftermeeting with business and agricultural leaders in Minneapolis.   ``We think of ours as a typical American farm and want to conveywhat American farm life is like,'' Mrs. Brand said as she stopped torelax for a few minutes during a hectic Thursday.   The Brands were trying to keep up with their chores and fieldwork as they clean the barn and other areas and mow the lawn.   If the weather is nice, the Brands would like to sit around thepicnic table in their large yard and talk with the Gorbachevs,telling them about their family and the farm.   If it's rainy, the visit will be around the kitchen table.   ``We want to welcome them here,'' Mrs. Brand said. ``This is ouropportunity to promote some little bit of internationalunderstanding.''   Mrs. Brand and her 58-year-old husband, Richard, have a largedairy operation, milking about 75 cows. Their total herd, includingcalves and animals that will be sold for beef, numbers about 250.   They also raise alfalfa, corn and soybeans on their 240-acre farmand additional acres that they rent, and sell seed corn. And about20 to 25 cats prowl the property.   The Brands have farmed their land for 32 years. They're helped bysons, Greg, 31, and John, 27, who both live nearby.   The Brands aren't strangers to the job of entertaining foreignvisitors, and think that may be one reason they were chosen aspotential hosts to the Gorbachevs.   ``We do have a lot of foreign people who come here. We've hadseveral Chinese and Japanese and quite a few European groups,'' Mrs.Brand said. She speculated that the farm's closeness to the TwinCities could help explain why state officials frequently steervisitors her way.   However, a Gorbachev visit would be far different.   ``Security will be very, very tight,'' Mrs. Brand said.</TEXT></DOC>
