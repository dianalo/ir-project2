The eight major automakers with U.S. plants said they sold carsand light trucks at an average daily rate of 26,194 during the Nov.1-10 period compared with a 32,833-a-day pace during the same timelast year.   Car sales dropped 23.1 percent, while sales of light trucks fell15.3 percent during the period, compared with early November lastyear. In October, domestic car and truck sales tumbled 11.6 percentfrom the rate of October 1988.   The drop in U.S. car and truck sales last month pushed downOctober retail sales by 1 percent, the first decline in eightmonths.   ``We are in the midst of an automotive recession,'' said analystScott Merlis of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. in New York. ``For anybody inthis economy, these types of numbers today are not funny.   ``It's scary,'' he said. ``I don't think they are going tocontinue. I hope they won't continue.''   One of the ways automakers have accelerated auto sales recentlyis through cash rebates or cut-rate financing. The companies hadincentive programs on a wide variety of 1989 models but have lessextensive programs now.   Merlis and Phillippi said that could change.   ``Any one of them (the Big Three) has a good reason to increasethem,'' Phillippi said. Merlis said he expected bigger incentivepackages to be combined with production cuts, a move analysts havebeen expecting for months.   ``You need more than just incentives to get inventories inline,'' he said. ``This is an old-fashioned cyclical downturn witha very sad effect on the general economy.''   Sluggish car and light-truck sales during October and earlyNovember have pushed the year-to-date sales rate down 2.6 percentcompared with the same time last year. Car sales are down 3.6percent and truck sales are off 0.8 percent.   General Motors Corp. said its early November combined domesticcar and truck sales were down 26.3 percent compared with last year,with car sales dropping 29.1 percent and truck sales falling 20.9percent.   Sales of vehicles made in North America by Ford Motor Co. wereoff 19.9 percent in early November, as car sales fell 23.5 percentand truck sales dropped 14.3 percent.   At Chrysler Corp., car sales during the period were down 22.5percent and truck sales were down 9.9 percent, combining for a 16.6percent drop in the early November vehicle sales pace.</TEXT></DOC>
