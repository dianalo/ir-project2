Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) of the Senate Finance Committee had adjourned the panel Thursday when GOP senators said they wouldn't vote for any tax increase. Friday, however, he decided to go ahead without them.    &quot;As elected officials, we have a responsibility to make the policy decisions that affect interest rates in this country, our economy and financial markets,&quot; Sen. Bentsen said. &quot;We must have the courage to make the tough decisions.&quot;    In the House, Democrats also are drafting a tax increase without the Republicans, and will continue work this week.    The tax measure would be part of a deficit-reduction package for fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1. </TEXT></DOC>
