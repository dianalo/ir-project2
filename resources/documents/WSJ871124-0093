U.S. trade officials said such a ban would cost the U.S. an equivalent amount of export sales each year. However, these sanctions will be suspended for as long as the EC delays putting the ban into effect, the officials said. Last week, the EC Council of Agricultural Ministers voted to delay for a year the ban, which was to have taken effect next Jan. 1.    Some U.S. trade officials described the White House move as a precautionary one to ensure the one-year delay, and to exert pressure to extend the delay beyond 1989.    The EC Council has defended the ban on health grounds. The U.S., citing Food and Drug Administration studies, says the proper use of these hormones poses no health problems.    U.S. officials said public hearings will be held next month to determine a list of European products to be subject to the sanctions.    This is the second time in less than two weeks that the White House has threatened trade retaliation. On Nov. 13, Mr. Reagan ordered similar sanctions to be prepared against $105 million in Brazilian products to prod Brazil into reversing what is in effect a ban on imports of U.S. software products. </TEXT></DOC>
