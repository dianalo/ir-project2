<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-22-1018 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Waste Package/Repository Impact Study was conducted to evaluate thefeasibility of using the current reference salt waste package in thesalt repository conceptual design. All elements of the repository thatmay impact waste package parameters, i.e., (size, weight, heat load)were evaluated. The repository elements considered included waste hoistfeasibility, transporter and emplacement machine feasibility, subsurfaceentry dimensions, feasibility of emplacement configuration, and temperaturelimits. The evaluations are discussed in detail with supplemental technicaldata included in Appendices to this report, as appropriate. Results andconclusions of the evaluations are discussed in light of the acceptabilityof the current reference waste package as the basis for salt conceptualdesign. Finally, recommendations are made relative to the salt projectposition on the application of the reference waste package as a basisfor future design activities. 31 refs., 11 figs., 11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
