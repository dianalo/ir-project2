Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York told Congress recently. &quot;That's where the money is.&quot;    But breaking into Japan isn't easy for big U.S. and European financial houses. Western bankers complain of cultural barriers, high costs and market inefficiencies. Not the least of the problems, they say, is a regulatory environment that sometimes resembles the Mad Hatter's tea party in Alice in Wonderland.    Still, the newcomers keep trying. In the past three years, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.'s Japanese operations have grown to about 450 people from just 40. Earlier this year, Salomon Brothers Inc. increased the capital of its Tokyo branch tenfold to 56 billion yen (about $375 million), making it Japan's fifth largest securities firm overnight. And Citibank recently negotiated an agreement with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the world's biggest, that will give its customers access to the Japanese bank's automatic teller machines.    Japan &quot;is the world's most competitive market on one hand and a very protected one on the other,&quot; says Ralph Ziegler, head of Union Bank of Switzerland's Tokyo branch.    Protecting Japan's financial system, delicately deregulating it and looking over everybody's shoulder is the Ministry of Finance. U.S. bankers grouse about rules they think make no sense, laws that seem unenforced and the ministry's &quot;gyosei shido,&quot; or administrative guidance. (The latter is a vague system of control that lacks the force of law yet carries the implied threat of reprisal.)    In the U.S. and in Europe, says a senior U.S. commercial banker in Tokyo, &quot;you know what the regulations are. What you can do. What you can't do. What door you have to knock on to get something done. Here, it's so much more subtle and complex. You don't know whether what you're doing complies with the spirit of what they want, or not.&quot;    A frequent complaint is that Japan hasn't deregulated fast enough and adopted fancy new financial instruments the way the U.S. has. Commissions on most stock transactions are fixed. There is no commercial paper market and, effectively, no Treasury bill or repurchase-agreement markets. Options are prohibited, and a new equity futures market is considered incomplete.    &quot;It's the U.S. of the 1950s. The Japanese market is an oligopoly, with four firms controlling the overwhelming majority of the business,&quot; asserts Mark J. Lerner, head of the Japan banking group for Merrill Lynch in New York.    Japan has four of the world's biggest securities firms and seven of the world's 10 largest banks. The former control about 50% of the trading on the Tokyo exchange. And the latter have access to a huge pool of inexpensive deposits and very strong ties to Japan's major corporations, in which they also can own stock.    Statistically, the foreigners' inroads in Japan look puny. The 80 foreign banks in Japan, 19 of which are U.S. banks, account for a mere 3% of all banking assets there. These foreigners have less than 1% of the deposits and 1% of the profits, bankers add. And all foreign securities firms combined are estimated to account for less than 3% of the turnover of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.    Nevertheless, Tokyo is liberalizing. Prodded by Washington and other foreign governments as well as by a need to finance its own huge budget deficit, Japan is slowly deregulating interest rates. It also plans to create a commercial paper market and expand futures markets. Japan also is committed to granting foreign institutions greater access to the primary issue of government bonds.    Furthermore, subsidiaries of seven U.S. banks have been granted or will shortly receive securities licenses -- something denied Japanese banks -- that will allow them to underwrite and trade stocks and bonds. Six U.S. banks also have been granted trust banking licenses. And the Tokyo Stock Exchange has indicated that more foreigners will be admitted as members next year. Currently, six foreign firms, including four U.S. ones -- Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and a unit of Citibank -- hold seats.    &quot;Official attitudes are encouraging,&quot; says Deryck C. Maughan, head of Salomon Brothers' Tokyo operations. &quot;Nothing comes quick enough for foreigners -- including me -- but there are lots of little things that show a willingness to accept the foreigners.&quot;    Take securities issued by the U.S. Government National Mortgage Association. A few years ago, they technically didn't qualify as legal investments in Japan. But initially, &quot;A few trades were done, then a few more, then a flood,&quot; says a Tokyo-based U.S. investment banker. &quot;Then, after the fact -- because so many Ginnie Maes were lodged in Japan -- the Ministry of Finance allowed them.&quot;    Even so, many foreign bankers are angered by what they see as a piecemeal, plodding approach to change. U.S. securities firms want to be allowed to trade currencies, and they seek a larger share of domestic Japanese corporate underwritings. Commercial bankers want greater access to cheap yen funds. They also want Japan's banks to adopt the stiffer capital-adequacy ratios that are applied to U.S. and British banks.    &quot;We give (Japanese firms) decent participations in (U.S.) underwritings and get crumbs here,&quot; says Eugene D. Atkinson, president of Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp. in Tokyo. Many U.S. firms are growing increasingly frustrated with Japan's relatively closed system for issuing government bonds, and are pressing Tokyo to quickly move to a U.S.-style full auction system.    &quot;Changes in market practices aren't keeping pace with the change in regulation,&quot; says Mr. Lerner of Merrill Lynch.    To compete, Merrill Lynch is introducing two U.S.Hcompanies a month to Japanese investors. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. is building up its Tokyo investment banking unit. Salomon Brothers, considered by many to be the most successful foreign securities firm in Tokyo, has increased its staff from 100 last year to 350 now and should have 450 by year's end. Earlier this year, the firm captured the major share of an auction of Japanese government securities, something that Mr. Maughan boasts &quot;is normally considered Nomura (Securities Co.)'s birthright.&quot;    One popular strategy has been for U.S. firms to take on Japanese partners. Bankers Trust Co., for example, has a joint venture with Sumitomo Bank. And Goldman Sachs last year sold a 12.5% stake in its profits to Sumitomo Bank for a capital infusion of $500 million.    In March, Shearson Lehman Brothers sold a 13% stake to Nippon Life Insurance Co. for $508 million. That link &quot;positions us for the Japanese market, which is going to become more and more important,&quot; says Peter Cohen, Shearson's chairman.    Tougher battles may lie ahead, though, warn several investment bankers. With close to 50 foreign securities firms licensed in Tokyo, Mr. Atkinson of Goldman Sachs predicts, &quot;This next phase is going to be bludgeoning. (It) is going to be survival of the fittest of foreign firms.&quot;    ---   Mr. Sesit reports on international finance from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
