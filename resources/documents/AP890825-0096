The bankers say the Sandamp;Ls are engaged in a ``sneaky scheme'' toappropriate the name of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC),which once exclusively belonged to banks.   But James H. Grohl, senior vice president of the U.S. League ofSavings Institutions, isn't worried about the complaints over itsletter saying thrift institutions can advertise they are insured bythe FDIC.   ``Bankers are always outraged. It seems to be their eternal stateof being,'' Grohl said. ``Personally, I think they're making amountain out of a molehill here.''   Legislation signed by President Bush on Aug. 9 reorganizes thedeposit insurance bureaucracy. Under the old system, the FDICguaranteed accounts in commercial banks while the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corp. (FSLIC) backed thrift deposits.   Each type of institution displayed the initials of theirinsurance fund in a logo on their door, reassuring each depositortheir money is insured to $100,000.   The new law disbanded the FSLIC, which was out of money anyway,and gave the FDIC jurisdiction over Sandamp;L deposits. Now, the FDICmanages two funds _ the Bank Insurance Fund, or BIF, and the SavingsAssociation Insurance Fund, or SAIF _ much as a household may havetwo checking accounts.   But bankers, despite their own troubles with failures during the1980s in farm and oil-producing states, were proud of their logo anddidn't want to see it associated with Sandamp;Ls.   Congress agreed that banks could keep their FDIC logo. And, alongwith billions of dollars in taxpayers' money, Sandamp;Ls would get a newlogo with an American eagle and a message, ``Deposits federallyinsured to $100,000. Backed by the full faith and credit of theUnited States Government.''   Banks thought they had won the battle, but now they're feelingsnookered by the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.   On the very day Bush signed the Sandamp;L law, the league sent a letterto its members saying that although they could not use the FDIC logothey could advertise themselves as ``FDIC insured'' or ``insured bythe FDIC.''   Bankers went ballistic. The Independent Bankers Association ofAmerica headlined its weekly newsletter, ``Thrifts Try To RustleBanks' FDIC Brand.''   ``We've fought this one before and won. What the league is doingis a sneaky scheme to get what the Congress explicitly deniedthem,'' said Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president of theAmerican Bankers' Association.   On Thursday, the ABA sent a letter to the FDIC urging the agencynot to ``devalue the 50 years of sterling reputation garnered by theFDIC.'' Regulators, bankers argued, must forbid Sandamp;Ls from referringto any government agency as their insurer.   But Grohl said such a ruling would raise a constitutionalquestion under the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech.After all, how can the government prohibit a financial institutionfrom making a simple statement of fact?   There is a serious issue behind the rhetoric. Savings and loanslost billions of dollars in deposits earlier this year as bad newsmounted about their industry. Even rock-solid institutions hadproblems calming their customers. Bankers don't want the public toeven slightly confuse their institutions with an Sandamp;L.   Sandamp;Ls counter that ``full faith and credit of the United Statesgovernment'' means just what it says for both insurance funds.Congress just proved that by spending taxpayers' money to protectSandamp;L depositors, they say.   Alan J. Whitney, a spokesman for the FDIC, said the agency'slawyers had made a preliminary determination it's legal for Sandamp;Ls todescribe themselves as ``FDIC insured.'' The FDIC board will takethe bankers' objections under advisement, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
