SEC Chairman Richard Breeden is creating a new fraud unit at theSEC designed to police the sale of securities by savings and loaninstitutions.   Investigators have charged that some small investors lost theirlife savings when they bought securities sold by Sandamp;L branches inthe mistaken belief that their investments were protected byfederal deposit insurance.   ``We intend to see to it that when people are sold securities,they are provided all the necessary information,'' Breeden said.   Breeden also announced Tuesday that he had selected William R.McLucas, a 12-year SEC veteran, to be the new director ofenforcement at the SEC. He will succeed Gary Lynch, who resigned inJuly after supervising such landmark insider trading cases as theinvestigation of Ivan Boesky and the Wall Street firm of DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.   Both Breeden and McLucas stressed that insider trading stillwould be a top SEC priority, but they also indicated that the SEC,with a 20 percent increase in its budget, would devote moreresources to more low-profile crooks.   ``Where there is an abuse of a customer's trust, those are thekinds of cases where we are going to make sure we have an impact,''McLucas said at a news conference where his selection was announced.   Individual investors have been leaving the market in droves inrecent years, scared off in part by extreme trading volatility.Many officials believe the SEC must return to its primary missionof bolstering confidence in financial markets through protection ofthe small investor.   Breeden, who was picked for the SEC post by President Bush lastsummer, said both the administration and Congress had expressed astrong desire to crack down on abuses against individual investors.Breeden noted that Congress approved a 20 percent increase in theSEC budget this year, enough to allow the agency to hire 100 moreattorneys.   Part of the increased staffing will be used, Breeden said, tocreate a special 25-attorney unit to investigate overly aggressivesales of securities by savings and loans and other financialinstitutions.   Such sales became a major focus of congressional hearings intothe activities at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, the Irvine,Calif.-based Sandamp;L whose failure is expected to end up costingtaxpayers a record $2 billion.   Small investors told congressional investigators they were luredinto purchasing bonds in Lincoln Savings' parent company, AmericanContinental Corp., in the mistaken belief that their money wasprotected by federal deposit insurance.   When American Continental, which is headed by Arizonabusinessman Charles H. Keating Jr., filed for protection under thebankruptcy law, it left some 22,000 small investors who hadpurchased nearly $200 million in corporate bonds in the lurch.   Breeden said the new SEC unit will try to prevent financiallyailing Sandamp;Ls from turning to fraudulent practices in a desperateeffort to raise cash.   McLucas, 39, joined the SEC in 1977, two years after receiving alaw degree from Temple University.   Lynch, who resigned to join a New York law firm, served for fouryears as SEC enforcement chief, taking over from John Fedders, whowas forced to resign after allegations surfaced that he had beatenhis wife.   Lynch was credited with restoring morale at the SEC anddirecting some of the agency's biggest investigations, beginningwith the exposure of Dennis Levine in May 1986. Levine'scooperation led to a $100 million settlement with speculator IvanBoesky. Boesky in turn implicated Drexel Burnham, which led to a$650 million settlement with the securities firm, the largestsecurities fraud case ever brought by the government.   Civil and criminal charges are still pending against formerDrexel junk bond pioneer Michael Milken.</TEXT></DOC>
