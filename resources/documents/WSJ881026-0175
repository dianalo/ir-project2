For a Change&quot; is Buddy MacKay's Senate campaign slogan. &quot;Fix Bayonets&quot; or &quot;Lock and Load&quot; might do as well.    &quot;With a voting record like mine you might as well play offense,&quot; says the Ocala congressman, and after a come-from-behind win in a bitter Democratic primary, he pits himself against rival GOP Rep. Connie Mack and the disenchantment of this election year. He must buck a Republican tide here behind Vice President George Bush, but Rep. MacKay's scrappy, anti-establishment style strikes a chord of its own by giving voters what many miss in the character of the presidential race.    &quot;He's a Floridian Will Rogers,&quot; says Jerry Noyer, a 74-year-old registered Republican and civic activist in Broward County. &quot;He is authentic. He talks to people, not down to people.&quot;    This is a contest of ideology vs. the individual, with each side struggling to control the agenda. &quot;Hey Buddy, You're Liberal,&quot; taunts Rep. Mack, who links his rival with Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis and points to MacKay votes to cap Reagan tax cuts and curb Pentagon spending.    &quot;Can we trust Connie Mack?&quot; answers a MacKay television spot, which -- to the clang of slamming doors -- recites the Republican opponent's votes to restrict federal support for child nutrition, elderly care, and environment programs.    In their first major debate, the two men hammered at these themes here Monday night. Polls show a close fight for what is now a Democratic seat held by the retiring chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Lawton Chiles. Like Mississippi, Florida is a state where the GOP hopes to recover from its 1986 losses in the South, with the help of Mr. Bush. &quot;If there's a state where George Bush can help a candidate, it's Florida,&quot; says Bush manager Lee Atwater. &quot;He is a distinct plus.&quot;    Mr. Mack, 47 years old, has tied his fortunes to the GOP ticket and paints Mr. MacKay as a &quot;mainstream liberal&quot; and a threat to the anti-tax and pro-military priorities of a Bush administration. &quot;There is a new age in Florida and the new age is called Republicanism,&quot; says his campaign manager, Mitch Bainwol, a 29-year-old veteran of David Stockman's budget office and a symbol of the young voters who are most supportive of his candidate.    A good-humored, likeable man, Mr. Mack has been stung by the hard-hitting style of his Democratic opponent, but his greater problem is he may be too ideological for Florida. He lacks the pro-consumer appeal that helped former GOP Sen. Paula Hawkins win in 1980 and trades instead on his grandfather's famous baseball name to gain recognition. Democrats delight in belittling his credentials. &quot;The closest Connie Mack has ever come to a brain storm is a very light drizzle,&quot; says Simon Ferror, the first Cuban-American to hold Dade County's Democratic chairmanship.    Rep. Mack centers his campaign on the theme of freedom -- whether from communism or government generally. &quot;I looked at the 1980 (presidential) race through the eyes of a banker&quot; he reminds an audience in Delray Beach. He has promoted his own candidacy this year by hiring Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, a central figure in the Iran-Contra scandal, to speak at two events for a fee of $37,500. In six years in Congress, Mr. Mack has compiled a strong pro-business record and has repeatedly voted to cut domestic programs to finance defense. &quot;I don't know that there are any weapons offhand that I'd say I would cut,&quot; he says in an interview.    His campaign's decision to hire Col. North angered some GOP moderates, and his record on environmental legislation is a liability. He was the only Florida Republican last year to oppose a major across-the-board spending cut affecting domestic and defense programs alike, yet his pursuit of fiscal austerity has often put him at odds on other occasions with such contemporaries as GOP Rep. Clay Shaw, the former mayor of Fort Lauderdale.    Rep. MacKay's strategy is to exploit these differences, and he portrays his rival's record as &quot;anti-Florida.&quot; Democrats retain an almost 3-2 edge among the state's registered voters despite major Republican gains, but the real struggle is for the more centrist voters who split their ballots between the two parties. &quot;Every Man for Himself&quot; was V.O. Key's description of Florida politics in his classic study of the South, and the rapid growth in the four decades since hasn't wiped out this individualism.    Mr. MacKay, 55, makes the most of his past disputes with Democratic House speakers in Washington and trades on the personal contacts established in his 12 years in the Florida legislature. He has a record of trying to push his own party toward a more centrist position on domestic spending and pays a price now for once sponsoring a doomed budget plan calling for a freeze on Social Security cost-of-living increases. It was his across-the-board cut that Mr. Mack opposed in 1987. More than many Southern Democrats, Mr. MacKay has joined liberals in opposing major weapon systems.    His record includes votes against the B1 bomber, the MX missile and a generation of new chemical weapons; he supports reduced funding for the administration's Strategic Defense Initiative and Navy expansion plans around nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. In foreign policy, Mr. MacKay has given the president broad backing in the Mideast and Angola, but he has voted to impose sanctions on South Africa and end U.S. arms shipments to guerrillas in Nicaragua. This last issue, more than any other, could cost him support in Florida, where Rep. Mack envokes the Reagan Doctrine with an ad celebrating the Grenada invasion.    Big Democratic guns, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn of Georgia, are scheduled to campaign with Mr. MacKay in the conservative Panhandle. Rather than backing away, the congressman seems to relish being questioned on his defense votes. A former Air Force pilot, he says the B-1 remains a &quot;boondoggle&quot; and in a new television ad -- dubbed &quot;Fight&quot; -- he ridicules Mr. Mack's record of opposing annual bills funding federal drug-enforcement efforts. &quot;MacKay supports the death penalty to fight the drug war,&quot; the script reads.&quot;Mack cuts money we need to win the war.&quot;    It is an image of discipline -- and risk-taking -- that may serve Mr. MacKay well against his better financed rival. Mr. Mack remains defensive in explaining his experimenting with marijuana after college -- an episode that he first denied when he ran for Congress. In that same campaign in 1982, he received an estimated $40,000 under a consulting arrangement with his brother regarding a controversial cable-TV venture, yet he says he never did more than have a few phone conversations.    Mr. MacKay, by contrast, fits easily into the same Florida mold as Sen. Chiles, and in a state rife with change, there was a certain poignancy as they campaigned together last week. &quot;He's always marched to his own drum,&quot; says the three-term senator. &quot;Florida likes that when they understand that. His theme, louder than in words, is integrity.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
