Such a drop would be the largest in percentage terms among major Wall Street firms last year and contrasts with the previous year's profit, which topped the industry.    The firm's chief executive officer, Frederick H. Joseph, also told investors and clients at the firm's annual bond conference last week that he doesn't expect the government to file any charges against Drexel at least until the fall in its wide-ranging insider trading investigation, according to people who attended the meeting. The people said Mr. Joseph referred to the investigation as &quot;war.&quot;    According to attendees at the Beverly Hills, Calif., conference, Mr. Joseph also said that since 1986 Drexel has spent $132 million in legal, accounting and public relations costs in connection with the investigation. Mr. Joseph said the costs are in addition to reserves created because of the investigation. Some Drexel officials have indicated in the past that the firm has reserved money for contingency liabilities, such as possible fines, that could arise from any government action.    Mr. Joseph is said by participants to have told the conference that the Securities and Exchange Commission has almost completed its investigation of the firm, but that the U.S. Attorney's office in New York hasn't. He also said the firm hasn't done any negotiating with either government body, these people say.    Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Joseph declined to comment. The spokeswoman said that most meetings at last week's conference were private. She also declined to comment on the indicated 1987 earnings, which were derived by this newspaper from the year-to-year change in the firm's net worth. Because Drexel is privately held, it isn't required to report earnings under securities law.    The annual report, sent to shareholders, clients and others, said that net worth -- or assets minus liabilities -- increased $117 million to $1.382 billion last year from $1.265 billion in 1986. In contrast, Drexel's annual report for 1986 indicated that the firm earned $545.5 million, leading the industry.    Drexel officials have said in the past that a change in net worth was a good indication of the firm's performance. Yesterday, the spokeswoman stopped short of confirming the number, saying that net worth is affected by such items as withdrawals of equity by shareholders who leave the firm, and by reserves. She declined to give more details.    The 1987 report said revenue fell 20% to $3.2 billion from $4 billion. Total capital increased $318 million to $2.185 billion from $1.867 billion, including a net increase of $266 million in long-term borrowings.    Many industry professionals speculated after the stock market crash last October that Drexel took heavy trading losses because of the decline in value of junk bonds in which it makes markets. But the annual report said that &quot;our trading departments performed excellently.&quot;    Some officials of the firm have said that Drexel has set up large reserves to cover possible contingencies related to the investigation and that those reserves ate into profits.    Salomon Inc. posted the biggest percentage earnings drop among publicly held major Wall Street firms in 1987, falling 72% to $142 million from $516 million. Morgan Stanley posted the best performance, as earnings rose 15% to a record $230.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
