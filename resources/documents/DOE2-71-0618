<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-0618 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors studied by temperature and intensity dependence (130K to 300K)of photo- and dark conductivity in a series of low-gap a-Si, Ge:H,F alloys(E/sub opt/ = 1.25 to 1.33 eV) prepared under different deposition conditions.Electron time of flight experiments were conducted between 300K and 400K.Results reveal an increase in the slope of the exponential conductionband tail to -- 50 meV and a peak in electron trapping states at 0.3to 0.4 eV below the conduction band edge, leading to a transition fromextended to hopping conduction by electrons at slightly below room temperature.The alloys have midgap defect densities in the low 10/sup 17/cm/sup -3/V/sup-1/ range.</TEXT></DOC>
