Companies are beginning to cashoven, like bile acid resins and niacin,to thenew, like gemfibrozil and lovastatin can be useful, said Dr. WaynePeters, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Schoolof Medicine.   Lovastatin lowers the blood's low-density lipoprotein, whichdelivers the cholesterol that builds up in the arteries.Gemfibrozil increases the levels of high-density lipoprotein, whichcarries cholesterol away to be destroyed.   The two drugs ``are so easy to take, so impressive in theireffects on lowering cholesterol, that many physicians start outwith them first, which is not an NIH recommendation,'' Peters saidrecently in Dallas.   The National Institutes of Health has designated colestipol,cholestyramine and nicotinic acid, or niacin, as drugs of firstchoice. The first two are bile bile acid resins, which have beenbeen available for more than 20 years.   ``The two newer drugs can also be considered,'' said Peters.``But most cholesterol experts think they should only be consideredafter patients are using niacin and bile resins in small doses.''   Lovastatin was approved in 1987 by the Food and DrugAdministration.   It can be very effective, Willerson said. ``Lovastatin is a veryimportant medication, but the newer cholesterol-fighting drugs arevery powerful, and it is important to be aware of what the optionsare.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept. 8</NOTE></DOC>
