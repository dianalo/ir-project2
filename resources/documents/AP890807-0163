Yeutter also said the United States will continue to push forelimination of the barriers to fair agricultural trade around theworld.   In a speech to the U.S. Feed Grains Council, Yeutter said heexpects ``heavy debate'' on new federal farm legislation inFebruary and March, as Congress tries to approve a farm bill beforethe 1990 elections.   Yeutter said he disagrees with those who want the United Statesto limit farm production and sell less grain overseas. He saidthere will be 6.2 billion people in the world by the year 2000.   ``Somebody is going to feed those folks,'' said Yeutter. ``Ihope that somebody will include U.S. feed grain producers.'   He also said he opposes international agreements in whichexporting countries try to divide up markets and regulate prices.   ``I'd rather compete than negotiate market shares,'' he said.   Yeutter said U.S. officials attending the next round ofinternational trade negotiations will work for reform of policiesthat limit imports, subsidize exports and create high internalprice supports for farmers.   Such practices distort free trade, he said.   The European Community, for example, has reduced its imports ofcoarse grains from 20 million metric tons a year to 4 million tonsa year in 10 years, while its exports of grain have increased from5 million to 12 million tons, said Yeutter.   ``That's an enormous turn-around thanks to these exportsubsidies,'' he said. ``Let's phase out all the distortions ... andlet farmers compete.''   One approach, said Yeutter, would be to persuade nations toreplace all import constraints _ quotas, for example _ withtariffs, then work to gradually reduce them.   Until trade reform is accomplished, however, Yeutter said theUnited States will need to provide export subsidies to compete withother producers like the European Community.   Yeutter also said U.S. farmers will have to be more competitiveso that they can take advantage of foreign sales opportunities whentrade barriers are removed.   ``We better be ready to get them when the markets exist,'' saidYeutter.   During the meeting, Yeutter also announced that the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union will begin negotiations in December fora new, long-term grain agreement.   The current agreement provides that the Soviets will buy atleast 4 million metric tons each of U.S. wheat and corn annually,and make additional purchases of at least 1 million tons of wheat,corn, soybeans or soybean meal.   It also allows the Soviets to buy up to 3 million metric tons ofadditional wheat and corn without additional consultations.   The U.S. Feed Grains Council, a private organization of farm andagribusiness groups, was formed in 1960 to promote export marketsfor U.S. corn, barley and sorghum.   About 300 people are expected to attend the annual meeting,which concludes Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
