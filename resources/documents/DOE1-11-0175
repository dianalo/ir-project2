<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-11-0175 </DOCNO><TEXT>The active solar Domestic Hot Water (DHW) system at the Tucson Job CorpsCenter was designed and constructed as part of the Solar in Federal BuildingsProgram (SFBP). This retrofitted system is one of eight of the systemsin the SFBP selected for quality monitoring. The purpose of this monitoringeffort is to document the performance of quality state-of-the-art solarsystems in large Federal buildings. The systems are unique prototypes.Design errors and system faults discovered during the monitoring periodcould not always be corrected. Therefore, the aggregated overall performanceis often considerably below what might be expected had similar systemsbeen constructed consecutively with each repetition incorporating correctionsand improvements. The solar collector system is installed on a two storydormitory at the Job Corps Center. The solar system preheats hot waterfor about two hundred students. The solar system provided about 50% ofthe energy needed for water heating in the winter and nearly 100% ofthe water heating needs in the summer. There are about 70,000 gallonsof water used per month. There are seventy-nine L.O.F. panels or 1659square feet of collectors (1764 square feet before freeze damage occurred)mounted in two rows on the south facing roof. Collected solar energyis stored in the 2200-gallon storage tank. The control system is by JohnsonControls. City water is piped directly to the storage tank and is circulatedin the collectors. Freeze protection is provided by recirculation ofstorage water. There is an auxiliary gas fired boiler and 750 gallonDHW storage tank to provide backup for the solar system. Highlights ofthe performance monitoring from the solar collection system at the TucsonJob Corps Center during the November 1984 through July 1985 monitoringperiod are presented in this report.</TEXT></DOC>
