A federal judge asked jurors in the GAF Corp. stock manipulationcase to reconsider all evidence after they reported the splitfollowing more than 65 hours of deliberations.   The GAF case is the first trial based on the confessions ofinsider trader Ivan Boesky, which led to the indictment, and isconsidered a test of the government's ability to try Wall Streetcorruption.   ``Your honor. We need help. There are 11 jurors who have come toa unanimous decision on counts one through eight and one juror whodoes not agree,'' the jury reported in a note read in U.S. DistrictCourt in Manhattan.   The panel reported that the juror said ``under no circumstances''could he agree with the other jurors' decision.   GAF, two subsidiaries and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin arecharged with allegedly trying to boost the stock price of UnionCarbide Corp. in 1986 shortly before selling a large block ofshares. They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud andconspiracy among the eight counts.   Under an instruction known as the Allen charge, U.S. DistrictJudge Mary Johnson Lowe asked the jurors to reconsider theirpositions in the securities fraud case and sent them back todeliberate.   ``Before I declare a mistrial and discharge you I want to pointout a few things to you,'' Lowe said. ``It is desirable that if averdict can be reached that this be done.''   But Lowe told the jury that they should not reverse positionssolely to reach a verdict and left resolution to the ``conscientiousjudgment of each juror.''   After hearing the judge's statement, the jury said it wanted tocontinue deliberating Sunday afternoon.   The point of conflict among the jurors and whether the 11supported acquittal or conviction were not known.   A mistrial would be the second in the case. Lowe declared amistrial Jan. 10 after ruling that the prosecution unintentionallywithheld a key piece of evidence. The second trial lasted six weeks.   GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building materialsmanufacturer, faces a maximum fine of $12 million, or $500,000 oneach of the eight counts. Sherwin, 55, of Princeton, N.J., faces 40years in prison and a fine of up to $2 million.   The GAF case is being closely followed by Wall Street defenseattorneys as a key indication of prosecutors' ability to convincejuries of Wall Street crimes, and of the reliability of informationsupplied by Boesky, who is serving a three-year term on insidertrading charges.   The purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximizeGAF's profits from the planned sale of a large block of UnionCarbide stock after a failed takeover of the much larger chemicalconcern earlier in 1986.   GAF denied the charges in what became the first case to reach thetrial phase in a wave of Wall Street corruption investigations bythe Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.   The U.S. attorney's office has brought charges in more than 50securities fraud cases since 1983. Nearly all the claims, however,have involved civil charges. Criminal frauds to date, includingpending charges against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., have beensettled through plea bargains.   The government based its case on the testimony of Los Angelesbroker Boyd L. Jefferies, an admitted felon expected to play a keyrole in other securities fraud cases as part of a plea arrangementwith the government.</TEXT></DOC>
