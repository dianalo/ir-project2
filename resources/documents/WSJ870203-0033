The dollar tumbled despite statements by Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that the dollar's fall has reached a danger point and that further declines are likely to result in higher inflation. Volcker was speaking to the congressional Joint Economic Committee.    Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar hit a two-year high against its U.S. counterpart, extending a surge begun this winter that has been fueled partly by investor interest from Japan.    The U.S. unit began falling yesterday in Tokyo. Japanese exporters and speculators sought to sell the currency before it reversed Friday's sharp rise, which was spurred by news that the American trade deficit narrowed sharply in December.    In U.S. foreign-exchange trading yesterday, support for the dollar was further undercut by the Commerce Department's report that construction spending fell 0.5% in December, the second consecutive monthly decline. &quot;I think the market was looking for an up number, and we were too,&quot; said Joseph F. Teel, a trader at Fidelity Bank, Philadelphia.    The Canadian dollar continued to benefit as an alternative to the U.S. currency. Investors are attracted in part by the higher yields on many Canadian investments. &quot;There's a lot of money flowing into Canada from Japan,&quot; said John Flynn, executive vice president, foreign exchange, at Deak International, New York. &quot;I see the Canadian dollar appreciating another 2% to 3%,&quot; he added.    Individuals and institutions also are bidding up futures contracts for the Canadian dollar on the International Monetary Market in Chicago, said Christiane Mandell, economist at Barclays Bank International Ltd., New York. &quot;Now, everyone and his brother is catching on,&quot; she said. &quot;I feel there's more appreciation left there,&quot; she added.    In late New York trading yesterday, the Canadian dollar stood at 74.95 U.S. cents, up from 74.71 U.S. cents Friday. The U.S. unit fell 1.3% to 1.8090 West German marks, from 1.8328, and dropped 0.8% to 152.59 Japanese yen, from 153.75.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $4 an ounce to $401.10 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $402.25 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    CURRENCY RATES                          New York   Home Mkt.

One dollar now equals 240 zlotych, up from 200 previously.   The devaluation is meant to increase Polish exports bymaking them less expensive when bought with other currencies.In 1986, Poland's exports to hard-currency countries were$600 million below target. The International Monetary Fundand the World Bank have told Poland that a realistic exchangerate is needed to aid exports, Pap said.   ---   Japan's Reserves at Record   Special to The Wall Street Journal   TOKYO -- Japan's official reserves grew a record $9.22billion in January from the preceding month, to $51.46billion, the Finance Ministry said. January was the firstmonth in which the reserves, mainly convertible foreigncurrencies and gold, have been above $50 billion.
