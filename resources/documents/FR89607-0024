This gas, commonly called ``sour gas'' is ``sweetened'' byremoving the H<T2>2</T2>S from the natural gas in treatment plants before the naturalgas is introduced into the transmission pipelines. The Mary Ann Field inMobile Bay in Alabama produces natural gas averaging 7\1/2\ percent or75,000 parts per million (PPM) of H<T2>2</T2>S. At present, the federal gas pipeline safety regulations, 49 CFR Part 192,do not specifically address all the safety risks associated with the presenceof H<T2>2</T2>S in natural gas, such as those involving sulfide stress crackingand toxicity effects. Hydrogen sulfide is a toxic, colorless, flammable gas which is poisonous,if inhaled, especially at concentrations in excess of 300 PPM (\3/10\ of1 percent). Persons will lose consciousness after 5 minutes of breathingH<T2>2</T2>S at concentrations of 100 PPM and death results very quicklythereafter. Considerable research has been conducted to describe the effects of H<T2>2</T2>S on the sulfide stress cracking of line pipe and to additionallydescribe the effects of stress corrosion cracking mechanisms in line pipe[1]. Research has shown a substantial increase in threshold stress (stressbelow which H<T2>2</T2>S has no effect on sulfide stress cracking) with decreasing H<T2>2</T2>S concentration [2]. For H<T2>2</T2>S concentrations of 5 PPM or less there is no measurable effecton the sulfide stress cracking potential for high strength steel pipe.For high concentration of H<T2>2</T2>S (andgreater;3,000 PPM) and applied stress levels above 70 percentof the yield stress, the time to failure decreases dramatically [2, 3].<ITAG tagnum="84">Recent Incidents Reported by NTSB Involving Releases of H<T2>2</T2>S Into Gas Pipeline Systems </ITAG><T3>California. </T3>One incident [4] arose on December 28, 1983, whenthe Pacific Offshore Pipeline Company's (POPCO) Las Flores Canyon Gas TreatmentPlant was placed in service. Impurities, including H<T2>2</T2>S, were to be removed from producing wells in the Santa YnezUnit (an offshore field in the Santa Barbara Channel). The cleaned gaswould be delivered by pipeline to the Las Flores Canyon Gas Treatment Plantwhere POPCO would then deliver it to the Southern California Gas Company(SCG) system for distribution to its natural gas customers. Due to the failure of an automatic gas analyzer, gas was contaminated by200 PPM of H<T2>2</T2>S and entered the SCG distribution system. The analyzer was repairedfollowing the interruption of gas flow. After the gas flow was re-initiated,further analysis indicated 16 PPM H<T2>2</T2>S in the gas stream and flow was again stopped. The OccupationalSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations limit long term exposurelevels of people to H<T2>2</T2>S at 10 PPM. This introduction of H<T2>2</T2>S into the SCG distribution system resulted in a notificationof evacuation for over 20,000 people. A second incident [4] involving H<T2>2</T2>S entering the SCG system occurred on May 12, 1984, at the Wilmington,California, gas delivery point. Following this incident, the CaliforniaPublic Utilities Commission (PUC) requested that all SCG locations thatcould receive contaminated gas be equipped with automatic H<T2>2</T2>S analyzers and shut-off equipment. The shut-off concentrationwould be set at between 4 PPM and 10 PPM. As a result of these incidents in California, the California PUC has requiredthat its previously determined upper limit be monitored by automatic equipmenton a daily basis at gas supply points. <T3>Texas. </T3>On August 11, 1987, automatic H<T2>2</T2>S monitoring equipment at the KG Gas Processors, Limited, gasprocessing plant near Winters, Texas, indicated that an excessive amountof H<T2>2</T2>S was entering the gas stream being delivered to Lone Star GasCompany [4]. The supply was shut off and attempts to contact Lone Starpersonnel were initiated. Although no new contaminated gas was enteringthe Lone Star system, customer complaints were received triggering actionsby Lone Star to analyze the gas. Gas company personnel found H<T2>2</T2>S in concentrations of 1,600 PPM and greater and purged the entiresystem. The excessive concentrations of H<T2>2</T2>S were not detected because automatic shut-off equipment at KGhad failed to operate in response to the automatic monitor and Lone Star'smonitoring equipment had been removed for repair at that time.Incidents Reported in Canada During a 25-year period, 22 instances have been reported [5] where workersat the Windfall sour gas field in Alberta, Canada, had been overcome byH<T2>2</T2>S vapors emanating from tanks that were being filled by sourcrude or gas condensates. Because H<T2>2</T2>S is heavier than air, it will flow out of the top opening orvent line from tanks and in still air will accumulate in dangerous concentrationsnear ground level. Such an occurrence could be extremely hazardous if apipeline carrying H<T2>2</T2>S ruptured in a Class 3 or 4 location. <ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)</ITAG>Current federal regulations in 49 CFR Part 192 do not require gas contentand quality monitoring. Additionally, the RSPA gas incident reporting criteria(49 CFR 191.3) do not specifically require that events such as the preceding[4,5] be reported. Therefore, the full extent of the problems associatedwith H<T2>2</T2>S in pipelines is not known. However, from its review of LoneStar's records, NTSB found that since 1977, 11 incidents involving therelease of excessive quantities of H<T2>2</T2>S into its pipeline system had occurred. In consideration ofthe potential for serious injury or death following the release of H<T2>2</T2>S and resultant human exposure, the NTSB recommended that RSPA:(1) Establish, based on known toxicological data, a maximum allowable concentrationof hydrogen sulfide in natural gas pipeline systems, and amend 49 CFR Part192 to reflect this determination. (Class II, Priority Action) (P-88-1)(2) Revise 49 CFR Part 191 to require that pipeline operators report allincidents in which concentrations of hydrogen sulfide in excess of themaximum allowable concentration are introduced into pipeline systems thattransport natural gas intended for domestic or commercial purposes. (ClassIII, Longer-Term Action) (P-88-2) (3) Require gas pipeline operators to install on their systems equipmentcapable of automatically detecting and shutting off the flow of gas whenthe maximum allowable concentrations of hydrogen sulfide-contaminated gasare exceeded. (Class III, Longer-Term Action) (P-88-3) <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>Generally speaking, operators of natural gas pipelines do not monitor gasquality at the custody transfer point. The producer is ordinarily contractuallyobligated to supply gas of a specified quality (moisture content, H<T2>2</T2>S, elemental sulfur, BTU content, etc.). Gas quality monitoringis therefore the responsibility of the producer. At present, it is notclear how many operators monitor gas quality. In the case of the Las FloresCanyon Gas Treatment Plant supplying SCG, both producer and operator hadgas monitoring and alarm systems. H<T2>2</T2>S poses risks to both health [6] and to the integrity of pipelinestructures [1,2,3]. H<T2>2</T2>S is a toxic, colorless, flammable gas which is poisonous ifinhaled. It is considered to be immediately dangerous to life and healthat concentrations of 300 PPM and at concentrations of 1,000 PPM it causesimmediate unconsciousness and death. The OSHA has established an upperconcentration level of l0 PPM for prolonged (8 hours) workplace exposureto H<T2>2</T2>S. The effects of H<T2>2</T2>S on pipe metal depend to a large extent on pressure, steel chemistry,and duration of exposure [2,3]. Spontaneous cracking can be a problem evenat low concentrations if the H<T2>2</T2>S contamination is not eliminated. Conversely, if a high concentration(andgreater;3,000 PPM) of H<T2>2</T2>S is accidentally introduced into a transmission or distributionsystem operating at, for example, 72 percent of specified minimum yieldstrength, failure could occur in as little as 10 hours. The ratio of threshold stress (stress at which spontaneous cracking occurs)to yield stress is approximately 1.0 at an H<T2>2</T2>S concentration of 100 PPM for API 5LX-65 pipe steel. However,for an H<T2>2</T2>S concentration equal to or greater than 3,000 PPM, this ratiois about 0.7. The time to failure for API 5LX-65 pipe steel is a very sensitive functionof the applied stress to yield stress ratio from 100 percent of yield toabout 70 percent of yield for a concentration of H<T2>2</T2>S of 3,000 PPM. Below this level of applied stress, the timeto failure increases dramatically from 10 to 20 hours to well beyond athousand hours. It has also been shown that high yield strength and high hardness (RockwellC above 22) steels are more susceptible to sulfide stress cracking thanlower strength steels. Recent studies [7] have shown that the pH level of condensates in the pipelinemay be more important than the exact hydrogen sulfide level. Sulfide stresscracking tends to be enhanced at lower pH levels, especially in the presenceof CO<T2>2</T2>. In addition to sulfide stress cracking, hydrogen induced cracking or blisteringcan occur in the presence of H<T2>2</T2>S. This type of cracking is sometimes referred to as stepwisecracking. Hydrogen induced cracking can occur in the absence of stressand it occurs in time periods as short as a few days from initial exposure.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Existing Regulations </ITAG>1.

State Regulations <ITAG tagnum="81">California General Order 58 </ITAG>At present California is seeking to establish a maximum allowable levelof hydrogen sulfide in natural gas pipeline systems. The level to be proposedby General Order GO-58-A7 is set forth in Item 7, Purity of Gas, as follows:(a) Hydrogen Sulfide. No gas supplied by any gas utility for domestic,commercial, or industrial purposes in this state shall contain more thanone-fourth (0.25) grain of hydrogen sulfide per one hundred (100) standardcubic feet. (b) Total Sulfur. No gas supplied by any gas utility for domestic, commercial,or industrial purposes shall contain more than thirty (30) grains of totalsulfur per one hundred (100) standard cubic feet. (c) Test procedures used to determine the amounts of hydrogen sulfide andtotal sulfur shall be in accordance with accepted gas industry standardsand practices. <ITAG tagnum="81">Michigan Rule 299 </ITAG>The State of Michigan Department of Natural Resources, Geological SurveyDivision, Oil and Gas Operations, has a comprehensive set of regulationsentitled ``Hydrogen Sulfide Management.'' These regulations deal with definitions,set standards for equipment, establish duties of the well operator, definewhich wells are regulated, and define location of wells and processingequipment. In addition, the regulations establish training requirementsof personnel, contingency plans for drilling, drilling operations, andbriefing areas. In addition, Michigan has a detailed H<T2>2</T2>S Rules Supplement which further defines which class of welland associated gathering lines is affected by a particular rule or sectionof the rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Michigan Rule 460 </ITAG>The Michigan Department of Commerce, Public Service Commission, has establishedRule 460, ``Technical Standards for Gas Service.''

Rule 36 contains general provisions for determining the hydrogen sulfideconcentration in the gaseous mixture in an operations or system. It explainshow to determine the radius of exposure in terms of concentration as afunction of distance from the source. Storage tanks, warning markers, security,materials, and equipment selection requirements are all covered in thegeneral provisions section. The rule additionally provides guidance and regulations for contingencyand emergency preparedness. The rule provides a framework for appropriatefield operations, including inspection, drilling, training of personnel,accident notification, reporting requirements, and new well completionreporting of H<T2>2</T2>S concentration levels. 3. Canadian Regulations The Canadian Standard Z184-1975, ``Gas Pipeline Systems,'' contains a numberof provisions pertaining to sour gas service. Section 3.4 is entitled ``Requirementsfor Sour Gas Service.'' This section sets forth special service requirementsfor piping and all components in contact with sour gas. Section 4.10, ``Inspection and Testing of Production Welds,'' includesa subsection 4.l0.2.1.4 which requires that all welds in a sour gas systemshall be radiographically inspected for 100 percent of the circumference.Section 4.11.3.3 requires that there be <T3>no</T3> area of inadequate penetration or incomplete fusion betweenthe root bead and pipe metal on welds in sour gas systems. Section 4.11.4.4, ``Welds in Sour Gas Systems.'' This section requiresthat welds be free of unrepaired burn-through. Section 4.11.8.4 requires that there be no undercutting adjacent to theroot bead on welds in sour gas systems. Section 6.4.8.1.2 permits testing with sour gas only in remote Class 1locations when other test media are not available. Section 6.4.5.1(c)_suitable measures shall be taken to prevent failuresdue to such mechanisms as metal loss corrosion, hydrogen embrittlement,stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen blistering [in sour gas systems],and provisions shall be made for monitoring stations to assess internalcorrosion. <ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Information </ITAG>Since RSPA has no regulations regarding maximum H<T2>2</T2>S concentration in gas pipeline systems (other than gas holdersand copper pipeline), RSPA would like to have additional information toappropriately assess the need for establishing such regulations. To assist RSPA in evaluating the need for additional regulations, interestedparties are invited to answer the following questions and submit relevantinformation including any accident experience (if applicable) associatedwith H<T2>2</T2>S release(s). (1) What factors should be considered in determining the need for a maximumallowable concentration of hydrogen sulfide in natural gas pipeline systems?What should this concentration be? (2) Describe events you know of in which hydrogen sulfide has been releasedfrom, or into, a pipeline in dangerous amounts and what were the H<T2>2</T2>S concentrations? What were the consequences of such releases?What would be the burden associated with mandatory reporting of such events?(3) If you are an operator receiving gas from a producer, do you have automaticH<T2>2</T2>S detection and shut-off equipment? Do these devices operatereliably? For such operators that do not have this equipment, what costsand other burdens can be associated with requiring use of the equipment?(4) Which pipelines transporting sour gas should be subject to an H<T2>2</T2>S monitoring requirement? Should rural gas gathering lines besubject to H<T2>2</T2>S monitoring requirements, even though they are not now subjectto any of the Part 192 safety standards? Commenters are not limited to filing comments only on the questions presentedabove and may submit any facts and views consistent with the intent ofthis advance notice. In addition, commenters are encouraged to providecomments on (1) ``major rule'' considerations under the terms of ExecutiveOrder 12291; (2) ``significant rule considerations'' under the terms ofDOT regulatory procedures (44 FR 11634); (3) potential environmental impactssubject to the National Environmental Policy Act; (4) information collectionburdens that must be reviewed under the Paperwork Reduction Act; (5) theeconomic impact on small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act;and (6) impacts on Federalism under Executive Order 12612.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 49 App. U.S.C. 1672 and 1804; 49 CFR 1.53; AppendixA of Part 1, and App. A of Part 106.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on June 1, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard L.
