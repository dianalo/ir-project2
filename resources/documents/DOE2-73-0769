Theactions of interception, for fiber particles, and cloud-settling, forconcentrated cigarette smoke, can enhance focal deposition in locationsthat would not have been anticipated for dilute aerosols or for more-regularlyshaped, sphere-like particles. It is important to quantitate the efficienciesof these deposition mechanisms because it is after deposition that deleteriousbiological effects can occur. Theoretical deposition models are presentedthat simulate the actions of the interception and cloud-settling processes,which are validated by comparisons with in vitro and in vivo data. Thesites of preferential deposition are regions whose cells receive increaseddoses of hazardous substances associated with smokes and fibers. Theymust, therefore, be considered in risk-assessment analyses of human inhalationexposures to airborne toxicants. Incorporation of these mechanisms inaerosol-therapy protocols could conceivably lead to improved therapeuticprocedures.</TEXT></DOC>
