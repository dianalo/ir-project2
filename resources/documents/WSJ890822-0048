The bodies of Jose Enrique Menendez, 45 years old, and his wife, Kitty, 44, were discovered by the couple's two sons, who then called police.    Craig Harvey, an investigator in the Los Angeles County Coroner's office, said police investigators found the bodies on a couch with &quot;multiple gunshots&quot; to their heads and torsos. &quot;My gut feeling is it was a {professional} hit,&quot; said Mr. Harvey. &quot;There are seldom multiple gunshots in a burglary.&quot;    Mr. Harvey added that there &quot;weren't any signs of a burglary,&quot; but said a motive for the apparent double homicide isn't known. Police said it was too early to say whether the crime was in any way related to business ventures. Just two months ago Live completed the acquisition of an audio and video retailing chain that was owned by a man the Federal Bureau of Investigation has alleged has ties to organized crime figures.    Late yesterday Peter Hoffman, president and chief executive of Carolco Pictures Inc., which holds a 49% stake in Live was named acting chairman and chief executive of Live. Roger R. Smith, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Live, was named acting president.    Mr. Menendez was recruited by Mr. Hoffman three years ago to operate International Video Entertainment Inc., an ailing home entertainment software concern in which Carolco had a stake. Mr. Menendez, who was Cuban born, had previously worked at RCA Corp. for 14 years and was an executive vice president in the company's Hertz Corp. unit and in its RCA/Ariola record unit. He had also worked as an accountant at Coopers andamp; Lybrand.    Mr. Menendez made sharp cuts in staff at International Video and returned the company to profitability. Two years ago, the company acquired Lieberman Enterprises Inc., a Minneapolis-based distributor of recorded music, videocassettes and computer software, and the combined company was named Live Entertainment. &quot;He was one of the strongest, most charismatic people you could have leading a company,&quot; said Lisbeth Barron, an analyst at McKinley Allsopp Inc.    In June, Live completed its $40.5 million acquisition of BeckZack Corp. of Milford, Mass., which owns the 81-store Strawberries audio and home-video retailing chain in the Northeast. Live purchased the company from Morris Levy. Mr. Levy was convicted in May 1988 of conspiring to extort payments from a record wholesaler.    An FBI affidavit in that case in federal court in Camden, N.J., called Mr. Levy &quot;a lucrative source of cash and property for leaders of the Genovese&quot; crime family. Mr. Levy, through his lawyer has denied any connection to organized crime. Yesterday, his lawyer couldn't be reached for comment.    However, Mr. Smith at Live Entertainment, said, &quot;I would urge you not to draw any connection between this bizarre incident and Mr. Levy. There is no logical connection.&quot; Mr. Smith said that in negotiations for the sale, Mr. Levy had appeared to be &quot;a very happy man.&quot; He added, that the shootings of Mr. Menendez and his wife are &quot;in the category of meaningless, unexplained things. We may find out {whoever did it had} the wrong house.&quot;    Under Mr. Menendez, Live Entertainment has experienced a sharp turnaround and its stock has climbed from a low of about $6 a share, after adjustment for a stock split, to a recent level of about $25 a share. Trading in the stock was halted yesterday pending announcement of the death of Mr. Menendez. When it resumed, the shares fell $2.50 to close at $18.50 each in national over-the-counter trading.    The stock of Carolco fell 50 cents to $9.75 each in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Early in the day Carolco reported sharply lower second-quarter earnings but said it was &quot;looking forward to an important contribution&quot; in the future from Live. Carolco finances, produces and leases movies, including several Sylvester Stallone films such as &quot;Rambo III.&quot;    Mr. Hoffman said he doesn't expect the death of Mr. Menendez to hurt the operations of either of the two companies. &quot;It's an awful, terrible loss, but it won't effect the company,&quot; said Mr. Hoffman. &quot;We'll get through it.&quot;    Mr. Smith noted that each of the three divisions of Live Entertainment has its own executive at the helm. </TEXT></DOC>
