(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Buddy Roemer said Friday he cannotaccept a Pardon Board's recommendation of a six-month sentence fora convicted killer who escaped from prison 18 years ago and built anew life in Tennessee.   Henry Staggs, who fled from a state prison at DeQuincy insouthwestern Louisiana in 1970, wound up in Columbia, Tenn., wherehe operated an auto repair ship as Douglas Gillette.   His freedom ended Feb. 5 when FBI agents arrested him.   When he escaped, Staggs had been serving a 15-year sentence formanslaughter in the 1969 shooting death of a nightclub bouncer inPort Allen, across the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge.   The Pardon Board recommended the six-month sentence and fiveyears of supervised parole for Staggs, 41, who is free on bond inTennessee.   Roemer, who can either accept or reject the board'srecommendation, said Friday that he had returned the case to theboard.   ``I was not comfortable with their recommendation, just speakingvery bluntly. A human life was taken, an escape from prison wasinvolved,'' he said. ``That was offset in part from apparent goodbehavior over time. I say apparent. Who knows? But I was not happywith the decision and have returned it to the board for anotherlook.''   The governor did not indicate what recommendation he wouldaccept, saying he would work with the Pardon Board.   During a Pardon Board hearing, Staggs said he remembered almostnothing of the killing of George Ballas. He blamed the shooting onalcoholism that developed while he served in the Army in the 1960s.   Staggs said he decided to escape after learning of his father'sdeclining health in his home state of Tennessee.   His wife, Bridget, said she knew nothing of his past until hisarrest. She said he was dedicated to her and their three children.   The Pardon Board received letters and petitions from about 2,000Tennessee residents asking that Staggs be allowed to remain free.</TEXT></DOC>
