Thousands of riot police firing volleys of tear gas fought offattacking students and pursued them in running clashes through thecenter of Seoul. Protesters showered police with explodingfirebombs that covered streets with blazing gasoline.   Hundreds of people out for walks choked and cried with pain whenthey were caught in clouds of stinging tear gas.   ``Down with the military fascists!'' and ``Revolution of themasses!'' the radicals screamed as they broke up sidewalk pavingstones to hurl at police.   The violence began when 10,000 students and sympathizers marchedthrough the city with the coffin of Park Rae-chun, who died June 6after setting himself on fire. It was the third protest suicide byradical students since May 15.   Marchers armed with firebombs, rocks and clubs tried to attackthe headquarters of the governing Democratic Justice Party duringthe march but were blocked by riot police in combat fatigues andblack helmets.   Protesters set fire to a police truck with firebombs and damagedthe information office of the Japanese Embassy with rocks. A numberof police and students were hurt and some protesters were arrested,but no figures were available.   Police reported the first death from the unrest. A riot trooperdied Sunday after being injured in fighting the day before in thecentral city of Taejon.   The wave of student protests is the nation's worst politicalviolence since anti-government riots in June 1987.   But unlike last summer, where pro-democracy demonstratorsenjoyed wide support from the masses, the radical studentsdemonstrating now represent a small minority. Most South Koreans donot support their demands for reunification of communist NorthKorea with the pro-Western South and the withdrawal from the Southof 42,000 U.S. troops.   Marchers shouted ``Yankee go home!'' on Sunday, but the protestwas less anti-American than other recent demonstrations. Marchersyelled slogans as they passed the U.S. Information Servicebuilding, but there were no incidents beyond one man hurling asoft-drink can.   Students wore red headbands with anti-government slogans andbeat drums and gongs as they marched through the city. The coffin,covered in yellow flowers, was carried by bearers in traditionalwhite mourning clothes.   The dead student belonged to a faction seeking creation of arevolutionary government.   Marchers began arming themselves with firebombs from a truckloaded with the weapons as the procession continued after a rallyin front of City Hall. Students wielding clubs, rocks and firebombswent to Democratic Justice Party headquarters where riot policeblocked the street.   They attacked police, who fired volleys of tear gas. Armoredvans with multiple tear gas launchers blasted protesters. Hundredsof riot police waiting in sidestreets poured out and quickly routedthe attackers.   Students at one point seized a highway overpass, but specialpolice martial arts squads hurling tear gas grenades attacked anddispersed them.   The protest was aimed mainly at the government of President RohTae-woo. Radical leaders denounced the government as a dictatorshipand called for creation of a peoples' republic.   ``We are here to fight for liberation of the masses,'' said oneleader.   The radical students have rejected democratic reforms made bythe Roh government in recent months, insisting the government is afront for dictatorial military rule.   They say the presence of the American troops, stationed hereunder a mutual defense pact, encourages military rule.   Some people watching the march expressed bewilderment and anger.   An elderly man, who yelled that students were not patriots,tried to attack marchers.   ``Why do these young people do this? What does it say about ourcountry,'' one middle-aged man said.</TEXT></DOC>
