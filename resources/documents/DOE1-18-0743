In order to explore possible reasonswhy this material is not a high-T/sub c/ superconductor, we carried outdetailed energy-band calculations. Even though the Cu-O network of La{sub4}BaCu{sub 5}O/sub 13-//sub x/ may be regarded as an array of one-dimensional(1D) strands, we find that the interstrand coupling is actually sufficientlystrong to make the band structure more nearly 3D than 1D in the neighborhoodof the Fermi level. Since the band structures of known high-T/sub c/copper-oxide superconductors have features which are distinctly 1D and/or2D, the absence of superconductivity in La{sub 4}BaCu{sub 5}O/sub 13-//subx/ might be due to the predominantly 3D band structure of samples studiedso far, for which xnot =0. Our studies suggest that nested 1D bands separatedby a reduced wave vector can be introduced on the Fermi surface by usingsamples with x = 0. If low dimensionality is indeed a significant factor,there is a chance that stoichiometric La{sub 4}BaCu{sub 5}O/sub 13/ couldalso be a high-T/sub c/ superconductor.</TEXT></DOC>
