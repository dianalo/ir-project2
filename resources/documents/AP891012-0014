SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States has more than 20 millionHispanic residents, the Census Bureau reports, meaning only fiveother countries have larger Latin American populations.   ``This is our first estimate of over 20 million,'' Jorge DelPinal, chief of the Ethnic and Hispanic Statistics Branch at thebureau, said Wednesday. ``It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980.''   Brazil has the largest Latin American population at more than147 million people.   The only other countries in this hemisphere with more Hispanicsthan the United States are: Mexico with 86.7 million; Argentina,31.9 million; Colombia, 31.2 million and Peru, 21.4 million.   The new Census analysis showed that as of last March Hispanicsconstituted 8.2 percent of the U.S. population and are the fastestgrowing large population group.   The bureau said immigration accounted for about half the growth.   About two-thirds of the Hispanics in the United States live injust three states. California leads with 34 percent, followed byTexas at 21 percent and New York with 10 percent.   Florida has 8 percent of the nation's Hispanics, and there aresignificant populations in Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, NewMexico and Colorado, the bureau reported.   Estimates are not prepared for every state because ``Hispanicsare not well spread out throughout the United States,'' Del Pinalsaid.   The Census report estimated the total Hispanic population of theUnited States at 20,076,000 as of March, up from 19,431,000 a yearearlier.   The largest segment is Mexicans at 12,567,000, followed bypeople of Central and South American origin, 2,545,000, PuertoRicans, 2,328,000, and Cubans, 1,068,000. The balance were ofSpanish or other Hispanic origin.   Mexicans were mostly concentrated in Texas and California, thereport said. Cubans are mostly in Florida, while Puerto Ricans tendto live in New York, and Central and South Americans are largely inCalifornia and New York.   While Mexicans were the largest group they are not the fastestgrowing, the report said.   Comparing the estimates for 1982 and 1989, the bureau saidCentral and South Americans had increased by 67 percent. The``other Hispanic'' category rose 31 percent, followed by Mexicans,up 30 percent, Puerto Ricans, 14 percent and Cubans, 12 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
