Klein</HL><DATE>10/14/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A10</SO><LP>   Dallas -- Oil brings wealth, but it does not foster amitybetween bordering states that have it. Witness Iran and Iraq,and Iraq and Kuwait. Also Texas and Oklahoma.   Among those examples, it's hard to say whose relations areworse. &quot;When you hear a Texan or an Oklahoman call each otherneighbor, it just means they share ownership in an oil well,&quot;Gary Cartwright, a writer from Texas, has written. &quot;They arelike tribes connected by a common hatred, two people who lookupon one another with the special loathing usually reservedfor cannibalism.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Fortunately for them, and for the world at large, Texasand Oklahoma (or, as the Sooners put it, Oklahoma and Texas)battle mainly on the football field, but the rivalry is noless intense for that. The universities bearing the names ofthe two states had it out for the 86th time here Saturday,with the underdog Longhorns prevailing, 10-7, under the sortof unusual circumstances that have come to be usual in theseries. The fray was staged at the usual place -- the CottonBowl here, which is roughly equidistant between the UT campusat Austin and OU's Norman home -- and before the usual fullhouse, described to me by one Texas native as &quot;75,000 people,all obnoxious.&quot;   I thought the tenor of the contest was best summed up by ascalper out front. She was offering a $30 ticket for $100,but with a caveat. &quot;If you're a Texas fan you don't want tobuy this,&quot; she said. &quot;It's in the Oklahoma section.&quot;   The winning play was not a pass or run, a field goal or,even, an extra point. It was a fumble recovery followed by a30-yard return, into the Oklahoma end zone, early in thefourth quarter. Its perpetrator was a defensive back namedBubba (no kidding) Jacques (pronounced Jacks, of course).He's a home-state boy, from Conroe.   Many of the Oklahoma players were from Texas, too -- 44 ofthe Sooners' current 93-man roster, to be exact -- and that'sone reason Texans don't like Oklahoma. They also don't likeit that Oklahoma rubs this in. &quot;Texas: A Great Supporter ofOU Football,&quot; headlines a story in the current Sooner mediaguide, which points out that 40 of the 92 Sooners who haveearned All-American honors hailed from the Lone Star state.   Texas produces enough football players to fill manyrosters, but it has been guilty of some piracy in return.Darrell Royal, adjudged UT's best coach ever during his1958-76 tenure, not only was an Oklahoma native, butquarterbacked the Sooners against the school he later wouldserve. Oklahomans weren't noticeably perturbed about that,though. They dislike Texas because it is bigger, richer, morepopulous and, in total volume, louder. &quot;If we win this game,it shuts 'em up for awhile,&quot; declared William Ossler, ared-clad OU booster, before Saturday's festivities.   The accent on noise is fitting, because OU-UT isn't justfootball, it's a multi-faceted event that includes manyopportunities for boisterousness. The first takes place indowntown Dallas on the game's eve. In the past, this verylarge gathering was a kind of civilian version of footballwithout helmets, in which ordinary folks got a chance toexchange whacks. But novel police tactics, like imposingone-way walking restrictions on downtown streets, has helpedput a damper on the rough stuff, and last Friday's editionwas described as good natured.   The fest continues Saturday morning at the Texas StateFair, which occupies the area immediately around the CottonBowl and of which the game is an annual part. Partisans ofboth teams roam the Midway, chomping corn dogs, swilling LoneStar and Dr Pepper, and gesturing at one another in variousfashions, usually being too pooped from the night before toholler much.   Inside the old stadium, whose seating is split 50-50between the schools, the fans revive, pitting patriotic hymnssuch as &quot;Boomer Sooner&quot; against &quot;The Eyes of Texas,&quot; inconsiderable volume. The uproar continues back on the Midwayafter the game, but by that time partisans of the loser tendto be come dispirited and slink off in search of quietervenues.   That this fate befell the Oklahomans on Saturday wasunexpected, mainly because the Sooners came here with a 4-0won-lost mark, to Texas's soggy 1-2, and a No. 6 nationalranking. Finally off a two-year NCAA probation, and withthird-year coach Gary Gibbs ordering his charges to throw theball with a frequency that has no doubt dismayed hispredecessor, Barry Switzer, the Sooners were bidding torecapture the glory that fled, along with Switzer, when theteam was penalized for behaving more like a motorcycle gangthan a band of collegians.   The Sooners lived up to their name early on, spending thebest part of the first half in Longhorn territory. They tooka 7-0 lead in the first quarter on a 24-yard touchdown passfrom quarterback Cale Gundy to flanker Ted Long, and offeredtheir field goal kicker, Scott Blanton, opportunities from32, 37 and 47 yards. Alas for OU, Blanton would miss themall.   Texas, meantime, mustered only one good first-half charge,in quarter two, but Jason Post made the field goal, from 30yards. That was to be about that for offense on both sides,as the Texas defense in particular stiffened. It did evenbetter in the last period, when tackle James Patton forcedSooner fullback Mike McKinley to fumble and Jacques, comingin from his safety position, scooped up the bouncing spheroidand carried it into the end zone. Subsequent Sooner thrustsdied amid quarterback sacks and incomplete passes.   The win was welcomed by Texas's fifth-season coach DavidMcWilliams, who, while not making Horns boosters forgetRoyal, at least has beaten OU these last three years, all onlate scores. Smiling, he later ascribed the win to threethings: &quot;Defense, defense and defense.&quot;   Hero Jacques grinned, too, in describing his winning play.&quot;The ball bounced once and I missed it, but it came back tome, like it was on a string,&quot; he said. His feeling when hesaw that his path to the end zone was clear, he added, was&quot;Woo]&quot;   And as Sooner backers will attest, &quot;Woo]&quot; spelledbackwards is &quot;Oow]&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
