(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A giant, 18-foot-long alligator is livingin Lake Okeechobee, boaters and fishermen claim, but a statewildlife expert says he doubts it.   ``It looks monstrous, bigger than our boat, and we have a19-footer,'' Rebecca Dunn, who has been fishing on the lake with herfishing-guide husband since 1966, said recently.   ``We see it all the time,'' said Mrs. Dunn, who said she believesthe alligator is a female. ``She throws her food up in the air, wayup, then catches and eats it, mostly fish and birds.''   Mrs. Dunn has named the alligator Hendrietta, for Hendry County,one of five counties surrounding Lake Okeechobee, which is about 100miles northwest of Miami and at 700 square miles is Florida'slargest lake.   Bass fisherman Sonny Pease said he saw the creature sunningitself on shore with its tail curled around itself like LadyGodiva's hair.   Pease said that when he took his boat closer to the gator, hekept repeating, ``Oh, my God, that alligator is long. Nobody's goingto believe this.''   When he got within about 200 yards of the big reptile, it startedswimming toward his 18-foot boat.   It ``was all of my boat's size,'' Pease recalled.   An 18-foot alligator would break Florida's longest alligatorrecord by nearly 4 feet.   However, wildlife biologist Mike Jennings of the state Game andFresh Water Fish Commission in Gainesville said an 18-foot-longalligator would be highly improbable.   The longest gator caught since records were first kept in 1977measured just over 14 feet and weighed 714 pounds, and was trappedlast month in the Apalachicola River southwest of Tallahassee.Trappers estimated it was 100 years old.   The heaviest gator, caught in April near Gainesville, weighed1,043 pounds and was 13 feet long. It took a tow truck to lift itand three scales to weigh it.   ``That was a very healthy gator,'' Jennings said. ``I would'vequestioned it, if I hadn't seen it myself.''   The giant gator's real length may be determined after Sept. 1,when Florida's monthlong alligator season starts.   ``Every hunter who has a permit will be going for him,'' saidPease's 22-year-old son, Keith.</TEXT></DOC>
