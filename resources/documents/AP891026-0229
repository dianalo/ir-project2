Havens, assistantcomptroller general.   Testifying Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee, Havensinserted the GAO, Congress' auditing and investigative agency, intoa contentious dispute between bank regulators over the government'skey financial standard ensuring the safety of the nation's 13,000commercial banks.   Comptroller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke, a TreasuryDepartment official who regulates nationally chartered banks, isproposing a new capital standard that the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which insures deposits at both state and national banks,says is too low.   Capital, representing the investment of bank stockholders,serves as a cushion, absorbing losses before federal depositinsurance kicks in. Financial institutions with low capital levelsare more inclined to make risky investments because their ownershave less to lose. The crisis in the Sandamp;L industry was blamed inpart on regulatory moves in the early 1980s to relax capital rules.   Both the FDIC and Clarke's office have agreed to a risk-adjustedstandard starting in 1991, which would apply a more lenient test tobanks holding safer investments such as home mortgages andgovernment securities. However, they disagree over a backupstandard known as a ``leverage ratio.''   Clarke is proposing, but has not yet implemented, a 3 percentleverage ratio. FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman is pushing formore than that, preferably 6 percent.   He maintains that Clarke's proposal would permit nearly 10,000banks to reduce their capital by a total of $8 billion. Clarke,however, said Seidman's proposal would negate the beneficialeffects of risk-adjustments.   ``Now is not the time to be reducing capital standards. Thebanking business is an increasingly volatile one,'' Seidman said,noting bank problems in real estate lending and in loans to ThirdWorld countries.   Havens of the GAO agreed, saying, ``Adequate capitalization isthe first line of defense of any financial institution. Anyproposal that could yield a reduction in that capitalization shouldbe viewed with great caution.''   The disagreement among regulators raises the prospect that morelenient standards will apply to the 4,250 national banks regulatedby Clarke than to the 7,650 state banks for which Seidman writesthe capital rules.   Manuel H. Johnson, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,which sets the capital standards for about 1,100 state banks thatare members of its system, said the Fed has not yet taken a formalposition on the issue but believes the regulations should beuniform for all banks.   ``If we're not able to agree, I think Congress will have to getin and decide it for us,'' Seidman said.   Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate BankingCommittee, declined to reveal a position, saying he expected theregulators would be able to reach a consensus.</TEXT></DOC>
