Gen. Henri Namphy shreddedHaiti's popular Constitution and dealt a major blow to thecountry's move toward democracy.   Namphy said in a live television broadcast Friday night from thePresidential Palace that a new constitution will be written soon.He said the one approved by a massive voter turnout in March 1987was ``unhappily written and ratified in a climate of passion andemotion.''   ``It is obviously illusory to think of the full enjoyment ofrights and liberties in the context of absolute poverty in whichnearly 70 percent of the population in the country is vegetating,''Namphy said.   ``The future depends on what we do, or refuse to do now,'' hesaid, adding that the new constitution will take ``Haitian realityinto account.''   Namphy pledged his government would respect freedom of speechand assembly and the right to participate in labor unions andpolitical parties.   Port-au-Prince remained calm late Friday night, as it was afterthe June 19 coup that sent President Leslie Manigat into exile.   Namphy said the current constitution _ the most liberal inHaiti's 184-year history and ardently defended by civic andpolitical groups _ introduced foreign elements to Haitiantraditions.   The constitution, approved by 99 percent of Haitians who votedin a March 29, 1987 referendum, prohibited close Duvaliercollaborators from running for public office for a period of 10years. It also provided for an independent Electoral Council toorganize national elections.   During the 20-minute speech, Namphy was flanked by Manigat'sCabinet ministers and top aides to former dictators Jean-ClaudeDuvalier and his father Francois Duvalier.   After Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in 1986, Namphy ruleduntil Manigat's inauguration last February, a period tainted byarmy killings of peasants, demonstrators and opposition leaders.   On Nov. 29, 1987, Duvalierists shot and hacked to death at least34 voters while soldiers looked on and in some cases escorted thegunmen. The same day Namphy dissolved the independent ElectoralCouncil, then hand-picked another council, which ran thefraud-riddled January vote resulting in Manigat's election.   Namphy spoke in the same Hall of Busts where Manigat had heldhis three monthly news conferences. The entire High Command of theHaitian military was present, including Col. Jean-Claude Paul,indicted earlier this year by a federal grand jury in Miami oncharges on drug smuggling.   Sitting in the front row among the invited guests were threeformer presidential candidates, Francois Latortue, GerardPhillipe-Auguste _ Manigat's minister of agriculture _ and GregoireEugene, now Namphy's adviser on constitutional law.   Also present were two Duvalier supporters who had been rejectedas presidential candidates by the former independent ElectoralCouncil, Claude Raymond and Clovis Desinor.   Asked if he thought the new constitution would promote democracyin Haiti, Philippe-Auguste responded: ``Democracy is one thing, aconstitution is another. ... All depends on whether the law,written or unwritten, is obeyed.''   Eugene insisted that civil liberties would be respected underthe new constitution. He said he opposed the constitutionalprovision banning Duvalier suporters from running for office.   ``I think it is better to let the people decide for themselveswhether they want to vote for former Duvalierists,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
