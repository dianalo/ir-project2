All were GH deficient. Four of the patients withno GH response during insulin tolerance tests (ITT) showed increasedGH in response to synthetic human growth hormone releasing factor (GRF-44).Four patients had impaired cortisol responses to ITT, and gradual butdiminished cortisol responses to ovine corticotrophin releasing factor(CRF-41). There was no significant difference between mean peak incrementsin response to ITT and those in response to CRF-41. TSH responses toTRH were delayed in five and absent in two patients; four of these hadlow free T4 index. Prolactin was raised in all seven women and increasedfurther in response to TRH. Two patients had impaired gonadotrophin responsesto LHRH. None of the patients had clinical or biochemical evidence ofdiabetes insipidus. These data suggest that post-irradiation hypopituitarismin these patients results from radiation damage to the hypothalamus leadingto varying degrees of deficiency of the hypothalamic releasing or inhibitoryfactors.</TEXT></DOC>
