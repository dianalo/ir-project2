In an unusual move last week, the SEC suspended all redemptions, or investor withdrawals, on the ground that the $56 million fund hadn't registered its shares in some states, as required. The agency said this would expose the Valley Forge, Pa.-based fund to undetermined liabilities for registration fees and penalties, making it difficult to assess the net asset value of its shares.    But the SEC said the fund's management and investment adviser had taken sufficient steps to determine the net asset value of its shares. </TEXT></DOC>
