UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf _ who helped lead last year'sill-fated buyout deal _ issued a statement saying the board wouldconsider the offer, which shattered a lull in the maneuvering forthe parent of United Airlines.   The outcome could help determine the shape of takeovers in thetight-money atmosphere that has prevailed since the collapse of theearlier $6.8 billion deal, which contributed to a plunge in thestock market and raised some of the biggest doubts about the futureof the corporate merger craze of the 1980s.   Airline analysts said financing for the new bid could be aproblem. The depression in the junk-bond market and demise of itspioneer Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., formerly a leading source oftakeover financing, also could present major obstacles.   Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm that owns 11.8percent of UAL's approximately 21.8 million shares outstanding,disclosed the plan with the United pilots, machinists and flightattendants unions. United is the nation's second-largest airlineafter American Airlines.   Coniston said the group plans to lobby shareholders for theirproxy votes in favor of electing a new slate of directors at UAL'sannual meeting April 26.   If they are successful, the new directors will push foraccepting the Coniston-union takeover, which will give UAL'semployees _ including nonunion workers _ 75 percent ownership ofthe company.   The plan would pay stockholders $150 in cash and $25 insecurities, plus non-voting common stock amounting to 25 percent ofthe total in the company, for each of their shares.   Based on UAL's 21.8 million shares outstanding, the offer wouldbe worth about $3.8 billion.   UAL stock rose $12 to $154.50 a share Monday in New York StockExchange composite trading. The shares have recently traded as lowas $121.   Keith Gollust, one of Coniston's three principal partners, saidin a telephone interview that they were undertaking the proxy fightbecause UAL's board was moving too slowly on Coniston'slongstanding demand that the company be sold or restructured.   ``Our decision to nominate a slate of directors in opposition tothe incumbents was based on our disappointment that the board wasunable to produce another transaction,'' he said.   Wolf's statement said UAL's board would consider the offercarefully and meet to discuss it along with unspecifiedalternatives for raising the value of UAL shares. No meeting datewas announced.   It was unclear how Coniston and the unions intended to financethe takeover. They said the deal would include new laboragreements, such as no-strike commitments, and ``result insubstantial labor cost savings.''   Airline analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. said thegroup's ability to obtain financing was the key to their plan.   ``It's going to be hard for them to win a proxy fight unlessthey can show the shareholders they've got some financial clout,''Murphy said.   But Jack Hunter, an airlines analyst with Howe BarnesInvestments Inc., said UAL owns about 240 airplanes, more than halfof United's fleet, that could be used as collateral to secure alarge enough loan for the proposed deal. Hunter estimated theplanes are worth $4 billion.   He predicted UAL's board would agree to a buyout and avoid aproxy fight.   ``I don't think there's going to be a war,'' Hunter said. ``Ithink the board is ready to get out of this.''   UAL has been in a takeover target since early last August, whenLos Angeles investor Marvin Davis offered $4.3 billion for thecompany. The pilot-management coalition eventually won a deal withits $300 a share, $6.8 billion offer.   The Oct. 13 collapse of that offer, which was to be financedlargely with borrowed money, was considered one of the major eventsin the era of corporate takeovers because it helped instill deepskepticism about whether such deals would continue. The Dow Jonesindustrial average plunged 190 points that day.   The subsequent slump of the market for high-interest junk bondswidely used to finance buyouts helped curb the takeover frenzy.Airline acquisitions in particular have been considered riskybecause of uncertainties about the economy and health of theairline industry.   In January, the three unions proposed an employee purchase of 75percent of UAL and the board instructed its advisers to help theunions put together a formal bid.   The relationship soured when the union group indicated itplanned to dump Wolf. The chairman has taken a hard line in labornegotiations and would have received $76 million in cash and a 10percent stake in UAL as part of last year's failed bid.   Coniston's buyout plan mirrors the firm's attack on UALpredecessor Allegis Corp. in 1987. The firm acquired a stake inAllegis and threatened to mount a takeover if the company did notdivest its non-airline businesses, which Coniston believed werehindering corporate earnings and depressing the value of itsshareholdings.   Allegis ended up selling its Hertz car rental, Westin Hotel Co.,and Hilton International chains and renaming itself UAL.</TEXT></DOC>
