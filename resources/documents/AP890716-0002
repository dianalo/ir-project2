(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most union miners in Appalachia decided toreturn to work with their Midwestern and Southern colleagues Sunday,but many stayed out of the West Virginia coal fields where wildcatstrikes began last month.   Many United Mine Workers locals met Sunday and voted to heedunion President Richard Trumka's request that the miners return towork. In southern West Virginia, however, union officials said therewere enough disgruntled miners to disrupt the coal fields again.   ``Man, they're upset,'' said Danny Wells, a district boardrepresentative in UMW District 17, the nation's largest with 6,000miners. ``They are just upset with Trumka's call. They feel that'snothing been won yet.''   Angry miners began setting up wildcat pickets about 11 p.m. atmine sites throughout Logan County.   Wildcat walkouts by as many as 46,000 miners supporting 1,900striking Pittston Coal Group workers have idled much of the nation'scoal production since June 12. The number of wildcat strikers fellto 37,000 by the start of a union-sanctioned work stoppage last week.   UMW President Richard Trumka on Friday called an end to thefive-day, contract-sanctioned stoppage and asked the miners toreturn to work.   About 16,000 miners _ all the miners in Alabama, Illinois andIndiana and some in Kentucky _ were expected to return for theirnext scheduled shifts.   Union leaders in Pennsylvania said Sunday they believed the 7,500miners in their state would return by Monday.   That put pressure on miners in West Virginia, Ohio and Tennesseebecause the protest had become a nationwide action, Wells saidSunday. ``It would have to be nationwide to be successful,'' he said.   With the loss of support elsewhere, it would not be wise to adopta strategy different from that at the UMW's national headquarters inWashington, Wells said.   ``You've got to have a leader, and everybody can't lead,'' hesaid.   In southeast Ohio, at least 700 striking coal miners planned toreturn to work Monday and Tuesday, then resume observing acontract-sanctioned stoppage Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, saidCharles Greer, president of a UMW local in New Lexington.   Trumka ``ordered us back and we're going back,'' Greer said aftera meeting in Reinersville of about 600 miners Sunday night.   In UMW District 19 in southeastern Kentucky and northeasternTennessee, about 950 miners were expected to return to work earlyMonday, said district board member Cecil Michael Partin.   Some of the miners in that district returned to work Sunday toinspect mines in preparation for a return to work, Partin said. Hesaid that was a good indication that other miners in the districtwould report Monday.   In District 30 in eastern Kentucky, UMW local spokesman TerryVarney, who attended a meeting Saturday of district and localofficials, said Sunday he was fairly confident miners would returnto work.   In Madison, about 25 miles south of Charleston, UMW District 17officials met Saturday with more than 400 local presidents andmembers but were unable to persuade everyone to cease the wildcatstrikes, which began in West Virginia. A federal judge has orderedthe union to put an end to wildcat strike activities.   The miners were protesting Pittston's failure to sign a contractthat prohibits Sunday work and mandatory overtime and guaranteesfull medical benefits for pensioners. The 1,900 Pittston miners allwork in Kentucky, Virginia or West Virginia.   Wildcat strikers also have been upset that UMW members andsupporters have been arrested, jailed and fined for civildisobedience in the coal fields.   On Friday, U.S. District Judge Glen Williams asked Trumka andPittston president Paul Douglas to meet with him. Many of the minerssaw this as a break for the union and Williams' request seemed toease hostility on the lines.   Meanwhile, several coal companies said they can't meet orders dueto the strike.   Westmoreland Coal Co. of Philadelphia says it has told 11 foreigncustomers that it will not be able to make coal shipments totaling474,041 tons, at a price of about $40 a ton.   Island Creek Corp. of Lexington, Ky., said it also is havingtrouble filling orders. The company said that it may fail to meetobligations ranging from 500,000 to 2 million tons if the strikescontinue.</TEXT></DOC>
