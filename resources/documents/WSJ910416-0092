Proposed Internal Revenue Service rules allow fortraditional pension or profit-sharing plans to be replaced byprofit-sharing plans weighted to favor older employees,including owner-employees of many small firms. The IRS hasn'tyet issued final rules, but pension experts expect the changeto be adopted, and some are advising clients to proceed nowwith age-weighted plans.   Traditionally, profit-sharing contributions have beenbased on each employee's pay level, with no considerationgiven to age. In age-weighted plans, an employer'sprofit-sharing payment for the youngest workers may equal aslittle as 3% of their pay, while that for the oldest workersmay equal as much as 25% of pay (though never more than$30,000).   David I. Gensler, president of Madison Pension Services, aconsulting firm in White Plains, N.Y., says age-weightedplans will enable some owners to save money by cuttingprofit-sharing payments for younger employees whilemaintaining maximum benefits for themselves.   Under the old rules, he says, nondiscrimination provisionsstrongly discouraged favored treatment -- other thanweighting by salary -- for employee-owners. But inage-weighted plans, owners also can get favored treatment ifthey are among the oldest workers in a profit-sharing plan.   In setting up its first profit-sharing plan recently,Itsnu Industries, a New York garment firm, chose theage-weighted approach. &quot;My partner and I are at least 25years older than everybody else, so we decided that thepayments should be based on age,&quot; says Leonard Bergman.   According to Mr. Gensler, who advises Itsnu, Mr. Bergmanand his partner can each get $30,000 annually incompany-funded profit-sharing contributions. That may workout to as much as 79% of the company's total annual fundingof the plan. Under a traditional approach to profit sharing,he says, the two owners would get only 42% of total funding.                                                                                                          Dealers' Children Get   Training From Suppliers                                                                                                          BIG COMPANIES move to strengthen the next generation ofindependent dealers.   Airco Distributor Gases, a Murray Hill, N.J., unit ofBritain's BOC Group, late last year held a tuition-freefive-day seminar aimed at increasing the financial andhuman-relations abilities of 26 sons and daughters of Aircodistributors. A similar seminar is planned for this year.   The owners of some Airco gas distributorships areapproaching retirement, and &quot;we want to see these businessesremain independent,&quot; says F. Dale Hayes, director ofmarketing for Airco. He says small, independent companieshave the greatest motivation to help make Airco sales grow.   Manufacturers' interest in entrepreneurial trainingprograms appears to be growing, in part because the recessionunderscores the need for stronger management at somedistributors.   But the recession has also reduced some distributors'interest in the programs. Sandy Corp., a Troy, Mich.,marketer of corporate-training programs, says attendance hasdropped 25% to 30% in the past two years at its seminars foradult children of General Motors' independent auto and truckdealers -- even though Sandy says GM is trying harder topromote attendance. Loreen Sesock, a Sandy manager, saysfewer dealers can afford the monthlong seminars, which cost$2,500 plus travel and lodging expenses.                                                                                                          Firms Serve Those Who   Want a Head Only Briefly                                                                                                          INTERIM EXECUTIVES are the focus of a new category ofplacement firm.   Several small headhunters have sprung up to providetemporary senior executives for other companies, includingstart-up enterprises looking to fill staffs fast. As therecession prompts widespread cost cutting, these placementfirms think many employers will prefer to hire interim ratherthan permanent help.   Meanwhile, layoffs are increasing the supply ofout-of-work executives willing to accept short-termassignments. Temporary-services agencies have long existed,of course, but mostly to provide lower-level workers.   Dahl-Morrow International, a new placement firm inBethesda, Md., may inspire by example: Its founders hired apresident, Robert Ryan, who says he expects to work there nolonger than three years. One client in Bethesda is StrategicTechnologies International, which expects to add a dozenexecutives this year under contracts of nine to 12 months.&quot;It's an inexpensive way to get very specific talents for astartup,&quot; says Kenneth J. Rice, co-owner of StrategicTechnologies, which develops computer systems for use inshipping and trade.   Interim Management, a three-year-old New York firm, saysit places five to seven executives a month in temporarypositions, many with small companies that venture-capitalinvestors are trying to bolster. Other clients are largecompanies seeking greater work-force flexibility. Interim'schairman, John A. Thompson, says, &quot;As they see a problem,they can acquire particular people to solve it -- with nocommitment to keep the people.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          SMALLER firms &quot;are significantly more likely than largercompanies to think they exceed their customers'expectations,&quot; a Grant Thornton survey of 250 executivesindicates. . . . California State University at Hayward saysits new Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies willsupply venture capital to local start-ups -- on the basis ofstudent recommendations.</TEXT></DOC>
