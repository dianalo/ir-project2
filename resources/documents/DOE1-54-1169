<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-54-1169 </DOCNO><TEXT>The loss of /sup 39/Ar from minerals in the course of neutron activationfor /sup 40/Ar//sup 39/Ar dating is studied by directly measuring theloss rates in vacuum-sealed ampoules. Biotite shows /sup 39/Ar lossesbetween 0.1% and 16%. These losses are predominantly due to diffusionprocesses from K-poor alteration-phase intergrowths in the biotites atthe elevated temperatures during the irradiation. Estimates for the irradiationtemperatures range from 150/sup 0/ to 180/sup 0/ C. Direct /sup 39/Arrecoil loss from biotite seems to be minor compared to difussion lossof recoil-implanted /sup 39/Ar. Precise /sup 40/Ar//sup 39/Ar datingof biotites therefore requires the measurement of the /sup 39/Ar lossesduring irradiation. Glauconite loses not only neutron-induced Ar isotopes(/sup 39/Ar: 20-22%, /sup 37/Ar: 17-19%) but also radiogenic /sup 40/Ar({similar_to}9%).Slight /sup 39/Ar losses are also observed for light micas (0.2% and0.35%), hornblendes (0.1%) and sanidines (200 and 700 ppm). 25 refs.;4figs.;6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
