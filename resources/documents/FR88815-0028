(This is not a toll-free number.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The current Title I regulations werepublished as a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 25, 1985 (50 FR 43516) and becameeffective on January 15, 1986 (51 FR 1495). The regulations have been amendedseveral times subsequent to January 15, 1986 to rectify problems encounteredby HUD and/or lenders. Experience by both HUD and lenders in operatingunder the current regulations has led the Department to conclude that additionalsubstantive changes in the regulations are necessary. Some of the changesbeing proposed concern basic policy, while others would merely clarifyambiguities in current provisions. Editorial changes would also be madein several other provisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Financing of Furniture</ITAG>Prior to the effective date of the current regulations, there was no specificlimit on the amount of loan proceeds that could be used to finance furniturein connection with the purchase of a manufactured home. The current regulations,in andSection; 201.10, placed a cap on the financing of furniture with theproceeds of a manufactured home loan, as follows: Loan proceeds may includean amount equal to the <T3>wholesale (base) price</T3> of any furniture package supplied by themanufacturer, subject to a maximum amount not to exceed the lesser of $2,000or 10 percent of the wholesale (base) price of the home.The Department estimates that furniture adds 7 to 13 percent ($1,500 to$2,500) to the <T3>retail price</T3> of the average manufactured home financed with aloan insured under Title I. In most instances of borrower default, thefurniture is in poor condition or has been removed before the lender repossessesthe home. In such cases, the furniture, which is part of the loan security,has little or no value and both lenders and the Department lose a greatdeal of money. Faced with these losses, the Department has concluded thatthe proceeds of manufactured home loans should no longer be used for thepurchase of furniture.Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend andSection;andSection; 201.2(p),(kk)(2), and (ll), 201.10(b)(1), and 201.26(b)(4)(iii)(C), (b)(6)(i) and(b)(7)(ii) by deleting all references to furniture as part of the loantransaction. In addition, andSection; 201.21(b)(3) would be amended to specificallystate that the proceeds of a manufactured home loan shall not be used topurchase furniture. The definition of ``furniture'' in andSection; 201.2(k)would be retained so as to enable program participants to know what iseligible and what is not eligible for inclusion in the loan.<ITAG tagnum="84">Hazard Insurance and Single-Interest Insurance</ITAG>Section 201.25(b)(2)(ii) allows Title I manufactured home purchase loansand combination loans to include the cost of premiums paid by the borrowerfor comprehensive and extended hazard insurance and vendor's single-interestinsurance coverage for three years. The Department proposes to change thisprovision with regard to both types of insurance.First, the Department proposes to reduce the number of years of hazardinsurance coverage that may be financed with the proceeds of a Title Imanufactured home loan from three years to one year. Premiums for thistype of insurance coverage are extremely costly_frequently adding $900to $2,400 to the loan, without adding to the value of the property. Thetypical manufactured home loan is for 15 years, and very little of thepremium is amortized for several years. If a default occurs during theearly years of the loan, the unpaid loan balance attributable to the premiumis usually not recovered from the proceeds of the sale of the home. Boththe lender and HUD share in this loss.The regulations in effect prior to January 15, 1986 permitted a manufacturedhome loan to include the costs of hazard insurance for up to five years.The proposed rule published in July 5, 1984 provided for a reduction inthe maximum term of a hazard insurance policy financed with the proceedsof a manufactured home loan to three years. In adopting the three-yearlimitation in the final rule that was published on October 25, 1985, theDepartment announced that it was contemplating a further reduction to oneyear in the term of hazard insurance premiums that may be financed. TheDepartment concluded at that time that financing multiple years of hazardinsurance coverage was, in the long run, more expensive to borrowers andincreased the amount of insurance claims paid by the Department. However,since the 1984 proposed rule had not addressed the possibility of lessthan three years' coverage, any further reduction would require proposedrulemaking and an opportunity for public comment.Accordingly, the Department now proposes to amend andSection; 201.25(b)(2)(ii)to provide that hazard insurance premiums financed with Title I loan proceedsbe limited to one year. For subsequent years of coverage, the borrowerwould be expected to pay for insurance either directly out-of-pocket orthrough monthly payments into an escrow account established by the lenderfor that purpose.Secondly, we believe that 201.25(b)(2)(ii), as it relates to vendor's single-interestinsurance premiums, is based upon a misconception as to how such insuranceworks and how premiums for such insurance are charged. Vendor's single-interestcoverage protects the secured creditor, although the premium is usuallypaid by the borrower. Coverage is conditioned on default on the loan andrepossession of the collateral by the lender, with payment being the lesserof the cost of repair, the remaining amount of the unpaid loan, or actualcash value. The premium is a one-time premium, unlike the premium for hazardinsurance. Therefore, a limitation on the number of years' premiums forvendor's single-interest insurance that can be financed has no meaning.Accordingly, the Department proposes to further amend andSection; 201.25(b)(2)(ii)to change the term ``vendor's single-interest insurance'' to ``single-interestinsurance'' in recognition of the fact that this insurance protects thesecured creditor, which is usually not the vendor. In addition, the Departmentwould clarify that the premium for single-interest insurance is a one-timepremium and therefore it is not subject to the one-year limitation on otherfinanced insurance premiums.Because single-interest insurance is not subject to subrogation, benefitspaid under such insurance coverage result in lenders obtaining double recoveriesfor such amounts if they are not accounted for in Title I insurance claimsas post-default payments. Permitting lenders to retain single-interestinsurance benefits without deducting them from the unpaid loan balancewould result in lenders bearing less than their statutorily-required 10percent coinsurance risk. Another result of exclusion of single-interestinsurance benefits from Title I claims is that borrowers are liable tothe Secretary for these amounts, even though they would not be liable tothe lender or the lender's single-interest insurance carrier. The Departmentdoes not believe that this is legally permissible, and therefore proposesto amend andSection; 201.55(b)(1)(ii) to include single-interest insurancebenefits in the enumerated post-default receipts to be deducted from theunpaid loan balance in calculating the Title I insurance claim.Section 201.28(b) of the Title I regulations now requires the borrowerto obtain and maintain hazard insurance on a manufactured home financedwith a Title I insured loan ``in an amount at least equal to the unpaidbalance of the loan or the actual cash value of the home, or home and lotin combination, whichever is lesser.'' Lenders and borrowers have pointedout that the requirement for insurance coverage in connection with a combinationloan reflects the value of the lot, which should not be insured becauseneither the lender nor the borrower would be able to recover more thanthe home's value in the event of a total loss. The Department agrees withthat position. In addition, the Department is concerned that requiringinsurance coverage equal to the lesser of the unpaid balance of the loanor the actual cash value of the home does not adequately protect the lender'sinterest when the value of the home has depreciated to a level below theunpaid balance of the loan.Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend andSection; 201.28(b) to requirethat hazard insurance coverage on a manufactured home be maintained inan amount at least equal to the unpaid loan balance. This amendment willassure that there is sufficient coverage to pay off the loan in the eventthat the home is a total loss. Where the manufactured home is appreciatingin value, lenders would be well-advised to require additional coverageto assure that both the borrower and the lender are adequately protectedin instances of either full or partial loss on the home.<ITAG tagnum="84">Loan Insurance Charges</ITAG>In recent years, the Title I manufactured home loan program has sustainedmajor underwriting losses. During the period 1984-1986, manufactured homeclaims exceeded loan insurance charges by more than $104 million. The Departmenthas concluded that this shortfall has been caused in part by the mannerin which the loan insurance charges have been assessed and collected.To determine whether the present system of collecting loan insurance chargesis actuarially sound, the Department conducted a study of 15-year manufacturedhome loans made under the Title I program, including a detailed analysisof loan survivorship, claims, and non-claim terminations. The study methodologywas then evaluated by a private consultant who confirmed its validity.As a result of the study, which took into account the more-stringent underwritingcriteria for loans made in 1986 and 1987, the Department concluded thatthe present system should be modified so that a higher percentage of thetotal loan insurance charge is collected in the early years of the loan,when the risks of default are greatest. Conversely, loan insurance chargesin the later years of the loan term, when risks of default are minimal,would be eliminated.The loan insurance charge for each Title I loan is set when the loan isregistered for insurance, in the following manner: The loan amount is multipliedby the applicable rate, and that result is multiplied by the number ofyears of the loan term. The loan insurance charge is payable in advance,<T3>i.e.,</T3> when the loan is registered, but may be paid at such timeand in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary. It has been theDepartment's policy that the insurance charge be paid in equal annual installmentsfor the term of the loan. The present rates are 0.50 percent for a propertyimprovement loan and 0.54 percent for a manufactured home loan.The Department proposes to amend andSection; 201.31 to (a) reduce the insurancecharge rate for a manufactured home loan from 0.54 percent to 0.50 percentof the loan amount for the term of the loan, (b) change the system of collectingthe loan insurance charge for a manufactured home loan, and (c) clarifythat the late charges that can be assessed are in fact penalty chargesand interest due from the lender when loan insurance charges are not paidin a timely manner.The manner in which the insurance charge for a manufactured home loan wouldbe collected is as follows:1. For a loan with a term in excess of two years but not more than 12 years,the loan insurance charge would be 1.00 percent of the loan amount foreach of the first three years, 0.75 percent for each of the next two years,and 0.50 percent for each succeeding year until the total loan insurancecharge, calculated in the manner described above, is paid.2. For a loan with a term in excess of 12 years but not more than 16 years,the loan insurance charge would be 1.00 percent of the loan amount foreach of the first four years, 0.75 percent for each of the next three years,and 0.50 percent for each succeeding year until the total loan insurancecharge is paid.3. For a loan with a term in excess of 16 years, the loan insurance chargewould be 1.00 percent of the loan amount for each of the first five years,0.75 percent for each of the next four years, and 0.50 percent for eachsucceeding year until the total loan insurance charge is paid.This change in the method of collecting the loan insurance charge willresult in a slightly lower total income charge in the case of a manufacturedhome loan that is amortized over the full term of the loan, since the insurancecharge rate would be reduced from 0.54 percent to 0.50 percent of the loanamount. However, since a higher percentage of the total insurance chargewould be collected in the early years of the loan, and since manufacturedhome loans are typically paid out in an average of 7 to 8 years, the overallimpact of this change would be to increase the amount of loan insurancecharges collected on most manufactured home loans.It is important for property improvement lenders to note that the insurancecharge rate for a property improvement loan would remain at 0.50 percentand the loan insurance charge would continue to be collected in the presentmanner.All loan insurance charges are considered earned when paid; therefore,if a loan is terminated by default or prepayment, all loan insurance chargesalready paid would be retained by the Department, except in the circumstancesdescribed in andSection; 201.31(e).<ITAG tagnum="84">Maximum Amount of an Unsecured Property Improvement Loan</ITAG>On December 30, 1982, the Department published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 47 FR 58240 a final rule requiring that allTitle I property improvement loans in excess of $2,500 be secured by arecorded lien upon the improved property. By notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 10, 1983 at 48 FR 10058, the final rulewas given on effective date of April 1, 1983. Prior to April 1, 1983, therequirement that a property improvement loan be secured by a recorded lienapplied only to loans in excess of $7,500. The change was deemed to benecessary ``because of the significant increase in personal bankruptcyfilings and the adverse treatment afforded unsecured property improvementloans in such proceedings'', and because ``[l]ien security will also enhancethe collectibility of loans and reduce credit insurance claims by insuredlenders.''The $2,500 ceiling for unsecured property improvement loans has been ineffect for approximately five years, and the Department has concluded thatthe desired results of a lower threshold for secured loans, as enunciatedabove, have not been achieved. The Department's security interest in aTitle I loan is usually in second or even lower position, so that foreclosureon the secured property after default is often not practical because itinvolves buying out the senior lienholder(s), and property values havenot usually supported such action, whether or not the debtor is in bankruptcy.Also, because of the expenses connected with a foreclosure, it has notbeen cost-effective in most cases involving loans under $5,000.Criticisms in 1982 by public commenters with regard to the reduced amountfor unsecured loans were that (a) there would be increased costs, in timeand expenses, associated with having to file liens for a greater numberof loans; (b) because the expense of recording a lien is essentially fixed,the required recordation may render smaller loans not cost-effective andmay disqualify moderate- and low-income borrowers; and (c) $2,500 is toolow a threshold, and any reduction should allow loans of less than $5,000to remain unsecured. Experience now shows that there was merit to thesecomments and, coupled with increased costs to improve property as a resultof inflation, the Department now is of the opinion that the limit for unsecuredloans should be increased to $5,000.This change in the maximum amount of an unsecured loan would be made byamending andSection; 201.24(a)(1) and (2).<ITAG tagnum="84">Manufactured Home Site Certification Requirements </ITAG>Section 201.21(e)(3) of the Title I regulations implements the site suitabilityrequirements in section 2(a) of the National Housing Act by requiring that,for leased home sites in manufactured home parks, lenders obtain certificationsof site compliance with standards for such parks. The certifications arerequired to be from the State or local authority which licenses such parks.Many States do not license manufactured home parks, and therefore lendershave had to obtain the certifications from registered civil engineers,often at great expense. The Department if proposing to simplify the certificationprocess by amending andSection; 201.21(e)(3) to require certifications ofsite suitability from the appropriate State or local government officials,such as a local planning or building official or public health official.This provision would also be amended to eliminate the requirement thatthe park comply with minimum standards on site location, storm drainageand landscaping, since most local jurisdictions do not establish or enforceminimum standards for these aspects of park development. Section 201.21(e)(4) of the regulations requires similar certificationsof site suitability and compliance with applicable standards for manufacturedhomes that are placed on individual lots or other sites owned or leasedby borrowers. One of the currently required certifications is that thesite is zoned to permit the placement of the manufactured home. Lendershave advised the Department that there are cases where either the landis not affirmatively zoned for manufactured homes, but the zoning doesnot prohibit their placement, or there are no local zoning requirements.Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend andSection; 201.21(e)(4)(i)to change the required certification, from one stating that the site iszoned to permit the placement of a manufactured home, to a more generalstatement that the site complies with local zoning ordinances and regulations,if any. In addition, the Department proposes to eliminate the requirementthat minimum storm drainage standards be met, in recognition of the lackof such standards in most local jurisdictions, and substitute a more generalcertification that any other minimum local standards and requirements forsite suitability are met. A certification from a registered civil engineerwould be required only when local standards for water supply and sewagedisposal are not established or enforced. Clarifying and editorial changes that would be made by this rule relateto the following matters: Late Charges Section 201.15 states that, subject to State law, the note may providefor certain late charges. The phrase ``subject to State law'' was intendedto assure that borrowers would be assessed late charges in accordance withthe Title I regulations or applicable State law, in the following manner:If State law provides for assessment of late charges after 10 days in arrears,the Title I regulations (providing for assessment of late charges after15 days in arrears) would apply; if State law provides for assessment oflate charges after 20 days in arrears, it would apply. Similarly, if themaximum amount of a late charge authorized by State law is less than thatauthorized by the Title I regulations, the former would apply; if the maximumamount authorized by State law is more than that authorized by the TitleI regulations, the latter would apply. The Department proposes to amendandSection; 201.15 to clarify the application of State law in regard to latecharges. Another requirement of andSection; 201.15 with regard to late charges isthat the borrower must be billed for any late charges imposed, and evidenceof such billing must be in the loan file if an insurance claim is made.The Department's concern with late charges is not so much whether or nota late charge is imposed upon a delinquent borrower by a separate billing_manylenders provide payment coupons to their borrowers which state how muchof a late charge is to be added to a late payment, so that separate billingis not needed_but how the late charge is paid. Late charges should notbe collected by deducting them from borrowers' monthly payments for principaland interest, and therefore the Department proposes to amend andSection;201.15 by (a) clarifying the requirement for billings for late charges,and (b) adding a requirement that late charges, if imposed, must be paidby the borrower and may not be deducted from the borrower's monthly paymentfor principal and interest. Section 201.15 also states that the note may provide for daily interestcharges based on the interest rate in the note in lieu of late charges.This was not intended to permit an additional charge based upon the noterate, but to mean that interest would accrue daily on the outstanding balanceof the loan. The Department proposes to clarify this by further amendingandSection; 201.15 to provide that if interest is charged on a daily basis,late charges may not be assessed by the lender. Appurtenances to Manufactured Homes Section 201.2(u) defines a manufactured home purchase loan as ``a loanfor the purchase of a manufactured home exclusive of any lot or site, andmay also include a garage, patio, carport or other comparable appurtenance.''However, in prescribing the various items that may be included in the maximumloan amount for such a loan in andSection; 201.10(b), no provision was madefor appurtenances. The Department has nevertheless permitted the financingof such items, but only with the approval of the Secretary and at theiractual cost to the borrower (see Notice published at 51 FR 9785, 9786,March 21, 1986). The Department proposes to amend andSection;andSection; 201.10(b), 201.21(b)(4),and 201.24(b) to provide, respectively, that (a) the cost of appurtenancesmay be included in the maximum amount of a manufactured home purchase loanunder the conditions set forth in the above-cited Notice, (b) manufacturedhome purchase loan proceeds may be used for the purchase, constructionor installation of appurtenances, and (c) any appurtenance that is financedwith the proceeds of a manufactured home purchase loan must be securedby a first lien. Fee and Charges Which Cannot Be Financed Section 201.25(c) specifies fees and charges which cannot be financed withthe loan proceeds. The first sentence of andSection; 201.25(c) states, inrelevant part, that these fees ``. . . may be collected in the initialpayment by the borrower prior to loan disbursement, but may not be includedin the loan amount or otherwise financed or advanced'' by other partiesto the loan transaction. The Department's intention in promulgating thisprovision was to prevent the financing of these fees, but not to preventthe lender from paying these fees as a cost of doing business. The Departmentproposes to clarify that lenders can pay such fees by revising the firstsentence of andSection; 201.25(c) accordingly.Proofs of claim in bankruptcy and probateSection 201.42 requires a lender to file a proof of claim with the courthaving jurisdiction in cases where the lender has timely information thata borrower is involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, or is deceased,and the loan is in default and subject to acceleration. The Departmenthas experienced cases in which borrowers have gone into bankruptcy or havedied without being in default on their Title I obligations. Lenders shouldbe required to file proofs of claim in such cases, and the Department proposesto amend this section accordingly.In addition, lenders have frequently questioned the Department as to thenecessity of filing a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding when thecourt has identified it as a ``no asset'' case and has stated that proofsof claim should not be filed. The Department's policy is that a proof ofclaim need not be filed in such situations, and the Department proposesto amend andSection; 201.42 to clarify the policy. This would be the onlyexception to the requirement in andSection; 201.42 for filing a proof ofclaim in a bankruptcy proceeding.Many Title I insurance claims have been submitted following deaths or bankruptciesof borrowers. Frequently in such a case, the lender has filed a proof ofclaim and then notified the court that the loan obligation has been assignedto HUD; the lender has then considered itself to have no further involvementafter such notification. The Department, on the other hand, has taken theposition that the assignment of a loan obligation is not accepted untilpayment is made on the insurance claim, and the lender must continue toexercise its rights as a creditor until the claim is paid. The Departmentproposes to further amend andSection; 201.42 to clarify this position byrequiring lenders to take all steps necessary to protect the interestsof the creditor, until the Secretary has paid the claims. Following payment,the Secretary will notify the appropriate court of the assignment of theobligation and request that the United States be substituted as the creditor.Appraisals of repossessed manufactured homesThe first sentence of andSection; 201.51(b)(3) of the regulations requireslenders to obtain a HUD-approved appraisal for each repossessed manufacturedhome. The second sentence states that the appraisal ``should reflect theretail value of comparable manufactured homes in similar condition andin the same geographic area . . . .'' The Department's view is that ``samegeographic area'' clearly refers to the area where the home is repossessed.However, some lenders have argued that this provision permits the manufacturedhome to be appraised on the basis of comparables in the area where thehome is located for purposes of resale, which may be different from thearea where the home was repossessed.The Department recognizes that it is sometimes necessary for the home tobe moved to another geographic area to obtain a better resale price, butwe are concerned about the potential for abuses that can occur when thehome is moved from the area where it was repossessed without first obtainingan appraisal. We have found instances where homes have been moved mainlyfor the purposes of obtaining lower appraisals, with the result that theDepartment's claim exposure is increased. One means of minimizing thistype of program abuse is to require that an appraisal be obtained in thesame area where the home was repossessed before moving it to another geographicarea. Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend the second sentenceof andSection; 201.51(b)(3) to explicitly state that the appraisal must bebased upon comparables in the same geographic area where the repossessionoccurred.Hazard Insurance in Combination Loan ClaimsSection 201.55(b)(3) of the regulations allows a lender to include thecost of premiums for hazard insurance on a repossessed manufactured homein its insurance claim for a manufactured home purchase loan. In andSection;201.55(b)(5) of the regulations, relating to insurance claims for manufacturedhome lot loans and combination loans where both the foreclosed manufacturedhome and the lot are classified as realty, the lender's cost of premiumsfor hazard insurance on the home was inadvertently omitted from the finalrule as an eligible item for inclusion in the insurance claim, althoughthe proposed rule published at 49 FR 27533 on July 5, 1984 did providefor inclusion of hazard insurance premiums in a combination loan claim.The Department proposes to amend andSection; 201.55(b) by redesignating andSection;201.55(b)(5)(iii) as andSection; 201.55(b)(5)(iv) and adding a new andSection;201.55(b)(iii)to allow an insurance claim on a combination home and lot loan to includethe cost of hazard insurance on the home, prorated to the date of dispositionof the property.<ITAG tagnum="84">Corrections</ITAG>In the third sentence of andSection; 201.13, the second ``of'' should havebeen ``for''. The Department proposes to make this change by revising thesentence accordingly. Section 201.51(a)(2) provides that ``if a lender holds one or more mortgagesor other security instruments senior to a secured property improvementloan, and if the borrower defaults on any such instrument or on the propertyimprovement loan, the lender may both proceed against the secured propertyunder such senior security instrument and later submit a claim under itsTitle I contract of insurance'' if the lender follows certain procedures.The quoted revision contains a typographical error; it should have statedthat the lender may proceed against the property under the senior securityinstrument and file a Title I claim only if the borrower defaults on <T3>both </T3>instruments. The Department proposes to make the appropriatecorrection.A further correction is required in andSection; 201.51(a)(2)(iv), which containsa reference to andSection; 201.55(b).
