Gen. Andres Rodriguez, the second-in-command of the army and aclose associate of Gen. Stroessner, said in a radio broadcast thatParaguay's commander-in-chief for 34 years had surrendered.   The announcement came after hours of gunfights and cannon fire inthe capital's streets Thursday night between rebel soldiers backedby tanks and mortars and forces loyal to Stoessner.   There was no official word on casualties, but residents whoventured out this morning saw bloodstains on the pavement.   The country's borders were closed.   The police headquarters was pockmarked with bullets from smallarms fire, and metal shredded by the bullets hung from the modernNational Telephone building behind the police station.   ``Order has been re-established, and with it all the human valuesof our entire constitution will be respected,'' said Rodriguez, whois father-in-law to Stroessner's youngest son, Alfredo.   ``I communicate to you that Gen. Stroessner has surrendered andfinds himself in perfect health, deprived of liberty, being shownall human rights, at a residence within the First Army Corps,'' hesaid in the broadcast.   Rodriguez said he was ``taking command of the country from thismoment.''   Diplomats and political sources said shortly before the coup thatRodriguez for undetermined reasons apparently was ordered to give uphis command and retire or accept the post of defense minister. Herefused.   The rebellion also followed a dispute within the ruling ColoradoParty between a militant pro-Stroessner faction and traditionalistswho wanted to distance the 100-year-old party from the authoritariangeneral.   In Washington, a senior U.S. official said the United States wasmonitoring the situation. ``We don't like violence, of course, andwe hope that whatever government emerges will embrace democracy.''   Stroessner, 76, has been the absolute ruler of this landlockedSouth American country since 1954. He was army commander-in-chief,doled out political favors and jobs to his allies and called anyonewho opposed him a Marxist subversive. He frequently exiled politicalopponents.   However, Stroessner, a staunch U.S. ally, has been in poor healthfollowing prostate surgery five months ago.   In an earlier radio communique, Rodriguez said he and his men``left our barracks in defense of the dignity and the honor of thearmed forces, for the full and total unification of the rulingColorado Party, for the initiation of democratization in Paraguay(and) for the respect of human rights.''   Early today, radio reports quoted an infantry division commander,Brig. Gen. Ismael Otazu, as saying the uprising was not``insubordination but a correction.'' Col. Dionisio Cabello toldMarch 1 radio he was the new air force commander and pledgedallegiance to Rodriguez.   Infantry divisions in three interior cities _ Villarrica, SanJuan Bautista and Concepcion _ and an air force unit sided almostimmediately with the rebels, the reports indicated.   Soldiers today blocked the street in front of the National Palacenear the central business district of this capital city of 900,000.The palace did not look like it sustained damage, but residents sawbloodstains on nearby streets.   ``We're happy the government is gone, but we're sad that peoplehad to die,'' said one woman, who added that the shelling and smallarms fire had forced her to spend Thursday night in a restaurant.   Spokesman for the National Accord, a coalition of business,church and political leaders who have called for democratic reforms,said a transitional military junta may be named today to governuntil general elections are held. They spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Rodriguez, who did not mention a transitional junta or elections,is identified with a faction within the Colorado Party that favorslimited democratic reforms.   The uprising began late Thursday when the nation's largestmilitary unit, the First Army Corps, fired at the headquarters ofthe police and presidential guard in shooting that lasted until dawn.   Residents of Asuncion quickly deserted the streets when thefirefights involving cannon, recoilless rifles and heavy machineguns broke out.   Witnesses reported seeing 40 to 50 tanks rumble downtown.   ``We're all keeping our heads down. We can hear mortar roundslanding'' at the presidential escort battalion, a U.S. diplomatsaid. The embassy is located between the battalion and Stroessner'sofficial residence.   Domingo Laino, leader of the opposition Authentic Radical LiberalParty, said: ``It has something to do with Rodriguez and (Sabino)Montonaro,'' who is the interior minister and president of theColorado Party.   Montonaro leads the militant faction, which took over partyleadership in August 1987 and since has purged its opponents frompositions of power.   The military and the Colorado Party control nearly all facets oflife in the California-sized nation of nearly 4 million betweenBrazil, Bolivia and Argentina. Although closely allied with theUnited States, Stroessner was criticized for human rights abuses bythe Reagan administration in 1986.   Stroessner toppled President Federico Chavez in 1954.</TEXT></DOC>
