But these materials all have one problem: starch.    Biodegradable products deteriorate as their molecules are eaten by microorganisms. Plastic molecules, however, are too big for microorganisms to consume. So, the molecules are mixed with starch, which the bacteria or fungi can eat, breaking the plastic molecules down into smaller, bite-sized pieces. But starch also weakens plastic's structure and can introduce microorganisms into food packaging.    Ramini Narayan, the head of organic and polymer research at Purdue University, has overcome these difficulties with a process that has attracted the interest of such big plastics makers as Dow Chemical Co. and Mobil Corp.    To prevent microorganisms from devouring the plastic as it sits on a grocery shelf, Mr. Narayan uses cellulose acetate, a natural plastic derived from wood pulp, instead of starch. Cellulose acetate is prone to attack by microorganisms only after a reaction with soil changes its chemical structure to cellulose.    Mr. Narayan has developed a &quot;copolymer&quot; that grafts the molecules of cellulose acetate and synthetic plastics, which have different chemical structures, together in a &quot;tight fit.&quot; The result, he says, is a plastic that retains its properties and yet is biodegradable in a landfill.    Wineries Profit Using   Home-Made Nitrogen   TO PREVENT wine from turning into vinegar, wineries use nitrogen to shield the alcoholic beverage from oxygen when it is being put into a barrel or bottle. Most wineries use highly pressured cylinders of liquid nitrogen. But the supercooled gas is expensive. So, some wineries have discovered a cheaper source of nitrogen.    Fetzer Vineyards of Redwood Valley, Calif., now uses a plastic membrane made by Monsanto Co. to extract nitrogen from air. &quot;It is the first time that we're aware of any winery using this technology,&quot; says Alexander Snage, market manager for Monsanto's Permea division, which makes the Prism Alpha membrane.    Air separation membranes are a relatively young invention. The St. Louis chemical maker developed a first-generation membrane 10 years ago to separate hydrogen from nitrogen in ammonia, and carbon dioxide from methane. It developed the Prism Alpha two years ago and sold the technology to apple growers, who use it to blanket their plucked apples from oxygen, which extends the fruit's life up to nine months.    Air consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and other gases. To separate the elements, compressed air is forced through the Prism Alpha membrane, which allows only nitrogen to pass through. &quot;You can buy our system and produce nitrogen at the site at a fraction of the cost of having nitrogen shipped to your plant,&quot; says Mr. Snage of Monsanto.    'Super Oxygen' Eases   Environmental Problem   SAFE DISPOSAL of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, once widely used as insulation in electronics and transformers, has been a nagging problem ever since they were found in the 1960s to be deadly.    PCBs' virtues -- chemical stability and high heat resistance -- have made them difficult to burn. The Environmental Protection Agency approves incineration, but the process gives off dioxin, which is substantially more toxic than PCBs themselves. So the safest method of disposal has been storage in sealed containers.    Chemists have tried unsuccessfully to render PCBs chemically harmless, which would allow them to be disposed safely. In fact, Donald Sawyer at Texas Aandamp;M University, who discovered a way to break down such chlorinated pesticides as DDT, and other chemists believed that PCBs couldn't be broken down.    Now Mr. Sawyer and his researchers at the university have discovered that PCBs can be made to react with an oxygen atom that has &quot;a lot of energy,&quot; says Hiroshi Sugimoto, one of the researchers. They combined two oxygen atoms and added an electron to form a highly charged &quot;superoxide ion,&quot; and found that it broke down highly chlorinated PCBs into harmless bicarbonate of soda and table salt.    A Process to Produce   Wrinkle-Free Cottons   TEXTILE MAKERS blend cotton with polyester or other synthetic materials to produce wrinkle-resistant fabrics. But polyester doesn't absorb moisture, so permanent-press clothes aren't as cool as those made from all-cotton fibers.    Now, U.S. Department of Agriculture chemists say they have developed a way to make all-cotton, permanent-press apparel. The process also uses non-toxic polycarboxylic acids, while the method for making most current permanent-press fabrics involves formaldehyde, which has caused cancer in laboratory animals.    Clark M. Welch and Bethlehem K. Andrews of the USDA's research facilities in New Orleans use four groups of chemicals, or &quot;catalysts,&quot; to bind polycarboxylic acids to fibers, making them wrinkle-resistant. Fabrics are soaked in the acids and the catalysts, and then quickly heated for no more than 90 seconds at temperatures as high as 410 degrees Fahrenheit, which bonds the acids with the cellulose molecules of the cotton fibers.    The ability of these acids to make fabrics wrinkle-resistant has been known for nearly two decades, but chemists had found them impractical to use. Without the catalysts, the process would take hours. And at such high temperatures, &quot;the fabric would burn up,&quot; Mr. Welch says. &quot;The catalysts are the key.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
