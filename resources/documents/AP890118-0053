(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Korean-American businessman accused oftrying to buy deadly nerve gas for export was held on $2 millionbail after a prosecutor argued the man might flee to his high-levelcontacts overseas.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer said Juwhan Yun, 49,``bragged that he had close personal contacts with high-rankingcivilian and military officials in many countries,'' includingYugoslavia, the People's Republic of China and South Korea.   U.S. magistrate Ronald Hedges set the $2 million figure at a bailhearing Tuesday for Yun of Short Hills. Yun had not posted bail asof Tuesday night, and his lawyer said he will ask the man's friendsto help.   Hedges imposed strict travel restrictions, ordered Yun's familyto surrender their passports and forbade Yun to make overseascontacts should bail be met.   Yun was arrested Thursday and charged with conspiring toillegally export the nerve gas sarin, possibly to Iran. Thecomplaint said Yun also discussed acquiring anti-aircraft andanti-tank missiles and military radar equipment with an undercoveragent.   Yun has pleaded innocent.   The magistrate said that even though the crime was not a violentone, it was serious enough to merit high bail.   ``If true, (the charge) certainly demonstrates an attempt by thedefendant to profit from death to others,'' Hedges said.   Yun's lawyer, Stephen N. Dratch, said he hoped Yun's friendsmight be willing to post their property as surety. Yun owns a$400,000 New York City condominium and lives in a $650,000 house buthad a total equity _ excluding mortgages _ of only $350,000, whichHedges said could go toward the bail.   Dratch said Yun earned $150,000 a year from his import-exportbusiness. Hedges said he doubted Yun could support a wife, threechildren, extensive travel and $64,800 in yearly mortgage paymentson that amount.   Ms. Singer added that Yun had recently bought a new luxury car.   Yun entered the courtroom shackled. His wife sat in the secondrow, her hands clasped in her lap and her eyes closed through mostof the hearing.   Ms. Singer disclosed that Yun had sought to acquire Mark 19-3grenade launchers during the seven months of negotiations with theundercover agent. The 40 mm weapon, acquired by the Army five yearsago, can fire up to 375 grenades a minute.   When the arrest was announced, officials said Iran at one pointwas identified as the nerve gas's destination, but that was notverified and no foreign government officials appeared to be involved.   Ms. Singer told Hedges that Yun was planning an around-the-worldtrip in January to Beijing, Iran, Europe and South Korea. Also, sheidentified as French citizens two men who met with Yun and anaccused co-conspirator in London over the nerve gas deal.   Authorities have said they were trying to identify the men, whowere under surveillance at the meeting.   A warrant has been issued for the second man, Charles Caplan ofLondon. Authorities said they were considering the possibility ofseeking his extradition.   Dratch said Yun came to the United States in 1972 and wasnaturalized six years later after receiving a master's degree fromthe American Graduate School of International Management. He foundedhis business, Komex International Corp. of Summit, in San Franciscoin 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
