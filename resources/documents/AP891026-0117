SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chilly climate of Tibet has been warmerover the past half-century than at any time in thousands of years,a team of scientists sponsored by the National Science Foundationreported Thursday.   The analysis of ice collected in remote north-central Tibetrevealed what the scientists termed a ``striking'' warming in thatregion since the 1940s.   Their report, in the journal Science, is based on the differenttypes of oxygen that collect in ice at different temperatures. Itdoes not include estimates of actual temperature changes in Tibet.   The study was conducted by researchers from the Byrd PolarResearch Center at Ohio State University, the Chinese Institute ofGlaciology and Geocryology and the University of Copenhagen,Denmark.   They compared the various isotopes of oxygen in accumulated iceto analyse temperature changes in Tibet over the past 6,000 to8,000 years, and concluded that the readings suggest recenttemperatures are the warmest.   A connection with any ``greenhouse effect'' global warming hasnot been established, the researchers said.   The term ``greenhouse'' warming refers to a possibility ofrising temperatures worldwide that has many researchers concernedabout disruptive changes in world climate.   Another report on that topic appeared Thursday in the BritishJournal Nature, where researchers concluded that the world's oceansand seas did not show significant warming from 1982 to mid-1988,contradicting earlier reports.   The reports of warming in Tibet but none in the oceans could beconsistent with one another, however.   James E. Hansen of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, a leading spokesman on the global warming issue,has estimated that if greenhouse warming is taking place the largeland masses would be affected sooner and more strongly than theoceans.   Thus, an area such as Tibet, landlocked in the largestcontinent, could be expected to record a warming before any of theworld's oceans, which absorb heat and change temperature much moreslowly than does the land.   The greenhouse warming, according to scientists, could resultfrom the gradual increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dueto industrial processes. The fear is that this gas would trap heatsomewhat like a greenhouse, causing temperatures to rise.   However, other scientists question this theory and urge moreresearch before taking any actions to halt the threatened climatechange.</TEXT></DOC>
