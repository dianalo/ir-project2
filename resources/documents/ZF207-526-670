Morris told U.S.andP;  District Court MagistrateGustave DiBianco during his 11-minute arraignment Wednesday.andP;  Morris is theHarvard graduate and Cornell graduate student who was indicted last week by afederal grand jury in last year's virus attack on the ARPAnet computernetwork.andP;  U.S.andP;  Attorney Frederick Scullin Jr.andP;  says that Morris faces afive-year prison sentence and up to a $250,000 fine if convicted.andP;  Morris,who was released on his own recognizance, could also be ordered to payrestitution which could run into the millions of dollars.andP;  CornellUniversity, which has placed Morris on suspension, claims that Morris createdand spread the computer &quot;worm&quot; last November 2, which paralyzed over 6,000government and university computers.andP;  The Cornell report called the worm'screation, a &quot;juvenile act that ignored the clear potential consequences.&quot; TheCornell study also says that technically the small program was a &quot;worm&quot;rather than a &quot;virus&quot; because it was an independent program rather thanattached to other programs or the operating system.andP;  A virus is a programthat attaches itself to other programs and replicates itself, spreadingthrough a system, just as a biological virus attaches to cells and spreads.andO;A worm is an independent program that replicates itself without help fromother programs.andP;  The difference may prove important in the court case,because, while a virus often is designed to damage data and programs, a wormmerely grows so much that it clogs up a system, much like the tribbles of thefamous Star Trek TV episode, which multiplied until they jammed up the works.andO;For his part, Morris has reportedly said that his program mutated, cyclingfaster and faster until it crashed computers thousands of miles away.andP;  Hesays the program he created was relatively benign.andP;  A quarterly hacker'sjournal titled &quot;2600 Magazine&quot; regularly describes techniques for breakinginto systems (destructive hacking) and creating virus and worm programs, bothfrom the hacker's viewpoint and from the side of systems security personnel.andO;Further information can be obtained from 2600 Enterprises, Box 752, MiddleIsland, New York 11953, phone 516-751-2600.andP;  (John McCormick andamp; DanaBlankenhorn/19890803)</TEXT></DOC>
