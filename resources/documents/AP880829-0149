(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Olympic diver pleaded innocent Monday tocharges that he drove a car into a group of teen-agers and killedtwo of them, and a judge ordered him not to drive a car while heawaits trial.   Bruce Kimball faces two counts of drunken-driving manslaughterand three counts of drunken-driving in an accident with seriousinjury.   Judge Harry Coe allowed the 1984 Olympic silver medalist toremain free on $10,000 bond and said he would not restrictKimball's travel before his tentative trial date of Nov. 14 becausehe was satisified the diver posed no risk of flight.   The judge also said the high-profile case had drawn so muchpublicity that ``the whole country in a sense is watching him.''   Kimball, who finished second in the Olympic platform divingcompetition four years ago, was a favorite to make the 1988 U.S.team before the Aug. 1 accident. However, he did not qualify forthis year's squad during Olympic trials in Indianapolis earlierthis month.   Kimball, 24, said nothing when attorney Frank Quesada enteredthe plea before Coe. If convicted, Kimball faces up to 45 years inprison.   Co-defense counsel Lee Fugate did not object to the drivingrestriction as a condition of bond, saying Kimball would beattending the University of Michigan this fall and workingpart-time at his father's diving school and could walk.   Prosecutors have refused to release the results of Kimball'sblood-alcohol tests from the accident, but the Tampa Tribune hasreported it was 0.20 percent. Under Florida law, a driver with alevel of 0.10 of higher is presumed intoxicated.   Police estimate Kimball was traveling between 70 and 90 mph whenhis car struck several other vehicles and plowed through a group ofteen-agers gathered at a popular roadside hangout in suburbanBrandon.   Coe instructed attorneys to notify witnesses that they would notbe allowed to publicly discuss the case. The judge cited concernsfor prospective jurors.   He also set a meeting for Sept. 8 to discuss with mediarepresentatives any restrictions he might impose on the press attrial.</TEXT></DOC>
