It must resign immediately,'' Assemblyman ChoiYung-kun said at the start of a special National Assembly sessionto discuss the violence.   The opposition Reunification Democratic Party and the Party forPeace and Democracy did not call for Roh's resignation.   But they charged that the government is blocking democraticreform and using a crackdown on violent protests as a pretext tomove against all its opponents. They accused the government ofprovoking unrest.   The opposition-controlled Assembly can pass a resolution callingon the Cabinet to resign, but the administration does not have toaccept such a call.   Lawmakers of the governing Democratic Justice Party accused theopposition of trying to block a crackdown on the violent dissidentsand weaken the Roh administration.   A wave of violent protests and strikes has hit South Korea inrecent months, and many Koreans are calling for an end to theunrest after six riot troopers were killed by students on May 3.   Radical students and the anti-government dissident groups havelittle support because of their violent tactics and extremepolitical views. The radicals have been calling for the overthrowof Roh and the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers andfarmers.   The government has warned that efforts by radicals to build analliance with workers threatens political and economic stability.   ``Leftist forces trying to overthrow our parliamentary democracyand free democratic system will face stern punishment,'' Kang saidtoday. The prime minister said nothing about resigning.   Roh warned after the riot trooper deaths that he would invokeemergency powers if the violence does not end. Security forces havebeen ordered to round up dissident leaders and block all protests.   The government is trying to push a bill through the assemblycalling for tougher punishment for radicals who make or usefirebombs. The law would increase prison sentences for usingfirebombs from three years to seven years.   The opposition opposes the bill, contending the government mustlimit police use of tear gas against protesters. Some oppositionleaders say riot police should only use tear gas with permission ofthe prime minister or home minister, and must obtain it even whenbattling rioters.   Kim Dae-jung, leader of the Party for Peace and Democracy, saidtoday the government was using the crackdown as an excuse to limitpolitical freedom.   He accused Roh of attempting to revive the authoritarian rule offormer president Chun Doo-hwan, who stepped down in 1988, byimposing restrictions on all opposition groups.   Roh, a former general, won presidential elections in late 1987after rival opposition candidates split the anti-government vote.He has helped introduce democratic reforms, but many Koreansdistrust the government because of its ties to the Chun regime.</TEXT></DOC>
