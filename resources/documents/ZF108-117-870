(CPC).andM;The combined companies intend to focus on developing the market for the IEEE802.6 Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) technology.andP;  MANs physically tietogether LANs and direct-attached systems over a large area.andM;Applitek's product line provides a backbone network based on cable television(CATV) technology that allows a LAN to span 35 miles.andM;CPC and Applitek plan to support fiber-optic-based MANs when the 802.6standard is finalized and will provide a transition path between 802.6networks and the current Applitek backbone network, said CPC President DarrolCordes.andP;  The draft of the 802.6 standard is in its sixth revision.andM;Unlike standard broadband networks, the Applitek backbone can carry 10Mbitsper second (Mbps) of data on each of the 56 6MHz channels available on CATVcable, said Rouzbeh Yassini-Fard, Applitek's vice president of sales andmarketing.andP;  The backbone as a whole offers a bandwidth greater than 200Mbps,company officials said.andM;Yassini-Fard said Applitek networks can span 35 miles because theyincorporate the UniLink media access technique, a register-insertion schemedeveloped by Applitek.andP;  With the UniLink technique, one node on the networkacts as a sequencer, dividing the network into time slots.andP;  A node cantransmit data during any unoccupied time slot.andM;Applitek offers X.25 and SNA gateways, an Ethernet bridge, and asynchronousand synchronous terminal servers.andM;CPC's product line includes the CPNX network management system as well asterminal gateways.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
