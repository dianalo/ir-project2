No date has been set for the meeting between Arens, Secretary ofState James A. Baker III and Egyptian Foreign Minister EsmetAbdel-Meguid. The three will discuss the composition of aPalestinian delegation to direct talks with Israeli officials.   In violence Monday in the occupied territories, troops shot andwounded 14 Palestinian protesters, Arab hospital officials said.The army said it was investigating.   Arens cast some doubt Monday on his planned trip to Washington,saying he is concerned about reports that Egypt is acting as a``postman'' for the PLO.   ``The Egyptians, who started the process as an independentfactor, have lately presented themselves as, in effect, a postmanfor the PLO,'' Arens said on army radio. ``If this is what will be,I fear that we won't get very far.''   Last month, the Cabinet linked Israeli acceptance of Baker'sproposal for the Washington meeting to assurances that the PLOwould play no part in the peace process.   Asked about the proposed Washington trip, Arens said, ``Firstly,I'm not going yet. We will first conduct contacts concerning theguarantees that our Cabinet has requested.''   Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein is scheduled to go toWashington this week to discuss the assurances sought by Israel,said Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.   The latest hitch in the talks followed weekend news reports thatIsraeli, Egyptian, U.S. and Palestinian officials were holdingsecret contacts to draw up a preliminary list of Palestiniannegotiators.   The clashes Monday were sparked by the fatal shootings Sunday oftwo Palestinians, apparently by Israeli civilians who opened firedafter their cars were stoned, Israeli and Arab reports said.   The deaths raised to 631 the number of Palestinians killed byIsraelis during the two-year uprising against Israeli rule. Atleast 155 other Palestinians have been killed by their fellow Arabswho accused them of cooperating with Israeli authorities orinvolvement in prostitution or drug-dealing. Forty-three Israelisalso have died.   In Gaza City, a military court sentenced four Palestinian men toprison terms ranging from 10 to 14 years for throwing firebombs atmilitary patrols in April 1989, a military spokesman said. No onewas injured in the attacks.   In Jerusalem, police said they detained for questioning at least21 Palestinian youths after the funeral of 17-year-old JosephAlbert Muneir turned into a nationalist demonstration.   Muneir's family claims he died Sunday as a result of beatings byIsraeli soldiers, but a police investigation reported he died ofnatural causes.   About 500 Arab youths marched behind Muneir's coffin, singingthe Palestinian national anthem and waving the outlawed red, white,black and green Palestinian flag. Nearly 100 police andparamilitary border policemen stood guard.   Israel's military administration of the occupied territoriesordered the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to keepthe 90 schools it operates for Palestinian refugees in the occupiedWest Bank closed until the new academic year begins Jan. 10.   A spokesman for the administration said all 930 schools in theWest Bank will remain closed until then.   The schools have been closed since the school year ended Nov. 1.   UNRWA had announced its schools would reopen Monday to givestudents a chance to complete the past academic year. The studentswere unable to complete the full year because many schools havebeen closed frequently during the uprising.</TEXT></DOC>
