Gerald Stites is a real-life Rambo. An Army sergeantfrom Oklahoma with two white scars on his face, he is ascout. It's his job to sneak deep behind enemy lines, find ahole to hide in and quietly observe Iraqi forces.   With skirmishing on the ground already under way, Sgt.Stites and his fellow scouts and forward observers areperforming a crucial role. When the major offensives begin,they could become decisive. From their hiding places near theenemy, they will radio coded messages to allied troops todirect artillery shelling, tank attacks and aerial bombingsagainst dug-in troops. And how well they pinpoint theopposing Iraqi artillery will go a long way in determiningthe toll in U.S. lives.</LP><TEXT>   Is he afraid? On the contrary. &quot;I know I'm professional.That's why I'm not worried,&quot; he says evenly. &quot;I know where togo, what to look for, and how to resupply my men.&quot;   Everyone gearing up to slip behind enemy lines is acutelyaware of his critical role. &quot;The big guns don't shoot untilwe give the go-ahead,&quot; says Sgt. Chris Lee, sitting under abrown camouflage net near a towering 155mm howitzer. &quot;We moreor less control the show.&quot; The scouts have been going outfarther toward the enemy every night, but they won't say howfar they have gone.   Many military jobs are dangerous in war. But here, alongthe front, knots of elite U.S. troops are steeling themselvesfor some of the most hazardous tasks of all. Snipers, thosesolo practitioners recognizable by the distinctiveblack-padded cases resembling big violins in which they totetheir telescope-fitted rifles, are cleaning their weapons andstudying the terrain. Teams of combat engineers are readyingtheir armored bulldozers to brave mine fields, cut throughbarbed wire and bridge ditches filled with burning oil. Evensome average GIs whose job it is to fire the tank-killing TOWmissile are contemplating those long seconds during whichthey must stand exposed to enemy fire while taking aim.   But when the ground fighting begins, few soldiers will beso much in harm's way, or perform such essential work, as thescouts and forward observers who act as the eyes and ears ofthe giant army behind them. &quot;A company can lose an armoredvehicle or two and keep going,&quot; says a scout for the Army'sThird Armored Division, one of the units expected to driveinto Iraq against the elite Republican Guard. &quot;But if youknock out the scouts, a whole combat brigade&quot; -- that is,about 3,000 soldiers -- &quot;suddenly can become ineffective.&quot;   Scouts and observers typically move in pairs, driving atruck or a Bradley fighting vehicle, which with its cannonand machine gun resembles a tank. They usually pack enoughfood and water for several days. When sufficiently forward,they may look for a place to stash their vehicle and proceedon foot, protected only by their rifles, their two-way radiosand their wits.   There the missions of scouts and observers diverge.Forward artillery observers have a narrow mandate: Locatetargets for the Army's big guns and tanks and then radio thedata back in short bursts of specialized jargon to thewaiting crews, or to an intermediary coordinating air supportor naval shelling.   Scouts have the broader and harder assignment of observingthe enemy and figuring out what he is up to. They go outfarther, stay out longer, and report back to higher levels,usually to the colonel commanding their brigade. Scouts seethemselves as the absolute elite -- faster, smarter and morealert than their opponents. &quot;We simply have to be better thaneverybody else to do our job,&quot; says Lt. Ron Clark, sittingout the morning chill inside an armored troop carrier.   At the pinnacle of the scouts are the long-rangereconnaissance teams. Sgt. Stites, the Oklahoman, leads oneof these seven-man units, which roam as far as 30 milesbehind enemy lines for as long as a week. Unlike the Rambo ofthe cinema, they have standing orders to withdraw when theyspot the enemy and report back to their commanders. If introuble, they have special code words to call in helicoptersto pick them up at prearranged landing sites. The key tosurviving, scouts say, is recognizing the situation andreacting to it quicker than the enemy does.   But in most respects the jobs of the observers and scoutsare largely the same, and so are the hazards. Enemy fire isone, but so is simply getting lost in a featureless desertwhere there is nothing on the horizon but the horizon itself.Most regular soldiers here in the Saudi desert are advisednot to wander far from their tents at night, and Armytruckers generally aren't allowed to drive in the desertafter dark.   Scouts and observers go out into that night and travelmiles. Despite their training and skills, every one seems tohave a story about becoming disoriented on a cloudy, mistynight in the desert, when it is impossible to see more than afew feet.   There also are hostile forces out there. But scouts andforward observers say close encounters with Iraqi troopsdon't worry them so much. &quot;Speed will help us get out oftrouble,&quot; says one young observer from Dallas. &quot;I feel saferworking 10 feet from the enemy than sitting way back&quot; infront of his own lines.   Indeed, out in front is, for some, where the fun is.Peering over a gulley's edge, equipped with a transmitterconcealed hundreds of yards away, the observer will listen tothe shells whistle overhead, watch them hit, and then use theradio to fine-tune his gunners' aim. If enemy artilleryshould open up, the observer tries to help locate itsposition after it fires just one or two rounds. To avoiddetection, his transmissions are supposed to last no longerthan four seconds. &quot;I don't think there's anything moreexciting than looking down range and watching steel hit thetarget,&quot; says Maj. David Cook, fondly recalling his days asan observer.   For all their bravado, getting shot or captured isn'tsomething that scouts or observers want to discuss. Even so,as ground fighting begins, the mood of the scouts andobservers is noticeably more buoyant than that of regulartroops. Compared with many infantrymen and tank crews, theyappear less anxious and more energetic. That may be in partbecause their many solitary hours in the desert have giventhem the time and opportunity to confront their fears. At anyrate, reasons Sgt. Stites, &quot;sitting in an M-1 tank would turnus into a bigger target.&quot;   What really scares them is the prospect of being fired onby their own side. Evading the enemy is only part of the job.Coming back toward friendly lines is just as dangerous, theysay. Scouts and observers worry about being blown to bitswhen, fatigued from their mission and ready to let theirguard down, they are close enough to their lines to be seen,but too far away to be identified as friendly.   To survive the return trip, each team has its own codeword or phrase that identifies the speaker as a member ofthat team. Still, it is always perilous to approach the linesfrom the direction of the enemy. They can only hope thattheir code has been understood through the dust, smoke, noiseand confusion of warfare.   &quot;Scouts are on the edge all the time,&quot; says Capt. JeffHicks, the 29-year-old commander of a scout troop. &quot;You don'tknow who's going to end up shooting at you.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
