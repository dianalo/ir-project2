The hot pressing step being characterized bythe lithium carbonate being uniformly dispersed throughout the mixtureand affixed to the beryllium oxide particulates and converting to lithiumoxide during the hot pressing step to provide essentially uniform sinteringof the beryllium oxide particulates for providing the article with essentiallyuniform density.</TEXT></DOC>
