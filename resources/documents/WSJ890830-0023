Economists at the IMF also said that although the risk of a &quot;dangerous&quot; acceleration of inflation still exists, &quot;it appears to have diminished somewhat&quot; and inflationary pressures are expected to continue easing gradually through the end of next year.    But the IMF warned that governments mustn't be tempted into prematurely relaxing their anti-inflationary monetary policies, arguing that this could rekindle inflation.    The IMF's latest projections call for a growth rate of 2.7% for the industrialized countries in 1990, slightly down from its estimate of 2.9% in April. The latest estimate is likely to be revised in the coming weeks, however, partly reflecting faster-than-expected growth in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
