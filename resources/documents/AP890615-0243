The Federal Home Loan Bank Board placed Western Savings and Loanand Sun State Savings and Loan into receivership of the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp.   The FSLIC in turn named the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. asmanaging agent of each thrift, officials announced Wednesday.   FDIC officials said the thrifts will maintain normal operationsas federal mutual savings and loans. All depositors will continue tobe protected up to the $100,000 insured limit.   However, the FDIC said the receiverships relieve both Western andSun State of their stock and subordinated debt obligations. ``Thetwo new institutions also did not assume any obligations to thestockholders of the insolvent thrifts,'' the agency said.   ``You invest your savings and in a day they take it away. It'srough.'' said a Western investor who attended the news conferenceand who declined to be identified.   FDIC spokesman Alan J. Whitney blamed the Phoenix area'sdepressed real estate economy for much of the troubles of Arizonafinancial institutions. He said 35 percent of Arizona's banks lostmoney last year, the highest percentage in the nation.   Acting State Banking Superintendent William H. Rivoir III saidWestern and Sun State were taken into receivership to conserveremaining assests.   ``It's certainly no coincidence that approximately $9 million ofthe institution (Western) would have been paid to the bondholderstommorrow,'' Rivoir said when asked about the timing of the seizure.   Western, which is Arizona's second largest thrift, had beenscheduled to decide today whether it would make a $9 million paymenton $155 million worth of subordinated notes.   On April 30, Western had $5.78 billion in assets and $5.99billion in liabilities, and on May 31 was $85.8 million below therequired capital level, the FDIC said. Sun State on April 30 had$1.06 billion in assets and $1.09 billion in liabilities, and on May31 was $2.72 million below the required capital level, the agencysaid.   Virginia Judues, named the FDIC's managing agent for Western,said while she would consult with Western Chairman Robert Stallings,the financial decisions would be made by the government.   Ms. Judues said the FDIC is in the process of setting up anadvisory board to manage the thrift. Western will limit itsreal-estate lending to financing single-family residences.   Herbert Chin, who like Ms. Judues is a senior liquidationspecialist with the FDIC in San Francisco, was named Sun State'smanaging agent.   Both thrifts recently were placed under new management afterregulators forced the ouster of previous executives.</TEXT></DOC>
