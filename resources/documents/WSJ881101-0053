The central banks of the U.S. and Japan took action repeatedly throughout trading yesterday in the Far East, Europe and New York. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 125.65 yen, little changed from 125.63 late Friday. But at one point, in the middle of the European trading day, the U.S. currency fell as low as 124.55 yen, its weakest since last May.    But the intervention caused a split in the foreign exchange market. While the dollar recovered lost ground against the yen, it actually rose against the West German mark -- despite a conviction that the U.S. currency is generally headed lower. The dollar rose to 1.7868 West German marks from 1.7713 marks late Friday.    In Tokyo on Tuesday, the dollar opened at 125.88 yen, up from Monday's close of 125 yen.    Separately, the Canadian dollar was hammered sharply lower, after polls showed that the ruling Conservative Party had lost its lead in the national elections scheduled for Nov. 21. It was quoted at 81.51 cents, down 1.8% from 83.04 cents on Friday. Meanwhile, the British pound declined to $1.7688 from $1.7715 on Friday.    &quot;It's a very, very nervous market,&quot; said Jack Kessler, senior vice president in charge of Chase Manhattan Bank's New York foreign exchange operations.    Traders remain generally bearish on the U.S. currency, mostly because of the persistently high U.S. trade deficit and recent evidence of a slowing economy. But they are afraid that if they try to drive down the dollar too far and too fast, they'll be bushwhacked by the central banks.    Complicating matters for the dollar is next Tuesday's presidential election. Mr. Kessler of Chase Manhattan speculated that the Reagan administration could be trying to stabilize markets before the election.    Dealers said that the Bank of Japan repeatedly purchased small amounts of dollars in early Tokyo activity when the U.S. currency was trading at about 125.75 yen. But the dollar resumed declining in European markets, which traders described as thin and choppy ahead of holidays today in several major European countries.    When the dollar nonetheless kept falling, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reportedly bought dollars at 124.80 yen. The currency quickly shot up to 125.10 yen as word of the Fed's action spread. As is its custom, the Fed declined to confirm or deny it had intervened.    Traders estimated that the Fed has purchased about $200 million and the Bank of Japan less than $300 million -- not enough to turn a market around permanently but sufficient to frighten it.    Mr. Kessler said: &quot;The market was so nervous and so short dollars that a panic set in and everybody started stepping over each other to buy their dollars back.&quot;    That was especially the case against the mark -- even though both the Fed and Bank of Japan were selling yen, not marks, for dollars.    On Friday, dealers had tried to push the dollar above 1.79 marks and couldn't. So yesterday, they tried pushing it lower. But &quot;there was an inability to push the dollar below 1.7640 in a market that was already very short dollars,&quot; said Victor M. Polce, a vice president at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. The combination of the intervention and the short-covering, he added, resulted in a rally that drove the dollar even higher than where it stood on Friday.    &quot;Everybody's bearish on the buck,&quot; said Mr. Polce. &quot;Technically, this dollar's grossly oversold on a near-term basis.&quot;    The Canadian dollar reacted to political developments. Over the weekend, three separate polls came out indicating that Canada's Liberal Party was tied with the incumbent Conservative Party, a strong surge for the Liberals. &quot;None {of the polls} were very pleasing to the Conservative Party,&quot; said James Scalfaro, a marketing representative for the Bank of Montreal in New York.    Dealers said the Bank of Canada tried to support its currency through intervention in nervous Far Eastern markets early yesterday morning.    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has backed Canada's trade pact with the U.S., which over time would create a free-trade economic zone between the two countries. But Mr. Scalfaro said that the Conservative Party would have to win the election with a majority to ensure that Canada's parliament supports the agreement. &quot;A lot of foreign money is invested in the Canadian stock and bond markets -- money that could leave with a loss of confidence,&quot; he said.    Manfred Kunert, general manager in charge of foreign exchange operations at DG Bank in Frankfurt expressed traders' near-term bearish sentiment toward the dollar. &quot;It's still vulnerable,&quot; he said, predicting that the U.S. currency would trade between 1.73 and 1.7850 marks and between 122.50 to 126.25 yen before the presidential election.    After that, it depends on who wins. But much of Europe's financial community appears to believe it will be Vice President George Bush. &quot;It's not only a Wall Street bet but a European bet that Mr. Bush is going to make it,&quot; said Mr. Kunert. The dollar's path after the election, he added, &quot;will very much depend on {Mr. Bush's} first comments on the international economy, exchange-rate stability -- and the market will react accordingly.&quot;    Nonetheless, Mr. Kunert noted that general market sentiment in Europe called for the dollar to slowly slide to 1.60-to-1.65 marks until after the end of the year.    Now, however, traders in Europe appear to be more bearish than European investors. Mr. Kunert and others said that most foreign-currency denominated funds holding a lot of dollars weren't hedging their U.S. currency exposures. Mr. Kunert also said that multinational corporations weren't heavy sellers of dollars, either. Both, he said, &quot;are looking at long-term investments and are very happy with the bond yields they get on U.S. dollars.&quot;    Mr. Polce of Bear Stearns also is relatively positive about the currency. &quot;The short-covering coupled with the fact that the Fed was intervening has eliminated any sort of downward acceleration of the dollar in the near-term -- particularly in light of the fact that the U.S. election is one week away,&quot; he said.    Thus, Mr. Polce believes the dollar should trade in the low 1.80-mark range by week's end.    In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $412.20 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
