This amendment would add an arrival area extension to provide controlledairspace for protection of IFR aircraft executing an NDB SIAP planned forRunway 9L at the Miami International Airport. Interested parties were invitedto participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written commentson the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal werereceived. This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Section71.171 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished inFAA Handbook 7400.6E dated January 3, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule </ITAG>This amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations adds an arrivalarea extension to the Miami, Florida, Control Zone. This action will provideadditional controlled airspace for protection of IFR aircraft executinga new NDB Runway 9L Standard Instrument Approach Procedure to the MiamiInternational Airport based on the Cook NDB. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; Februrary26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will not affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certifiedthat this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Control zones. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, Part 71 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) is amended, as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS </ITAG>1.
