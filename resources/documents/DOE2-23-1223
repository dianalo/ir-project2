This embrittlementis observed when the oxygen is added during the initial melt processingor subsequently during high temperature air anneals. For gamma-prime-strengthenedsuperalloys, the elevated temperature ductility loss becomes significantfor oxygen levels above about 50-100 ppm. Typical oxygen contaminationlevels for rapidly solidified nickel-base alloys are about 40 ppm forspray formings, less than 100 ppm for coarse powder, and more than 400ppm for low pressure plasma deposits. The ductility losses observed forthe latter are signicant. For boron-doped nickel aluminides, the hightemperature embrittlement is severe. While conventional castings exhibit10 percent ductility at 800 C, all the rapid solidification productsexhibit less than 1 percent ductility and intergranular fracture. However,the data are complicated by the thermomechanical processing of the castings.When the rapidly solidified products are cold worked and annealed, theelevated temperature ductility improves. 45 references.</TEXT></DOC>
