The move is a bid to enhance the connectivity of Apple's personal computers with other companies' machines.    Terms of the investment weren't disclosed, but both companies said the link is meant to enable Apple's Macintosh computers to use Touch's so-called open-systems interconnect software. That program would allow Apple machines to exchange data with computers made by International Business Machines Corp. and their clones as well as those made by Digital Equipment Corp.    Apple has placed a strategic priority on improving the compatibility of its machines with other producers' computers. Such linking will allow Apple's computers to run a larger variety of software applications, and to better compete in the lucrative business-microcomputing market currently dominated by IBM machines and their clones.    Apple said it financed the investment in Scotts Valley, Calif.-based Touch with venture capital from its strategic investment group, a unit created last year to invest in smaller companies that have strategic potential for Apple.    &quot;Touch is an important element in our overall connectivity strategy,&quot; said Dan Eilers, director of the strategic investment group. </TEXT></DOC>
