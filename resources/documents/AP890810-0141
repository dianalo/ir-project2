Fitzwater suggested it was premature to expect such contacts atthis point. ``We're nowhere near that,'' he said.   Still, the spokesman said, ``We would not be ruling out directdiscussions at some future point.''   The United States severed diplomatic ties with Tehran in theaftermath of Iran's seizing of U.S. Embassy hostages a decade ago.   Meanwhile Thursday, U.S. officials welcomed reports thatPakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan would go to Tehrannext week and be willing to serve as an intermediary in indirecttalks between this nation and Iran.   A senior administration official said Pakistan's role could becritical in persuading Iran to pressure pro-Iranian groups intoreleasing kidnapped Americans and Westerners held in Lebanon.   ``Pakistan is a Moslem country with access and ties to otherMoslem countries, and with special knowledge of Iran'sinvolvement'' in the hostage situation, said the official, whodeclined to be identified.   A spokesman at the Pakistan Embassy said that ``Since Pakistanhas good relations with both Iran and the United States, if askedPakistan would be willing to mediate in the hostage crisis.'' Thespokesman, who said he could not be identified under hisgovernment's rules, added he was unable to confirm or deny whetherPakistan has already been an intermediary between Iran and theUnited States.   The English-language Tehran Times said in a report on Thursdaythat indirect talks between Iran and the United States on thehostage crisis would be undertaken through a third country,probably Pakistan.   Fitzwater observed that some third-country discussions alreadyhad taken place but added: ``We are encouraging talks of everykind.''   He said Khan and other Pakistani officials ``do have contacts inIran'' and it was the administration's policy ``to leave no stoneunturned'' in seeking to win freedom of the U.S. hostages.   Of Khan's trip, Fitzwater said he could not supply details.``There's a lot of unknowns regarding his trip and his purposes.''   Khan made an unexpected visit to Washington last week, where hemet on the hostage situation with Vice President Dan Quayle,according to Quayle spokesman David Beckwith.   ``Vice President Quayle urged Pakistan to become involved inhelping facilitate the release of the hostages and to reveal toIran information that Pakistan has accumulated on the situation.''   ``Pakistan is one of the countries that we're looking to forhelp,'' Beckwith added.   The Tehran Times said that indirect talks between Iran and theUnited States on the hostages would begin within days, the officialIslamic Republic News Agency reported.   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted the paper as saying,``Political observers believed that in the next few days we shouldexpect certain moves towards mediation, of course unofficially.''   At the State Department, Margaret Tutwiler noted that ``wealready have indirect communications with the government of Iran,''primarily through the Swiss government.   On the possibility of direct contact, she said: ``The U.S.government is prepared to engage in a dialogue with authorizedrepresentatives of the government of Iran to discuss the issuesthat divide us.''   ``However, any improvement in relations with Iran depends uponthat government's stopping its support for terrorism and takingaction to bring about the immediate, unconditional and safe releaseof U.S. citizens held hostage by Iranian-supported groups inLebanon,'' she added.   Both Fitzwater and Ms. Tutwiler said that a willingness to talkdirectly with Iran on issues dividing the two nations was not a newU.S. policy.   For direct talks to take place, he said, ``we would want to besure of the authoritative nature of our contacts. We would want tohave some clear understanding of what we wanted to say to them andof their interest in having those discussions.''   ``I have not heard any interest from Iran in having directtalks, and that is a major factor as well,'' Fitzwater added.   Bush himself made no comment on the hostage matter, passing upan opportunity to discuss the situation during an appearance in theRose Garden where he announced the selection of Army Gen. ColinPowell as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   Meanwhile, Fitzwater told reporters the United States and Israelwere consulting with each other about efforts to free theirhostages in Lebanon, but were not coordinating their efforts.   Israeli officials had said Israel's Prime Minister YitzhakShamir persuaded Bush in a 10-minute telephone call Wednesday tocoordinate efforts to release foreign hostages and Israeliprisoners held in Lebanon.   ``We've generally tried to be forthcoming with what we aredoing, and they have been forthcoming with what they're doing.However, I would not characterize it as coordination,'' Fitzwatersaid.</TEXT></DOC>
