From 1982 to 1989, the multinationals' U.S. employmentrose only 0.1% to 18.72 million, while their overseasemployment fell 0.3% to 6.62 million workers.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This refutes the whole concept of {multinationalcorporations} exporting jobs,&quot; said Antonio Villamil, theCommerce Department's chief economist.   Other economists said the figures weren't conclusive,partly because the stability of overall employment levelsmask a number of significant changes in various industriesand regions.   U.S. firms operating in Asia and in Mexico, for instance,added substantially to their work forces in the 1980s. InJapan, U.S. firms increased employment by 28% to 388,000. InThailand, they more than doubled employment to 60,000. And inMexico, they rose by nearly 10% to 516,000.   In contrast, the divestiture of operations in South Africasharply reduced the number of employees of U.S. affiliatesthere to 38,000 in 1989 from 136,000 in 1982.   Other Commerce Department data also undermine the argumentthat multinationals are exporting production for the U.S.market overseas to avoid U.S. labor costs, said RaymondMataloni Jr., a department economist. At the end of the1980s, he said, imports from foreign affiliates accounted forslightly more than 4% of their domestic sales, up onlyslightly from 3% at the beginning of the decade.   Among multinational manufacturers, employment at home fellnearly 4% to 10.14 million, while falling 6% to 4.19 millionoverseas. Overall, roughly 30% of multinationals' work forceswere overseas in both 1982 and 1989.   The patterns vary by industry. Among U.S. multinationalmanufacturers of electric and electronic equipment, forinstance, employment at home fell 37% to 1.02 million, whileoverseas employment dropped 4% to 650,000.   Multinational corporations are disproportionatelymanufacturers, and U.S. manufacturing employment hasn't grownmuch over the past decade as foreign competitors have takenmarket share in some industries and automation has eliminatedjobs in others. From 1982 to 1989, employment at all U.S.businesses -- including those in the service sector, whichgrew rapidly in the 1980s -- rose 22% from 1982 to 1989, theCommerce Department said.   The new data is based on reports from 2,167 U.S. parentcompanies and their 17,842 foreign affiliates. They cover allcompanies abroad in which U.S. firms hold at least a 10%interest; those with assets, sales or net income of less than$3 million aren't covered.   The overseas employment numbers may be distorted bycorporate decisions to buy or sell minority interests inforeign companies; a sale of a minority interest in a foreignunit shows up as a decline in employment overseas.</TEXT></DOC>
