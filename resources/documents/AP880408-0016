JohnF. Kerry says.   The Foreign Relations subcommittee headed by Kerry, D-Mass., hasheard a week of testimony about the daring night-time flights andhuge profits made by cocaine and marijuana traffickers, along withallegations that U.S. officials knew about some of the traffickingbut did nothing to halt it.   Two convicted drug smugglers testified Thursday that weaponswere illegally flown to Costa Rica for the Contras and hundreds ofpounds of cocaine were brought back on the return flights. TheContras have denied that they were involved in illegal drugtrafficking.   ``I think it is important to look at the link between theContras and drugs,'' Kerry said Thursday, ``but this is not meantto be focused on the Contra effort. The issue is whether a specificforeign policy goal (aiding the Contras) assumed a larger-than-lifeimportance so that some things were permitted that should not havebeen.''   Kerry chairs the Foreign Relations subcommittee on narcotics andterrorism, which is investigating the relationship between LatinAmerican governments and the drug trade.   ``I think what we've shown is that there is an enormous amountmore that needs to be done to improve enforcement of the druglaws,'' said Kerry. ``You can't ever stop it, but you can slow itdown with more effective enforcement.''   Gary Betzner, who is serving a 27-year prison sentence for drugtrafficking, testified Thursday that he had twice flown planeloadsof weapons from Florida to Costa Rica in July 1984. The weaponswere replaced with hundreds of pounds of cocaine, he said.   As Betzner described his career flying illegal drugs from SouthAmerica, he described a series of high-risk trips in which he flewat wave-top level to avoid radar.   He said that on one occasion, he entered Miami by flying betweenhigh-rise condominium buildings along the city's coastline. Onanother occasion, he said, mechanical and navigational troublesforced him to fly over Cuba, where he was chased by MiG-19 jetsuntil he dived down to tree-top level.   The profits were huge, according to Betzner, who said he waspaid to $200,000 per planeload for delivering drugs to the UnitedStates.   Betzner's story was echoed by George Morales, a Colombian nativewho says he began dealing drugs in 1979. Within several years, hehad made enough money to build an empire that included a fleet of10 to 15 planes, helicopters, and speedy boats.   Betzner is serving a 27-year prison term for cocainetrafficking, while Morales is doing a 16-year term for hisconviction on the same charge.   Morales said he gave the Contras ``several million dollars''from his drug profits. On one occasion, he estimated the amount atbetween $3 million and $4 million, but he later said the figure was$5 million to $6 million.   Morales also said he arranged six times between 1984 and 1986 toship weapons from the United States to the Contras because he saidContra officials who claimed to be CIA operatives promised to tryto get drug charges dropped against him.   Both Morales and Betzner said the weapons were delivered to anairstrip near a northern Costa Rican ranch owned by John Hull, anAmerican who has been linked to both the Contras and the CIA.   Hull met the plane each time and watched as the small arms,including M-16 rifles, mines and C-4 explosives, were unloaded,Betzner said. The plane was then loaded with cocaine, Betzner said,and he flew back to Florida. He estimated that he carried about 500kilograms (1,100 pounds) of cocaine on each return flight.   ABC News on Thursday described a network that it said shippedEastern European arms to the Contras and Latin American drugs tothe United States.   Citing unidentified U.S., Panamanian and Israeli sources, thenetwork said that from 1983 to 1986 Israeli agents, with U.S.financial support, purchased arms in Poland and Czechoslovakia,shipped them from Yugoslavia to Bolivia and on to Panama.   From there, the network said, the arms were flown to Contrasupply drops in El Salvador and Costa Rica. ABC said the sameplanes and pilots then flew illegal drugs from Panama and Colombiato the United States.   The network said the operation was launched with $20 million inIsraeli government money, which was later reimbursed from U.S.covert funds.   ABC said Michael Harreri, an Israeli liaison who also served asan aide to Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, was themiddleman. It said former CIA agent Felix Rodriguez was theAmerican connection.   ABC said the Israeli government denied Thursday that it suppliedarms to the Contras and Rodriguez has denied he was involved insuch a supply network.</TEXT></DOC>
