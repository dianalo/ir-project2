Based on the experimental results and resultsof the calculation of the interaction parameter and coefficient of activityit is shown that the system tends to separation into layers. Loss ofmass of volatile components under liquid-phase epitaxy is evaluated,and it is shown that change in the composition due to bismuth evaporationshould be necessarily taken into account.</TEXT></DOC>
