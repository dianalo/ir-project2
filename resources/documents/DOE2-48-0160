This system uses nodes arranged in each lineto take field data for protection and control and employs a token-ringtransmission system to transmit such data. The proposal pertains to amethod of collecting field data necessary to execute protection and controlfunctions by using the nodes and a method of sampling synchronization.As an additional function of the nodes, the authors propose a reliabilitymonitoring method based on the mutual comparison of field data for protectionwith that for control. To realize the time-fixed transmission and simultaneoustransmission of sampling synchronous signals, the authors propose methodsof using the broadcast transmission function at the transmitter sideand the transmission-inhibiting function at the receiver side. To compensatesampling synchronous error, the authors propose multi-frame transmissionand receiver-side clock and proved that it works well with regard toprotection operations precision.
