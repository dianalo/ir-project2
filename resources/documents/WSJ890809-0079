The Louisville, Colo., maker of data storage equipment said the action wasn't in response to any effort to acquire the company.    The common stock rights plan, usually called a poison pill, allows current shareholders to buy Storage Technology stock at a discount if any person or group acquires at least 20% of the stock or announces a tender offer for at least 30% of the stock. The percentages could be lowered to 10% at the board's discretion. In addition, if a person or group acquires more than 50% of its assets or if the company is involved in a merger, shareholders could buy stock in the acquiring company at a discount. </TEXT></DOC>
