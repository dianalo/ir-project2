A State Department official met with Afghan rebel leaders inPakistan last week to explain the American position, The New YorkTimes reported.   Another top State Department official described the criteria forAmerican support of a provisional government as ``control ofterritory, consent of the people, capacity and willingness toexercise international obligations, possession of a civiladministrative apparatus that can govern.''   Such a government ``would have earned recognition from theinternational community,'' The Times quoted the official as saying.   Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet Unionsigned agreements in Geneva last month providing for the withdrawalof Soviet troops from Afghanistan over the next nine months.   The Soviet Union has reserved the right to continue its longtimesupport of the government in Kabul, but the State Departmentofficial told the Times the Soviet troop withdrawal ``willinevitably lead to a change of government because ... it's theRussian presence that keeps the current government in power.''</TEXT></DOC>
