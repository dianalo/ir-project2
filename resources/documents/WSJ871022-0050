Investors RethinkP/E Ratios, Fancy Gauges Like Asset Values---By Linda Sandler</HL><DD> 10/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> HEARD ON THE STREET (HRD)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)RETAILING (RET)AUTOS, AUTO PARTS (AUT) </IN><TEXT>   As J.P. Morgan said, stock prices will continue to fluctuate.    Yesterday, stocks soared as investors euphorically put aside fears of a 1988 recession and faltering company earnings. But it's clear from the week's recent downdrafts and updrafts in stock prices -- although magnified by computerized trading -- that people keep changing their minds about what stocks are really worth. Monday's devaluation of stocks won't be the last if recession worries revive.    In August, investors were paying a price-earnings multiple of 18 for stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, using Morgan Stanley's 1987 profit estimate. The Dow's P/E late Monday was 11.5 and yesterday was 13.4. Caterpillar's P/E has shrunk from 1987's peak of 32 to 22; Limited's, from 31 to 13; and Coca-Cola's, from 22 to 17, using Value Line earnings estimates.    Earnings multiples, a gauge of what investors are willing to pay for future earnings and dividends, are a common valuation tool. But people also have been rethinking fancier measures like cash-flow multiples, asset values and prices paid for businesses by savvy investors.    Salomon traded in the 30s in September when Warren Buffett agreed to buy a big stake; it was at 25 yesterday. Assets of Carl Icahn's TWA Corp. earlier this year were valued at around $45 a share; yesterday the stock closed at 19. After ending TWA's bid to go private, Mr. Icahn said yesterday he'd buy TWA shares in the open market.    What caused these shifting valuations? Brokerage stocks, of course, are in the eye of the storm on Wall Street; people believe the firms will lose their shirts on their trading operations, says Harvey Eisen of Integrated Asset Management. And it turns out that asset values aren't considered meaningful if there isn't a buyer for the assets.    Moreover, there have been intermittent worries that high interest rates might choke the economy. Wildly swinging stock prices could compound the damage, analysts say, by making doctors, yuppies and others uncertain of their spending power.    Few Wall Street professionals currently predict a recession. But if there's a slowdown, says an executive at a big retail brokerage, corporate profits could shrink 10% to 50% from 1987 levels. Thus stock prices would have to fall further just to maintain P/Es.    But P/Es generally shrink if the economy falters. Investors don't pay high multiples for stocks if they don't foresee much profit growth, says Byron Wien, a Morgan Stanley investment strategist. From 1972 to 1975, years of economic uncertainty, Caterpillar's P/E shrank from 16 to 9, and Limited's, from 23 to 7.    Morgan Stanley is reviewing all its 1988 earnings estimates. But it currently puts the profit of stocks in the Sandamp;P 500-stock index at $22 a share, a 24% gain over 1987. Such profit growth merits a P/E of 16, compared with 11.7 currently, Mr. Wien believes. But if the economy slows in 1988, Sandamp;P-500 profit might be only $17 a share, basically flat with recent years, and P/Es would be lower, he says.    Most analysts look on the bright side, Mr. Wien says. Sandamp;P-500 companies &quot;are always supposed to earn $20 a share&quot; annually but have actually averaged $17 a share in the 1980s, he says.    Some people say stocks haven't yet come down to earth. &quot;They were in the ionosphere, now they're only in the stratosphere,&quot; says Scott Black of Delphi Management, a Boston money manager.    One rule of thumb: Stocks are deemed fairly priced when earnings yields -- per-share profit divided by price -- equal yields on quality corporate bonds. For the Sandamp;P yield to compete with double-A-rated bonds, currently yielding more than 10.5%, its P/E must fall quite a bit, Mr. Black says.    Charles Clough, a Merrill Lynch investment strategist, says retail, auto and financial service stocks still look notably overvalued. Monday's traumatic stock sell-off won't help consumer spending, he says. He predicts more &quot;markdowns&quot; of analysts' earnings estimates for consumer companies.    Stocks often fall before profit estimates fall, of course. Limited's stock dived in recent months before analysts generally dropped their 1987 and 1988 estimates for the company.    Of course, investors' sudden revaluations of stocks can be emotional, and are never based solely on fundamentals.    Morgan Stanley's Mr. Wien says Monday's sell-off was &quot;the cracking of a dream that we could muddle through&quot; the problems of the U.S. budget and trade deficits. Yesterday, stocks were marked up almost indiscriminately as the dream, if that's what it was, revived.    Because of program trading, moreover, quality stocks included in major market indexes, like Merck, are unfairly jerked around, says Linda Newman, a money manager at Atalanta Capital. Analysts' 1988 estimates for Merck have recently been rising, she says, yet its P/E has contracted.    But valuations usually change at times of economic uncertainty, because people worry that stocks may lose their magical ability to enrich shareholders. Coke's P/E fell from 42 to 20 between 1972 and 1975, as high-flying &quot;Nifty Fifty&quot; shares lost favor.    Amid the market's current volatility, one thing's sure, says Integrated Asset's Mr. Eisen: &quot;You will get an unbelievable opportunity to make or lose more money.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
