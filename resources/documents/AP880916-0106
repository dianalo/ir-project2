Fleeing residents crowded into shelters as the storm pushedacross the gulf carrying 120 mph winds. The hurricane left 17people dead on the Yucatan Peninsula, officials said. Ten peoplewere reported missing, and hundreds of thousands were driven fromtheir homes on the battered peninsula.   ``We're seeing the first victims. The gulf area is flooding andwe're getting rains and wind,'' said Hector Flores of the citypress office, as Gilbert's outer band pounded the coast with heavyrain.   The city in a news release said at least 10,000 people spent thenight in shelters set up at schools, churches and public buildings.Countless others fled homes in low-lying and poor areas. At least5,000 people were rendered homeless near Matamoros.   Sporadic rains and wind gusts of up to 35 mph were felt today asofficials hustled to complete evacuating residents from thelowlands of the Laguna Madre area and the fishing town of La Pesca,both north of the Yucatan.   The shelters were being stocked with blankets, food and waterfor up to 70,000 people. When the 450-mile-wide hurricane slammedinto the Caribbean resort of Cancun Wednesday, winds topped 160 mph.   ``An indescribable, desolate panorama'' was how Ranulfo Garza ofNovedades de Yucatan described first reports today from isolatedtowns along Yucatan's north coast. ``It looks like an earthquakestruck instead of a hurricane. The destruction is incredible.''   Garza said dozens of homes in Progreso were damaged ordestroyed. Beaches were reconfigured or simply disappeared duringthe storm, appliances and furniture floated in empty streets, andlarge fishing vessels and yachts were deposited on land or ``piledtogether like logs.''   The storm left about 300,000 people homeless in Yucatan stateand another 10,000 homeless in Campeche, the government news agencyNotimex said today. Merida remained without electricity and longlines formed for drinking water outside government buildings.   In Matamoros, as shelters began filling up, one woman said shehad nowhere else to turn.   ``Our house is very old, and it isn't any good. It could fall ontop of us,'' said Guadalupe Flores Martinez, 56, who stood with herfamily in the gusting wind outside a shelter at a local gradeschool.   A steady stream of traffic jammed the highway leading inland asthe hurricane threatened to strike the gulf coast just 20 milesfrom Matamoros, a city of about 280,000 people south ofBrownsville, Texas.   The National Weather Service in Miami said if Gilbert continuedin the same direction, it would strike the coast near theTexas-Mexico border sometime this evening.   Luis Montiel, spokesman for the Tamaulipas state government,said that in the oil port of Tampico, with a population of about700,000, people were evacuated from low-lying marshy areas tohigher ground. Tampico lies about 200 miles south of Matamoros.   U.S. and Mexican officials opened floodgates in dams on the RioGrande to prevent flash floods downriver once the storm hit.   The hurricane left much of the Yucatan without communication,electricity or drinking water after it hit Wednesday. Most roadswere blocked and supplies were running low. Airports in Cancun,Cozumel and Chetumal were opened only to aircraft with emergencysupplies, while commercial flights remained suspended.   Campeche's governor declared the state a disaster area Thursdayand appealed for relief supplies.   In Campeche, the state capital on the peninsula's west coast,two babies drowned as residents of a poor, low-lying neighborhoodtried to flee, said Omar Cantu, editor of the Novedades de Campeche.   Seven other people died, three by drowning and four when a wallcollapsed on them in the town of Dzidzantun north of Merida,officials said.   Red Cross worker Victor Rodriguez Santamaria said rescue effortswere hampered by flooding, lack of power and gasoline.   Tourism Secretary Enriquez Savignac said eight people werekilled in Cancun.   Thousands of tourists in Yucatan resort areas were stranded.Local officials said 11,000 tourists and residents were evacuatedfrom Cancun, and the Mexican navy began evacuating tourists fromthe resort island of Cozumel.   The government oil monopoly Pemex suspended foreign exports ofcrude oil, secured tankers and capped wells on platforms along thewestern gulf coast.</TEXT></DOC>
