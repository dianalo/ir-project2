The case will give the justices an opportunity todetermine how far communities may go in regulating expressionthat reflects bias or hatred based on race, religion or sex.</LP><TEXT>   The high court has been sharply divided in recent yearsover how much constitutional protection must be given tocontroversial acts that could be considered symbolic forms ofspeech. In the past two years, the justices struck downfederal and state laws that made it illegal to burn a U.S.flag. But those two rulings came on 5-4 votes. JusticeWilliam Brennan, a liberal who wrote those opinions, hasretired and his seat has been taken by the more conservativeJustice David Souter.   &quot;Given Souter's appointment, all bets are off&quot; in thisarea of First Amendment interpretation, said Michael Seidman,a law professor at Georgetown University.   The Supreme Court will review a decision of the MinnesotaSupreme Court upholding the constitutionality of a St. Paulordinance that bars such acts of prejudice as burning a crossor painting a Nazi swastika. The local law was challenged bya teenager arrested on charges of burning a cross in a blackfamily's yard last June.   The St. Paul ordinance prohibits any act on public orprivate property &quot;which one knows or has reasonable groundsto know arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others on thebasis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; A trialcourt judge, citing the Supreme Court's flag-burningdecisions, dismissed a charge of disorderly conduct on theground that the ordinance censors constitutionally protectedexpressive conduct.   But the state supreme court unanimously reversed the trialjudge's ruling. The state supreme court concluded that &quot;theburning cross is itself an unmistakable symbol of violenceand hatred based on virulent notions of racial supremacy.&quot;The court acknowledged that the ordinance should have been&quot;more carefully drafted&quot; to make it clear that it appliesonly to expressive conduct likely to provoke &quot;imminentlawless action.&quot; But the court said the flaw didn't make thelaw unconstitutional because the ordinance could beinterpreted to apply only in the more narrow sense.   In his petition for U.S. Supreme Court review, thedefendant, a juvenile at the time of the incident who isidentified in court papers as R.A.V., argued that the statecourt's interpretation would stifle all sorts ofcontroversial expression. Supporting that view, Philip Gutisof the American Civil Liberties Union said, &quot;Localities andcities shouldn't be in the business of trying to define whatthe First Amendment protects when it comes to expressiveconduct.&quot; The cross-burning case &quot;really is an extension ofthe flag-burning cases,&quot; Mr. Gutis added.   A number of states and cities have passed laws barringhate crimes, and many college campuses are embroiled indisputes over restrictions on &quot;offensive&quot; speech. It isn'tclear whether the Supreme Court's decision in the Minnesotacase will cover situations that involve only speech, asopposed to expressive conduct. It also isn't clear whetherthe high court will make a broad constitutionalinterpretation about the regulation of prejudicial expressionor whether the justices will address only the specific andrather unambiguous message conveyed by burning a cross nearthe home of a black family.</TEXT></DOC>
