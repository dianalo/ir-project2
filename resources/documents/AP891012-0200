(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Technicians worked six at a time ina cramped engine compartment Thursday to remove a flawed computerin time to meet a Tuesday target for launching the shuttle Atlantisand its Galileo space probe.   The workers had to stand on platforms to unhook the computer soit can be replaced Friday with a spare that will be tested forabout 16 hours.   ``The odds are still 50-50 that we'll be able to make a Tuesdaylaunch,'' said NASA spokesman Karl Kristofferson. Space agencyofficials said they would decide Saturday whether to delay liftoffuntil Wednesday.   Liftoff on Tuesday is scheduled for 12:57 p.m., the start of a24-minute period in which the planet Jupiter will be in the properposition to nearly cross paths with the Galileo spacecraft in 1995.Wednesday has a 27-minute launch window, and Nov. 21 is the lastday Jupiter will be in the proper position until mid-1991.   After launch, Atlantis' crew of five astronauts is to releasethe 6,700-pound probe for the six-year journey to Jupiter.   The launch originally was scheduled for Thursday, but NASApostponed the flight Tuesday after the engine computer, called amaster controller, gave a false fuel pump pressure reading.   Similar computers are located in the shuttle's other two mainengines. They each weigh 230 pounds, cost $6 million and controlall functions of their individual powerplant during the climb intoorbit.   Had NASA tried to launch Atlantis Thursday as originallyplanned, the effort would have been halted by bad weather,officials said. Clouds and high winds prevailed throughout the day,with intermittant rain.   The astronauts were at their main training base in Houston onThursday, rehearsing in a shuttle simulator.   A federal judge rejected a request by environmental groups tohalt the flight for fear the nuclear-powered probe could scatterplutonium over Florida if the shuttle exploded.   The groups filed a notice with the judge Thursday that they weregoing to appeal his ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals.   The West German Green Party, which focuses on environmentalissues, is asking to join in legal actions to delay the launch. Ithopes to gain time to get the issue of the space shuttle's nuclearcargo before the world court.   ``Because of the shortness of time, they asked that we representthem,'' said Lanny Sinkin, a lawyer for the Christic Institute, oneof three U.S. environmental groups that tried to stop the launch.</TEXT></DOC>
