The developments deepened a growing rift between Iran's ShiiteMoslem government and the Sunni rulers of Saudi Arabia as bothcountries prepared for major religious events this week.   ``The Saudi regime which massacres in cold blood hundreds ofpilgrims near Allah's safe house is a terrorist,'' Tehran's officialIslamic Republic News Agency quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying.   Saudi officials say Iranian fundamentalists caused the July 10,1987, riots in which more than 400 mostly Iranian protesters died.Iran says its pilgrims were exercising their legitimate right to apolitical protest in Mecca, birthplace of the prophet Mohammed.   In Saudi Arabia on Monday, King Fahd called for heightenedsecurity around the annual Moslem pilgrimage, or hajj, to theshrines in Mecca and Medina, apparently fearing Iranian-instigatedtrouble.   Tehran Television, monitored in Nicosia, showed thousands ofIranians converging on the Imam Hussein square in downtown Tehranchanting: ``Mecca and Medina should be liberated!''   Thursday marks the end of the 40-day mourning period forAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3. The planned final massoutpouring of grief at his grave coincides with the climax of thepilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, the Eid al-Adha, or feast of sacrifice.   Iran claims the pilgrimage is being corrupted and has boycottedit for the second straight year.   Last year the Saudi government also introduced a quota systemlimiting the number of pilgrims to 1,000 per million of population,effectively cutting the usual Iranian contingent of 150,000 to about50,000.   Fahd's call for tighter security came days after a Saudieditorial rebuked Iran for introducing politics into a religiousfestival and for keeping its people away from the hajj, one of thefive duties of all Moslems.   Saudi Arabia severed relations with Tehran in April last year,citing subversion and terrorism.   The Shiite-Sunni rift evolved from the bloody 7th century fightover who would succeed Mohammed, founder of Islam, as leader of thereligion.</TEXT></DOC>
