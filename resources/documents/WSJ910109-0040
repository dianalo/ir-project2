Mr. Bush's request serves to draw a sharp line in thecoming debate over U.S. policy in the Mideast. While stoppingshort of seeking a declaration of war, he wants Congress togo on record backing the potential commitment of U.S. forcesto combat.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I am determined to do whatever is necessary to protectAmerica's security,&quot; Mr. Bush said in the two-page letterdelivered to House and Senate leaders. &quot;I ask Congress tojoin with me in this task.&quot;   The administration so far has left much of the job ofdrafting a resolution to its allies in Congress, but Mr. Bushmade clear that he wants broad discretion to achieve statedUnited Nations Security Council goals in the region. InNovember, the Security Council voted to authorize all U.N.member states &quot;to use all necessary means&quot; -- the same phraseMr. Bush proposed that Congress use in its resolution -- tocompel Iraq to withdraw.   Swift congressional approval of such a resolution &quot;wouldsend the clearest possible message that {Saddam Hussein} mustwithdraw without condition or delay from Kuwait,&quot; thepresident said in his letter. &quot;Anything less would onlyencourage Iraqi intransigence; anything else would riskdetracting from the international coalition arrayed againstIraq's aggression.&quot;   Mr. Bush's letter was delivered as Secretary of StateJames Baker arrived in Geneva for a crucial meeting todaywith Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. Amid growing gloomthat the meeting won't persuade Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait,Mr. Baker urged U.S. allies to send a uniform signal offirmness in any last-ditch diplomatic efforts to avert war.   Earlier in the day, Mr. Baker met with representatives ofFrance, Germany and Italy, seeking to prevent cracks in theanti-Iraq coalition. &quot;We welcome any and all efforts toresolve this matter peacefully,&quot; he said, &quot;provided thatthere is no mixing of the message.&quot; That message, which hesaid he will deliver to Mr. Aziz, is that Saddam Hussein mustmeet the Jan. 15 deadline to withdraw or be ejected fromKuwait by force.   Separately, Mr. Bush, in a videotaped message broadcast tothe nations joining the U.S. in the coalition, againthreatened war but indicated one might not start immediatelyafter the Jan. 15 deadline.   &quot;Let me be clear about the upcoming deadline,&quot; Mr. Bushsaid. &quot;Jan. 15 is not a date certain for the onset of armedconflict. It is a deadline for Saddam Hussein to choose, tochoose peace over war.&quot;   Mr. Baker's call for unity among the anti-Iraq nations wasaimed mainly at France, which has proposed that the coalitionagree to an international conference to discuss Mideastissues, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, if Iraqwithdraws from Kuwait.   French President Francois Mitterrand plans to hold a newsconference in Paris tonight following the Baker-Aziz meeting.There were reports Mr. Mitterrand may dispatch a seniorofficial to Baghdad, but the French president told Mr. Bakerhe hadn't yet made a decision.   Iraq has suggested it might withdraw in exchange for aresolution to other Mideast problems, but the Bushadministration rejects any such linkage. The only inducementit wants to offer Saddam Hussein is that the U.S.-ledcoalition arrayed against him won't attack Iraq if hewithdraws from Kuwait.   The congressional debate will be joined first in theHouse, where competing resolutions on Mideast policy areexpected to be brought to the floor Friday and Saturday.Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D., Wash.) favors continuingeconomic sanctions against Iraq rather than resorting now toforce, but the administration commands significant Democraticsupport for the use of force after Jan. 15.   House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante B. Fascell(D., Fla.) is seen as sympathetic to the president'sposition. Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspincontinues to stress the need for diplomatic initiatives, butsaid he would support sending U.S. forces into combat.   &quot;If all else fails, war is a reasonable option,&quot; said theWisconsin Democrat. A former McNamara &quot;whiz kid&quot; from theVietnam era, Mr. Aspin said he expected the U.S. to pursue aphased campaign relying initially on air attacks to driveIraqi forces from Kuwait. &quot;What is being planned is clearly aphased campaign,&quot; said Mr. Aspin, and though he said U.S.ground troops ultimately will be needed, he said he expectedno major commitment of ground forces for roughly the firstweek of any war, when the air option would be heavily used.   The support for the administration among senior chairmenin the House contrasts with the doubts in the Senate. There,Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) haswarned repeatedly of the need for caution, and theadministration could well face difficulties winning supportit needs from southern Democrats.   Sen. Charles Robb (D., Va.), the son-in-law of the latePresident Lyndon Johnson, has been courted by Mr. Bush and issympathetic to the White House, but Sen. Ernest Hollings (D.,S.C.) was scathingly critical of the White House policy lastweek and Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.) has yet to commithimself openly.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell welcomed thepresident's request for congressional action, but said hewon't support a resolution giving Mr. Bush &quot;a blank check tocommit the nation to war.&quot; Democratic senators will caucusthis afternoon on the issue, and though the president has theedge, he has yet to win over Sen. Nunn.   &quot;If we are patient, we can prevail without a large loss oflife and without the unforseen aftermath of even a successfulwar,&quot; said the Georgia Democrat last night. &quot;When it getsdown to a public vote on whether to give him {Mr. Bush} theauthority he wants, I believe it will pass,&quot; Mr. Nunn added.&quot;But it will be a close vote.&quot;   Lawmakers scheduled their own deliberations to begin aftertoday's Baker-Aziz meeting. Yesterday, the U.S. secretary ofstate was seeking to lower expectations for the session. At abrief news conference in Milan, Italy, he said nothing hadled him &quot;to conclude that Saddam Hussein has finally realizedthat the international community is indeed serious when theysay you must leave Kuwait.&quot;   That point appeared to be underscored in a U.S. televisioninterview with Mr. Aziz, who laughed off a question aboutwhether Iraq was ready to adhere to the U.N.-imposeddeadline. But when the Iraqi foreign minister arrived inGeneva last night, according to a Reuters report, he said hewanted to have &quot;positive, constructive talks&quot; with Mr. Baker.He continued to link those talks to other Mideast issues,though.</TEXT></DOC>
