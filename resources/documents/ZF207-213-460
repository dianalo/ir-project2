Congress. SenatePolitical Issues.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Insist on Ethics, but Don't Hamstring Public ServiceandM;The lack of individual ethics in government already this year has played acritical role in the futures of two of Washington's more prominentpoliticians -- House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas) and former Senate ArmedServices Committee chairman John Tower (R-Texas).andM;At issue are potential conflicts of interest that arise when governmentofficials are involved in commercial activities.andP;  Congress last year approveda bill banning former executive branch employees, including former presidentsand vice presidents, from advising clients on any issue in which they werepersonally and substantially involved while in government for two years afterthey leave the government.andM;It also would have banned executive branch employees from lobbying theirformer agencies for one year after leaving office.andP;  Former members ofCongress also would have been prohibited from lobbying House or Senatemembers for one year after leaving office.andM;President Reagan vetoed the bill, claiming it was excessive and containedlighter restrictions for Congress than for the executive branch.andP;  Backers ofthe bill have said they will introduce similar legislation this year.andM;A tougher Senate bill, S 1, would permanently ban executive branch employeesfrom advising on any issue in which they were personally and substantiallyinvolved while in government.andM;It also would prohibit for one year former members of Congress from lobbyingthe legislative branch and top executive branch officials; top levelofficials in the executive branch from lobbying the executive and legislativebranches; former senior executive branch officials (SES and GS-16 or higher)from lobbying their former agency and former senior congressional staffmembers (SES and GS-16 or higher) from lobbying in the house for which theyhad worked.andM;Don't Discourage ServiceandM;While there clearly is a need to insist on the highest ethical standards forour government officials, we also must recognize that many people sacrificelarge salaries and prestigious positions in the private sector to work forthe government.andP;  The government -- and the taxpayers -- need their uniqueapproaches to problems gained through years of industry experience to helpsteer the government in a positive direction.andP;  The restrictions imposed by S1 are too severe, I think, and will discourage people from working for thegovernment.andM;Rep.andP;  Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the original sponsor of last year's Houselegislation, has introduced a less excessive bill, HR 9, which places atwo-year restriction, rather than a permanent ban, on &quot;aiding and advising.&quot;andM;The bill would prohibit the president or vice president from contacting anyofficer or employee of the executive branch during the year after he or sheleaves office, and would place a one-year &quot;no-contact ban&quot; on Cabinetmembers, undersecretaries of major departments, assistant secretaries andcommissioners of independent regulatory commissions.andM;Former members of Congress and elected officers of both Houses would berequired to wait one year before lobbying, and personal congressional staffmembers (SES and GS-17 or higher) would have to wait a year before contactingtheir former offices on official matters.andM;Other House legislation deals with strengthening conflict of interestrestrictions in the Defense Department.andP;  HR 85, introduced by Rep.andP;  CharlesBennett (D-Fla.), would prohibit former DOD military and civilian employeeswho substantially participated in a contract procurement within the last twoyears of their DOD employment from accepting any compensation from thewinning contractor for two years after leaving DOD.andM;Take Another LookandM;While these proposals are less excessive and better balanced in therestrictions they place on the legislative, executive and judiciary branches,I also believe the sponsors should take a closer look at current ethics laws.andM;For example, the fiscal 1987 DOD budget authorization prevents certain seniorcivilian officials from discussing post-government employment with defensecontractors while still working at DOD.andP;  But it makes those officialseligible for severance pay based on their years of service while they lookfor a job after leaving the government.andM;Legislators should more closely examine such existing laws and, if necessary,expand legislation to include more or all government agencies andorganizations.andM;President Bush's Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform also has recommendedthat federal conflict of interest laws which now apply only to the executivebranch be extended to the judiciary and to congressional staff members, butnot to members of Congress.andM;According to commission members, the wide range of issues that come beforeCongress make it impossible to apply these rules to its members.andP;  Instead,the commission recommended that legislators be required to disclose publiclytheir financial holdings, so any potential conflict of interest would bepublic record.andM;Other commission suggestions include a two-year ban on the disclosure ofcertain &quot;non-public government&quot; information in connection with either adirect lobbying effort or with aiding and advising.andP;  The ban would includeprocurement-related proprietary or source selection information, and U.S.andO;international strategy.andM;Despite all the talk about lack of ethics, the procurement community shouldbe proud of its track record.andP;  While a small number of mishandled contractshave made the headlines, more than 15 million contractual actions are handledannually, and the vast majority of them are done properly.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
