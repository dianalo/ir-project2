Includedamong these were monitoring and enforcement procedures such as periodic(approximately once every two months) unannounced inspection visits byNew York State Department of Motor Vehicle (NYSDMV) personnel and unannounced,concealed identity, inspections designed to ensure that private inspectionstations properly performed their emissions inspections, adequately maintainedthe exhaust analyzers and kept satisfactory records. On January 1, 1981,the I/M program began with mandatory inspections and voluntary repair.On January 1, 1982, mandatory inspection and repair became effective.On February 15, 1984, EPA received a SIP revision request from New YorkState which proposed modifications to the I/M monitoring and enforcementprocedures used by the NYSDMV. Specifically, the revisions reduced theperiodic monitoring visits at stations from once every two months to onceevery four months, increased the concealed identity monitoring visits toensure that at least 25 percent of all inspection stations received anundercover investigation every year, increased the oversight of stationswith less than satisfactory performance and expanded the public's awarenessof the consumer complaint services offered by the NYSDMV. Other aspectsof the monitoring and enforcement procedures remained unchanged. EPA approvedthe request on June 1, 1984 (49 FR 22812).<ITAG tagnum="84">The State Submittal</ITAG>On September 19, 1988 the Director of the Division of Air Resources ofthe New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) submitteda SIP revision request proposing to alter the nature and frequency of I/Minspection station audits for a two year trial period. This revision wouldrequire NYSDMV personnel to perform two unannounced, expanded, audits ofeach inspection station per year, and to conduct 1,800 concealed identityinspections annually, with at least 25 percent of these concealed identityinspections performed with a vehicle that has been set to fail the emissionstest.It should be noted that while the frequency of inspection station auditsdecreases under this proposal, the State is proposing to perform more intensiveaudits that would focus on accounting for inspection records and stickersin far more detail than could normally be undertaken during a routine audit.In order to implement the proposed expanded audit program, NYSDMV has committedto increase staffing by about 40 percent over present levels. As a result,the State expects audit related enforcement actions to increase by about81 percent over present levels.The NYSDEC stated that a shift to concealed identity inspections wouldensure the most effective use of field staff for improving the I/M program.The State believes that concealed identity inspections tend to identifyserious violations, especially with respect to improper inspections, whileprogram audits rarely identify improper inspections but, rather, identifyrecord keeping problems. By increasing concealed identify inspections from1100 to 1800 annually, the State expects concealed identity related enforcementactions to increase by about 64 percent over present levels.The State expects that the combination of expanded audits and increasedconcealed identity inspections will increase overall enforcement actionsby 73 percent. However, the State has found that it cannot quantify theeffect of these modifications on air quality. Nonetheless, the State believesthat the increased effectiveness of enforcement associated with the modificationswill reduce the number of incomplete and improperly performed inspectionsand, therefore will lead to some improvements in air quality.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding</ITAG>EPA has reviewed the State's submittal and finds that the revised enforcementand monitoring procedures should improve the overall quality of the I/Mprogram and, thus, provide air quality benefits equivalent to those committedto in New York's SIP. This action does not preclude comprehensive programrestructuring that might be necessary as the State prepares for the submittalof its September 1991 SIP revision. Consequently, this SIP revision isbeing proposed for approval only with the understanding that the programis being executed on a two-year trial basis. At the end of this two-yearperiod, EPA will evaluate the results of the trial and decide whether themodifications should be a permanent component of the State's enforcementprocedures. Any future actions taken in this respect will be announcedin the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>EPA is soliciting public comments on its proposed action. Comments willbe considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participatein the federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to theaddress noted at the beginning of today's notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>EPA is today proposing to find that New York's revised I/M enforcementand monitoring procedures adequately fulfill the SIP commitment made bythe State.This notice is issued as required by section 110 of the Clean Air Act,as amended. The Administrator's decision regarding the approval of thisplan revision is based on its meeting the requirements of section 110 ofthe Clean Air Act, and 40 CFR part 51.Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Carbon monoxide, Hydrocarbons.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Editorial note: </T4>This document was received by the Office of theFederal Register on November 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
