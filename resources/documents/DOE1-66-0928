A specially constructed lapping machineusing an air bearing spindle was built to achieve the required edge quality.The basic design for this lap was taken out of a technical report byW.L. Duke and R.T. Lovell of Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant Union Carbide Corp.We have also purchased two commercially built lapping machines recommendedto us by Mr. Cory A. Knottenbelt, formerly of R.C.A. Diamond LappingFacility, in Indianapolis, Indiana, now doing state-of-the-art polishingand relapping at LLNL facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
