And it's turning heads at the Thrift Drug store inPittsburgh's posh Fox Chapel suburb. Once the hit among giddyteen-agers, the cosmetics line is now attracting more matureshoppers. &quot;Cover Girl is a reason people shop here,&quot; saysRalph Petri, a vice president of the drugstore chain.</LP><TEXT>   Cover Girl is growing up under the watchful eye of newparent Procter andamp; Gamble Co. Although Pandamp;G has owned the brandfor only 18 months, Cover Girl is already more upscale andaggressive. The Cincinnati consumer products concern hasinvested heavily to beef up advertising, packaging and newproduct launches, including a longer-lasting lipstick. Andresearchers are working on a new generation of skin-careproducts to appeal to aging baby boomers fretting aboutwrinkles.   With Cover Girl's makeover well under way, Pandamp;G is alsolooking around for other cosmetics makers to acquire. It isconsidered the frontrunner to buy some -- and possibly all --of Revlon Inc.'s line.   Pandamp;G's foray into cosmetics comes at a time of upheaval inthe industry, when stellar brand names are losing theircachet. Shoppers are increasingly abandoning hard-selldepartment stores for discount outlets and specialtyboutiques.   &quot;There's a lot of dissatisfaction among consumers&quot; andthey're switching where they shop, says Wendy Liebmann, whoheads WSL Marketing, a New York consulting firm specializingin cosmetics. &quot;People are tired of being spritzed andattacked when they come through the door at Bloomingdale's.&quot;   Indeed, a recent industry survey showed that departmentstore sales accounted for 31.7% of sales in 1989, down from33% in 1988. But mass merchandisers' share climbed to 14.1%from 13.4% in the same period.   And Cover Girl is enjoying its share of growth as shoppersmigrate. The brand now has 23% of the mass market, a steadyclimb up from 21% in 1986, according to estimates fromWertheim Schroder andamp; Co. Maybelline is second with 17%, downfrom 19% in 1986.   It's likely to keep growing because &quot;it delivers goodvalue in a more glamorous look than in years gone by,&quot; saysAllison Cohen, a senior vice president who does consumerresearch for Ally andamp; Gargano, a New York advertising agency.   At chains like Thrift Drug, Cover Girl now shares displayspace with pricey brands like Estee Lauder and ElizabethArden. Thrift has expanded its cosmetics aisles into trendyboutiques featuring pink walls and parquet wood floors. Acosmetician signs up customers for free makeovers usingdifferent product lines. But shoppers can also helpthemselves to blush and eyeliner, a freedom that doesn'texist in department stores. &quot;Instead of one or two items,they'll buy four or five,&quot; says Craig Sinclair, a Thrift vicepresident.   When Pandamp;G bought Cover Girl and its parent company NoxellCorp. in 1989 for $1.3 billion in stock, the brand wasfading. &quot;In order to grow the company, {Noxell} had to takemoney from ads for Noxema and Cover Girl. That weakened themarketing position,&quot; says F. Stone Roberts, chief operatingofficer of Lintas, the New York advertising agency thathandled Cover Girl until Pandamp;G's acquisition.   Still, Pandamp;G recognized Cover Girl's strong foundation:After working at it for years, the brand knocked Maybellinefrom first place in 1986. Pandamp;G also admired Noxell's researchroots. Founder George Avery Bunting, a Baltimore pharmacist,got his start in 1917 selling a coffee pot brew of clove andeucalyptus oils in little blue jars. After a customerdeclared the cream &quot;knocked my eczema,&quot; the sunburn remedywas named Noxzema.   In the early 1960s, Noxell launched Cover Girl as afoundation to conceal acne. &quot;To take the stigma off theproduct, it was positioned as makeup worn by famous models,&quot;recalls Mr. Roberts. While it became the best-selling massmarket brand, it never competed with upscale,department-store brands.   Pandamp;G didn't waste any time shaking up Cover Girl. Itspeeded and expanded a package redesign for all Cover Girlproducts that had been under way when it took over. CoverGirl eye shadows are now stamped with a textured imprint thatmakes them appear more upscale. And the old-fashioned beigepackaging has been replaced with bright white highlightedwith more contemporary typeface and graphics. The look isritzier, but the products are still budget priced.   Pandamp;G is also spending more to introduce products. Alipstick called Lip Advance that was rolled out last Januaryis a hit because the two-step powder and top coat stays onlonger and doesn't cake as much as traditional lipsticks.   Consumers are being bombarded with new Cover Girl ads. Forthe first nine months of 1990, Pandamp;G spent an estimated $47.5million on Cover Girl advertising, up 58% from a yearearlier, before its acquisition, according to figures fromLeading National Advertisers Inc.   A recent campaign called &quot;Redefining Beautiful&quot; featuresmodels with a more natural look and a variety of ages, haircolors and styles. For instance, the April issue of New Womanmagazine has a Cover Girl ad for Thick Lash mascara featuringa very young short-haired brunette named Roberta Chirko. Buta second ad acknowledges that cover girls age: FortysomethingJennifer O'Neill, an early model for the brand, now modelsReplenishing Make-Up, which promises &quot;you'll see less of tinylines.&quot;   There are hurdles ahead. For starters, the name Cover Girlhardly appeals to career women or even aging housewives.&quot;There's an inherent limitation in the name,&quot; says Mr.Roberts of Lintas. Moreover, competition is heating up. Whiledepartment stores are losing customers, cosmetics boutiqueslike the Body Shop, along with specialty clothing chains likeBenetton, are successfully wooing them with distinct brands.The Body Shop, which features all-natural skin-care andmakeup, has been highly successful in Britain and Europe andis now expanding rapidly into Canada and the U.S.   But Pandamp;G has the technological and marketing clout to fightback: By next year, Cover Girl could well be ready to launcha new line of skin-care products. And such products will havea speedier trip around the globe, especially in Europe, wherea Pandamp;G team is already plotting strategy.   Unilever Group is doing the same with its Calvin KleinCosmetics Co. The Anglo-Dutch company will soon introduceObsession fragrance products in Germany, Austria andSwitzerland. Unilever is also spending on Elizabeth Ardenproducts and other cosmetics acquired since 1989. The companyis now the No. 3 player in department store cosmetics, behindEstee Lauder Inc. and L'Oreal S.A.   Upscale Revlon, which includes Max Factor, Almay andUltima II, would give Pandamp;G the greater mass needed to buildglobal markets. Pandamp;G would probably concentrate on drugstoreand mass merchandise outlets, where it already controls shelfspace, rather than department stores. &quot;Procter would focus onits strengths and pound away,&quot; says Suzanne Grayson, anindustry consultant.</TEXT></DOC>
