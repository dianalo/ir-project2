Their laboratory has done some very limited workin this area which will be described. The authors began studying whateffect bacterial kidney disease (BKD) has on fish entering salt water.Preliminary tests were done with chinook salmon from three differentlocations in the Willamette River system. Fish which had attained a sufficientsize were released in the fall, and the remainder of the populationswere reared through the winter and released in the spring. In the falland again in the spring, 300 fish from each of the three sites were collected.A sample of 100 fish from each group was examined for the incidence ofBKD using a fluorescent antibody technique (FAT). The remaining 200 fishwere separated into two equal lots and placed in tanks supplied withUV-sterilized sea water. The fish which died in salt water and the survivorswere all examined for BKD using FAT.</TEXT></DOC>
