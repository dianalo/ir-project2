Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin called the Arrow projecta response to ``push-button'' warfare in which Arab foes wererelying on Soviet and Chinese rockets to try pierce Israelidefenses.   He said the missile should be ready for testing in two to threeyears, with a decision on production depending on the results.   The agreement was signed at a Pentagon ceremony by Maj. Gen.David Ivry, director general of the Israeli defense ministry, andLt. Gen. James Abrahamson, who is in charge of the U.S. StrategicDefense Initiative.   Israel is collaborating with the United States in the search fora space-based defense against Soviet ballistic missiles. Theprogram, known popularly as Star Wars, anticipates using kineticenergy, lasers and other sophisticated technology to destroy therockets before they could reach their U.S. targets.   Rabin stressed in a speech at the National Press Club thatIsrael's objectives were much more limited. He said if the Arrowproved effective in the tests the missile might be used as adefensive weapon at short-range.   The Israeli official said Israel had to find a way to cope withthe new missiles the Soviets had supplied to Syria and the Chineseto Saudi Arabia. He said the Syrian missiles could reach almostevery target in Israel.   For the Arabs, who have fought six major wars with Israel since1948, the rockets offer a chance to accomplish what Arab armies andair forces could not achieve, Rabin said.   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, at a separate newsconference, said the Arrow ``would make a contribution to our SDIprogram, and have application, as well, in other areas.''   He said the joint project ``fits in very well with our conceptof deterrence based on defense.''   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who appeared with Carlucciat the windup of separate talks with Australian officials, said``if you happen to be sitting in Israel, with shorter-rangeballistic missiles around you that are very hard to defend against,you feel very strongly the importance of learning how to defendyoursevles against them.''   A Pentagon statement said 80 percent of the cost would be borneby the United States and 20 percent by Israel.   The signing followed a statement of concern Tuesday by PresidentReagan after a meeting at the White House with Rabin. The presidentsaid he was troubled by ``ominous new military developments'' inthe area.   Rabin, during two days of talks here, has stressed Sovietdeliveries of new missiles to Syria and Libya, and Chineseshipments to Saudi Arabia.   ``If the United States could not persuade China and SaudiArabia, I doubt Israel would be able to persuade the SovietUnion,'' to refrain from the deliveries, Rabin said.   Israel has had a series of diplomatic meetings recently withSoviet officials that indicate a warming by Moscow to the Jewishstate, with which it broke relations in 1967.   On another subject, Rabin criticized American televisionnetworks and other media for giving much less coverage to missileattacks by Iran and Iraq on each other's cities and other waratrocitiies than to the beatings of Palestinian Arabs on the WestBank.   Rabin said he was used to having a ``double-standard'' appliedto Israel, but he believed the networks should have devoted morethan a few minutes to what he said was the slaying of 5,000 Kurdsby Iraq with chemical weapons.   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said Shultz had noplans to visit the Middle East in July. The possibility of such atrip was raised when Michael H. Armacost, undersecretary of statefor political affairs, told reporters in Israel he discussed theissue with Israeli leaders.</TEXT></DOC>
