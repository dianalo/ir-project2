Today, she is the only woman on Death Row _ alone, confused andill. Her prison cell in Pretoria is the farthest she's ever beenfrom home.   ``She cannot eat, she can't sleep,'' said her lawyer, AndreaDurbach of Cape Town. ``It's a very dramatic thing to say, but Iused to think to myself that she's just going to die of a brokenheart.''   Mrs. de Bruin and 13 men were sentenced to death in May for themob killing in November 1985 of a black policeman, Lucas Sethwala,in Paballelo, the black section of the remote northwestern town ofUpington.   Twenty-six people were tried for the killing, and four men werefound to have physically contributed to the death of Sethwala, whowas chased from his home, stoned, beaten and set afire.   In addition to those four, Mrs. de Bruin and nine others wereconvicted of murder under the doctrine of ``common purpose,'' whichholds them responsible because they were part of the crowd thatsought to kill Sethwala.   Sethwala's death occurred at a time of nationwide black unrest.Hours before he was slain several thousand blacks gathered at asoccer field in Paballelo to protest rent increases and othergrievances.   After police dispersed the crowd with tear gas, about 300 peoplere-grouped around Sethwala's home and threw stones to force himoutside.   Militant blacks have frequently attacked black policemen,accusing them of collaborating with the government and itsapartheid policies.   Mrs. de Bruin and her common-law husband, who also has beensentenced to death, were identified as having thrown stones atSethwala's house. According to the state's evidence, she allegedlyyelled: ``The dog is in the house. Bring him out and burn himalive.''   Mrs. de Bruin testified during the trial that she and herhusband went back to their own house after the protest meeting wasbroken up and were not present at Sethwala's home.   Mrs. de Bruin, who had no previous criminal record and workedfor the same white family for 30 years, has little understanding ofwhat is happening to her, Ms. Durbach said.   Mrs. de Bruin suffers from arthritis, heart disease and has highblood pressure, the lawyer said. She does not know in what city herprison is and thinks she's been imprisoned for at least a year,when in fact it has been six months.   She sees her husband for 30 minutes, once a month. They areseparated by a window and communicate through microphones. Onlythree of her 10 children have been able to visit her, Ms. Durbachsaid.   Because she cannot read and is too ill to exercise, Mrs. deBruin does little but listen to government-run radio that is pipedinto her cell, said Ms. Durbach, who visits her every three weeks.   She has been treated well by the prison staff and has developeda good relationship with one of the guards, Ms. Durbach added.   A judge ruled in September that the 14 people sentenced to deathcould appeal their sentences, but a bail request for Mrs. de Bruinwas turned down.   Two psychologists testified at her bail application that she hadsuffered mental and physical deterioration, including memory loss,since her imprisonment.   Ms. Durbach said no date has been set for the appeal, but shehopes it could be early next year.   In a similar mob killing, the Appeal Court, the country'shighest court, last year upheld under the ``common purpose''doctrine the death sentence of six blacks known as the``Sharpeville Six.''   However, after a storm of domestic and international protest,then-President P.W. Botha commuted their death sentences to lengthyprison terms.   The last woman to be executed in South Africa was Sandra Smith,25, who was of mixed race. She was hanged in June after beingconvicted of joining her boyfriend in the brutal knife murder of ateen-ager.   More than 50 people, mostly black, have been executed so farthis year, and more than 100 were hanged in each of the previousthree years.   Botha and his successor, F.W. de Klerk, have commuted 54 deathsentences this year.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tuesday AMs, Nov. 21</NOTE></DOC>
