His many admirers among the diplomatic set and much of the Washington establishment say his opposition to the Iranian arms sales has been vindicated. State Department officials insist he'll stay in office through 1988, strengthened by President Reagan's promises of an increased policy-making role and assurances that the National Security Council will be reined in.    Nevertheless, more-detached observers say Mr. Shultz's increased power will be damaged by lost credibility and eroded trust within the White House, on Capitol Hill and even among U.S. allies. Some in Washington say his handling of the situation has been self-serving at the expense of his president, and European allies are angered that he so sharply criticized their terrorism policies -- a disingenuous action when he knew the U.S. was privately wooing Iran.    &quot;He has been weakened with the White House and among allies,&quot; says Robert Hormats, a former senior State Department official now at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;I don't think the allies are going to accept the excuse that he wasn't fully briefed. They'll say, 'Mr. Secretary, you are the guy we deal with. Why didn't you insist on being told?'&quot;    Moreover, even if he is able to exercise more power during the Reagan administration's final two years, his critics charge that he is unlikely to achieve any lasting foreign-policy gains. They say that his lack of strategic vision has forced him to be a repairman of administration mistakes rather than an architect of foreign-policy initiatives that would outlive the Reagan era.    Mr. Shultz's friends, however, say he has shrewdly negotiated the current crisis. His clear effort to avoid getting involved in the Iran sales has left him &quot;the least damaged and most able to repair the situation,&quot; says former Undersecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.    But many moderate Republicans believe he went further than necessary at the start of the scandal in playing down his knowledge of the arms sales and then stage-managed an open hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to underscore his innocence. He said there that he knew &quot;zero&quot; about the transfer of Iran arms-sales funds to the Nicaraguan Contras and disclosed that one of his ambassadors bypassed him in helping the scheme -- a bit of news guaranteed to get the day's headlines.    When asked about Mr. Shultz, Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole snaps: &quot;In the beginning, when some of us wanted to support the president, it wasn't easy when he and others started to defect. . . . At first, he (Shultz) said he didn't know anything but then it became clear that he did.&quot;    In a similar vein, former National Security Council staff member William Quandt questions Mr. Shultz's clear avoidance of trying to learn about the execution of a policy he opposed. &quot;As long as you are going to be Secretary of State you can't selectively choose when you will participate in the conduct of foreign policy,&quot; says Mr. Quandt, now at the Brookings Institution. &quot;Where major policy decisions go against you, you have two choices. One is to resign and the other is to stay engaged.&quot;    Mr. Shultz's actions have angered some White House insiders, and some of Mr. Reagan's conservative allies fume that the president should fire his secretary of state instead of elevating him. They have long resented Mr. Shultz's influence, and they believe Mr. Reagan should have used the opportunity to remove him and replace him with a more like-minded, conservative secretary.    &quot;Secretary Shultz slapped the president across the face with both gloves,&quot; says Howard Phillips, president of the Conservative Caucus. He accuses the president of keeping around one of the &quot;icons of the Washington establishment&quot; as a way of appeasing &quot;the crocodiles&quot; who are out to devour him.    The secretary's carefully nurtured influence on Capitol Hill also will erode to some degree when Sen. Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.) takes over from Mr. Shultz's friend, Indiana Republican Richard Lugar, as Foreign Relations Committee chairman in 1987. Even Sen. Lugar, however, is privately critical of Mr. Shultz for washing his hands of policies regarding South Africa, Nicaragua and Iran instead of staying more actively in the fray.    There is growing criticism abroad, as well. European officials, who praise Mr. Shultz publicly, increasingly doubt he is an effective policy architect or spokesman for the Reagan administration. They say privately a more skeptical Europe will increasingly resist America's lead on issues such as terrorism and arms control.    &quot;Shultz is reasonably popular because he doesn't make too many waves, he takes the trouble to listen, he lowers the temperature and he's a solid sort of person,&quot; says David Watt, former director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. &quot;On the other hand, I think there is a general feeling that he is not wildly effective. The general state of chaos and confusion in Washington, which has been apparent to Europeans long before this Iran mess, can't be separated from Shultz altogether. If he were more of an operator than he is, maybe the influence of the State Department would be higher.&quot;    Mr. Shultz's many friends say the presence of his steady hand is crucial now, but they concede he accomplished little in the way of foreign-policy initiatives before the Iran scandal and is unlikely to do so afterward in the areas he has cared about most -- terrorism, the Middle East or arms control.    Allies will be even less likely than before to cooperate with U.S. efforts to punish state sponsors of terrorism. &quot;Supposing you wanted to use the F-111 bases again and have another go at Gadhafi,&quot; says Mr. Watt. &quot;I think it would be extremely difficult for Mrs. Thatcher to say yes again.&quot; Mr. Shultz has all but given up on starting a Middle East peace process and is instead concentrating on less ambitious, although important, policies such as restructuring Egyptian military debt.    Arms control is perhaps the last remaining area where progress is possible, but first Mr. Shultz must settle administration feuds over the future of the Strategic Defense Initiative and sell the president on a plan that would save his space-defense vision yet allow an arms agreement with Moscow.    &quot;The real problem is he has not gotten control over the arms-control portfolio,&quot; says Paul Warnke, a Carter administration arms-control expert.    Whatever Mr. Shultz can achieve in the future, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) says, &quot;his credibility with our allies is very important to us now to assure them we are going to be on track.&quot;    Rep. Dante Fascell (D., Fla.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, says Mr. Shultz can only rebuild his domestic and international influence when President Reagan makes it more clear publicly that the secretary of state is his unrivaled foreign-policy spokesman despite their past differences.    &quot;As he climbs out of his marshy bog, the president has got to reinculcate the authority Shultz needs,&quot; says Rep. Fascell. For the good of the country, he says, the president must either do that soon or cut Mr. Shultz loose. </TEXT></DOC>
