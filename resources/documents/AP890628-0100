Bush on Tuesday joined a chorus of lawmakers in calling for suchan amendment to nullify last week's Supreme Court ruling overturningstate flag-desecration laws.   However, House Speaker Thomas Foley said the House will not rushto nullify the Supreme Court decision. He contends the issue shouldnot be used for ``crass political purposes.''   Moving to slow down a possible stampede for constitutionalchange, Foley announced Tuesday that hearings will be held in Julyon setting aside the court ruling that threw out flag desecrationlaws in 48 states.   Fitzwater said Bush had consulted with attorneys on details ofhis proposed amendment, and that a number of proposals already hadbeen advanced on Capitol Hill. ``It's not like there's a clear platehere,'' he said. ``There's been a lot of drafting done on the Hill.''   Fitzwater did not divulge specific details of Bush's proposal.   The president has proclaimed that a constitutional amendment _ aprocess used only 26 times in the nation's history _ is the onlysolution to change the 5-4 ruling.   Foley, D-Wash., said the House Judiciary Committee hearings ``arenot going to be rushed but they will not be obstructive.'' They will``be conducted calmly in the spirit of deliberation and care ... weare not seeking to inflame this issue,'' he told reporters.   Foley called a constitutional change ``a very deeply felt matterand ... also one which touches upon the First Amendment to theUnited States Constitution, which is the source of the most sacredpersonal values of this country: freedom of speech, freedom ofreligious worship and freedom of the press.''   A proposed 27th Amendment might attempt to carve out a specificand narrow exception to the First Amendment's free-speech protectionfor flag burning. But free-speech advocates said any such effortendangers all freedom of expression.   ``The minute you establish the principle that there can beexceptions to the First Amendment for offensive speech, there's noprincipled way to limit it,'' Ira Glasser, executive director of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union, said today.   ``The first exception will not be the last,'' Glasser added.``Someone adds an exception for derogatory racial remarks. If you'rea woman you want an exception for Playboy. If you're a Jew you wantan exception for Nazis marching. Pretty soon, you don't have a FirstAmendment.''   With senators already home for their July 4 break, Foley gaveHouse members outraged by last week's ruling a chance to vent theirfeelings. He scheduled an immediate vote on a non-binding resolutionexpressing ``profound concern'' over the decision, and the Housepassed it, 411-5.   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.,said Tuesday he favors seeking to nullify the ruling by passinglegislation to prohibit burning the flag. A law can be ruledunconstitutional by the Supreme Court.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, interviewed today on ``CBS ThisMorning,'' noted that the courts still would have a role ininterpreting the amendment.   ``If the constitutional amendment is passed, it will obviouslyrequire some implementing legislation at both the federal and statelevel if the Congress and state legislators want to follow throughon it effectively, and the terms of that legislation would then besubject to construction in the courts,'' he said.   Foley told reporters he will vigorously fight any attempt byconservative Republicans to use the flag issue against Democrats.President Bush scored points against Democratic presidentialcandidate Michael Dukakis last year by criticizing the Massachusettsgovernor's veto of legislation that would have required the state'spublic school teachers to lead daily pledges of allegiance to theflag.   ``I am sure there will be people trying to play politics withit,'' Foley said. ``Anybody who suggests that there is a partydifference in respect for the American flag is using this deepaffection of Americans, twisting it, manipulating it, using it forthe most base and crass political purposes. It would bereprehensible and disgusting. I am condemning those who are doingit.''   But Bush said earlier Tuesday at a news conference, ``I thinkrespect for the flag transcends political party and I think whatI've said here is American. It isn't Republican or Democrat, itisn't liberal or conservative.''   Debate on the resolution, sponsored by House Judiciary CommitteeChairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, was often emotional despite thenon-binding nature of the language.   Rep. Carroll Hubbard Jr., D-Ky., asked those who burn the flag to``consider moving to Iran, China or Cuba, where burning the flag ...is encouraged.''   But Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., said the court acted correctly topreserve freedom of speech, adding, ``I exult in the decision ...because the Supreme Court has validated once again the Constitutionand the Bill of Rights.''   Saying he personally deplored desecration of the flag, Weisscautioned members against ``reckless tampering with theConstitution.''   Voting along with Weiss against the resolution were Reps. GusSavage, D-Ill.; Ronald Dellums, D-Calif.; William Clay, D-Mo., andGeorge W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich.   The House hearings could be held by the full Judiciary Committee,but Brooks could assign them to the civil rights subcommittee headedby Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., a strong supporter of the courtdecision.   Edwards pledged Tuesday he will ``not try by any trick to bury''a proposed constitutional amendment, but added that he hopes peoplewill ``think about the risk they are taking for freedom of speech.''   Bush, declaring the American flag a ``unique national symbol,''said Tuesday, ``As president, I will uphold our precious right todissent, but burning the flag goes too far, and I want to see thatmatter remedied.''   A constitutional amendment is ratified after a two-thirds vote byboth houses of Congress and approval by legislatures of 38 states.</TEXT></DOC>
