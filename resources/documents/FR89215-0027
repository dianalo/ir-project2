The Office will be extending the commentperiod on the proposed amendments of the rules of practice in patent cases,which would clarify requirements in the filing of applications and providefor procedures for applicants to cure certain defects in the filing ofapplications. After comments are received, the PTO will issue a noticeof final rulemaking addressing these proposals.Establishment and adjustment of patent fees is provided for by section6 and section 41 of Title 35, United States Code, and section 103(b) ofPub. L. 100-703. Establishment and adjustment of trademark fees is providedfor by section 31 of the Trademark (Lanham) Act of 1946, as amended (15U.S.C. 1113) and section 103(a) of Pub. L. 100-703.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>April 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Frances Michalkewicz by telephoneat (703) 557-1610 or by mail marked to her attention and addressed to theCommissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Washington, DC 20231.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Patent fees were set on October 1,1982, in accordance with the provisions of Title 35, United States Code(Pub. L. 97-247). Patent fees were adjusted effective October 5, 1985,in accordance with the provisions of Title 35, United States Code. Trademarkfees were set on October 1, 1982, in accordance with the provisions ofsection 31 of the Trademark (Lanham) Act of 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C.1113) and adjusted on October 1, 1986, in accordance with the provisionsof that Act and Title 35. On November 6, 1986, legislation modifying theway fee adjustments could be made was enacted as Pub. L. 99-607. The feeadjustment provisions of Pub. L. 99-607, section 3(a) and section 3(b)expired on September 30, 1988. On November 19, 1988, legislation extendingsection 3(a) and section 3(b) of Pub. L. 99-607 was enacted as Pub. L.100-703. Therefore, patent and trademark fee adjustments were guided bythe provisions of Title 35, United States Code, and the Trademark (Lanham)Act of 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1113), and by Pub. L. 100-703.The Patent and Trademark Office is amending 37 CFR 2.6 to reduce the feefor filing an application for trademark registration from $200 to $175per class. The Office also is reducing the fee for recording trademarkassignments and agreements or other papers relating to the property ina registration or application from $100 to $8 for each mark in the samedocument.Effective October 1, 1982, trademark operations within the Office became100 percent user-fee funded. Experience to date has demonstrated that thefees first established in October 1982, and as later adjusted in October1986, are more than adequate to meet total trademark function costs. Atthe end of fiscal year 1988, total trademark function fees exceeded totaltrademark function costs by approximately $10 million. Left undisturbed,it is projected that the current trademark fee structure will result inan additional $12.7 million in excess fees over the course of the nextthree-year fee cycle. Thus, by the end of fiscal year 1991, total trademarkfees are projected to exceed total trademark costs by almost $23 millionif the current fee structure remains in place.In this light, the Office is reducing both the trademark application andassignment fees. Reducing the application fee to $175 would be consistentwith the legislative history surrounding passage of Pub. L. 97-247. Inits report (H. Rep. No. 97-542, May 17, 1982), the House Committee on theJudiciary stated that, ``It is expected that the Commissioner will setthe [trademark] fees in a way that the filing fee will be kept as low aspossible to foster use of the Federal registration system.'' The applicationfiling fee from October 1982 to October 1986 was $175. The filing fee wasincreased in 1986 to $200 in an effort to recover a greater percentageof the actual costs incurred in the processing of trademark applications.While the reduction will increase the discrepancy between the applicationfiling fee and our projected unit cost, the size of the current ``surplus,''as well as the objective of encouraging filings, supports the action.Reducing the fee for recording trademark assignments to $8 for each markmakes such fees consistent with those for the recording of patent assignments.While the fee reductions still will leave a healthy ``surplus,'' prudencesuggests that further reductions be held in abeyance pending implementationof ``The Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988'' (Pub. L. 100-667). The Act,among other things, permits applicants to file applications for Federaltrademark registrations based upon a bona fide ``intent-to-use'' the markin commerce. Implementation of ``intent-to-use'' legislation will requirethe Office to incur additional expenditures, such as increased personnelcosts and improved computer capabilities. The Office will review its trademarkfee structure approximately 18 months from implementation and propose furtherfee adjustments if warranted, but will not propose to adjust the applicationand assignment fees.Even absent ``intent-to-use,'' the Office will probably be required toupgrade its computer capabilities within the near future. Moreover, implementationof an automated trademark assignment system, now scheduled for fiscal year1990, and other improvements in automated searching, will result in increaseddemands on trademark resources.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Provisions of Title 35 and Title 15, United States Code, and Pub. L. 100-703Which Affect This Notice of Final RulemakingPatent and Trademark Office fees are authorized by 35 U.S.C. 41 and 35U.S.C. 376. Section 41(a) of Title 35, United States Code, establishesa number of statutory fees. Among the more significant of these are feesfor filing a patent application and issuing a patent. Certain other fees,such as appeal fees, the fee for filing a disclaimer, fees for filing petitionsseeking to revive an abandoned application and for extensions of time alsoare set in 35 U.S.C. 41(a). Section 41(b) of Title 35, United States Code,sets forth the statutory fees for maintaining a patent in force if theapplication was filed on or after August 27, 1982.The provisions of Pub. L. 96-517 also establish maintenance fees for patentsother than design and plant patents issued on applications filed on orafter December 12, 1980 and before August 27, 1982. These maintenance feesare to recover 25 percent of the estimated cost to the Office of processingpatent applications.Section 1 of Pub. L. 97-247 authorized the reduction by 50 percent in thefees paid under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and 35 U.S.C. 41(b) by independent inventors,small business concerns, and nonprofit organizations, who meet the definitionsestablished. Section 1(a)(2) of Pub. L. 99-607 makes this provision permanentin 35 U.S.C. 41(h).Section 41(f) of Title 35, United States Code, provides that fees establishedin 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and 35 U.S.C. 41(b), ``may be adjusted by the Commissioneron October 1, 1985, and every third year thereafter, to reflect any fluctuationsoccurring during the previous three years in the Consumer Price Index,as determined by the Secretary of Labor.'' Section 41(f) also providesthat changes of less than one percent may be ignored. Public Law 100-703makes no modifications to 35 U.S.C. 41(f).Sction 41(d) of Title 35, United States Code, provides that the ``Commissionerwill establish fees for all other processing, services, or materials relatedto patents'' which are not covered in 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and 35 U.S.C. 41(b),``to recover the estimated average cost to the Office of such processing,services or materials.''Section 103(b) of Pub. L. 100-703 changes the way fees established under35 U.S.C. 41(d) can be adjusted. For fiscal years 1989, 1990, and 1991,the Commissioner cannot increase fees established under 35 U.S.C. 41(d)except for the purposes of making adjustments which in the aggregate donot exceed fluctuations during the previous three years in the ConsumerPrice Index.Section 103(b) of Pub. L. 100-703 provides that the Commissioner cannotestablish additional fees under 35 U.S.C. 41(d) during fiscal years 1989,1990, and 1991.Section 376 of Title 35, United States Code, authorizes the Commissionerto set fees for patent applications filed under the Patent CooperationTreaty. The fees under the Patent Cooperation Treaty are keyed to fullcost recovery of the processing costs under the Treaty. Public Law 100-703makes no modifications to 35 U.S.C. 376.Section 31 of the Trademark (Lanham) Act of 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C.1113) authorizes the Commissioner to establish fees for the filing andprocessing of an application for the registration of a trademark or othermark, and for all other services and materials relating to trademarks andother marks. No fee for the filing or processing of an application forthe registration of a trademark or other mark or for the renewal or assignmentof a trademark or other mark will be adjusted more than once every threeyears. The House Committee on the Judiciary, in a report that accompaniedH.R. 6260, which ultimately was enacted as Pub. L. 97-247, recommendeda trademark fee schedule to the Commissioner which was established by arule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 30, 1982, at 47 FR 33086, effective October1, 1982. A final rule to increase the trademark application filing feeper class and the fee for copies of trademarks was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 4, 1986, at 51 FR 28052. The increasedfees became effective on October 1, 1986.Section 103(a) of Pub. L. 100-703 changes the way fees established underthe Trademark (Lanham) Act of 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1113) can beadjusted. For fiscal years 1989, 1990, and 1991, the Commissioner cannotincrease fees established under the Act except for the purposes of makingadjustments which in the aggregate do not exceed fluctuations during theprevious three years in the Consumer Price Index.Section 103(a) of Pub. L. 100-703 provides that the Commissioner cannotestablish additional fees under the Trademark (Lanham) Act of 1946, asamended (15 U.S.C. 1113) during fiscal years 1989, 1990, and 1991.However, as described above, the Office is only reducing the fee for filingan application, per class, and the fee for recording trademark assignmentsand agreements or other papers relating to the property in a registrationor application.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule Changes</ITAG>General Procedures<ITAG tagnum="81">Cost Calculations</ITAG>The Office calculated unit costs for all fees based on OMB Circular A-25,``User Fees,'' and OMB Circular A-130, ``Management of Federal InformationResources.'' Costs were determined from the best available records (forexample, the 1987 end of fiscal year financial statements for the Office)and included direct and indirect costs to the Office of carrying out theactivity, as directed by OMB Circular A-25. To estimate costs for the three-yearfee cycle, April 1989-March 1992, the 1987 actual costs were adjusted bythe inflation rates from October 1988 through March 1989, and then by amid-cycle inflation rate for the period April 1989-March 1992. The totalinflation rate was 12.644 percent derived from the Administration's inflationprojection.Workload ProjectionsDetermination of future year workloads varies by fee code. Principal workloadprojection techniques are as follows:Patent and trademark application workloads were projected from statisticalregression models using recent application trends. Associated applicationworkloads, for example, patent claims and extensions of time, grow relativeto patent applications. Patent issues are projected from an in-house patentproductivity model and reflect examiner production achievements and goals.Patent maintenance fee workloads utilize patents issued 3.5, 7.5 and 11.5years prior to payment and assume payment rates of 80 percent, 50 percentand 25 percent, respectively. Trademark affidavits and renewals are basedon prior year registrations and renewal trends. Service fee workloads followlinear trends from prior year activities. All workload estimates are approvedby the manager responsible for the fee program.<ITAG tagnum="81">Policy for Applying the Consumer Price Index</ITAG>The Office of Management and Budget has determined that the Patent andTrademark Office should use Consumer Price Index-U (CPI) to adjust patentfees. The Department of Labor's Consumer Price Index is made public approximatelytwenty-one days after the end of the month being calculated. The time lagbetween the initiation and the completion of the rulemaking process dictatesthat the December 1988 through March 1989 inflation rate be projected.The Administration's projected cumulative CPI for the three-year period,April 1986-March 1989, is 10.311 percent.The fee amounts being adopted by this rule package were adjusted by theCPI that was projected in 1988, i.e., 10.303 percent. Since this is lessthan the amount the Office has determined to be the actual projected rateand that applying the updated projection of 10.311 percent would have anegligible effect on the fee amounts, no changes have been made.<ITAG tagnum="81">Rounding Procedures</ITAG>After application of the 10.303 percent projected fluctuation in the CPIto fees, amounts were rounded by applying standard arithmetical rules sothat the amounts rounded would be de minimis and convenient to the user.Fees of $100 or more were rounded to the nearest $10. Fees between $10and $99 were rounded to the nearest even number so that the comparablesmall entity fee would be a whole number. Fees under $2 were rounded forconvenience.Since the amounts of the patent fees that went into effect on October 5,1985 were rounded after application of the Consumer Price Index, a firststep in calculating new fee amounts was to eliminate any effects of roundingprior years' fee adjustments. For example, 35 U.S.C. 41(a), sets the patentapplication filing fee at $300.00. Applying the 11.8 percent CPI for theperiod 1983-1985 resulted in an allowable increase to $335.40. This amountwas rounded to $340.00. For purposes of this fee adjustment process, thebase used to adjust fees for the next fee cycle was the ``unrounded'' feeamount, i.e., the $335.40 for patent application filing fees. Similarly,the cost for certifying Office records was $2.70. This amount was roundedto $3.00. For purposes of this fee adjustment process, the base was theunrounded amount of $2.70.It should be noted that following routine rounding off practices can resultin some fee items being adjusted by more or less than CPI. This divergencefrom the CPI ceiling will only exist in the short term because of the policyof applying the CPI adjustment factor to the unrounded amount from theprevious fee cycle.Rule Changes Under Title 35 and Title 15, United States Code and Pub. L.100-703Statutory patent fees established under 35 U.S.C. 41(a) and 35 U.S.C. 41(b)are adjusted in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 41(f) to reflect any fluctuationsoccurring during the previous three years in the CPI.Non-statutory patent fees established under 35 U.S.C. 41(d) are adjustedin accordance with section 103(b) of Pub. L. 100-703 to reflect, in theaggregate, any fluctuations occurring during the previous three years (April1986-March 1989) in the Consumer Price Index, as determined by the Secretaryof Labor.Fees established under 35 U.S.C. 376 are adjusted to recover the full costof processing under the Patent Cooperation Treaty. International patentfees under 37 CFR 1.492 are related to patent fees established under 35U.S.C. 41(a) and are adjusted to reflect fluctuations in the CPI. For fees established under section 31 of the Trademark (Lanham) Act of1946, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1113), the Office is reducing the fee for filingan application, per class, and the fee for recording trademark assignmentsand agreements or other papers relating to the property in a registrationor application as fully decribed above. Fee Adjustment Methodology <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Projected Actual Costs </ITAG>The projected actual costs for all fee items were calculated by applyingthe principles of OMB Circulars A-25 and A-130. a. Statutory patent fees were derived by: (1) Identifying those operationalunits of the Office involved in, or contributing to, the processing ofa patent application through all phases of examination; (2) identifyingand certifying actual fiscal year 1987 obligations incurred by the operationalunits in processing an application; (3) projecting those obligations tothe period of April 1989 through March 1992 in accordance with approvedbudgets and future year budget targets; and (4) increasing the obligationsprojected for the period of April 1989 through March 1992 by the Administration'sestimates for Federal pay raise adjustments and projected inflation. Projectedactual costs for April 1989-March 1992, $729,810,051 less projected budgetauthority of $265,834,000, are $463,976,051. b. For non-statutory patent fees, projected costs for each fee item wereestablished by (1) identifying actual costs for 1987; and (2) projectingactual costs for fiscal years 1988 through March 1992 by applying the Administration'sinflation projection of 12.644 percent. This projected actual cost was then multiplied by the projected workloadfor each fee item. The sum of the projected costs for all fee items isthe projected actual cost of operation during the three-year fee cycle.Projected actual costs for April 1989-March 1992 are $64,661,341. c. The same methodologies as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) abovewere applied to Patent Cooperation Treaty fees. Projected actual costsfor April 1989-March 1992 are $16,531,990. d. The same methodology as described in paragraph (b) above was appliedto Trademark fees. Projected actual costs for April 1989-March 1992 arecalculated to be $74,329,783. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Income Projections </ITAG>a. The maximum amount of statutory fee income that the Office is authorizedto recover under 35 U.S.C. 41(f) was calculated as follows:For each statutory patent fee, the unrounded base (i.e., the 1986 adjustedfee before rounding) was multiplied by the projected CPI fluctuation of10.303 percent for the three-year period April 1986-March 1989. This amountwas then multiplied by the projected workload for April 1989-March 1992to project the income from that fee item during the April 1989-March 1992fee cycle. The sum of the projected incomes from all statutory patent feesis the maximum amount that the Office is authorized by 35 U.S.C. 41(f)to recover during the fee cycle and is equal to $464,676,178. b. The maximum amount of non-statutory fee income that the Office is authorizedto recover under section 103(b) of Pub. L. 100-703 was calculated as follows:For each non-statutory patent fee, the unrounded base (i.e., the 1986 adjustedfee before rounding) was multiplied by the projected CPI fluctuation of10.303 percent for the three-year period April 1986-March 1989. This amountwas then multiplied by the projected workload for April 1989-March 1992to project the income from that fee item during April 1989-March 1992 feecycle. The sum of the projected incomes from all non-statutory patent feesis the maximum amount that the Office is authorized by section 103(b) ofPub. L. 100-703 to recover during the fee cycle and is equal to $62,101,874.c. For Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) fees, the Office is authorized by35 U.S.C. 376 to recover the full cost of processing under the Treaty.Thus, the projected costs identified in paragraph 1(c) for Patent CooperationTreaty fees of $16,531,990 would be the maximum level of recovery.d. The maximum amount of trademark fee income that the Office is authorizedto recover under section 103(a) of Pub. L. 100-703 was calculated as follows.For each trademark fee, the unrounded base (i.e., the 1986 adjusted feebefore rounding) was multiplied by the projected CPI fluctuation of 10.303percent for the three-year period April 1986-March 1989. This amount wasthen multiplied by the projected workload for April 1989-March 1992 toproject the income from that fee item during the April 1989-March 1992fee cycle. The sum of the projected incomes from all trademark fees isthe maximum amount that the Office is authorized by section 103(a) of Pub.L. 100-703 to recover during the fee cycle and is equal to $107,704,135.e. Each statutory patent fee amount identified in paragraph 2(a), and eachPCT amount identified in paragraph 2(c) above was rounded according tothe de minimis rounding rules described above. Sections 103(a) and 103(b) of Pub. L. 100-703 allow the Office to set fees``in the aggregate.'' The fee amounts for non-statutory patent fees andtrademark fees will recover the maximum amount of income determined inparagraphs (b) and (d) above. Each of these fee amounts was multiplied by the projected workload duringthe fee cycle to project the income from that fee item. The sum of theprojected income from all patent fees is $542,281,082, which is the sumof the projected incomes from statutory patent fees, $463,626,421, non-statutorypatent fees, $62,047,763, and Patent Cooperation Treaty fees, $16,606,898.f. The Office reduced two trademark fees, as described above. Each trademarkfee amount was mulitplied by the projected workload during the fee cycleto project the income from that fee item. The sum of the projected incomefrom all trademark fees is projected to be $72,972,690.

The Office hasdetailed cost calculation worksheets for each fee item, which are availablefor public inspection in Suite 904 of Building 2, Crystal Park at 2121Crystal Drive, Arlington, Virginia. It is intended that the amount of any fee due and payable on or after April17, 1989, is the amount set in this rulemaking. For purposes of determiningthe amount of the fee to be paid, the date of mailing indicated on a properCertificate of Mailing, where authorized under 37 CFR 1.8, will be consideredto be the date of receipt in the Office. A ``Certificate of Mailing underSection 1.8'' is not ``proper'' for items which are specifically excludedfrom the provisions of andSection; 1.8. Section 1.8 should be consulted forthose items for which a Certificate of Mailing is not ``proper.'' Suchitems include, inter alia, the filing of national and international applicationsfor patents and the filing of trademark applications. The provisions of37 CFR 1.10, relating to filing of papers and fees by ``Express Mail''with certificate, however, do apply to any paper or fee (including patentand trademark applications) to be filed in the Office. If an applicationor fee is filed by ``Express Mail'' with a certificate of express mailingdated on and after the effective date of the rules, the amount of the feeto be paid is the fee established herein if a change is being made in thefee. In order to ensure clarity in the implementation of the fee proposals,a discussion of specific sections is set forth below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Specific Rules</ITAG>Section 1.12 Assignment records open to public inspection.Section 1.12, paragraph (a) is amended to refer to the renumbered andSection;1.19(b)(4).

Each photocopier and reader/printer is connected to an accessdevice which affords access to the equipment through the use of a magneticcard which has been encoded with an amount pre-paid by the customer. Theaccess devices, encoding equipment, and magnetic cards comprise an equipmentaccess system called the CopiShare system. The magnetic CopiShare Cardsare purchased by the public and encoded with an amount of funds paid tothe Office. The customer places the encoded card in the device connectedto the photocopier or reader/printer, and a pre-set amount is deductedfor each copy produced.The Office is planning to authorize the public to use credit cards forthe purchase of CopiShare Cards. This will be a pilot program for acceptingcredit cards for fees, and if feasible, may be extended to other operationsof the Office.Section 1.21(h) is further amended to establish one fee for recording eachproperty in an assignment, agreement or other paper relating to the propertyin a patent or application. The fee reflects increased costs to enhancethe processing of assignments.Section 1.26 Refunds.Section 1.26 is amended to change paragraph (c) to provide for a refundof $1,500 if the Commissioner decides not to institute reexamination proceedings.The $1,500 refund would apply to those instances where the proposed reexaminationfee of $1,980 under 37 CFR 1.20(c) was paid. The current $1,300 refundwill be made in those cases where the current $1,770 reexamination feewas paid.Section 1.55 Claim for foreign priority.Section 1.55, paragraph (a) is amended to refer to the renumbered andSection;1.17(i)(1).Section 1.102 Advancement of examination.Section 1.102, paragraph (d) is amended to refer to the petition fee setforth in new paragraph 1.17(i)(2).

Correctionsof typographical errors were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 8, 1988, at 53 FR 49637. A noticealso was published on December 13, 1988 at volume 1097 of the <T3>Official Gazette</T3> of the United States Patent and Trademark Office,pages 16 through 29. A public hearing was conducted on January 4, 1989.Six letters submitting written comments were received and oral testimonywas presented by one person at the public hearing. All of the written andoral comments were considered in adopting the changes set forth herein.The comments submitted, along with responses, appear below.<T3>Comment: </T3>A major patent law association requested an additionalsixty (60) days to comment on proposed changes to the following rules thatgo beyond fees. Several other respondents also commented on the proposedchanges to these rules.37 CFR 1.53 Serial number, filing date, and completion of application.37 CFR 1.55 Claim for foreign priority.37 CFR 1.60 Continuation or divisional application for invention disclosedin a prior application.37 CFR 1.62 File wrapper continuing procedure.37 CFR 1.96 Submission of computer program listings.<T3>Response: </T3>The Office is not amending 37 CFR 1.53, 1.60, 1.62 and1.96 and is extending the comment period until March 3, 1989. The Officealso is not adding new rule 37 CFR 1.21(n) which refers to 37 CFR 1.53,1.60 and 1.62. The Office is amending only that portion of 37 CFR 1.55which clarifies that the already established fee refers to the amount inthe new 37 CFR 1.17(i)(1) and not the old andSection; 1.71(i). After theextended comment period closes the Office will issue a new notice of finalrulemaking addressing these proposals.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two respondents requested that the Office provide fora comment period longer than the 30 days accorded in this rule package.<T3>Response: </T3>Office policy is to provide a 60 day comment periodwhenever possible. For fee-related rules, the comment period generallyis limited to 30 days because the final rule must be in place 60 days beforethe fees are effective. This gives the public at least 90 days notice ofa fee change.In addition, the Office alerts, as far in advance as possible, major patentand trademark associations and organizations, and its advisory committees,that it will be proposing a fee adjustment. Finally, copies of the November30, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice were mailed to 140 organizations, associationsand the advisory committees only days after their publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent asked whether maintenance fees that arepaid after the effective date of the fee increase are payable in the increasedamount or the amount that was payable when due.<T3>Response: </T3>The amount of any fee payment made on or after the effectivedate of this rule package is the amount set in the rulemaking.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two respondents, representing major trademark organizations,opposed the proposed reductions to the trademark application and assignmentfees. The following major points were made: (1) No reductions should bemade until November 1989, when Pub. L. 100-667 (The Trademark Law RevisionAct of 1988) is implemented; (2) leading accounting firms recommend thata one year's operating reserve would be prudent; (3) it was Congressionalintent that revenue generated from a $100 assignment fee be used to subsidizethe trademark operation.The respondents also questioned whether the PTO could make more than oneadjustment every three years under the present authorization statute, evenwhen such adjustments would result in a reduction of certain fee amounts.<T3>Response: </T3>After careful consideration of the comments received,the PTO has decided to implement the two fee reductions for the followingreasons: (1) Careful analysis has confirmed that projected revenues willbe sufficient to implement the Intent-to-Use legislation (Pub. L. 100-667)and still maintain an operating reserve within PTO's two percent fee policy.We believe it will take about 18 months' experience with intent-to-useto be able to propose other changes to trademark fee amounts, and thusa delay in implementation of the proposed fee reductions to November 1989would not accomplish any useful purpose. (2) a one-year operating reservefor trademark programs is far too large an amount to address unforeseenexpenses, would unfairly penalize users, is politically imprudent, especiallygiven the current Federal deficit, and could be construed to constitutean unfair tax on the general user. (3) in the past, PTO has been criticizedfor charging $100 for a trademark assignment and $7.00 for a patent assignment.For example, refer to public comments on the 1986 trademark fee adjustmentspublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 4, 1986 at 51 FR 28055. While it istrue that the trademark assignment fee was originally designed to helpsubsidize the trademark application fee, which is set at a level that doesnot recover actual costs, the PTO believes that the proposed reductionin the assignment fee will not result in subsequent increases in the applicationfee or jeopardize the financial health of trademark operations. Further,the Office wants to assure respondents that in proposing a reduction inthe assignment fee, the costs of cleaning up the trademark assignment database have been taken into account.As noted above, the planning of fee adjustments has been such that we donot anticipate two adjustments within a fee cycle. The legislative historyto Pub. L. 99-607 indicates that Congress intended the PTO to reduce feeswhenever appropriate.<T3>Comment: </T3>One respondent, a representative of a major patent organization,raised the following points: (1) The PTO should conduct an analysis ofthe impact of patent fees on independent inventors and small businesses;(2) the reduction of fees for individual inventors and small business shouldcontinue to be subsidized by taxpayer revenues; (3) the PTO should makeevery effort to increase its efficiency as a way of holding down the levelof fees; (4) the PTO and the Administration should attempt to amend theGramm-Rudman-Hollings Act as it relates to user fees; and (5) the Officeshould allow 90 days for the public to comment on proposed rules.<T3>Response: </T3>(1) The PTO continually has monitored the level of filingsby small businesses and individual inventors, which has averaged 34 percentfor the years 1986-1988. The Office will conduct a study to assess theimpact of patent fees on individual inventors and small businesses.(2) For the 1989-91 fee cycle, the reduction of patent fees for individualinventors and small businesses will continue to be subsidized by taxpayerrevenues. As the PTO continues to progress to total financing by user fees,two options will be explored: (a) To continue to seek general taxpayerrevenue for the subsidy to domestic and foreign users alike; or (b) toestablish a two tier fee system for patent statutory fees. While the firstoption could mean lower overall patent fees, a taxpayer subsidy would bedependent upon Congressional action. If Congress were not to appropriatethe necessary funds, the subsidy would not be available, in whole or inpart. Full reliance on user fees could provide the PTO with additionalflexibilities to meet user needs, especially in responding to growing workloadsas the workloads occur.(3) The PTO continues to scrutinize its operating budgets to identify waysto increase efficiency, to constrain costs, and to continue to providebetter services to its users. The current fee package permits patent andpatent service fees to be raised only with inflation. Trademark fees areheld steady or are reduced. Despite these limited adjustments, user feesin 1989-1991 will allow the PTO to continue to pursue its major goals toimprove the quality and timeliness of its goods and services.(4) The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sequestration of 1986 did affect PTO userfees. However, the Administration's budgets for 1987, 1988 and 1989 metall deficit reduction targets and did not require automatic sequestrations.We are confident that the Administration will continue to meet all deficitreduction targets prescribed by law and thus will continue to avoid theautomatic sequestrations. The PTO is supportive of all efforts to reducethe Federal deficit.(5) This issue was addressed above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Considerations</ITAG>The rule change is in conformity with the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), Executive Orders 12291 and 12612, andthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> There are no information collection requirements relatingto patent fee rules.The Office has determined that this notice has no Federalism implicationsaffecting the relationship between the National Government and the Statesas outlined in Executive Order 12612.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theChief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the rulechange will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354).The principal impact of the major patent fees has already been taken intoaccount in Pub. L. 99-607, which provided small entities with a 50 percentreduction in the major patent fees. The rule change adjusts fees to reflectthe change in the CPI and cost of processing services as provided by statute(35 U.S.C. 41(d) and 41(f)).The Office has determined that this rule change is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291. The annual effect on the economy will be less than$100 million. There will be no major increase in costs or prices for consumers,individual industries, Federal, state, or local government agencies, individualindustries, Federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographicregions, because most major fees are being adjusted to reflect changesin the CPI over the past three years. There will be no significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>37 CFR Part 1Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, Freedom of information,Inventions and patents, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Smallbusinesses.37 CFR Part 2Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, Lawyers, Trademarks.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Office is amending Title37 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter I, as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_RULES OF PRACTICE IN PATENT CASES</ITAG>1.
