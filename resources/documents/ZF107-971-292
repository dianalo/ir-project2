 It turns outthat bricks, not management knowhow, kept MiniScribe in the black.andP;  Baffledcustomers, finding no easy way to hook up the bricks, quickly returned them.andO;Always the innovator, MinisCribe then inflated its inventory figures by thepurported cost of the bricks, claiming $4.3 million in sales.andP;  Such financialshenanigans were routine, according to a $2 million, six-month internalinvestigation of the Longmont, Colorado, company, conducted by a committee ofoutside directors.andP;  The panel concluded that the company's former seniormanagement apparently &quot;perpetrated a massive fraud on the company, itsdirectors, its outside auditors, and the investing public.&quot;andP;  The report alsospeculates that in 1986 senior officials tampered with year-end auditstatements by breaking into locked trunks containing the auditors' workpapers and inflating inventory values by $1 million.andP;  MiniScribe, the subjectof 13 shareholder lawsuits filed since it began reporting losses, called in1989 for the investigation, hoping to produce information to defend thecompany against its litigants.andP;  The company is recalculating its financialresults since 1986.andP;  No one is certain if a true picture of its finances canever be determined....andP;  Meanwhile, there is no truth to the rumor that Applehas decided to drop the Mac's problematic Quantum drives and go with thosemanufactured by the Merry Brick Company.andM;One Bad AppleandM;Investigators from Japan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) raided the offices ofApple Computer Japan and its largest authorized Japanese distributor, CanonSales Company, a subsidiary of Canon.andP;  The two companies are accused oftrying to oust gray-market importers from the Japanese market, where theyoperate legally.andP;  The commission is investigating charges that Canon Salesstrong-armed four computer magazines into rejecting advertisements placed byindependent importers, while Apple Japan allegedly pressured two PC repairshops not to fix Macintoshes sold by the discounters.andP;  The dealers reportedlyplanned to advertise the Mac Plus for about $1,400.andP;  Canon sells the modelfor about $2,700.andP;  Apple and Canon officials deny the allegations and saythey are puzzled by the investigation but have pledged full cooperation.andM;Some speculate that recent trade disputes between the two countries provokedthe FTC's actions.andP;  Japan may simply be using Apple as a tool to muffleAmerican complaints about high prices.andP;  A former senior official in theDepartment of Commerce told MacWeek that investigating an American company&quot;is a beautiful way of sticking a knife in the ribs of the Americannegotiators.&quot;andP;  If the charges are true, it would certainly be a switch.andP;  Foryears, American companies have justifiably complained that their goods arekept at artificially high prices in Japan.andM;Boys Will Be BoysandM;Recent cases involving teenage mutant ninja hackers may indicate a need forclassroom instruction in ethical computing.andP;  A 15-year-old boy used his PC tobreak into a VAX computer of the Grumman Corporation, a major militarycontractor in Bethpage, New York.andP;  The company says that no military secretswere compromised, but the breach was serious and it will prosecute.andM;In another case, a 14-year-old from Fresno, California, stumbled upon a codethat let him make long-distance phone calls without paying for them.andP;  Hecalled up BBSs across the country and obtained the TRW credit bureau'ssubscriber code through a clandestine exchange.andP;  With several Citibank creditcard numbers he encountered therein, he embarked on a $5,000mail-order-merchandise spending spree.andP;  And the long distance calls came inat $6,000.andM;The teen hacker was generous--sharing credit card numbers with as many as 60bulletin boards across the country.andP;  &quot;He gets an A for ingenuity, but he'sgoing to get three to five [years],&quot; gibes a Citibank spokesperson.andP;  TRWplans to prosecute for illegal access of its computer system, Citibank forfraud.andP;  Police have seized the young hacker's computer equipment and areholding the parents financially responsible for Junior's &quot;achievements.&quot;andM;Grumman has received complaints that it should refrain from prosecutingchildren.andP;  Meanwhile, a speaker at the 12th National Computer SecurityConference told the audience that U.S.andP;  corporations' willingness to employ,rather than jail, hackers sends a clear message that crime pays.andP;  Grumman,however, intends to convey a different message.andP;  Says spokesperson MiriamReid: &quot;If you get us, we're going to get you.&quot;andM;Long Live the King!andM;This news just in from that bastion of tough journalism, the NationalExaminer: Elvis is still alive.andP;  Experts from a top-secret British computercompany that does work for Britain's Defense Ministry and Scotland Yard haveverified that a man in a photograph taken seven years after the King'salleged death could be the Hound Dog himself.andP;  Using &quot;every computer device&quot;available, reports the highly respected Examiner, the bewildered Britscouldn't prove that the man, seen in the background of a newspaper photo ofMuhammed Ali and Jesse Jackson, wasn't Elvis.andP;  And you thought the PCjrwasn't good for anything.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
