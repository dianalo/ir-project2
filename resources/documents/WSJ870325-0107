Many bank issuers of Visa cards and Mastercards are concerned that the Optima card will touch off a rate war that could dampen profits.    Pei-yuan Chia, head of Citicorp's credit card business, said &quot;I don't believe the battle will be drawn on pricing&quot; but on other things such as acceptance of Optima by merchants. He said that Visa and Mastercard each are accepted by twice as many merchants as the American Express card.    The new card, which will be offered in June to existing American Express card holders with good credit records, will carry an initial annual interest rate of 13.5%. In contrast, the average bank card interest rate nationwide is currently 17.82%, according to Bank Credit Card Observer, a monthly newsletter. With nine million credit card accounts, Citicorp is the nation's largest credit card issuer. It currently charges 19.8% on its regular Visa cards and Mastercards.    Separately, Citicorp said it is installing a new generation of &quot;touch-screen&quot; automated teller machines in its 275 New York area banking locations, replacing machines installed in 1977. The new machines, which allow a customer to perform banking transactions by touching the screen instead of a keyboard, include color displays and a choice of English, Spanish and Chinese at all locations. Citicorp declined to disclose the cost of the changeover.    William J. Heron Jr., head of U.S. consumer banking, said Citicorp would &quot;look for an acquisition opportunity in New Jersey in the next six to 12 months.&quot; Beginning next year, New York banks will be able to acquire New Jersey banks as a result of a recent change in New Jersey law.    Additionally, Richard S. Braddock, head of all consumer banking, predicted that Citicorp's Florida and California thrifts will become profitable in 1987; its Illinois thrift posted a profit for the first time in 1986.    Mr. Braddock also said consumer credit write-offs as a percentage of average net receivables will &quot;decline marginally&quot; in 1987 from 1.58% in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
