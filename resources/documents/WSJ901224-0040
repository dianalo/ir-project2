The exchange said it expects to begin trading thecontracts, each of which represent 40,000 pounds of broilers,on Feb. 7, 1991.</LP><TEXT>   A previous version faded into dormancy in 1982 becausetraders were frustrated with its cumbersome deliveryprovisions. To fix that, the Merc devised a contract thatdoesn't require physical delivery of the underlying broilers.   Instead, the new contract will use an unusual cashsettlement system based on the Agriculture Department's12-city average price report on Grade A broilers.   Contracts will be traded for delivery in February, April,May, June, July, August, October and December.   As approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,the speculative limit is 2,000 broiler contracts in allcontract months combined. Speculators are limited to 500contracts in any specific contract month.   The exchange slashed its original proposal for aspeculative limit of an enormous 10,000 contracts in alltrading months combined after the CFTC raised questions.   The CFTC is still considering a Merc proposal to tradeoptions on the broiler futures contracts.</TEXT></DOC>
