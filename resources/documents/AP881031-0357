A fifth insurance company also is expected to agree to pay $6million, increasing the settlement to $61 million, according toCandace Fabri, an attorney for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   The agreement settles a lawsuit originally filed by Continentalshareholders against the supervisors of John Lytle, former bankvice president. The suit claimed Lytle's superiors were negligentin failing to prevent him from buying risky loans from Penn SquareBank in Oklahoma City, Okla.   The insurance companies had policies covering variousContinental executives and therefore were liable, Ms. Fabri said.Former bank Chairman Roger Anderson and former President DonaldMiller were among those named in the lawsuit.   Lytle was accused of making risky loan deals that cost the bankmillions of dollars and contributed to the FDIC's decision torescue Continental Illinois with a $4.5 billion bailout in 1984.   Last summer, Lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bankfunds and was sentenced to 3{ years in federal prison. He wasaccused by government prosecutors of accepting kickbacks disguisedas personal, low-interest loans in exchange for arranging to haveContinental take risky loans off Penn Square's hands.   William Patterson, former Penn Square vice president, pleadedguilty to aiding and abetting Lytle and was sentenced to 2 years.   When the FDIC became the owner of 80 percent of the bank's stockas part of the rescue, it inherited the shareholder suit, said Ms.Fabri.   Under the settlement, National Union Insurance will pay $28million; Harbor Insurance Co. will pay $15 million; AllstateInsurance Co. will pay $9 million; and First State Insurance willpay $3 million, Ms. Fabri said.   A fifth company, CNA Insurance, was expected to agree to thesettlement and pay $6 million, she said.   As part of the settlement, nearly $14 million will be given topeople who held Continental stock from Sept. 1, 1981 through July5, 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
