Lainhart IV, the Transportation Department'sassistant inspector general for Policy, Planning and Resources, received thePaul R. Boucher Public Service Award from President Bush this month.andM;As part of the multiple-agency project, Transportation's Office of theInspector General took a leading role in working with auditors for theparticipating agencies' IG offices, to assess management controls overoperating system software and security.andM;Ten federal data centers were involved in the study.andP;  Nine of the 10 used theIBM Corp. MVS operating system.andM;The first objective of the study was to determine whether operating systemfeatures that give individuals the authority to access sensitive informationwere administered and controlled properly.andP;  The second objective was to checkwhether enviromental security software mechanisms designed to limit useraccess to sensitive information were administered and controlled properly.andM;The reviews revealed that all had operating system and security softwaredeficiencies.andP;  For the IBM MVS systems, the weaknesses were caused whenemployees shut off security checks, sometimes converting standard computerterminals into a master operatorhs console.andM;This meant someone could take control over each agency's computer system andaccess, alter or destroy sensitive data or other resources without leaving anaudit trail.andM;Ignoring SecurityandM;How was it so easy for the project team to penetrate every computer systemwithout exception?andP;  Lainhart pointed to inadequate attention paid to securitybecause employees thought it was too technical.andP;  &quot;Even though vendors toldthem how to secure their systems software, the centers installed packageswithout implementing all the security features,&quot; he said.andM;Additionally, the review assessed the efficiency of storage management at theagencies.andP;  Using custom-built software, the project team revealed that $17million of wasted disk storage could be recovered for reallocation.andP;  Thismove deferred a number of budgeted capital purchases of storage devices.andM;With DOT, there are 50 mainframes running more than 20 major applications.andO;The Office of Information Resources Management within the Office of theSecretary of Transportation controls procurement and provides informationsystems policies and procedures.andM;Within the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), an IBM 9375 Model 60midrange processor runs under VM.andP;  It hooks to large IBM or Armdahlmainframes at the DOT Admistrative Data Center in Washington and the FederalAviation Administration data center in Oklahoma City.andM;The OIG has installed identical menu-driven systems on the three computers toease the development and maintenance of programs.andM;Its software portfolio ambitious.andP;  For information retrieval and analysis,the agency used Dyl-238II and Dyl-Audit Excel from the Dylakor Division ofSterling Software in Chatsworth, Calif.andM;The OIG also used Focus from Information Builders Inc. of New York.andP;  For dataanalysis and graphical presentation, it relied on AS from the SAS InstituteInc. of Cary, N.C.andM;Many of the analytical tools used by the auditors were developed in-houseusing the Dylakor fourth-generation audit systems.andP;  The programmers did notuse Cobol.andM;Finding WeaknessesandM;Using the Dyl family of products, OIG developed Scrubber to pinpoint securityweaknesses in the IBM MVS operating system.andP;  Scrubber is a set of assemblylanguage routines and Dylakor data retrieval and analysis programs thatanalyze operating system software.andP;  The program also analyzes certain aspectsof disk storage usage.andP;  Scrubber was written in-house, using Dyl-280,Dyl-280, and assembly language.andM;Scrubber is the second significant piece of software developed by DOT/OIGpersonnel.andP;  The first system, called Seeker, is a multiple correlationsoftware for matching files.andM;In one application, Seeker was used to compare FAA pilot medical recordsagainst the national registry of drunken driving and drug-relatedconvictions.andP;  DOT used Seeker to match pilot records to FBI records toidentify the individual pilots.andP;  This effort has resulted in more than 100at-risk pilots being convicted or losing their licenses.andM;The OIG is using a methodology that emphasizes the importance and use ofautomated auditing techniques.andP;  Through the use of information technology,the OIG adresses areas for substantial financial payback, legislativevisibility, and correction of life-threatening situations.andM;&quot;Using a variety of automated techniques, we looked at both the operatingsystem enviroment and enviromental security software enviroment at each ofthe 10 computer centers,&quot; Lainhart said.andM;These computer centers are responsible for the annual disbursement of $230billion and controlled funds up to $1.3 trillion.andM;Transportation's OIG started with an audit of its own data center.andP;  An auditteam determined that anyone with a detailed knowledge of the inner workingsof MVS, IBM's most powerful operating system, can find trap doors.andP;  Even thepresence of propriety security systems could not prevent unauthorized access.andM;At first, the audit team manually determined the technical holes or entrancesto crack a security system using a brute force approach.andM;To automate this process, he developed utilities to probe the more criticalcotrol points within MVS systematically.andP;  Developed within DOT, Scrubber is acollection of those utilities.andM;A number of modules within Scrubber examine critical control points for theoperating system.andP;  It maneuvers through the operating system to determinewhat resources are active, what are available, and how the security softwareis involved.andM;Scrubber explores potential operating system weakness.andP;  First, it looks atSupervisor Call Instructions (SVCs).andP;  SVCs provide sensitive services onbehalf of an application program, such as when a file is opened.andM;In MVS, the first 200 SVCs come from IBM and are guaranteed to be free fromdefects that would cause an integrity exposure.andP;  But most data centers havedeveloped unique SVCs to support custom applications for particularinstallations.andP;  Often these SVCs help grant special privileges toapplications.andM;These SVCs often expose a data center to unpredictable integrity risks.andM;At each MVS data center, the OIG team demonstrated that, despite theexistence of elaborate security software, it could take complete control ofthe entire computer system.andP;  That means it had unlimited ability to inspect,copy, alter, or delete files without leaving an audit trail.andP;  It obtainedthese capabilities by converting a regular TSO terminal into a mirror imageof the master operator's console.andM;The OIG team looked at more than integrity issues.andP;  &quot;We had indications therewere problems in the storage management area,&quot; said David F Kent, director ofthe Office of ADP Audits and Technical Support.andP;  &quot;Also, we wanted to offer acombination of integrity issues and dollar issues to elicit the boadestparticipation.andM;Sound storage admistration calls for data to be stored on the least-expensivemedia available.andP;  Using a Scrubber routine, the Transportation OIG teamdetermined how efficiently each data center used its data storage andreported its findings.andP;  The study identified a significant number of databasefiles that were either redundant, unnecessary, or candidates for migration toless-expensive tape media.andM;Freeing Up SpaceandM;By recapturing the space freed by following these recommendations, datacenters would be able to save $17 million of storage.andP;  At DOT, it waspossible to deter a $2.5 million direct-access storage device procurement asa result of freed up space.andM;In addition to some technical shortcomings, the President's Council onIntegrity and Efficiency computer systems integrity project also revealedsome questionable management practices.andM;Reviews of the security privileges at data centers revealed that mostagencies grant superuser privileges to too many people.andP;  At everyinstallation, that number exceeded the levels recommended by the vendor ofthe installed security system.andM;Lainhart said he was pleased senior management of many data centers stoppedthis practice quickly by allowing access to computer information on only aneed-to-know basis.andP;  At one agency, the number of people having superuserprivileges was reduced from more than 100 to five.andM;&quot;Most information systems managers took action as soon as problems werebrought to their attention,&quot; Lainhart said.andP;  &quot;That was gratifying.andP;  Whileonly 25 systems were looked at, their problems are applicable to allagencies.&quot;andM;The whole government can benefit from DOT's work, Lainhart said.andP;  &quot;For me,the biggest benefit is the heightened awareness of this problemgovernmentwide, as evidenced by the director of the Office of Management andBudget's decisive reaction directing heads of executive departments andagencies to examine our report and take immediate action,&quot; he said.andM;John Kador owns a communications agency in Geneva, Ill.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
