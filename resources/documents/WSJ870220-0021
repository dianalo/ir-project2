Citicorp recently had been taking a hard line in negotiations with debtor countries, blocking settlements with Chile and the Philippines and, in the process, infuriating U.S. government officials in Washington. Now, bankers are asking if Citicorp's softening in the Chilean talks is a prelude to a general easing of its approach to debt talks.    In the Chilean debt talks, Citicorp had been at odds with other major bank creditors over how $450 million of new loans should be provided to Santiago.    Citicorp had previously insisted on raising an entirely new loan to meet Chile's need for fresh funds, banking sources said. But the other banks disagreed with this approach, insisting instead that Chile should make loan repayments on its bank debt every 12 months instead of every six months. This realignment, extended to the end of 1988, would effectively give Chile $450 million because of the extra time the country will have access to funds already lent, banking sources said.    A spokesman for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., which chairs the bank committee negotiating with Chile, said talks were making better progress but declined to commment further. A Citicorp spokesman referred questions to Manufacturers Hanover Trust.    Chile has a total foreign debt of about $21.4 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
