Congressional leaders from both parties are expected to meet today with President Reagan at the White House to discuss the matter. Democrats, who are skeptical about White House peace overtures offered when the administration is preparing to seek additional aid for the Contras, are insisting that they hear the details of the plan directly from the president. The administration has been planning to ask Congress for at least $105 million for the rebels.    In the atmosphere of mistrust created by the Iran-Contra hearings, acceptance of the plan would be &quot;an act of faith on our part,&quot; said a House Democrat leadership aide.    House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas), who is taking an active role in the issue, initially was approached on behalf of the administration by a fellow Texan, former GOP congressman Thomas Loeffler. Mr. Loeffler was recently brought into the White House to assist in the Contra-aid effort. In assuming this active role, Mr. Wright risks getting ahead of his own party's leadership, which has yet to commit itself to the proposal.    Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia was described after a party caucus yesterday as still &quot;skeptical.&quot; The real test for both leaders will be the younger liberal Democrats who have consistently opposed aid to the Contras.    Some conservatives, too, are expected to have doubts about the proposal. They believe that the chances of winning congressional support for more Contra aid have been bolstered by the popularity of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, the fired National Security Council staff member and staunch Contra supporter who emerged from the televised Iran-Contra hearings as a hero.    The timing of the proposal also has raised some suspicions. The heads of government of the five Central American nations are meeting this week in Guatemala to consider a regional peace plan, authored by Costa Rica's president. The Reagan administration hasn't been enthusiastic about that plan. If the White House can forge a bipartisan agreement for its plan, it could undercut the Central American effort.    Under the U.S proposal, the administration wouldn't submit its request for additional Contra aid before Sept. 30. During the two months until then, cease-fire negotiations would begin, and when terms are agreed upon, the U.S. would suspend military aid to the Contras. During the same period, Managua would stop receiving aid from the Soviet bloc and would suspend its emergency laws, which curtail certain civil liberties. The plan also calls for the Sandinistas to restore other political rights and establish an electoral commission to prepare for open elections.    Managua previously has rejected negotiating conditions on how it conducts its internal political affairs. Yesterday, an official at the Nicaraguan Embassy here called the proposal &quot;a starting position for American negotiators to take to Nicaragua.&quot; He said the plan contained some positive elements, especially a proposal to open bilateral negotiations between the two nations. Such talks had been broken off by the U.S. two years ago.    But the plan contains a time element that could hurt Democrats who oppose Contra aid. If negotiations on the cease-fire package aren't completed by Sept. 30, the administration would be free to return to Congress for Contra aid. &quot;If a bipartisan agreement is proposed to the Sandinistas and they turn it down, members of Congress would see once and for all that the Sandinistas aren't serious, and Congress would finally have no choice but to vote for Contra aid,&quot; said an administration official. </TEXT></DOC>
