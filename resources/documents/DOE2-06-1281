<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-1281 </DOCNO><TEXT>CCEMRI(I) (1985) has recommended that from January 1st 1986 the PrimaryStandard Dosimetry Laboratories (PSDLs) should adopt new values for W/e(33.97 J/C), stopping powers for electrons (ICRU Report 37, 1984), gvalue in air for /sup 60/Co (3.2 x 10/sup -3/), and energy absorptioncoefficients. The consistency of the whole dosimetric chain requiresthe same basic physical data at the users' beam quality and PSDLs, butmost of the existing dosimetry protocols are not generally based on sucha set of data and in some cases old and new data have been employed together.A review of the basic data included in the dosimetry protocols is presented,together with a comparison with experimental data. The most recent datainclude the recommendations of CCEMRI(I) and at the same time, some ofthe inconsistencies existing in dosimetry protocols have been eliminated.The new set of data is presented in this work. New dosimetry protocolsand updated versions of protocols published before 1986 are discussedin terms of their basic data. 46 refs.; 1 figure; 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
