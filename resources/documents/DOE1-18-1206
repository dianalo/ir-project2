The initial work wascarried out with solutions of LiCl in water and in pyridine, and a simple,water-soluble chromium salt CrCl{sub 3}(period on line) 6H{sub 2}0 wasused to reduce the relaxation time of the lithium ion without line broadeningeffects. Single pulse natural abundance spectra were obtained, from whichthe isotopic ratio was determined, with a precision of andless; 3%.</TEXT></DOC>
