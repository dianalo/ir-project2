In other primary voting in three states, two Republicanex-congressmen compete for the right to challenge Michigan'sliberal Democratic Sen. Donald Riegle, and a former Missouri firstlady, Betty Hearnes, bids for a chance to become that state's firstwoman governor.   Kansas also has primaries, with contests in three of fivecongressional districts. The only incumbent challenged in a primaryis GOP Rep. Jan Meyers, who is seeking a third term in the 3rdDistrict. She is favored over Charles B. ``Bat'' Masterson, 73, aretired school administrator.   Two well-known names appear on Missouri primary ballots.   Rep. Richard Gephardt filed at the last minute for a seventhterm after dropping his presidential bid. Most of the Democrats whohad entered the 3rd District race then withdrew, but threelittle-known contenders remained on the ballot.   And in the 8th District, farm activist Wayne Cryts, who gainednational attention in 1981 taking soybeans out of a padlocked,bankrupt grain elevator, will seek the Democratic nomination tooppose Republican Rep. Bill Emerson. Cryts lost to Emerson by 8,000out of 150,000 votes cast in 1986.   Missouri's 2{-year-old lottery suffered a $24 million drop insales during the last fiscal year, and officials are blamingrestrictions specifying that exactly 45 percent of lottery proceedsgo for prizes and 10 percent for administrative costs, includingadvertising.   A measure on the ballot would amend the rules, making prizemoney a minimum of 45 percent of proceeds and allowing the state tospend more on advertising. Proponents say that would make thelottery more appealing and increase sales.   Mrs. Hearnes, a 61-year-old state representative whose husbandWarren was governor from 1965 to 1973, is hoping to unseatRepublican Gov. John Ashcroft. She has Democratic opposition onlyfrom Lavoy ``Zaki'' Reed, a St. Louis area teacher.   In Michigan, both Jim Dunn and Robert Huber have sought to makeRiegle's liberalism the issue, saying he's out of tune with voters.But the 50-year-old incumbent says he's happy to defend a votingrecord that brought him a 100 percent score in a recent survey byAmericans for Democratic Action.   Riegle, Michigan's senior senator, has $4 million in campaignfunds and faces no opposition in the Democratic primary as he seeksa third term. He also emphasizes that he's expected to becomechairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban AffairsCommittee if he is re-elected.   Huber, 65, has portrayed himself as a staunch Reagan Republican,in favor of preserving federal income tax cuts, a strong defense,using more federal muscle in the war on drugs, and opposingabortion.   Dunn, 44, holds more moderate views. During his term inCongress, 1981-82, he supported most of Reagan's tax cut and budgetreduction policies, but often opposed the administration on socialissues and cuts in college aid.   AIDS became an issue in the race last week when Dunn said in aradio interview that he took ``a reasonable, rational, I think veryresponsible approach to the problems that face this nation. Mr.Huber has said that the reason people have AIDS is the wrath ofGod, punishment from God'' of homosexuals and drug users.   Huber, asked about Dunn's remarks, said ``I don't know whetherit's the wrath of God, but if it isn't it should be.''   Detroit Mayor Coleman Young's dream of bringing a string ofglittering hotel-casinos to an island in the Detroit River isshowing up on the ballot for the third time in 12 years. Opponentssponsored an intiative urging voters to go on record opposing theidea, which has been voted down both previous times.   Young has been pushing casinos as a way to bring jobs andtourism to a city with a 9.6 percent unemployment rate, but heacknowledges the advisory vote is likely to fail. ``If we win, itwill be the upset of all upsets,'' he said.   Gambling can be legalized only with approval of the Legislature.</TEXT></DOC>
