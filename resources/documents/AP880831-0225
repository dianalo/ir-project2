President Hussain Muhammed Ershad issued an international appealfor food, helicopters and boats after touring flooded areas in thecountryside, where people were throwing their dead into swirlingwaters because there was no dry land for burial.   Local newspapers in Thursday and Wednesday editions reported 140more flood-related deaths across the country Wednesday, raising thetoll in recent floods to 676.   Ershad said Wednesday the official death toll was 250, but thegovernment's count is generally considered low.   The independent newspaper Sangbad said most of the victims itreported died when boats sank or houses collapsed. But it said somewere killed when they were bitten by snakes in the water.   ``We need food grains, helicopters and river craft from ourfriends for tackling the flood,'' Ershad told reporters.``Everywhere I have gone people have asked for drinking water.''   In Dhaka, the capital, residents stocked food, anticipating thatfloods would force markets to close.   Several thousand residents from a low-lying area on thesoutheastern outskirts of the city were evacuated Wednesday aswaters from flooded Buriganga breached a protection dam and a10-mile road.      At Victoria Park in the oldest part of Dhaka, about 3,000 peoplecamped out with the few possessions they rescued from their floodedhomes.   ``We have now become one family. We are not only sharing ourcommon sorrows. We are also sharing whatever little we have,'' saidMohammadullah, a vegetable seller.   Tears rolled down his face as he told how his 5-year-olddaughter Rahima Khatoon drowned in her sleep Tuesday when she felloff her bed into the rising water at Keraniganj on the outskirts ofDhaka.   Hundreds of people made their way to a high road near theBuriganga River.   Abdul Hye, a 35-year-old government clerk, put his two smallchildren on his shoulders as he waded toward a shelter for refugees.   His wife, Naila Begum, propelled a pushcart loaded with thefamily's valuables and their white cat, Beauty.   ``We cannot let her die,'' Naila said as she petted the cat.``She will go with us wherever we go.''   The Relief Ministry estimated that nearly one-third of thenation's population of 105 million was affected by the floods. Someareas had only a few inches of water, while in remote northernregions people scrambled up trees with their children and meagerfoodstuffs and waited for the water to go down.   Municipal officials in Dhaka, a city of 4 million, estimatedone-quarter of the city was affected by floods. Speaking oncondition of anonymity, they said up to three-fourths of thesprawling capital could be covered with water before the end of theweek.   Other officials, also speaking privately, estimated that 100,000displaced people were seeking shelter in the capital's makeshiftrelief camps, open parks, streets and with relatives.   Floodwaters ranged from waist-deep at spots in Mirpur on theoutskirts of Dhaka to 2 inches outside an office building whoseupper floors house the U.S. Embassy in the Motijheel commercialdistrict.   Thousands of laborers and volunteers worked around the clock toplug minor breaches in the embankment designed to protect Dhakafrom the Buriganga during floodtime.   So far, few deaths have been reported in Dhaka. Most of thefatalities have occurred at least 40 miles from the capital.   Rail service has been suspended in many areas because the tracksare flooded. Train and boats are the main form of transport inBangladesh, where the scores of mighty rivers overflow every summerand wash out roads.   Ershad said flood damage this year would be ``many timeshigher'' than last year's loss of $1 billion.   In 1987, floods killed more than than 1,200 people inBangladesh, where the per capita income is $150 a year and 90percent of the population lives below the poverty level, which isdefined as being able to afford a diet of 2,000 calories a day.</TEXT></DOC>
