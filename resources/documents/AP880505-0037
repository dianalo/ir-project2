For those women, growing old brings an economic nightmare asthey face life without a spouse, steady income or adequate healthbenefits, according to the Older Women's League, a group workingfor social reforms for women.   America must do more than ``take a once-a-year look atmotherhood,'' Lou Glasse, the league's president, said Wednesday.   ``It is not enough to buy us off with cards and flowers,'' shesaid. ``These women deserve significant economic support from asociety which they have supported all their lives.''   The group, which has 20,000 members, launched a campaign onCapitol Hill for pension reforms, better health care for theelderly and increased job protection and benefits for mothers whowork.   Too many Americans believe that older women enjoy a ``golden oldage, surrounded by loving and adoring children, spouses andfriends,'' Ms. Glasse said.   ``We do not deny that this is the reality for some,'' she said.``But there is another America in which older women do not reap thebenefits of a lifetime of hard work, in which older women live inpoverty and isolation.''   The group released a report, compiled from Census and otherdata, showing that 72 percent of the poor over age 65 are women andthat a woman's chances of being poor increase if she is black orHispanic, divorced, widowed or separated.   Women constitute the majority of the elderly living alone, butmore than half have been alone for at least 10 years and a quarterhave no surviving children to provide assistance if needed, thereport said.   The disparity between men and women in median income is greatestfor midlife women aged 45-54, the report said. Only four women in10 are currently vested in pension plans. And job interruptions forhaving children or caring for a family member affect promotions,salary and retirement benefits.   ``This is a conspiracy of circumstances that work throughout awoman's life to consign her to poverty,'' Ms. Glasse said.   The group presented members of Congress with Mother's Day cardsoutlining the report and the legislation they want to have enacted.The group supports Medicare coverage for long-term home care,expanded coverage of adult day care, catastrophic health care forthe elderly, an increase in the minimum wage, employee benefits forpart-time workers, passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act andother health care measures.   Norma Downey, mother of Rep. Thomas Downey, a member of theHouse Select Committee on Aging, gave her son a Mother's Day cardwith instructions to ``take its message to the floor of Congress.''   On Mother's Day this Sunday, ``too many women will spend the daywondering how they will be able to pay their rent, feed theirchildren and maintain some semblance of the American Dream,'' shesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
