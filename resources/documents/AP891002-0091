The court said it will review a ruling in a New Mexico case thatforces the government to free, on bail, some defendants deemed tobe dangerous or a risk to flee before trial.   A federal appeals court said pretrial release is required _ evenfor a defendant who otherwise could be held in custody _ if apretrial detention hearing is not held the first time that personappears before a judge or magistrate.   The justices in 1987 upheld a federal law allowing denial ofbail before trial to people deemed dangerous to the community, evenif accused of non-violent crimes.   Before the 1984 law, called the Bail Reform Act, pretrial bailgenerally would be denied only if a judge determined the defendantwas likely to flee.   In practice, however, federal judges could get around the oldlaw by setting very high bail, ostensibly aimed at guaranteeing thedefendant's appearance in court but effectively keeping the accusedin custody while awaiting trial.   A provision in the 1984 law states that a hearing to determinewhether pretrial detention is justified must be held ``immediatelyupon the person's first appearance before the judicial officer,unless that person or the attorney for the government seeks acontinuance.''   A federal trial judge and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsruled that the ``first appearance'' provision of the law had beenignored in the case of Guadalupe Montalvo-Murillo, charged withpossessing nearly $1 million worth of cocaine.   Montalvo-Murillo, a citizen of Mexico then legally living inthis country, was stopped last February while driving a pickuptruck near the Mexican border at Orogrande, N.M.   U.S. Customs Service agents found 72 pounds of cocaine, with awholesale value of almost $1 million, in the truck.   At a Feb. 16 proceeding, a federal magistrate put off adetention hearing until Feb. 21. After that hearing, the magistratedecided to release Montalvo-Murillo on $50,000 bail and otherconditions.   Government prosecutors appealed to a federal judge, who ruledthat Montalvo-Murillo posed both a danger to the community and arisk to flee.   But the judge ruled that the New Mexico magistrate, inpostponing the detention hearing for five days, violated thefederal bail law's ``first appearance'' rule. The judge said theonly appropriate remedy was the defendant's release on bail.   Montalvo-Murillo was freed on $88,500 bail, and has been afugitive from justice ever since. He is believed to have fled toMexico.   The 10th Circuit court upheld the judge's ruling that the onlyremedy for denying a defendant a timely detention hearing isrelease on bail _ even if the result of the hearing would have beenholding the defendant without bail.   In the appeal acted on today, government lawyers argued thatautomatic release for such procedural infractions is not requiredby the 1984 law.   ``The court of appeals erred in imposing a remedy so plainly atodds with the objectives of the Bail Reform Act,'' the appeal said.   Lawyers for Montalvo-Murillo urged the court to reject thegovernment's appeal, contending among other things that theirclient's status as a fugitive makes his case moot.   The case is U.S. vs. Montalvo-Murillo, 89-163.</TEXT></DOC>
