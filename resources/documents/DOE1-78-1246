Two parallel efforts are being performed atthe Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to help the electric utilityindustry take advantage of the expert system technology. The first effortis the development of expert system building tools which are tailoredto electric utility industry applications. The second effort is the developmentof expert system application prototypes. These two efforts complementeach other. The application development tests the tools and identifiesadditional tool capabilities which are required. The tool developmenthelps define the applications which can be successfully developed. Thispaper summarizes a number of research projects which are being performedat EPRI in both the areas of expert system building tool developmentand expert system applications to operations and maintenance. The AItechnology as demonstrated by the development is being established asa credible technological tool for the electric utility industry. A challengeto transferring the expert systems technology to the utility industryis to gain utility users' acceptance of this modern information technology.To achieve successful technology transfer, the technology developersneed to (1) understand the problems which can be addressed successfullyusing AI technology, (2) involve with users throughout the developmentand testing phases, and (3) demonstrate the benefits of the technologyby the users.</TEXT></DOC>
