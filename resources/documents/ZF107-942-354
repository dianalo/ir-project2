(Rumors)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Mac takes the long way homeandM;Mac the Knife's travel agent, who demanded anonymity, could only sigh whenthe last-minute call arrived requesting a direct flight to Malta departingDec.andP;  1 from Orange County's John Wayne International.andP;  The best the agentcould do on such short notice was a non-smoking aisle seat on a flight with anine-hour layover in Tripoli.andP;  Not particularly anxious to peruse the Libyanduty-free shop, the Knife reluctantly agreed to go the traditional routethrough Rome and take the Malta shuttle.andM;The long flight gave the Knife plenty of time to contemplate the three-dayorgy of conferencing and exhibiting just completed in Long Beach, Calif.andP;  TheMac Business Conference and Exposition, its name now upgraded toMacintosh/LA, may not have been the most exciting show of the year, but itcertainly had the best weather and beach life of any industry event of '89.andM;The Knife also had a lot of fun digging up the details of the CL/1 trademarksnafu.andP;  It appears that Apple was ready to ship several weeks ago when itdiscovered that a mainframe software publisher back East is the legal ownerof the CL trademark.andP;  The rumor making the rounds is that after a couple ofweeks of scrambling for a settlement, Apple was able to get an agreementallow-ing it to use the CL/1 name until August of next year, at which pointit will have to come up with a new name or cough up some royalty bucks.andM;Considering Apple's aversion to royalty payments, can there be any doubt?andO;The Knife's sources say the new name for CL/1 is most likely to be DataAccess Language, named after CL/1's query language.andP;  Whatever it's called,third-party developers hitching their collective carts to CL/1 are less thanamused at the prospect of having to alter their products to reflect the newtrademark infringement reality so soon.andP;  The good news is that CL/1 isexpected to ship momentarily and may share the introduction spotlight withone or two other Apple announcements.andM;The great unbundling.andP;  For a long time now System 7.0 watchers have beentelling the Knife that Personal AppleShare will be part of the package.andP;  Fora while they were right in this assumption, but judging from last-minutechanges in some Apple promotional materials, it looks as if Apple, forreasons unknown, may have put the distributed networking product on temporaryhold.andM;Also on the communications scene is the news that Avatar is close toannouncing a spiffy multi-user 3270 emulation gateway based on the DigiBoardmultisession communications board.andP;  This big step in Mac-to-mainframecommunications is due to ship in the first quarter of 1990.andM;Everyman's script.andP;  It's no secret that a number of Windows-based HyperCardcompetitors are in the works, including Echelon Development's Descartes,which originally was to be marketed by Spinnaker as WildCard.andP;  Sources tellthe Knife that they are not convinced Echelon will be able to avoid the legalwrath of Apple.andP;  The source of the apprehension in this case is that in itspresent form Descartes can read HyperCard stacks directly, unlike Plus, whichcan only read HyperCard stacks that have first been translated by the Macversion of Plus.andM;And while IBM has been talking to Spinnaker about some kind of bundling dealfor Plus, Asymetrix Corp.'s ToolBook, a pseudo object-oriented programmingenvironment designed for the forthcoming Windows 3.0, may yet get the BigBlue blessing.andP;  One source even claimed that IBM and Asymetrix are close tofinalizing a deal that will result in ToolBook becoming part of the systemsoftware IBM supplies with its new generation of personal iron.andM;Meanwhile, Apple has notified developers that the long-anticipated HyperCard2.0 is scheduled to go into beta testing in January.andM;No satisfaction.andP;  As if Apple didn't have enough problems getting sufficientquantities of screens and hard drives for the Mac Portable, some dealersreport that there also are problems with the injection molding process forthe case.andP;  Whatever the reason, it seems certain that there will be preciousfew under the tree this season.andM;Just think, regardless of what Sandra Day O'Connor and her buddies decide,you can still get one of Mac the Knife's MacWEEK mugs anytime you wantwithout parental notification.andP;  There's only one stipulation, and you knowwhat it is.andP;  Call the Mac at (415) 243-3500 or MCI (MactheKnife).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
