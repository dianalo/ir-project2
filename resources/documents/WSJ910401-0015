I don'tbelieve anything Kellogg tells me.&quot;   Asked about the lawsuit Friday, Mr. Gardner said &quot;truth isa defense&quot; against slander. &quot;They are liars.&quot;   Dan Morales, Texas attorney general, said in a statementthat the suit was &quot;an attempt to intimidate and harass astate employee doing his job.&quot;   Joseph M. Stewart, Kellogg's senior vice president forcorporate affairs, said Kellogg had never filed such a suitbefore, but that Kellogg officials believed they had to&quot;defend our good name.&quot; He also said Kellogg stands by itsads.   In August, Kellogg asked a federal court in Iowa to blockthat state's attorney general from acting against its healthclaims for the three cereals.
