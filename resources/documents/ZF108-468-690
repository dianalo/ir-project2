 Does what you earn reflect your true worth?andM;Unfortunately, in the course of our technical education, we don't get muchinformation on how to determine an individual's worth.andP;  Programmers areunnerved by gray areas and prefer to deal in analytical data rather thansubjective judgments.andP;  So salary surveys have become a necessary evil: theyprovide a logical basis for evaluating the going rate for programming staff,but they have several shortcomings.andM;The first flaw in salary survey is that they categorize individuals--aclassic contradiction.andP;  As much as we want them to, people don't fit intopigeonholes.andP;  As a result, when we categorize people, we end up generalizingby some factor, such as years of experience or responsibilities assumed.andM;Another flaw is that cold, hard cash isn't the only way you're paid.andO;Evaluating your salary is more complex than comparing numbers, just as fieldgoals and touchdowns are similar but different ways to earn points.andO;Traditionally, white-collar workers rank salary below achievement,recognition, opportunity for advancement, and the work itself.andP;  Let's faceit--we program because it's fun.andP;  But how do you include the fun factor in asalary survey?andM;If you use a salary survey only as a kernel and factor in a few subjectiveevaluations, you may get a clearer picture of what you're worth.andP;  Recruitingfirms, the trade press, and government agencies regularly publish salaryinformation.andP;  The figures published here are distilled from Datamation'sannual salary survey.andP;  [1]  It has a sample of corporation including ageneral sites and Fortune 1,000 companies.andM;Some surveys base salary data on years of experience, but time on the jobalone doesn't define programming skills or management instincts.andP;  And whilean indirect relationship exists between years of experience andresponsibilities, each programmer advances at a different rate.andP;  I prefersurveys like Datamation's that define salary levels according to jobdescriptions, levels of responsibility, and years of programming experience.andO;Following are the job levels used in collecting responses to Datamation'ssurvey:andM;* Entry--requires two to four years of college, six months of experience, anddirect supervision.andM;* Junior--requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent, at least two years ofexperience, and some directionandM;* Senior--requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent, at least three years ofexperience, and includes some supervisory functionsandM;* Lead--requires a bachelor's degree or equivalent, at least four years ofexperience (at least two in a supervisory capacity), and supervision as aproject manager.andM;However, the data includes another category falling somewhere between juniorand senior, which I'll call intermediate.andM;Programmers go by a variety of titles--and in most organizations titles don'tclearly describe our work.andP;  Datamation defines four positions: applicationsprogramming, systems analysis/programming, systems analysis, andoperating-systems programming.andP;  The definition for applications programmeris: &quot;develops, designs, and prepares programs.&quot;andP;  A systemsanalysis/programmer is described as someone who, &quot;performs systems analysisand applications programming.&quot;andP;  The differences are so slight that indistilling the data, I combined salary figures for the four groups.andM;The Datamation survey used a systematic, random selection from 344 replies toa questionnaire addressed to key information system staff at participatingorganizations.andP;  While the sample is relatively small, the numbers areconsistent with other surveys reviewed, and it included thorough regional andindustry detail.andP;  After combining the averages for the four defined groups ofprogrammers, the average salary rates nationwide by level of responsibilityfor 1989 are shown in Table 1.andM;The highest rates were awarded to systems analysts in the transportation andutilities fields; the lowest rates went to operating-systems programmers ineducation.andP;  Since the survey's respondents came from many industries,operating-systems programmers were not in high demand, which was reflected inthe overall salary data.andP;  However, if you consider only shops where theprimary product was software, you'd probably see greater demand and highersalaries for operating-systems experts.andP;  The lowest rate in the data sampleis for entry-level systems analysts in Dallas, Texas ($17,000).andP;  Compare thisto $66,500 for senior system analysts in Chicago, Ill.andM;Perks are part of a complete compensation package and a valuable toolcompanies use to motivate employees.andP;  The entrepreneur may earn more than theworking stiff, but stock options, educational opportunities, and insurancebenefits add to the corporate programmer's base salary.andP;  If you listen tobody shops, the contract programmer earns slightly more than the averageprogrammer but loses out on the equity of a larger company.andM;The regional disparities in the Datamation survey are somewhat surprising andprobably misleading.andP;  Table 2 shows the regional differences from theaverage.andM;To compare your salary to the going rate, take the average salary and add orsubtract the percentage of that rate for your region.andP;  For example, anintermediate-level programmer in Manhattan, N.Y., can expect to earn about$33,107, plus an additional $6,952 because of regional variation, for a totalof $40,059.andP;  But don't move to Los Angeles looking for the programming gold.andO;The higher salaries on the East and West Coasts reflect higher costs ofliving.andM;For example, the price of a single-family house in southern California isaround $250,000; northern California is a little higher.andP;  A Los Angeles-arearesident can expect to spend almost 40% of pretax income on a mortgage.andP;  Insmaller metropolitan areas in Illinois, Arkansas, and Texas, you can find asimilar house for $75,000.andM;Table 3 shows the regions included in the salary survey (Manhattan isincluded with New York) with their cost of living ratings as established byPlaces Rated Almanac.andP;  [2]  The index ranks 333 metropolitan areas; the leastexpensive are ranked lower.andP;  Factors evaluated include housing, food,transportation, and health care.andM;Your worth depends on where you work.andP;  My hometown in Orange County, Calif.,andO;is ranked the fourth most expensive place n the country to live.andP;  Despite thehigher salaries paid to programmers here, the cost of living offsets anyfinancial advantage.andM;The rising cost of living in Orange County is a direct result of a growingcommunity.andP;  On the other side of the coin, a growing community implies a realestate appreciation, improved amenities, high-quality health care andeducation, and increasing opportunities for career growth, either in new orestablished industries.andM;Salaries also vary by industry.andP;  Growing, successful industries are bound tohave better-paid programming staffs.andP;  Financial services are stillrecuperating from the 1987 crash, which is reflected in that industry'sprogramming salaries.andP;  In contrast, consumer manufacturing shops andtransportation industries are booming and tend to pay more.andM;Industry and regional forecasts can help you find out if you're getting whatyou're due.andP;  While service-oriented sectors are on an upward trend,product-oriented industries are on the decline.andP;  This means opportunitiesflourish for highly educated and trained service-oriented workers such asprogrammers.andM;Predictions show 335,000 new jobs for computer programmers nationwide between1986 and 2000.andP;  This number may be difficult to fathom in light of recentlayoffs at IBM and Apple.andP;  But the growth is expected to come only partiallyfrom the computer industry, whose dynamic growth has slowed, as is expectedin any maturing field.andP;  The 90s may show slower growth, but half of all newjobs in the next decade will be in service industries, with analysts andprogramming positions showing top percentage gains.andM;The laws of supply and demand apply to personnel as well as goods.andP;  In areaswith a high demand for programming staff, you're likely to be worth more thanin a no-growth region.andP;  Also, in a growing area, you may be able to lookforward to higher salaries, even if you're now paid less than the nationalaverage.andM;The Places Rated Almanac ratings in Table 4 factor in the percent increase innew jobs and the number of new jobs predicted between now and 1995.andP;  Thehighest rating is 1 (Orange County, Calif.) and the lowest is 333 (Casper,Wyo.).andM;While the Datamation survey shows that corporate programmers are paid less inSeattle, Wash., Places Rated Almanac ranks Seattle 36th from the top for jobgrowth, with an expected increase of nearly 70,000 new white-collarpositions.andP;  Seattle is rated number one as an overall great place to live,and it's home to four Fortune 500 companies and several high-tech firms,including Microsoft, Aldus Corp., and Boeing.andP;  Seattle is also a gateway tothe Pacific Rim.andP;  Maybe Washington isn't such a bad place for programmersafter all.andM;Evaluating your worth means evaluating current salary, regional variations,industry potential--all quantifiable data.andP;  But getting what you're worth ismore than looking at dollars and cents.andP;  Changing jobs in pursuit of a fewbucks may be fine for the short term, but for lasting career satisfaction andthe largest salaries, the key is to find your niche and love what you do.andM;ReferencesandM;[1_ Carlyle, Ralph Emmett.andP;
