The vote on the measure, sponsored by Sens. BennettJohnston (D., La.), and Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.), was 94-4.</LP><TEXT>   The bill is a stripped-down version of a measure thatfailed last year in the face of a filibuster led primarily byopponents of a provision to allow drilling in Alaska's ArcticNational Wildlife Refuge. Alaska's senators, Republicans TedStevens and Frank Murkowski, had pushed for a vote on thatissue this week but abandoned the effort when it became clearthe measure couldn't pass. Also dropped from last year's billwas a measure that would have forced auto makers to increasethe fuel efficiency of their fleets.   Energy Secretary James Watkins last night called themeasure &quot;tremendously powerful&quot; and said &quot;President Bush isextremely pleased with the way the bill came out.&quot; He toldreporters that the administration remains committed toopening up the wildlife refuge for development, butunderstood that such a provision couldn't be part of thislegislation.   The bill was also welcomed by David Blee, lobbyist for theNational Energy Coalition, an industry group seekingcomprehensive energy legislation. &quot;Sen. Johnston has managedto massage a bill out that still has some meat in it,&quot; Mr.Blee said.   Environmental groups generally contended that the measureis an improvement over the bill passed by the Senate EnergyCommittee, but that it still needs considerable work. Theywere delighted that the Alaska refuge provision was droppedand praised efforts to strengthen energy-efficiencyprovisions and increase environmental and consumer safeguardsin the utility section. But they remain opposed tonuclear-licensing provisions, among others, and insist thatthe bill gives away too much to energy industries.   &quot;If this bill were soup, you'd have to be careful eatingit because there are plenty of rocks and gravel among thecarrots and peas,&quot; said Leon Lowery, a lobbyist forEnvironmental Action. In the House, the Energy and CommerceCommittee this spring will take up a bill thatenvironmentalists generally prefer.   The utility provision, which would revise the PublicUtility Holding Company Act, gets mixed reviews from utilitycompanies. It was vigorously sought by nonutilitypower-generating companies, which stand to gain considerablebusiness in selling electric power to utilities. &quot;We'rethrilled. We think the Senate just said `yes' to competitionin electricity generation markets,&quot; said Merribel Ayres,executive director of the National Independent EnergyProducers.   The bill would allow utilities and nonutility companies tobuild, own and operate power plants in more than one statewithout having the facility subject to the regulations --including oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission-- that apply to utilities under the holding company act.While many major utilities supported the change, otherscontended that the new, unregulated entities might beunreliable.   The nuclear-plant licensing section would authorize theNuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a single operating andconstruction license for a new plant, rather than twolicenses as is now required. In debating the bill, lawmakersrejected an effort to increase public participation inlicensing decisions.   Among other provisions, the bill would:   -- Require car and truck fleets in cities of 250,000 ormore to begin operating on non-gasoline fuels, such asnatural gas and ethanol. The requirement, which would bephased in starting in 1995, generally would apply to fleetsof 20 or more vehicles.   -- Expedite the approval process for oil and natural-gaspipelines.   -- Force makers of lights and electric motors to increasethe energy efficiency of their products.</TEXT></DOC>
