The spokesman, Richard Weart, said these personnel had beenspecially selected ``to be alert for serious types of corruption.''   ``They are assigned to a district office or regional office orto the office of enforcement. But they are not directly assigned tointernal affairs,'' Weart said.   He said they are not paid extra for their role in monitoringother employees.   ``But if the situation arises they will report to a local officeof internal affairs on such matters,'' Weart said.   The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions that AssistantCustoms Commissioner for Internal Affairs William F. Green hadrecruited about 40 agency employees as field associates assigned tokey offices nationwide to ``keep their eyes and ears open for anywrongdoing'' among their colleagues.   The Post said the group was selected from among recruitstraining at the Federal Law Enforcement Academy at Glynco, Ga.   Weart acknowledged that the group had received additionaltraining for uncovering serious types of corruption, such as theftof cash or other evidence seized by the service. But he said theywere ``certainly not trained as spies.''   ``In our view, for an agency that is on the front line of druginterdiction we intend to hold our employees to a higherstandard,'' he said.   Weart said the approach of having employees act as informersagainst their co-workers was ``nothing new,'' explaining that thecode of conduct for federal employees required reporting wrongdoingby fellow workers.   He added that the program was modeled after a New York Citypolice department internal investigation headed by ex-officer FrankSerpico.   Recently two Customs inspectors were arrested in Hidalgo, Texas,on bribery charges and five agency workers were arrested in NewYork with airport and Agriculture Departmewnt workers ondrug-dealing charges.</TEXT></DOC>
