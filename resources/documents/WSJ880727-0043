Hudson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> PHA PUB </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The journal Nature set the world of science abuzz last month when it published an article by a French scientist it said it didn't believe.    Today, the same journal, after dispatching a fraud-busting team that included a scientist-cum-magician named James &quot;The Amazing&quot; Randi to inspect the French lab, debunks the work it just published as &quot;a delusion.&quot;    The bizarre episode pits the prestigious British publication against Jacques Benveniste, a French government scientist whose research purports to present the first genuine evidence in support of so-called homeopathic medicine.    Homeopaths believe that normally harmful potions can, when diluted millions of times, successfully treat a variety of ailments. Such remedies are a huge business in Europe, Mexico and elsewhere, but in most scientific circles they are dismissed as quackery.    Nature held its editorial nose last month when it published the research along with a disclaimer questioning the report's credibility. But the report's appearance in so respected a journal immediately stirred scientific controversy world-wide.    In today's issue, Nature devotes four pages to Mr. Benveniste's work, declaring: &quot;We conclude that there is no substantial basis&quot; for the French homeopathic claim. What's more, it expresses dismay at learning that a French homeopathic-drug company, Boiron et Cie., subsidized the original research. &quot;That is atrociously insulting,&quot; retorts Mr. Benveniste, noting that the lab's administrators had approved the Boiron subsidy.    The magazine dispatched three investigators -- including &quot;The Amazing&quot; Randi, a U.S. magician famed for uncovering scientific frauds -- to Mr. Benveniste's Paris lab at France's respected National Institute of Health and Medical Research.    Nature's team left no petri dish unturned in trying to find flaws in the scientist's experiments. The team took with it a video camera to record every detail of lab work. It mixed up lab vials, identifying each with a secret code. The Nature investigators then hid the code in an envelope taped to the lab's ceiling -- out of reach of Mr. Benveniste and his colleagues.    Nature wanted to make sure Mr. Benveniste and his colleagues were doing their experiments &quot;blind,&quot; without any inkling of the possible outcome. The original tests had monitored allergic reactions between human blood components and a watery solution of goat antibodies. The French team had diluted the antibody solution so many times that there couldn't have been any goat antibodies left to react with the blood, yet a reaction occurred nonetheless.    To Mr. Benveniste, the antibodies seemed to have left a ghost-like imprint on the water that remained even after the antibodies were gone. But to Nature's investigators, it seemed like sloppy lab work. When they repeated the tests with the special precautions, the sensational results evaporated.    Mr. Benveniste insists Nature's sleuths &quot;aren't fit for any scientific investigation.&quot; They weren't thorough enough and ignored corroborating evidence, he asserts.    &quot;The Amazing&quot; Randi even distracted the French researchers at a crucial point in their test by amusing them with magic tricks, according to Mr. Benveniste. Nature Editor John Maddox says Mr. Randi's spoon-bending stunts were aimed at defusing tension in the lab.    Mr. Benveniste says he plans to repeat his homeopathic experiments with new equipment. The Nature report &quot;is a plot&quot; to discredit his work, the French scientist fumes during a phone interview. &quot;Why on earth did Nature publish&quot; his research report June 30 &quot;to destroy it (today)? This is beyond my poor imagination,&quot; he says.    Nature, like most scientific journals, makes every effort to ensure the integrity of research, submitting papers to panels of outside experts for peer review. A four-person panel couldn't poke any holes in Mr. Benveniste's work, but Mr. Maddox says he refrained from publishing the article for more than two years. He finally did so only after the scientist rewrote the report and it leaked to the French press.    Although Nature keeps secret the identity of its original peer-review panel, Walter Stewart, a scientist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, acknowledges serving on both the peer-review panel and the investigatory team. He said he acquiesced in the paper's publication, despite initial reservations, thinking it contributed to &quot;free and open debate.&quot; But following the site visit to the Benveniste lab, &quot;a shocking lack of ordinary scientific controls&quot; was evident, Mr. Stewart said. The publication in Nature was &quot;an imposition on the scientific community,&quot; Mr. Stewart said he now believes.    Antoine Danchin, a gene researcher at Pasteur Institute in Paris, suggests Nature might have been seeking a splash with circulation-boosting news. Scientific publishing has become a big, profitable business, with growing rivalry between Nature and U.S. publications such as Science. Scientific publishers &quot;try to make sensations so they will have more money,&quot; he says. Nature's Mr. Maddox says the magazine doesn't need scoops to increase its circulation of 40,000.    The spat over Mr. Benveniste's research has the world's normally buttoned-down scientific community agog. &quot;Absolutely incredible,&quot; clucks Mr. Danchin.    ---   Marilyn Chase in San Francisco contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
