Toyota, which posted its first year-on-year drop in pretaxprofit in four years on both consolidated and unconsolidatedbases, warned that the down trend will continue for a while.</LP><TEXT>   The No. 1 Japanese car maker reported consolidated pretaxprofit fell 15% to 709.54 billion yen ($5.18 billion) from837.81 billion yen a year earlier. Net income fell 2.2% to431.45 billion yen from 441.30 billion yen. But sales grew7.2% to 9.855 trillion yen from 9.193 trillion yen.   Separately, Toyota said that it received 2.19 billion yenfrom Daiwa Securities Co. as compensation for losses insecurities trading but that it had no knowledge of thecompensation. In the loss-compensation scandal involvingJapan's Big Four and 17 other brokerage houses, Toyota toppedthe list of clients compensated by Daiwa Securities forsecurities losses between October 1987 and March 1990.   When the lists were disclosed at the end of July, Toyotastrongly denied any knowledge of receiving loss compensation.But a company investigation launched in July found thatcompensation was made in a deal between Daiwa Securities andDaiwa Investment Trust andamp; Management Co. Ltd., with whichToyota has a contract for discretionary managed funds.   The decision for Toyota to receive compensation was made&quot;without our knowledge,&quot; a company official said.   In announcing results, the company forecast a pinch forthis year. &quot;With capital investment growing, we aren'toptimistic about the results from the current fiscal year,&quot;said Shohei Kurihara, executive vice president.   He noted that such expenses cut into unconsolidatedoperating profit, which plunged 37% to 338.79 billion yenfrom 538.68 billion yen a year before. Factors contributingto the decline included a 65 billion yen increase in researchand development expenses, 60 billion yen in currency-exchangelosses and a 48 billion yen swelling in labor costs, Mr.Kurihara said. Increases in depreciation and other generalcosts also pushed down operating profit.   Most analysts said the earnings results were in line withtheir estimates, particularly in light of weak domesticdemand in Japan and the U.S. recession.   The parent company's domestic sales volume slipped 0.6% to2.45 million vehicles in the latest term, while exports rose3.9% to 1.67 million, because of growing demand in SoutheastAsia.   For the current fiscal year, Toyota targets domestic salesat 2.56 million vehicles and exports at 1.77 millionvehicles. The company expects unconsolidated sales of about 9trillion yen in the current fiscal year, with pretax profitremaining around the same level as in the previous year.</TEXT></DOC>
