YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/31/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Office of Government Ethics asked the Justice Department to look into whether Federal Home Loan Bank Board member Lee Henkel broke the law by proposing a rule that might have helped a thrift with which he had business dealings.    In a letter to Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.), Donald Campbell, deputy director of the ethics office, said, &quot;There is sufficient information . . . to warrant further investigation to determine if potential violations of (the law) exist. In view of the nature of the issues raised by our analysis of these matters, we have referred this case to the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice.&quot;    Specifically, Mr. Campbell cited the federal law that makes it a crime for a government official to participate &quot;personally and substantially . . . in a . . . matter in which, to his knowledge, he . . . has a financial interest.&quot; Violations of that law are punishable by a maximum fine of $10,000 and as many as two years in prison.    Mr. Henkel said in a statement, &quot;I am confident that the department's review will fully exonerate me . . . I urge the Department of Justice to conduct its review expeditiously so that I may fulfill my duties as a member of the Bank Board with my full attention.&quot;    At his first Bank Board meeting in December, Mr. Henkel proposed a rule that, according to agency officials, could have effectively immunized only two savings and loan institutions from any enforcement actions over their investments. The proposal died for lack of a second.    One of the thrifts was Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association in Irvine, Calif. Lincoln had made at least $61.9 million in loans to corporations and partnerships in which Mr. Henkel had an interest as well as a personal loan of more than $250,000 at two percentage points above the prime rate. The personal loan has been repaid.    Mr. Henkel has said he believed the proposal would have addressed an industrywide problem.    When he was appointed to the board, Mr. Henkel put all his business interests that had transactions with thrifts into a blind trust. He also agreed not to take part in any Bank Board votes involving thrifts with which he has dealt, including Lincoln.    Last month, Mr. Henkel didn't participate in the Bank Board's approval of a rule restricting the amount of equity investments that thrifts may make.    Mr. Henkel was appointed to the Bank Board Nov. 7, after the Senate adjourned without acting on his nomination, and he serves while awaiting confirmation. He was renominated in February, but confirmation hearings haven't been scheduled.    Sen. Proxmire, who opposes Mr. Henkel's confirmation, had requested investigations by the ethics office, the Justice Department and the Bank Board's inspector general.    The Justice Department told Mr. Proxmire in February that it had found no evidence of a conflict of interest in Mr. Henkel's proposal. Earlier this month, Harry Quillian, acting general counsel for the Bank Board, wrote an internal agency memorandum saying Mr. Henkel hadn't broken any Bank Board &quot;regulations, procedures or ethical standards.&quot;    Mr. Campbell, however, based his request for a Justice Department investigation on information in Mr. Quillian's report, which hasn't been made public.    Mr. Henkel, 58 years old, was Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service counsel during the Nixon administration. He later was a tax attorney and real estate developer in Atlanta. </TEXT></DOC>
