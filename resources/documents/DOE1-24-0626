The solution for a single inclusion is then used for determiningthe effective linear expansion coefficient of a medium containing manyspherically stratified inclusions and for estimating thermal stress concentrationsat inhomogeneities. The interaction between the inclusions is taken intoaccount by using the effective (self-consistent) field method. 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
