But federal Judge Kenneth Conboy said that local affiliates of the Boys Clubs, many of which already have changed their names to include the word &quot;Girls,&quot; are free to use the name.    Girls Clubs had filed suit last month in federal court in Manhattan, seeking to enjoin the name change. Girls Clubs alleged that the change would confuse the public and hamper fund-raising efforts. The temporary order applies until the suit is resolved.    Boys and girls can join Girls Clubs as well as Boys Clubs. </TEXT></DOC>
