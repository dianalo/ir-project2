We calculate the effectsof lens aberration on the focusing strength of the lens and on the dilutionof the beam's phase space density. From this we derive the minimum spotsize achievable using a cylindrically symmetric bi-Gaussian beam and,after inclusion of the beam-beam disruption effect, the luminosity enhancementthat can be gained in principle. We estimate the luminosity enhancementin the case of SLC design parameters and discuss limitations and possibleimprovements in plasma lens performance. Motivated by the need to reducethe background event rate due to beam-ion collisions, we discuss theoptics of the underdense plasma lens and introduce the concept of bootstrapdisruption. Possible use of the underdense plasma lens in a TLC-typecollider is examined. 14 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
