Multifoods has paid $30.75 a share for 1,751,000 shares ofMultifoods common stock previously owned by Bregman Partners and itsaffiliates, which last year indicated it might acquire up to 24.9percent of the company's stock.   Multifoods stock closed Wednesday at $30.62{, down 37{ cents ashare in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   Multifoods could repurchase up to 500,000 additional shares ofits common stock under a plan approved by the board of directors,the company said.   Bregman Partners never made a tender offer to acquire Multifoods,but it said more than a year ago in a filing with the Securities andExchange Commission that it intended to buy more than 24.9 percentof Multifoods' outstanding shares.   According to its most recent SEC filing, Bregman had purchasedonly 12.1 percent of the shares.   ``To the best of our knowledge we have purchased all of theirholdings,'' said Linda Berg, a Multifoods spokeswoman. ``You neverknew what their motives were.''   Bregman Partners, which includes the Belzberg banking family ofVancouver, British Columbia, could not be reached for comment. Theinvestment group earlier had suggested that Multifoods restructureits business but Multifoods Chairman Andre Gillette rejected theidea as a ``misleading and thinly disguised self-serving effort.''   In late July, the Canadian group proposed a restructuring inwhich Multifoods would sell its U.S. grain merchandising, MisterDonut chain and Canadian operations other than industrial andconsumer flour opeations to raise $120 million.   The partnership also proposed that the company borrow $270million and pay a special dividend of $28 in cash plus $6 in notesto the holders of its 14.6 million shares.   In rejecting the offer, Gillet proposed then to buy back thestock held by the partnership for $32 a share, the closing price ofthe stock on the previous day.   Multifoods, which nearly doubled its earnings from continuingoperations in fiscal 1988, has divested itself of its regionalconsumer food companies and flour mills in the United States in thepast three years. It also has acquired and consolidated companiesthat have given it a prominent position in the production anddistribution of food for the hospitality industry and vendingmachines.</TEXT></DOC>
