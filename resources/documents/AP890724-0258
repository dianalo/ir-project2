The stock market moved broadly lower from the opening bell andvarious market measures finished near their worst levels of thesession after an afternoon rebound ran out of steam.   Wall Street analysts had anticipated today's selloff.   Much of the force behind Friday's nearly 32-point surge in theDow Jones industrial average came from trading strategies tied tothe expiration of July stock-related futures and options.   With the conclusion of trading in those contracts, a majorbuying motivation disappeared.   ``A lot of last week's activity was predicated on the futuresand options expirations,'' said Eugene Peroni, director oftechnical research at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.   Attention now has returned to the interest rate outlook.Financial markets have been building up their hopes for the FederalReserve Board to make a significant move toward a more generouscredit policy but so far they have been disappointed.   ``The market must now consider that the Fed and the majorcommercial banks have not acted as aggressively as was hoped,''said Peroni.   Earlier this month when Chase Manhattan Bank cut its primelending rate to 10{ percent from 11 percent, it was widely assumedthat its competitors would follow suit. But other major banks havedemurred.   Peroni said he thinks the Fed will continue to ease its hold oncredit, but will do so in gradual, careful steps as it assesses theeconomy's condition.</TEXT></DOC>
