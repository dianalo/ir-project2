(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two governors praised a U.S. appeals courtruling upholding their right to veto National Guard trainingmissions. But the author of the law that had denied them thatauthority said the ruling was disturbing.   ``The court's decision restores the effective balance between thestate and federal governments with regard to authority over theNational Guard,'' Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, who had challengedthe law, said in a statement released by his office Tuesday.   Responding to Perpich's challenge, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals ruled 2-1 Tuesday that the law is unconstitutional.   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, whose state lost a similarchallenge in the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in October,called the ruling a ``victory for common sense, the Constitution andthe governors of the United States.''   But Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., who wrote theso-called Montgomery Amendment taking away governors' control overGuard units, said the ruling could hamper the Guard's effectiveness.   ``If 50 governors are allowed to veto Guard missions because theydon't like the way our foreign policy is administered, it would havean adverse impact on training and would raise questions about theavailability of the Guard to meet its considerable defenseresponsibilities,'' he said.   Because the decision conflicted with the 1st Circuit's previousruling, the matter may have to be decided by the Supreme Court. Inthe meantime, federal officials said, the ruling will notimmediately affect Guard training.   Perpich and Dukakis said Tuesday's ruling reaffirmsconstitutionally guaranteed states' rights. Ohio, Colorado, Vermontand Maine also supported the Minnesota lawsuit.   ``The Montgomery Amendment went too far in tipping the balance ofpower toward the federal government,'' said Perpich, who wasvacationing in Hawaii.   Dukakis, the unsuccessful Democratic presidential nominee, alsocriticized what he said was the Reagan administration's policy ofusing Guard troops in Central America to destabilize Nicaragua'sleftist Sandinista regime. ``That policy has been a failure,'' hesaid in Boston.   His state's effort to block the use of Massachusetts Guard unitsin Central America was criticized by Vice President George Bushduring the presidential campaign.   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said his state nowis more likely to appeal the ruling in its case.   The 8th Circuit majority concluded that the Montgomery Amendmentcontravenes the intent of the framers of the U.S. Constitution, whothey said designed the militia _ now the National Guard _ ``to serveas a check on the potential abuse of military power by the federalgovernment.''   ``The government has not demonstrated that the effectiveness ofeither the national defense or the National Guard will be diminishedby adherence to the constitutional principle of basic state controlover National Guard forces, absent a declaration of war or nationalexigency,'' the majority said in an 80-page opinion.   The ruling reversed an August 1987 decision by U.S. DistrictJudge Donald Alsop of Minnesota.   Amy Brown, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice inWashington, said the ruling only affects states in the 8th Circuit:Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota andSouth Dakota. The ruling does not take effect immediately, she said,and probably would be put on hold if the government appeals.   Dan Donohue, a spokesman for the National Guard Bureau inWashington, suggested further legal action is likely because of theconflicting appeals court decisions. ``But no decisions have beenmade officially on an appeal,'' he said.   ``The Montgomery Amendment is still the law of the land except inthe affected case,'' Donohue said.``We will continue to deploy andtrain soldiers in accordance with the federal law.''   Nationally, about 115,000 men and women serve in the Air NationalGuard and an additional 460,000 serve in the Army National Guard,Donohue said.   The Pentagon is planning to send about 6,000 Guard members fromacross the country to Honduras during 1989 for road-building andengineering exercises, Donohue said.</TEXT></DOC>
