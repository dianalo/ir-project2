Q: So, basically you would try to put it off until _   A: Well, I don't _ I don't attempt _ I don't expect other than avery broad way this _ these questions to arise because we have asummit set to address ourselves to those. Yeah?   Q: Daniel Ortega was supposed to decide today whether to end thecease-fire. If he does in fact end the cease-fire, are you preparedwith some sort of response?   A: Well, as I said down there, I'm not going to go into thathypothetical situation at this time. But I'll tell you, I've neverseen a meeting where all the participants were so united againstthe outrages of one, I mean _ and we're still getting messages inabout the outrageous performance of Daniel Ortega _ reached a newembarrasing proportions stepping on it.   Q: Is renewed military aid to the Contras though, still a viableoption now? Is that something you could consider if needed?   A: Well, I am not _ as I indicated down there, I wouldre-evaluate the situation in a minute if this cease-fire is broken.Yeah?   Q: Mr. President, were you upset at all by Secretary of StateBaker's _ (inaudible) _ Soviet policy _ (inaudible) _   A: I've discussed this matter with Mr. Baker, and Mr. Gates, andMr. Scowcroft, even discussed it with Marlin Fitzwater _ (laughter)_ don't say I don't reach out _ (laughter) _ and John, and youknow, these stories, who's up, who's down, who's winning, who'snot, who's going to be a hardline, we've got a good, strong teamcoping with these problems, and you _ the degree in which Bob Gatesand the Secretary of State are together, and Brent and John Sununu.Why, it's _ we've been very lucky. And so, I don't get allexercised about that kind of thing. I know everybody else doesaround here, but I don't. It's just _   Q: _ he acknowledged that he stopped Gates _   A: Well, I _   Q: _ from giving a hardline speech.   A: It wasn't a ``hardline'' speech and he didn't say that. Andmaybe now we'll understand a little more of what's happening outthere as a result of what I'm talking to you today about. Rightthere.   Q: On a related question, Vice President Quayle has taken a veryhardline position, and that doesn't _ is he out of sync?   A: No! He's totally in sync. And I had a chance to discuss thiswith one of the outstanding reporters for the New York Times theother day, who had a feeling he was ``out of sync.'' And he isn't!And I just _ you know, everybody's looking for nuances. And that'sfine, that's your business. But I think we've been blessed in thisadministration by _ the president can sit in _ by this, thepresident can sit in there and get conflicting ideas and then wedon't have to go out and sound like there's disarray. So when somesee one statement that may sound a little different, then I canunderstand running with that ball, because I know how this placeworks. But that's _ the main thing is I feel that we are togetheron these issues. And that goes for the vice president and thesecretary of state and my very able national security team. So Idon't sense this, you know, one being tugged one way or tuggedanother. Huh?   Q: Mr. President _   A: Helen, you had three questions. Get at it. (Laughter.)   Q: (Inaudible.)   A: I hadn't thought about that.   Q: Mr. President, on the environment _ another summit _ you havepeople _   A: That will come up with Mr. Gorbachev.   Q: Well, so I thought. You have people _   A: I think.   Q: _ going to the Netherlands next week who some say are(inaudible) to go without an agenda. It looks like the UnitedStates is not going to play a leadership role on global warming,though you promised that during your campaign.   A: We will play a leadership role in global warming, and it'llbe based on the finest, most up-to-date science possible. And wewill fulfill that role. And I think most countries, in spite ofwhere they are on some conference, look to the United States forthat kind of leadership in science. And we will _ we will fulfillit. So _ and you see both our national _ our science adviser andthe head of the EPA, in sync, going over there. I think that'sgood. Saul?   Q: He already had one!   A: He had one before?   Reporters: Yeah!   A: I de-recognize him. OK, back here. (Laughter.)   Q: Mr. President _   Q: You're at a near conflict with Congress on capital gains.What are you prepared to do about that? And will you accept a fullyear of sequestration in lieu of that?      MORE:</TEXT></DOC>
