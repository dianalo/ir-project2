President Haruo Yamaguchi signed a research and development agreement to expand cooperation in the computer and telecommunications fields.    Mr. Mosbacher said the agreement &quot;allows both Japan and the U.S. to enrich their technical capability without duplicating basic research in costly and time-consuming areas.&quot;    The accord, an expansion of an arrangement dating to 1984 between NTT and the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, is expected to extend cooperative development in certain fields touching on semiconductors, telecommunications, computers, computer networking and frequency measurements.    The agreement calls for information exchange on various scientific and technical developments, visits and technical consultations between Commerce Department and NTT staff members and exchanges of scientists, engineers and other specialists for up to 12 months at each other's laboratories. It also calls for joint research activities on tests, experiments and other technical projects.    The agreement leaves open the possibility of further cooperation in mutually agreed areas. </TEXT></DOC>
