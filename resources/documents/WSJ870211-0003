Wimberly, chief operating officer, will become president and chief executive officer next month, when Hanson Trust PLC completes its planned acquisition of the cement concern.    Mr. Wimberly, 41 years old, will succeed Walter E. Ousterman Jr., 56, in both posts. Mr. Ousterman, who is retiring, also will step down as chairman when Kaiser becomes a unit of the London-based conglomerate; after the acquisition, Kaiser no longer will have a separate board.    Mr. Ousterman couldn't be reached for comment. A Kaiser spokesman characterized Mr. Ousterman's decision to end his 30-year career with the company as voluntary and amicable, noting that the executive was instrumental in structuring the planned merger. A successor hasn't been named for the chief operating officer post at Kaiser.    As previously reported, Hanson's U.S. unit, Iselin, N.J.-based Hanson Industries Inc., next month will complete its $27.50-a-share, or about $200 million, friendly acquisition of Kaiser Cement. </TEXT></DOC>
