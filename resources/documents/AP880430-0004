U.S. officials confirmed Friday that Noriega agreed duringnegotiations with the Reagan administration to step down ascommander of the Defense Forces but that he had rejected U.S.efforts to persuade him to leave the country immediately afterresigning.   The Washington Post said Noriega is expected to step down in amatter of weeks and would prefer to live in the Dominican Republicif he is forced into exile.   Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a leader of the anti-Noriegaforces in Washington, reacted sharply to word of the proposedagreement. He accused the United States of going beyond itsauthority in trying to negotiate Panama's political future.   That issue, he said in an interview, ``has to be negotiated byPanamanians.''   He said Noriega, by remaining in Panama, would be able to``wield his considerable influence'' because of the manyPanamanians in the Defense Forces and in other key positions whoare loyal to him.   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, acknowledged that thearrangement was ``less than ideal'' because it does not contemplateNoriega's short-term departure from Panama.   Sosa has remained on as Panama's ambassador to the UnitedStates, refusing to relinquish the embassy to a replacement envoynamed by Panamanian President Manuel Solis Palma.   Sosa and the United States share the view that President EricArturo Delvalle, deposed on Feb. 26 by Noriega's supporters,continues to be the legitimate authority in Panama.   In Miami, Roberto Eisenmann, exiled publisher of the closedindependent newspaper La Prensa, said: ``This sounds like asurrender with cosmetics. This is the same mistake all over again _the United States intervening in Panama, ignoring totally thepolitical forces of the country.''   Gilberto Mallol, Miami representative of the Panamanianopposition umbrella group, the Civic Crusade, agreed.   ``This cosmetic solution will only take the country down theroad to disaster,'' said Mallol. ``The Reagan administration has noright to decide Noriega can remain in Panama.''   Mallol disputed U.S. contentions that Noriega will be out ofpower as soon as he is out of uniform. ``Obviously, this deal showsNoriega is making conditions. He will continue to interfere andcontinue the militarization of Panama.''   Mallol warned that the deal could backfire on the United States,causing a wave of anti-American sentiment among Noriega opponents.   The administration has been seeking Noriega's ouster since hewas indicted in early February on drug smuggling charges by twoFlorida grand juries.   Spain has offered to give Noriega political asylum and, as aninducement to him, the administration has said it would make noeffort to extradite him if he accepted the Spanish bid.   The administration has refused to recognize Panama's 2-month-oldgovernment and has frozen Panamanian government assets in theUnited States, among other measures. These steps have contributedto the collapse of the Panamanian economy.</TEXT></DOC>
