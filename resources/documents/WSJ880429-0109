A subway-car advertisement in 1986 featured 22 samurai grouped around a scholarly Westerner holding a floppy disk. The underlying message: Lotus will revolutionize the Japanese businessman's life just as westernization did the samurai's life in the 1860s.    Two years later, Lotus is proving its point. The Japanese version of its Lotus 1-2-3 was Japan's best-selling microcomputer program last year, according to a trade magazine. Lotus's 1988 sales in Japan through March were more than half of its total 1987 sales here. Japan is now Lotus's third-largest market after the U.S. and Britain.    To affirm its newfound love for Japan, Lotus held a board meeting in Tokyo this week. &quot;It's a demonstration of the importance of the market,&quot; says Lotus Chairman Jim Manzi. &quot;We'll be here until the end of time. We'd be crazy not to.&quot;    Lotus's success shows how a U.S. company with a competitive product in an industry the U.S. still leads can thrive in Japan in a very short time. Lotus's timing was perfect. Companies here are just starting in earnest to seek alternatives to the pocket calculators and hand-written ledgers that still dominate Japan's offices.    &quot;Everyone was getting thirsty,&quot; says Tetsuya Goto, accounts manager at giant Tokio Marine andamp; Fire Insurance Co., a big Lotus 1-2-3 user. &quot;Lotus served up the water and their water was sweet. So everyone's ordering up more.&quot;    Lotus eagerly serves it up. It sells five Japanese versions of its Lotus 1-2-3 program -- which combines calculation, graph-making, and data-base functions -- for four Japanese computer makes. (Many rivals run on only one make.) Lotus plans a Japanese 1-2-3 for mainframes and later this year will start Japanese sales of its CDROMs, compact disks storing vast amounts of computer data.    Lotus won't release exact figures, but Mr. Manzi says 1987 sales here were about $10 million. Although the figure represents a very small percentage of Lotus's overall sales last year of $395.6 million, Japanese sales are booming. Sales in the first quarter of 1988 were 650 million yen, just more than $5 million. Japan &quot;will be our fastest-growing major market overseas next year,&quot; says Mr. Manzi. &quot;We want to become a much, much larger entity.&quot;    Lotus also is serving up more of its sprightly ads. A current business-magazine ad plays on managers' growing insecurity over Japan's decidedly un-automated offices and on their penchant for comparing themselves with Westerners. Roughly translated, it declares: &quot;If you're still punching a calculator you aren't considered a professional. Not in America.&quot;    Lotus gets away with such jibes now, but it was the Japanese industry that snickered when Lotus sent two executives here in 1984 to scout out the market. Snickers broke into guffaws when Lotus declared that it would aim at the best-seller spot in Japan that it enjoyed elsewhere with Lotus 1-2-3.    The program was old technology and Lotus was too late behind archrival Microsoft Corp., detractors said, and Japanese simply don't make decisions on computers like Westerners do. &quot;Most everyone was very skeptical,&quot; says Bill Smale, president of Smale/Brooks Ventures, a Tokyo software consultant. &quot;Perhaps 20% thought they would do well.&quot;    Lotus ignored conventional wisdom, forming a wholly owned subsidiary, Lotus Development Japan Ltd., instead of selling through a local distributor. Rather than farm out the task of translating the software into Japanese -- a complex process requiring modified computer codes -- it hired engineers from a Japanese software house and had them share the work with counterparts in Britain and the U.S.    Lotus sent in an American marketing manager who, fluent in Japanese, canvassed potential users to get ideas for the program and to spread the Lotus name. And the company hired away a Sony Corp. marketing whiz, Saburo Kikuchi, as its president in Japan.    By early 1986, Lotus had a Japanese translation of Lotus 1-2-3 that the American engineers wanted to sell. But the Japanese engineers said it wasn't good enough. So Lotus spent another six months adding features Japanese users wanted, such as lines printed between numbers and special graphs. By September 1986 when the first program came out, Lotus had spent close to $5 million getting ready.    Meanwhile, Lotus used marketing schemes few rivals did. It persuaded Japanese publishers to put out 60 Lotus 1-2-3 guidebooks. It gave prototype programs to companies before development was finished; many came back for more. Tokio Marine ordered 1,500 packages even before the version they wanted went on sale. Nissan Motor Co., Bank of Tokyo, Esso Sekiyu K.K. and others have bought 80,000 Lotus 1-2-3 programs since its introduction.    The program isn't perfect. Users complain that the graphics, for example, aren't up to Japanese standards.    Still, the high-profile demand makes computer vendors such as IBM Japan and NEC Corp. eager to sell Lotus 1-2-3 with their machines. And that support woos more risk-shy Japanese buyers to Lotus. &quot;Our biggest worry is that a software supplier will disappear, but now that obviously won't happen with Lotus,&quot; says Mr. Goto of Tokio Marine. &quot;There's no reason why something that's good for America and Europe can't be good for Japan. We understand that now.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
