The captors, who call themselves the Revolutionary JusticeOrganization, said they would give Israel several days to meet new,tougher conditions but did not say what would happen if theIsraelis refused.   When the original threat to kill Cicippio was made Monday, hiscaptors demanded the release of a Shiite Moslem cleric abducted byIsraeli commandos July 28. The new terms include release ofunspecified ``Palestinian and Lebanese'' guerrillas.   Israel has offered to trade Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, 33, andother Lebanese Shiites it holds for Western hostages and threeIsraeli soldiers held prisoner in Lebanon. Obeid is a spiritualleader of Hezbollah, or Party of God, an Iranian-sponsored groupthought to be behind the kidnappings.   In Jerusalem, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel wouldexamine the new demands ``on a positive basis.'' He would notelaborate.   Sheik Na'im Qassem, a Hezbollah leader, said there had been nodirect or indirect negotiations with Israel on a prisoner exchangeand would not be.   After learning of the reprieve, Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Elham,told The Associated Press by telephone: ``I am very happy. I neverlost hope. I hope this part of the ordeal is all over.''   A short, written statement from the White House said in part:``We regard this as an encouraging and hopeful development. But itstill does not answer our continuing concern for release of allhostages. ... We express our appreciation to all those who havebeen thus far trying to help.''   The latest word about Cicippio came in a handwritten statementfrom the Revolutionary Justice Organization delivered to a Westernnews agency 45 minutes before the deadline of 10 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT)it had set for killing him.   It was the third time the group held off on its threat to killCicippio.   A photograph of the 58-year-old captive from the waist up, withthe trace of a smile on his face, accompanied the Arabic-languagestatement.   ``Out of respect for the intervention by the parties and stateswith whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, wedeclare the freezing of the death sentence and its subsitution withan initiative,'' the captors' statement said.   None of the mediating nations was named, but press reports inBeirut have said Iran, Syria and Algeria were believed to haveinterceded.   In addition to Obeid, the latest demands said Israel must freePalestinian and Lebanese guerrillas, whose names the kidnapperssaid they would provide to the Red Cross.   ``Acceptance should be announced within days, otherwise theinitiative will be considered canceled,'' the statement said,without explaining what was meant.   Revolutionary Justice stated its intentions with similarvagueness last year and in 1987 when it allowed death threatsagainst Cicippio, another American hostage and a French captive tofade.   Earlier Thursday, Cicippio's captors had announced a four-hourpostponement of the death deadline and released a videotape inwhich he read a statement asking Israel to free Obeid.   On Monday, the captors of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins said theyhad hanged him in retaliation for Obeid's abduction. The U.S.Marine officer was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988, while on U.N. duty insouthern Lebanon.   Several reports have said Higgins was killed months ago. OnThursday, the Israeli Defense Ministry said Obeid toldinterrogators Higgins was alive last week, but Israel has said itreceived word of his death long ago.   Other than Higgins, 16 Westerners are missing and assumedcaptive in Lebanon, including eight Americans. Held longest isTerry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Hashemi Rafsanjani, known as a pragmatist, was sworn in Thursdayas president of Iran. He made no comment about the hostages andthere was no indication what role, if any, he played in thedecision about Cicippio.   The Tehran Times said other countries should follow the French,who ``succeeded in winning release of their hostages in Beirutbecause they made an honorable deal.''   All French hostages in Lebanon were released in 1987, butdetails of the agreement were not revealed. Rafsanjani has tiedusing Iran's ``good will'' to free Americans to the release ofIranian assets frozen by the United States.   On two occasions in 1988, Revolutionary Justice made deaththreats against Cicippio and another American, Edward Austin Tracy,58, a writer kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986, but did not carry them out.   In March 1987, the kidnappers said they would kill Frenchhostage Jean-Louis Normandin unless France suspended arms sales toIraq, with which Iran was at war. They canceled the death threatafter three postponements covering nearly two weeks, and Normandinwas freed in November of that year.   On the videotape, also delivered to a Western news agency,Cicippio said: ``I appeal to each person having honor who can moveto release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, don't be late because they arevery serious to hang us and the period become very soon and thehours very little.''   He had a bushy beard and was shown from the waist up readingfrom a statement. The poor English suggested it was written by hiscaptors.   Cicippio wore glasses, was dressed in a blue track suit andappeared haggard and distressed.   ``My dear wife and people and all the human society andespecially the Red Cross, don't leave me,'' he said. ``So to helpme move I demand from the American people to oblige Israel torelease Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid immediately because his kidnappingis not human.   ``We the American people are always the victims of Israel'spolitics and President Bush has not helped to free us,'' saidCicippio, who was acting comptroller of the American University ofBeirut when he was abducted Sept. 12, 1986.   His voice broke with emotion when he ended the appeal with thismessage for his Lebanese wife, Elham Ghandour, a secretary at theU.S. Embassy in Beirut:   ``Goodbye, my wife. If you don't hear my voice and see my faceagain, I want you to look after yourself, and don't be sad, andalways remember me.''   Marrack Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeepingoperations, met in Beirut on Thursday with Shiite leaders andIranian Embassy personnel.   ``I still do not know whether Col. Higgins is dead,'' he said.``But if he is dead, I hope that whoever is holding his body willmake it available so it can be returned to his family for a decentburial in his home country.''   Higgins' kidnappers called themselves the Organization of theOppressed on Earth.   Ad-Diyar, a conservative Beirut newspaper, said Iran had toldthe United States delivery of the body was conditional on Obeid'srelease. Iran's official news agency described the report as``baseless allegations.''</TEXT></DOC>
