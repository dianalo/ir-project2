Everett Koop criticized U.S.tobacco marketing at home and abroad Wednesday, backing a bill tokeep cigarette machines away from minors and declaring America isnot respected overseas ``because of the manner in which we exportdisease and death.''   Koop said the epithet ``ugly American'' will ``indeed come hometo roost in a decade or two when the developing countries of todayrealize what we did to them.''   He said the wide availability of cigarette vending machines inthe United States makes a mockery of laws forbidding minors to buycigarettes.   ``Would we tolerate the sale of alcoholic beverages throughvending machines?'' he asked. ``Would we allow free samples ofalcoholic beverages to be sent through the mail or passed out onpublic property? Of course not.''   Koop, in what he said would be his last appearance as surgeongeneral on Capitol Hill, testified at a House subcommittee hearingcalled by anti-smoking activists in Congress.   He supported a bill sponsored by Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, thatwould forbid the placement of cigarette vending machines in anylocation accessible to people under 18.   During the hearing, Reps. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., and Luken bothtook aim at possible Bush administration action against Thailand'sban on tobacco advertising, comparing the case to the British EastIndia Co.'s efforts to develop Asian opium markets in the 1800s.   Luken is pushing in particular for more restrictions on tobaccoadvertising in this country, while Atkins wants to make itimpossible for the United States to challenge any other country'slimits on the sale of American cigarettes.   Along with Koop and other members of Congress, they are scheduledto testify next week at a U.S. Trade Representative hearing intowhether Thailand's tobacco ad ban is an unfair trading practice.   The Tobacco Institute said the industry has pressed the U.S.government to make it easier to sell in Korea, Japan, Thailand andother countries _ but only to give the U.S. industry a fair shot atthe existing market for cigarettes.   ``Wherever market barriers exist in foreign countries, it is andshould be our government's policy to eliminate them and promotetrade throughout the world,'' Tobacco Institute spokesman Charles O.Whitley told the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on transportationand hazardous materials.   As for U.S. sales, Koop, who is retiring this month as thenation's health policy chief, spoke in favor of a provision inLuken's bill that would restrict vending-machine cigarette sales.   He said the machines give youngsters easy access to tobacco andsend a message that this country isn't worried that they will becomeaddicted.   ``There is no logical reason why we should have a double standardfor controlling the sale of tobacco and alcohol, the two major legaladdicting drugs used in our society,'' Koop said.   At a previous hearing on Luken's bill, the Tobacco Institute,citing a report by a vending machine trade organization, theNational Automatic Merchandising Association, said only 2{ percentof teen-age smokers bought their cigarettes from machines.   Whitley told the panel, ``Most cigarette vending machines arelocated in factories, offices and other establishments that are notopen to the public or generally are not frequented by persons under18.''   But Koop said, ``Even if true, and I'm not convinced it is, it'sa poor argument against banning vending machine sales of cigarettes.... Even 20 percent of the 374,000 vending machines in the UnitedStates represents a huge number of sites from which teen-agers canreadily obtain cigarettes, illegally.''</TEXT></DOC>
