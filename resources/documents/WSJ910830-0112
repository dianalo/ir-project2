The penalty settlement was the first large one under a newschedule of fines enacted by Congress last November,involving a sevenfold increase in allowable penalties. Citgoagreed to the settlement with the department's OccupationalSafety and Health Administration without admitting anywrongdoing. OSHA had proposed an $8.2 million fine againstCitgo for 41 alleged violations. Citgo, based in Tulsa,Okla., is a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., theVenezuelan state-owned oil company.</LP><TEXT>   The previous OSHA record for penalties imposed on anemployer was set last week, when Phillips Petroleum Co.agreed to pay $4 million to settle charges related toexplosions that killed 23 workers at a chemical plant outsideHouston in October 1989.   The Citgo agreement was part of a new OSHA crackdown onunsafe practices in the petrochemical and petroleumindustries, following numerous fires and explosions in recentyears. Citgo also agreed to begin a companywidehazard-abatement program, extending beyond the Lake Charlessite to refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Paulsboro,N.J.   Under that program, Citgo will launch a more rigoroussafety effort. This would entail a systematic approach foridentifying and controlling production processes for highlyhazardous materials, which OSHA has also been pushingpetrochemical companies to adopt.   In Tulsa, Citgo said it settled with OSHA to allow thecompany &quot;to focus all of its attention and resources onenhancing the safety of its workplaces, as well as avoidingcostly and lengthy litigation.&quot;   The company said it &quot;denies the allegations in OSHA'scitations and that it violated any laws, regulations orsafety standards.   &quot;We at Citgo regret this tragic accident, and we continueto work with the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration to further enhance safety,&quot; said Ron Hall,Citgo president and chief executive officer. &quot;Citgo isunalterably committed to operating the safest refineries inthe country for our employees and contractors, and theprevention of this type of accident from ever happeningagain.&quot;   The companywide plan will cover 6,000 workers at Citgorefineries.   Finally, Citgo agreed to a new safety approach: it willpay $200,000, as part of the $6 million settlement, to thegovernment's National Institute for Occupational Safety andHealth to help start a training program for oil andpetrochemical workers.   The Lake Charles accident occurred when a catalyticcracking unit was being brought back on line after aseven-week maintenance closure, OSHA said. During thestartup, a drainage valve at the bottom of a pressure vesselwas improperly closed, letting water accumulate in thevessel.   When superheated oil was allowed into the vessel and mixedwith the water, a steam explosion resulted, rupturing thevessel. The oil ignited, and a fire engulfed the unit, OSHAsaid.   The regulatory agency cited Citgo for failing to protectemployees from fire and explosion hazards, failing to traininspection personnel properly for pressure vessels andinstalling undersized relief valves on catalytic crackingunits. The company was also cited for failing to meet OSHAregulations for training personnel in emergency responseoperations and failing to train employees on fire brigade atleast once a year.   Other citations included shortcomings in anemergency-response plan, such as failure to specify safedistances and places of refuge and lack of a plant emergencyalarm system; inadequate maintenance and inspection offirefighting equipment; and violations of standards for exitsfrom buildings, pipe protection, electric equipment andfueling operations.</TEXT></DOC>
