Health authorities threw parties for the nation's first babies born free on July 5, 1948, the day the post-World War II Labor Party government's system of socialized medicine took effect.    Politicians went head on in angry exchanges in Parliament. Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, shouting above opposition jeers, denied she is bent on dismantling the cornerstone of the welfare state. Her government, she said, adheres to the principle that &quot;all people should have access to the best possible treatment regardless of their ability to pay.&quot;    Labor lawmakers recalled with pride the day that a socialist dream was realized with the setting up by Health Minister Aneurin Bevan of a service designed to give free health care to every Briton, rich or poor.    &quot;The National Health Service is the socialism that people want and understand,&quot; Labor Party deputy leader Roy Hattersley told an anniversary rally in Glasgow, Scotland. &quot;The idea of the Health Service is so strong that its popularity has been sustained through a decade of Thatcherite philosophy dominated by greed, selfishness, every-man-for-himself and devil-take-the-hindmost.&quot;    Health workers delivered giant birthday cards to Mrs. Thatcher's 10 Downing Street residence to honor the service.    Doctors who pioneered the system recalled how its birth ended the fear of being ill and unable to pay. &quot;I remember the patients I had tried to visit at home who might not answer the door because a young doctor's visit wasn't worth the cost they could ill afford,&quot; said Sir Anthony Alment, who went on to become president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.    From costing about $1 billion in 1949, the National Health Service bill now is $41 billion a year. It narrowly outstrips defense spending and is the second-biggest item of state spending, behind social security. With 1.2 million staff from cleaners to brain surgeons, the service is also the biggest employer in Western Europe. It provides treatment from flu shots to heart transplants for a million patients a year. Only 10% of Britons choose private treatment.    Despite soaring expenditures, the waiting list for hospital beds is about 700,000. There are periodic national furors, such as last winter when a child died after a long wait for heart surgery at a Birmingham hospital.    The health service has been a sensitive topic for Mrs. Thatcher since she came to power in 1979. She regularly reels off statistics showing that health spending has risen by nearly one-third since she took office. But a common perception of cuts by the Conservatives remains. An all-party parliamentary committee yesterday added its voice to widespread complaints of underfunding, urging an immediate $1.7 billion increase.    Mrs. Thatcher has ordered a wide-ranging review of the health service, the results of which are due to be released this autumn. The move, and ideas being bandied about, such as hospital-stay charges and tax breaks for private health insurance, have increased suspicions that she is aiming to reduce state health care to a secondrate system for the poorest.    Britain spends less than most other Western democracies on health -- about 6% of its gross national product, compared with 10.5% on the mainly private U.S. system and 9.2% in West Germany.    The Conservative government argues that the figures are a tribute to the efficiency of the British system. The British Medical Association, the doctors' main professional body, disagrees.    &quot;There is, in our view, a major crisis in the health service,&quot; association chairman John Marks said this week, urging the government to spend an extra $2.55 billion. &quot;The government, of course, maintains there is no such crisis. Most of us, like most of our patients, prefer the evidence of our own eyes.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
