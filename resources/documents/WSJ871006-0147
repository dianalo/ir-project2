In a survey of its members, the group concluded that the nation's inflation-adjusted output, or real gross national product, will expand 2.7% next year following a 3% increase this year. But a majority of the economists -- 56% -- said they expect a recession to begin in 1989.    The economists' optimism for next year seems to be based partly on a belief that the new Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, won't allow a recession to occur during an election year. When asked about differences between Mr. Greenspan and his predecessor, Paul Volcker, 46% of the economists said they expect Mr. Greenspan to be more willing &quot;to defer to White House influence on the setting of monetary policy.&quot;    The results of the survey were released at the economists' annual meeting here.    The anticipated growth through this year and next will result largely from reduction in the trade deficit, the survey said. The economists predicted the deficit would narrow to $140 billion in 1988 from a projected $155 billion this year. &quot;As far as the respondents of our survey are concerned,&quot; said the group's president, Jerry Jordan, &quot;we have seen the worst of the trade deficit.&quot;    The group, which is made up largely of corporate economists, was much more pessimistic in its outlook for inflation. The economists projected that prices will increase 4.5% this year and 4.8% next year. That is significantly higher than the forecast the same group made a year ago, when they expected consumer prices to rise only 3.7% this year. For the first eight months of this year, consumer prices have risen at a 5.1% annual rate. They rose 1.1% last year.    Interest rates are expected to follow inflation, the economists said, with the prime rate moving to 9.1% at the end of next year. Currently the prime rate -- which is used by banks as a base rate on a wide range of loans to medium-size and small businesses as well as to individuals -- is 8.75%.    Many of the business economists -- 44% -- said they felt it would be &quot;desirable&quot; for the dollar's foreign exchange value to fall further. A majority predicted the dollar would fall 10% to 30% over the next four years.    When asked what steps they would prefer to reduce the federal budget deficit, 65% of the economists said they would support cuts in defense spending. </TEXT></DOC>
