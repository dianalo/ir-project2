Fifty percent of the union leaders and 38 percent of thebusiness leaders surveyed in a recent study commissioned byMetropolitan Life Insurance Co. said employee payments for healthinsurance would be one of the top six negotiating priorities forthis year.   ``Health care has been a major issue on the bargaining table andas we progress into the '90s, it will become the No. 1 or No. 2issue,'' Lorrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for the AFL-CIO inWashington, said Friday.   ``It certainly does seem to be a trend that will be a majorfocal point with the rate health care costs are growing,'' saidKaren Brigham of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States.   Health insurance has been the principal bargaining issue in thecontract talks among the seven ``Baby Bells'' and the unions thatrepresent their more than 300,000 workers.   Workers at NYNEX Corp., Bell Atlantic Corp. and Pacific Telesiswent on strike last week, and workers struck Ameritech on Sunday.   Workers and company officials reached agreement at BellSouth,Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. and U S West. In the latter two,strikes were averted when the companies agreed to surrender theirdemands that workers pay a share of health insurance premiums,which up to now had been 100 percent company paid.   Earlier this year, ATandamp;T averted a threatened strike byabandoning demands that workers pay a share of health premiums.   Ms. Brigham said health care costs have been rising at more thantwice the rate of inflation in the past few years.   ``Employers realize they cannot absorb these increases yearafter year and remain competitive,'' she said. ``Part of thesolution is to inject a little more individual responsibility intothe picture.''   Ms. McHugh agreed on the need to get health care costs undercontrol but disagreed on the solution.   ``We recognize the fact that as health care costs continue toescalate, there needs to be an equitable solution, but if youcontinue to shift the burden, you create barriers to care for manyworking Americans,'' she said.   The AFL-CIO's preferred solution, she said, is a national healthinsurance plan. She said the umbrella labor organization will starta campaign in November for an overhaul of the nation's health caresystem.   Myles Calvey, business manager of the Quincy, Mass.-based Local2222 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, saidNYNEX was profitable enough to be able to pay its workers' healthinsurance coverage.   But Peter Cronin, a spokesman for New England Telephone, adivision of NYNEX, said the company would be unusual if itcontinued providing full health insurance coverage at no cost tothe workers.   ``The way things have developed because of the high costs ofmedical care, about 80 percent of the businesses in the countryrequire some kind of co-payment. The unusual thing is we have beenable to continue full payment as long as we have,'' Cronin said.</TEXT></DOC>
