In addition, Great American, based in San Diego, reporteda net loss of $1.2 million, or five cents a share, for thefirst quarter, compared with profit of $11 million, or 45cents a share, a year earlier.</LP><TEXT>   Great American, the nation's eighth-largest thrift with$15.4 billion in assets, said federal thrift examiners havequestioned how it values certain of its loans, real estateand other assets, and that the assumptions being used byregulators would reduce its assets by at least $65 million.   The company defended its own assumptions, and saiddiscussions are continuing as the regulators complete theirexam. It added that it didn't know whether it would berequired to incur write-downs, and that &quot;the potential losswhich may be required to be reported cannot reasonably beestimated at this time.&quot; Any impact would likely be reflectedin results for the second quarter, the company said.   A write-down of $65 million would eliminate about half ofthe company's tangible capital, which, standing at $128.9million as of March 31, was already about $100 million shy ofmeeting regulatory standards.   As reported, Great American has been a victim of thereal-estate bust in Arizona, and must raise at least $350million in capital by year-end or else face regulatorysanctions, possibly including seizure. Analysts have beenskeptical about the company's ability to attract that kind ofsupport, and said the latest disclosure would furthercompound the task. The company has conceded that any suchinfusion would likely seriously dilute the interests ofcurrent shareholders.   &quot;I can't think of a more difficult assignment for anyonethan to raise $350 million at this point in time, given thereal-estate uncertainties in their markets,&quot; said AllanBortel, a thrift analyst at Sutro andamp; Co. in San Francisco.   Some analysts said Great American's dispute illustratesthe increasingly aggressive approach that regulators havetaken in forcing conservative accounting by banks andthrifts, based on evidence that seized institutions hadgreatly understated the extent of their troubled loans.   In a statement, Great American asserted that certain ofthe regulators' assumptions were &quot;not currently considered tobe in accordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples.&quot;   Earlier this year, Great American revised itsfourth-quarter financial results after its auditor, Deloitteandamp; Touche, posed concerns over the adequacy of its loan-lossprovisions. The revisions boosted Great American's net lossfor the quarter ended Dec. 31 to $198.9 million, or $8.30 ashare, from an initially reported $59.3 million, or $2.48 ashare.   A spokesman said the first-quarter results were unaudited,but that asset-valuation methods used in the quarter wereconsistent with those that Deloitte andamp; Touche had approved inthe preceding quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
