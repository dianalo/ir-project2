The record global grain stockpiles arereceding and consumer demand is helping push up prices a bit.   It's sort of an economic twilight time, an uncertain period thatmight portend another world food crisis of the sort that occursperiodically, often when there is massive crop failure or othercatastrophe.   On the other hand, American farmers have idled millions of acresunder government crop programs, and those could be put back to workin short order if the need arises.   Meanwhile, world population keeps increasing, so in the long runfarmers will have to produce even more to fill the orders. Maybethe idled land will have to be put back into crops, regardless ofthe weather, blight and locusts.   A monthly supply-and-demand analysis issued last week by theAgriculture Department showed that the world stockpile of grain _including wheat, corn and milled rice _ is expected to be about 165million metric tons at the end of the 1987-88 marketing season.That would be a 19 percent drop from more than 203 million tonsleft over at the end of 1986-87.   The overall figure includes a 32 percent drop in the size of thewheat inventory; a 40 percent decline for rice; and a 16 percentdrop for corn.   The statistics showed that the inventory declines resulted fromsmaller harvests in 1987-88 and a rise in consumption.   Last fall, the Washington-based consulting firm of E.A. Jaenke andamp;Associates noted in a series of articles that it's ``too early todeclare victory'' over world hunger, despite what some of theexperts say.   ``We do that every 10 years,'' the Jaenke report said. ``In themid-1960s, following massive U.S. grain shipments to feed thestarving in India, the Green Revolution emerged to erase fooddeficits in South Asia and create general optimism that hunger wasa thing of the past.''   But by 1974, hunger had broken out again.   ``There was bad weather in the Soviet Union and Africa, a poorfish crop off Peru, and of all things: a grain shortfall in theUnited States,'' the report said. ``Secretary of State HenryKissinger called a world food conference in Rome, and sure enoughthe problem was solved within a year.''   But in 1983-84, the ``most publicized food crisis of alloccurred in some two dozen countries of Africa,'' the report said.``The U.S. and other nations responded with food and money, and theAmerican pop music industry organized a transatlantic `Live Aid'concert in July 1985 that raised tens of millions of dollars.Again, the pendulum swung, and the hunger story disappeared fromAmerican television screens.''   The world produces plenty of food, but it comes mostly from arelatively few countries, including the United States. Countriesthat have the money can afford to buy from the surplus holders. Inthe Third World, where money is scarce, hunger can be plentiful.   Estimates by the United Nations' Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO) show that in 1985 an estimated 512 millionpeople suffered from hunger and malnutrition and the effects ofmalnutrition in developing countries other than China, an increaseof 37 million from 1980.   ``Hunger doesn't have much to do with the general availabilityof food in the world, it has to do with poverty,'' the Jaenkereport said. ``Poor countries and poor people don't eat wellbecause they don't have the money.''   It added: ``The truth is that we will solve world hunger onlywith economic growth that puts money in people's pockets andcreates new customers for the world's farmers.''   Earlier this month, 200 agriculture and development experts metin another World Food Conference in Brussels, Belgium, to see whatcould be done about surpluses building up in the developed nationswhile much of the Third World goes hungry.   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda pleaded for an end to``economic parochialism'' and a greater liberalization of worldtrade. He urged the big food producers not to dump surpluses on theThird World as food aid.   Instead, he said, self-sufficiency and development should benurtured in the Third World.   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng called for an end to farmsubsidies as a way of bringing about reform. That view, firstadvocated last year, has been attacked frequetly by EuropeanEconomic Community leaders.   Frans Andriessen, the EEC agriculture commissioner, told theBrussels conference that the U.S. position was ``neither possiblenor desirable'' and that ``some form of stabilization andprotectionism'' will always be needed.   Lyng said the United States over the last several years has beenshifting to a more market-oriented agricuture ``with a fair degreeof success.''   Reduced domestic price supports on feed grains, rice and wheat,and lower target prices across the board have helped discourageworldwide overproduction and have helped boost U.S. sales, he said.   ``The disruptive effect on world trade from existing policieshas been damaging to those who can least afford it _ the developingnations,'' Lyng said. ``Thus, in those countries where agriculturalexports are the main source of revenue, the increased income fromliberalizing trade should stimulate domestic economies.''   By removing agricultural subsidies, the Third World will havemore to invest in other domestic and export industries, he said.Domestic income growth would be stimulated and debt burdens can beeased.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 17</NOTE></DOC>
