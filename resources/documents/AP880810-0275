But the three principals of Coniston Partners _ Paul TierneyJr., Augustus Oliver and Keith Gollust _ hardly fit the mold ofcorporate raiders. Think of them more as refined persuaders _ withthe emphasis on persuasion.   Unlike workaholic dealmakers, the Coniston partners takethree-day weekends, occasionally saunter about the office in jeansand give money and time to a number of social causes.   It could be their youthful appearances and their fresh sense ofpace that attracts people willing to invest $5 million each to jointheir funds. More likely, however, it is the promise of a handsomereturn, which has averaged in excess of 35 percent a year. Thoseinvestors have helped the partners build a warchest estimated at$700 million.   Typically, the partners parlay that cash into big profits bysnapping up a large block of shares in an undervalued company andpressing management to make changes that will boost the stock price.   While that's not much different from the modus operandi of aCarl Icahn or a T. Boone Pickens, the Coniston boys have added adash of soft soap to the business. Unlike Icahn, they aren'tinterested in taking over their targets. They would rather cajolefrom the outside and get managers to fix their own problems.   They prefer ``sweet-talking'' to ``fist-pounding,'' said DonaldCarter, president of the Carter Organization, which has representedConiston in several boardroom battles.   More than that, says Oliver, a 38-year-old lawyer formerly witha prestigious New York firm, ``We approach things like the debateover the future of a company with a certain amount of personalintegrity.''   That's not to say the Coniston partners are anything less thantenacious. Their latest contest, with razor-blade maker GilletteCo., involved a bitter proxy battle that saw Coniston narrowly losea bid for four seats on Gillette's board. Subsequent legalwrangling ended in a settlement under which Coniston agreed not toincrease its stake in Gillette or seek control of the company forthree years. Gillette, in turn, agreed to buy back 16 millionshares of its stock at $45 each.   While Coniston should make about $44 million from thatinvestment, the profit came at a price. The partners had about $3million in legal fees and never saw Gillette sold for the $50 ashare they believed it was worth.   ``It wasn't a very satisfying end to the struggle,'' Tierneyadmitted.   The fight also shed a negative light on one of Coniston's mostprized investors, Tito Tettamanti, a Swiss businessman who leadswealthy Europeans into the Coniston fold.   Gillette characterized Tettamanti in full-page newspaperadvertisements as ``part of the tangled web of Coniston-relatedforeign and domestic corporations and partnerships.''   The Coniston partners rebuffed hints that Tettamanti figured intheir decision making, which has been the trio's sole purview sinceGollust teamed up with Tierney a decade ago. Oliver, whose lightbrown mane hangs to his shoulders, joined in 1984, eager to escapethe law firm's constrained atmosphere and rigorous 50-hour workweek.   Besides Gillette, their successes have included StorerCommunications, where Coniston made about $39 million in a 1985leveraged buyout. The partnership also made a quick $60 million byselling its 12 percent stake in Viacom International when thecompany was acquired by National Amusements in 1987.   Their best deal by far was their investment in Allegis, nowknown as UAL Corp. With a 14 percent stake in the company, Conistonpressed Allegis to sell its Westin and Hilton International hoteloperations and Hertz car rental business. Coniston cashed in mostof its stock at a profit of about $460 million when the companybought back shares at $80 apiece.   Despite the riches of their success, the Coniston partnersmaintain modest offices overlooking fashionable Park Avenue. Fromtheir fifth-floor vantage point, litter on the street is stillvisible, and cab honking is quite audible.   ``We attempt to corral the level of greed and realize money isonly one of the things you work for,'' said 45-year-old Tierney,whose office is adorned with family photos of a recent Africansafari.   Investors in Coniston's various funds may be less altruistic.Last year, the partners raised the minimum investment from $2million to $5 million because ``the bulk of our investors wereinterested and willing to invest more,'' Tierney said.   Once clients decide to put their money with Coniston, that's thelast say they have in how it's used. As limited partners, investorsare told in no uncertain terms that they'll remain ``totallypassive,'' Tierney said.   ``Investors know what they read in the paper, and they know whattheir capital account is at the end of the year,'' said Gollust,43. ``We've never had any complaints,'' he added with a smirk.   Coniston's roughly 75 investors get no dividends _ the onlyopportunity they have to take profits is when they leave the fund.   Investors are assessed a ``management fee'' of 20 percent ofprofits per year. Fortune magazine estimated last year that the feegenerated some $50 million in income for the partners, not countingthe substantial personal stake each has invested in the firm.   The partners say their art comes in deciding collectively whichof a number of companies with similar financial profiles is theright investment. While the odd man out has no allies, he does notfeel alienated.   ``If I'm in the minority, I'm grateful I have two partners whosee things differently from me because I would have made amistake,'' Gollust said.   The partners and the three investment professionals who workwith them meander in and out of each other's small offices freely,discussing ideas that may have come to mind while windsurfing orbrainstorming.   ``We do not want to build a large organization in terms ofpeople,'' Tierney said, partly because it might mean compromisingtheir relaxed work environment.   Tierney says striking a comfortable balance between the spoilsof wealth and social concerns is a struggle. The former Peace Corpsvolunteer has had a hand in local government, the PTA and sportscoaching, and lately has been mulling a contribution to thepresidential campaign of Democrat Michael Dukakis.   Oliver has pledged to pay college tuition for a class of 33Hispanic teens, and he and his wife have taken the group tobaseball games, the theater, even to the Coniston offices.   ``Each of us has a different sense of things we'd like to seedone in the world,'' said Oliver. ``Although making money is one,none of us has the goal of being the richest person in the world.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday editions, Aug. 12</NOTE></DOC>
