He declined to call for a ban on U.S.-produced semiautomaticassault-style rifles _ a favorite weapon of drug traffickers _ butsaid he would make permanent a ban on many of their importedcounterparts.   In measures expected to be popular with law enforcementofficials, he called for a minimum 10-year sentence for usingsemiautomatic weapons during a crime, and an end to the dropping ofgun-use charges through plea bargaining.   He also recommended more money for federal law enforcementagents and prosecutors and an expansion in the number of federalcrimes calling for the death penalty.   Both sides in the gun-control debate objected to parts of thepackage.   But Bush said it would send a message to criminals: ``We'regoing to take back the streets.''   ``For far too long, a privileged class of violent and repeatoffenders have calculated that crime really does pay, that ourcriminl justice system is a crapshoot where the risks are worth therewards. Well, it's time we change the odds and up the stakesenormously,'' the president said in a speech at a National PeaceOfficers' Memorial Service.   Bush stood in the rain at the Capitol before an audience thatincluded more than 700 relatives of the 161 officers killed in theline of duty nationwide last year. Also present were uniformedofficers from around the country.   Two Democratic senators quickly found fault with Bush'sproposal, Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio saying he was ``disappointedthat the president chose to limit his action'' on semiautomatics toimported weapons, and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina declaringthat if Bush were serious about the recommendations he would havesaid where the money was going to come from.   The National Rifle Association, the nation's largest gun lobby,applauded Bush's proposals to get tougher on criminals butcriticized his steps to restrict assault weapons.   ``We don't see a heck of a difference between a 15-roundmagazine and three five-round magazines other than about the twoseconds it takes to change from one to another,'' said James Baker,the NRA's chief lobbyist in Washington. ``That's not going to havean effect on criminals.''   An administration official, commenting on condition he not benamed, said some money was already in the budget, for prisonconstruction, and some would be shifted from other law enforcementareas, but most would have to come from a cushion of``discretionary funds'' built into the budget compromise worked outby the White House and congressional leaders.   Some of the president's proposals, such as the ban on clips morethan 15 rounds, require congressional legislation, while otherscould be covered by administrative action. Most assault-styleweapons used by criminals are equipped with 20-round magazines, theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms says.   Bush, in his proposals for making federal sentences for variouscrimes tougher and surer, made no mention of changing the federalfurlough system, which allows some convicted felons, including drugoffenders, to go home on weekend passes. During the presidentialcampaign, Bush repeatedly criticized the furlough program inMassachussetts, the home state of his Democratic opponent, Gov.Michael Dukakis.   In remarks awaited with great anticipation by both gun ownersand gun-control advocates, Bush said he would make permanent hisban on imports that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearmssays are not for sport.   That requirement is already contained in federal law, but beforehis announcement in March of a temporary ban, such guns had enteredthe country by the thousands largely because of difficulty indefining whether they were for sporting or other use. In March,Bush ordered the agency to review and resolve the issue.   As to why Bush made a distinction between imports and domesticmodels with virtually the same firepower, the administrationofficial said only that imports can be dealt with under existinglaw while it would require pushing new legislation through Congressto restrict the others.   Among provisions in the anti-crime package, Bush would:   _Double the current five-year minimum sentence for using asemiautomatic firearm in a crime. ``No probation, no parole,'' Bushsaid.   _Recommend the death penalty for people who commit a number offederal offenses already on the books including murder for hire,killings by federal prisoners serving life sentences, terroristmurders of American citizens, and murders of hostages.   The administration is also proposing changes to allow forexecutions for such crimes as treason and espionage underprovisions now in disuse because statutes do not satisfy SupremeCourt guidelines.   _Spend $1 billion for new prison construction; identifygovernment properties and facilities for conversion to jails andprisons.   _Authorize 825 new federal agents and staff in the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. Marshals Service and theFBI. Bush said, ``Our police need more help. ... We're prepared tomatch rhetoric with resources _ and call on our cities and statesto do the same.''   _Amend the Armed Career Criminal statue to include juvenileconvictions when deciding whether someone is a habitual criminaland thus subject to an enhanced sentence.   _Expand the existing ban on firearm sales to people convicted ofcertain violent crimes, to cover anyone convicted of violentmisdemeanor offenses.   _Add 1,600 positions in the U.S. attorneys' office.</TEXT></DOC>
