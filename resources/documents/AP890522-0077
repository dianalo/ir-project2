Prosecutors and defense attorneys said at Secord's arraignmentbefore U.S. District Court Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson that theywill discuss whether to combine the latest set of charges with anearlier indictment. A hearing on the question will be held May 31.Secord was released on his own recognizance.   The latest indictment, nine counts unsealed May 11 after theconclusion of Oliver North's criminal trial, accuses Secord ofobstructing the congressional Iran-Contra investigation in 1987,perjury and making a false statement.   Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, said he might have to withdrawfrom the case because ``I was privy to and was a party todiscussions with Congress'' in connection with Secord's 1987congressional testimony. Therefore, Green might be called as awitness at the trial, he said.   Green said he would ``under those circumstances'' withdraw fromthe case in favor of a partner in his law firm, James E. Sharp, whostood next to Secord as he was arraigned. Prosecutor ReidWeingarten said that ``usually the entire firm is dismissed'' asthe attorney for a defendant when one of the firm's lawyers becomesa witness in the case. Weingarten said ``we must explore''propriety of the firm of Sharp, Green andamp; Lankford representingSecord.   Secord pleaded innocent last year to six other criminal chargesin an indictment accusing him and three others of illegallydiverting more than $14 million in U.S. Iran arms sale proceeds tothe Nicaraguan rebels.   Charged with the former Air Force major general in that 1988indictment were business partner Albert Hakim, former nationalsecurity adviser John Poindexter and former National SecurityCouncil aide North. Conspiracy and theft charges against Northrelating to the diversion were dropped before his trial. The formerNSC aide was convicted earlier this month of three criminal chargesin the Iran-Contra scandal.   North enlisted Secord in 1984 to run weapons secretly to theContras during a congressional cutoff in military aid to the rebelforce.   Secord and Hakim carried out their work for North and the Reaganadministration through a network of offshore companies and Swissbank accounts dubbed the Enterprise.   Secord is accused of lying when he told Congress that he wasn'ttaking profits from the Enterprise. In fact, said the federal grandjury indictment, Secord used a former Internal Revenue Servicelawyer ``on a continuous basis to manage over a million dollars ofprofits allocated to the defendant, Richard V. Secord.''   He also was accused of lying when he told Congress that:   _His only financial gain from the arms sales to the Contras andIran was his $6,000-a-month salary.   _Half a million dollars from the Enterprise funneled to one ofhis companies in Virginia was a loan.   _He was unaware any money from the Enterprise benefited North,who was convicted of illegally accepting a $13,800 home securitysystem from Secord. In addition, the government alleges, Secord andHakim arranged to set aside $200,000 as a death benefit for theeducation of North's children.</TEXT></DOC>
