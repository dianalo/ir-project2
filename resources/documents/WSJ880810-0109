Some shipping executives think the plan, if approved in Washington, could strengthen and streamline the struggling U.S.-flag container ship industry.    The innovative arrangement, announced last month by Edison, N.J.-based Sea-Land, includes the creation of a new ship company, Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Shipping Corp. The new concern, which isn't owned by Sea-Land, agreed in principle last month to acquire a small subsidized U.S. carrier, closely held Farrell Lines Inc., and to obtain certain subsidy rights from closely held Lykes Bros. Steamship Co.    Sea-Land plans to lease 24 of its largest vessels to Aandamp;P Shipping, which would then lease back the ships to Sea-Land at lower charter rates reflecting subsidy rights transferred from Farrell and Lykes.    The plan faces major obstacles, including opposition from some rival U.S. carriers, and is subject to approval by the Maritime Administration. Earlier this week, the plan also was set back when Waterman Marine Corp., another subsidized ship company that had agreed to be acquired by Aandamp;P Shipping, decided to withdraw from the transaction.    Nevertheless, some ship industry executives are impressed by Sea-Land's ingenuity. The plan is a &quot;clever way to get a subsidy where subsidies were not intended,&quot; said Paul Slater, chairman of First International Financial Corp., a Naples, Fla.-based ship finance company.    Analysts said the plan would indirectly secure for Sea-Land the $48 million in federal shipping subsidies. Such payments would add about 20 cents annually to the per-share net income of CSX, a Richmond, Va.-based transportation and natural resources company that bought Sea-Land in 1986. Last year, CSX had earnings of $138 million, or $2.78 a share, on revenue of $8.04 billion, with Sea-Land accounting for 30 cents of CSX's per-share net and $1.79 billion of its revenue.    Sea-Land wasn't always a fan of government ship subsidies, which are designed to offset the high cost of U.S. crews required on U.S.-flagged merchant ships. For years, Sea-Land eschewed subsidies, lest it be subject to government regulation of where its ships are built and operated. It also spent millions of dollars lobbying against relief of subsidy-related operating restrictions on its competitors. &quot;Subsidy is not only not required to be successful in our business, but, in some very real ways, it is counterproductive,&quot; a Sea-Land chairman said a few years ago.    But Sea-Land's position has changed because of mounting competition from low-cost foreign rivals and a move by the Reagan administration to lift some restrictions on subsidized carriers. For example, the government has granted U.S.-flag container carriers exemptions to build some vessels in foreign shipyards, which build at one-third the cost of U.S. yards, while still qualifying for subsidy payments.    &quot;Sea-Land has gone from a strong position of government hands-off to government handout,&quot; says Gerald Seifert, general counsel for maritime policy at the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. But Sea-Land's recent attempts to obtain subsidies have failed. One obstacle is the administration, which doesn't want to expand ship subsidies that now total about $200 million a year. Numerous bills in Congress that would allow Sea-Land a share of existing subsidies have failed to win broad ship industry support.    &quot;It got pretty frustrating,&quot; said Peter Finnerty, a Sea-Land vice president, referring to nearly a dozen failed attempts in Congress to restructure ship subsidies. Some of the bills stalled because of opposition from U.S. shipyards and subsidized carriers, including Waterman and Farrell. So last January, a group of Sea-Land executives, including Mr. Finnerty, conceived the charter and lease-back plan. Later, Sea-Land officials turned to First Boston Corp., which formed Aandamp;P Shipping.    The new company has been seeking to create a network of active and inactive subsidy contracts that can be applied to Sea-Land vessels in the trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trades. As part of that effort, Aandamp;P Shipping set its sights on Waterman and Farrell for their subsidized trans-Atlantic routes. And through a proposed exchange of subsidy contracts with New Orleans-based Lykes Bros. Steamship, it is on the verge of obtaining authority to operate a subsidized trans-Pacific service.    When it withdrew from the transaction, Waterman cited disagreement on allocation of costs and risks, but said the proposed purchase price of $34 million was still acceptable. Paul Richardson, president of Aandamp;P Shipping, said the withdrawal of Waterman is &quot;an aggravation but not a deal killer.&quot;    The complex transactions could cause an increase in the total amount of government subsidies. Some industry sources expect the subsidies to rise as much as $13 million to $15 million a year, depending on how many Sea-Land vessels qualify for subsidies and how many of Farrell's subsidized vessels continue to sail.    Nonetheless, the plan is already winning some supporters who think it will boost U.S.-flag shipping, whose share of U.S. container cargo has plunged to 15% from 30% in 1975. Mr. Seifert, the committee counsel, said the plan would redistribute subsidies to &quot;a more efficient carrier from less efficient carriers&quot; and thereby create &quot;a U.S. merchant fleet that is ready to do battle with the foreigners.&quot;    Sea-Land, the country's largest container ship company, has been bracing for combat in other ways as well. It spent $454 million during the past two years to buy container ships, including 12 giant vessels from defunct U.S. Lines Inc.    Shipping executives expect the novel transaction between Sea-Land and Aandamp;P Shipping to win approval from the Maritime Administration. John Gaughan, the agency's head, declined to comment other than to say that he is &quot;encouraged&quot; by the infusion of capital into the U.S. merchant marine that Aandamp;P Shipping represents.    But Senate legislation to make 12 of Sea-Land's foreign-built ships eligible for subsidies, a key ingredient of Sea-Land's transaction with Aandamp;P Shipping, has met stiff opposition. American President Cos., an Oakland, Calif.-based carrier, recently criticized the bill, saying it would strengthen only Sea-Land at the expense of other U.S. carriers. American President, which receives subsidies of about $60 million a year, urged Sea-Land instead to back industry efforts in Congress to deregulate the entire U.S.-flag container fleet.    &quot;Legislation is needed to help all U.S. carriers, not just one, compete more effectively with foreign carriers,&quot; said Timothy Rhein, president of American President's ocean ship unit. The company is seeking permission to modernize its fleet by having vessels built abroad eligible for subsidies.    But Sea-Land isn't optimistic about legislation to reform federal ship subsidies for all carriers. &quot;We tried that about 10 times and it hasn't worked,&quot; said Mr. Finnerty, the Sea-Land vice president, who calls American President's proposal a &quot;delaying tactic.&quot; Meanwhile, Mr. Finnerty said, American President &quot;enjoys the benefits of subsidy and we have nothing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
