The case, in which accounting giant Ernst andamp; Young wasfound to have committed securities fraud, could affectnumerous lawsuits charging that accountants, lawyers andconsultants participated in the looting of savings-and-loanassociations and other financial institutions. Such liabilityclaims against outside professionals became common in the1980s, particularly as a result of massive failures in theSandamp;L industry.</LP><TEXT>   The justices will consider the type of evidence thatalleged fraud victims must prove to win a civil lawsuitbrought against accountants under the Racketeer Influencedand Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. White-collardefendants have contended that RICO was designed primarily toattack organized crime but that it has been distorted tobrand professionals as racketeers and to impose cripplingfinancial penalties. The Supreme Court has said that RICOgenerally should be interpreted broadly.   In the case the high court agreed to hear, a corporatepredecessor of Ernst andamp; Young was sued for helping to concealthe perilous financial condition of a farmers' cooperativethat operated in Arkansas and Oklahoma. The plaintiffs,individual investors who had bought unsecured notes from thecooperative before it went bankrupt, charged Ernst andamp; Youngwith violations of federal securities law and of RICO. Beforetrial, the judge threw out the RICO claim. Ernst andamp; Young wasfound to have committed securities fraud, and the juryawarded the investors $6.1 million to compensate them fortheir losses.   After further litigation, which included an earlier rulingby the Supreme Court on a separate issue, a federal appealscourt affirmed the verdict against Ernst andamp; Young, said theamount of damages should be recalculated, and sustained thetrial judge's decision to exclude the RICO claim.   To be found liable under RICO, a defendant must engage ina &quot;pattern of racketeering&quot; by means of a corrupt enterprise.The law covers anyone who participates either &quot;directly orindirectly&quot; in the enterprise.   The federal appeals court in St. Louis ruled that Ernst andamp;Young's conduct wasn't covered by RICO because it didn't&quot;rise to the level of participation in the management oroperation&quot; of the cooperative. But the appeals courtacknowledged that other federal courts have interpreted RICOliability more liberally.   Citing the conflict among different jurisdictions, thenoteholders appealed to the Supreme Court. The investorsargued that under the St. Louis appeals court's standardalmost any outside adviser can escape RICO liability. Thehigh court agreed to consider this contention, but itdeclined to hear Ernst andamp; Young's separate appeal of the fraudverdict. (Reves vs. Ernst andamp; Young)   ---   Haitian Refugees                                                                                                          The Supreme Court refused to block the forced return ofHaitian refugees by the U.S. government. The justices ruled,8-1, against hearing a formal challenge of the Bushadministration's repatriation of thousands of Haitians whohave fled the political and economic turmoil in theirhomeland. The high court also rejected an emergency requestto stop the repatriation temporarily. As is its practice, thecourt didn't explain either action.   Lawyers for the Haitians contend that many of the refugeesface beating, kidnapping and other forms of abuse if they arereturned. But the Bush administration insists that it hasfound no evidence to corroborate reports of persecution.   In a recent filing with the high court, the U.S. JusticeDepartment said that &quot;no one in the executive branch woulddeny that the situation in Haiti is unfortunate.&quot; But thedepartment asserted that the Supreme Court lacks theconstitutional authority to second-guess the president andCongress on foreign policy.   Justice Harry Blackmun dissented from yesterday'sdecision, stressing that the legal issues in the Haitianscase &quot;are at least as significant as any&quot; the high courtagreed to consider yesterday in other disputes. JusticeClarence Thomas, who at an earlier stage of the case votedfor a temporary halt to the repatriation, wrote a separateopinion saying that he is &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about thereturnees but that &quot;this matter must be addressed by thepolitical branches, for {the Supreme Court's} role is limitedto questions of law.&quot; (Haitian Refugee Center vs. Baker)   ---   Judicial Impeachment                                                                                                          The high court agreed to consider the judiciary'sauthority to review congressional procedures for impeachingand convicting federal judges. The case involves the 1989impeachment and removal from office of former U.S. JudgeWalter Nixon of Mississippi.   Mr. Nixon was convicted in federal court of lying to agrand jury that had investigated bribery charges against him.Even after conviction, Mr. Nixon refused to resign and drewhis judge's salary while in prison. Subsequently, the Houseof Representatives impeached him for lying to the grand juryand for bringing disrepute on the federal judiciary.   The Senate, which acts like a court in tryingimpeachments, designated a 12-member committee to investigatethe charges. That committee reported to the full Senate,which heard further arguments and then voted to convict Mr.Nixon on two of the three articles of impeachment. Mr. Nixonsued the U.S. in federal court, claiming that the Senate'sfailure to give him a full evidentiary hearing before theentire Senate violated its constitutional duty to &quot;try&quot; allimpeachments.   The trial court rejected Mr. Nixon's claim, concludingthat the Constitution precludes federal courts frominterfering with the impeachment process. A federal appealscourt in Washington affirmed that decision last year. Intheir rulings, the lower courts emphasized constitutionalprovisions that the House shall have &quot;the sole power ofimpeachment&quot; and the Senate shall have &quot;sole power to try allimpeachments.&quot; The courts invoked a 1936 Supreme Courtdecision that interpreted the term &quot;sole power&quot; to mean that&quot;no other tribunal should have any jurisdiction&quot; overimpeachment cases.   The Supreme Court agreed to consider Mr. Nixon'scontentions that the judiciary may review the Senate's use ofa committee to investigate an impeachment and that theprocedure, in fact, &quot;threatens judicial independence&quot; becauseit encourages speedy conviction by uninformed lawmakers.(Nixon vs. U.S.)   ---   In other cases, the high court:   -- Agreed to decide whether plaintiffs in civil rightscases who win only nominal awards -- sometimes as little as$1 -- may nevertheless force their opponents to pay theirlegal fees, which routinely amount to hundreds of thousandsof dollars. (Farrar vs. Hobby)   -- Said it would consider whether states may tax theleasing of shipping containers that are used in internationalcommerce. (ITEL Containers International Corp. vs.Huddleston)   -- Refused to hear an appeal by hotel magnate LeonaHelmsley of her conviction on charges including attempted taxevasion and mail fraud. (Helmsley vs. U.S.)   -- Let stand the dismissal of a lawsuit accusing investorCarl Icahn of extortion and racketeering in connection withhis 1986 agreement to sell back his stake in ViacomInternational Inc. for an above-market price.
