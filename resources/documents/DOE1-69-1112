Unlike the linear aperture of the Tevatronor the SSC for which the random sectupole component of dipoles is animportant factor in limiting its value, the RHIC linear aperture is affectedmost by the random normal and skew quadrupole components since they introducelarge errors in betatron amplitude functions and in dispersion functions.It will be shown that, with eight or twelve dipoles covering four orsix regular cells sorted as a group, one can achieve an improvement offactor four to five over statistically expected values of quantitiessuch as {Delta}{beta}/sub x//{beta}/sub x/)/sub rms/ without introducinga large nonlinear distortion (sometimes called &quot;smear&quot;) arising fromthe random sextupole component.</TEXT></DOC>
