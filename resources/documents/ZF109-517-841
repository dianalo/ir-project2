(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Laser printers are now showing up in places they've never been before and areno longer being considered a luxury item.andP;  Three interrelated reasons areresponsible for these new situations:andM;*  A new generation of extremely basic, low-cost, laser printer models thatmake them affordable;andM;*  Older laser printers are being retrofitted with language, font and add-onsthat offer new functionality;andM;* New developments in page-description languages (PDLs), introducing a newaudience to multiple fonts, scaling and complex-graphics printing.andP;  This lastphenomenon has led to the &quot;font wars.&quot; Lets see what the major combatants areup to:andM;* Hewlett-Packard Co.'s LaserJet III features a new version of its PrinterControl Language (PCL), PCL 5, with font scaling and rotation;andM;* Microsoft Corp. promises that Windows and OS/2 environments willincorporate the TrueType-TrueImage rasterizer-PDL system;andM;* Adobe Systems Inc. announced PostScript Level 2, a major upgrade of itsindustry-standard PDL.andM;A dozen, full-function laser printers at a significantly lower price thanHP's flagship LaserJet Series III characterize this new generation.andP;  Nearlyall these laser printers are intended to be inexpensive stand-ins for theLaserJet Series II and feature:andM;* Small size;andM;* Respectable performance;andM;*  Low cost;andM;*  Modularity;andM;*  Flexibility;andM;*  Ease of use;andM;*  Connectability;andM;*  512K-bytes of standard memory;andM;*  Parallel interface;andM;*  LaserJet II emulation;andM;*  Acceptance of HP-compatible downloadable fonts.andM;Not all these laser printers are brand-new designs.andP;  Fujitsu America Inc.'sRX7100 entry-level laser printer, based on its 5-page-per-minute (ppm)light-emitting diode (LED) array engine, is revamped and price-reduced as theRX7 100/S2.andM;The new model relinquishes one of the two standard 150-sheet input trays.andO;But it upgrades the older model's LaserJet Plus emulation with Series Ilemulation and makes standard the previously optional Epson America Inc.andO;FX-and 80 Diablo 630 emulations.andM;Fujitsu makes available a PostScript option for the 7100/S2 that makes itequivalent to the 7100PS + model.andP;  The user-installable upgrade consists of anew controller board (an Adobe 68000-based &quot;Scout&quot; design) with 4M bytes ofmemory and 35 fonts.andP;  The PostScript version retains the 7100/S2 standardemulations, providing a multimode laser printer.andM;This option is not price-competitive with other laser printers in thisclass-a PostScript-upgraded 7100/S2 is actually positioned against &quot;standard&quot;PostScript machines.andM;Several new models offer enough options to make the term  kit printer&quot;appropriate.andP;  Common add-ons include font cartridges, extra memory,large-capacity paper drawers, envelope feeders and PostScript interpreters.andO;Vendors are trying to simplify the lives of suppliers and users by offering asingle, basic laser printer that can grow as demands increase.andM;This is the case with IBM Corp. whose 5-ppm Laser Printer E uses the sameengine and case as its 10-ppm model 4019-001.andP;  IBM offers all the add-onspreviously mentioned, including two PostScript options.andP;  The base model is asolid, standard LaserJet II clone that builds up into a 35-font, 4.5M-bytePostScript unit.andP;  And a dealer-installed controller-board swap boosts outputto 10 ppm, effectively turning the E into a 4019-001.andM;IBM's field-support manager James Potter explains: &quot;We wanted to protect thecustomer's investment, so all our add-ons will fit both the E and the 4019laser printers.andP;  The advantage to the customer is that they have one productto understand, one product to service and one product to educate theirend-users about.andP;  You don't have to go to another model for upgrades.&quot;andM;The new IBM laser printers, including the engine and the Motorola Inc.andO;68000-based controller, are in-house designs manufactured in IBM plants.andO;Even the native PDL is an IBM development, although it also offers LaserJet11 emulation and PostScript in recognition of customer demand.andM;Select an engineandM;Most vendors build their printers around one of a small number of existingengines from manufacturers such as Sharp Electronics Corp., Canon U.S.A.andO;Inc. or TEC America and add value by varying such features as the controller,paper options and utilities.andM;Good paper-handling and the smallest form factor in the industry are thecompact, 6-ppm Sharp engine's strong points.andP;  The design includes a standard250-sheet internal bin and a 230-sheet face-down output tray-no wings stickout to spoil the silhouette.andP;  Optional trays allow envelope feeding and asecond half-ream of standard-size, legal, A4, B4 or invoice paper.andM;Sharp incorporates its own engine in the JX-9500 laser printer.andP;  Productmanager Fred LaPointe emphasizes the unit's compact size, multiple standardemulations (Diablo 630, Epson FX-80, IBM Graphics and ProPrinter and LaserJetII) and flexible paper-handling.andP;  LaPointe believes that these featuresposition the JX-9500 as a &quot;professional office printer at a personal-printerprice.&quot;andM;Presently, there is no PostScript option available, although the fiveemulations and the paper options make this a likely candidate for ageneral-purpose office laser printer.andM;The Canon engine features a one-piece cartridge whereas Sharp's enginedivides consumables, toner, developer and photoconductor drum into separateunits with different life spans.andP;  These separate units complicate replacementbut save material costs.andP;  For instance, the 25,000-page developer or50,000page photoconductor drum needn't be replaced when the 3,000-page tonerruns out.andM;Mimics IBM's philosophyandM;Texas Instruments Inc., with its microLaser-a Sharp-engine-basedprinter-follows a kit design and marketing philosophy similar to IBM'S.andP;  TIchose the Sharp engine because it allowed them to construct a small, modularproduct-VARs can stock one base model and add options as required.andP;  Thislaser printer is user-upgradable; the controller board slides out like adrawer, allowing piggyback memory and PostScript boards to be plugged in.andM;A microlaser base model is priced lower than the Sharp JX-9500, but as atrade-off, it comes with only the LaserJet II emulation as standard.andP;  Diablo,Epson and IBM emulations are available as plug-in options.andP;  PostScript isavailable in the form of two all-up models, the PS17 and PS35 (1.5M bytes ofmemory and 17 and 35 fonts respectively), or as customer-installableupgrades.andM;The controller on the PostScript models is a TI design featuring two customapplication-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).andP;  Aubrey Brickhouse, managerof printer marketing, explains: &quot;ASICs offload the computational side ofPostScript so that the throughput is dramatically improved.andP;  Our throughputcompares favorably to 8-ppm and even 10-ppm PostScript printers.&quot; Performanceis also helped-typically 25 percent to 30 percent-by the inclusion of Adobe'sATM (Adobe Type Manager) font-rendering code, which also makes better lookingprint at small point sizes.andM;And the microlaser PostScript models address one issue that has botheredmakers of multimode printers: How to gracefully move in or out of PostScriptin a shared-printer environment.andP;  A common situation involves switchingbetween PCL and PostScript modes.andP;  This generally requires a reset, which inturn dumps the printer buffer and spoils whatever job might have beenfinishing when the controller encounters the new emulation.andM;A combination of proprietary hardware and internal software, informallycalled &quot;TINet,&quot; handles emulation switching on the fly, without data loss.andM;The Dataproducts Corp. LZR 650 is another Sharp-engine-based laser printer.andO;Product marketing manager Edward Crowley explains: &quot;This is an end-usermachine that continues our tradition of 'heavy iron' back-room printerperformance but for a work-group printer environment.andP;  The Sharp engine'sfeatures fit the bill for that situation: versatile paper handling,3,000page-per-month duty cycle, and it's cost-effective enough to make senseas a shared-resource printer as well as an individual printer.&quot;andM;Dataproducts distinguishes its printers by concentrating on ease of use.andP;  Itincludes an 18-minute installation video that covers set up, attachment toPCs, switching emulations and the SOFTCON6 set-up utility.andM;Desktop publishers would be interested in adding the Agfa CompugraphicDivision Type Director utility and two outline fonts.andP;  Based on Agfa'sIntellifont technology, this starter package builds and manages fonts invarious point sizes for downloading to the laser printer.andP;  It also producesmatching screen fonts for Windows, Aldus Corp's.andP;  Page-Maker and VenturaSoftware Inc. Ventura Publisher.andM;Enters now raceandM;Dataproducts intends to keep the LZR 650 as its basic LaserJet II-emulationprinter, while the same Sharp engine forms the basis for an early entry intothe PostScript Level 2 race.andP;  The LZR 660's controller, an Adobe &quot;Garnet&quot;design with Dataproducts enhancements, is built around a Weitek Corp. XL-8200reduced instruction set computer (RISC) chip.andP;  This combination, predictsCrowley, should deliver 20 percent to 30 percent better performance than anApple Computer Inc. LaserWriter IINTX for about half the list price and withall the benefits of PostScript Level 2.andM;With PostScript Level 2-2M bytes of memory and serial, parallel and AppleTalkinterfaces are standard-Dataproducts is aiming the LZR 660 squarely at theApple LaserWriter market.andP;  Crowley sees it as the ideal solution fordistributed shared printing, as distinct from centralized shared printing, onan AppleTalk network.andP;  Because any device on an AppleTalk network can beshared, it is cost-effective to distribute LZR 660s-each can handle two orthree users-throughout the network as workstation printers.andM;Because Apple users and dealers prefer plug-and-play solutions to modular orkit approaches, the LZR 660 will be marketed as an all-up machine.andP;  Upgradeoptions will be available, eventually including a kit (controller board andmemory) to convert an LZR 650 into an LZR 660 for about the same total costas the PostScript Level 2 unit.andM;QMS Inc. has introduced the PS 410, which is built on the 4-ppm Canon LXengine with a Motorola 68020-based controller and 2M bytes of memory,expandable to 6M bytes.andP;  &quot;This printer,&quot; says product manager Kevin Frost,&quot;is the high end of the low end.&quot; It comes with 45 fonts- 10 more than theusual offering.andP;  Although it is a PostScript Level I laser printer, it willboast some features of the PostScript Level 2, such as ATM.andP;  The PS 410 willbe upgradable to PostScript Level 2.andM;Like Dataproducts, QMS is aiming at the shared-printer market.andP;  Frost reportsthat five to 15 users may share one printer, resulting in considerable demandfor a &quot;personal&quot; laser printer.andM;The PS 410 helps alleviate this problem by coming equipped with standardparallel, RS232 serial and AppleTalk interfaces-all three are always active.andO;An 8K-byte buffer is standard, but more memory can be assigned to the buffer.andO;Frost says that additional printer memory can be partitioned and assigned todifferent user interfaces, allowing a built-in spooling-software type ofsituation.andM;And the problem of mode-switching is solved by QMS' proprietary ESP(emulation-sensing process) technology for automatic switching betweenPostScript and LaserJet Il emulation.andP;  The supported data streams will besensed by the laser printer, so users can treat the laser printer as aPostScript or LaserJet II printer-as the software requires.andP;  &quot;With thiscombination of features,&quot; Frost says, &quot;not only are all interfaces active,they're all accessible.&quot;andM;In addition to the cost reduction of PostScript at the low end, users aregoing to encounter other sophisticated and cost-effective PDLs.andP;  HP's PCL 5,which offers scalable fonts, will become a standard for a large part of thelaser-printer market.andP;  Microsoft's implementing TrueType-Truelmage technologymeans that many users will now be dealing with fonts at a system level.andM;In this context, it's not surprising that Adobe announced a major upgrade ofPostScript, called PostScript Level 2.andP;  Much of the enhancement is aimed athigh-end, corporate and industrial printing: new halftone techniques,improved forms-handling and implementation of internationally recognizedcolor spaces and composite fonts.andM;PostScript Level 2 promises improved basic performance for users.andO;Dataproducts' Crowley says: &quot;There will be definite improvements, veryapplication-specific, like in graphics-intensive situations.andP;  There is alsopattern-caching-that is the ability to define and store  objects,' such ascompany logos, without having to rerasterize them-and dynamic memorymanagement.andP;  These are worth including even on lower-duty-cycle, lower-speedmachines.&quot;andM;Is Level 1 obsolete? Does the introduction of PostScript Level 2 printersleave PostScript Level 1 printers-and their users-behind the eight ball?andO;Apparently not.andP;  PostScript Level 2 is backward-compatible with PostScriptLevel 1; all current applications will run under PostScript Level 2.andM;Dr.andP;  Carolyn Bell, director of engineering for Adobe comments: &quot;PostScriptLevel 2 is an evolution, not a revolution.andP;  It's an upgrade and extension oftoday's PostScript.andP;  Anyhow, it will require time for the software to fallinto place and give users the full benefits of PostScript Level 2.&quot; As forupgrading PostScript Level I laser printers to PostScript Level 2, Bellexplains that there are two OEM factors to be addressed:andM;* Should the OEM offer the new controller in the first place? A PostScriptLevel 2 controller can't just be plugged into a printer; the software iscustomized for such things as the characteristics of the front panel andspecial laser-printer features.andP;  Therefore the OEM must work with Adobe onadapting any upgrade.andM;* Did the OEM have upgradability in mind when designing the laser printer?andO;Some laser printers are designed to be easily upgraded and some are not.andO;When an OEM builds a board, it must decide how much ROM can be placed on theboard.andP;  The OEM may not have allowed for enough to accommodate the largercode that PostScript Level 2 requires.andP;  Or, the ROMs may be soldered to theboard rather than socketed, making a retrofit difficult or impossible.andM;New industry standardandM;HP raised the ante in the PDL game when it released the LaserJet Ill with PCL5.andP;  This new industry standard combines an enhanced version of the LaserJetII's PCL 4, HP-GL/2 vector graphics plotter language and internal, scalableoutline fonts.andP;  The internal scalable outline fonts offer on-the-flyscalable-font technology-previously Adobe's speciality-in a mainstream laserprinter for the PC market.andM;PCL 5's font-rendering system is based on the Intellifont technology.andO;Intellifont is licensed from Agfa, the world's second-largest type supplier.andO;The world's largest type supplier is HP itself, on the basis of its PCLlaser-printer sales.andM;Like the Adobe Type I and the forthcoming Microsoft  TrueType-TrueImagesystems, Intellifont is a rasterizing and hinting technology.andP;  The rasterizerturns outlines into bit-maps for the laser printer or computer screen, whilethe hints maintain the letter-form designs even at low resolutions-that is,the 300 dots per inch (dpi) standard for mainstream laser printers.andM;Intellifont also forms the core of Type Director, an off-line font utilitythat integrates several useful functions for LaserJet IIIs and earliernon-PCL 5 printers.andP;  In addition to downloadable scalable fonts for theLaserJet 111, Type Director creates bit-mapped soft fonts for any supportedprinter and screen fonts for WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)environments such as Windows, and it will download and manage other LaserJetII-compatible soft fonts.andM;Type Director also includes AutoFont Support, which is an HP plan tointegrate and manage font information for PCL-based printers and toincorporate font metric data into applications.andP;  All HP font cartridges nowwill come with AutoFont Support disks that can install font data intoapplications.andM;The old method of distributing fonts required hard-coding of font metricsinto the printer driver for each application.andP;  The new method requires thatthe application be able to read Tagged Font Metric (TFM) files-the payoff isthat a single printer driver will be able to handle any HP font.andP;  TFM filesare, among other things, replacements for spacing tables.andM;Older laser printers and basic laser-printer models are becoming candidatesfor retrofitting with high-performance PDLs.andP;  PostScript, an industrystandard, has attracted the most attention with add-on cartridge productsfrom Adobe, HP and Pacific Data Products.andP;  These cartridge products are aimedat the largest installed base of PCL 4 laser printers (LaserJet IIs, LaserJetIIPs and LaserJet IIDs).andP;  PCL 5, the next widespread standard, is not farbehind.andM;The Adobe and HP cartridge products represent an interesting case of rivalsselling in each other's markets.andP;  Bell comments on the Adobe product: &quot;We'reselling this cartridge with HP's blessing.andP;  The HP cartridge is strictly forthe LaserJet III, while ours is for the LaserJet IIs and Pluses.andP;  We are notdirectly competing with our OEMS, because we only sell into the installedbase of older LaserJets.&quot;andM;HP's cartridge is genuine licensed PostScript.andP;  But that is not the case withPacific.andP;  It is shipping 5,000 units a month of the PacificPage PostScriptcartridge for the LaserJet IIP and LaserJet IID.andP;  While Pacific supplies thehardware expertise for the PDL to work in the cartridge format, the languageitself is an OEM product from Phoenix Technologies Ltd. Phoenix prefers tocall its printer-language products-collectively namedPhoenixPage-interpreters, not clones.andM;Once the cartridge has taken command of a printer's controller hardware, thePhoenixPage firmware accepts the data stream sent by an application-say, aPostScript file.andP;  A language-specific module, which is called the PrinterLanguage Interpreter (PLI), translates the PostScript commands into a formthat is understandable by a second module, the Page Description Interface(PDI).andM;This PDI is the heart of this system-a kernel of basic, generalized graphicsfunctions combined with a Font Manager, a general-purpose font-rendering andscaling engine.andP;  The Font Manager copes with a variety of proprietaryrasterizing and hinting schemes such as Adobe Type 1, Bitstream Inc.'sFontware and Speedo, and Intellifont-thanks to a smart software interfacecalled Font Sockets.andP;  Commands for specific marks on the page are passed tothe laser-printer engine by the Supervisor module, which also handleshousekeeping chores such as the front panel and emulation switching.andM;The PhoenixPage PS/PLI (PostScript/Printer Language Interpreter) is Phoenix'sown implementation of the language, but other renderings and fonttechnologies are licensed.andP;  Agfa licenses Intellifont to Phoenix (and toother OEMs and systems integrators) wherewith Phoenix provides the basis forPCL 5 emulation.andP;  The Phoenix product is LJ III/PLI  LaserJet III/PrinterLanguage Interpreter), which in turn shows up in the retail marketplace asthe Pacific FivePage PCL 5 emulation cartridge for LaserJet II, LaserJet IIDand LaserJet IIP models.andM;Companies mentioned in this articleandM;Adobe Systems Inc. 1585 Charleston Road Mountain View, CA (415) 961-4400andM;Agfa Corp.
