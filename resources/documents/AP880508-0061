He says Bush ``listened ... with surprise and consternation onhis face'' and exclaimed, ``Good God. I had no idea.''   Regan portrayed Reagan as a reluctant decision-maker.   ``He listened, encouraged, deferred,'' he wrote. ``But it was arare meeting in which he made a decision or issued orders.''   ``Never did he issue a direct order, although I, at least,sometimes devoutly wished that he would,'' Regan added. ``Helistened, acquiesced, played his role, and waited for the next actto be written.''   ``In the four years that I served as secretary of the Treasury,I never saw President Reagan alone and never discussed economicphilosophy alone and never discussed economic philosophy or fiscaland monetary policy with him man to man.   ``From first day to last at Treasury, I was flying by the seatof my pants. The president never told me what he believed or whathe wanted to accomplish in the field of economics. I had to figurethese things out like any other American, by studying his speechesand reading the newspapers.''   While critical of the president's hands-off style, Regan alsocommented that such a laid-back presidency created ``an atmosphereof confidence and political dynamism.''   Regan stressed, that in the president's mind, there was never aswap of arms for hostages at the time the United States was sendingweapons to Tehran.   Regan recalled that McFarlane first mentioned establishing tieswith Iran during a fateful July 18, 1985, meeting with Reaganfollowing his colon cancer surgery. The former chief of staffcontended that, contrary to McFarlane's testimony before the TowerCommission, there was no mention of an arms-for-hostages deal.   In fact, Regan called the meeting ``routine in memory,'' andcontended he might not even have remembered it ``if I hadn't hadsuch a difficult time persuading his (Reagan's) wife to let it takeplace.''   ``There is nothing in my notes or memory to suggest that theidea of swapping arms for hostages was mentioned by either man onthis occasion. ... I am sure that any mention of such a schemewould have made me prick up my ears,'' Regan wrote.   The former chief of staff said he believes the president'scontention that he knew nothing of the diversion of funds to theContra rebels until told about it by Attorney General Edwin MeeseIII on Nov. 25, 1986.   ``The president ... is a ruddy man, with bright red cheeks. Heblanched when he heard Meese's words. The color drained from hisface, leaving his skin pasty white. ... Nobody who saw thepresident's reaction that afternoon could believe for a moment thathe knew about the diversion of funds before Meese told him aboutit. He was the picture of a man to whom the inconceivable hadhappened.''   Regan blamed Reagan's former aides for the debacle that befellthe president and ultimately engulfed himself.   ``Much of what happened was hidden from the president (andincidentally from me) by McFarlane and his successor as nationalsecurity adviser, Adm. (John) Poindexter and by the remarkableyoung Marine who was a virtual stranger to both of us, Lt. Col.Oliver L. North,'' Regan wrote.   ``As to the responsibility for the chaos that descended on theWhite House, that appears to have been written in the stars,'' hewrote.   He said that he urged the president to counteract the effects ofthe Iran-Contra affair by undertaking an active speaking scheduleoutside Washington, but was balked by astrological advice to thefirst lady that ``harm would come to Reagan if he went out of theWhite House.''   ``By humoring her, we had given her control,'' he said of Mrs.Reagan.   He says Reagan was first told the details of the proposed armssales to Iran by McFarlane, during the November 1985 Geneva summitmeeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``Although he listened intently to McFarlane's words, thepresident asked few questions,'' he wrote. ``He looked straight atMcFarlane, occasionally glancing at (Secretary of State George)Shultz or me as if to study our reactions.'' He says Shultz``commented very sparingly'' during the 20-minute meeting and thepresident ended by ``once again saying yes by not saying no.''   The former chief of staff indicated the meeting was typical ofReagan's style.   Regan related a stormy conversation between himself and thepresident on the day he found himself suddenly replaced by HowardH. Baker Jr. as chief of staff. Reagan failed to persuade him tostay on and work with Baker during the transition.   As Regan described it, he said, ``I'm sorry, Mr. President, butI won't be in any more. This is my last day. I've been yoursecretary of the Treasury for four years and your chief of stafffor two. You don't trust me enough even to tell me who my successoris and make a smooth transfer. I deserved better treatment thanthis. I'm through. I'm very disappointed.''   Despite their difficult parting, he wrote, ``my admiration forReagan as president remains very great.''   ``My judgment of him as a man, in light of my final experienceas his chief of staff, underwent a certain change, but this isirrelevant,'' he said. ``Any man who had seen as much of the worldas I had seen when I came to Washington knew better than to put histrust in princes.''</TEXT></DOC>
