These potential performance improvements, coupledwith additional benefits of high-temperature superconductivity, providea very strong motivation to develop high-temperature superconductivity(HTS) applied-field magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thruster propulsion systems.The application of HTS to MPD thruster propulsion systems may producean enabling technology for these electric propulsion systems. This papersummarizes the impact that HTS may have upon MPD propulsion systems.</TEXT></DOC>
