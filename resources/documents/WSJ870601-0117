Freddie &quot;Banks&quot; Bentivegna saw that look recently, sitting there helplessly while Ms. Balukas, in dead-stroke, methodically ran off three racks of 9-Ball to win her opening round of the Classic Cup (men's division) in this Chicago suburb.    After the dusting, Freddie snarled at some of his own former victims: &quot;Hey, she'll beat plenty of guys before she's done. Don't worry 'bout it.&quot;    Matching up against men may be old hat for Jean Balukas (as a teen-ager, she once beat Willie Mosconi), but the men across the green don't always take it in stride. Consider 1966 world champ Cisero Murphy, who crumbled (while his colleagues grumbled) at the 1980 world tournament. &quot;It's a no-win situation,&quot; said a Professional Pool Players Association board member at the time. &quot;If he loses, he gets laughed at; if he wins, who cares?&quot; He lost, and the now-defunct PPPA cared enough to bar Ms. Balukas the following year.    For most of her 23 pool-playing years (she began pocketing balls, pre-kindergarten, on the obligatory basement table), Brooklyn's &quot;Queen Jean&quot; has feasted on women's competition. She won her first national title in '73 at age 13 and has dropped maybe a half-dozen matches since then. Steamrolling the ladies amounts to a decent living (about $25,000 in tournament prize money in '86), but it's just not gratifying anymore. That's why, promoters willing, Ms. Balukas is once again aiming her $2,000 custom cue toward both the men's and women's divisions. Not all her opponents are thrilled with the prospect.    &quot;She wins all the women's money and then comes in to play us,&quot; says Allen Hopkins, another former world champion (1977). &quot;What about all the guys who have no chance in the men's -- why can't they be allowed in the women's, 'just for the experience?'&quot; he asks.    &quot;If they want to lower themselves a few notches, fine,&quot; answers Ms. Balukas. &quot;The quality of men's play is far superior. I'm trying to realize my own potential as a player, not just as a woman player. I'm not out here to drill the men.&quot;    She could have fooled her next Chicago opponent, &quot;Spanish Mike&quot; LeBron. The two cut a striking contrast at the table: the sallow, middle-aged Mr. LeBron, a figure out of the era of spittoons when poolrooms were a male refuge from female-imposed gentility; the ruddy and athletic Ms. Balukas, clean-cut as a tennis prodigy. The crusher was a poor shot selection by Mr. LeBron, a missed cross-side bank late in the match that allowed Ms. Balukas, by this time controlling the cue ball as if on a string, an easy finish. Mr. LeBron watched impassively as she cleared the table. Click-plop, click-plop, click-plop.    &quot;Personally, it wouldn't particularly bother me losing to her,&quot; said an approving fellow player, Grady &quot;The Professor&quot; Mathews, after the match. &quot;I don't like to lose, period. Whom I lose to makes little difference. But I think she's great for the game,&quot; he said. The Professor is an erudite and bespectacled stickman whose most prominent loss was as a player/actor to Paul Newman in the film, &quot;The Color of Money.&quot;    Most of the pool fraternity cared little for &quot;Money&quot; -- too unauthentic, too many bogus phrases such as, &quot;you're gonna choke,&quot; or &quot;you hustled me,&quot; that would draw howls in any self-respecting poolroom. Jean Balukas disliked the film for her own reasons. &quot;It didn't have much good to say about the sport,&quot; she says. &quot;They love to show the bad side of everything. I guess that's the movies.&quot;    In real life, Ms. Balukas has tried, with difficulty, to ignore the game's darker side. She doesn't gamble, which, even as a woman, is an outright rarity for her level of stick talent. &quot;I don't like that aspect of pool, or the atmosphere -- setting up games for a thousand dollars here and there. I'd be dealing with people I don't even care to be talking to,&quot; she says indignantly. In the past, she's turned down more than one offer to go on the road. &quot;No thank you,&quot; she politely answers the would-be partners and profiteers.    &quot;Little David&quot; Howard was the cad who eventually bumped her from the Chicago tourney. He spoke later of a chink in her armor that may be a direct result of clean living. &quot;You could tell she's never had the pressure of gambling, the way she missed a couple of banks, rollin' the ball, instead of punchin' it the way we would,&quot; he explained. &quot;I'd never seen her dog it till then.&quot;    Against the women at the same tournament, Ms. Balukas stormed through her bracket before edging former Playboy bunny Eva Mataya in the final. The spectators, who had previously cheered Ms. Balukas on against the men, now openly backed her opponent, who played exceptionally, despite losing. &quot;I think we're going to have a great rivalry,&quot; Ms. Balukas graciously offered afterward. &quot;I just wish she wasn't so darned pretty. Everyone pulls for her.&quot;    Then it was home to Brooklyn, to Bay Ridge Billiards in Brooklyn, an establishment her father opened to keep her older brothers out of the city's pool halls. It remains a clean, well-lighted place, a family joint with gold-clothed tables. Ms. Balukas insists that the venture had nothing to do with her precocity. &quot;But if he'd opened a driving range or a bowling alley,&quot; she says, almost wistfully, &quot;I would have probably been a pro golfer or a pro bowler.&quot; Any doubters can consider her three consecutive second-place finishes (behind speed-skating gold medalist Anne Henning) at the '77-'79 Superstars, where she likes to recall being treated &quot;like a celebrity, like I was somebody.&quot;    --   Mr. Stravinsky is a free-lance sports writer based in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
