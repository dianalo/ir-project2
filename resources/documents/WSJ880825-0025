But until she learns more about him, &quot;I don't feel that would be a wise choice.&quot;    In the wake of Mr. Bush's triumphal assumption of the Republican presidential mantle at the GOP national convention, a new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that the vice president has staged a stunning comeback: He has surged to a 47%-to-40% lead among likely voters, compared with a 10-point deficit in a Journal/NBC poll conducted two weeks earlier, just before the convention. Among all registered voters, Mr. Bush now holds a five-point lead.    Even more striking than the vice president's gains in the trial-heat aspect of the poll are the sharp improvements in voters' perceptions of him. The percentage of people with a generally favorable opinion of him has climbed to 57% from 47% two weeks ago. Even more important, the percentage of people holding an unfavorable opinion of him declined from 43% -- a dangerous level for a politician -- to a much more acceptable 30%. At their current levels, Mr. Bush's ratings are virtually identical to Mr. Dukakis's.    Moreover, the poll indicates that Mr. Bush now is seen as a stronger leader than Mr. Dukakis, an area in which the Democrat previously enjoyed an edge. And significantly more of likely voters -- a margin of 53% to 37% -- say they would rather have Mr. Bush in the Oval Office in case of a sudden crisis that required swift, decisive action; in previous Journal/NBC polls, the two candidates had been closely matched on that question.    If there is a caveat for Mr. Bush in the poll, it is his selection of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle to be his running mate. By a margin of 2 to 1, likely voters think Democratic nominee Lloyd Bentsen would make a better president than Sen. Quayle if events required it, and a plurality believe the GOP nominee received special treatment to get into the National Guard in 1969. New Jersey resident William Bergen, a 45-year-old bank officer, Vietnam veteran and conservative Republican, says that if Mr. Quayle got in &quot;because he's wealthy, that disappoints me.&quot; He adds: &quot;I'm not wealthy, I couldn't do it. . . . I don't think I can take to somebody who takes shortcuts like that.&quot;    To better gauge the attitudes underlying the shifting poll numbers, pollster Peter Hart one night this week brought together Mr. Treene, Ms. Molis, Mr. Bergen and nine other voters from the middle-class and working-class communities in and around this suburban township to discuss the presidential campaign for The Wall Street Journal.    These 12 New Jerseyites aren't a scientific sample of the electorate. Rather, they were chosen as examples of &quot;swing&quot; voters, those critical up-for-grabs voters who aren't firmly committed to either candidate. Such voters include Democrats who supported President Reagan in 1984 and still generally approve of his performance, strictly independent voters, and Democrats and Republicans who haven't yet decided who they want this year -- segments that, combined, make up about a quarter of the electorate.    To these voters, George Bush has managed to climb out of Ronald Reagan's shadow and onto his shoulders, conveying the notion that he is a logical successor to, and not just a follower of, the president. By contrast, Michael Dukakis, despite his strong performance at his own convention, still hasn't succeeded in sharply conveying to these people who he is and what he stands for.    &quot;For these voters, the burden of responsibility has clearly shifted,&quot; says Mr. Hart, who led the discussion and is a Democrat who isn't involved in this year's campaign. &quot;For George Bush, a whole lot of pluses are now coming out, issues of experience and continuity. For Michael Dukakis to do well, he is going to have to make a stronger case for change, and a case for his credentials to be in the Oval Office.&quot;    These swing voters tend to be middle-class, middle-income, not strongly partisan, a little more wary of change than the electorate as a whole. In that regard, they see Vice President Bush as representing continuity with an economic climate that has so far been pretty good to them. Tom Dobkowski, a 23-year-old carpenter and Reagan Democrat, fears that an economic change of course could push interest rates sharply higher, discouraging the construction that provides his livelihood. And Jeannine Larsen, a 52-year-old homemaker who is married to a certified public accountant, observes: &quot;I don't think a new broom necessarily sweeps clean.&quot;    The New Orleans convention, says Mr. Treene, &quot;helped propel Bush into his own. I think it was partly due to his speech; I think it was partly due to the role that Ronald Reagan played initially, leaving the helm of the convention to Mr. Bush, which was almost a passing over of the responsibility.&quot;    Yet this group unanimously regards Mr. Bush much more as an interested observer than active participant in the Reagan administration's accomplishments, and several members aren't yet fully convinced about him. In the nationwide poll, Mr. Bush got only marginally more credit for some of the administration's successes and less blame for its failings than in the pre-convention poll.    In the discussion group here, some of the doubts about the vice president were fueled by the Quayle selection. Mr. Bergen, the bank officer, says he is &quot;not as thrilled {about Mr. Bush} as before he picked Quayle.&quot; Janice Hymanson, a Reagan Democrat who has gone back to school in middle age to study art, cites GOP Sen. Robert Dole's less-than-enthusiastic words of support for Sen. Quayle as &quot;a rather strong commentary on the selection.&quot; And David Dougherty, a 25-year-old courier and Republican, says: &quot;It's important to me. I think the Bush people should have given it a little more consideration.&quot;    But Mr. Dobkowski, who is a Navy Reservist, observes: &quot;He may have had a little help, but any job you get, you get help from someone.&quot; And Donna Misdom, a 36-year-old secretary and political independent who voted for President Reagan and now is undecided, believes that Mr. Quayle is being unfairly &quot;picked on by the news media.&quot;    She likes the fact that he is &quot;a baby boomer,&quot; someone of her own generation. With youth, she says &quot;comes some fresh ideas,&quot; adding: &quot;There's nothing wrong with the fact that he chose not to carry a gun through the mud. He served in another way.&quot;    Despite voters' greater confidence in Sen. Bentsen in the nationwide Journal/NBC poll, they still approve of Mr. Quayle's selection by a margin of 45% to 28%. In addition, two-thirds don't believe the senator's military-service record should be an issue in the campaign; interestingly, twice as many liberals as conservatives believe it should be an issue.    According to the survey, Mr. Bush all but obliterated the &quot;gender gap&quot; that has plagued him through the campaign -- the fact that far more women have preferred the Democratic nominee. Two weeks ago, Mr. Dukakis led among women likely voters by 19 percentage points; in the latest survey, Mr. Bush was ahead by four points. In fact, the Democrat now suffers from a gender gap of his own: Where he had been tied with Mr. Bush among men, he now trails by 12 points.    The survey shows that the vice president now leads in the South and West, two regions that are GOP strongholds, while the candidates are basically neck and neck in the East and Midwest. And better than four in 10 voters now consider Mr. Dukakis a liberal; as recently as June the figure was 30%. Perhaps as a result, the vice president has reduced Mr. Dukakis's lead among Democrats who voted for Mr. Reagan in 1984 to 12 points from 34 points two weeks ago.    In the New Jersey discussion group, the view of Mr. Dukakis seems curiously muted. Ms. Molis has a perception of the Democratic nominee as someone who's &quot;ready to go,&quot; but she isn't sure where he's ready to go to. &quot;I want to know more about him,&quot; she says several times. Ms. Misdom agrees: &quot;I haven't read too much on Dukakis's stand on the issues,&quot; she says.    Several of the voters who might lean toward Mr. Bush right now say they remain convincible about Gov. Dukakis. But even some who are more positive about Mr. Dukakis express their views in terms of dissatisfaction with the way things are going now, rather than with strong enthusiasm for the candidate himself. &quot;It's time for a change, and I feel that Bush will just follow in Ronald Reagan's footsteps,&quot; says Ernest Dubay, 63, a Democrat and a retired school principal.    When asked what one thing they would want to be able to say about Mr. Dukakis at the end of a Dukakis administration, the answers vary. The same is generally true for George Bush. But Mr. Bergen, still thinking about Dan Quayle, wants most to say in 1992 about a President Bush: &quot;He didn't die.&quot;    ---   &quot;In general, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of . . .&quot;                         8/5-8/8                      George Bush   Favorable ............................ 47%   Unfavorable .......................... 43%                    Michael Dukakis   Favorable ............................ 55%   Unfavorable .......................... 26%                       8/20-8/22                      George Bush   Favorable ............................ 57%   Unfavorable .......................... 30%                    Michael Dukakis   Favorable ............................ 55%   Unfavorable .......................... 29%   The Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll</TEXT></DOC>
