ROTSTEIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AssociatedPress Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TUBA CITY, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An agreement short of adoption has beenstruck in the case of a Navajo baby that will lead to permanentguardianship by a non-Indian San Jose, Calif., couple andvisitation rights by the mother.   In the end, all parties agreed, it was Baby Allyssa who won.   The agreement struck Friday among Navajo officials, PatriciaKeetso and Rick and Cheryl Pitts of San Jose, Calif., granted thecouple temporary custody of the 9-month-old Navajo daughter of Ms.Keetso pending tribal court proceedings to give them permanentguardianship.   Under it, Ms. Keetso will retain her parental and visitationrights, and the tribe's concern that Allyssa be given anidentification with her Navajo heritage and culture will beassured, said Anslem Roanhorse, director of the Navajo Division ofSocial Welfare.   Tribal authorities also gave it their approval, after 4{ hoursof negotiations involving Navajo Tribal Children's Judge ManuelWatchman, lawyers, a legal advocate for the child, tribal socialwelfare officials and others.   ``I feel wonderful,'' Pitts told reporters, saying the effortthat had begun as an adoption proceeding in California``definitely'' was worth going through.   ``The anguish and pain and confusion felt, I'm sure, by thePittses, the natural mother, the family members have hopefully cometo an end,'' said Roanhorse. ``Perhaps now the healing process canbegin.''   Roanhorse said the case set a precedent in upholding the rightsof extended family members.   Pitts expressed satisfaction with the compromise, which he said``was nothing more than our original intentions.''   Mrs. Pitts said, ``I think things could have been done in adifferent way if somebody had just listened to us,'' but added thatshe was not bitter and was happy to be going home ``with ourdaughter.''   Attorney Michael C. Nelson, who represented the Pitts couple andMs. Keetso, said permanent guardianship means the Pittses'relationship with Allyssa Keetso's biological mother would not haveto end, as it would under adoption.   However, Nelson said, once the permanent guardianship isgranted, Ms. Keetso would not be able to come back and claimcustody of the child. Guardianship proceedings will begin withinthe next four months, he added.   The agreement grants liberal visitation rights to the biologicalmother and other members of the baby's extended Indian family.   The Pittses, both 33, were in the process of adopting Allyssawith the approval of Ms. Keetso when the Navajo Tribal Courtsintervened. Federal law gives tribal courts jurisdiction over theadoption of Indian children by non-Indians in certain instances.   Nelson said the couple wanted to adopt Allyssa and give hermother visitation rights, but tribal officials say adoption wouldsever the child's link with the tribe. Navajo law places strongemphasis on extended family.   Under a guardianship, parental rights would remain with thebiological mother even though the Pittses would raise the child.The couple would be legally considered the parents if they adoptthe child.   Ms. Keetso, 21, was pregnant and single when she contacted thePittses through a newspaper ad. She lived with the San Jose,Calif., couple for two months before and one month after Allyssawas born and said she wanted the couple to adopt her daughter.   The child's maternal grandmother, Susie Keetso, also has saidshe wants the child to be turned over to the San Jose couple.   Tribal officials have said they intervened after Mrs. Keetsoexpressed ``strong interest'' in having the child raised at thereservation. But earlier this week, Mrs. Keetso said she had beenthreatened with jail if she did not allow the tribe to intervene inthe case.</TEXT></DOC>
