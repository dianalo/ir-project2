TheIRS said Friday that it needs more time to study the plan, and that it willnot be put into effect before next year's April's deadline. Under theproposal, the 80 percent of taxpayers who qualify for refunds could file theirreturns anytime before midnight Aug. 15. Present law allows that extensiononly for those who file Form 4868 requesting it.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  IRS DELAYS PUSHING BACK TAX DEADLINE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Financial Digest  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff and Wire Reports  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910817  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  13F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  88  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday August 17, 199100230179,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
