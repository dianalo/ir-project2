Macey, of CornellUniversity Law School, and Geoffrey P. Miller, of the University of ChicagoLaw School. Copies of the report are available from the Office of the Chairmanof the Administrative Conference.The Administrative Conference of the United States is an independent federalagency, established to promote improvements in the efficiency, adequacyand fairness of governmental processes (5 U.S.C. 571-576). In 1987, theConference established the Special Committee on Financial Services to examineissues relating to procedural fairness and efficiency in the U.S. financialservices industry. The Committee has taken up several issues, includingthe adjudication practices and procedures of the federal bank regulatorysgencies, the Federal Reserve Board's handling of applications under theBank Holding Company Act, and the resolution of claims against savingsreceiverships.The Committee currently is examining the enforcement powers of the federalbank regulatory agencies; the informal audit and settlement practices ofthe bank regulatory agencies; and the role of those agencies in enforcingthe Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the subject of thedraft recommendation set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="85">Draft Recommendation: Agency Administration of Failed or Failing DepositoryInstitutions</ITAG>Special Committee on Financial Services<ITAG tagnum="81">Introduction</ITAG>Not since the Great Depression has there been such concern about the fundamentalstability of the U.S. banking industry. The apparent decline in publicconfidence stems from the unprecedented increase in the incidence of bankfailures in the past decade and also from the heavy losses in the insurancefunds overseen by the bank and thrift regulatory agencies that were designedto protect depositors from losses in such failures. One hundred twentybanks failed in 1985; 145 failed in 1986; 184 failed in 1987; and 200 failedin 1988.The situation is even more grave in the savings and loan industry, in whicha wave of failures and insolvencies has led to the passage of costly legislationto bail out failed thrifts which revamped the regulatory structure by abolishingthe Federal Home Loan Bank Board and placing the replenished thrift insurancefund under the control of the banking regulators of the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation.The large stake that the Federal Government has in the finanical stabilityof depository institutions, as well as the current system of regulationthat imposes many of the costs of depository institution failures on thegeneral public, suggest that the administrative procedures used by theFederal bank regulatory agencies in administering failed or failing depositoryinstitutions warrant special attention. For the purposes of this discussion,the federal bank regulatory agencies that may be involved in administeringfailed or failing institutions include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,the Office of Thrift Supervision in the Department of the Treasury, theNational Credit Union Administration, and the Farm Credit Administration.Other fedeal agencies such as the Comptroller of the Currency and the FederalReserve Board do not administer failed institutions <T3>per se,</T3> but play an important role in approving mergers and acquisitionsof institutions.The federal bank regulatory agencies use a variety of different methodsfor administering failed or failing depository institutions. The followingmethods used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are illustrative:<T3>Payoff and liquidation. </T3>In a straight liquidation of a bank thathas been declared insolvent, the FDIC, acting in its corporate capacity,pays off insured depositors. In its capaicty as receiver of an insuredclosed bank, the FDIC acts as trustee of the insolvent estate for the benefitof creditors, including the FDIC insurance fund. To the extent that fundsare disbursed to insured depositors, the FDIC assumes the rights of suchdepositors as creditors. As receiver, the FDIC liquidates the bank's assetsfor the benefit of all creditors, including the insurance fund.<T3>Modified payoffs. </T3>In a modified payoff, the FDIC makes full paymentsto insured depositors and partial payments to uninsured depositors, basedon the FDIC's estimate of the proceeds from liquidation of the failed bank.The FDIC then liquidates the institution, and any excess is paid over tothe uninsured depositors and other bank creditors.<T3>Purchase-and-assumption transactions. </T3>In a purchase-and-assumption(P andamp; A) transaction, deposit accounts and certain other liabilitiesof the failed depository institution are assumed by another institution,which also purchases some of the failed institution's assets. Thus, sucha transaction essentially involves the merger of a failed institution intoa solvent one. Usually only performing assets (that is, loans that arebeing paid off) are purchased. Any shortfall between the value of the assetspurchased and the value of the liabilities assumed is made up by the FDIC.The FDIC as receiver generally purchases all poor and non-performing assetsand seeks to collect on those assets to offset its losses.<T3>Open bank assistance. </T3>Before a troubled bank has been formallydeclared insolvent, the FDIC may, in certain circumstances, provide itwith direct financial assistance to prevent it from failing. The FDIC alsohas authority to purchase a bank's bad loans and to buy its preferred stockor other securities (not including common stock).<T3>Bridge banks. </T3>Under powers granted by the Competitive EqualityBanking Act of 1987, the FDIC may establish bridge banks, which purchasethe assets and assume the deposits and certain other liabilities of thefailed institution and continue to provide banking services. Such bridgebanks may be operated for three years (an original two-year term, withthe possibility of a one-year extension). Bridge banks are not requiredto have any capital and receive operating funds from the FDIC, as the Boardof Directors deems ``necessary or advisable.'' The bridge banks allowsthe FDIC more time to facilitate an acquisition.The FDIC and the other agencies involved in administering failed or failinginstitutions should keep the following objectives in mind when selectingmethods and procedures:<T3>Minimizing the cost to the deposit insurance funds. </T3>In determininga procedure for handling a depository institution failure, the agency shouldconsider which method will result in the least cost to the Federal insurancefunds. No two insolvencies are identical. It is essential that the agencyevaluate each failure on a case-by-case basis and not rule out any particularprocedure because of possibly unfavorable experiences in the past. Wheremethods that involve full payouts to uninsured depositors are considered,the goal of minimizing the burden on the insurance funds can only be accomplishedif the agency weighs the expected benefits of such procedures, includingthe potentially increased stability of the banking system as a whole, againstthe costs of such procedures, including the additional drain on the depositinsurance funds and the potential loss of market discipline in the formof monitoring by large uninsured depositors and other creditors. Open bankassistance, in particular, needs to be used with caution because of therisk that a depository institution will eventually fail, notwithstandingthe infusion of new capital.<T3>Protecting small depositors. </T3>Because small depositors may findit more difficult than large depositors to obtain access to funds duringthe interim period between bank failure and repayment, the agency shouldremain sensitive to their need to obtain early access to their funds duringthe liquidation process, for example, by expediting payments to small depositorswho may have to make home mortgage, tuition or other highly time-sensitivepayments.<T3>Ensuring efficient auctions for failed institutions. </T3>The processby which the agency determines who is eligible to bid at an auction fora failed depository institution is not clearly delineated. The agency conductingthe auction normally does not give general public notice of impending auctions,but instead selectively contacts potential bidders. For example, establishedinstitutions are sometimes the only entities to participate in FDIC-managedauctions, while individual entrepreneurs and other potential bidders whomight enter the industry by bidding on an insolvent bank are sometimesexcluded. The reduction in the number of bidders may lower the amount paidfor a failed bank, thus further straining the federal deposit insurancefunds. On the other hand, selectivity in designating bidders may tend toweed out unreliable or inexperienced operators who might drive the institutioninto failure once again. Speedy actions may also be desirable in orderto maintain public confidence in the banking system and ensure that insureddepositors are paid off as rapidly as possible. The agencies might benefitfrom further study of alternatives available to auction procedures in orderto weigh the costs and benefits of the existing system against the potentialcosts and benefits of increasing the number of bidders at auctions forfailed depository institutions.The acquisition of banking institutions while still solvent can forestallpotential insolvencies. Thus the procedures for regulating such acquisitionsdeserve examination as part of the overall problem of how the Federal bankregulatory agencies proceed in the administration of failing institutions.At present parties wishing to acquire a solvent depository institutionmust comply with a highly complex set of rules. The complexity and longlead time required for such acquisitions are potential deterrents to friendlyas well as unfriendly acquisitions.Three statutes control takeover activity for commercial banks:<T3>The Change in Bank Control Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(i)) </T3>makes it impossiblefor someone to take control of a commercial bank without prior regulatoryreview. The Act prevents any person from acquiring control of an FDIC-insuredbank, unless the appropriate Federal bank regulatory agency has been given60 days' prior written notice of the proposed acquisition, although theFDIC frequently exercises its authority to reduce or extend this time limitation.Except as provided by regulation of the appropriate agency, the Changein Bank Control Act also requires that the acquiror disclose to the agencysignificant information about itself and the proposed acquisition, includingits identity and the identity of each entity on whose behalf the acquisitionis being made, and any strategic plans regarding disposition of the acquiredbank.<T3>The Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)) </T3>requires the prior approvalof the relevant Federal bank regulatory agency before one bank may mergeor consolidate with another bank. In addition, the agency must notify theAttorney General and other bank regulatory agencies of the proposed transaction.These agencies must prepare reports on the competitive factors involvedin the proposed merger.<T3>The Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1842) </T3>governs bank acquisitionsby corporations, including bank holding companies. A corporation or bankholding company must obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Board toacquire more than twenty-five percent or more of a bank's stock (or wherethe Board determines that control will exist), to acquire all or substantiallyall of a bank's assets, or to merge or consolidate with another bank holdingcompany. A minimum of 30 days' notice to the regulator is required beforeapproval of a transaction may be given. Thus, the Act grants the FederalReserve Board considerable power over certain proposed takeovers of banksby bank holding companies and other corporations.Under this regulatory structure, every transfer of control of an insuredbank involves regulatory review or approval under varying criteria anduncertain time frames. By increasing the costs of acquiring banks, thisstructure might reduce the incentives of prospective bidders to engagein monitoring activities that serve the desirable goal of identifying undervaluedand mismanaged banks. On the other hand, Congress established this regulatorystructure in order to accomplish policy objectives that may require someimpediments to bank takeovers as compared with firms in other fields. Thereis no justification, however, for procedures that deter bank takeoversif such procedures are not reasonably related to countervailing policyconcerns. Similarly, there is no justification for inconsistent or non-uniformpolicies and procedures for the approval of proposed mergers.Accordingly, Congress should authorized \1\<NOTE/> the Federal bank regulatory agencies to consider establishingan interagency task force to rationalize and streamline the process forchanges in bank control by merger, acquisition, or any other means, bothin hostile and friendly situations. Such an interagency task force shouldhave the goal of rationalizing and streamlining the bank acquisition, changein control and merger process. Clear and consistent rules among agencieswould provide greater certainty to potential bidders and targets as totheir legal rights and obligations. If appropriate, the task force shouldrecommend legislative solutions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Although such a task force could be established withoutthe need for legislation, legislation would likely facilitate the agencyprocess.Recommendation<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Procedures for Administering Failed or Failing Depository Institutions</ITAG>1. Federal bank regulatory agencies should not display a general preferencefor any particular method of administering failed or failing depositoryinstitutions. Instead, all strategies should be evaluated in light of thefacts and circumstances of each case, in order to ensure safer and morecompetent management, preserve the insurance funds, and maintain speedof insured deposit payoffs.2. In determining procedures for dealing with failed or failing depositoryinstitutions, the Federal bank regulatory agencies should consider theextent to which protecting uninsured depositors might impose unnecessarycosts on the insurance funds and reduce institutional incentives to avoidexcessive risk-taking.3. Before granting open bank assistance, the relevant Federal bank regulatoryagency should: (1) Determine that there is a substantial probability thatthe institution will return to profitable operations within a reasonabletime; (2) determine that the total costs of the open bank assistance willclearly be lower than the costs of any alternative procedure; (3) insistas a prerequisite to such assistance that the depository institution alsoreceive a significant infusion of capital from non-government sources;and (4) ordinarily require replacement of top management, unless the agencyconcludes that the problems of the depository institution were clearlybeyond the control or influence of such management.4. The relevant Federal bank regulatory agencies should study the processby which ownership of failed institutions is transferred to outside buyers.Specifically, the agencies should weigh the costs and benefits of (a) extendingthe length of time for bidding for the assets of failed institutions, and(b) ensuring that all eligible parties are notified and given an opportunityto bid.<ITAG tagnum="81">II. Protection of Small Depositors</ITAG>The Federal bank regulatory agencies should be sensitive to the needs ofsmall, insured depositors in failed depository institutions who need immediateaccess to funds to make home mortgage payments, tuition payments or otherhighly time-sensitive obligations.<ITAG tagnum="81">III. Procedures for Administering Acquisitions of Solvent Institutions</ITAG>1. The Federal bank regulatory agencies should review their proceduresfor approving acquisitions or other ownership changes of solvent depositoryinstitutions in order to streamline such procedures and provide potentialacquirors and targets with clear guidelines regarding the approval process.2. Congress should authorize the Federal bank reglatory agencies to establishan interagency task force to review and evaluate acquisition, change incontrol, and merger applications in order to shorten, harmonize and rationalizesuch procedures for both hostile and friendly situations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffrey S.
