(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A computer hacker has breachedlower-level security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory forthe 11th time in a week, officials said.   The latest intrusion into the system took place Saturday, the labannounced Monday.   So far, the hacker has managed to invade the unclassifiedresearch computer systems at the lab at least 11 times during thepast week.   There have been no new intrusions since the weekend, Chuck Cole,chief of the nuclear weapons facility, said through a spokesman.   The spokesman, Ronald Teunis, said Cole could not commentdirectly because he was ``exhausted'' from the hectic weeklonginvasion of the computer systems by the mysterious hacker.   Cole had issued a public invitation to the hacker or hackers lastSaturday, asking to be contacted directly ``so I can see what hewants.''   Teunis said Cole has received several telephone calls from peopleoffering to help, but none was believed to be the hacker.   He said the system involved is the UNIX network, which linksresearch labs and universities around the nation. The network, usedfor unclassified scientific research, was the one invaded last monthby a computer virus believed released by a Cornell Universitygraduate student.   The Livermore hacker has not invaded the lab's highly secretnuclear weapons research computers, which are physically andelectronically separated from the unclassified system.   Teunis said the hacker has not destroyed or altered anyinformation in the files, although the hacker apparently has thecapability of doing so.   Cole emphasized earlier that the attacks do not involve a virus,a program that invades a computer system and can clog its memorysystem by overreproduction.</TEXT></DOC>
