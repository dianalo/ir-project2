The issues have surfaced repeatedly at the agency's generalconferences in recent years and figure on the current meeting'sagenda as ``Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat'' and ``SouthAfrica nuclear capabilities.''   In his opening address, director-general Hans Blix saidpromotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy is hampered byexcessive public concern about radiation from nuclear powerstations.   The head of the U.S. delegation, Secretary of Energy James D.Watkins, warned that regaining public confidence in nuclear powercould not be achieved solely by promoting new designs and promisingenhanced safety.   ``I am absolutely convinced that the key ... is a positive trackrecord of operational safety,'' by the owners and operators ofnuclear facilities, Watkins said.   Last year, the agency's annual conference adopted a resolutionsponsored by Arab states condemning Israel's nuclear policies.   The resolution denounced ``Israel's refusal to renounce thepossession of nuclear weapons'' and demanded that it place itsnuclear facilities under agency control.   The conference also will discuss a resolution supported byAfrican nations to suspend South Africa's membership rights.Pretoria has not sent a delegation to the general conference since1979 when its credentials were not accepted for the meeting.   South Africa's refusal to submit its nuclear facilities tointernational inspection and refusal to sign the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty has prompted repeated calls fromdeveloping countries for its ouster.   Under the 1969 treaty, which has been signed by 140 governments,countries pledge to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposesand open their nuclear facilities to inspection by experts of theVienna-based energy agency.   Two known atomic powers, France and China, have not signed thetreaty although they submit their peaceful nuclear facilities tointernational inspection.   Some countries thought to possess the potential of producingnuclear weapons, including India, Pakistan, Israel, Libya as wellas South Africa, have also not signed the treaty.   Blix said the agency recently received a Soviet proposal on theestablishment of a center for international reasearch at Chernobyl,the site of a major nuclear power accident in 1986.   A second Soviet proposal calls for an international project inwaste disposal research at an undisclosed site in the Soviet Union.   The conference, which ends Friday, is scheduled to approve a$162.8 million budget and also will be asked to approve $45.5million for voluntary contributions toward the agency'stechnological assistance program.</TEXT></DOC>
