The gain in the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators, the largest since a 1% jump in July, partly reflects a surge in prices for sensitive materials, a category that includes a wide range of market-sensitive commodities. Department officials said prices rose substantially for waste paper, raw cotton and aluminum scrap. Excluding those sensitive materials, the index rose 0.3%.    The October rise followed a revised 0.2% increase in September and a revised 0.2% drop in August. The department previously reported a 0.4% rise in September and a 0.1% decline in August.    Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that non-farm productivity rose at an anemic 0.2% annual rate in the third quarter, the same as the department had predicted in a preliminary report issued in October.    &quot;It would take a rosy-eyed optimist to predict that a breakout is imminent,&quot; said Roger Brinner, director of U.S. forecasting at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. He characterized the increase in the index of leading indicators, excluding materials prices, as &quot;average or small.&quot;    Nevertheless, Mr. Brinner contended the report contained some signs of strength, pointing to a drop in initial claims for unemployment insurance and an increase in the number of companies receiving slower deliveries from suppliers. &quot;The economy is in less precarious shape than it was two months ago,&quot; he said.    Martin Mauro, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York, said, &quot;The index is not as as strong as it might appear.&quot; He noted that several of the indicators that contributed to the index's increase were so-called financial indicators, such as materials prices, the money supply and a rise in credit outstanding.    &quot;The manufacturing sector still looks sluggish and without a turnaround in manufacturing we can't expect a significant turnaround in the overall economy,&quot; he said. Indicators that declined included the average workweek, contracts and orders for plant and equipment and orders for consumer goods.    Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige was more optimistic. In a statement, he said that the &quot;sharp improvement in initial claims for unemployment insurance was especially encouraging and should mean faster growth in employment.&quot;    Noting that the index rose at an annual pace of 2.5% over the past six months, Mr. Baldrige acknowledged that it probably has to increase more rapidly before the economy's growth rate will accelerate. But he said he anticipates a pickup, particularly in new orders, partly as a result of improvement in the trade balance.    The rise in cotton prices followed a steep drop the month before after a cut in government price supports. All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variation.    The October rise in the index brought it to 180.5% of its 1967 average from 179.5% the month before.    The department's index of coincident indicators, which tend to rise and fall with economic activity, increased 0.4% in October to 166% of its 1967 average after rising 0.4% in September to 165.4%.    The index of lagging indicators, which tend to trail economic trends, rose 1% in October to 132.8% of its 1967 average after falling 0.2% in September to 131.5%. The ratio of coincident to lagging indicators, which some analysts believe signals turning points in the economy in advance of the leading indicators, fell to 1.25 from 1.26.    The latest productivity figure, a measure of output per hour worked, continues a trend of sluggish growth, a Labor Department economist said. Productivity climbed at a 0.5% annual rate in the second quarter.    The revised 0.2% annual growth rate in the third quarter reflects a 3% increase in output and a 2.8% increase in hours worked. The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations. The second-quarter gain resulted from a revised 0.6% rise in output and a revised 0.1% increase in hours worked.    The current business recovery has lasted four years, making it relatively long-lasting compared with most previous postwar expansions. Productivity generally rises sharply in the early stages of a business recovery, as companies increase output faster than they hire new workers. It then tapers off in the later stages as output slows relative to the number of workers.    The department also said that productivity for nonfinancial companies increased at a 0.3% annual rate in the third quarter, a preliminary estimate. The estimate is based on an increase in output of 1.4% and an increase in hours worked of 1.1%. This was the first quarter in which productivity increased in the nonfinancial sector since the third quarter of 1985.    The final figures on third-quarter productivity in the manufacturing and business sectors varied only slightly from earlier estimates. Productivity increased at a 3.7% annual rate in the manufacturing sector compared with the 4.2% preliminary estimate. And in the business sector, productivity increased at a 0.2% annual rate, nearly the same as the 0.1% rate published in October.    Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After various adjustments, they produced a 0.6% rise in the index for October and a 0.2% rise for September.                                         Oct.
