Garten's thoughtful essay on the unwillingnessof Germany and Japan to share international security burdens(&quot;Allies Who Fail Us,&quot; editorial page, March 29)underestimates the profound psychological scars of the Germanand Japanese people as the result of having lost major warsin this century.   We can put ourselves in their shoes by reflecting on thefact that the American people are only now emerging from thecrisis of confidence that befell us after suffering a minordefeat in a minor war. Even President Bush hesitated in thefirst days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, asserting theU.S. would not use force to rectify the situation. He waspermitted to use force by only a narrow majority of the U.S.Senate, which is controlled by the political party that tookthis country into Vietnam at a time when it was feeling greatconfidence as an international force for good.</LP><TEXT>   In this way, nation-states are not much different frommembers of families. Those sons and daughters who have beensystematic losers in life have to rebuild their confidence bydoing first what they do best. Germany and Japan are betterat economic growth than in winning wars, and it should be nosurprise they'd like to stick to their knitting.   Before we can expect them to play an active role in the&quot;new world order,&quot; the U.S. and its allies must be morespecific on what the new world order is all about. Does itmean every time a sadistic dictator invades his neighbor theU.S. sends 500,000 troops to police the scene, levying taxeson the rest of the world to cover the costs? Is there anyeconomic component to the new world order? If there is,President Bush has yet to spell it out.   Within the U.S., our &quot;order&quot; has been worked out as amatter of jurisdiction, at least where security is concerned.If the local police can't handle a situation, police fromneighboring districts are called in. If that is insufficient,the National Guard is called in. If the Guard can't handlethe matter, federal authorities, the FBI, even the Army, thenbecome available.   It will take at least another generation and more likelyanother century to work out these jurisdictional nicetiesamong the community of nations. It's premature to belittleGermany and Japan, taunting them for not signing onimmediately for a journey about which so little is known.   Jude Wanniski   President   Polyconomics Inc.
