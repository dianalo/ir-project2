In the '90s, they will turntheir attention to the genetics of human behavior.   In human genes, the basic units of heredity, scientists may findthe roots of such complex disorders as manic-depressive illness andschizophrenia. Unlike simpler ailments studied so far, these arethe result of more than one genetic malfunction.   It will take more than 10 years to understand ``the molecularnature of our emotional life,'' said Philip Leder, chairman of thegenetics department at Harvard Medical School. But understanding ofsome behavioral disorders should come by the year 2000, he said.   ``We know a number of these run in families,'' he said. ``Wedon't know what genes are involved in that process. They haven'tbeen identified yet. But there is the possibility that with genemapping we will be able to sort them out.''   Gene mapping is the process of sorting through human chromosomesto find the particular genes related to a particular disorder.   Heart disease and cancer, the nation's two leading killers, arealso caused in part by multiple genetic abnormalities. They, too,may begin to yield to the rapidly expanding capabilities ofgeneticists, Leder said.   ``There are very few diseases that afflict man or mouse that arenot genetic in one way or another,'' Leder said recently at agathering of geneticists at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor,Maine.   By the end of the 1990s, researchers should be closer to acomplete, chemical-by-chemical understanding of some of theseailments, said Leder, one of the inventors of the geneticallyengineered mouse that became, in April 1988, the first animal to bepatented.   David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, shares Leder's optimistic view of the next decade.   ``The fast pace of molecular biology shows no sign of slowingdown,'' he wrote recently.   Baltimore said studies of the central nervous system are showingthat nerve cells respond to signals in nearly the same way thatkidney cells respond to hormones or skin cells respond to growthfactors.   ``I think this will be a tremendously exciting field in the next10 years, one that will not only stimulate discoveries in neurologyand lead to new treatments for Alzheimer's disease and otherdegenerative brain diseases but also greatly enrich the fields ofpsychiatry and psychology,'' he wrote.   The growing biotechnology industry, where basic research isbeginning to be translated into products, has also issued glowingpredictions for the 1990s.   The industry's total sales exceeded $2 billion last year. Thatis expected to climb to $50 billion by the turn of the century,according to an industry survey by the Ernst and Young HighTechnology Group in New York.   One of the most notable efforts of the coming decade is theso-called Human Genome Project, a $3 billion program to determinethe genetic code, or sequence, of all the estimated 50,000 to100,000 genes that govern human hereditary characteristics. Thecomplete set of genes is called the genome (pronounced JEE-nome).   The project is being coordinated by the National Center forHuman Genome Research, part of the National Institutes of Health inBethesda, Md.   The center's director, James Watson, one of the discoverers ofthe double helix of DNA, predicts the project can be completed in10 to 15 years.   That will vastly simplify the process of understanding thefunction of individual genes and linking certain genes to disease.   Finding disease genes does not immediately lead to a cure forthe disease. Researchers must discover how to correct the defectivegenes _ which can be a difficult task. But finding the diseasegenes is a necessary first step in the process of curing disease.   So-called gene therapy, in which defective genes can be replacedwith normal genes, was a goal of genetics during much of the pastdecade, but it has remained elusive.   Many scientists believe, however, that the first steps towardgene therapy will be taken during the next decade, and someexperiments are likely to be at least partly successful.   The leading method will use viruses engineered in the laboratoryto insert corrective genes into cells as they infect them. Thefirst trials of the feasibility of this method have just begun atthe National Institutes of Health.   Some of the difficult questions biologists will have to answerin the 1990s will be asked outside the laboratory, Leder said.   Recent events suggest that continuing social concerns overanimal rights could impede biological research, he said.   In April, for example, demonstrators pounded on windows andbroke open a door at the National Institutes of Health, and 37 werearrested. ``We're protesting the murders of millions of animals,''they said.   In June, the city council in Cambridge, Mass., home to Harvardand MIT, adopted animal rights legislation that will allow acommissioner to make unannounced lab visits and fine researchers$300 a day for violations.   ``There are those who feel the life of a rat is as important asthe life of a child,'' said Leder. ``We have to be prepared to makepeople understand that genetics is another very powerful tool inthe armamentarium we have against disease.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wednes PMs, Nov. 1, and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
