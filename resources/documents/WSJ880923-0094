She rents movies from time to time and received a gift of three Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers videos from her brother in 1986. But even Mr. Astaire, her matinee idol, hasn't performed his fancy footwork on her VCR in more than a year.    &quot;I just don't have the desire to see movies over and over again, and the ones I do love show up often enough on the late show on TV,&quot; says Ms. Langer, who runs a consumer-research company.    Ms. Langer's video habits might change by the end of the year, depending on how susceptible she is to ads and promotions. She's exactly the kind of customer for which video marketers will be spending millions of dollars this fall trying to convert from an occasional movie renter to an ardent movie collector.    &quot;It's just a matter of time before people develop the habit of buying videos,&quot; says Al Reuben, senior vice president at Vestron Video, a distributor. &quot;Americans love to collect things, and a video collection will make a statement about your personality just as a book library does.&quot;    Paul Kagan Associates Inc. is bullish about video sales, too. The media research firm predicts consumer purchases of videocassettes will spurt to 223 million in 1993 from an estimated 87 million this year. &quot;Discount pricing will drive consumer sales,&quot; says Tom Adams, a Paul Kagan analyst. &quot;The magic price point seems to be $20, and more and more tapes are being sold at that level or lower.&quot;    Video distributors hope to snare buyers this Christmas season with a bigger arsenal of marketing gimmicks than ever before, from $5 rebates to buy-two-get-one-free specials. They also are increasing their penetration of mass-merchandise stores such as K mart and bookstore chains. And they are investing record amounts in advertising and promotions.    The fall's costliest battle pits E.T. against Cinderella. People in the video industry say the movies will be backed by marketing budgets of at least $25 million each. Marketers bet &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; will be the bigger winner with sales of 10 million to 12 million videocassettes -- making it the all-time best seller. The &quot;Cinderella&quot; marketing story will probably have a happy ending, too: Sales are expected to range between four million and five million videos.    The big challenge is to coax consumers to make that first video purchase. Marketers say research indicates that after people finally buy their first video, they typically follow up with six more purchases over the next 12 months.    Some marketers are trying to inspire a collecting mentality by packaging series of videos, such as the Marilyn Monroe Collection. When consumers buy &quot;The Seven-Year Itch,&quot; for instance, CBS/Fox Video tries to whet their appetites by including clips from other Monroe films.    But it's still debatable whether people will ever collect videos to the extent they do books and records. &quot;Some people believe 'E.T.' may be the breakthrough title that will motivate large numbers of consumers to start buying videos, but I don't think a single title can do the job,&quot; says Jerilyn Kessel, managing director of Video Flash, a marketing research service. &quot;It will be a long, slow process.&quot;    Mr. Adams, the media analyst, adds that some people don't like collecting videos because they're big and bulky. &quot;Books take up a lot of room, too,&quot; he notes, &quot;but they have an aura of refinement that videos will never have.&quot;    Marketers are counting heavily on video tie-ins with packaged-goods companies to stir demand this holiday season. People who purchase PepsiCo soft drinks can get a $5 rebate on &quot;E.T.&quot;; Crest toothpaste buyers will qualify for a $3 refund on &quot;Cinderella.&quot; Royal Crown Cola Co. is offering the Christmas classic &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; on video free to customers, while Ralston Purina Co. is plugging its new cereal Bran News with a half-price offer on the &quot;Best of Abbott and Costello&quot; video. And McDonald's Corp. will help promote a new series of Muppet videos as well as Mickey Mouse videos commemorating the rodent's 60th birthday.    The rebates, of course, make videos affordable to more people; Walt Disney Co. found that the $3 Crest refund increased by 25% the number of people who said they definitely would buy &quot;Cinderella.&quot; But equally important is the extra exposure the videos get in the packaged goods' TV ads and supermarket displays.    What's in it for the packaged-goods companies? An RC Cola commercial leads off the free copies of &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; which the company hopes will get many repeat viewings. Soft-drink and candy companies also can use the promotions to get their brands stocked in video stores. &quot;People think munchies when they watch movies,&quot; says Mr. Reuben of Vestron, which is working with Nestle on a $10 million video and candy promotion.    Packaged-goods companies expect less tangible rewards from some videos. Michael Lorelli, Pepsi executive vice president for marketing, won't just be counting the responses to the &quot;E.T.&quot; rebate. &quot;Most of all,&quot; he says, &quot;we'll get the warm association with E.T., which is very important to Pepsi's image.&quot;    Some video companies also are turning to the packaged-goods industry for marketers well versed in stimulating consumer purchases. Take Carole Black, vice president for world-wide marketing at Disney's home-video division. She handled such brands as Gleem toothpaste and Head andamp; Shoulders shampoo while at Procter andamp; Gamble early in her career, and she was management supervisor on the Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. account at the DDB Needham ad agency. Similarly, Bruce Pfander, marketing director at CBS/Fox, previously promoted Minute Rice for General Foods Corp. and Hi-C for Coca-Cola Co.    &quot;Most people in the video business came from the movie or record industry, but we need even more people from food and household-product companies, who really know how to pull consumers in the store to buy,&quot; says Ron Castell, a marketing executive for Erol's Inc., a video-store chain based in Springfield, Va.    Video companies believe rental stores also could be more aggressive in marketing home videos. &quot;We're frustrated every day by video stores that refuse to help us develop the sell-through market,&quot; says Eric Doctrow, senior vice president at Paramount Home Video, a unit of Gulf andamp; Western's Paramount Pictures Corp. &quot;They're comfortable with renting tapes, which is a no-brainer. But selling video requires different skills and a bigger commitment of money&quot; for inventory and marketing.    Video stores, however, say they are reluctant to risk losing rental business, which often is more lucrative than sales. &quot;Marketing will generate more consumer sales, but the profit margins are often smaller than on rentals,&quot; says Tom Gruber, chief marketing officer at Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., a video-store chain based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.    Nevertheless, he and other video-store operators do plan some new tactics to encourage purchases. They don't want to lose too many sales to mass merchants such as K mart, which has set up video departments in its stores and is using bargain-priced video hits to lure customers. Blockbuster, for instance, will soon create specially designated sales departments in its video-rental stores; customers now can enter some of the stores and not even realize videos are sold there.    Next month, Erol's will make an even bigger commitment: It will open a store in a Washington, D.C., suburb that will only sell videos. &quot;To move a lot of videos, we have to offer customers a wide selection of titles, not just the latest hits,&quot; says Mr. Castell. &quot;We also need to talk up the joys of owning a movie more. If a customer rents the same movie more than once, you should suggest they buy it. That's good salesmanship.&quot;    ---                     What People Buy          Breakdown of unit sales of home videos                  to consumers in 1987 -          Movies ............................ 51%          Adult (sexually explicit and            all other types of video......... 13%          Children's movies ................. 11%          Other children's programs ......... 11%          Exercise ..........................  4%          Sports ............................  4%          Music .............................  3%          Instructional (excluding sports) ..  3%    Source: CBS/Fox Video.
