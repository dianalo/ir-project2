The report, based on the bank's survey of 1,391 companiesconducted in July, represents a 5.1 percentage-point jump incapital-spending plans from the previous survey conducted inJanuary.   &quot;The January survey covers the fiscal year beginning inApril, when a lot of corporate-spending plans still haven'tbeen settled, so estimates are usually lower than the Julysurvey. But even so, the latest results show a healthy rise,&quot;said a bank official.   The expected 16.1% rise would constitute the thirdstraight year of double-digit growth, following increases of10.9% and 15.6% in the previous two fiscal years, theofficial said.   The report said the manufacturing sector's plans areespecially bullish, with outlays expected to be 21.8% higherthis year. Following increases of 25.4% and 24.6% in the pasttwo fiscal years, respectively, the report said the latestrise would result in the first three-year stretch of morethan 20% growth since the bank began its surveys in 1975.                                                                                                          MORE TV FOR PORTUGAL                                                                                                          President Mario Soares ended Portugal's 26-year governmenttelevision monopoly by signing a law allowing two privatestations to run alongside the two existing state-runchannels. Competition for commercial-television rights isexpected to be intense. The legislation stipulates that atleast 10% of the programs on the new channels must be made inPortugal and 50% must be in Portuguese. In addition,advertising can't occupy more than 15% of air time, andpornographic programs are banned.                                                                                                          DOWRY DEATHS                                                                                                          An average of more than 10 women a day died in India lastyear because they didn't bring an adequate dowry to theirmarriages, Home Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed toldParliament. Dowry-related deaths totaled 4,006 in 1989,nearly double the year-earlier toll. The official didn't sayhow the brides had died, but there are frequent reports ofwomen being doused in kerosene and burned alive in whatfamilies call kitchen accidents.                                                                                                          WOES FOR LEBANON                                                                                                          Lebanese bank and municipal employees started a strike forhigher wages. The action by employees at 118 private banksand the central bank quickly caused a shortage of cashthroughout Lebanon. The strike by the municipal employees wasexpected to cause health problems in Beirut and other cities.The General Confederation of Labor Unions, which representsan estimated 200,000 members, called for a demonstration inMoslem West Beirut yesterday afternoon to protest soaringprices and deteriorating living conditions.                                                                                                          TROPIC TOPIC                                                                                                          Disappearing mangroves have joined vanishing rain forestsas a cause for concern. Delegates from 20 Asia-Pacificnations yesterday established the International Society forMangrove Ecosystems, to be based at Ryukyu University onOkinawa. Many of the trees, which grow around estuaries intropical and subtropical regions, have been felled recentlyto make way for factories and shrimp farms. Some experts saidOkinawa, for example, has lost 90% of its mangroves.                                                                                                          WIDENING GAP                                                                                                          The Philippines had a first-half trade deficit of $1.87billion, widened from a $1.15 billion deficit a year earlier,the Central Bank of the Philippines said. The latest period'sleading exports included semiconductor devices, coconut oil,children's and infant's clothing, copper, and electrical andelectronic machinery and parts. Crude oil, electroniccomponents, fabrics and aircraft led imports.                                                                                                          FEUDING FARMERS                                                                                                          Feuds over scarce resources in China's vast interior havemade peasant farmers extra keen on having sons -- not so muchto work the fields as to fight other farmers.   The official Farmer's Daily said the trend was the latestin a litany of woes, including corruption and resentment,plaguing China's birth-control policy in the countryside.   &quot;There are some peasants who scheme about raising thebalance of power against hostile other farmers by having moresons,&quot; the newspaper commented. &quot;They think that more menmean more power.&quot;   It cited an example of one farmer whose son was carted offto a labor camp for 12 years for beating up neighbors. &quot;Onehas gone,&quot; the farmer was quoted as saying. &quot;I'll just rearanother.&quot;   The newspaper said such &quot;faulty mentalities&quot; stemmed fromincreasing conflicts caused by the scarcity of oil,fertilizer, electricity, medicine, plastic sheeting and otherbasic items.
