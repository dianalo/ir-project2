As the 21st centuryapproaches, the federal government must adapt its role in oursociety to meet changing demands arising from changing needs andrequirements. At the turn of the century, the U.S. population willexceed 268 million, with a greater proportion of elderly requiringmore specialized services. The nation will operate at a much fasterpace as changes in technology and communication link the world'seconomies, trade, capital flows and travel as never before.   I have asked the Office of Domestic Affairs and the Office ofManagement and Budget to work with the President's Council onManagement Improvement to conduct an in-depth review and recommendto me by this August what further adjustments in the federal roleshould be made to prepare for the challenge of government in the21st century. This summer I will receive their report, ``Governmentof the Future.'' I also intend to complete the ``Reform '88''management improvement program I started six years ago to ovwerhaulthe administrative, financial and credit systems in our federalgovernment; to implement productivity and quality plans in eachagency; and to examine the needs of the federal work force of thefuture. I want to leave a legacy of good management of today'sprograms, with plans in place to handle tomorrow's challenges.   Efforts to improve the management of the federal government mustbe continued. We have all heard stories of the horrible waste thatoccurs in the federal government. Some of it is obvious _ like thebillions of dollars in unneeded projects that were included in thethousand-page 1988 spending bill that was dropped on my desk lastDecember. Some are not obvious _ like the billion dollars inunnecessary interest expense the government paid, year after year,because it lacked a cash management system, or the billions ofdollars lost annually for lack of a credit management process toensure collection of the trillion dollars in loans owed the federalgovernment.   In July 1980, I promised the American people: ``I will notaccept the excuse that the federal government has grown ... beyondthe control of any president, administration or Congress ... we aregoing to put an end to the notion that the American taxpayer existsto fund the federal government. The federal government exists toserve the American people ... I pledge my administration will dothat.'' I have delivered on that promise.   The first step was taken within months after my inaugurationwhen I formed the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency,composed of the agency inspectors general. By the time I leaveoffice, they will have delivered savings of over $110 billion inreduced waste, fraud and abuse to the American people.   Then, in March 1982, I initiated the world's largest managementimprovement program with these words: ``With Reform '88 we're goingto streamline and reorganize the processes that control the money,information, personnel and property of the federal bureaucracy.'' Itold my cabinet at that time that ``we have six years to changewhat it took twenty or thirty to create _ and we came to Washingtonto make changes!'' I have followed up on that commitment. ThePresident's Council on Management Improvement has overseen thiseffort, and is generating significant results.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
