The codeincludes steady-state estimates of what are often considered safety margins.These estimates may include power peaking factors, hot channel factorcomponents, and laminar flow entrance effects. A listing of the codeand a description of the input are included, along with some sample results.The current version of the code has only properties data for light water.4 refs., 3 figs., 11 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
