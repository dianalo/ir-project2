He mutters that the four Palestinians threw away the leaflets, which called for a general strike, when they realized they were about to be caught. As her rapid-fire questions continue, his answers become increasingly abrupt.    The judge, an Israeli army officer, shares the witness's irritation. &quot;We've got work to do,&quot; he snaps. &quot;We're not here to waste time.&quot;    When Ms. Tsemel stands up in court on behalf of her clients, it often seems as though she is the one on trial. An Israeli Jew, she has become notorious for embracing a clientele that others shun: terrorists, Palestine Liberation Organization members and, since December, scores of participants in the uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    As violence in the territories continues, the Israeli military courts have come under increasing pressure -- and scrutiny. In Gaza, Palestinian lawyers are on strike to protest the &quot;sham justice&quot; they say the courts are handing out to the hundreds who have been arrested there.    Ms. Tsemel is honoring the strike in Gaza, but she continues to practice on the West Bank, one of only a handful of Jewish lawyers who will defend Palestinians charged with security offenses. In such cases, which can range from distributing a PLO leaflet to blowing up a building, victories are few. In 15 years, Ms. Tsemel says, &quot;I can count my wins on one hand -- with two fingers missing.&quot;    Her work doesn't win her many friends, either. &quot;What she does is treason in my opinion,&quot; says Azriel Barak, whose son and daughter-in-law were murdered by a terrorist Ms. Tsemel helped defend. The state of Israel considers her a security risk. She has been banned from representing clients in some particularly sensitive trials.    Sometimes, feelings against the 42-year-old lawyer run so high that court proceedings are disrupted. In 1979, when she appeared for two Palestinians accused in a massacre of 34 passengers on an Israeli bus, the case was interrupted day after day by anguished relatives shouting &quot;whore&quot; and other epithets at Ms. Tsemel. &quot;You sold out your country, you bitch, for PLO money,&quot; yelled a woman heckler.    But insults don't stop Ms. Tsemel. She is a Trotskyist, and she believes that Israel has moved away from its egalitarian principles in its treatment of Palestinians. &quot;What I'm doing is in Israel's interest,&quot; she says, &quot;even if Israelis don't realize it.&quot;    Nowadays, with the Palestinian uprising entering its fourth month, the waiting room of Ms. Tsemel's office in the Arab quarter of East Jerusalem is crowded. A woman in a traditional embroidered dress has come about her children: Her son is in a hospital after a beating by soldiers, and her daughter is undergoing interrogation in a Jerusalem jail. A young teacher explains why he has come to Ms. Tsemel rather than a Palestinian lawyer: &quot;As a Jew, she knows her way around these crazy laws,&quot; he says.    Ms. Tsemel talks to her clients in Arabic and jots notes on their cases in Hebrew. At lunch time, an Arab neighbor sends over a steaming dish of chicken and rice. She shares the bowl with her three assistants, Arab style, and then heads for court on the West Bank.    Before setting out, she drapes a black and white Arab scarf across the dashboard of her car. The scarf, or &quot;keffiyeh,&quot; has become a symbol of support for the Palestinian uprising, and Ms. Tsemel hopes that it will help save her car's paint work from the stones that often greet Israeli vehicles traveling on the West Bank.    But as she returns home to her Jewish neighborhood in central Jerusalem, she has to remember to stuff the keffiyeh back into the glove compartment. &quot;I try not to outrage the neighbors,&quot; she says. &quot;It's a schizophrenic life I lead.&quot;    That feeling is likely to become even more pronounced when her teen-age son begins compulsory army service in two years' time. He may well find himself confronting his mother's clients. But Ms. Tsemel says that she has never considered escaping such problems by migrating. &quot;I really do believe the individual has the power to make a difference,&quot; she says.    In the Ramallah courtroom, where Ms. Tsemel is appearing for a string of clients, the spectators' benches are packed with relatives of Palestinian prisoners. &quot;She is the only person in this room speaking the truth,&quot; whispers Hani Loucata, whose nephew, Nidal, is awaiting trial for throwing stones.    Ringed with high walls and tangles of barbed wire, the Ramallah court is attached to a detention center crowded with participants in the strikes and riots of the uprising. Adjacent to the courtroom, dozens of prisoners sit huddled shoulder to shoulder on the floor of a dark, overcrowded holding pen.    When they are finally herded into the dock, defendants look hollow-eyed and exhausted. One old man stands up unsteadily as his name is called: He is pleading guilty to throwing stones in a demonstration. &quot;I'm sure he didn't do it,&quot; Ms. Tsemel says later. &quot;Everybody else in that demonstration was a child.&quot;    In many cases, clients have signed confessions before Ms. Tsemel is even allowed to see them. Lawyers can be denied access until the security services are through interrogating prisoners. But even without a confession, Ms. Tsemel says, the word of the arresting soldier will always carry more weight than the word of the accused. &quot;Testimony must be very bad before the court will even question it,&quot; she says.    Ms. Tsemel speaks in a gravelly baritone. To hammer a point, she can send her voice booming through the court. Mostly, though, her technique rests on a meticulous sifting of every shred of testimony, searching for inconsistencies that may buy her client a better verdict. In the case of the four alleged pamphleteers, the prosecution is asking for a one-year prison term. While Ms. Tsemel doesn't expect an acquittal, she hopes she can cast enough doubt on the soldier's evidence to get the judge to hand down a lighter sentence. &quot;You don't win in this business,&quot; she explains. &quot;You just lose a little less badly.&quot;    Most Israelis believe that the country's painful history as a terrorist target justifies tough measures against opponents. They point out that Israel's military-justice system and its civil-rights record compare favorably with those of any of its Arab neighbors. &quot;We're dealing here with a violent environment where human life is worth nothing,&quot; says Elyakim Ha'etzni, an attorney. &quot;We can play democracy until we die of &quot;democratitis acuta&quot; and our post mortem will be very democratic, but very dead.&quot;    Like many Israelis, he regards Ms. Tsemel's work as subversive. &quot;What British attorney would defend a Nazi in the second world war?&quot; he asks. &quot;In Israel, we are at war, and if you defend terrorists you cross the line into the enemy camp.&quot;    Ms. Tsemel crossed that line just after the 1967 war. Until then, she says, she was &quot;apolitical and very naive.&quot;    She describes her parents as &quot;normal Israelis&quot; who migrated in the 1930s from Russia and Poland. Ms. Tsemel served in the army and was studying law when the Six-Day War swept huge slabs of Arab territory under Israeli control. &quot;I believed it was a war for peace, that Israel would use its victory to make peace with its neighbors,&quot; Ms. Tsemel says. &quot;I quickly learned that there was no intention of giving up the {West Bank and Gaza} and no interest in making peace.&quot; The war, she says, changed her views in the same way that Vietnam radicalized many Americans.    To Ms. Tsemel, the recent Israeli crackdown is just a continuation of the policies she abhors. While Israelis must be 14 years old to be considered adults before the law, in the occupied territories the age is 12. (Israelis point out that Jordanian law in the West Bank allowed even younger children to be tried as adults.) A military area-commander can order imprisonment for up to six months, without charge, of anyone suspected of posing a security risk.    Defendants can also be convicted on evidence that neither they nor their lawyers are allowed to see. The government says this is necessary to protect its informants and surveillance techniques. But Ms. Tsemel says that it makes mounting a defense almost impossible. &quot;You have to stand up and deny everything, beginning with the murder of John Kennedy,&quot; she says.    Secret evidence is currently being used to justify the deportation of one of her clients, a West Bank student who is said to have taken part in operations for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Ms. Tsemel is fighting the deportation in the High Court of Justice, a sober setting where Ms. Tsemel has to wear traditional black robes to address the five judges.    On the evidence openly available, she says, her client's deportation can't be justified. She recites a litany of questions that the committee ordering the deportation couldn't answer, from the exact slogans the defendant is said to have used to incite other students to how many meetings he allegedly attended at coffee houses.    &quot;On what are we going to base our defense if we don't have any information?&quot; she asks. But she doesn't really expect an answer. The High Court has yet to overturn a single deportation order. </TEXT></DOC>
