AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. troops smashed the regime ofGen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Wednesday and installed a newgovernment, but the military ruler who antagonized a superpowerfled into hiding and his loyalists seized some Americans.   More than 20,000 troops backed by warplanes began their invasionshortly after midnight Tuesday under a full moon, poundingPanamanian military installations in and around the capital withmortar, cannon and machine-gun fire.   In the early afternoon, smoke rose from the shatteredheadquarters of Noriega's Defense Forces and sporadic gunfire washeard in the distance. Widespread looting broke out.   In the San Miguelito neighborhood to the northeast, attack jetsbombed and helicopters strafed a Defense Forces barracks atop ahill.   More than 50 bodies were counted by one hospital early in thefighting but more bodies flooded in after daybreak. Officials inWashington said nine American servicemen were among the dead.Hundreds of people were wounded.   President Bush said he ordered the invasion after Noriega saidPanama was in a state of war with the United States and after theshooting death last week of a U.S. Marine lieutenant.   He said the attack was a mission to capture Noriega and bringhim trial in the United States for allegedly trafficking inColombian cocaine.   ``Gen. Noriega's reckless threats and attacks upon Americans inPanama created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizensin Panama,'' Bush said in speech to the nation.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the action wasordered after the administration received unconfirmed reports thatNoriega intended to attack a U.S. residential neighborhood inPanama.   Pamana's national radio reported about 40 Americans had been``detained,'' while Cable News Network said at least 10 Americanswere held hostage. Troops loyal to Noriega were seen taking atleast two Americans away from Panama City's Marriott Hotel.   Opposition leader Guillermo Endara, winner of the May 7elections that were voided by the Noriega-controlled government,was sworn in as president and given immediate U.S. backing.   Bush later ordered that economic and political sanctions belifted and authorized federal drug agents to pursue arrests inPanama.   But provisional President Francisco Rodriguez and ForeignMinsiter Leonardo Kam, both installed by Noriega, held a newsconference at the Foreign Ministry office in the capital anddeclared they still governed.   ``The government controls the situation in the country and itsinstitutions,'' Rodriguez said. ``We are prepared to resist.''   It was clear, however, that U.S. troops controlled the capital.   The huge assault by Marines, infantrymen, sailors, airmen andparatroopers was the bloody pinnacle of Washington's long war withNoriega, a bellicose career soldier who had a strong core ofsupport among working class people and who seemed to delight indefying the mighty United States.   Noriega survived two coup attempts from within the PanamanianDefense Forces that he headed, including one October insurrectionin which he was briefly captured. He survived Washington's bestnon-military efforts to oust him, including harsh economicsanctions that severely depressed the economy.   There was strong evidence in the two previous coup attempts ofdissatisfaction within the military with Noriega, and it wasunclear how much of his support was holding after the U.S. attack.   In his address, Bush said he intends to turn over the PanamaCanal as required under existing treaties.   Noriega has denied the drug charges and claims the United Stateswanted him out so it could renege on 1977 treaties that cedecontrol of the Panama Canal by the year 2000.   At the Fort Clayton U.S. base outside the capital, U.S. charged'affaires John Bushnell said Noriega ``may take to the hills andbe very hard to find ... but he wouldn't have a significant forceto actually do anything.''   ``We will chase him, and we will find him,'' Gen. Colin Powell,chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in Washington.   Powell said that nine American servicemen were killed, 39 werewounded and one was missing.   Rodriguez said more than 60 Panamanians died in the fighting,and several hundred were wounded, mostly civilians. He said U.S.troops in the Chorillo area, where the fighting was heaviest, didnot allow the Red Cross to enter the area.   A man indentified only as Major Caballero said on National Radiothat ``40 Americans have been detained,'' but that figure could notbe confirmed.   Two paramilitary Panamanian troops arrived at the capital'sMarriott Hotel at about 9 a.m. and took away three Americans. Thesoldiers then asked the front desk for a list of guests and wherethey were staying. The desk said it did not give it to them.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said U.S. forces in Panama wereaware of hostages taken from the Marriott. ``We will make effortsto take care of that,'' said Williams, declining to elaborate.   Williams said he did not know how many Americans were being held.   Earlier in the invasion, Panamanian troops held 12 foreigners atthe Marriott, including eight Americans, for about two hours.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
