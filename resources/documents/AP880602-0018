Mike Synar, D-Okla.,chairman of the Government Operations subcommittee on environment,energy and natural resources.   DeVito said his Princeton, N.J., company has refused to insure30 of the 105 government-accredited contractors seeking coverage.   The accreditation program was set up by Congress in 1986 inresponse to widespread reports that untrained people were doingremoval work, frequently making a bad situation worse by improperprocedures that filled the air with asbestos fibers that cause lungcancer.   The 240 instruction centers around the nation are turning outsome 2,000 inspectors and contractors monthly who are certified bythe Environmental Protection Agency.   The 1986 law requires that school districts hire only certifiedfirms and at least begin asbestos removal work by July 1989. EPAestimates that some 30,000 schools could need asbestos work.   Synar said the testimony could strengthen efforts of a sizablenumber of lawmakers and local school boards to amend the law todelay the mandatory asbestos removal beyond July 1989.   Bill Kitchen of the Johnstown, N.Y., school board told thesubcommittee's hearing Wednesday that when he took an EPA-approvedcourse, he encountered lackadaisical attitudes and instructors whoquestioned the proven dangers of asbestos fibers.   DeVito said the background of many course instructors ``isflimsy at best.''   He said there is no requirement that a contractor have anyexperience, meaning anyone can get into the removal business afterfive days of training.   Even if the training is good, DeVito said, there is no guaranteethat contractors will not try to boost profits by cutting cornersbecause they know EPA and the states cannot inspect all removalwork.   ``The programs are not tough enough,'' DeVito said. ``As aresult of the weaknesses with EPA's accreditation of contractors,FEIC is essentially accrediting every contractor and approving eachjob the company insures.''   Kitchen said students at the course he took joked about healthconcerns and made comments like ``we're going to be laughing allthe way to the bank.''   ``The courses themselves do not approach the subject matter in aserious way,'' he maintained.   Kitchen said one principal lecturer questioned health concernsabout asbestos and that students were given an EPA publication that``espouses the (asbestos) industry viewpoint that there is a safelevel of exposure'' to a substance that health experts say has nosafe level.   Asked by Synar to comment on DeVito's letter, Assistant EPAAdministrator John Moore described it as ``disquieting.''   Susan Vogt, deputy director of the EPA's office of toxicsubstances, said that while the agency audits an accreditationcourse once, ``it is an unfortunate fact'' that EPA lacks themanpower to do continued monitoring.</TEXT></DOC>
