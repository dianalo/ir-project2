In order to steer and focusthis electron beam and to measure its emittance and energy spread, asystem of wire scanner beam profile monitors has been developed. Threewire scanners are mounted in a straight line with approximately one meterspacing for emittance measurements. The fourth wire scanner is positionedafter a 45{sup 0} bending magnet for energy spread measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
