Govaerts (Govaerts),individually and doing business as Printlas Europa (Printlas Europa); GorisChristiaan Grandia (Grandia), individually and doing business as GrandiaProject Services; Marcel Sanders (Sanders), individually and doing businessas Belgium Trading Company Lokeren S.A. (Belgium Trading), and Roger VanAlphen (Van Alphen) (collectively referred to as respondents).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Effective October 1, 1988, the Regulations were redesignatedas 15 CFR 768-799 (53 FR 37751, September 28, 1988). The transfer merelychanged the first number of each Part from a ``3'' to a ``7''. Until suchtime as the Code of Federal Regulations is republished, the Regulationscan be found at 15 CFR Parts 368-399 (1988).As a result of an investigation conducted by the Department and the U.S.Customs Service (Customs), the Department has reason to believe that froma date unknown to on or about December 9, 1988, Govaerts, Grandia, Sandersand Van Alphen, while doing business under the names of their respectivecompanies, sought to obtain U.S.-origin equipment, controlled for reasonsof national security, and to export that equipment from the United Statesto Bulgaria, knowing that the Department would not likely authorize theexport of the equipment to Bulgaria.The investigation has revealed that, on or about December 9, 1988, Govaerts,with the aid of Grandia, Sanders and Van Alphen, in fact attempted to exportthe equipment from the United States through the Netherlands to Bulgaria,by falsely declaring that the country of ultimate destination was the Netherlandsand that the equipment could be exported under general license G-DEST.Each of those individuals has been indicted for his respective role inthis matter.The investigation also has given the Department reason to believe thatGovaerts, Grandia, Sanders and Van Alphen have access to large sums ofmoney and that, given the opportunity, they would use that money in thenear future to acquire U.S.-origin equipment similar to that which Govaertsattempted to export in December 1988, and export that equipment to Bulgaria.Moreover, the Department has reason to believe that, if necessary, Govaerts,Grandia, Sanders and Van Alphen would use Belgian contacts to effect theexport of that equipment to Bulgaria.The Department believes that, viewed as a whole, the past activities ofGovaerts, individually and doing business as Printlas Europa; Grandia,individually and doing business as Grandia Project Services; Sanders, individuallyand doing business as Belgium Trading, and Van Alphen demonstrate thatthey are involved in a scheme to obtain controlled U.S.-origin commodities,and to export that equipment from the United States to Bulgaria.Therefore, based on the showing made by the Department, I find that anorder temporarily denying export privileges to Franciscus B. Govaerts,individually and doing business as Printlas Europa; Goris Christiaan Grandia,individually and doing business as Grandia Project Services; Marcel Sanders,individually and doing business as Belgium Trading Company Lokeren S.A.,and Roger Van Alphen is necessary in the public interest to prevent animminent violation of the Act and the Regulations and to give notice tocompanies in the United States and abroad to cease dealing with respondentsin goods and technical data subject to the Act and the Regulations in orderto reduce the substantial likelihood that respondents will continue toengage in activities which are in violation of the Act and the Regulations.This order is issued on an <T3>ex parte</T3> basis without a hearing based on the Department's showingthat expedited action is required.Accordingly, it is hereby <T3>Ordered</T3>I.
