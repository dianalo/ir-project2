They just cut the wires. All they left was this.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A year ago today, this well-to-do town near Bethlehem wasthe center of attention in the Mideast. Beit Sahur wasbesieged by Israeli troops because of the unusual manner ofits participation in the &quot;intifada,&quot; the Palestinian uprisingin the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that now has beengoing on for almost three years. Many of Beit Sahur's 12,000people defied the Israeli occupation -- not by throwingstones, but by refusing to pay their taxes. Their resistanceprovoked an army curfew, and ultimately a siege, during whichthe army cut all road and telephone links. Only people whopaid their taxes could enter or leave.   For 42 days, the townspeople didn't budge. On the 43rdday, Israeli tax collectors assisted by soldiers moved in toseize property -- from Mr. Massad's dental equipment to cars,televisions, even socks. About $1.5 million in property wasseized and auctioned off; 40 people were arrested and manywere jailed.   To the outside world, Beit Sahur illustrated that massopposition to the Israeli role in the West Bank spans alleconomic classes of Palestinians, including professionals whohave succeeded economically under Israeli rule. And perhapsbecause of its sharp contrast with the bus attacks, rockthrowing and other violence of the intifada, Beit Sahur'snonviolent resistance showed that not everyone who opposedthe occupation was a terrorist.   A year later, life here is harder. City counsellor AtallahRishmawi says the city's economy is half what it was. Nearlya quarter of the small textile workshops that dotted the townhave closed. Outside the al Sha'ab pharmacy near the smallcity hall, groups of unemployed young men gossip and loiterfor hours.   Nonetheless, people here say resistance to Israeli rule ishardening. Though Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has pushed theuprising to the back pages, people in Beit Sahur say they aredetermined to continue their tax boycott.   &quot;They destroyed my business. They took my television. Theyput me in prison. But still I continue to fight,&quot; says Mr.Massad. &quot;This is war. People are just as determined to resistas ever, and to assist in the intifada. Nothing has beenresolved.&quot;   Beit Sahur has been energized by Saddam Hussein's takeoverof Kuwait. People say they support Mr. Hussein because he isthe only Arab strong enough to defy their principal foreignenemy, the U.S. At a building-supplies shop, which stocksonly half as much as it once did, a plumber named Tewfik putsit simply: &quot;Saddam is good, the Americans no. You are eitherwith us Arabs, or you are against us.&quot;   Beit Sahur is a potent reminder that the situation thatled to the intifada hasn't been resolved. Though Israeliofficials quietly press the point that they accurately warnedthe world long ago about Saddam Hussein's territorialambitions, the Israelis have a lingering problem in their ownbackyard, on territory taken in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.And while observers say the intifada is in a quiet phase,violence on either side could make it erupt again.   &quot;The intifada is definitely not over,&quot; says Keith Kyle, aMideast specialist at London's Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs. &quot;It may have quieted somewhat due toless arrogant Israeli policing and more internal Palestinianbickering and fatigue. But I don't think {the Palestinians'}sheer determination has been weakened.&quot;   Beit Sahur, whose sun-parched buildings of pale flintstonerise from ancient Judean hills, seems an unlikely place for arevolt. Biblical scholars say this is the tranquil spot whereshepherds were awakened by an angel to Jesus's birth inBethlehem. The once-prosperous merchants wear Baume andamp; Mercierwatches and drive Fords, like city counsellor Rishmawi, aleader of the tax revolt.   But while their feet are firmly on the ground, theirhearts and minds are elsewhere. &quot;We want to be free. Whyshould we pay for our own occupation?&quot; asks Mr. Rishmawi.Before the siege, he says, &quot;We were called the Japan ofPalestine. We calculate we lost a total of $5 million in thesiege, both in lost material and lost business.&quot; He leafsthrough Arabic ledgers documenting the seized property. &quot;Wehave less to lose now,&quot; he says.   People credit the international outcry over Beit Sahur asone of the factors in lightening the Israelis' hand in theterritories. While the current Israeli government isconsidered among the most hawkish in more than 40 years,Defense Minister Moshe Arens's policy of &quot;avoidingunnecessary friction&quot; has led to an easing of tension and asharp drop in the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis.   Indeed, while nearly 1,000 people have been killed in the33 months since the uprising began, the balance has shifted:The number of Palestinians killed by other Palestinians isrising quickly, and the number killed by Israeli troops isdeclining. Last month, intra-Palestinian fatalities in theoccupied territories totaled 41, more than four times thenumber killed by Israeli troops. &quot;Obviously, the intifadaisn't over, but we think our policy is working,&quot; says anIsraeli official.   Still, the Palestinians are far from united. &quot;We are verytroubled by the high rate of killing&quot; in internal Palestinianclashes, says a Palestinian spokesman in Jerusalem. Despiteclaims that most murdered Palestinians are Israelicollaborators, it isn't clear how strong intifada leaders'control is. And some activists want to switch from stones tobullets.   But in Beit Sahur, regardless of the bickering amongPalestinians, the bad feelings generated by the tax siegeappear to guarantee continued resistance.   Naila Hayek Rishmawi, a secretary, recalls that when thepatrol came to arrest her husband after the siege, hertwo-year-old daughter Nadine burst into tears, crying &quot;PLOyes, Israel no.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
