The agency said it asked District Judge James Redden in Portland, Ore., to stay his order allowing use of dinoseb on green peas, snap beans, cucurbits and caneberries in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. The EPA said dinoseb use could affect the health and safety of thousands of farmers, their families and unborn children.    The EPA issued a temporary order banning dinoseb sales and uses last October because it has been proved to cause birth defects and sterility in laboratory animals and is suspected of causing such conditions in humans. The agency also said the chemical is highly toxic, and that it received new test data last week that indicate dinoseb is harmful at one-third the concentration previously thought hazardous.    Nevertheless, the EPA has allowed the chemical's use on dry peas, lentils and chick peas in parts of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. An agency spokesman, Al Heier, said it granted the exceptions because these crops are grown by few farmers in small areas that can be closely monitored.    Dinoseb is a herbicide that also serves as a fungicide and an insecticide. It has been used on a variety of crops. In recent years, seven to 11 million pounds of the chemical have been sold annually in the U.S. by about 80 companies, including the Uniroyal Chemical Co. unit of Uniroyal Inc., Cedar Chemical Corp. and a U.S. unit of Hoechst AG of West Germany, the EPA said.    According to the EPA, Judge Redden's order broadened the list of crops exempted from the ban until the agency issues a final decision permanently banning the pesticide. He ruled that the agency's earlier order was &quot;arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion&quot; that didn't comply with the proper legal procedures, the agency said. </TEXT></DOC>
