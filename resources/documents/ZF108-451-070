Baldwin, deputy director for command, control andcommunications support in the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, &quot;Engineering forthe integration we need will not be as difficult as defining the requirements-- determining which agencies have to be linked to each other, what databasesneed to be hooked up.&quot;andM;DCA still must find a way to protect the proprietary data in agency systems,Baldwin said.andM;&quot;We can't have a system that makes the names of one agency's confidentialsources of information widely available,&quot; he noted.andM;Baldwin also said organizational structures can be especially diffucult tofactor into systems requirements, which he described as &quot;the needlinesbetween 35 separate entities.&quot;andM;By example, he noted that the National Guard Bureau has supported much of thenational interdiction effort but that ADP integration with the Guard cannotbe done solely in Washington because the Guard works under 50 different statecharters as well.andM;Officials said several key decisions have been made.andP;  Shamla said militarycommanders in the field have formed &quot;drug annexes&quot; that includecommunications and information specialists.andM;Interfaces between those commanders and local and regional law enforcementorganizations were planned originally as regional efforts but will be done&quot;in a more centralized way,&quot; Baldwin said.andP;  He said the Joint chiefs decidedto centralize after the commanders said there were too many complexities forthem to handle.andM;A potential focal point for DOD's role in the drug war, officials said, willbe a national drug intelligence center, an idea they said Justice Departmentofficials are considering.andM;David Westrate, the Drug Enforcement Agency's assistant administrator foroperations, said DEA's El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) is being expandedto accommodate permanent DOD representation.andM;EPIC collects data from intelligence and law enforcement agencies in theUnited State and other countries, Westrate said.andP;  &quot;Some sophisticatedinterfaces&quot; to the Army's Southern Command in Panama are being installed atEPIC, he said.andM;&quot;But we still haven't determined how we attach this center to the [overall]U.S.andP;  military effort,&quot; Westrate said.andP;  Automation is the &quot;biggest area ofbusiness possibility for industry to support the drug war.andP;  There is anenormous amount of data to be processed, but we don't have the hardware toprocess it.&quot;andM;Capt.andP;  Laurie L. Somers, chairman of the Coast Guard's communicationsinteroperability working group, said the Coast Guard has beefed up severalnetworks in recent years but is looking to DOD for more ADP capability.andO;Somers said the use of interactive databases cuts down on duplicateinterdiction efforts within the Coast Guard, but officials said duplicationamong departments is still common.andM;Westrate said DOD will face less political risk by trying to integrateexisting systems than by developing a single drug information system.andM;&quot;I don't think the Congress or the American public wants to have a BigBrother-type computer system,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
