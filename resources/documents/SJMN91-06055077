There is some variation by size and typeof company, but in general, about 37.6 cents of every dollar of compensationyour boss pays out goes for benefits.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Professional Careers  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  COST OF BENEFITS KEEPS CLIMBING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Benefits  </MEMO><TEXT>     Specifically, legally required benefits (such as unemployment taxes) eat upabout 8.7 cents of every dollar; retirement and pension plans about 5.1 cents;medical benefits about 9.3 cents; sick leave, holidays and vacation benefitsabout 10.8 cents; paid rest and lunch breaks about 2.3 cents; and lifeinsurance and miscellaneous another 1.4 cents.;    So, of every dollar ofcompensation your boss pays out, you get about 62.4 cents as direct pay andwithholding, and about 37.6 cents in benefits of one kind or another. Here's amore specific breakdown of the sorts of specific benefits major companies arepaying their salaried employees, based on the Hewitt survey:;    (check)Retirement benefits. More than 84 percent of employers offer employees sometype of retirement benefit plan. Most calculate benefits based on anemployee's highest average pay (usually a five-year average); the typicalmatched savings plan matches employee contributions at a fixed rate (usually50 cents on the dollar, or dollar for dollar) up to a maximum of 6 percent ofpay.;    (check) Medical benefits. Virtually every employer in this surveyprovides medical coverage for its salaried employees. In about half of thesefirms, employees are required to contribute to the cost of their own coverage,while 75 percent require employee contributions toward their family'scoverage, too. Monthly contributions average $10 to $30 for single coverageand $20 to $60 for family coverage. And most plans (74 percent) requireemployees to pay initial medical expenses incurred each year through afront-end deductible.;    (check) Other health-care benefits. Ninety-twopercent of employers offer some type of dental-care plan, while about 20percent offer eye-care benefits.;    (check) Group life and disabilitybenefits. Just about all employers also offer group life and disabilitybenefits.;    (check) Vacations. All companies provide vacation benefits.These are mostly tied to the employee's years of service. For the typicalcompany, employees with one year of service get two weeks paid time off. Thosewith 10 years typically get three to four weeks off, and at 20 years ofservice, most employers provide four weeks' vacation.;    (check) Work andfamily benefits. With more and more single-parent and two-worker householdstoday, work and family benefits are increasingly popular. About two-thirds ofthe employers -- 535 companies -- responding to the survey have some type ofchild-care assistance, although it's often just a referral service. Only 16percent provide assistance through a child-care center. But over half of theemployers offer some type of flexible scheduling, such as flextime or jobsharing, while 46 percent offer parental-leave programs.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GARY DESSLER, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910224  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2PC  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  503  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 24, 199100055077,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
