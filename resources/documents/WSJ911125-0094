Now, a growing number of Wall Street firms are clamoringto fix the problem, by offering services to small investorsthat purport to divine the &quot;right&quot; asset mix for them. Inexchange for baring the intimate details of their personalfinances, individuals get a free, customized&quot;asset-allocation&quot; blueprint.</LP><TEXT>   But while the results may look precise and scientific,there's a lot of room for interpretation. And differentservices can come up with widely different advice for thesame person. Asked to make recommendations for a 39-year-oldsingle parent, for example, four firms came up withstock-market allocations that ranged from 18% to 66.3%.   Still, there's no denying that many people should bepaying a great deal more attention than they are to how theirinvestments are allocated.   A wealth of academic research shows that stocks offer thebest chance for investors to stay ahead of inflation over thelong run. But individuals on average have a meager 18% oftheir financial assets in stocks and stock funds, accordingto estimates from First Boston Corp. and the Federal Reserve.Nearly a quarter of their total financial assets is CDs andother cash investments, which are generally the leastappealing assets long term.   Investor reaction to the asset-allocation servicesindicates that many individuals are eager for all the advicethey can get.   When Dreyfus Corp. unveiled its new &quot;investmentallocation&quot; service last month by running full-page, mail-inquestionnaires in major publications, the giant mutual fundgroup got a stunning response. &quot;I can't tell you howsurprised we were that so many people would fill out anewspaper clipping with personal information like this,&quot; saysthe firm's chief economist, Richard Hoey.   &quot;It shows the degree of concern people have about what todo with their finances,&quot; says Mr. Hoey, who designed theservice. &quot;People are really lost.&quot;   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. expects its &quot;strategic assetallocation&quot; service to handle &quot;more than 100,000&quot;applications in the first 12 months from its start-up lastspring, says Shelley Freeman, director of financial planning.Other firms, including PaineWebber Group Inc. and PrudentialSecurities Inc., are seeing a similar boom in interest fortheir allocation services.   &quot;There's a resurgence of interest in asset-allocationadvice,&quot; says Bruce Ventimiglia, senior vice president atPrudential. &quot;A large portion of the general populace isunder-invested&quot; in stocks, bonds and other risky assets, hesays, and &quot;as interest rates fall, more people are lookingfor alternatives.&quot;   The asset-allocation services are clearly good marketingtools for the firms, whose main business is selling stocks,bonds and other investments to individuals. Besides directinghow much money an individual should devote to broad assetclasses, such as growth, fixed-income and cash, theseservices also are designed to push specific funds andsecurities that may meet those specifications.   The funds also get a rich lode of personal data onindividuals who apply. Although investors don't have to openan account or pay a fee to get the asset-mix advice, they dohave to disclose copious information. They must divulge theirincome, savings, spending, taxes, the value of insurancepolicies, and an itemized list valuing all the investmentsthey ownfrom bank deposits and certificates of deposit, tostocks, bonds, collectibles and real estate.   The firms can keep that information on file to use howeverthey please, for instance, in follow-up calls to pitch newsecurities offerings, insurance products, money-managementservices and other financial products.   &quot;We're making use of {the information} as a `call list'&quot;for the firm's marketing force, to see if people want to acton the advice, says Mr. Hoey of Dreyfus. Later, he adds, &quot;wecan come back at these people&quot; if the firm has suitable newfunds to offer.   Dreyfus and most other firms do protect investors' privacysomewhat, however, by promising to use the data for inhousepurposes only, and not sell it to outside marketing firms.   The questions the firms ask are similar, although Dreyfusmakes a bigger effort to make risk a central issue. Dreyfus'squestionnaire peppers the individual with questions thatspecifically probe individuals' willingness to accept&quot;greater risk of loss of principal&quot; in pursuit of higherreturns.   Dreyfus also makes specific inquiries as to individuals'mortgages and other debt, with the idea that &quot;if they're headover heels in debt, they can't comfortably afford more risk&quot;even if they want to, says Mr. Hoey.   What about results?   The table accompanying this story shows recommendationsprepared for this newspaper by four firms, with the resultssummarized in three major asset categories: cash, fixedincome (bonds) and &quot;growth&quot; (including not only stocks, butalso options, commodities, partnerships and otherinvestments). Each firm used information on the same fourindividual investors.   In reality, the asset-allocation recommendationsindividuals get from Shearson and Dreyfus pretty much stickwith traditional stock, bond and cash investments. Otherfirms are willing to highlight more esoteric areas.Tangibles, such as gold, silver and collectibles, ratespecial treatment in Prudential's and PaineWebber'sallocations. PaineWebber also puts special emphasis onilliquid &quot;private&quot; investments, such as outright ownership ofreal estate and limited partnerships.   International stock and bond funds figure only marginally-- if at all -- in all the firms' recommendations.   While the brokerage firms' allocation services specifyvery precise percentages of wealth that the investor shouldput in each asset class, those firms expect the individual toconsult with a broker to see what's really appropriate.Dreyfus, on the other hand, presents a wide range ofallocations as &quot;correct&quot; for a given asset class, leavingmore room for individuals to interpret the resultsthemselves. &quot;They can operate within that range according towhat they feel fits,&quot; says Mr. Hoey.   On average, the PaineWebber and Dreyfus models show a moreconservative bias than those of other firms by favoring moregenerous allocations to cash investments. Shearson brokers,however, may increase cash allocations beyond thoserecommended by the firm's model, to make sure individualsalways keep three to six months of living expenses as anemergency cash reserve.   Dreyfus's approach appears to be the least influenced by&quot;market timing&quot; bets about the future direction of themarkets. &quot;I've taken the philosophical view that long-terminvestment strategy shouldn't be highly sensitive to howgurus see the world at any time, because I've been a guru andI know they're wrong most of the time,&quot; says Mr. Hoey.   This approach matches Dreyfus's own desire to get peopleto stay put in its funds, and not shift around frequently.&quot;We don't need income from transactions, we just need assetsunder managementthat's much different from a broker,&quot; saysMr. Hoey.   The brokerage firms' services are more apt to shift inline with the pros' changing forecasts about financialmarkets and the economy. &quot;There's an explicit economic betembedded in our model,&quot; says Peter Tedesco, national salesmanager for financial planning products at PaineWebber. &quot;It'smore of a moving target.&quot;   ---                                                                                                          Recommendations from different asset-allocation servicesmay vary, as shown by these suggestions from some majorinvestment firms for four individual investors.
