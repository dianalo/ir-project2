The new line includes three models that are compatible with International Business Machines Corp.'s PC-AT design and one that is compatible with IBM's Micro Channel Architecture data-bus design.    Kenneth A. Olisa, vice president of marketing, said Wang would offer the new machines at competitive prices below those of IBM and Compaq Corp. He also said Wang will unveil a broad product strategy next month focusing on industry-standard computers and networks.    Wang, which had sales of $3.03 billion in the year ended June 30, has been struggling to stem huge losses. It recently named a new president, former General Electric Co. executive Richard W. Miller.    The Lowell, Mass.-based computer maker also announced a program to improve its dealer marketing efforts. </TEXT></DOC>
