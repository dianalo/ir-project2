That way theydon't have to focus so much on a drought here, a flood there.   For example, in the Agriculture Department's recent studies ofthe farm economy, assumptions are made that the terrible heat anddrought that devastated crops last summer will not be repeated on sogrand a scale in 1989.   But much of the 1988 drought area, particularly in the GreatPlains and western Corn Belt, still hasn't recovered fully. That wasevident in last week's USDA report showing a sharply reduced winterwheat crop.   The big picture looks substantially better, however.   What's more, USDA economists assert that, despite the agonies of1988, farmers generally never before had so much money to spend. Netcash income, the difference between intake and outgo, was at arecord high of about $57.7 billion last year.   Analysts say cash income will fall in 1989 but still may be inthe range of $50 billion to $55 billion. A big reason for thedecline, they say, is a surge in expenses resulting from expandedcrop acreage.   While not all farmers had stored grain to sell last year, thehigh prices resulting from drought losses were one of the reasonsfor the record net cash income. But not all farmers lost cropsbecause of heat and drought either.   So how does the U.S. agricultural sector stack up? One barometeris the condition of the major credit institutions serving farmers.   There are four basic groups: the Farm Credit System, a network ofcooperatively owned insitutions overseen by the federal Farm CreditAdministration; commercial banks; life insurance companies, and theFarmers Home Administration, a USDA agency.   According to a report in the June issue of Agricultural Outlookmagazine, all except FmHA have recovered greatly from the bigfinancial crunch of the early 1980s.   Last year, the report said, loan delinquencies reported by theFarm Credit System, or FCS, dropped $2 billion to half the level oftwo years ago. Life insurance companies showed a drop of $500million in farm real estate loan delinquencies. Commercial banks sawboth delinquency rates and net loan charge-offs on non-real estatefarm loans decline to levels of the early 1980s.   ``If farm loan quality continues to improve at last year's pace,by 1990 farm loans will be near the quality seen before the farmfinancial stress began in the early 1980s,'' the report said.   The improved financial health of farmers and their lenders isalso evident in reduced loan restructuring. In the FCS, for example,loan restructuring declined by half last year.   Farmers' use of Chapter 12 bankruptcy also fell sharply in 1988to 2,035 filings from 6,604 in 1987. The law helps farmersrestructure debt and continue farming.   The combined farm loan volume reported by the four categories for1988 was down only $1.4 billion, ``in sharp contrast to the previousthree years,'' when the volume dropped sharply, the report said.   ``Commercial bank farm loan volume continued to rise in 1988,with $45 billion outstanding at yearend, nearly 4 percent more thana year earlier,'' the report said. ``Banks are continuing to gainmarket share and now hold the greatest proportion of farm debt.''   The net income of the FCS rose to $704 million last year,compared with a net loss of $17 million in 1987, although reductionsin loan-loss reserves and grains from the sale of acquired propertyexplain much of the rise.   But the FCS is ``still having problems generating income,'' thereport said. And the system will continue to consolidate itsoperations. Last year, the 37 banks in the system merged into 15,and the number of FCS associations was trimmed to 281 from 377.   The FmHA has long been considered the government's farm lender oflast resort because it takes on borrowers who have been denied loansby others. In contrast to the other lenders, FmHA continues to be ina ``highly stressed'' situation, with 41 percent of its outstandingloans delinquent as of February, up from 38 percent a year earlier.   ``However, much of the rise is attributable to reduced loanvolume,'' the report said. ``The dollar amount of delinquencieschanged little from last year. FmHA delinquencies are highest duringthe winter because many annual payments come due at yearend. Someborrowers catch up on late payments by summer.''   Farm lenders are ``competing keenly for good-quality'' loans, thereport said. Consequently, this benefits farmers by holding downcredit costs. Even so, because of a general rise in interest rates,farmers faced rising interest rates in 1988 and early 1989.   ``Despite the strong farm financial recovery, lenders areconcerned about the long-term profitability of farm operations andfarmers' ability to repay loans,'' the report said. ``Increasingcompetition for agricultural exports and reduced government (price)support could erode farmers' profitability.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 18</NOTE></DOC>
