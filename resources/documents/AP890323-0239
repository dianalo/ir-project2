The GAF case was the first criminal trial stemming from theinsider trading scandals of the mid-1980s and considered a criticaltest of information supplied by jailed stock speculator Ivan F.Boesky.   After 12 days and more than 90 hours of deliberations, the juryof nine women and three men in federal court in Manhattan said theywere hopelessly deadlocked in a three-way split and U.S. DistrictJudge Mary Johnson Lowe declared the mistrial.   On Jan. 10 Lowe declared a mistrial after determining prosecutorsunintentionally withheld an expert's report that a key piece ofevidence had been altered.   GAF, two subsidiaries and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin wereindicted last July for allegedly trying to boost Union CarbideCorp.'s stock price in 1986 shortly before selling a large block ofCarbide shares. They also were charged with securities fraud, wirefraud and conspiracy.   GAF is a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building materialsmanufacturer with operations worldwide. Its chairman, Samuel J.Heyman, was named by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator inthe case.   Sherwin, 55, of Princeton, N.J., hugged his wife as the mistrialwas announced. Sweating profusely, he told reporters outside thecourtroom, ``My family and I are all just completely exhausted.''   The government had made GAF its leadoff case in a series oftrials scheduled for this year that hinge on the confessions andtestimony of Wall Street figures who already have admittedsecurities law violations.   Defense lawyers said they would fight any move by the governmentto retry the case.   ``If a jury cannot agree despite 12 days of patient deliberationsI believe it's a waste of resources to continue to try this case,''lead GAF attorney Arthur T. Liman said.   Wall Street securities fraud lawyer Stanley Arkin said themistrial indicated the government was failing in its attempt tobring criminal charges in what should be civil cases.   ``I don't think this case demonstrated any harm,'' he said. ``Itnever seemed to me like a criminal case and I don't think it is.''   Romano denied that the mistrial marked a defeat for the ManhattanU.S. attorney's office, which has brought charges in more than 50securities fraud cases since 1983.   All prior criminal frauds, including pending charges against theinvestment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., were settled throughplea bargains. Drexel agreed in December to settle securities fraudcharges unrelated to the GAF case by pleading guilty to six feloniesand paying a record $650 million.   In a separate development, the government on Wednesday obtainedits first conviction in a Drexel-related case as a jury convictedformer Drexel assistant trader Lisa Jones of perjury and obstructionof justice.   The government's case against GAF was based largely on thetestimony of Los Angeles broker Boyd L. Jefferies, an admitted felonexpected to play a key role in other securities fraud cases as partof a plea arrangement with the government.   The purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximizeGAF's profits from the planned sale of a large block of UnionCarbide stock after a failed takeover of the much larger chemicalconcern earlier in 1986.   Defense lawyers branded Jefferies a crook who had schemedillegally with Boesky, who paid $100 million to settle insidertrading charges in late 1986. Boesky fingered Jefferies, 58, wholast year agreed to plead guilty to two securities law violations.   Jefferies' testimony is seen as crucial to separateBoesky-derived cases against speculator Salim B. Lewis and takeoverspecialist Paul Bilzerian.   On the ninth day of deliberations, the jury reported an 11-1split but resumed discussions after the judge asked them toreconsider their positions in the interests of reaching a verdict.   It was not known whether the lone juror was for acquittal orconviction, but some jurors clearly changed their minds, leading tothe three-way deadlock.   GAF and the two subsidiaries faced maximum fines totaling $12million, or $500,000 on each of eight counts against each of thethree. Sherwin faced 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $2million.</TEXT></DOC>
