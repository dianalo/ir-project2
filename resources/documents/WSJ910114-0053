Two large surveys, one in 1972 and the other in 1988,asked where people preferred to live: in cities of 50,000 ormore, within 30 miles of such cities, or in rural or otherareas far from cities. Sociologists Glenn Fuguitt of theUniversity of Wisconsin and David Brown of Cornell found thatthe proportion preferring to live where they currently livedhad increased to 50% in 1988 from 43% earlier.   A major reason was an increase in city residents who likedliving there. In 1972, less than half the city dwellers saidthey preferred urban life, but six out of ten did by 1988.The increase was particularly strong among those inmedium-sized cities.   Considerably fewer of the 1988 city residents said theywould prefer to live just outside the city. The percentage ofurbanites hankering for small-town life also dropped a bit.   Nonetheless, many Americans still weren't living wherethey would like. In 1988, only 30% of the respondents saidthey wanted to live in cities, but 41% of the U.S. populationactually lived in such settings. Exactly half of thosesurveyed in 1988 preferred towns or rural areas near a city,but only 39% of all Americans actually lived in those places.One out of five opted for more remote areas, just about theactual population there.   Only half the people indicating a preference for a placeother than their current residence said they would feel thatway even if the change involved a 10% drop in family income.   In general, the researchers state, recent large shifts inpopulation among city, near-city and rural areas appear&quot;driven much more by . . . economic and structural changesthan by changes in residential preferences.&quot;                                                                                                          Parental Nest Still Gives   Aid to Young Adults                                                                                                          MOST YOUNG adults continue to get significant help fromtheir parents: money, services, and advice and moral support.   Peter Uhlenberg of the University of North Carolina andTeresa Cooney of the University of Delaware studied repliesfrom over 7,000 people between the ages of 20 and 64 and notliving with either parent. These men and women reportedwhether they had received a parental gift or loan of morethan $200 during the preceding five years, parental servicessuch as babysitting or household chores during the precedingmonth, or advice or moral or emotional encouragement withinthe previous month.   Surprisingly, those in their late 20s received more favorsthan those in their early 20s. Almost one in three had gottenfinancial help, better than one in three had received childcare or other services, and more than two in five werebenefiting from advice or other moral or emotional support.   From then on, however, parental provision of services andother nonfinancial support drops steadily -- slowly while thechildren are in their early 30s and then somewhat moresharply. By age 45, fewer than one in 20 is getting servicehelp and only one in five is still getting advice andencouragement. Financial help continues on through thechildren's 30s before declining.   Mr. Uhlenberg and Ms. Cooney also note that daughters getmore parental services and advice than sons do, but bothsexes receive loans and gifts of money at just about the samerate.                                                                                                          Affirmative Action Lost   Some Steam in Mid-'70s                                                                                                          FEDERAL affirmative-action programs produced gains forblack men, but these gains were largely over by the early1970s, a Rand Corp. economist reports.   Between 1966 and 1974, companies covered by federal equalopportunity legislation employed a steadily increasingproportion of all black male workers, says economist James P.Smith -- from less than half in 1966 to almost two-thirdseight years later. The increase was particularly large inmanagerial and professional jobs. After 1974, however, theproportion working in covered employment tapered off.   As to the wage effects of affirmative action, he discovers&quot;no significant long-term impact&quot; for the average blackworker, though some permanent gains for college graduates.Early on, there was &quot;a remarkable surge&quot; in the income ofyoung black males, especially recent college graduates. Butafter covered firms reached their target numbers of blackworkers -- after about 1972, he says -- wage gains eroded andthe gap between black male wages and white male wages widenedto about where it had been before.   Mr. Smith's conclusion: Increased black employment atcovered firms was clearly &quot;affirmative-action induced,&quot; andthat was a net gain even though the wage gap widened againlater. Covered companies usually have more stable employmentplus pensions and other fringe benefits.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          WOMEN ENGAGED in intercollegiate gymnastics suffersubstantially higher injury and disability rates than theirmale counterparts, an Ohio State University medical groupsays. It found no difference in rates, however, between menand women involved in college basketball, swimming, tennis,track, fencing or volleyball. . . . Students over the age of24 accounted for nearly 40% of all college and universityenrollment in 1988, compared with 33% in 1974, according tothe American Council on Education. But, it adds, the changeis due largely to the increased size of the over-24population rather than an increase in its college-going rate.</TEXT></DOC>
