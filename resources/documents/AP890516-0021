The substances are crucial to Navy vessels and airplanes and itwill take two or three decades to replace them, the service saidMonday.   Forcing the Navy to use other chemicals in the near future mighthurt the service's mission of national defense, Navy officials said.   In written testimony to a House Energy and Commercesubcommittee, the Navy said it uses four chlorofluorocarbons _CFC's _ as refrigerants and cleaning agents and two relatedchemicals as firefighting agents.   ``These chemicals allow us to cool, protect and clean vitalelectronics and weapons systems,'' the Navy told Rep. John D.Dingell, chairman of the panel's investigations subcommittee. ``Wecannot over-emphasize the importance of these chemicals to ourmission performance.''   ``Given the current absence of acceptable substitutes and thelong lead times needed to change major shipboard systems, we do notforesee complete elimination of these chemicals on Navy ships for20 to 30-years.''   Ozone-depleters are chemicals which are non-toxic when releasedinto the atmosphere, but which break apart into other chemicalsubstances 10 to 100 years later as they slowly build up and rise15 to 20 miles into the stratosphere.   Scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone, allowing moreof the sun's ultraviolet rays to reach earth, causing more skincancer and eye cataracts, and suppressing human immune systems.   Dingell's panel heard testimony from Bush administrationwitnesses to assess progress of the Montreal Protocol, aninternational agreement that commits the United States and othersigners to a 50 percent reduction in production and consumption ofozone-depleting chemicals by 1998.   President Bush has said the United States prefers to negotiatewith signatory countries for a total phase-out by the end of thecentury if safe alternatives are available.   An Environmental Protection Agency official testified that theadministration will strictly police industry testing of CFCsubstitutes to make sure proposed replacements are safe. Theposition was a major policy change.   William Rosenberg, assistant administrator of air and radiation,said EPA will now require chemical firms to report results ofhealth and safety tests of the substitutes, and would not hesitateto order more tests if they are warranted.   Dingell said he was worried the EPA was rushing to approvealternatives to chlorofluorocarbons without ensuring their safety.   Two months ago, the General Accounting Office sharply rebukedEPA, saying the agency was relying too much on voluntarycooperation by the chemical industry to provide EPA with testresults on proposed substitutes.   ``It is a bit of shift,'' said EPA spokesman Chris Rice ofRosenberger's statement. ``It means we're taking the affirmativestep of requiring firms to report data on toxicity of CFCsubstitutes.''   An EPA source, speaking only on condition he not be named, said:``We were taking lot of grief. We didn't think the grief wasjustified, and we're taking the path of least resistance.''</TEXT></DOC>
