Officials said that President Roh Tae-woo plans to releasedissidents from prison after the Olympics.   Students from several colleges in the Seoul area took part inthe rally at Hongik University and said they would ``not sit idle''during the Olympics. But they did not say if they would attempt todisrupt the Games.   ``We oppose the Olympics, which only help dictator RohTae-woo,'' the students shouted.   Government officials are concerned radicals may stage protestsduring the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 event. The radicals have little publicsupport and have been strongly criticized by many Koreans in recentweeks for staging violent demonstrations.   The one-hour rally and short march today were peaceful. Dozensof students took up positions in front of the school for possibleclashes with police, but riot police stayed away.   The students shouted slogans supporting North Korea's demand tobe a co-host at the Games.   ``Let's advance national unification by co-hosting theOlympics!'' the students chanted.   North Korea has said it will boycott the Olympics unless it isallowed to be a co-host. The International Olympic Committee saidthe Games cannot be shared because they are awarded to a singlecity.   Radical students, a small but powerful minority on campuses, areseeking to topple the Roh government. They have become increasinglypro-leftist as they have lost support among most students and otherKoreans following broad democratic reforms by the government.   South Korea and North Korea have been bitter rivals since thepeninsula was divided at the end of World War II. They fought theKorean War of 1950-53 that left more than 1 million people dead.   Government party officials said Roh made the agreement to freepolitical prisoners during political talks with party chairman YoonGil-joong at the presidential residence. The officials, speaking oncondition of anonymity, did not specify how many prisoners would befreed.   In a series of recent meetings, Kim Dae-jung and three otheropposition leaders urged Roh to speed democratic reforms andrelease all political prisoners.   Hundreds of political prisoners have been freed since nationwideprotests in 1987 forced the government to accept opposition demandsfor reforms.   Opposition parties contend more than 500 dissidents still areimprisoned or facing trial for anti-government activity orpolitical beliefs. The government claims fewer than 100 dissidentsremain in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
