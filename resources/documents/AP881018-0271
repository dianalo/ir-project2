By banding together, the big computer makers gained morebargaining power in the contest with the Open Software Foundation,a group that includes International Business Machines Corp.,Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.   Unix is portrayed by enthusiasts as a great hope of the computerindustry because it would allow programs to run on a wide varietyof computers without expensive alteration.   However, the struggle over Unix has soured computer buyers, whofear the standard is being split in two. Programs written to workwith one version of Unix might not run on computers that useanother version.   Both sides in the contest say they want to unify Unix, but theATandamp;T group insists that ATandamp;T's Unix System V Release 4.0 shouldserve as the basis, while the Open Software Foundation says IBM'sversion, AIX, should be the core.   The ATandamp;T alliance scored a small victory when the Open SoftwareFoundation indicated Tuesday that there might be room forcompromise. Until now it has made its insistence on IBM's AIX anon-negotiable point.   ``Nothing has changed on that right now,'' Open SoftwareFoundation spokesman Gary McCormack said. ``But that doesn't meanthe world can't change tomorrow. Please bear with us.''   A meeting between ATandamp;T and the Open Software Foundation wasscheduled for later in the week, probably Friday, McCormack said.   The new group rallying around ATandamp;T's version of Unix is made upof 18 companies, including giants such as Unisys Corp., NCR Corp.,Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. and Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. SpA.   The Open Software Foundation was created earlier this yearbecause of concerns that ATandamp;T was manipulating Unix so it would bebest suited to run on its own computers and those of itsfast-growing Silicon Valley partner, Sun Microsystems Inc.   But supporters of ATandamp;T's version of Unix, known as System VRelease 4.0, say ATandamp;T has taken steps to ensure that othercompanies and customers have a big say in the development of Unix.   ``What ATandamp;T has done is resolve those issues,'' Jan Lindelow,senior vice president for marketing and services at Unisys, said inan interview.   Among the other companies that have joined the new group areAmdahl Corp., Control Data Corp., Gould Inc., Intel Corp., MotorolaInc., Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. SpA, Prime Computer Inc. andJapan's Toshiba Corp.   Intel and two smaller companies are members of both groups. ``Wedon't play favorites,'' said Kevin Teixeira, an Intel spokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
