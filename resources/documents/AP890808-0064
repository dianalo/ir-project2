In all, 13,000 members of the National Union of Metalworkers ofSouth Africa at four automobile plants and two vehicle componentfactories are not working due to strikes or lockouts. Industryofficials say the closed plants produce about two-thirds of SouthAfrica's motor vehicles.   About 5,000 workers are on strike at Volkswagen's plant inUitenhage, about 3,600 workers from the Toyota plant near Durbanhave been locked out and fired, and about 3,000 workers are onstrike at two plants of the South African Motor Corp., whichproduces Fords and Mazdas.   On Monday, British-owned Eveready locked out 800 workers at itsUitenhage plant because of a wage dispute. Goodyear followed suiton Tuesday, saying the 1,200 workers who have been on strike forfive weeks at its factory in Port Elizabeth would be fired unlessthey signed an undertaking by Friday that they would acceptemployment conditions proposed by the South African management inthe wake of disinvestment by the U.S. parent company.   The strikes against the three auto manufacturers, which beganlast week, are linked to the union's ongoing efforts to negotiate awage agreement on a nationwide basis with all major auto companies.Toyota has been the most adamant in resisting such negotiations,and says its dismissed workers will lose all chance to reclaimtheir jobs unless they reapply by Monday.   Auto manufacturers not yet affected by the current wave of labordisputes include Nissan, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.</TEXT></DOC>
