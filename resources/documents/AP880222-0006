He criticized them for theirstyle as well as their sexual dalliances.   ``God deliver us from these pompadour boys, hair done, nailsdone, fresh from the beauty shop, preaching the gospel,'' hethundered in March at a California crusade.   Swaggart, who temporarily stepped down from his own ministrySunday amid allegations of sexual misconduct, has a less polished,more explosive fundamentalist style. It sprang, perhaps, from hisupbringing in Ferriday, a backwater town in northern Louisiana'sBible belt.   It was there, he has said, when he first heard the call of God _a voice that gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle.   He was 8 years old.   ``Everything seemed different after that day in front of theArcade Theater,'' he said in a 1985 interview. ``I felt betterinside. Almost like taking a bath.''   He grew up poor and learned to play the piano and sing alongwith two cousins who took different paths _ rock singer Jerry LeeLewis and country singer Mickey Gilley.   Part-time preaching and part-time work in oil fields providedhis living until he was 23, when he gave up the oil work. Hepreached, played piano and sang gospel songs with all thebarrelhouse fervor of his cousin Jerry Lee at Assemblies of Godrevivals and camp meetings for 16 years before starting a radioshow that launched his broadcast evangelism career.   He was always outspoken.   In literature issued by his ministry he calls Roman Catholicism``a false religion. It is not the Christian way. Whosoever followsits errant doctrines will be deceived and end up eternally lost.''   Of Jews, he wrote that ``because of their rejection of Christ... they have known sorrow and heartache like have no other peopleon the face of the Earth.''   ``If you don't like what I say, talk to my boss!'' he shoutedonce as he strode in front of his congregation at his FamilyWorship Center, where his sermons often move listeners to stand upas though possessed by the Holy Spirit and start speaking intongues.   Offensive to some, Swaggart's messages still moved many.Contributors built Jimmy Swaggart Ministries into a growth industrythat made an estimated $142 million in 1986. Swaggart said in 1985that his complex in Baton Rouge _ including a worship center, Biblecollege and state-of-the-art broadcasting and recording facilities_ was worth up to $75 million.   Swaggart has said the PTL scandals of last year hurtfund-raising because the public painted all evangelists with abroad brush.   As the scandal broke, Swaggart assured his followers that hewouldn't fall into the same trap as Bakker and Gorman, a NewOrleans minister.   In his Baton Rouge worship center in March he told his flockthat if he were ever unfaithful to his wife, Frances, she would``kill me before God could even get to me.''   On Sunday, Swaggart never specifially responded to reports thathe, too, had been accused of sexual misconduct, specificallyconsorting with a prostitute. But, as his tearful followers lookedon, he turned to his wife and said, ``God never gave a man a betterhelpmate, a companion to stand beside him. I have sinned againstyou and I beg your forgiveness.''</TEXT></DOC>
