At the start of the three-day gathering Friday, conventioneersdecked out in berets, flak jackets and camouflage pants sat aroundthe pool of the Sahara Hotel amid bikini-clad sunbathers. Othersrubbed shoulders with civilian gamblers at the bars and slotmachines.   An estimated 10,000 delegates could choose from seminars on suchhot spots as Central America and Afghanistan, manufacturers'displays and a shooting competition at a desert range.   As usual, the big hit was the annual display of weapons andapparel designed especially for those spoiling for a fight.   ``It features a lot of things your mother probably didn't wantyou to play with when you were growing up,'' said Bill Brooks,exhibition director at the convention, which is put on by Soldier ofFortune magazine of Boulder, Colo.   The show, he said, is keyed to the interests of the``professional adventurer.''   Elsewhere in the country, people are campaigning to rid thecivilian populace of semiautomatic weapons. But in the hotel's mainexhibition hall, convention-goers trooped to booths featuring thelatest in rapid-fire armament.   Street Sweeper Sales of Atlanta touted a line of automaticweapons with a banner picturing an ominous looking weapon.   ``The Street Sweeper _ Delivers 12 rounds in less than 3Seconds,'' the sign said. ``Buy American _ It matters.''   Salesman Sherman Yarborough said the featured firearm is usedmainly for police work and by Florida law agencies against drugsmugglers and dealers.   Some Street Sweepers are used for ``self protection,'' Yarboroughsaid, adding it's ``like any gun. Each person has a different usefor them.''   Yarborough said his company sells only to licensed gun dealers.   Several booths, including one set up by the National RifleAssociation, urged attendees to fight efforts at gun control.   Posters, T-shirts and bumper stickers carried a similar theme.   One poster pictured a man with a cache of guns and a message:``Make all the laws you want _ you ain't taking mine!''   Nearby was a stack of bumper stickers reading ``WAR _ Mankind'soldest contact sport.''   Camouflage was the uniform of the day. Several booths offered``camo'' clothing including pants, jackets, hats _ even bikiniswimsuits and women's lingerie.   Outside, a motor home sported a camouflage paint job.   T-shirt slogans ran along the lines of ``Kill a Commie forMommy,'' and ``I don't dial 911'' next to a picture of a gun.   One booth bristled with dozens of official-looking laminated IDcards, including Police, Press, Swat Team, Security and OrdainedMinister. A sign read ``America is at Peace because the CIA is atWar.''   Among the hundreds of books offered were a manual on the care andoperation of the AK-47 assault rifle and a volume entitled, ``Armedand Female: 12 million American women own guns. Should you?''   Some exhibitors were reluctant to talk to reporters. A salesmanfor Miami-based Intratec referred questions to his home office whenasked about the company's .22-caliber Scorpion automatic pistol.   CEP, Inc. of Boulder, Colo., was hawking videos on such subjectsas terrorist weapons and making various explosives.   Wayne's Gun Shop of Dublin, Calif., showcased a new bullet withenhanced destructive power. The promotional literature described it:``On impact, a pre-cut, precision forged metal projectile opens intowhirlpool-creating, chopping blades.''   Airpower Sabot Cannons of Boulder City, Nev., demonstrated anair-powered gun that's fired while resting on a person's shoulder.Potential ammunition included steel or lead balls, steelprojectiles, bean bags, paint balls and water balloons.   ``Kill it, capture it, mark it, rescue it, scare it, intimidateit, supress it, sink it,'' read the brochure.</TEXT></DOC>
