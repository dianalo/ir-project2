Officials of the 12-nation European Economic Community will pressto have the duties declared in violation of international traderules at a meeting today of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade in Geneva. The 96-nation GATT offers a forum for settlingtrade disputes among its members.   Meanwhile, a flurry of visits among high-level officials from theUnited States and the Common Market trading bloc were scheduled inthe coming weeks, giving both sides a fresh chance to resolve thestubborn dispute.   Frans Andriessen, the EEC's top trading official, was scheduledto travel to Washington Feb. 17-18 for talks with the new Bushadministration, while the community's agriculture chief, RayMacSharry, was planning a trip later in the month, spokesmen saidTuesday.   The new U.S. secretary of state, James A. Baker III, was slatedto stop in Brussels on an upcoming swing through Western Europe.   The officials will no doubt discuss the troublesome disputesparked Jan. 1 when the Europeans imposed a ban on imports of meatfrom cattle treated with growth hormones, a common U.S. practice.   The United States has refused to comply with the prohibition,which the Europeans say was drawn up for health reasons. Inretaliation for the ban, the Reagan administration set 100 percenttariffs on European boneless beef, pork hams and shoulders and avariety of other European products. The sanctions are worth about$100 million.   The trading bloc protested the retaliatory measures and filed acomplaint with GATT, saying that the ``unilateral action'' taken bythe United States ``is not compatible with GATT rules andprocedures.''   It asked the international body ``to examine this matter and ...make a ruling on the legal issues and recommend appropriate action.''   GATT members could rule on the dispute at Wednesday's meeting,but officials said such a quick decision was unlikely. They raisedthe possibility that the issue could be referred to a three-memberpanel for study. The panels generally take about six months to reacha finding.   Foreign ministers representing the EEC nations warned last monththat they would impose counterretaliatory measures on imports ofU.S. walnuts and dried fruit if the two sides failed to move quicklyto end the dispute.   The ministers delayed implementing the sanctions to give moretime to settle the conflict. They are scheduled to meet Feb. 20 onthe matter.   The hormone ban was set to go into effect Jan. 1, 1988, but theEEC agreed to a one-year delay. It refused additional U.S. appealsfor postponement.   The Europeans contend the growth stimulants pose a health risk, acontention the United States disputes.   The prohibition is expected to block the importation of about$100 million worth of U.S. beef and beef byproducts.   The disputed goods represent a small chunk of the estimated $166billion in trade last year between the United States and thecommunity, whose members are: France, West Germany, Italy,Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland,Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.</TEXT></DOC>
