In a proxy statement, Citicorp said Prince Al-Waleed binTalal filed a request with the Federal Reserve Board toconvert a private issue of preferred shares into 9.6% ofCiticorp's common while retaining the 4.8% common stake henow holds.</LP><TEXT>   The move, if approved by regulatory agencies and thencompleted, would make Prince Al-Waleed the largest Citicorpshareholder. Wellington Management Co. of Boston is now thelargest shareholder, with an 8.05% stake in the common.   A Fed spokesman said the agency received the request butcouldn't comment on its contents.   Prince Al-Waleed had told the Fed he would file a noticewith it if he decided not to sell the 4.8% of common shareshe already owns and limit his holdings to under 10%. Thediscussions with the Fed were in connection with the prince'sacquisition of convertible preferred shares for $590 millionfrom Citicorp in February 1991. Under the acquisition, theprince can't hold more than 15% of the common for the nextfour years.   The proxy statement, which was mailed to shareholdersyesterday, also said Citicorp's top two executives receivedno salary increases in 1991, reflecting dismal results forthe largest bank in the U.S.   In the proxy statement, Citicorp said its chairman, JohnS. Reed, received $1,220,000 in compensation while Richard S.Braddock, its president, was compensated $848,000 in 1991. Nobonuses were awarded to members of the senior managementteam, although some gained slight salary increases. NeitherMr. Reed nor the top four officials received bonuses for1990, either. The last time Mr. Reed received a bonus underthe company's incentive compensation plan was 1989, when hegot $455,000.   The drawback on executive compensation resulted fromCiticorp's loss of $457 million last year because of problemswith commercial real estate. Last week, the bank said in itsannual report that it expects losses from troubled loans toremain high in 1992.</TEXT></DOC>
