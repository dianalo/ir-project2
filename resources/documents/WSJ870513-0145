The energy drilling company said the sale of the properties is likely to result in a charge in the third-quarter.    Reading has wanted to sell its foreign energy properties ever since oil prices plunged more than a year ago. The company said it wants to focus on its onshore energy reserves in the U.S. Earlier this year, it announced that it sold its oil and natural gas producing interests in Indonesia for $60.1 million. Reading also has sold substantially all its pipeline construction operations and has been trying to sell its coal business.    The company had a year-earlier net loss of $20.7 million, which included a $3 million loss from discontinued operations. Revenue in the first-quarter slid about 40% to $28.9 million from $47.8 million in the year-earlier quarter.    John Breitenstein, Reading controller, said the company is reviewing offers for its Australian interests but he didn't elaborate. He estimated that a sale would be in the $18 million to $20 million range. However, since the properties will be sold at a loss it would result in a charge.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Reading closed at $5.25, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
