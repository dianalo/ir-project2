We consider the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Europe as the most likely areas for these attacks, although no area can be completely precluded as an area of operation.&quot;    State Department, Pentagon and intelligence officials all refused to explain what prompted the warning, which amplifies a more general alert issued earlier this year. In addition to diplomatic posts, the latest warning has been sent to U.S. military bases, international airlines, U.S. energy companies and other multinational businesses.    In 1986, while the Reagan administration was secretly selling U.S. arms to Iran, some officials insisted that Tehran had stopped supporting terrorism, at least temporarily. Since the collapse of the secret policy, U.S. officials have issued several warnings of possible Iranian terrorist attacks. So far, none have taken place, however.    But some U.S. analysts, speaking on the condition that they not be identified, said they now expect Iran to retaliate against the U.S. for last month's naval clash in the Persian Gulf, for a decision last week to expand U.S. protection of commercial shipping in the gulf, and for mounting tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia. On Sunday, Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of the Iranian parliament, blamed Saudi Arabia's refusal to approve cuts in oil production at last weekend's OPEC meeting on &quot;flagrant treachery&quot; by the U.S.    U.S. officials claimed there have been recent indications of a resurgence of Iranian-sponsored terrorism. A senior State Department official said the Iranians have mounted 11 attacks against Saudi Arabian targets in the past two months, and asserted that there is growing evidence of active Iranian complicity in last month's hijacking of a Kuwaiti jetliner.    According to this official, whose account was confirmed by an Arab diplomatic source, the crew of the hijacked Kuwaiti jumbo jet has reported that after the plane entered Iranian airspace, the hijackers ordered them to turn right and to fly some 850 miles inland to the Iranian city of Mashad, out of reach of any rescue attempt. &quot;They are expecting us,&quot; one of the terrorists reportedly told the crew. Fifty miles from their destination, the crew recalled, one of the hijackers radioed the control tower at Mashad and told air traffic controllers: &quot;Your authorities are expecting us.&quot;    Some private analysts believe the apparent resurgence of Iranian terrorism may be linked to elections now under way in Iran. Robin Wright of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, for instance, argues that the most radical, anti-Western officials, including Interior Minister Ali-Akbar Mohtashami, are hoping that by increasing friction with the U.S. they'll be able to expand their power in parliamentary runoff elections May 13.    Other analysts, however, believe most Iranian officials, bedeviled by recent setbacks in their war with Iraq and now by their inability to raise oil prices, are united in supporting terrorism. </TEXT></DOC>
