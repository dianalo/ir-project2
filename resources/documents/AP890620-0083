Gorbachev today during an official visitdesigned to strengthen ties between the nations.   Rafsanjani, also acting commander-in-chief or the armed forces,is the highest-ranking official of the Islamic Republic to visit itsnorthern neighbor since the 1979 Islamic revolution. He also isexpected to seek military aid.   He was greeted by Gorbachev on his arrival today at the GrandKremlin Palace and the two leaders promptly adjourned to the ornatecrystal-lit St. Catherine's Hall for discussions, the official Tassnews agency said.   ``In the Soviet Union there is confidence that the visit byRafsanjani will give fresh impetus to the continued progress ofSoviet-Iranian relations ... and will help improve mutualunderstanding and strengthen cooperation between the twocountries,'' it said.   Tass said the Soviet Union was intent on developing strongrelations with Iran ``despite essential ideological differencesbetween the two countries.''   Relations ``have grown especially strong lately,'' it said,crediting the late Ayatollah Khomeini for the improvement. Khomeini,the fundamentalist leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, died on June3.   Before leaving Tehran, Rafsanjani expressed hope that the visit,delayed since last fall, would open ``a new chapter inIranian-Soviet relations and in the history of the region,'' saidthe official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.   On his return Rafsanjani is to stop in Hungary and Bulgaria tocomplete 10-year cooperation agreements that include aid to Iran'sgrowing arms industry.   Rafsanjani was accompanied by Foreign Minister Ali AkbarVelayati, Commander of the Revolutionary Guards Corps Mohsen Rezaie,Minister of Heavy Industries Behzad Nabavi, representatives of sevenother ministries and a number of parliamentary deputies, IRNA said.   Mohammad Javad Iravani, minister of economic and financialaffairs, preceded him to Moscow to complete the groundwork forsigning a number of agreements, IRNA said.   Iran officially has a non-aligned foreign policy, but Rafsanjanisaid soon after Khomeini died that Iran's spiritual leader had toldhim to press ahead with improving ties with Moscow.   With ties to the West still strained, Iran is looking to theSoviet bloc for help in rebuilding Iran following its eight-year warwith Iraq.   Relations between the two countries soured soon after the Iranianrevolution with the Soviet intervention in neighboring Afghanistanand the 1981 Iranian repression of the Tudeh Communist party.   The Soviet Union was one of Iraq's major arms suppliers in theIran-Iraq war that ended in a tentative truce in August.   Iranian-Soviet relations improved with the Soviet withdrawal fromAfghanistan. In January, Khomeini appealed to Gorbachev to look toIslam for the solution to the Soviet Union's political and economicstagnation.</TEXT></DOC>
