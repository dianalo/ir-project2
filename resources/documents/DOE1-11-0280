The interfacebetween a magnetic cloud and its surrounding medium separates the internaland external magnetic fields. Polarization currents are induced in theperipheral layer to make the ambient magnetic field tangential. The motionof a magnetic cloud through the interplanetary medium may be partitionedinto a translational motion of the magnetic cloud as a whole and an expansivemotion of the volume relative to the axis of the magnetic cloud. Thetranslational motion is determined by two kinds of forces, i.e., thegravitational force exerted by the Sun, and the hydromagnetic buoyancyforce exerted by the surrounding medium. On the other hand, the expansivemotion is determined by the pressure gradient sustaining the gross differencebetween the internal and external pressures and by the self-induced magneticforce that results from the interaction among the internal currents.The force resulting from the internal and external currents is a partof the hydromagnetic buoyancy force, manifested by a thermal stress causedby the inhomogeneity of the ambient magnetic pressure.</TEXT></DOC>
