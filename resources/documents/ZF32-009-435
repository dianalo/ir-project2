As a member of therenegade Apache Group and a 3.6% investor in Unix Labs, it is thought thatNEC wants System V.4 for its MIPS boxes.andP;  NEC is activating a strategicoperation it quietly put in place back in April to handle these developments:the Open Systems Technology Center in Princeton geographically near both UnixLabs and Unix International (CI No 1,802).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
