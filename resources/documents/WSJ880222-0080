It's not surprising that the public is confused about the debt. When Mr. Reagan ran for president in 1980, he compared it to a stack of $1,000 bills 67 miles high. In the years since then, as he and Congress have repeatedly denounced the deficit, that stack has risen to 167 1/2 miles. Still, people appear indifferent. Maybe they just don't want to acknowledge the scope of the problem.    Or, more likely, they simply can't comprehend an amount of money as large as $2.5 trillion. Most Americans earn $12,000 to $60,000 a year to cover housing, transportation, appliances, repairs and maintenance, food, clothes, medical bills and insurance, raising and educating children, among other various necessities and occasional small luxuries, and, of course, to pay taxes. I have trouble enough figuring out how someone would spend $46 million in lottery winnings. A million or two would suffice for me and my extended family. Even the late Sen. Everett Dirksen's aphorism (&quot;A billion here and a billion there and pretty soon you're talking about real money&quot;) doesn't illuminate the subject anymore.    What's needed is something people can relate to. A penny, for example. You're familiar with pennies -- those little shiny, copper coins we fumble for in our pockets and purses to make change, or store away in jars, or sometimes find lying on the street.    There are 250 trillion pennies in the national debt, which now weighs 850,340,136 tons. It would require 8,503,401 boxcars carrying 100-ton loads to transport the national debt. Or, seen another way, it would take 17,006,802,720 people -- 3 1/2 times the world population -- bearing 100-pound loads each, to carry the pennies.    Our national debt is ethereal, too: At 232,100,416 miles, it already reaches more than half way to Jupiter. And it is substantial: Two hundred-fifty trillion pennies would cover 35,029 square miles -- an area the size of Maryland, Rhode Island and West Virginia.    Figure in nongovernmental debt and you'll have an additional $7 trillion that Americans owe. That's an extra 2,380,952,414 tons of pennies. If you prefer paper money, the pile of $1,000 bills would grow to 636 miles. In pennies, it would extend beyond Saturn -- a total of 881,981,581 miles -- or cover another 98,082 square miles. Oops! There goes Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.    But not to worry. It would take 25,261,323,898,060,800 pennies to cover the United States. Small change, indeed!    ---   Mr. Martin is a free-lance writer in Salem, Ore. </TEXT></DOC>
