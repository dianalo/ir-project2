The new exposure ceilings would apply to 17 million workers and &quot;significantly&quot; lower disease risk from on-the-job hazards for about 3.7 million workers currently subjected to exposure levels that are higher than the proposed ceilings, the department said.    The department estimated the regulations would cost employers $900 million a year, and that employers would be given four years to comply with them.    The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the department unit that oversees workplace health hazards, estimated the new limits would reduce deaths from job-related cancer, liver and kidney impairments, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases by 500 a year, the incidence of those diseases by 50,000 cases a year, and the number of lost workdays by as much as 500,000 a year.    The generalized method of setting limits for worker exposure to chemicals has been on OSHA drawing boards for a year, officials said. &quot;The substance-by-substance approach cannot keep up with the number of chemicals in the market,&quot; OSHA chief John Pendergrass said at a news conference.    In recent testimony before the Senate Labor Committee, Michael Baroody, an assistant secretary of labor for policy, said that in its 17 years of existence, OSHA has issued 47 final rules of any type, 20 in the past three years. If OSHA continued setting limits for one chemical at a time, &quot;then the best we can hope for is a few final rules a year on a few specific toxic substances a year,&quot; he said.    Mr. Pendergrass likened the move to the agency's recently issued &quot;hazard communication&quot; rules, which require employers to give workers a list of any hazardous chemicals to which they've been exposed. Those rules were issued under court pressure.

In recent testimony before the Senate Labor Committee, Michael Baroody, an assistant secretary of labor for policy, said in its 19 years of existence, OSHA has issued 47 final rules, 20 in the past three years. If OSHA continued setting limits for one chemical at a time, &quot;then the best we can hope for is a few final rules a year on a few specific toxic substances a year,&quot; he said.    Mr. Pendergrass likened the move to the agency's recently issued &quot;hazard communication&quot; rules, which require employers to give workers a list of any hazardous chemicals to which they've been exposed. Those rules were issued under court pressure.    The AFL-CIO said by adopting almost wholesale the industrial hygienists' guidelines, the OSHA proposal will affect many substances &quot;that are not of primary concern,&quot; while leaving out some of the &quot;worst actors&quot; as far as usage and toxicity. &quot;We don't want to see quantity over quality,&quot; said Diane Factor, an AFL-CIO industrial hygienist. She also said the proposal doesn't cover millions of workers in the maritime, construction and agricultural industries.    Franklin Mirer, safety and health director of the United Auto Workers, called the proposal a &quot;scatter-gun approach&quot; that makes small changes in regulations, and that could foreclose rule-making on more dangerous chemicals.    Michael Wright, a United Steelworkers official, voiced the concern that angry chemical makers might sue OSHA, and a court battle could tie up the proposal for years. The union prefers that a coalition of labor and industry interests create guidelines that would be less vulnerable to litigation, Mr. Wright said.    The proposal would update many standards, which were set in 1968, reducing exposure limits for 234 chemicals, such as chloroform, carbon monoxide and ammonia. It would also set first limits for another 168 chemicals, including naptha, asphalt fumes, wood dust and vinyl acetate.    Mr. Pendergrass said he expects the final rules to be issued in November. Public comments on the proposal will be accepted through July 8, and a public hearing will be held July 20. </TEXT></DOC>
