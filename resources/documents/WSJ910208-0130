Based on Justice Departmentvictimization surveys, felon surveys, the NationalAssociation of Chiefs of Police law-enforcement survey,Promis studies, research by the Rand Corp., and bycriminology researchers James D. Wright et al. and GaryKleck:   -- More than 99.6% of U.S. handguns will not be involvedin criminal activity in any given year.</LP><TEXT>   -- More than 90% of police chiefs and sheriffs surveyedagree that criminals are not affected by a ban on any type offirearm, while more than 70% oppose &quot;waiting periods&quot; for thesame reason.   -- A prisoner survey conducted by James D. Wright et al.found that unarmed felons listed tougher penalties for usinga gun as an important reason for not arming themselves.   -- 75%-80% of U.S. violent crimes are committed by careercriminals, many on some form of conditional or early release(30%-35% of career criminals are rearrested with previouscriminal charges still pending).   -- Gary Kleck found that using a gun for protection fromviolent crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- reduces thelikelihood that the crime will be completed and that intendedvictims will be injured.   Clearly, the issue at hand is not gun control but, rather,crime control.   According to Mr. Gartner, &quot;this year about 3,000teen-agers . . . will use handguns to kill themselves. Some9,000 adults will do the same.&quot; Suicides are, without doubt,tragic events affecting parents, families and society. Is howthese people killed themselves the real issue, or is why moreimportant? The unfortunate truth is that if a person isdesperate or depressed enough to commit suicide, he will finda way to do it. Guns or no guns.   The most important fact of all must not be overlooked.Criminals don't care about gun-control laws. They never haveand they never will.   Frank T. Iorio   Mamaroneck, N.Y.   ---   As a life member of the National Rifle Association, Iagree with Mr. Gartner -- it is not too much to ask for anationwide &quot;seven-day `cooling-off' period&quot; (the Brady Bill)to give the authorities time for background checks. As alaw-abiding citizen, it would be of comfort to know thatother potential handgun buyers would be screened and keepthose with a criminal past from owning a handgun.   The reason Washington has yet to enact serious gun-controllaws is due to the enormous voting and financial pressure ofthe pro-gun lobby. While Congress is congratulating itself onhow well it acted during the vote on the Persian Gulf war,more than 100 body bags were filled here in the U.S. due tohandgun violence. The NRA has not acted prudently and isalienating the support and respect of many legislators,police departments and its members.   James Forbes   Atlanta   ---   It is refreshing to read the actual motives of those whoclaim they simply want a waiting period for the purchase of ahandgun. Mr. Gartner has now made it abundantly clear thathis goal is the elimination of handguns from our society. Ifind it incongruous that the president of NBC News, a man whoshould believe in the broadening of constitutional rights,obviously has no regard for the Second Amendment rights tokeep and bear arms. I am sure that if there were a movementto narrow and restrict the First Amendment freedoms of thepress, he would be at the forefront of the opposition.   Mr. Gartner ignores the key issues regarding suicide andcrime. The problem is not the instrument used to kill oneselfor someone else. The problems are the breakdown of the family(black and white); an education system that fails to educate;poverty; illegal drugs, and emasculated police, justice andpenal systems. This has been the message preached by the NRAfor years. As evidenced by New York City and Washington,which have the nation's strictest gun-control laws andvirtually ban the ownership of handguns by law-abidingcitizens, Mr. Gartner's placebo doesn't work because itignores the root causes of suicide and crime.   Richard W. Bonds   Cordova, Tenn.   ---   Mr. Gartner should have read The Federalist No. 46 byJames Madison before he wrote his anti-gun diatribe. If hehad, he would understand that the constitutional guarantee ofuninfringed firearms possession is for protection againsttyranny. It has nothing to do with duck hunting or targetshooting.   Furthermore, Madison makes it clear that state militias,by the fact of their being organized, would give private armstheir greatest effectiveness in the resistance to tyranny.Otherwise, in the words of Alexander Hamilton, &quot;the citizensmust rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, withoutsystem, without resource; except in their courage anddespair.&quot; Thus the &quot;well-organized militia&quot; phrase in theSecond Amendment was not intended to restrict arms to thosein the militia -- as the anti-gun lobby would have usbelieve.   When we realize that the individual right to keep and beararms is our ultimate defense against tyranny, all of thearguments about magazine capacity, armor-piercing bullets,sporting use, etc. suddenly stand before us in their nakedfalsity.
