Although rain is naturally somewhat acidic, ``acid rain'' refersto the additional acidity added by pollutants _ sulfuric acidformed from coal-burning power plant and factory emissions, andnitric acid from power plant, factory and motor vehicle emissions.</TEXT><TEXT>   Why is it important?   Environmentalists say in eastern North America, the extra acidis killing fish and other aquatic life in lakes and streams. Also,they say, it corrodes buildings, bridges and monuments, adds tostress on declining forests and, in the form of acidic haze,reduces visibility and threatens health.</TEXT><TEXT>   What can be done?   New coal-fired power plants already must meet strict emissionsstandards, but few are being built these days. It's the largeplants in the U.S. Midwest built generally in the 1950s through themid-1970s that people are concerned about, especially since theyare lasting longer than most people figured.   New coal plants generally use ``scrubbers'' to remove the acidin the smokestack. Although 146 scrubbers are in service, fittingthem to old plants would be expensive _ several estimates say $5billion a year.</TEXT><TEXT>   Why hasn't something been done?   In part because the Reagan administration and congressionaldelegations from heavy coal-producing states maintain that moreresearch should be done first. They say not enough is known aboutthe scale of the damages to justify such massive expense.</TEXT><TEXT>   Why is Canada concerned?   Half the acid rain that falls in Canada originates in sulfurdioxide emitted by U.S. sources.</TEXT><TEXT>   What does Canada want?   Canada, U.S. states in the Northeast and environmentalists havepressed for a roughly 50 percent cut in sulfur dioxide emissions.Various bills in Congress to accomplish this have failed.   Most recently, Canada proposed a treaty that would commit theUnited States to a 44 percent reduction in the northbound flow ofsulfur dioxide.</TEXT><TEXT>   What about Canadian emissions?   Canada contributes minor amounts to U.S. acid rain _ perhaps 25percent, because of wind patterns, in the Adirondack Mountains ofNew York state. Canada has embarked on a program aimed at cuttingits own sulfur dioxide emissions 50 percent by 1994.</TEXT></DOC>
