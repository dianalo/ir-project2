Thenumerous PAH isomers of molecular weight 302, include five dibenzopyrenes,ten dibenzofluoranthenes, five napthopyrenes and eleven napthofluoranthenes.Information obtained only from the retention time and mass spectrum ofsuch a compound is seldom sufficient for unambiguous identification.Another approach to this identification problem is to utilize well-resolved,low-temperature fluorescence spectra, so-called Shpol' skii spectra,for positive identification. A large number of P*AHs exhibit fluorescencespectra consisting of sharp lines, sometimes superimposed on a continuousspectrum, when dissolved in n-alkane solvents and frozen to cryo temperatures.These spectra usually have strong individual compositions, and can thusbe used for fingerprint identification of certain compounds. As a partof an analytical system, identification by means of the Shpol' skii effectis for most part made following the trapping of peaks from chromatographicsystems (HPLC, GC or TLC). Thus, by utilizing the Shpol' skii fluorescencea large number of similar compounds (isomeric forms) can be unabiguouslyidentified and quantified in a complex sample. This paper demonstratesthe utility of the Shpol' skii effect in the analysis of dibenzopyrenesand dibenzofluoranthene.</TEXT></DOC>
