The result -- in the western German state ofRhineland-Palatinate -- will make it more difficult for theembattled German leader to push through his policies forreviving eastern Germany's economy and underscores the plungein Mr. Kohl's popularity six months after German unity.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Kohl's party has led the state ever since it wascarved from Germany's western military occupation zone 44years ago. Yesterday's result is widely viewed as a protestvote against Mr. Kohl's policies -- particularly his decisionto boost taxes after promising this wouldn't be necessary tocover the costs of unifying the two Germanys. The SocialDemocrats built their state campaign around what they callthe &quot;Bonn tax lie.&quot;   The Rhineland-Palatinate -- a hilly wine-growing regionwith only 2.9 million registered voters -- is hardly a hugeslice of the German electorate. But the timing of the vote(the first state election since formal unification) and thedomination of the campaign with national issues helped turnit into a crucial test of Mr. Kohl's policies.   Many analysts had predicted a close race, but not the routthat occurred. Carl-Ludwig Wagner, the state's defeatedconservative premier, heaped most of the blame at Mr. Kohl'sdoor -- citing not only the tax increase as a reason for theparty's poor results, but also other unpopular decisionslinked to financing German unity, such as a boost intelephone rates.   The election will make Mr. Kohl's job more difficult byrestoring the majority of Social Democrat-led states inBonn's upper house of parliament, known as the Bundesrat. Theconservatives snared a majority in the Bundesrat lastDecember, when state elections in the newly forged easternGerman states gave Mr. Kohl's party the majority. While nothaving direct legislative power, the Bundesrat, made up ofrepresentatives selected by each state, can blocklegislation, including budget decisions related to thestates. With a Social Democratic majority, the Bundesratcould become a key source of power for Bonn's oppositionparty and heavily influence the course of Germany's economicpolicies toward the east.   But while the Social Democrats came out with the largestslice of the vote -- over 45%, according to televisionprojections, which are usually accurate -- they still mustforge a coalition with one of the state's smaller parties inorder to have the absolute majority. Either theenvironmentalist Greens or the Free Democrats, the juniorpartner in Bonn's right-of-center coalition, could gotogether to form a government. Rudolf Scharping, the SocialDemocrats' candidate for premier, insisted last night that hewas open to either option and would not announce a decisionuntil after he spoke with party allies today. Similarly, bothsmaller parties left open the option of linking with theSocial Democrats.   The Christian Democrats snared 38.5% of the vote,according to television projections, virtually the same asthe Social Democrats got in the last state election in 1987and their lowest result in the state's history.   The election jolted conservative leaders throughout thecountry. &quot;This election was a clear and bitter defeat for theparty as a whole,&quot; said Volker Ruehe, the ChristianDemocrats' general secretary in Bonn.</TEXT></DOC>
