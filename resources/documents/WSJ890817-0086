She's rich, and she likes to raise money for budding capitalists. Unfortunately for cash-starved entrepreneurs, Velda Sue so far exists only on paper, some 90 pages of controversial federal legislation that Congress will be asked to consider this fall.    Velda Sue is the shorthand name for a proposed federally chartered, private corporation that would buy small-business loans from banks, package them as securities, and resell them to large investors such as pension funds and insurance companies.    The idea mimics the successful approach of government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, well-known financial nicknames. Fannie Mae is the name used for the Federal National Mortgage Association; Freddie Mac stands for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Both are federally sponsored corporations that do business in the secondary mortgage market.    Velda Sue is an acronym for Venture Enhancement and Loan Development Administration for Smaller Undercapitalized Enterprises. Rep. John LaFalce (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Small Business Committee, introduced a bill to create Velda Sue earlier this month.    In theory, Velda Sue would make it easier for small companies to borrow money, especially for real estate, plant and equipment, and other needs that require long-term borrowing.    Banks would be eager to make such loans to credit-worthy companies, knowing they could then turn around and sell the loan to Velda Sue. Without secondary markets, banks have to carry loans on their books to maturity. Since banks have government-imposed limits on overall lending, the inability to sell off loans makes banks reluctant to lend long-term. Loans that are sold in the secondary market also don't count against a bank's limits on lending to individual borrowers.    &quot;You could stimulate small business substantially with this kind of market,&quot; says Weldon Barton, a lobbyist with the Independent Bankers Association of America.    &quot;It's a great way to leverage existing funds quickly without added appropriations,&quot; adds John Paul Galles, executive vice president of National Small Business United, a Washington-based trade group. &quot;From that angle, I think it's a terrific idea and one that's long overdue.&quot;    Floyd Stoner, director of legislative operations for the American Bankers Association, says the ABA hasn't yet taken a position on the Velda Sue legislation. &quot;But as a concept, the secondary market for small-business loans is very appealing,&quot; he adds.    Government-sponsored enterprises aren't part of the federal budget, but they carry the implicit warranty of government aid in case of a loan default. It's this backstop that makes their securities attractive to investors. Velda Sue's individual securities, for example, wouldn't carry a government guarantee, but the bill allows the Treasury Department to buy as much as $1.5 billion of Velda Sue paper, subject to congressional appropriation, in a funding crisis.    Such quasi-government guarantees are a sensitive issue, especially in the wake of the multibillion-dollar savings and loan industry rescue. The recently signed Sandamp;L reorganization act requires the Treasury Department, no fan of government-sponsored corporations, to make a new study of these enterprises.    &quot;This isn't a particularly good time to float something and say, 'Trust the banks,'&quot; one House committee staff member contends.    Even Mr. Galles of National Small Business United, the trade group, has qualms about public-private financing methods. &quot;While I respect what LaFalce is trying to do, I think it's important to do a thorough evaluation of the way government guarantees, and the secondary markets support, capital formation on the federal level.&quot;    Leah Young, spokeswoman for the House Small Business Committee, concedes that Velda Sue &quot;isn't going to take off in the next couple of months.&quot; The bill, which is highly technical and subject to review by several committees, will go into hearings this fall. &quot;We think there's an opportunity here, and there are a lot of protections built in,&quot; Ms. Young says.    Projections of congressional action are mixed. &quot;This won't be a slam dunk,&quot; says Peter McNeish, president of the National Association of Small Business Investment Companies. &quot;The promoters are going to have to make a very clear distinction between the Sandamp;L situation and what this legislation would do.&quot;    There are major differences between bank and thrift regulation -- where deposits are guaranteed and federal and state regulators keep tabs on an institution's healthand the arm's length relationship that exists between the government and federally chartered corporations.    Still, Mr. Barton of the Independent Bankers Association thinks Velda Sue &quot;has a reasonably good chance&quot; of passing this session. &quot;You're not really dropping a new concept on Congress.&quot;    To be eligible for Velda Sue, the bill says, loans would have to come from small businesses with a net worth of $8 million or less and have annual, after-tax income of $2.5 million or less. Loans would have to be fully amortized and secured by a first mortgage on their collateral.    Banks would have to be shareholders in Velda Sue before they could sell loans to it. The corporation wouldn't start until it sells $30 million in stock to participating financial institutions.    The bill also would create a Velda Sue subsidiary, the Corporation for Small Business Investment, which would perform a parallel secondary market function for debentures sold by some 300 privately capitalized small-business investment companies. These investment companies, licensed by the Small Business Administration, invest in minority-owned companies and other small firms. Cosbi, as it's known, has been debated in Congress for several years but has failed to win approval as an entity of its own. </TEXT></DOC>
