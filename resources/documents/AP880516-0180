(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. exhorted 20 ofthe nation's top high school seniors Monday to ``stir 'em up'' backhome on behalf of education spending and opportunity for allchildren.   Weicker, R-Conn., said neither the Reagan administration,Congress nor the public at large was sufficiently committed toeducation.   Addressing an awards luncheon for USA Today's All-USA AcademicFirst Team, Weicker charged that none of the current presidentialcandidates has made education a cornerstone of his campaign,despite ``a few perfunctory statements'' by Vice President GeorgeBush about wanting to be ``the education president.''   ``I certainly welcome that within my own party. It will be thefirst one in a long time,'' the maverick Republican said.   ``Those of you that are the winners, do me a favor when you getback home. Stir 'em up. Stir 'em up. Tell 'em, `Whateveropportunity has been given me isn't shared by that much of thenation.' Make certain that all of our children have that specialeducation ... that brings opportunity,'' Weicker said.   ``You ask that candidate that stands up, `Are you foreducation?' And don't be satisfied when that candidate says, `I'mfor education.' Are you willing to pay for that education?''Weicker said.   ``It's easy to be against drugs, and it's easy to be foreducation. It's not so easy to pay for the war on drugs or pay foreducation,'' Weicker said.   The All-USA team was chosen by a panel of 10 educators from morethan 900 students nominated by their high school principals. Thecontest, in its second year, is co-sponsored by the NationalEducation Association and the National Association of SecondarySchool Principals.   The winners, all seniors, were 10 boys and 10 girls with averagegrades of 3.97 on a scale of 4.0, and average scores of 1,413 onthe Scholastic Aptitude Test and 31.3 on the American College Test.
