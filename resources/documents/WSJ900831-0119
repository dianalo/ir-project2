In a country that takes a perverse pride in callingitself a vulnerable island with few natural resouces? Sure,says Kazuhiko Itano, an assistant director of Japan NationalOil Corp., or JNOC. &quot;We are an oil-producing country.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Not much of one, perhaps, but hope springs eternal --though oil doesn't -- in the Japanese oil patch. So far, Mr.Fujii, Japan's chief oil driller, and his geologists atHigashi-Kubiki haven't displayed any Beverly Hillbilly luck.Three of every four wells drilled in Japan are dry. Indeed,Japan's first producing oil field wasn't found until 1891,after 18 years of dry holes.   But these days Japan's oil men feel themselves under morepressure to perform. The prospect of war in the Persian Gulfbodes ill for the economic superpower's health. Japan is theworld's second-largest oil consumer, after the U.S.,dependent on oil for two-thirds of its energy. Acutely awareof that dependence, Japan's oil companies are boring awayacross Japan with missionary zeal.   In the commuter-infested neighborhood of Chiba in suburbanTokyo, small wells squeak the night away. In the rice-farminghamlets of Niigata and Akita prefectures, where the wintersnows fall so heavily that some old wooden houses havesecond-story doors, rusted skeletons of oil rigs are common.A dozen miles off the coast of Niigata City, the flame of anoffshore oil platform burns day and night.   The Japanese quest mixes patriotism and persistence. &quot;Weare trying to make Japan more self-sufficient in energy,&quot;says an executive at a state-controlled oil company. &quot;But itmay take time.&quot;   Indeed. Japan imports 99% of its oil. Its purchasesaccount for one of every 10 barrels sold internationally. FewJapanese know that their country produces even 1% of its oil.   &quot;Most local people aren't even aware what we're doing,&quot;says Mitsunobu Sugiyama, an administrator at Japan PetroleumExploration Co., the JNOC subsidiary operating the well inHigashi-Kubiki.   But, then, there's little reason they should be. TheJapanese oil men don't draw much attention to themselves.This is no Cadillac-and-10-gallon-hat crowd. The favoritehangout near Japan Petroleum's regional headquarters inNiigata is a noodle shop where oil men shed their blue suitjackets, loosen their ties, doff their shoes and slurpseaweed noodles.   Here at Higashi-Kubiki, the only roughneck is a giantmachinery trailer with the English words &quot;Automaticroughneck&quot; stenciled on the side. Most everything isautomated, so the site requires only eight men a shift -- andan aproned lady to serve steaming green tea or iced barleytea.   The strike-it-rich atmosphere of the Texas oil patch isn'tmuch in evidence here. Toshiki Takahashi, a 24-year-oldgeologist at the Higashi-Kubiki rig, says: &quot;The job is worthdoing because we make efforts to find oil for Japan eventhough we don't know if it exists.&quot;   Actually, there is considerable evidence that it doesn't.Of the 1.33 billion barrels of oil Japan consumed in thefiscal year ended March 31, domestic wells produced only 4.12million barrels, or about 0.3%. The country's estimatedreserves are 52 million barrels; by contrast, Saudi Arabiahas 255 billion barrels.   Still, nearly everybody in the Japanese oil industry seemsto know that Norway had no onshore oil to speak of before itdiscovered vast offshore reserves in the early 1970s. Manythink they may replicate Norway's good fortune one day.   &quot;Of course there is always the possibility, a highpossibility, that we will find a large reserve because wehave this vast sea,&quot; says Takazo Ichimura, deputy manager ofJapan Petroleum's Niigata division. There's an even greaterchance, he adds, in the offshore shelf under seas that Japandoesn't control at the moment but claims, such as thosearound the Soviet-held Kuril island chain north of Japan.   Japan's hunger for oil has caused it trouble in the past.In 1941, after Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to cut offImperial Japan from the oil fields of Indonesia, Tokyoattacked Pearl Harbor and occupied Indonesia. When theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries choked theworld's oil supply in 1973, Japan's economy groundtemporarily to a halt and inflation soared. This time around,fears of an oil shortage have crippled the Tokyo StockExchange, and interest rates have begun to creep up.   Such agonies -- along with legends about Japanese emperorsa millenium ago burning oil that seeped from the ground --give oil an almost mythical importance in Japan. Thegovernment takes domestic exploration so seriously thatcomputers monitoring Mr. Fujii's 18,000-foot-deep well 200miles from Tokyo beam signals to screens at Japan Petroleum'sheadquarters, where officials of the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry can watch the progress.   Although only a few companies explore and pump oil or gasin Japan, two of them, Japan Petroleum and Teikoku Oil Co.,were started with government money. All get big subsidies, asmuch as 80%, to explore for oil in Japan.   Despite the easy money, finding young Japanese to work inthe business isn't easy. Mr. Takahashi, the geologist at theHigashi-Kubiki rig, says he was the only one of 40 geologystudents at his university to enter the oil business.Salaries are poor, it's a low-visibility industry and workconditions in the field are poor compared with the officeenvironment at other big companies, he says.   The few who choose oil do so because their country needsthem. &quot;Japan needs a stable supply of oil from Japan,&quot; saysMr. Itano of JNOC. Trying to convince the world that it willfind a real source isn't easy, though.   &quot;I used to start my speeches in Washington by telling U.S.oil people that Japan is an oil producer,&quot; he says. &quot;It madethem laugh.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
