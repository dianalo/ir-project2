Reports so far indicated infections at 75 sites worldwide by apair of viruses designed to strike Friday the 13th, said WesThomas, editor of an electronic newsletter called Virus Alert.Those 75 sites, mostly businesses and universities, account forhundreds of computers, he said.   Thomas, who set up a command center in San Francisco tocoordinate reports of the viruses and the response, said he hadn'theard of any serious damage done, but said corporate computermanagers were close-mouthed about data loss.   ``People don't want to admit that,'' Thomas said after a nightof monitoring calls.   ``It's obviously not a massive infestation,'' Thomas said,adding that most of the reported cases had yet to be checked byexperts.   Viruses are malicious programs written by techno-vandals. Thebugs are spread by unknowing users through infected computer disksor contaminated programs drawn from telephone bulletin boards orcomputer networks. They can sap computing power, fill up storagespace, devour files or make information impossible to get.   In Britain, the Royal National Institution for the Blindreported a computer malfuction that was most likely caused by avirus, according to Bernard Fleming, community education officer.   ``We found that most of our program files are gone. Every timewe try to look at a new program file it vanishes in front of oureyes,'' said Corri Barrett of the institute in London. ``It'shorrendous. Months and months of work has been wiped out here.''   In Switzerland, Bernhard Schmid, head of the federal personalcomputer team, said several dozen of the government's 3,500personal computers were found to have been carrying a virus butexperts managed to cancel and reprogram all the infected ones.   A virus was detected earlier in the week in personal computersat Mobil Corp. offices in Tyler, Texas, and Houston, said GaleMaynor, who runs the company's computer support services in Dallas.   The bug erupted early because managers advanced their computers'clocks to smoke it out, she said. Vital data was duplicated inadvance, she said.   To Thomas, the non-epidemic may have the unexpected benefit ofraising computer users' awareness of the possibility of a virus.   ``There are a number of viruses and they could hit at anytime,'' he said. ``The trouble is there are not a lot of peopletrained to recognize this.''   His advice to users who notice their machines acting strangelyis to shut the computer off and call an expert to diagnose theproblem.   About 30 viruses are known to exist. They are often triggered bycomputers' internal calendars, and Friday the 13th is a favoritetarget date.   A virus known as Datacrime or the Columbus Day virus wassupposed to be activated on the 13th. It erases a computer's``track zero,'' the part of the memory the machine uses to locatefiles.   Another that has been around for some time, called theJerusalem, the Israeli or the PLO virus, kicks in Friday the 13th.Its action is described by various computer experts as destroyingfiles or expanding applications programs, causing them tomalfunction. </TEXT></DOC>
