The most recent entry into the modest end of the market isShearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Yesterday, the American ExpressCo. unit unveiled a money-management service available toinvestors with $10,000 or more to invest. (In January, theminimum rises to $25,000.)</LP><TEXT>   Unlike most programs that manage an investor's money,Shearson's Trak Personalized Investment Advisory Servicedoesn't buy individual stocks and bonds. Instead, itallocates an investor's money among about six independentoutside money managers. These include such well-knownmanagers as Dreman Value Management and Oechsle InternationalAdvisors. Typically, the managers handle money forinstitutional investors and wealthy individuals.   All together, Shearson is using 11 outside managers, eachof which will specialize in a different type of investment,including bonds, stocks and tax-exempt securities. Forinstance, Dreman will invest in small &quot;value&quot; stocks andOechsle in foreign stocks.   The investment structure enables someone with a smallportfolio to diversify among money managers and amonghundreds of securities in the manager's portfolio.   Total costs for the service range from about 2.4% to 2.6%annually. This includes the annual management fee of 1.5% ofassets and the annual expenses on the funds, which range from0.5% for the money market fund to 1.5% for the internationalstock fund.   Leonard Reinhart, president of Shearson's ConsultingGroup, says the typical investor for the Trak program is&quot;someone in the accumulation stage&quot; with $35,000 in assets toinvest.   Other money-management options for those &quot;accumulators&quot;include wrap accounts, offered by brokerage firms includingMerrill Lynch andamp; Co., PaineWebber Inc., Prudential InsuranceCo. of America's Prudential Securities Inc. unit andShearson. Minimum investment amounts range from $50,000 to$100,000.   In wrap accounts, investors are assigned to money managersin the firm's stable, based on the customer's investmentstrategy and risk tolerance. The money manager selectsindividual stocks and bonds.   The firms &quot;wrap&quot; together the investment management feeand all transaction costs, for a flat fee of 3% of assetsannually. But competition is causing fees to soften. Somefirms allow clients to negotiate a discount, regardless ofthe size of their portfolio. This trend is likely tocontinue, especially in light of discount broker CharlesSchwab's recent announcement that it would be providing wrapaccount services next year for a fee of less than 2% ofassets annually.   Another relatively new money-management option forless-than-wealthy people is Fidelity Investment's PersonalAdvisory Service, which accepts minimum investments of$100,000.   Depending on an investor's risk tolerance and otherfactors, money is allocated among a number of Fidelity funds;portions are shifted six to eight times a year as marketconditions change.   The service charges an annual advisory fee of 1% ofassets; annual expenses on the mutual funds can range from0.5% to 1.5% or so. In addition, the funds charge onetimesales fees ranging from 1% to 3% of assets (except inretirement accounts).   The structure of Fidelity's service is similar to onecommonly used by independent investment advisers. Many chargea flat 1% of assets annually, and allocate clients' moneyamong no-load mutual funds. Advantages over Fidelity'sservice are that an independent adviser can choose mutualfunds from more than one company, and choose funds that haveno sales fee.   A drawback with some independent advisers is the potentialfor conflicts of interest. That's because these advisers findthey can make money serving the modest end of the market onlyif they place clients in investments that pay commissions.Investors may have reason to wonder whether the adviserrecommended the investment because it was the best one forthe investor, or because it offered the best commission.   These types of advisers (who may also charge an advisoryfee), typically earn commissions ranging from 4.5% to 8% onthe investments they recommend.   Investors can also get professional management by a mutualfund that divides its portfolio among a variety ofinvestments. That's what New York business owner CorinneShane decided to do. After interviewing money managers atbig-name firms, she chose -- at least for the time being, shesays -- to put her money into a mutual fund that invests in amix of stocks, bonds and cash investments. &quot;I don't have muchtime to devote to this,&quot; she says.   The fund she selected is Fidelity's Asset Manager, ano-load fund with a $2,500 minimum. The fund's annual expenseratio is 1.16%.   Other fund companies offer variations on the same theme.Vanguard Group's noload Star Fund, for instance, allocatesinvestors' money among seven Vanguard funds. The total annualexpenses on the package of funds are 0.44%. The minimuminvestment is $500.   Of course, investors can buy a group of individual mutualfunds. By selecting carefully from among the offerings ofseveral mutual fund companies, you can get the managementtalents of several of the better performing money managers.</TEXT></DOC>
