So far, they're right.   As the Soviet Union lurches toward its first multicandidateelections, it is clear that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reformshave brought amazing latitude in public debate to a country thatpunished unorthodox ideas with harsh prison terms just a few yearsago.   Now, even the evils of democracy are taking seed in this changinglandscape.   Political neophytes are battling entrenched Communist Partyofficials using classic tactics of election rigging: They packcaucus halls with hand-picked voters, bar electors from holdingnomination meetings by denying them a hall, or simply tosscandidates off the ballot.   Traditional authoritarianism is entangled with the new freedoms.Two weeks ago, Ukrainian activists were detained for distributingdangerous literature _ which turned out to be copies of the electionlaw.   At meetings during the campaign for the new Congress of People'sDeputies, passions run wild. Across the country, tens of thousandsof people are seizing microphones and the opportunity to speak outon everything from human rights to snow removal.   On Sunday, at least 3,000 people marched in Moscow to back BorisYeltsin, an independent candidate. One recent caucus debate ran 13hours, yet only 13 of 888 people had left by 3 a.m., said Moscowelection official Igor Orlov.   Despite the publicity over the multicandidate elections, one infour districts has only one name on the ballot. Many of theunopposed candidates are local Communist Party chiefs.   ``It's just the same as 10 years ago, in the Brezhnev era: onecandidate for each district, and each one a power in the party,''complains Andrei Deravyankin, an independent Democratic Union memberfrom the Volga River town of Saratov.   Still, new ideas are holding sway. Newspapers have exposedhundreds of cases of ``non-democratic'' behavior. Citizens haveflooded the national commission overseeing the elections with morethan 77,000 complaints. And reformers are discovering politicaltricks of their own.   ``There are dozens of violations of the letter of the law,''acknowledged election commission deputy Dmitri B. Golovko at arecent news conference. The law itself will be revised, he promised.   At this point, it seems possible that the same men who run thecountry on the 12-member Communist Party Politburo could wind upcontrolling the key legislative committees in the new parliament.   But it also seems possible the congress will be full of new facesdetermined to make the Soviet government responsive to the public.   The candidates include former political prisoners; Stalinhistorian and party outcast Roy Medvedev; reform economist OlegBogomolov, who disclosed the Soviet Union's huge deficit; EstonianPopular Front leader Marju Lauristen; environmental activists; andthe patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, according to a Westerndiplomat tracking the election.   Yeltsin, the pugnacious former Moscow Communist chief who wasdemoted in November 1987 after stepping on toes with ananti-corruption campaign, is running for the Moscow seat againstorganized party opposition.   As always, though, the Communist Party dominates. Moscow Newsfound 82 percent of the candidates are party members.   The law itself is partly to blame for the manipulation, somepeople complain.   Since a third of the deputies are being elected by certain publicorganizations, a Communist Party member who also belongs to theUnion of Writers and the Soviet Peace Committee can participate inall three of those elections and vote in his residential district aswell.   Election caucuses can legally slash the number of candidates, andthey have often rejected reformers. Nuclear physicist and humanrights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, for example, was nominated by 60research institutes, but the Soviet Academy of Sciences Presidiumrejected him in favor of a slate of old guard managers.   In many of the public organizations, there is even less choice,because leaders bar rank-and-file members from voting.   The Communist Party itself set the tone when it took 31,000 namesand boiled them down to 100 candidates _ for 100 seats.   Moreover, even if reformers manage to win a place in the2,250-seat Congress of People's Deputies in March 26 voting, theystill may not wield much power.   No official date has been announced for the body's first session.But the law calls for it to meet just one day a year _ to elect thereal, working parliament with fewer than 500 members.   A Communist Party majority in the congress could easily electonly its own members to the real positions of legislative power.</TEXT></DOC>
