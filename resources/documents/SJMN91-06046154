The major reservoirs probably will be storingjust 5 percent of the water they can hold, and most of that will be in poolstoo low to be released.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  U.S. WATER DELIVERIES CUT BY 75%RESERVOIRS MAY RUN DRY THIS YEAR  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article.See also related article on this page.Mercury News Wire Services contributed to this report.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;If 1992 is a dry year . . . the best word I can use is catastrophe,&quot; saidDon Paff, the system's chief of operations. &quot;You're talking about health andsafety . . . and water supply in buckets.&quot;;    The federal system ofreservoirs, canals and pipelines generally supplies a quarter of all surfacewater used in the state; 80 percent usually goes to farms. It does not deliverto Southern California.;    In Santa Clara County, where federal watergenerally accounts for a fourth of the supply, the cuts announced Thursdaymean residents are likely to face 30 or 35 percent mandatory rationing,compared with the 20 and 25 percent cutbacks now in force.;    Other urbanareas stung by the cutbacks include parts of the Sacramento area, Fresno,Tracy, the Contra Costa County Water District and smaller cities such asCoalinga. Their cuts range from half to three-fourths, depending on theindividual water contracts.;    California's $18 billion agriculture industryalso will lose three-fourths of its federal water.;    California Farm BureauFederation spokesman Clark Biggs said that the federal cutback, which willsiphon off 15 percent of the water available to farms statewide, &quot;is notanything surprising, but it's obviously going to stress agriculture,particularly on the west side of the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys.&quot;;   The reduction by federal officials, effective March 1, follows state actionFeb. 4 that cut off all deliveries to farmers who irrigate with the StateWater Project. While the state's announcement dealt a severe blow to KernCounty farmers, the federal action widens the effects of the drought.;   Jason Peltier, manager of Central Valley Project Water Association, whichrepresents both farm and urban users, noted that because of the prolonged dryperiod California farmers last year took about 450,000 acres out ofproduction.;    &quot;One million acres in the Central Valley will not be farmedthis summer as a result of this (combined federal) cutback and the State WaterProject cutback,&quot; Peltier said.;    It is only the third time that deliverieshave been cut by the half-century-old Central Valley Project. Last year, theywere reduced 50 percent, and in 1977, at the peak of the last drought, theywere slashed to the same levels announced Thursday.;    On March 1, stateofficials are expected to announce how much the State Water Project will cutback deliveries to urban users.;    The drought &quot;is much more of a crisis thanany of us realized,&quot; U.S. Sen. John Seymour, R-Calif., said Thursday in SanJose, at one of four news conferences held around the state to announce thefederal cuts.;    &quot;We're in deep trouble. . . . For five years we have said,'Next year it will rain.' We can no longer plan on next year it will rain.&quot;;   Paff said the cuts were based on Feb. 1 water supply forecasts, and it hasnot rained much since. &quot;It could get worse,&quot; he said.;    The bureau has theoption of cutting more or even all of the water, Paff said, &quot;but we're notforecasting zero.&quot;;    Robert Gross, chairman of the Santa Clara Valley WaterDistrict board, said the cutback means &quot;we're really going to have to tightenour straps down. My concern is the economic impact it could have on thecounty. Social impacts we can survive.&quot;;    &quot;It's scary,&quot; said Sharon Whaley,spokeswoman for the San Jose Water Co. &quot;What we're facing now is the worstyet.&quot;;    The county already is braced for severe cuts from the State WaterProject and the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct. Its reservoirs are nearly dry, and thisyear the water district will have to start extracting much more from itsunderground reserves.;    In a normal year, the bureau delivers about 7.1million acre-feet of water to its 325 contractors -- cities, special districtsand other agriculture interests, including some that have water rights becausethey were the first to tap the Sacramento River in the early part of thecentury. This year, the bureau will deliver only 2.9 million acre-feet, Paffsaid. (An acre-foot is 325,800 gallons.);    The Central Valley Project aimsto have 8 million acre-feet in storage each Sept. 30 as a hedge against a dryyear. But this year on that date it probably will have only 600,000 acre-feet-- the lowest ever, Paff said. Of that, three-fourths will be below the levelof dam outtake pipes and not usable.;    Mighty Shasta Lake, the keystone ofthe federal system, will be 97 percent empty at the end of September -- thelowest level since the early 1940s when the lake began filling behind thedam.;    The cuts mean the Santa Clara Valley Water District will receive only38,000 acre-feet of federal water through the San Felipe Pipeline system fromSan Luis Reservoir in Merced County. Its contract calls for delivery of fourtimes that, although it has never taken the full amount since the pipeline wasopened in 1987.;    A week ago, the district submitted a hardship applicationto the Bureau of Reclamation, seeking an additional 100,000 acre-feet of waterfrom the Central Valley Project. Ron Esau, the district general manager, saidhe believes that water could be provided, even with the limited supplies onhand.;    But Paff has a different view. &quot;There isn't much reserve to dealwith those hardships,&quot; he said. &quot;It's going to be painful for everyone.&quot;;    IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Santa Clara Valley Water District Board of directorshas scheduled a special meeting on the drought for 1 p.m. Thursday at districtheadquarters, 5750 Almaden Expressway, San Jose. The district staff isexpected to recommend whether to increase mandatory rationing to 30 percent orhigher.;  Drought survival plan; Here's what Gov. Pete Wilson is expected toinclude in the drought plan he will announce today.
