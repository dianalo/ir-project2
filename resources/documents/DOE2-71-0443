The most studied versionof this sensor employs thin films of evaporated Pd on silicon with athermal oxide separating the metal from the semiconductor. These devicesmake excellent detectors for molecular hydrogen and other molecules whichdissociate to form chemisorbed H on the Pd surface. There is generalagreement in the literature of these devices that they work because thereare deep adsorption sites for atomic H near the Pd-SiO/sub 2/ interface.These sites are populated by equilibrium with dissolved H in the bulkof the Pd. The Pd devices are of particular interest because they candetect molecular hydrogen at room temperature and even below, in contrastto metal oxide gas sensors which only operate at high temperature (usuallyandgt; 200 C). In this paper the authors discuss the speed of response ofPd gated MIS diodes, where the SiO/sub 2/ layer is about 20 A thick.The occupation of the adsorption sites at the Pd-SiO/sub 2/ interfacecauses a change in the effective electronic barrier height which changesthe reverse bias current through the diode. They are particularly interestedin the response around room temperature because of applications involvingunheated sensors for molecular hydrogen detection. The authors have recentlyshown that diodes of this kind have extremely fast response in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) if the Pd is Ar ion sputtered to the point that x-rayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows no contamination of the surface.They report here on the effect on the response speed of re-introducingclean diodes into the laboratory atmosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
