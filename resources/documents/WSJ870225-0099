Nearly the size of New Jersey, this county spans 7,600 square miles of sagebrush and dirt, rolling hills and snowcapped mountains. Wagon ruts of pioneers scar great expanses of desert never reached by road or touched by plow. Local cattlemen still rope and drag stock to the branding fire, scorning modern livestock chutes and holding devices. &quot;Owyhee,&quot; says one local, &quot;is the last of the old Wild West.&quot;    Maybe. Owyhee County Sheriff Timothy Nettleton, a tall, gaunt, gun-toting man wearing blue jeans, fleece vest and scuffed cowboy boots, looks as though he could swing up on a horse and ride off to face the James boys. But he doesn't sound much like frontier justice as he hunches over a telephone and sets a trap for the most notorious outlaw in the West, Claude Dallas. &quot;If I take the right door off my plane, we can put two men in it with AR-15 rifles. I can hold a 60-degree bank around the house and cover anybody who comes out.&quot;    For most of the 8,000 residents of Owyhee County (pronounced oh-WHY-hee), 47-year-old Sheriff Nettleton and his six deputies are the only law they know. But while country life styles often seem little changed from past generations, crime and the pursuit of criminals for many county sheriffs these days take on modern hues of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; -- with allowances for rural customs.    Sheriff Nettleton, whose annual salary is $20,000, spent a recent day digging through the dirt of a chicken coop and came up with a packet of heroin worth $12,000. &quot;We have the same criminal problems everybody else has,&quot; he says. &quot;That ranges from drugs to sexual abuse of children.&quot;    And crime here, as elsewhere, tends to involve young people in disproportionate numbers, although rural crimes generally are less serious than urban ones. &quot;The old pros, like the safe peelers, have mostly been stashed away,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, it's apt to be a kid who took a lawn mower somebody left out. A lot of this stuff shows up in yard sales.&quot; He adds: &quot;There ought to be a crime for stupidity. It would cover most of the trouble kids get into these days.&quot;    While Owyhee crime has changed, so have the methods of the county sheriff. Modern patrol-car radios permit contact throughout most of the county. Eight paramedic units have assumed from the sheriff the heavy burden of handling badly injured people at the scene of accidents and shootings. Most residents now have telephones.    But other things haven't changed much, despite the new technology. Cattle rustling, mostly the theft of unbranded calves, is an age-old problem here in Owyhee County. Proving ownership of a disputed calf is nearly impossible -- only cow and her calf know for sure. &quot;Mothering,&quot; the subtle tilt of the head and drop of the ears that the cow and her calf display in recognizing each other, has been witnessed and sworn to in some cases. But courts vary in their receptiveness to such testimony.    In two recent cases, Sheriff Nettleton put calves of questioned ownership in a corral with several cows and recorded the &quot;mothering&quot; on videotape as the natural parents and offspring found one another. &quot;The video evidence was so overwhelming, we were able to get guilty pleas,&quot; he says.    Sheriff Nettleton seems comfortable with the changes in law enforcement. And his own lack of formal police training obviously doesn't cow him. &quot;It takes five years to make a good cop,&quot; he says of his deputies, &quot;unless he went to college -- and then it takes 10.&quot;    His easy relationship with this rough land and its old ranching families comes naturally. His parents, ranchers, settled in Owyhee County in 1863, after Indians ran them out of Nevada. He became a rancher himself but later got out. &quot;I went broke before it became popular,&quot; he remarks.    He ran for sheriff in 1970, partly on the suggestion of a judge and partly because the sheriff at the time irritated him. He won his first election by two votes (eight on recount). &quot;A real vote of confidence,&quot; chuckles his wife, Charlene.    But he has scored wide victories in four elections since then, even as a Democrat in a Republican county. He is less liked, some local people say, by residents of the more populous areas, who contend that he favors ranchers. And a few of his constituents find his take-charge style of law &quot;domineering.&quot;    Regarded as a cool head, he has never fired (&quot;put the hammer down,&quot; as he terms it) on anybody in his 16 years as sheriff. But over a second glass of whiskey at his home one evening, he admits he has twice found himself looking into the muzzle of a gun and talked his way out of danger.    In a county in which posses on horseback still sometimes pursue fugitives, Sheriff Nettleton does much of his work from an airplane. (He once &quot;flew down&quot; a drunk driver, landing in the road to arrest him.) He and two friends bought a Cessna 182, which as sheriff he uses on a cost-sharing basis. A county town 220 miles and five hours away by road from Murphy, the county seat, can be reached in 45 minutes by plane.    But his usual job of policing accidents, finding dope, issuing driver's licenses and running the jail took a dramatic turn six years ago when he found himself leading a manhunt for a fugitive who was to become a modern legend in the rural West, Claude Dallas. In a remote valley of Owyhee one winter day in 1981, two armed game wardens walked into the camp of a 30-year-old trapper, who already had a reputation as a rugged mountain man. When they tried to arrest him for killing bobcats, he killed both of them, then disappeared into the wilds.    For 16 months, &quot;Tim lived that case 24 hours a day,&quot; says one lawman. &quot;It became a personal quest.&quot; And, the sheriff concedes, &quot;Claude took some days off my life.&quot; In April 1982, the sheriff, an FBI SWAT team and a handful of other police captured the trapper in rural Nevada after a gun battle in which the outlaw was shot in the ankle. Tried and convicted of manslaughter, he served just three years before he escaped last March from an Idaho prison -- and the manhunt was on again.    In theory, the hunt shifted to Ada County, Idaho, where the prison break took place. But the sheriff's manhunt goes on.    The Owyhee Desert, named for trappers from Hawaii who disappeared there, takes in Owyhee County and a swath of Nevada and Oregon. And the Idaho sheriff admits his aerial search might sometimes take him out of state. &quot;I'm not a surveyor -- I don't know where the line is,&quot; he remarks.    Local lawmen agree the fugitive probably is back in his old Owyhee Desert hunting grounds, where he was caught the first time. Publicity -- including two books and a movie on the case -- probably has forced the trapper back into the desert, because that's the only place people won't turn him in, says Wayne Cornell, the city editor of the Idaho Press-Tribune. Game wardens aren't widely admired here, and it is generally understood that many people wouldn't divulge to authorities the fugitive's whereabouts.    The sheriff confirms that he is trying to keep the case alive. One day, the fugitive trapper is again on his mind as he maneuvers his small plane to catch updrafts that will take him over the 8,000-foot snowcap of War Eagle Mountain and then glides downward into a sunny valley to dip over a band of wild horses. &quot;I wouldn't cooperate on your article except for one thing,&quot; he says. &quot;Every time there's a story, I get a few calls. One of these days, a call is going to lead me to Claude Dallas.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
