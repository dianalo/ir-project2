Traders said the issue, which was priced yesterday to yield from 4% in 1988 to 7 1/2% on zero coupon bonds due 2003 and 2004, yielded almost 20 basis points, or two-tenths of a percentage point, more than predicted.    &quot;It was very difficult to price this issue, and (the interest rate) came slightly higher than people were expecting,&quot; Richard Tilghman, a vice president, public finance, at First Boston Corp., said. The issue's co-managers were First Boston, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    The Puerto Rico bonds had been aggressively marketed because of credit concerns and fears that the issue was simply too large to sell efficiently.    But, according to Jeffrey Noss, senior municipal analyst at Roosevelt andamp; Cross Inc., the fact that the bonds &quot;came cheap to the market&quot; outweighed possible concerns about high unemployment and a lack of &quot;socio-economic vibrancy&quot; in Puerto Rico. Overall, he said, the self-governing U.S. commonwealth &quot;has a reasonably well-balanced economy, and the trend has been up.&quot;    Several subsidiaries of large U.S. companies that operate in Puerto Rico were reported to be active buyers of the debt. Under Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, the companies operate tax-advantaged industries in Puerto Rico and in turn invest in Puerto Rican securities.    The bond issue consisted of almost $1.42 billion of public improvement refunding bonds and $206 million of public improvement bonds. Serial bonds due 1992, 1995 and 1996 carried a letter of credit from Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd., and term bonds due 2006 were insured.    The serial bonds backed by a letter of credit were rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. The insured 2006 term bonds were rated triple-A by both Moody's and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. The remaining bonds were rated Baa-1 by Moody's and single-A by Sandamp;P.    The Puerto Rico issue was the largest ever sold in book-entry form. Municipal bonds sold in that form don't provide a certificate of ownership to each investor; instead, records of ownership are kept on computer files. </TEXT></DOC>
