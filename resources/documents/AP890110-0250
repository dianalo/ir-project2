On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,settled 17 cents higher at $17.72 a barrel Monday. On Friday, thecontract closed up 13 cents at $17.55 following a volatile week.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, domestic heatingoil futures ended Monday higher. The February contract settled at54.15 cents a gallon, up 0.55 cent.   Meanwhile, unleaded gasoline futures closed mixed, with theFebruary contract up 0.24 cent at 47.96 cents a gallon.   Energy analysts said bullish sentiment about OPEC's agreement tocut production continued to push prices higher. The 13-memberOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries announced in Novemberit would reduce its output to 18.5 million barrels a day startingJan. 1 from an amount estimated at more than 22 million barrels.   Since then, prices have risen approximately $5 a barrel.   Traders said futures prices got a lift Monday from reports thatmost OPEC countries are abiding by the accord and have drasticallyreduced their production. At least two reports suggested that SaudiArabia, the cartel's largest producer, cut its output by more than 2million barrels a day the first week in January.   ``Whichever (report) you take, the figures show they're down.It's the direction that helped out,'' said Bob Baker, a futuresanalyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.   Prices also got a lift from reports of continuing problems in theNorth Sea following a fire in an oil facility there late last year,traders said.   ``Prices are moving up because it's a bull market and there is nobearish news,'' said Jim Fiedler, an oil broker with E.D.andamp;F.
