Typical data of the forced-flow cooled suprconductor used forthe computation are given. To estimate the safety of the coil and phenomenonof quench in detail, equations of unsteady compression flow and unsteadythermal conduction were solved using difference method. As the result,it was found that an accurate prediction is possible of such magnitudesas stability limit disturbance energy, maximum helium pressure at thetime of quench, and the maximum conductor temperature which are necessaryfor the planning of coils. Stabilities of disturbance energy, disturbancetime, initial flow amount, etc. and their effects on quench were studied,and found that the disturbance time and initial flow amount had comparativelylittle effect.
