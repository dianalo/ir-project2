<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-16-0365 </DOCNO><TEXT>A theoretical foundation was developed for modeling, analyzing, and testinga system for voltage collapse. Real power-reactive power (PQ) and realpower-voltage (PV) controlability of the transient stability model isdefined at any time step along the transient trajectory or at an equilibriumpoint. Tests for PQ and PV controlability were developed and {und string}proven to encompass every known test for voltage stability based on:(a) multiple loadflow/transient stability methods (that assess whethermultiple solutions exist, whether the simulation will converge, and thespeed of convergence of Newton Raphson based solution mehtods; (b) linearizeddynamic mehtods that establish tests that insure tap changer, switchableshunt capacitor, static var compensator, and excitation voltage controlsare stable; (c) nonlinear dynamic method tests that attempt to establisha region of stability where the transient stability model is voltagestable; and (d) loadflow sensitivity methods that attempt to establishsensitivity matrix. A method for determining the buses, which are vulnerableto voltage collapse for a contingency, was developed that does not requirea loadflow or transient stability simulation of the contingency. Thecontrolability and strong controlability tests are applied to a 30 busNew England system model. The results confirm the theory and show thatthe controlability tests that include real power/voltage and reactivepower/phase coupling are more accurated and sensitive than decoupledmodel controlability tests when the system approaches voltage collapse.60 refs., 107 tabs., 14 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
