But Mr. Nuttle, director and chief strategist for the Robertson campaign, argues that, once again, the evolving conventional wisdom is wrong.    &quot;No one in the millions of homes he reached are going to blame Pat Robertson for this,&quot; says Mr. Nuttle. &quot;This group of people wants someone in the television evangelism industry to survive -- and they want some of these principles to be adhered to in government.&quot;    Already the outlines of a counter-offensive are taking shape in his mind.    Robertson campaign officials argue that earlier disclosures about Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker, who had much closer ties to the Robertson ministry, didn't prevent the Robertson campaign from stunning the political world by finishing second, ahead of Vice President George Bush, in the Iowa Republican caucuses. They argue that attempts to link the two -- Mr. Swaggart, a sometime rival, endorsed Mr. Robertson in 1986 -- is guilt by association. &quot;We've got to be careful not to let rumors and postulates take command,&quot; Mr. Nuttle says.    Marc Nuttle, who at age 38 has transformed the Robertson effort from a nuisance campaign into a formidable force in the Republican Party, has emerged in the past year as one of the most innovative strategists and theorists in politics.    &quot;Nuttle has seen the openings in the process and has done a sterling job of capitalizing on them,&quot; says James Guth, a Furman University specialist on the Christian Right. &quot;It's a real advance on the kind of organizing the Christian Right and the Moral Majority did earlier in the 1980s with the same size base.&quot;    From the start, the Nuttle strategy has been to get maximum political impact out of a core of supporters who are making a virtue out of being political newcomers.    In Iowa, the Robertson organization worked for a year to mobilize evangelicals and others into an infantry that swelled on caucus night and overwhelmed regular Republicans in many places around the state. In Nevada, Mr. Nuttle instructed Robertson supporters to attend last Friday's caucuses as undecideds because he &quot;didn't want to show our hands so the other forces could galvanize against us.&quot; In Georgia, he calculated that the Robertson forces could take over the state's convention delegation simply by controlling the largest county caucus in each of the state's congressional districts this month.    &quot;By understanding where you can pressure the political system,&quot; says Sammy Raffield, Mr. Robertson's coordinator in Middle Georgia's Bibb County, &quot;we used people who knew nothing about politics to take over the county convention.&quot;    And now, with the Super Tuesday round of primaries and caucuses only two weeks away, Mr. Nuttle's forces are on their home turf in the South. They are, moreover, working the black inner-city districts of the South that his rivals are all but ignoring because there isn't any GOP establishment there.    &quot;A candidacy like his, with a hard-core unshakable base, becomes formidable because he knows just which districts to go into,&quot; says Eddie Mahe, a Washington-based Republican strategist who is one of Mr. Nuttle's mentors.    Mr. Nuttle worked his way into politics through the world of Oklahoma Republicans, working for Sen. Dewey Bartlett and Gov. Henry Bellmon, before coming into the circle around Paul Weyrich, the New Right leader who directs the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation. He did pioneering work in the creation of legal entities to use tax-deductible corporate contributions to fund political-education and grass-roots lobbying efforts. Before long, according to Richard Shelby, a former Oklahoma GOP state chairman with ties to the Bush campaign, he emerged as &quot;one of the premier federal election financing lawyers in the Republican Party.&quot;    But the strong card of Mr. Nuttle, who considers himself a &quot;strong Christian,&quot; was his ability to see the potential that evangelical voters and other conservatives had to reshape the Republican Party. &quot;I was tired of going out and running statewide races and running 5% or 10% short,&quot; says Mr. Nuttle, who commutes from his home in Norman, Okla., to Robertson headquarters in Chesapeake, Va. &quot;I was looking for a new voting group and a new series of issues to get people involved.&quot;    The 5% solution was to bring evangelical Christians into politics. &quot;These people don't care what the conventional wisdom is, they don't care what the politicians say, they don't care what the press says,&quot; argues Mr. Nuttle. &quot;They vote their hearts and their consciences.&quot;    But Mr. Nuttle knew that a group that could provide the slender margin of victory that helped elect conservatives like Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Jeremiah Denton of Alabama -- both Nuttle clients -- to the Senate in 1980 couldn't sustain a presidential campaign on its own. So Mr. Nuttle, who says he wasn't drawn to Mr. Robertson for religious reasons, sought to broaden the campaign's base with recruits from groups as divergent as right-to-life organizations, balanced-budget lobbies and even Mothers Against Drunk Drivers.    Sen. Nickles, one of Mr. Nuttle's classmates at Ponca City High School in Oklahoma, remembers him as &quot;aggressive, hardworking, a scrappy wrestler and good card player.&quot; It's an assessment that many of Mr. Nuttle's campaign rivals -- who have discovered that the Robertson campaign doesn't hesitate to play hardball -- would share.    But today, the Robertson campaign faces the challenge of blunting the bad publicity from the Swaggart affair; CBS News, for example, has speculated that the Swaggart imbroglio could have &quot;a direct effect on Robertson's campaign.&quot; The two men have little direct relationship. Mr. Swaggart's constituency is far more blue-collar than Mr. Robertson's. Mr. Swaggart portrays God as far more harsh and judgmental than does Mr. Robertson, who tends to argue that God wants to help people if only they'll let him.    &quot;Yet another crisis creates the impression that these ministers are all tainted,&quot; says Jeffrey Hadden, a University of Virginia sociologist specializing in evangelical politics. &quot;Some people leaning toward Pat are going to have second thoughts.&quot;    Mr. Nuttle says he isn't worried. He's already scheduled a senior staff meeting for Nov. 9. That's the morning after Election Day. </TEXT></DOC>
