The moves were the government's latest attempt to deal with someof the complaints that fueled the pro-democracy movement.   The government also promised leniency toward Chinese students whoheld protests in the United States to condemn the crackdown on themovement.   Also today, the State Tourism Bureau ordered major hotels inBeijing that receive Cable News Network and the American ForcesRadio and Television Service to shut down reception of thebroadcasts, hotel officials said.   Tourism officials were not immediately available for comment, andthe city Foreign Affairs Office said it did not know of any suchorder.   In another development, Chinese soldiers confiscated film fromJapanese tourists affiliated with the Japan Socialist Party afterthey took pictures from buses of Tiananmen Square, an actionforbidden under martial law.   The soldiers boarded three of the four buses and asked people whotook pictures of the square to hand over their film, said HideoTarumi of the Japanese Embassy's consular section. Less than 10people complied, said Tarumi, who added that the embassy consideredthe incident over and ``not a big deal.''   Official Chinese media today reported arrests, confessions andtrials of officials who defrauded their work units and took bribes.   The stories drove home the theme that the ruling Communist Partyis involved in a major effort to root out corruption.   Rampant official corruption has been a focus of popular anger.Calls to eliminate it were common among pro-democracy protesterswhose seven-week movement was crushed June 4 when troops drove themfrom Tiananmen Square.   Chinese media said nearly 100 soldiers and police died in thecrackdown and that thousands were injured, while about 100 civiliansdied and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese witnesses and Westernintelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as3,000.   A wave of arrests of pro-democracy activists followed thecrackdown, along with the suppression of the free exchange of ideas.   The corruption cases reported today included what the CommunistParty newspaper People's Daily called the biggest fraud case in theChinese capital since the founding of communist China 40 years ago.   The paper announced the trial of six people charged withdefrauding the Chinese Academy of Sciences Microelectronics Centerout of $105,000. The paper did not indicate when the trial began orwhether a verdict was reached.   Communist Party chiefs in Henan province and the Inner MongoliaAutonomous Region announced anti-corruption steps Monday ``as partof an effort to respond to the central government's call onconstruction of an honest and clean government organ to win thetrust of the people,'' a Xinhua report said.   In Henan, government-run companies will be screened by the end ofAugust and anyone engaging in profiteering or blackmail will besternly punished, Xinhua said. Inner Mongolian officials who havetaken advantage of their positions were urged to turn themselves inand return ill-gotten money and goods, the report said.   At a trial in Shanghai, seven people, including four CommunistParty members, were charged with cheating the city government'sTextile Industry Bureau out of $35,000, the Legal Daily said.   Led by Liu Zhen, deputy director of the bureau, they chargedinflated prices for equipment, concocted bogus expenses and dodgedtaxes, the paper said. It did not give any results of the trial,which began June 20.   Officials in Wuhan, Hubei province, reported that 13 people haveturned themselves in since Jan. 1, including the party secretary ofa marine transportation enterprise who confessed in May to acceptingbribes of $3,500, the Worker's Daily said.   Wuhan prosecution authorities ``are using various channels topromote awareness of laws and consequences of corruption, includingrewarding informers and protecting them from revenge,'' the papersaid.   Officials in Chengdu, Sichuan province, also reportedachievements in cracking down on corruption in the first half ofthis year, the Worker's Daily said without elaborating.   The government, meanwhile, said it would not investigate Chinesestudents in the United States who participated in anti-Beijingrallies ``without knowing the truth.''   A statement issued by the Chinese Embassy in Washington saidBeijing ``would take a lenient approach toward Chinese students who,without knowing the truth, participated in the demonstrations ...and that it will not look into their cases at all,'' the officialXinhua News Agency.</TEXT></DOC>
