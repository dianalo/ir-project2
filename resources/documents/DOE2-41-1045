Since the earlydays of computer applications, this has been achieved by undertakingin-house projects and supporting industrial and academic efforts in processsimulation. As computer technology evolved towards microcomputers, thetransfer of software has become a key element of the global technologytransfer from CANMET to industry. The early 80's have seen CANMET becomethe chief supplier of software for the evaluation and optimization ofmineral processes as a result of the SPOC project (Simulated Processingof Ore and Coal). The commercial diffusion of Artificial Intelligenceproducts, especially of expert system shells has opened a vast domainof computer applications for process diagnosis, operator training andprocess control. This new computer technology has been incorporated inthe Randamp;D projects supported by CANMET and the impact of these early effortsis already being felt in the industry. The paper reviews CAMNET's contributionsto computer applications in the mineral industry, outlines the variousmechanisms by which technology transfer can be achieved and providesinformation on how to benefit from existing and up-coming projects. 16refs., 3 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
