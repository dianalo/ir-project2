If Allegis follows through on its recently announced plan to pay a $60-a-share distribution to stockholders, Boeing would benefit -- to the tune of between $109.2 million and $244.5 million -- because of an unusual aircraft financing pact that gave it $700 million of Allegis notes structured with certain anti-takeover features.    The notes also are convertible into a 16% stake in the Chicago-based travel concern, whose shares soared in value after the proposed distribution was announced.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Allegis stock closed at $86.50, down $1.    Officials familiar with the Boeing/Allegis pact, signed May 13, estimated the aircraft maker's potential gain depending on the notes' conversion price.    Seattle-based Boeing declined to comment on the financial implications of its agreement with Allegis.    Although the Boeing windfall could be affected by other developments, analysts include it among a number of question marks that have been raised about the broader rationale behind Allegis's proposed distribution, which is intended as an anti-takeover move.    In announcing the distribution, for instance, Allegis said it had been considering the move for two months. Analysts wonder why, then, the company ever bothered with the Boeing pact, which now could prove to be extremely expensive for Allegis -- especially since the pact only served as the company's main takeover defense for a period of about two weeks. &quot;It's looking like a very pricey backup plan,&quot; said one aircraft analyst.    Associates of Richard Ferris, Allegis's chairman, admitted the Boeing transaction could look awkward for Allegis in light of its distribution plan.    At the time Allegis signed the pact with Boeing, the transaction &quot;was a sensible one,&quot; said one associate. But he said when Coniston Partners last week announced both the ownership of a 13% stake in Allegis and a plan to gain control of the travel company's board, &quot;the situation was markedly different and now the recapitalization more makes sense.&quot;    Nevertheless, a variety of analysts and airline industry officials also expressed strong reservations about the $3 billion of debt Allegis plans to take on to finance the distribution to shareholders. Both major debt rating agencies -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. -- immediately began reviewing the Allegis recapitalization to determine if the company's debt ratings should be lowered with its total borrowings expected to reach $5.2 billion.    Analysts said the estimated carrying costs of the added $3 billion of debt -- between $270 million and $330 million annually -- would probably wipe out the company's projected 1987 earnings, which they had forecast at about $150 million.    Moreover, they predicted Allegis would find itself under severe pressure to take major cost-cutting steps at its United Airlines unit, which already is straining to make a profit in the highly competitive airline industry.    Some also question whether a heavy debt load would get United into trouble if the airline industry is hurt by a recession.    &quot;You like to leave yourself some borrowing capacity when you operate in an industry that's cyclical,&quot; said John V. Pincavage, an airline analyst at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;What they've done is eliminate that cushion.&quot;    Airline industry executives also questioned the wisdom of taking on so much debt.    The move &quot;is absolutely impossible to rationalize,&quot; said a financial officer at a major carrier. He said United could find itself in a bad position in any kind of a downturn or major fare war. In addition, United also has its own ambitious plans to replace outmoded jets and expand its fleet.    Allegis's total projected capital spending requirements for 1987 are projected at $1.9 billion.    Partly for some of those same reasons, Allegis itself said a heavy debt load would be unwise when it rejected a bid by its pilots union to buy United.    Yet Allegis has also said its moves are a response to shareholders' concerns that the stock has been under-performing based on the company's assets.    When the distribution plan was first announced, Allegis said it felt it was &quot;necessary to provide shareholders with a substantial increase in the near-term value of their investment,&quot; while it continues to pursue a strategy of making the concern a full-service, integrated travel company.    Its actions, in effect, have coincided in part at least with outside pressure from the pilots and Coniston.    Philip Baggaley, assistant vice president of Standard andamp; Poor's, predicted Allegis will have to cut back on capital spending, lease a greater percentage of its planes, sell hotel properties and demand wage concessions from employees to pay for the debt.    Such moves could further infuriate United pilots, who are still pursuing a hostile takeover of the airline, and its machinists, who have been in contract mediation and had been pushing for an ownership interest in Allegis.    There's some chance the costly Boeing agreement may not end up being part of the debt burden, however. Some officials close to Allegis held out the possibility that, as one of Boeing's biggest customers, Allegis may be able to somehow renegotiate the notes.    As previously reported, Boeing is entitled to convert the notes into Allegis common at any time. The conversion price set by the pact is a minimum of $65.125 and a maximum of $76.125.    After the $60-a-share distribution is completed, investment bankers say, the remaining Allegis stub is expected to trade at about $28 a share.    That would indicate that at the maximum conversion price, Boeing would receive 9.2 million common shares. The distribution on those shares would amount to $552 million, and the remaining stubs would be valued at about $257.6 million, for a total of $809.6 million. At the very least, Boeing would get a windfall profit of $109.2 million on the stake.    Assuming the minimum conversion price, Boeing would get 10.7 million shares. The distribution on those shares would be $644.9 million, while the remaining stubs would be valued at $299.6 million, for a total of $944.5 million. That would give Boeing a quick profit of $244.5 million on its note.    Even if Boeing chooses not to exchange its note for common stock immediately, there is a provision in the pact with Allegis that gives Boeing the right to receive the distribution whenever it wishes to convert on the terms that have already been offered. </TEXT></DOC>
