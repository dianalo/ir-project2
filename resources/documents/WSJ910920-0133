In July, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled thata seaweed derivative made in the Philippines is suitable forhuman consumption. The decision brightens prospects for anestimated 350,000 Filipinos who depend on seaweed farming,and it rewards the efforts of processors who have beenbattling in the U.S. and Europe since the mid-1980s forregulatory approval of the powdered derivative, Philippinenatural-grade carrageenan.</LP><TEXT>   At stake, according to Philippine processors, is $500million in annual global sales of carrageenan that isexpected to double several times in the next few years.   An emulsifier, gelling agent and stabilizer that is mixedinto thousands of products ranging from paint and pet food totoothpaste and ice cream, carrageenan currently accounts forabout 27% of the $2 billion annual global market for naturalgums. But the lower price of the Philippine product and newcarrageenan applications, including a fake fat used in meatproducts such as McDonald's Corp.'s lower-fat hamburger, areexpected to sharply boost demand.   The Philippines grows about 75% of the seaweed usedworld-wide to produce carrageenan. Yet Philippine efforts toexport carrageenan have been hampered in the U.S. since 1986,when the National Academy of Sciences issued guidelines thatdisqualified the Philippine product as a food additive.   U.S. manufacturers, who supported the restrictiveguidelines, said the Philippine product contains carrageenanbut is too crude to qualify as carrageenan itself. Althoughthey stopped short of alleging that the Philippine product isunfit for human consumption, they argued that it is impureand possibly unsanitary because it is less-refined than thecarrageenan extract produced in the U.S. and Europe.   A few small and medium-sized Philippine companieschallenged that view and two of its leading proponents, FMCCorp. and Hercules Inc., diversified U.S. companies withsubstantial food-additive divisions. The Philippine concernsgot support from their own government and the U.S. StateDepartment, which American officials say helped present thePhilippine position in Washington.   &quot;We can't expect anything to come to us as a free lunch,&quot;says Emmanuel Pelaez, the Philippine ambassador toWashington, who lobbied on behalf of the Philippine product.&quot;The U.S. is the biggest mass market in the world. We have tocompete.&quot;   Philippine processors thought they had won when, in July1990, the FDA ruled that the Philippine product iscarrageenan and meets food-additive standards. But the fightentered another round as U.S. carrageenan processors lobbiedlegislators.   Congress instructed the FDA to re-examine the case. But onJuly 8, the FDA reaffirmed its ruling in favor of thePhilippine product. The decision was celebrated asvindication of Philippine processors, particularly BensonDakay, president of Shemberg Marketing Corp., which exportedabout 650 million pesos ($24.3 million) of seaweed productslast year, nearly half of the Philippines' production.   Mr. Dakay, who also is president of the Seaweed IndustryAssociation of the Philippines, has led efforts to winforeign acceptance of natural-grade carrageenan. His companyand the association are both headquartered in Cebu, thecenter of the country's seaweed-processing industry.   The main difference between refined carrageenan and thePhilippine product, Mr. Dakay says, is that the former isproduced by a capital-intensive extracting process, whilenatural-grade carrageenan is produced by alkali cooking,drying and grinding.   Dissolved in water, the refined product makes a clearsolution; the natural-grade product forms a murky solution.For most applications, however, particularly the new fakefat, murky solutions are no problem, according to Philippineprocessors. Refined carrageenan costs $12 to $25 perkilogram, compared with only $3 to $8 per kilogram for thenatural-grade product.   Mr. Dakay says that the sharply lower price, combined withsuperior gelling properties of the natural-grade product,will create new markets for carrageenan, increasing demandfor dry seaweed and generating additional employment.   U.S. processors say the Philippine product, which theyrefer to as &quot;seaweed flour,&quot; will confuse buyers withoutsubstantially increasing the market for carrageenan.   &quot;The material is being offered as a substitute for variousof our products,&quot; says Willis Rohling, president of MarineColloids Phillipine Inc., an FMC subsidiary that exportsabout 20% of the Philippines' seaweed production forprocessing overseas. &quot;We think that they are probably tryingto take a free ride on the development work that has takenplace over the last 20 years.&quot;   Mr. Rohling says FMC pioneered seaweed cultivation in thePhilippines in the early 1960s and is being unfairlyportrayed by emerging local competitors as an interloper. &quot;Ifthere is a seaweed industry here today, it is because of us,&quot;he says.</TEXT></DOC>
