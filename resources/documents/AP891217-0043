But we also want someonewho is hardworking and aggressive, a manager who knows how to getus a new printing press,'' said Michal Horacek, a reporter on themass circulation weekly Mlady Svet and a member of the oppositiongroup Civic Forum.   Among the first acts of the new opposition-approved governmentsworn in Dec. 10 was the firing of the official state censor. LastMonday, reporters at Mlady Svet, who were required by unwrittenrule to be party members, celebrated the new government bydestroying their membership cards.   Even the Communist Party dailies Rude Pravo and Pravda now carrynews. Instead of Pablum and propaganda, each day's pages offerreports on formerly taboo subjects like the secret police andcorruption in the highest party circles.   It's a big change from only a month ago when editors made weeklyvisits to the Communist Party press office to hear about theprevious week's ``errors'' and receive ``advice'' that was passedalong to the staff.   Offensive passages were deleted, offensive publicationsconfiscated before they hit the street and some journalists whooperated too far from the party line, like those editingunderground journals, wound up behind bars.   ``The people of this country were trained to read between thelines,'' said Horacek, whose column ``Letters of Love and Hate''was addressed to dead heroes but with a political message that wasclear to Czechoslovak cognoscente.   When information was strictly controlled, every text had asub-text, every word a hidden meaning. People knew better than tobelieve what they read and literature became a refuge from reality.   In this way, the traditionally important role of writers andother intellectuals in Eastern Europe was enhanced. Culturalvariety substituted for political plurality, and the censor and thewritten word both carried enormous weight in the battle forreaders' minds.   Now, the rules of this Kafkaesque game have changed.   ``What was only suggested before can now be said, and this meanswe have to be more accurate, more tolerant and we have to learn tocompete in the marketplace,'' said Lubos Beniaka, Horacek'scolleague, who wrote 121 pages for his newspaper on thepro-democracy demonstrations that began Nov. 17 and will end infree elections next year.   ``We are quite in the dark about what we are going to be,'' hesaid.   Whatever it is, newspaper staffs will have to decide quicklysince state subsidies in a democratic system will disappear.   Reporters throughout Prague, exhausted by the non-stop coverageof fast-breaking events but exhilarated by new opportunities, arespending much time in meetings discussing their fate.   ``We can be bought by Robert Maxwell or Rupert Murdoch now,''Horacek said. ``Anything can happen. But, above all, we want to beindependent. And now we are asking, would we be independent in Mr.Murdoch's world?''</TEXT></DOC>
