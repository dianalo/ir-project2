When the comment period ends, the FAA will use the commentssubmitted, together with other available information, to review the regulation.After the review, if the FAA finds that changes are appropriate, it willinitiate rulemaking proceedings to amend the regulation. Comments thatprovide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presentedare particularly helpful in evaluating the effects of the rule and determiningwhether additional rulemaking is needed. Comments are specifically invitedon the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energyaspects of the rule that might suggest the need to modify the rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule</ITAG>The purpose of this amendment to andSection; 71.171 of Part 71 of the FederalAviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) is to correct the description ofthe Titusville, Florida, Control Zone. The existing description makes referenceto Cape Kennedy restricted area R-2926. The correct reference is Cape Canaveralrestricted area R-2934. Section 71.171 of Part 71 of the Federal AviationRegulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.6E dated January 3, 1989.Under the circumstances presented, the FAA concludes that there is an immediateneed for a regulation to make this minor and nonsubstantive change. Noincrease in controlled airspace will result from this rule. Therefore,I find that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are unnecessaryand contrary to the public interest.The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71</ITAG>Aviation safety, Control zone.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, Part 71 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) is amended, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS</ITAG>1.
