The ``urgent'' requests, which the Bush administration refusedlate Thursday, were made by Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos throughmilitary and intelligence channels, The Washington Post reported,citing a variety of unnamed administration sources.   The Los Angeles Times, also citing an anonymous source, reportedthat the Philippine government asked that American planes bombrebel-held air bases, fuel dumps and a seaborne freighter.   The U.S. Embassy in Manilla received telephone calls from Mrs.Aquino, Ramos and another senior defense official, the Times said.   The requests were numerous and confused, making it difficult forGen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, tosort them out, according to the Post.   The request for U.S. planes to bomb some positions was turneddown because Americans may have been on bases commandeered by therebels and out of concern for the political impact of direct U.S.intervention, the Post said.   U.S. F-4 fighter-bombers flew cover for government troops onFriday and early Saturday morning but were idle on Sunday and neverfired a shot at ground targets, U.S. officials said.   According to earlier administration accounts, the jets were notdeployed until Mrs. Aquino made a formal request through U.S.Ambassador Nicholas Platt.   The Times said Aquino ``wanted the fuel dumps and an armouredcolumn'' to come under U.S. attack. Ramos called for attacks on theair bases to disable rebel-controlled aircraft on the ground. ThePhilippine military official, who was not identified, wanted theU.S. to attack the freighter believed to be carrying munitions orreinforcements for the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
