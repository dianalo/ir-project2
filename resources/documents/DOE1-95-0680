<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0680 </DOCNO><TEXT>PRESTO-II (Prediction of Radiation Effects from Shallow Trench Operations)is a computer code designed to evaluate possible doses and risks fromshallow-land burial sites. The model is intended to serve as a non-site-specificscreening model for assessing radionuclide transport, ensuing exposure,and health impacts to a static local population for a 1000-year periodfollowing the end of disposal operations. Human exposure scenarios includenormal releases human intrusion, and limited site farming or reclamation.Pathways and processes of transport from the trench to an individualor population include ground-water transport, overland flow, erosion,surface water dilution, suspension, atmospheric transport and deposition,inhalation, external exposure, and ingestion of contaminated beef, milk,crops, and water. The proposed waste disposal area in Koteyli, Balikesir,Turkey, has been evaluated using the PRESTO-II methodology. The resultshave been compared to those obtained for the Barnwell, South Carolina,site. Dose estimates for both sites are below regulatory limits, forthe release and exposure scenarios considered. The doses for the sitesare comparable, with slightly higher estimates obtained from the Turkishsite.</TEXT></DOC>
