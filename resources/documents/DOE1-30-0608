<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-30-0608 </DOCNO><TEXT>A brief description of the Geel linear accelerator (GELINA) and its maincharacteristics are presented. Representative examplex for two typesof measurements are discussed. High resolution neutron resonance spectroscopyaims at the investigation of nuclear structure at excitation energiesabove neutron emission threshold. In nuclei with not too high a leveldensity, states at these energies are still expected to be sufficientlysimple for an interpretation in terms of nuclear models, and the distributionof neutron and radiative strengths is expected to serve as a signaturefor their structure. The study of neutron induced fission helps to investigatethe structure of the fission barrier and the properties of nuclear statesat very large deformation. 26 refs.; 14 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
