Discarding his jacket and lighting a cigar, he waded into an hour's verbal fencing with a visiting banker. The subject: an offer to take Mobil's disappointing Container Corp. subsidiary off the oil giant's hands.    Once satisfied with the numbers, Mr. Murray set a deadline for a contract and ended the meeting. &quot;He said he didn't want to make a career&quot; out of the sale of the subsidiary, recalls the banker, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.'s managing director, Donald Brennan. &quot;He wanted it settled one way or the other by July 25.&quot;    Since Mr. Murray became chairman last February, he has projected an image of rapid-fire decision making. With the oil industry reeling under falling prices, he has shed an estimated $1.5 billion to $2 billion in Mobil assets, applying most of the proceeds to reduce the company's debt. He quietly lopped more than 10,000 jobs from Mobil's world-wide work force last year, nearly equaling on a percentage basis the highly publicized cuts at Exxon Corp. He has raised the company's profile on Wall Street and begun a drive to bring Mobil's headquarters closer to line operations.    More than Mobil's balance sheet is at stake in this display of decisiveness. Although he holds more titles and wields more power on the organization chart than any other Mobil chief executive in 30 years, Mr. Murray is working his way out of the shadow of two strong predecessors. Former Chairman Rawleigh Warner and former President William Tavoulareas still maintain offices at Mobil.    If Mr. Murray's moves, including some dismantling of his predecessors' work, have angered Messrs. Warner and Tavoulareas, they aren't saying. But some Mobil executives doubt that Mr. Murray much cares. Since taking over, he has secured his position by replacing most of the former management team with his own players, informally dubbed &quot;the Murray Men.&quot;    So far, Mr. Murray's most prominent symbol of authority has been the ax. Through attrition, early retirements and layoffs, he pared 6% of Mobil's work force in 1986. &quot;I was told by Mobil that it had reduced its head count by 10,000, to 154,000 between January and the end of June,&quot; says Michael Mayer, an analyst with Wertheim andamp; Co. and a Mobil executive until late last year. The company won't comment on the figures -- or on anything else in this story.    Last July, Mobil announced the sale of Container Corp. to Morgan Stanley and Jefferson Smurfit Corp. in the deal negotiated with Mr. Brennan. This reduced Mobil's payroll by an additional 18,000.    Mobil employees also say they received a letter at their homes early last summer warning of more cuts on the way. &quot;Murray told us we need to do more,&quot; one Mobil executive said. &quot;'Root out every savings you can find,' he told us.&quot;    Overseas operations have been shaved and some managers repatriated. But the sharpest cuts have come in the U.S. Tape recorders take messages at corporate headquarters for some executives who must now share secretaries. One executive tells of a colleague who came to work in the morning, was offered early retirement before his coffee had cooled, and told to be gone that afternoon.    Some 10% to 12% of the exploration and production staff has been eliminated. Regional marketing offices disappeared last summer, and the overall marketing and refining staff was cut 3% last year, according to one executive.    Since last January, at least 6,000 employees have left Montgomery Ward, Mobil's retail subsidiary, helping spark what Wertheim's Mr. Mayer calls a dramatic turnaround there. Ward's net earnings for 1986 soared an estimated 152% from 1985, to an estimated $106 million. If Ward's strategy to focus on specialty retailing is successful, adds Mr. Mayer, profits should continue upward, ending the unit's financial dependence on Mobil by next year. Mobil has done well to pay down over $1 billion in debt &quot;during the worst crisis in oil history,&quot; says Paul Mlotok, analyst for Salomon Brothers. Operating earnings last year, excluding one-time items, were up only slightly, although net after reflecting the heavy 1985 special charges was up 35%.    &quot;Compared to many U.S. major internationals, Mobil has been a bright star,&quot; says Philip Dodge, an analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc.    But Mr. Murray has his work cut out for him. Mobil still carries one of the most burdensome debt loads in the industry, with the borrowings representing 39% of Mobil's capitalization as of last September. It receives little cash flow from its Superior Oil acquisition of two years ago. At least one-third of Superior's North American natural-gas capacity is idled because of lagging demand.    A pudgy-faced Irish-American with an easy grin, Mr. Murray is rated by colleagues as more quick-witted than polished. Dubbed &quot;Archie Bunker&quot; by some, he reads up to four hours a day, but mostly newspapers and Mobil reports. &quot;You'd be more inclined to see him at a hockey game than a symphony,&quot; one executive says. &quot;And just because he would let {Herbert} Schmertz {head of Mobil's public-affairs department} spend money on art shows doesn't mean he gives a hoot about naked fertility statues,&quot; the executive says.    He is also a raucous card player and a golf fanatic with a 13 handicap and a temper that at least once moved him to throw his club on the ground, look at the sky and yell an epithet after hitting a ball off the fairway, a former colleague recalls. Otherwise, he apparently leads a quiet life.    &quot;I went over and said hello to him three or four years ago when he moved in,&quot; says Robert Blumberg, who lives across the street from Mr. Murray's sprawling hilltop ranch home in Long Island's Oyster Bay Estates. &quot;I haven't seen him since. Who is he anyway?&quot;    Mr. Murray was a protege of Mr. Tavoulareas, says Raymond D'Argenio, a former Mobil executive who knows both men. Alfred Geduldig, another former Mobil executive, adds, &quot;Both were brought up in the streets of New York City. Allen is tough-minded -- cut from the same street-smart mold as Tav,&quot; a Greek-Italian whose father was an immigrant. Like Mr. Tavoulareas, Mr. Murray fought his way out of the blue-collar neighborhood of his youth.    &quot;Allen considered himself a late bloomer,&quot; says Mr. Geduldig. &quot;He once told me that he didn't realize he had a good mind until he joined the Navy after high school. When he took a battery of tests and came out No. 1 in a Navy class of 500, he discovered he was smart.&quot; He got his college degree in accounting from New York University night school at age 27 after he had married and joined Mobil.    Despite his personnel cutbacks, Mr. Murray is popular with middle managers and industry analysts whom he has cultivated, like a campaigning politician, with small dinner meetings and lunches around the world and other gestures. &quot;I've talked with Murray four or five times since he's been president. I saw Tavoulareas once for 30 seconds,&quot; a New York-based executive says appreciatively.    But Mr. Murray is also known as a tough manager who has played by company rules. He once put a pipeline project on hold for about three months to discipline managers who flouted a requirement to refile project plans annually. &quot;Mobil executives were in the habit of ignoring the regulation, just requesting money when the need arose,&quot; one executive says. When Mr. Murray took charge of U.S. marketing and refining in 1969, he angrily retired a manager who had underpaid Mobil's own production group for crude oil while overcharging the marketing group for refined products. The manager &quot;was making himself look good at the expense of the corporation,&quot; a former executive recalls. &quot;Murray was irate.&quot;    Mr. Murray won't comment on his relationship with his predecessors at Mobil. (The company for the past two years has declined even to send press releases to The Wall Street Journal because of complaints about coverage of the company and its executives, and it won't respond to any inquiries from Journal reporters. It generally won't answer questions from this paper or grant interviews with its executives. Mobil officials have, however, answered questions from Wall Street Journal reporters at open press conferences. Before one such conference in Houston recently, Mr. Murray declined to be interviewed for this story. Asked why, he said over his shoulder as he walked away, &quot;Because you're writing a gossip column.&quot;)    Mobil executives and directors know that outsiders see Mr. Murray in a battle with the shadows of Messrs. Warner and Tavoulareas, but those who speak on the record say that is a misperception. On the contrary, &quot;Mr. Murray has proved himself to be strong, competent and independent,&quot; says Mobil director Jewel Lafontant, a Chicago lawyer.    Moreover, Mr. Tavoulareas has ceded his seat next to the chairman at the boardroom table to Richard Tucker, president of Mobil Oil Corp., a subsidiary, and has muted the frequency and ferocity of his remarks. &quot;When Warner was chairman, Tav would sometimes report to the board,&quot; Eleanor Sheldon, a director, says. Now, &quot;Tav may be asked questions, but he makes no formal presentations.&quot; She adds that although Mr. Tavoulareas is &quot;a very very important member of the board, Murray is very much in command.&quot;    But speaking privately, some Mobil insiders say that Mr. Tavoulareas still wields considerable power, and will continue to at least through the end of 1987. According to a proxy statement last May, he earned $800,000 as a part-time employee-consultant in 1985, only $246,000 less than Mr. Murray's full-time cash compensation. &quot;Tav still has an influence,&quot; says Bruce Lazier, analyst for brokers Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben and a former Mobil executive.    Indeed, Mobil executives say, Mr. Tavoulareas rarely misses a board meeting and still arranges all Mobil purchases of crude oil. He also retains a free hand to direct Mobil's Middle East operations where &quot;his role . . . hasn't changed at all,&quot; says a Mobil executive involved in the company's Middle East affairs.    Part of that role is to remain Mobil's key link to the world's largest oil reserves beneath the deserts of Saudi Arabia. As the man who spent years forging Mobil's Saudi ties, company executives say, Mr. Tavoulareas remains close to both the former Saudi oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani and to his recent successor, Hisham Nazer, with whom he held several telephone conversations since Mr. Yamani's departure.    Mr. Tavoulareas has also handled major Mobil asset sales, including the last-minute, late-night haggling on the Container Corp. price. But for all of Mr. Tavoulareas's manifest leverage, Mobil directors say he is only a trouble shooter following Mr. Murray's orders. Morgan Stanley's Mr. Brennan says of the Container Corp. sale: &quot;When Murray was reasonably sure that a deal could be struck, he told me, 'I want Tav to act as senior guy on the transaction. He knows the property. Work with him on a principal-to-principal basis.'&quot;    In any case, Mr. Tavoulareas's role has been cut back a bit this year, and his employee-consultant status is scheduled to end at the end of the year, Mobil sources say. They add that Mr. Murray and Mr. Tavoulareas understand each other and that their relationship is less a rivalry than a slow conveyance of a legacy.    Mr. Warner also remains on the scene. Mobil executives who have seen his three-room office suite on the 26th floor say it has a private secretary and designer furniture and expensive art.    But, having been superseded by Mr. Murray, he isn't around much of the time to enjoy the trappings.    ---                      A Heavy Debt Load                Debt-to-capitalization ratio                                                    SEPT.                1982     1983     1984     1985     1986 Mobil           34%      34%      49%      44%      39% Chevron         15       13       51       38       35 Exxon           20       16       18       21       19 Texaco          18       17       49       43       40   Source: Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
