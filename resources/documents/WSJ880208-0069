Gary Hart swallows it, and Robert Dole is tempted.    But Bruce Babbitt, Michael Dukakis and all the GOP presidential candidates except Mr. Dole say it's terrible and won't touch it. &quot;Flim-flam,&quot; Mr. Babbitt spits.    What the sparks are flying over is an oil-import fee, an idea born in the tense days of the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s and suddenly a hot topic in the 1988 presidential campaign.    It's likely to grow in importance as the campaign moves from Iowa to frigid New Hampshire, which relies heavily on home heating oil that would jump in price under an oil tariff. And it will draw even more -- and more sympathetic -- attention as ailing oil-producing states in the South prepare for their primaries on Super Tuesday, March 8. For the first time, the three leading oil producers -- Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma -- will hold their primaries on the same day.    Emergence of the oil-import tariff as a campaign issue &quot;reflects the importance of the oil states on Super Tuesday,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a Republican political strategist. One of the reasons discussed by oil states in changing their primary dates was &quot;making people pay attention to the oil and gas industry,&quot; he says.    The idea of taxing imported oil arose when oil was $40 a barrel, but is re-emerging now precisely because the price is down to around $17 and there's a world-wide oil glut. Low oil prices make it politically less painful to talk about a tax that not only would raise the cost of imported oil, but also would boost prices of domestic oil and refined products such as gasoline.    There are three driving forces behind the resurrection of the idea, and supporters juggle them to fit their policy or campaign stop. It's a convenient way to raise $5 billion to $12 billion a year to cut the federal budget deficit, depending how the per-barrel tax is structured. With the U.S. relying more heavily on overseas oil again while its warships cruise in the Persian Gulf, an oil tariff would induce Americans to conserve, enhancing energy security. And it would help the Southwest, where low oil prices have idled drilling rigs and wrecked local economies.    Of course, it has its downside -- economically and politically. It would raise costs for consumers, and thus could add to inflation.    A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows Americans are about evenly divided: 46% favor a tax on imported oil, 40% oppose it and 14% aren't sure. But what nationwide figures don't show is how an oil tariff pits region against region, which is what has killed the proposal every time it has been raised in Congress.    Energy-producing states tend to want it, while energy-consuming states, particularly in the Northeast, disdain it. In many ways, that forces candidates to choose between pleasing consumers in Iowa and New Hampshire or producers in the South.    &quot;There's no way you can be one of us in New England, especially in New Hampshire, and support an oil-import fee,&quot; says John Sununu, New Hampshire's governor and head of Vice President George Bush's state campaign committee. Gov. Sununu's admonition is aimed at Mr. Dole, who puzzles even his Republican rivals by being the only one in the GOP pack to say he would consider a fee on imported oil, although he doesn't propose one.    The Kansas senator's position has given him some grief as the Republicans try to differentiate among themselves. Mr. Bush, a former oil man who admits the fee is popular in Texas, tells Iowa families they would pay an extra $900 a year in energy costs with a $10-a-barrel oil-import fee. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York runs TV ads telling New Hampshire consumers that Sen. Dole &quot;supports&quot; an oil tax.    Even one of Mr. Dole's campaign strategists, William B. Lacy, concedes his candidate's position &quot;would be a marginal plus&quot; at best in a tight Super Tuesday race. But he says it hasn't hurt much in Iowa or New Hampshire. &quot;I don't think it was a political decision,&quot; Mr. Lacy says. &quot;He took the position for policy reasons.&quot;    In fact, there's ambiguity in Mr. Dole's position that may blunt criticism in New Hampshire while still sounding good in the Southwest. He's fuzzy about the circumstances under which he would propose an import fee, and says he would give rebates to home heating oil users and possibly others.    On the Democratic side, an oil-import fee is a way for candidates to take advantage of the Southwest's resentment of the Reagan administration for lacking an energy policy. An oil-industry official says people in his industry, even those who backed Mr. Reagan, feel the president has turned his back on them.    Thus, while the idea isn't particularly popular in their home states, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sen. Paul Simon, both of Illinois, say they would consider an oil-import fee and Rep. Gephardt of Missouri leads the charge for one as a way to bolster energy security and balance the budget. Gary Hart of Colorado has endorsed one for years. A cautious Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee doesn't rule one out, though he hasn't supported it in the past.    Driven by a regional bias, Gov. Dukakis of Massachusetts opposes an oil tax that would raise home heating bills. But he softens his message to oil men, instead proposing repeal of the 1980 windfall-profits tax and incentives to encourage new oil and gas exploration.    Certainly, the oil-import tax isn't such a gut-level issue, like abortion, that voters are likely to judge candidates on it alone. Even in the oil-producing states, where candidates behind an oil-import fee have the most to gain, support isn't universal.    Most of the major oil companies, which import some 38% of their crude oil, oppose one. Even independent oil producers, hardest hit by the slump in oil prices over the past five years, are split.    Midland, Texas, the heart of America's oil region where Mr. Bush started his own oil company in 1950, has been hurt by bank failures, job layoffs and depressed real estate values.    Perry Bolger runs his own operating and exploration company there and watched helplessly as oil rigs were idled. He favors an oil-import fee as a way for Washington to help hold down imports and shore up the domestic oil industry. But he says, &quot;There's another segment of the industry that says, 'We don't want the government in our business one iota, and this would just get them back in.'&quot;    ---   'Do you favor or oppose a tax on oil imported to this country?'
