North as a witness in theIran-Contra trial of former National Security Adviser JohnPoindexter.   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said prosecutors ``mayonly elicit evidence'' from North based on statements he madebefore July 15, 1987, the day Poindexter began testifying onCapitol Hill before a national television audience.   The restriction means the government is unable to use most ofthe testimony North gave at his own trial, last April, during whichhe frequently mentioned Poindexter, his former White House boss.   However, prosecutors will be allowed to elicit evidence fromNorth based on his testimony to Congress, which he gave prior toPoindexter's testimony, said the judge. The government also will bepermitted to delve into subjects to which Poindexter did nottestify.   Poindexter's trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 22 on charges ofconspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts ofmaking false statements.   At a pre-trial hearing last week, North repeatedly said he wasunable to separate in his mind his own experiences in theIran-Contra affair from what he learned by watching and readingPoindexter's testimony.   The judge was openly skeptical of North's contention, but saidhe would accept the assertion in order to protect Poindexter'srights.   ``The court takes North's alleged inability to differentiatewith a grain of salt,'' said Greene. ``It seems unlikely that awitness who was a major and active participant in the eventsthemselves would be unable to distinguish between the version ofevents described in another's testimony.''   The court's obligations, however, require it to ``err on theside of protecting Poindexter's constitutional right not to beconvicted with the use of his own testimony,'' said the judge.   Greene denied Poindexter's motion to dismiss the indictment ongrounds that it had been tainted by his congressional testimony,which he gave under a guarantee that it would not be used againsthim in court.   ``The court is confident that the government's trial witnesseswill testify from knowledge that is independent of the informationelicited from Poindexter at the congressional hearings,'' said thejudge.   Greene also allowed Iran-Contra prosecutors Dan Webb and HowardPearl to remain in the case, rejecting assertions by Poindexterthat they had been tainted by exposure to his congressionaltestimony. Greene said neither prosecutor has any recollection ofthe contents of Poindexter's testimony and therefore could make nouse of it.   A 1972 Supreme Court ruling says the prosecution must derive allits evidence in a case from sources wholly independent of testimonya defendant gave under a grant of immunity.   Greene's ruling means North will be limited in his testimonyabout a presidential finding which Poindexter tore up on Nov. 21,1986. The December 1985 finding retroactively legalized a November1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.   North testified at his trial that he watched Poindexter tear upthe finding _ which relates to four of the five criminal chargesagainst the ex-national security adviser. But North testified lastweek that he was certain it was the finding that was destroyed onlybecause Poindexter admitted it in his immunized testimony onnational TV.   ``I think that North has snaked his way around that'' and won'thave to testify at the trial about Poindexter tearing up thefinding, said John Nields, former chief counsel to the Housemajority staff in the congressional Iran-Contra hearings.   Nields said that since North did not tell the congressionalcommittees that he saw Poindexter destroy the finding, he ``won'tbe able to testify to it at the trial'' and ``I don't think thegovernment has any other proof of it.''   The prosecution says the finding which Poindexter destroyed is``the most critical document in proving the falsity'' of anotherdocument, a chronology which is an essential part of thegovernment's case against Poindexter.   Poindexter is accused of telling Congress the same day hedestroyed the finding that no one in the U.S. government knew until1986 that the November 1985 shipment to Iran contained Hawkmissiles.   py</TEXT></DOC>
