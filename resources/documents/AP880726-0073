The threat by Charles Z. Wick, director of the United StatesInformation Agency, is the latest development in a battle overallegations the agency has hampered international distribution ofdocumentaries with liberal themes.   Movies that are certified by the USIA as being of aneducational, scientific or cultural nature are exempt from importduties in some 60 countries under a 40-year-old internationaltreaty known as the Beirut Agreement.   The suit, filed in December 1985 on behalf of makers of movieson subjects ranging from Nicaragua to nuclear power, accuses theUSIA of, in effect, censoring the work of liberal moviemakers bymaking it more expensive to export their work.   Two courts have sided with the moviemakers, ordering the USIA torewrite its rules for determining whether a movie is of aneducational, scientific or cultural nature.   If the government fails to get the rulings reversed, Wick saidin a statement to be filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,``it is my intent to recommend that the United States terminate itsparticipation in the Beirut Agreement.''   An attorney for the seven moviemakers in the case, David Cole ofthe Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, called Wick'sresponse unreasonable.   ``It's like the kid with the football who says, `If I can't winthe game, I'm taking the ball home,'' Cole said in a telephoneinterview Monday.   Justice Department officials handling the case did not respondto a telephone request for comment.   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima sided with themoviemakers in 1986, ruling that the USIA policies violated themoviemakers' constitutional rights to free speech. He ordered theagency to redraft its rules.   Last May, Tashima rejected new rules, which included a provisionallowing the government to brand a movie propaganda.   The USIA has appealed that ruling and has asked the 9th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which upheld a challengeto Tashima's original ruling, to reconsider.   Wick wrote that the redrafted rules were a good-faith attempt toimplement the court order and that broadening the rules furtherwould amount to abandoning the treaty.   In keeping with its interpretation of the treaty, the agencydemanded that movies that advocate a point of view acknowledge thatanother point of view exists, Wick said.   Cole said his organization, a public interest lawyers group, andthe American Civil Liberties Union have drafted a proposed set ofrules for movie certification, but USIA officials had refused toconsider it.</TEXT></DOC>
