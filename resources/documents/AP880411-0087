Sessions told Senatehearings on organized crime today that law enforcement efforts haveseriously damaged, but not destroyed, the nation's organized crimefamilies.   Testifying at the most extensive Senate hearings on organizedcrime in nearly 25 years, Sessions said the FBI's extensiveintelligence system indicates that many organized crime enterprises``which have existed unfettered for years have been dismantled.''   Sessions told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee onInvestigations that the secrecy of the criminal underworld ``hasbeen co-opted'' by the cooperation of organized crime figures withthe FBI.   ``Most importantly, their ability to influence and intimidatethe business and political community is weakened,'' Sessions said.   The hearings were held amid stringent security measures, with ametal detector set up outside the hearing room. Inside the roomwere charts listing organized crime families of today and thecharts used in 1963, when convicted murderer Joseph Valachi,appearing before the same panel, introduced the phrase ``La CosaNostra'' into the national consciousness.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., opening the new hearing, said the crimefamily ``soldiers'' listed in the charts from the Valachi hearings``appear today among the highest-ranking powers in the LCN (La CosaNostra) families.''   Sessions, the leadoff witness, told the subcommittee, ``Thequestion most often asked is whether we have eradicated the LCN asa national threat. The simple answer is no. They continue to engagein a wide variety of criminal activities. ...''   Valachi was the star witness in the widely publicized 1963Senate investigation of organized crime, unfolding a complex storyof murder, terror, crime and vice. He described the La Cosa Nostraorganization and named alleged members.   Tommaso Buscetta, described as a former member of the PortoNuova Sicilian Mafia family in Palermo, Sicily, was scheduled totestify after Sessions.   The subcommittee has set four days of hearings this month _today, Friday, April 21 and April 22. Angelo Lonardo, described asthe former boss of the Cleveland La Cosa Nostra family, leads offFriday's hearings.   In the 1963 hearings, the 58-year-old Valachi, who was serving alife sentence in the Atlanta federal penitentiary, said La CosaNostra was a highly organized unit with a strict code guaranteed byblood ties and arranged marriages within the tight framework of thecrime syndicate.   He testified that the organization had been responsible for manygangland deaths throughout the country, including the slayings ofmobsters Albert Anastasi and Frank Scalise.   FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover called the Valachi case ``thebiggest intelligence breakthrough yet in combating organized crimeand racketeering in the United States.''   Attorney General Robert P. Kennedy said federal authorities had``full confidence'' in Valachi's testimony and called forcomprehensive legislation to deal with organized crime, includingnew federal wiretapping powers and immunity for witnesses inracketeering probes.   In announcing the new hearings, the panel's chairman, Sen. SamNunn, D-Ga., said, ``In the wake of an impressive array ofsuccessful prosecutions, it is important that we take stock andassess just how far we have come in the war against organizedcrime.''   ``Some have described the recent prosecutions of mob hierarchiesas the final death knell of La Cosa Nostra,'' he said. ``Othersargue that these prosecutions merely remove one mob hierarchy andreplace it with another _ as powerful and sometimes even morevicious than the old.''   Nunn said the subcommittee, as it did 25 years ago, will hearfrom witnesses who will describe how organized crime has surviveddespite periodically successful attacks by law enforcement agencies.   ``These hearings will not only try to determine if anyadditional law enforcement legislation is needed, but also whetherthe federal government is effectively using these tools that havealready been provided to them,'' Nunn said. ``In particular, we areinterested in reviewing the recent successful civil and criminalprosecutions under the 1970 racketeering statutes.   ``Not only will we be interested in the impact of those recentsuccesses but also the ability to transfer such tactics to otherareas of organized criminal activity _ particularly to the fieldsof labor racketeering, narcotics trafficking and other emergingorganized crime groups,'' he said.   Sen. William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Republican onthe subcommittee, said occasional successes in battling organizedcrime should not lead to complacency.   ``These secret criminal societies recognize only the law of thejungle and respect only the wealth of ill-gotten gain,'' Roth said.``We must recognize the new face of organized crime in thiscountry. It is important that we take this opportunity to examinewhether the strategies we've successfully used in the past will beeffective in the future.''</TEXT></DOC>
