''The competitivemarketplace can do a better job of setting prices for long-distance servicesthan the FCC can, and that should be allowed to happen.''andM;While ATandamp;T no longer holds a monopoly in its market, many observers say theRBHCs do, because they are almost always the sole providers of localtelephone service.andP;  On that count, many observers are predicting a resoundingdefeat of the Swift-Tauke bill, which is the third bill of its kind to beintroduced in the House since divestiture.andM;''You don't have to be a telecommunications expert to know that the Bellcompanies still have a monopoly over the local exchange service,'' said BrianMoir, attorney for the International Communications Association user group inDallas.andP;  ''We're not opposed to having more providers of information servicesor equipment, but we think the RBHCs are still abusing their monopoly powerand shouldn't be given any more power to enter and exploit new markets.''andM;Predictably, RBHC officials are lobbying hard for the bill's passage, sayingit represents an attempt by Congress to frame a new nationaltelecommunications policy in light of increasing international competition inthis arena.andM;''The Swift-Tauke bill marks the beginning of an important debate over thedevelopment of a national telecommunications policy,'' said A.andP;  Gray Collins,senior vice president of external affairs at the Philadelphia-based BellAtlantic Corp.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
