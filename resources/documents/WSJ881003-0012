Gordon Crovitz </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><TEXT>   &quot;Our positions are mainstream positions,&quot; says Norman Dorsen, president of the American Civil Liberties Union, defending his organization in the wake of George Bush making an issue out of Michael Dukakis's boast of card-carrying membership. The ACLU does have a long history of efforts to protect actual constitutional rights, but a sampling of its recent positions can allow voters to decide for themselves where the mainstream lies.    The best source for the ACLU's positions and world view is its own 576-page listing, last published in 1986, of &quot;Policy Guides,&quot; which are approved by the national board; local branches often take more radical positions. Here is a primer on the ACLU as a mainstream organization:   Drugs should not be prohibited by law. Without mentioning the word &quot;deterrent,&quot; the ACLU voted to legalize everything from heroin to marijuana. &quot;Gambling, attempted suicide, sexual relations or the introduction of substances into one's own body&quot; should not be crimes. (Policy 210, Victimless Crimes.) Drug use is akin to catching a cold: &quot;There is today widespread recognition of the fact that narcotics addiction is at bottom an illness to be treated and not a crime to be punished.&quot; (Policy 214, State Control of Drugs and Alcohol.)    School discipline must be strictly limited. Despite nearly universal problems in urban high schools, &quot;the school has no jurisdiction over its students' non-school activities.&quot; This explains ACLU opposition to the more than 50 school districts nationwide that have banned electronic beepers from the classroom. These are now a key tool of the school drug trade. A spokesman for the group's privacy and technology project says, &quot;The school has the burden of proof to show that the beepers are disruptive and not being banned because they are linked with illegal drugs.&quot; The ACLU is consistent -- it also tried, unsuccessfully, to protect students from searches of their lockers. (Policy 76, Secondary School Students' Civil Liberties.)    Few crimes should be punished by jail. &quot;A fine should always be the preferred form of the penalty,&quot; the ACLU says. For those who do go to jail, &quot;probation should be authorized by the legislature in every case, exceptions to the principle are not favored, and any exceptions, if made, should be limited to the most serious offenses, such as murder or treason.&quot; The group does not mention furloughs. (Policy 242, Criminal Sentences.)    Workfare is unconstitutional. Citing &quot;basic concerns of fairness, dignity and privacy,&quot; the ACLU &quot;opposes work requirements at government-assigned tasks as a condition of eligibility for welfare benefits or for any transfer payments designed to compensate for insufficient income.&quot; Presumably, the group will sue against the welfare-reform program Congress just passed. (Policy 318, Poverty and Civil Liberties.)    The Constitution mandates increased welfare spending. Welfare &quot;classifications which exclude some people from the basic necessities of life, while granting such necessities to others, are constitutionally 'suspect.'&quot; This is the legal argument, so far rejected by the Supreme Court, that the group is using with some success in state courts. It translates immediately into taxpayer or third-party obligations and invalidates reforms encouraging an end to welfare dependency. (Policy 318, Poverty and Civil Liberties.)    Equal pay for equal work is not enough. &quot;The current ACLU policy on sex and race discrimination in employment encompasses the concept of comparable worth as the essential next step in achieving full equality for women and minorities.&quot; (Policy 315, Employment and Education.)    No more rescue attempts of American hostages or secret operations against terrorists. &quot;Abolish all covert operations.&quot; (Policy 117, Controlling the Intelligence Agencies.)    There can be no military draft, even in wartime. Although the Supreme Court has ruled against the ACLU, the organization's position remains that &quot;military conscription, under any circumstances, is a violation of civil liberties and constitutional guarantees. . . . at least in the absence of an extreme national emergency as defined by ACLU.&quot; (Policy 120, Conscription.)    U.S. officials owe U.S. constitutional protections to foreigners overseas. The ACLU says the &quot;Constitution requires the same standard of conduct for government personnel (whether civilian or military) overseas as it requires at home.&quot; Presumably, if he's ever arrested, Gen. Manuel Noriega must get Miranda rights read to him or be set free; by the same reasoning, poppy farmers in South America have a Fifth Amendment taking claim if the U.S. sprays their land. (Policy 401, ACLU Role in International Civil Liberties Matters.)    Churches and synagogues should lose their tax-exempt status. Contrary to hundreds of years of Anglo-American practice, &quot;the ACLU opposes tax benefits for religious bodies.&quot; The group's reasoning is that &quot;the free exercise clause is put at risk when the establishment clause is breached.&quot; The group has litigated against the Catholic Church in particular. One complaint against the Catholics is that they oppose abortion and thus the church is a political entity; of course, churches are in the business of expressing themselves on matters of ethics. (Policy 92, Religious Bodies' Tax Exemption.)    The First Amendment protects all pornography, including child porn. &quot;The ACLU opposes any restraint on the right to create, publish or distribute materials . . . on the basis of obscenity, pornography or indecency.&quot; The procurers of children who appear in kiddie porn can be punished for crimes under the rubric of child abuse -- if the police can catch them -- but sellers and distributors are absolutely protected regardless of the content -- that is, regardless of what the little boys and/or little girls are doing or having done to them on screen. (Policy 4, Censorship of Obscenity, Pornography and Indecency.)    Rating movies is itself an unconstitutional prior restraint. The ACLU opposes the industry rating system for parental guidance that categorizes movies from X- to G-rated. &quot;Rating systems create the potential for constraining the creative process&quot; and &quot;inevitably have serious chilling effects on freedom of expression,&quot; the ACLU says. For example, &quot;hotels, airlines, pay television . . . frequently refuse to accept X-rated films.&quot; Does the ACLU want &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; shown on transcontinental flights? (Policy 18, Rating Systems Sponsored by the Communications Industries.)    Prostitution should be legal. &quot;The ACLU supports the decriminalization of prostitution and opposes state regulation of . . . prostitutes of both sexes.&quot; Prostitution is protected by &quot;the right of individual privacy,&quot; and solicitation comes under the First Amendment. (Policy 211, Prostitution.)    Homosexuals can be foster parents. In 1986, the ACLU radicalized its position on non-discrimination against homosexuals to include all rights that would &quot;qualify gay and lesbian couples for benefits and rights enjoyed by married persons, including the right to become foster parents.&quot; In lawsuits, the ACLU has also tried to establish the right for homosexuals to become Big Brothers and to marry. (Policy 264, Homosexuality.)    The deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill was required by law. Beginning in the early 1960s, the ACLU led the fight to empty the nation's mental institutions. The leading principle was that &quot;mental illness cannot by itself be a justifiable reason for depriving a person of liberty against his or her objection.&quot; There could be commitment in limited circumstances, for example where there is &quot;an observable violent criminal act against self or others in a time period immediately preceding or during the commitment process.&quot; In any case, &quot;the individual has a right to counsel at every step of the proceeding&quot; and &quot;an involuntarily committed individual must be allowed to refuse any treatment for mental illness.&quot; See, for example, Joyce Brown, New York City. (Policy 244, Civil Commitment.)    It's perfectly fine for the ACLU to argue these positions. Indeed, it's probably healthy for society to have a fringe group agitating new &quot;rights.&quot; But others are entitled to criticize these positions as having little to do with the Constitution or, for that matter, with common sense. After all, a president who belongs to the ACLU has many chances to implement its policies, from passing new laws to repealing old ones to nominating federal judges and Supreme Court justices.    Certainly, voters have a right to decide whether they want a president who enthusiastically associates himself with these views, or at least with the political outlook that gives rise to them.    ---   Mr. Crovitz is assistant editorial page editor f the Journal.
