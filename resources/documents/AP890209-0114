The country's top general, Mohammad Assef Delawar, saidauthorities planned to move residents from the villages ofShakadara, Karabargh, Kalakan, Bagram and Mirbachakot.   Delawar said the evacuation had not yet begun. He gave noschedule and did not say how many people would be affected.   The villages are about 45 miles north of Kabul along a stretch ofthe Salang highway, the route departing Soviet soldiers are using toreturn home before their Feb. 15 withdrawal deadline.   ``We are evacuating for security reasons, not to harm them,''Delawar said. ``These people (the guerrillas) are highway robbersand plunderers. If the people are not able to move them out, thearmed forces will help them. We will defend them.''   Heavy shelling and bombings have been heard in the area in thepast week.   In Moscow, Soviet TV said Thursday night that Soviet convoys onthe Salang Highway heading home have been shelled only once, and oneSoviet soldier was killed. No date was given for the attack. Earlierin the day, however, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimovsaid, ``Rebels have not interfered with the withdrawal of Soviettroops.''   Most of Delawar's 20-minute news conference was spent onpolitical rather than military issues.   He and other Afghan military officers refused to disclose thestrength of the armed forces, although foreign diplomats haveestimated the number at about 140,000.   Asked about the ability of the armed forces to defend the countryafter the Soviet's leave, the general said, ``The army is mightyenough to defend the cause of peace and the people. We have enoughpeople and adequate weapons and our army is qualified to defend thecountry.''   Delawar refused comment on the morale of his troops.   There have been reports some soldiers posted along the Salanghighway have defected and that two helicopter crews defectedWednesday in Pakistan.   Concerns about the Afghan army's ability to defend the capitalprompted Western nations to pull out their diplomats. Some diplomatshave predicted Kabul will collapse within months after the Sovietsare gone.   ``This is not the first time the opposition has claimed they willconquer Kabul. We want to make it clear that the government willsurvive. No one can conquer Kabul,'' Delawar said.   Earlier this week, the government said weapons had been handedout to 30,000 members of the ruling People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan to help them defend their homes and neighborhoods.   The Soviets entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to back thegovernment in its war with Moslem guerrillas. Under a U.N.-mediatedaccord signed last year, they are to have all their troops out byFeb. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
