The order for a seven-day strike, which would be the longest inthe 20-month-old uprising, came along with a call for ``more stonesand knives'' in fighting Israeli occupation.   A Palestinian man died Tuesday of a gunshot wound suffered a dayearlier in a clash with soldiers, the army said.   The death brought to 536 the number of Palestinians killed bysoldiers or Jewish settlers since the uprising began in the WestBank and Gaza Strip in December 1987. Thirty-eight Israelis havebeen killed.   Sixteen other Palestinans were reported shot and wounded Tuesdayin confrontations with soldiers in the occupied lands, according toArab reports. One of the victims, a 14-year-old girl from the Askarrefugee camp near Nablus, was reported in critical condition with abullet in the head.   The PLO-backed underground leaders of the uprising said in acommunique that the strike should begin Friday, the day the armybegins enforcing a new rule that requires Gaza Strip Palestinians toshow computerized ID cards to enter Israel.   Cards are denied anyone considered a security risk.   More than 50,000 Gazans work in Israel, as do about 60,000Palestinians from the West Bank.   The uprising leaders called the cards ``a policy of starvation''that would deny Arabs work and said West Bank Palestinians who didnot strike in sympathy for those in the Gaza Strip would beconsidered ``betrayers.''   It also called for an escalation of the fight against Israelioccupation and ordered Palestinians not to meet with Israelis who donot support the goals of an independent Palestinian state. It said``anybody who breaks this decision will be outside the nationalline.''   Israeli officials have held a series of meetings with Palestinianleaders to try to persuade them to accept the government's peaceplan, which calls for elections in the occupied lands but rules outan independent Palestinian state.   The 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied territories closedtheir shops and offices Tuesday in response to a strike call by theMoslem fundamentalist Hamas movement.   Another commercial strike has been called Wednesday by theunderground leadership.   The Palestinian who died Tuesday was identified by an armyspokeswoman as Ahmed Abdel Khaled Ayub, 23, of the Fara refugee campnear Nablus.   The spokeswoman said Ayub was shot in the back Monday whensoldiers opened fire on youths who attacked an army patrol ``atclose range with large stones and concrete blocks.''   Several thousand camp residents raised Palestinian flags andchanted pro-PLO slogans at a funeral procession for Ayub, Arabreporters said.   The army ordered a curfew on the camp after the funeral,confining the 5,000 residents to their homes.</TEXT></DOC>
