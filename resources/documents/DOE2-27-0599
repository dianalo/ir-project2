As lack of such attachment is a relative indication for surgery,we studied the feasibility of using coronal computed tomography (CT)after double contrast arthrography to demonstrate attachment in fourpatients with osteochondritis dissecans seen on radiographs. Direct coronalCT arthrographic images showed intact articular cartilage in three patients.In the fourth patient, overlying cartilage was virtually absent and contrasttracked beneath the fragment, an appearance that correlated with arthroscopicfindings of partial articular cartilage attachment and no union at theosteochondral fracture line. Our initial experience suggests that directcoronal CT arthrography clearly shows the state of attachment of theosteochondritic fragment to the talus.</TEXT></DOC>
