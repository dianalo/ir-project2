 Many text-based applications that are accessed via thetried-and-true character-cell terminal could derive great advantage fromwindow- and menu-based interfaces.andP;  Numerous utilities have arrived on thescene to bring user interfaces to text terminals.andM;Vectus Technologies' V-Windows is a set of libraries and programs that offersprogrammers a simple commandline--style interface to screen management (SMG)routines and allows those routines to be used directly from DCL without anyprogramming.andM;V-Windows is not X windows or DECwindows for text-based terminals.andP;  BecauseV-Windows is layered completely on SMG and is &quot;open,&quot; an applicationdeveloper can mix the use of V-Windows and direct calls to SMG within oneapplication.andM;V-Windows also adds features to those routines for data entry forms, textediting and menus, and mouse support.andP;  In short, the V-Windows packagebridges the gap between SMG and full-fledged forms managers like DEC'sTerminal Data Management System (TDMS), Forms Management System (FMS) andDECforms.andM;MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTSandM;Five modules make up the V-Windows package (Fig.andP;  1).andP;  V-Video, the basicportion, provides a commandline interface to the SMG run-time libraryroutines.andP;  A programmer constructs screens by calling a single module with asingle parameter that contains the V-Video commands.andM;V-Forms provides facilities for displaying a data entry form and subsequentlypassing validated data on to another part of the application (which could beDCL or an application program in which the V-Forms forms are embedded).andM;V-Edit permits text to be displayed and edited within a V-Windows window.andO;V-Edit is also the facility by which a programmer can build and use menus.andM;V-Mouse allows a user to add a mouse or similar pointing device to a textterminal that does not already have one.andP;  With such a device, an applicationdeveloper can navigate around the screen, select items from menus and performpoint-and-click interaction with the application.andM;V-Exec provides a means by which V-Windows commands are executedinteractively from DCL.andM;Using all these modules, developers can display different types of windowssimultaneously.andP;  For instance, they can display windows with several lines oftext and a mix of different attributes, such as underlining and boldfacetype; V-Edit windows with the contents of RMS text files; and V-Edit selectbuffers that enable V-Windows to implement menus (Fig.andP;  2).andM;Any one of the five V-Windows modules can be called from a higher-levelprogramming language.andP;  A call to one of V-Windows' modules must include asingle parameter--a V-Windows command line or a reference to a commandprocedure that contains V-Windows commands.andM;The subroutine name associated with the call depends on which module is beingcalled.andP;  For example, the subroutine VIDEO is used to make calls to theV-Video and V-Edit modules, and the subroutine FORMS is used to make calls tothe V-Forms module.andM;The V-Windows command line, whether it is issued from DCL or within anapplication, can also incorporate command-line macros.andP;  These are useful forperforming data transfer, date/time formatting and mathematical operations inthe command line before it is executed.andM;By default, a macro begins with a percent sign.andP;  If the macro has parameters,the list of parameters by default must be enclosed in braces ({}).andP;  Thesedefault characters can be changed with the V-Video command SET TRANSLATE.andM;A developer has several ways to pass data between V-Windows and DCL or anapplication program.andP;  Data can be passed from DCL to V-Windows with the%SYMBOL and %LOGICAL macros, which permit the translation of a DCL symbol andVMS logical name, respectively.andP;  Data can be returned to DGL with the /OUTPUTqualifier, which is available with the appropriate V-Windows commands and,again, can accept the %SYMBOL and %LOGICAL macros.andM;The V-Video CONVERT command can be used to convert between data types.andP;  Itcan also be used to load data into variables or unload them when using anapplication program.andM;Data can be shared between an application program and V-Windows with globalstorage areas--for example, COMMON data blocks for Fortran.andP;  Thesedata-passing techniques apply to all the V-Windows modules.andP;  Currently,V-Windows can be called from Fortran, Basic and Cobol programs.andP;  According toVectus officials, the company will add C and Pascal to the list in the nextrelease.andM;V-Video is very similar to the SMG package on which it is layered.andP;  It usescommon concepts and terminology, including pasteboards (logical outputdevices typically associated with a physical terminal), windows (rectangularportions of the display that are visible only when attached to a pasteboard),keyboards (logical input devices) and key tables (which provide alternatedefinitions for keystrokes entered at a keyboard).andP;  V-Video includes 49commands.andM;All the features available directly from SMG are also available throughV-Video, including display attributes such as boldface or reverse video, linedrawing, moving items and data input.andM;COMMON INTERFACEandM;V-Video's use of a command-line interface proved to be much easier than SMGfor getting applications up and running.andP;  It was quite refreshing not toworry about the programming details of passing parameters to SMG routineswith the proper mechanisms and data types.andM;The interface for the DCL level and the programming level of V-Windows isbasically the same.andP;  It takes the form of a command language whose syntax iswell-known to VMS aficionados: the DCL syntax.andM;V-Windows commands consist of a verb that can be followed by a number ofparameters and qualifiers.andM;To create the leftmost window in Fig.andP;  2, we used a short series of V-Windowcommands and qualifiers (Fig.andP;  3).andP;  We could have omitted the CREATEPASTEBOARD command because other commands that require a pasteboard willautomatically create one if none exists.andP;  The second line created a borderedwindow, called Generic window #1.andP;  The window's location was determined bytwo DCL symbols, Row and Column, which were translated by the % Symbol{}macro.andM;We added a label to this window with the CREATE BORDER command and specifiedthat the label be placed on the window's bottom border.andP;  We then displayedthree lines of text (the row in which the text will appear was incrementedafter each command) with the DISPLAY LINE commands.andP;  The first two lines ofthe displayed text were given the underline and boldface video attributes;the third line displayed plain text and also used DCL symbol substitution.andM;V-Forms is very similar to V-Video in command syntax and its use from eitherDCL or an application program, but it provides capabilities beyond those ofV-Video.andP;  Specifically, it permits the definition of data entry forms thatcan be displayed to allow input from the user, data fields that can bevalidated and the form itself, complete with required, validated fields.andO;This data can then be transmitted back DCL or an application program.andM;V-Forms includes two elements: Builder, which runs separately and translatesan ASCII form-definition file into a binary format, and Driver, whichactually displays the form and handles input to it and validation.andP;  We foundthe error messages from Builder to be too cryptic.andM;A wide range of data entry form options is available with V-Forms.andP;  Forinstance, in a client information form, the phone number field can use aV-Forms predefined telephone number data type, the state field can be set upto uppercase alphabetic characters and the ZIP code field can be set up as aright-justified, digits-only field.andM;Similarly, in an order-information form, the style and quantity fields can beright-justified and the date fields can use a V-forms predefined-date datatype that handles all the necessary validations (Fig.andP;  4).andM;Unfortunately, V-Forms does not provide a visual forms design feature.andP;  Formshave to be designed by entering text commands.andP;  A programmer can preview theform before intergrating it with the application to ensure its desiredappearance.andM;We found that the lack of a visual forms designer was quite a drawback.andP;  Theprocess of defining a form is quite complex, and it would have been immenselyhelpful to have had an interface to assist in this task.andP;  Vectus plans toincorporate a visual forms designer in a future release of V-Forms, though nodate has been set.andM;V-Forms is quite powerful nevertheless, and this added layer of code abovethe SMG routines can be put to good use--the order entry form is a primeexample.andM;There are only 15 commands in V-Forms, but a lot of them are very complex andhave many qualifiers.andP;  The DEFINE BUFFER and DEFINE ENTITY commands, forexample, both have 30 or more qualifiers.andM;Using the V-Edit module, an application developer can display and edit textbuffers in pop-up windows that can be layered on top of existing SMG windows.andO;The V-Edit function-key mapping is similar to the mapping that is employed bythe VMS EDT text editor.andM;V-Edit has three modes: edit, in which the entire contents of a buffer areavailable for editing; display, in which the buffer is displayed but cannotbe modified; and display and select, in which menu options can be displayedand a single-line menu item can be selected from the buffer.andM;V-Edit was satisfactory for our purposes of evaluation, but it would havebeen nicer if there had been a dedicated menuing facility because this methodof doing menus was a bit quirky.andP;  V-Edit menus are simply specialized textbuffers, complete with a misleading &quot;end of buffer&quot; indicator at the bottomof the window.andM;V-Edit is very flexible regarding the source of the text to be displayed oredited in an edit buffer.andP;  It can come from user-supplied strings (programvariables, DCL symbols or logical names), text files or sections within atext or help library.andM;The V-Edit facility worked very well, but we found that it was too sluggishto be used as an alternative to a real text editor like EDT, EVE or Emacs.andM;These are four commands in V-Edit: CREATE BUFFER, DELETE BUFFER, DISPLAYBUFFER and EDIT BUFFER.andP;  Applications using V-Edit may also have to employthe SYS_XFERBUF() subroutine to transfer data to or from an edit buffer.andM;The V-Mouse module consists of software and hardware that allows a mouse tobe attached to a text terminal to give the terminal some additionalcapabilities.andM;The hardware component of V-Mouse is, in fact, the ANSI Locator from Giga ofHolon, Israel, and has been reviewed by DR Labs.andP;  (See &quot;Mousing on VTterminal,&quot; DR, Jan. 23, 1989, page 43.)andP;  It consists of a Logitech orcompatible mouse that plugs into a small plastic box.andP;  The terminal alsoplugs into this box, and the box then plugs into the host computer orterminal server.andM;V-Windows includes 27 comprehensive commands for handling the mouse, allowingcontrol over how it positions items and selects functions and options, andhow the rest of V-Windows interacts with it.andM;On the whole, however, we found that V-Windows doesn't benefit much from theaddition of the mouse.andP;  The mouse functions as a pointing device, and eventhough it can be used to move the cursor around the screen and select items,it doesn't have the same precision that most users of high-resolutionworkstations are used to.andM;Users who have experience working with a mouse on a real workstation willfind the V-Windows' mouse capabilities somewhat limited.andP;  We opted not to usethe mouse for most of our V-Windows evaluation because we found it just asefficient to use the terminal keyboard to initiate actions.andM;The V-Exec portion of V-Windows provides the best means for V-Windows to beused from DCL.andP;  V-Exec creates a subprocess that actually runs the V-windowsprograms and lets commands be passed from the parent process to thesubprocess for execution.andM;Using V-Exec is not required, but the documentation points out two advantagesof doing so: The V-Windows images are only activated once in the subprocess,and the display of all windows is maintained.andM;If V-Windows is run directly from DCL rather than through the subprocess,then each time the user exits from V-Windows--for example, to perform someother DCL command--the display is erased and must be recreated the next timeone enters the product.andM;SIMPLE INSTALLATIONandM;The installation of V-Windows was very easy, thanks to the familiar VMSINSTALcommand procedure.andP;  The only questions we had to answer during installationhad to do with determining where the V-Windows files would be stored.andP;  Weelected to place them on our user disk rather than on the somewhat more fullsystem disk; we experienced no problems with placing V-Windows in thisnon-default location.andM;The accompanying documentation is reasonably well-written and quite hefty,having separate sections for each of the five modules.andP;  It breaks thecardinal rule of technical documentation, however: It does not have an index.andO;In addition, its organization is not always straightforward.andP;  We would havepreferred more examples earlier in the documentation rather than after allthe command descriptions, which are quite detailed.andM;In our estimation, V-Windows commands an interesting middle ground as far asa command-language development tool for window-based applications goes.andP;  Itis not DECwindows for text terminals, as some other packages claim to be, butit does offer some windowing capabilities.andP;  The V-Forms module certainlyaspires to a full-fledged forms management system, even though it needs someenhancements--a visual forms designer, for one--before it qualifies.andM;Nonetheless, we were pleasantly surprised to discover how much acommand-line-style interface can streamline the use of SMG routines, and thatis what we found most attractive about Vectus Technologies' V-windows.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
