A police spokesman put the casualty toll from four days ofclashes at 76 killed and 200 wounded.   The spokesman, speaking under ground rules of anonymity, saidabout 2,500 army commandos and 2,000 Lebanese Forces militiameninvolved in fighting that rocked east Beirut and the hills above thecapital were confined to their barracks.   Only riot police in red berets and traffic police were on view ascivil defense squads and municipality workers cleared broken glass,burned-out cars, fallen pine trees and broken power cables from thestreets.   Civilian mediators shuttled between army commander Gen. MichelAoun and Samir Geagea, leader of the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces,the Christians' main militia, trying to strengthen the cease-fire.   The six-member committee of parliamentarians commuted betweenAoun's hilltop command in suburban Yarze and Geagea's walledheadquarters in the seaside Karantina district.   Reporters touring the area did not find army or militiacheckpoints on the main streets of Beirut's Christian sector or inthe hillside suburbs, including the Aukar district that houses theU.S. Embassy.   Lebanese staff from the embassy blocked the only road to thesprawling compound, telling reporters neither Ambassador JohnMcCarthy nor any of his American staff were there.   The embassy shut down when it was caught in the crossfire duringWednesday's fighting. Defense Department officials in Washingtonsaid at least 13 diplomatic workers were evacuated Friday to Cyprus,leaving 25 others behind.   The committee was reporting later to Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir,spiritual head of the dominant Maronite Catholic community whomediated Wednesday's cease-fire. Both Aoun and Geagea are Maronites.   Geagea, 38, on Friday announced he was ordering his militiamenback to their barracks at the request of Sfeir and a group of 31senior Christian politicians who met with the patriarch to defusethe confrontation.   Aoun, 53, whose 20,000 predominantly Christian troops control 75percent of the Christian enclave, had earlier threatened to unleashan ``apocalypse'' to wipe out the Lebanese forces.   The capital has been divided into Moslem and Christian sectorssince civil war broke out in 1975. The crossings between the twozones were re-opened Saturday after three days of closure.</TEXT></DOC>
