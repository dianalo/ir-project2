Hospice-Style Care; Some Can't Afford Either --- Zack Stays Near Toy Trains </HL><AUTHOR> Marilyn Chase (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> PHA INS </IN><TEXT>   For AIDS's youngest victims, those born with the virus, life passes with brutal speed. &quot;Sick by six months, dead by two years -- that's the usual story,&quot; says James Oleske of Children's Hospital of New Jersey.    As the number of children with AIDS grows, so does the debate over how to give them the best care during their short lives. Some doctors want to slow the disease with potent high-tech drugs. Other child advocates, citing the drugs' harmful side effects and the long odds against success, argue for simple comfort and hospice-style care. Still others -- particularly doctors in the inner cities -- find the debate irrelevant. They are so understaffed and poorly financed that they have to practice a kind of triage, lurching from crisis to crisis.    The official count of children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome stands at about 1,000, but the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and others believe that the actual number is closer to 3,000 cases. About three quarters of the children got AIDS from their parents, often as a legacy of intravenous drug use. By 1991, pediatric experts say, as many as 20,000 children may be infected. &quot;We are going to find many more children than we dreamed,&quot; says Antonia C. Novello, a pediatrician and the deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a unit of the National Institutes of Health.    So far, children have had little voice in the nation's AIDS agenda. &quot;No advocacy groups have arisen to speak for them,&quot; says Philip Pizzo, the chief of the pediatrics branch of the National Cancer Institute. But that is changing as doctors and child specialists set up more drug tests and start to work out a standard of care. Bioethicists, religious groups and parents are joining with doctors to try to balance science and succor for what Dr. Novello calls &quot;these little bodies that we're forever pincushioning.&quot;    The problem is that &quot;best care&quot; means different things to different people. In the corridors of the NIH in Bethesda, Md., Dr. Pizzo plans a high-tech assault on the AIDS virus, sending his young patients home with little backpacks carrying portable infusion pumps that send the antiviral drug AZT throughout their bodies. The pumps can be reprogrammed by telephone to alter dosages, and he says that one of his young patients recently resumed riding a bicycle.    In Sonoma County, Calif., a Catholic lay order that offers shelter for AIDS children argues that love is the best balm for terminally ill children. &quot;What they need is to be kids and to celebrate life,&quot; says Brother Tolbert, one of the members of the Starcross Community. A three-year-old girl is splashing in a bird bath outside as he explains his opposition to the institutional approach, including his fear that researchers will reduce children to mere statistics. When a one year old died at Starcross recently, Brother Tolbert says, &quot;he was surrounded by love.&quot;    In Harlem, where the press of reality precludes debating love vs. research, Elaine Abrams says that she is worried about a 20-bed ward that has only one nurse and one nurse's aide at night. The hospital tried to entice relatives of AIDS babies to help at feeding and bathing time by permitting visitors 24 hours a day, but few mothers came. Dr. Abrams doesn't only perform tests and give drugs. She also intervenes in suspected child-abuse cases and builds the ward's toy boxes. &quot;Our research priorities?&quot; she hoots. &quot;Just send money.&quot;    AIDS is different -- and often tougher to diagnose -- in children than it is in adolescents and adults. &quot;Children get sicker sooner and die sooner,&quot; says Dr. Oleske, whose hospital has cared for 250 children -- 100 now dead -- in the Newark area. More than 90% of children with AIDS suffer neurological damage and brain disease. The symptoms first appear as an inability to sit, walk or speak -- skills that often disappear before a parent's eyes.    AIDS attacks different systems and kills by different infections in children than in adults. Immune-suppressed children often die of illnesses like chicken pox, meningitis, measles and pneumonia. Tumors, clotting disorders, heart defects and strokes are also common. Many children suffer malabsorption -- an inability to take nutrients from their food -- and slowly starve to death. Children born with AIDS often have a special stigma as well -- clubbed or hammer-tipped fingers because of lack of oxygen.    So far, tests of drugs for pediatric AIDS have been scattered and small, with only limited gains reported. &quot;On the one hand, you don't want a drug that's toxic to developing organs,&quot; says Arye Rubenstein of Albert Einstein Medical Center in New York. &quot;On the other hand, you know the brain will be affected by the virus and it will bring irreversible brain damage.&quot; He helped to pioneer the use of monthly intravenous gamma globulin infusions that can help prevent bouts of infections in children with AIDS. He also uses steroids on children suffering a special pneumonia called LIP.    Such care helps relieve AIDS symptoms but doesn't attack the root cause, the virus HIV. Testing anti-virals like AZT, a potent drug with toxic side effects, carries larger potential benefits and risks. The NIH's Dr. Pizzo has tested AZT in several dozen children -- especially those with neurological problems. Several colleagues have already characterized the work as &quot;exciting,&quot; and he hopes to publish the results soon. Still, AZT does seem to cause eventual bone-marrow depletion and anemia in children as well as adults.    Daniel Hoth, who heads AIDS drug development at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is coordinating a multi-drug assault on pediatric AIDS. Combination drug tests are planned, along with tests of newer anti-virals like AZT's sister drugs, DDC and DDA, and the synthetic CD4 molecule being developed by Genentech Inc. and others. Future strategies may include tests of AZT in newborns and infected pregnant women.    Dr. Hoth advocates introducing new anti-virals in children as early as possible. &quot;I know we'll meet with resistance,&quot; he says. &quot;People will say there's a danger. You're damn right there's a danger. But there's a lot greater danger in dying from the disease.&quot;    Dr. Pizzo is encouraged by the experience with childhood leukemia, which was swiftly fatal in the 1950s but is now curable in more than half the cases with chemotherapy. &quot;One has to be realistic. AIDS is a fatal disease,&quot; he says. &quot;But I believe to my core that we're going to find a solution.&quot;    These pediatric experiments stir passion, though -- in part because children can't decide themselves whether to accept the risks and pain of drug testing. The patients' parents do have to give consent, but many of them are themselves infected or ill.    At the Starcross Community, members of the religious order argue that abandoned children are especially vulnerable. &quot;A baby whose mother isn't in the picture becomes public property,&quot; says Brother Tolbert. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, the psychiatrist-author of &quot;On Death and Dying,&quot; agrees. &quot;Children need advocates who have only the baby's welfare at heart,&quot; she says, &quot;not research, fame or money.&quot;    At the NIH, consent procedures for children with cancer formerly required children who were seven or older to sign &quot;pediatric assent&quot; forms. But that proved unworkable, Dr. Pizzo says. Now, he meets with each family for more than an hour to discuss risks and benefits. So far, &quot;every family has been prepared to go forth,&quot; he says.    The NIH bars interviews with the parents of its AIDS babies. But other mothers say that easy answers about the research experience elude them. Samuel Kushnick, who got AIDS from tainted transfusions at birth in 1980, received the then-experimental drug pentamidine for pneumonia before his death at age three. &quot;What they learned from Sam is now helping others,&quot; says his mother, Helen. &quot;But did {the drug} help him live 19 days more? I don't know.&quot;    &quot;Research has to be conducted in children, but you have to weigh the pain and agony,&quot; adds Anna Belle Fried, a Los Angeles mother whose son Zachary died of transfusion-borne AIDS in December. &quot;Zack received AZT just six weeks before he died. Maybe if he had gotten it sooner, it would have extended his life.&quot;    Dr. Pizzo says that after &quot;battling bioethicists&quot; at the NIH, his team has worked out a fair compromise and was recently allowed to start a small, very low-dose pilot study of DDC, which has caused nerve damage in some adult patients.    Bioethicist Ernest Wallwork, who has helped establish the NIH guidelines for research into pediatric AIDS, notes: &quot;Anything offered to infants at this point isn't cure but therapy with side effects. And if there's pain, that's a great concern.&quot; He urges researchers to start with older children first, say ages five to seven, but this is difficult when AIDS kills many children before age five.    Still to be resolved is the question of using placebos, dummy drugs given for scientific purposes in controlled studies. Dr. Oleske argues that there may be instances in which placebos should be used because &quot;more children will benefit, and less will die, if we use appropriate drugs than if we guess.&quot; But Dr. Pizzo maintains that although the use of placebos may be justified in infected but healthy children, &quot;placebo-controlled trials in sick children are inappropriate.&quot;    Even after the best medical care, taking children home brings new problems. Mrs. Fried is a firm believer in home care, having tended her son Zack and administered intravenous feedings so that the five year old could remain in his own room among his toy trains. This enhanced his life &quot;to the last minute,&quot; she says, and hospitals and insurers should support home care.    In Newark, Dr. Oleske says, it has even been possible to train infected and sick mothers to keep children at home &quot;with no disasters.&quot; More troublesome is Medicaid -- the federal health-care system for the poor that now covers 90% of Dr. Oleske's children with AIDS. It pays for a hospital visit but not for home and hospice care.    The Department of Health and Human Services has established a working group to find ways to &quot;remove hindrances to payment and care&quot; of AIDS children by August. In addition to Medicaid restrictions, critics say, one such hindrance is the social-services bureaucracy, which too often blocks finding good foster care for AIDS waifs.    From her farm in Head Waters, Va., Dr. Kubler-Ross tries to match AIDS babies with willing families. &quot;These babies need to be in homes with gardens and butterflies, not group homes or pediatric units where they can't bond,&quot; she says. &quot;I have 27 homes willing and able, but we're drowning in red tape.&quot;    And the Starcross Community was still negotiating for custody of an AIDS baby last month when it learned that the baby, lost in a blizzard of paper work, had died in November. </TEXT></DOC>
