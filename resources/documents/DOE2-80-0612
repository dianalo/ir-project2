If they are of the Higgs field type,scalar fields offer a possibility to understand why the cosmologicalconstant is such a small quantity. This is because of the fact that differentground states are possible for a Higgs field. The unstable ground stategives an inflationary stage of the cosmic evolution and a large cosmologicalconstant whereas the stable ground state has a vanishing cosmologicalconstant and is decisive for the late time behaviour with an Einstein-DeSitter - like expansion law.</TEXT></DOC>
