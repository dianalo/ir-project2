(product introduction).andO;Product:   Metamorphosis 1.5 (Utility program) (product introduction).andO;Topic:     Page Description LanguagesFontsData ConversionProduct Introduction.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Altsys, the developer of Fontographer, has released an upgrade toMetamorphosis, a program that converts &quot;all existing PostScript fonts&quot; inAdobe's Type 3 format into Type 1 format and vice versa.andP;  Metamorphosisgenerates outlines that can be read by Adobe Type Manager (ATM), whichrenders more type more legibly on a Mac screen than the built-in font scalerApple supplies with every Macintosh computer.andM;In addition to converting fonts between Type 3 and Type 1, Metamorphosisgenerates Fontographer database format (which can also be read by several ofFontographer's  competitors) and generates outlines as EncapsulatedPostScript line art.andP;  The latter feature is now also offered in AdobeIllustrator 3.0.andM;There are three significant changes in the new release.andP;  First, Altsys is nowautomatically adding hints to unlimited Type 3 fonts as they are converted.andO;Its technology for doing so is called JimbusQ, a play on words between JimVon Ehr (founder and president of Altsys) and Nimbus-Q, the font technologydeveloped by The Company (the U.S.andP;  distributor for URW that was recentlyacquired by LaserMaster).andP;  Metamorphosis uses Von Ehr's own technology fordeciding where to put the hints, and then uses Nimbus-Q to insert them inType I format.andM;Second, Metamorphosis now converts fonts no matter where they reside:computer hard disk, floppy disk, printer hard disk or burned into printerRom.andP;  In its initial version, Metamorphosis would only convert fonts thatresided on or were downloaded to a printer.andP;  Third, Altsys is selling so manycopies of the program that in two months it has already recouped itsdevelopment costs.andP;  It has cut the price of the product by $146, from $295 to$149.andM;Metamorphosis is the second such converter that we've heard about.andP;  InFebruary, Image Club Graphics announced Evolution, a similar package, for $99(Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  7).andP;  Evolution is scheduled to be shipped in the next fewweeks.andP;  It, however, does not add hints.andP;  Greg Barry, developer of Evolution,believes that Adobe's recently improved rasterizers make hints less necessaryin Type 1 fonts.andM;Shortly after its announcement, Altsys reached a deal with LaserMasterwhereby LaserMaster's European distributors will be bundling Metamorphosiswith LaserMaster printers.andM;Fontographer upgrade.andP;  Altsys is now shipping version 3.1 of its Fontographertype creation and enhancement software for the Macintosh.andP;  Fontographer 3.1'snew features include the ability to create and work with Type 1 PostScriptfonts; improved automatic font hinting; kerning table editing for AFM andbitmap font files; and better autotracing of PICT images.andM;Pricing is $30 as an upgrade from Fontographer 3.0; $100 as an upgrade fromearlier versions; or $495 for new users.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
