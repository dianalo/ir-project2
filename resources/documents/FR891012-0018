The newlegislation made substantive changes to the laws governing the recordationof instruments. The Coast Guard's existing regulations are at variancewith some of those changes, and therefore must be amended to implementlegislative intent. The intended effect of this rulemaking is to conformthe Coast Guard's regulations to those aspects of the new statute whichare considered unequivocal and are currently effective, and to providefor uniform application of the law by the Coast Guard's Vessel DocumentationOffices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>dates: </T2>This interim final rule is effective October 12, 1989.Comments must be received by December 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>addresses: </T2>Comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary,Marine Safety Council (G-LRA-2/3600) (CGD 89-008), U.S. Coast Guard, 2100Second Street, SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b),the Coast Guard finds that notice and opportunity for comment are unnecessaryand contrary to the public interest. This rulemaking merely implementsnew statutory requirements affecting the filing and recordation of variouscommercial instruments related to vessels. Because this rulemaking merelyimplements the statutory changes already in effect, the Coast Guard hasdetermined that good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) for making thisrulemaking effective in less than 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal persons involved in drafting this rulemaking are Mr. ThomasL. Willis, Project Manager, and Lieutenant Commander Don M. Wrye, ProjectCounsel, Office of Chief Counsel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On November 23, 1988, Congress enacted Public Law 100-710 (``the Act''),which amended and codified the Ship Mortgage Act of 1920 into 46 U.S.C.Chapter 313. The Act introduced significant changes which are at variancewith the former law and with existing Coast Guard regulations.Most of the provisions of the Act which require changes to the Coast Guard'sregulations became effective on January 1, 1989. Certain of the changesare unequivocal and are being implemented in final form by this rulemaking.Other changes, some of which became effective on January 1, 1989, and otherswhich will become effective on January 1, 1990, require a more consideredapproach, including the opportunity for public comment. These latter changeswill be the subject of separate rulemaking action.This interim final rule, which is effective upon publication, is intendedto minimize transitional uncertainty, while permitting an opportunity forpublic comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Regulation</ITAG>Every section in subparts 67.29, 67.31, 67.33, 67.35, 67.37, and 67.39is revised to provide for the filing of instruments.Section 67.01 is amended to add definitions of Secretary and acknowledgment.Section 67.17-3(c) is a new section added to provide for loss of registryprivileges during any period when the vessel is mortgaged to a person otherthan a State, the United States Government, a federally insured depositoryinstitution which has not been disapproved by the Secretary, an individualwho is a citizen of the United States, a person qualifying as a citizenof the United States under Section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C.App. 802), or other person approved by the Secretary of Transportation.Sections 67.17-5(d) and 67.17-7(d) are amended to provide for loss of coastwiseand Great Lakes license privileges during any period when the vessel ismortgaged to a person other than a State, the United States Government,a federally insured depository institution which has not been disapprovedby the Secretary, an individual who is a citizen of the United States,a person qualifying as a citizen of the United States under Section 2 ofthe Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. App. 802), or other person approved bythe Secretary of Transportation.Section 67.23-1(a) is amended to reflect the fact that the license(s) endorsedupon the Certificate must be renewed annually, even though the Certificateof Documentation remains valid until surrendered with the consent of theSecretary.Section 67.23-3(b) is removed. Section 67.23-5 is amended to reflect thenew statutory requirement for consent by a chattel mortgagee prior to surrenderof a Certificate of Documentation under certain circumstances. This isa change from the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920, which provided for such consentonly for preferred mortgages.Section 67.23-9(c) is amended to reflect the fact that a Certificate ofDocumentation which is subject to deletion remains valid for purposes ofsections 9 and 37(b) of the Shipping Act, 1916, section 902 of the MerchantMarine Act, 1920, instruments filed or recorded before the date of invalidation,and assignments filed after that date.Section 67.23-11(c) is amended to reflect the fact that a Certificate ofDocumentation subject to cancellation remains valid for purposes of sections9 and 37(b) of the Shipping Act, 1916, Section 902 of the Merchant MarineAct, 1920, instruments filed or recorded before the date of invalidation,and assignments filed after that date.Section 67.25-3 is amended to reflect the new requirement for consent ofa chattel mortgagee before the name of a vessel may be changed.Section 67.29-1 is amended to eliminate the reference to Abstracts of Titleas recordable instruments.Section 67.29-3 is amended to reflect the changes made to section 9 ofthe Shipping Act, 1916, eliminating the need for approval of the Secretaryof Transportation to permit transfers of fishing industry vessels and recreationalvessels to persons who are not citizens of the United States.Section 67.29-5 is amended to clarify the requirements for identificationof vessels specified in recorded instruments. The section is further amendedto provide that all instruments, not merely bills of sale or deeds of gift,covering vessels not previously documented may identify the vessel by somemeans other than name and official number.Section 67.29-7 is amended to eliminate the reference to Abstracts of Titleas recorded instruments.Section 67.27-11 is amended to clarify the requirement for declarationsabout citizenship precedent to filing and recordation. It also specifiesthe instruments to which the requirement applies.Section 67.29-13 specifies the place(s) for filing and recordation. Itmakes clear that while filing in connection with either the initial documentationof a vessel or any transaction which brings about a change in documentationmay be made at a documentation office in a port other than the vessel'shome port, all recordation is done by the documentation office at the homeport of the vessel.Section 67.29-15 is amended to reflect the fact that an instrument is recordableif it is in substantial compliance with applicable requirements.Section 67.29-17 is a new section. All instruments are considered to befiled upon receipt. Although filed, some instruments may not be recorded,either because recordation depends upon documentation or the instrumentis determined not to be in substantial compliance with the applicable regulationsand statutes. In such cases, the filing must be terminated. This sectionsets forth when filing will be deemed terminated, and the disposition ofthe instruments upon termination of filing.Section 67.31-1 is amended by eliminating the requirement for a declarationof citizenship which is now set forth in andSection; 67.29-11 of this part.Section 67.31-5 is amended to state the requirement to include the addressesof parties to instruments submitted for filing and recordation.Section 67.33-1 is amended by eliminating the requirement for a declarationof citizenship which is now set forth in andSection; 67.29-11 of this part.Section 67.33-5 is amended to state the requirement to include the addressesof parties to instruments submitted for filing and recordation. In addition,the requirement to state the interest in the vessel held by each mortgagee,a requirement which is not found in law, is eliminated. Paragraph (c) ofthis section is amended by eliminating the requirement for a maturity date,and by adopting language to permit the statement of the amount of mortgagein one or more units of account.Section 67.33-11 is amended to state the requirement to include the addressesof parties to instruments submitted for filing and recordation.Section 67.33-13 is amended to eliminate the requirement that the assumingparty hold legal title to the vessel covered by the assumption at the timeof execution and filing of the assumption.Section 67.33-17 is amended to state the requirement to include the addressesof parties to instruments submitted for filing and recordation.Section 67.33-23 is amended to state the requirement to include the addressesof parties to instruments submitted for filing and recordation.Sections 67.33-25, 67.33-27, and 67.33-29 are new sections describing thegeneral requirements, required signatures, and required recitations, respectively,for agreements subordinating chattel mortgages.Subpart 67.35 is being revised to include filing and recordation informationfor preferred mortgages and related instruments. Generally, the revisioneliminates the following: (1) Reference to endorsement and the requirementfor presentation of the Certificate of Documentation for endorsement ofthe mortgage; (2) the requirement that the vessel covered by the mortgagebe documented at the time the mortgage is made; (3) the requirement foran affidavit of good faith; (4) the requirement that a mortgage coveringa vessel of less than twenty-five (25) gross tons be accompanied by a statementthat the vessel is not a towboat, barge, scow, lighter, car float, canalboat or tank vessel; and (5) the requirement that a mortgage securing propertyin addition to a vessel identify that other property and provide for separatedischarge of that property.Section 67.35-3 eliminates the restriction against recordation of a preferredmortgage if it contains language which constitutes a waiver of its preferredstatus. The restriction against recording as preferred a mortgage on avessel to a person other than a citizen of the United States as definedin 46 U.S.C. App. 802 has been clarified to reflect the long-standing policyof also recording qualified preferred mortgages which have as the mortgageea State, the United States Government, or an individual who is a citizenof the United States. In addition, that same restriction has been modifiedto permit recording of preferred mortgages if the mortgagee is a federallyinsured depository institution which has not been disapproved by the Secretaryof Transportation, even if that institution is not a citizen as definedin 46 U.S.C. App. 802. The Secretary of Transportation may also approveany other person as a preferred mortgagee. The responsibility for disapprovalof financial institutions or approval of other persons as preferred mortgageesis within the purview of the Maritime Administration which administersthe provisions of Section 9 of the Shipping Act of 1916. The section alsostates that the restrictions against certain persons holding preferredmortgages do not apply to a vessel which has been operated only as fishing,fish processing, or fish tender vessel, or for pleasure. Section 67.35-7 provides for filing and recordation of instruments subordinatingor waiving the preferred status of the mortgage. Section 67.35-9 reflects the new provisions of andSection; 67.35-3 describingpersons permitted to be preferred mortgagees and eliminates the prohibitionagainst language which would constitute a waiver of preferred status. Subpart 67.37 is revised to include information concerning filing and recordationof notices of claim of lien. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures </ITAG>These regulations are considered to be non-major under Executive Order12291 and nonsignificant under the DOT regulatory procedures (44 FR 11034;February 26, 1979). The economic impact of this regulation has been foundto be so minimal that further evaluation is unnecessary. The regulationmerely provides for filing of instruments and simplifies perfection ofliens against documented vessels. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>Since the impact of this regulation is expected to be minimal, the agencycertifies that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Although a substantial number of small entitiesare involved in vessel operations within the ambit of this regulation,the provisions of this regulation simplify the requirements for complianceand reduce the possibility of rejection of instruments submitted for filingand recordation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This rulemaking imposes no new paperwork burden on the public. It reducesthe number of types of instruments which must accompany instruments submittedfor filing and recordation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact </ITAG>This rulemaking has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and determinedto be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation inaccordance with Section 2-B-3.h. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B.
