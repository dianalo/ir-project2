The company said it will take a charge in the fourth quarter of about $250,000 as a result of the layoffs.    In addition, a spokesman for the maker and marketer of data-storage products for desktop computers said December is usually a strong month for Iomega and predicted that revenue would rise slightly for the quarter. But he said price increases earlier this year would contribute to a &quot;considerable&quot; decline in profit from the year-earlier quarter's net income of $5.1 million, or 33 cents a share. The result included a $2.4 million tax credit, on sales of $33.5 million.    The spokesman said the layoffs are necessary because &quot;we have tried just about everything possible to reduce our costs . . . and improve our competitiveness.&quot; He said no further layoffs are planned.    Iomega said 130 of the dismissals will come from the managerial ranks at its Roy, Utah, manufacturing plant. The rest will come from other facilities.    Dismissed employees will receive a severance package including four weeks' pay for workers at Iomega more than two years, three weeks' pay for those at the company fewer than two years, and extended health insurance benefits, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
