Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain will make theopening speech and argue against stronger sanctions or a deadlinefor reform in South Africa, which quit the Commonwealth in 1961.   The African National Congress, the main group fighting whitedomination in South Afrida, urged the Commonwealth to impose moresanctions and indicated its hit-and-run guerrilla attacks maychange.   ``It is very important ... to pay attention to the question ofbuilding up the military capacity to conduct a sustained armedstruggle, not merely to carry out an operation once in a while,however spectacular,'' said Thabo Mbeki, the organization'sspokesman on foreign affairs.   Mrs. Thatcher is likely to dominate the 40th anniversary summitas she has in the past.   Many delegates said they were prepared to give South Africa'snew president, F.W. de Klerk, six months to deliver on promises ofradical reforms following Sunday's release of several leading blacknationalists.   British officials said Mrs. Thatcher felt a deadline would be``wholly artificial.''   ``You're not going to solve the South African question in sixmonths. It's going to take some time,'' one said.   Commonwealth countries have led the push for internationalaction against apartheid, South Africa's official policy of racialsegregation.   Britain says recent progress toward political settlements inNamibia, Angola and Mozambique should not be jeopardized by forcingSouth Africa into a corner.   ``The way forward is not to set it back and not to put artificaldeadlines upon people,'' the official said. ``You must allow thereform process to go forward to prove its worth.''   Sir Shridath Ramphal, Commonwealth secretary-general, indicatedin a briefing before Mrs. Thatcher's arrival that environmentalissues might eclipse the South Africa question. He saidenvironmental problems were of such wide concern, ``it could be insome respects a crisis agenda.''   After her arrival and meetings of British officials with otherdelegations, however, it became clear Mrs. Thatcher wanted SouthAfrica at the top of the list for the conference in the Putra WorldTrade Center on the Klang River.   The summit, which does not take formal votes on issues, runsuntil Oct. 24.</TEXT></DOC>
