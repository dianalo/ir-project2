A significant excessof lung cancer was proven in exposure categories below 50 WLM, the firstsignificant excess of lung cancer rate was found in the sixth year followingthe start of exposure, and a significant difference between the observedand expected rate was found in miners even before the fortieth year ofage. The mean attributable annual cancer risk after about 30 y of observationin the whole study was approximately 20.0 and in persons starting exposureafter 30 y of age the risk was approximately 30.0 per year per 1 WLMper 10(6) persons. The dose-effect relationship and the attributablelung cancer risk per 1 WLM were significantly influenced by the age atthe first exposure by total accumulated exposure and by the characterof the accumulation of exposure. The observed effects of smoking andexposure to alpha radiation from Rn daughters were nearly additive. Thelung cancer risk per 1 WLM at low levels of exposure (not including thecontribution from natural sources in the living environment) in U aswell as Fe mines indicated a certain elevation compared with the riskat higher accumulated exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
