Sakharov has appealed for Western Europe'shelp in freeing 11 of Armenian nationalist leaders who Sovietauthorities have imprisoned, Socialist Party officials said.   The Soviet human rights activist met Tuesday with Socialistleader and former Premier Bettino Craxi.   Sakharov, a physicist and winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize,is in Italy to accept academic and civic honors in his secondforeign trip since being freed from seven years of internal exile in1986.   Sakharov told Craxi ``something absolutely needs to be done'' byWestern Europe to free members of the Karabakh Committee, accordingto Margherita Boniver, a parliamentarian and the Socialists' foreignrelations spokeswoman.   All 11 committee members were arrested in December for allegedlyfanning ethnic tensions in the southern Soviet republic of Armeniabut have not been formally charged.   The committee has spearheaded a campaign by Armenians to gaincontrol of Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly Armenian enclave of theneighboring republic of Azerbaijan.   Clashes between Armenians, most of whom are Christian, andAzerbaijanis, who are predominantly Moslem, broke out last year inthe two republics over the Armenian demands for annexation ofNagorno-Karabakh.   In Moscow on Tuesday, a Soviet official released the highestestimates yet of the human toll in the unrest. Maj. Gen. NikolaiVasko of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said 91 people were killedand injured 1,650 in last year's ethnic violence, the official Tassnews agency reported.   The rioting so terrified Armenians and Azerbaijanis living ineach other's republics that nearly 300,000 fled their homes, Tassquoted him as saying.   Less than a sixth of the refugees have since returned home,according to Vasko. Previous reports had placed the death toll fromthe violence at more than 70, with 200,000 refugees.   Sakharov called the imprisonment of the Karabakh committeemembers ``a step backward in view of the decision made in Vienna''last month, at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,to organize a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991, Mrs.Boniver told The Associated Press.   The two also discussed this spring's Soviet parliamentaryelections, in which Sakharov is a candidate, and the new forces ofdemocratization and economic modernization in the Soviet Union, aSocialist Party statement said.   Sakharov later met with top Italian scientists and thanked themfor helping improve the plight of Soviet dissidents, the Italiannews agency ANSA reported. He also cautioned the scientists abouttheir responsibilities for ``the dangers of global nature that canderive from science, like those of nuclear war or ecologicaldisaster,'' ANSA said.</TEXT></DOC>
