It was one of thebiggest anti-apartheid rallies ever in London.   Against a backdrop of flags of the African National Congress,South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu led the rally in chants thatechoed across central London.   ``In 25 years in jail, he (Mandela) has not spoken to thepublic, yet many people not born then have been inspired by him,''declared Tutu.   ``This man is head and shoulders above any contemporary leaderin South Africa,'' Tutu said. ``Any sensible government wouldrealize that Nelson Mandela is absolutely essential for peace andstability in southern Africa.''   Mandela turns 70 on Monday. He was jailed in 1962 for leavingSouth Africa illegally and inciting unrest. While serving afive-year sentence, he was given a life term in 1964 for sabotageand plotting the overthrow of the government.   South Africa's white-led government banned all major birthdaycelebrations for Mandela, whose ANC guerrilla movement is outlawedthere.   Organizers arranged a last-minute concert Sunday at theUniversity of Cape Town, but police stopped it about two hoursafter it began. The audience of 500 left peacefully.   Dozens of foreign governments called for Mandela's release inrecent days.   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Mandela, ``It distressesone to realize that you mark the birthday in a prison dungeon intowhich you were thrown by the racists more than a quarter of acentury ago.''   ``Soviet people firmly demand your release, Comrade Mandela, andthe release of all political prisoners in the Republic of SouthAfrica,'' Gorbachev said in a telegram Sunday, which was publishedby the official Tass news agency. ``I give you a strong handshake.''   In Italy, thousands jammed piazzas for a Saturday night concertin Bologna and another one Sunday in Rome. Dutch and Swedishanti-apartheid movements scheduled events for Monday.   In central London, traffic was snarled as the demonstrators,headed by 25 activists who had marched 500 miles from Glasgow,Scotland, poured into Hyde Park under rainy skies.   The organizers, Britain's Anti-Apartheid Movement, estimated thecrowd at 250,000 people, but police put the figure at only 30,000.Scotland Yard reported three arrests on minor offenses.   The mostly young, white crowd swayed as a South African bandbelted out African nationalist themes from the podium, which wasringed with red and black tribal warrior shields.   They roared with approval as the face of Winnie Mandela, thejailed leader's wife, flashed on a giant video screen. In a messagetaped in South Africa, she said her husband's birthday ``relates toa symbol of resistance in this country.''   ``We are very moved, very touched, by this gesture,'' she said,expressing thanks ``to the entire international community'' forapplying pressure for her husband's release.   Security forces, some in armored vehicles, patrolled SouthAfrica's major black townships Sunday, although there were noreports of violence. Police also set up several roadblocks,including one outside Cape Town's Pollsmoor Prison where Mandela isheld.   Six other purple-robed bishops, in Britain for the LambethConference of Anglican bishops held every 10 years, joined Tutu onthe podium.   They sat with labor union activists, opposition Labor Partymembers of Parliament, Commonwealth Secretary General Sir ShridathRamphal and Sir Richard Attenborough, whose film on South Africa,``Cry Freedom,'' has attracted huge audiences.   The crowd cheered as speakers denounced Western leaders,particularly British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for refusingto impose tough economic sanctions against South Africa.   Mandela has refused an offer of release by the South Africangovernment on the condition he renounces violence, saying that thereal prepetrators of violence are South African authorities.   South African diplomat Justus de Goede, the second-rankingofficial at the London Embassy, said in a radio interview the ANCwas committed to the violent overthrow of the government, and notedthat bomb and grenade attacks by ANC guerrillas were increasing.   ``I think it is asking a great deal of any government toknowingly release the leader of an organization which has thispolitical manifesto into society without some sort of guarantee,''de Goede said.   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting South Africa'sgovernment and its system of apartheid, under which the country's26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5 millionwhites control the economy and maintain separate schools anddistricts.   In addition to Gorbachev, West German Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahahir Mohamadand Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen all called Sundayfor Mandela's release.</TEXT></DOC>
