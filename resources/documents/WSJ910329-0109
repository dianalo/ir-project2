The controversy stems from Hong Kong's port and airportdevelopment plan, estimated at one time to cost 127 billionHong Kong dollars (US$16.3 billion). Given the colony'sscheduled 1997 return to Chinese rule, getting the privatesector to put up as much as 60% of the funds for such a hugeundertaking -- as the government initially envisioned --isn't easy without China's endorsement.</LP><TEXT>   But after months of lower-level Sino-British exchangesthat alternated between verbal insults and conciliatorygestures, Beijing has continued to balk. Mr. Hurd's trip isthus widely regarded as a last chance to produce acompromise.   While the diplomatic signals remain mixed, local businesspeople seem perplexed by the drawn-out feud and divided onthe prospects for Mr. Hurd's visit.   Many people, arguing that neither side wants such ahigh-level visit to end in failure, are betting oncompromise. &quot;This visit would not take place if China andBritain don't see a realistic chance that something will comeof it. I just hope that whatever concessions are made toChina don't go too far,&quot; says J.D. McGregor, a prominentbusinessman and member of the colony's Legislative Council.   Others say they aren't so sure. &quot;I hope that it can besolved. But it certainly shouldn't be a foregone conclusion&quot;that Mr. Hurd will secure an acceptable compromise, saysHelmut Sohmen, chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber ofCommerce and of World-Wide Shipping Agency Ltd., a big localshipping concern.   Mr. Hurd's visit would make him the highest-rankingBritish emissary to visit Beijing since 1989, when a brutalcrackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in the Chinesecapital strained China's ties with Britain and other Westerngovernments. A breakdown in the talks could set back effortsto mend that rift as well as severely harm public confidencein this territory's political future.   Mr. Hurd could land Hong Kong in a dilemma if he comesaway empty-handed. That would all but rule out private-sectorfinancing and force the colonial government to choose betweenscrapping the project and doing it piecemeal. The piecemealapproach wouldn't be easy, because the estimated cost of theplan's core element, which is the airport minus the port,already exceeds Hong Kong's accumulated fiscal reserves ofabout HK$72 billion. But the alternative, abandoning theplan, would leave Hong Kong stuck with congested Kai TakInternational Airport.   &quot;If China's position proves intractable, the Hong Konggovernment can't leave the project on the back burnerforever,&quot; says Mr. Sohmen. &quot;At some point, it would have todecide whether it can pluck away on its own or just walkaway.&quot;   Such a relatively pessimistic scenario precludeslast-minute softenings in the positions taken by Britain orChina, or both. Convinced that Britain is determined toimprove ties with China on geopolitical and perhapscommercial grounds, many people predict that Mr. Hurd willprove reasonably &quot;flexible&quot; on Hong Kong-related questions.Another view has it that Beijing, having just begun to emergefrom diplomatic isolation, wouldn't want to take the airportcontroversy too far.   Mr. Hurd has given little public indication of hisintentions. Speaking to reporters this week, he saidpotential topics will include China's human-rights situationand a range of Hong Kong-related issues. He is due to be inChina from Wednesday until April 8 to hold talks with anumber of government leaders, including possibly Premier LiPeng. That visit is to be bracketed by two stops in HongKong.   To some extent, the controversy over the airport plan isof the Hong Kong government's own making. Though a newairport had long been contemplated, the plan was hastilypackaged with other projects and announced as one grand planin October 1989. The idea then was to boost public confidencein Hong Kong's future, which had been shaken by Beijing'scrackdown in June that year.   In its haste, the colonial administration evidently failedto consider in detail how it might meet the project's bigbills. That omission was compounded by a failure to informBeijing, which irritated Chinese officials and caused them tosuspect that Britain might be using the project as a ploy todrain Hong Kong of its fiscal reserves. By the time Hong Kongrealized it might not be able to proceed without Beijing'sendorsement, what started as a big construction project hadturned into a fullblown diplomatic feud.   The rhetoric only cooled two months ago when Sir DavidWilson, the colony's governor, called on Premier Li,apparently to offer a detailed accounting as well asassurances that China would be consulted on major Hong Kongdecisions in the future. The government also began to playdown the grandness of the plan by referring to the airportand port proposals individually. Various suggestions alsowere made to trim the projects' costs. But while theembarrassing retreat enabled negotiations with China to beginin earnest, it also seems to have emboldened China in itsdemands for concessions from Hong Kong.   Broadly speaking, Beijing has indicated that it mayendorse the development plan if it can secure a degree ofpolitical control over the project and perhaps other aspectsof the colony's affairs. More specifically, it wants a rightof veto over the project at every stage. It also wantsBritain to guarantee that Hong Kong's fiscal reserves willstand at a specified minimum on July 1, 1997, the date of thesovereignty transfer.   Mr. McGregor belittles the fiscal guarantee as &quot;a sillyidea.&quot; But a more fundamental objection to all these demandsis that they don't seem to fit the Sino-British JointDeclaration, the agreement ratified in 1985 as a guide tocarrying out the sovereignty transfer.   The document states that until 1997, Britain &quot;will beresponsible for the administration of Hong Kong&quot; and thatBeijing should be consulted on major issues. The documentsays nothing about Beijing actually sharing Britain'sresponsibility at any time before 1997, as it currently seemsto want to do.</TEXT></DOC>
