But the state's voters could soon order a radical change of course.    A citizen's initiative prepared by U.S. Rep. William Dannemeyer, a conservative Orange County Republican, and by Whittier radiologist Lawrence McNamee is promoting passage of a law requiring that doctors report patients or blood donors with positive AIDS-test results to state health officials or be fined $250.    The proposed law, to be voted on in November, would also require that anyone known or &quot;reasonably believed&quot; by doctors or health authorities to be infected with AIDS must divulge a list of intimate partners to the state or be charged with a misdemeanor.    Just as California's Proposition 13 stimulated a tax-revolt movement around the country a decade ago, the enactment of Proposition 102 could have considerable nationwide influence. That enactment is a distinct possibility. Although California voters have twice rejected AIDS quarantine measures offered by right-wing extremist Lyndon LaRouche, findings of the California Poll indicate they currently favor Proposition 102's core provisions -- reporting and contact-tracing -- by 58%, with 31% opposed and 11% undecided.    Proposition 102, however, has other far-reaching provisions. It would permit use of the AIDS antibody test by insurers and employers and would allow doctors to use the same test on a patient's blood without the patient's written consent. It would make willful transmission of the virus a crime and would stiffen sentences for rape or assault by AIDS-virus carriers.    The measure, if passed and upheld in court, would make the nation's most populous state a leader in a legal counter-trend toward favoring alleged public interests and the needs of employers and insurers over patients' rights. No states have passed laws as sweepingly restrictive as the California proposal; indeed, the initiative's allowance of pre-employment testing runs counter to current trends toward &quot;more states passing protective laws,&quot; says Dick Merritt, director of the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.    Only two elements of Proposition 102 are in step with new trends: its loosening of strictures on medical information and its tightening of penalties for knowingly infecting others. Releasing information on a need-to-know basis to public servants -- for example to firefighters and paramedics -- is gaining currency, although only two or three states have devoted special statutes dealing specifically with the AIDS virus and information release. About 10 states have declared willful transmission a felony, with Louisiana setting the strictest standard. But Mr. Merritt cautions: &quot;These things are very difficult to adjudicate.&quot;    Currently, all states by law require diagnosed AIDS cases to be reported to state and federal health agencies. But only a quarter of states ask doctors to report to health authorities when patients simply test positive for AIDS antibodies. The incubation period for AIDS infection, when those infected with the virus are often outwardly healthy though infectious, can last up to 12 years before illness develops.    The possibility of a seemingly healthy AIDS carrier infecting others warrants Proposition 102's reporting provisions, Rep. Dannemeyer argues. &quot;We citizens have rights,&quot; he says, &quot;but we also have a duty to know our own status and to avoid transferring a disease to another human being.&quot; Dr. McNamee, the co-author of the initiative, declares concern for civil liberties &quot;has wrested control of this disease away from public-health officials and placed it the hands of infected people.&quot;    Lending his name -- and added emotional charge -- to the campaign for passing the initiative is Paul Gann, father of the Proposition 13 tax revolt. Today, Mr. Gann is an AIDS patient, having contracted the disease from tainted transfusions during heart surgery. He is speaking out, he says, &quot;for my kids and grandkids.&quot; His message: &quot;No one can say that you or I have a civil right to spread a virus.&quot;    But such arguments don't sway most of the state's medical establishment. Laurens White, president of the California Medical Association, the state branch of the American Medical Association, castigates Proposition 102 as &quot;bad law and bad medicine&quot; promoted by &quot;a bunch of right-wing, anti-homosexual activists.&quot; Dr. White and AIDS experts such as Paul Volberding, a physician and head of the AIDS unit at San Francisco General Hospital, warn that the proposition's passage would drive patients underground, thus discouraging their participation in critical AIDS research, and would destroy blood banking through the fear of exposure. Moreover, Dr. White charges the measure's language about reporting persons &quot;believed&quot; infected invites witch hunts.    &quot;If a guy is wearing jeans and boots and is walking on upper Market Street, you may have reasonable belief he is infected,&quot; he says.    Other opponents include the California Nurses Association and the American Civil Liberties Union. Most recently, the California Chamber of Commerce has come out against the Dannemeyer initiative, as have such companies as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., Apple Computer Inc., Burroughs Wellcome Co. (maker of anti-AIDS drug AZT), Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. and Levi Strauss andamp; Co. The companies cite reasons ranging from humanitarian concerns to the belief that the proposed law would be counterproductive in the fight against AIDS. Economists at the University of California at Berkeley warn that in the first year alone the measure will cost $1.75 billion to enforce.    Proposition 102 partly represents a backlash against state policies viewed by some voters as overly restrictive, such as the ban on tests by insurers and the stringent confidentiality measures. A doctor referring a patient for surgery, for example, is currently forbidden to tell the surgeon if the patient is infected.    Notwithstanding threats of a $10,000 fine, medical workers flout the law to inform their colleagues, Dr. White says. &quot;Doctors were upset because information couldn't be shared within the medical loop,&quot; he adds. (State legislators recently passed a bill easing the restriction. If signed by the governor, it would render part of the initiative moot.)    But whatever the reasons underlying the initiative, the gay community regards Proposition 102 as &quot;a nightmare . . . LaRouche in sheep's clothing,&quot; says Benjamin Schatz, a San Francisco attorney with National Gay Rights Advocates. His group together with the ACLU lost a court fight to remove Proposition 102 from the ballot. If the proposition carries, the group is braced to renew its legal battle on the ground that the wide-ranging measure violates a law limiting citizen initiatives to a single subject.    Mr. Schatz raises the specter of what he calls &quot;sexual McCarthyism,&quot; a political climate in which privacy could be invaded and rights revoked on the basis of a false report of infection or sexual association. &quot;If this thing passes, it will be a disaster,&quot; he predicts. &quot;It will be open season on gays . . . We'll have packages like this all across the country.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
