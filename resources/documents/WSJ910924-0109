The decision affirmed the right of insurers to writepolicies for directors and officers that exclude coverage forliability stemming from lawsuits by federal regulators. Whiledirectors and officers at failed banks and savings and loanscan be held personally liable in such suits, insurancecarriers' so-called regulatory exclusion leaves theindividuals without insurance to cover their losses.</LP><TEXT>   The decision, the first by a federal appellate court toaddress the issue, was a blow to the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., which had sought to create a precedent inits favor when it sued nine former directors and officers ofFarmers National Bank of Aurelia, Iowa, in 1985 after thebank collapsed as a result of poor management. &quot;This case wasbeing relied on for a whole lot of other cases, and we neededto win this one,&quot; said an FDIC lawyer involved in the suit.   The FDIC sought to recover Farmers National's losses froma director-and-officer liability policy issued by AmericanCasualty Co. of Reading, Pa., a unit of CNA Insurance Cos. ofChicago, even though the policy contained the regulatoryexclusion. The legal question boiled down to whether theclause circumvented the FDIC's larger public-policy interestin recovering assets wherever possible -- and thereforeshould be voided. In similar cases, some lower courts haveheld that when private contractual rights of insurancecompanies conflict with a strong public interest, such asrecovering assets from failed financial institutions, thepublic's interest prevails.   But in a unanimous opinion, the Eighth U.S. Circuit Courtof Appeals in St. Louis rejected that view last week,upholding a U.S. District Court ruling in Sioux City, Iowa.&quot;We see no error of law or fact on the District Court'sanalysis and conclusions on these points,&quot; the appeals courtruled.   Virtually all financial institutions havedirector-and-officer liability insurance. Exclusion clausesbegan being written into the policies in the mid-1980s inanticipation of the current banking and Sandamp;L crisis, saidDavid Gische, an attorney with the Washington law firm ofRoss, Dixon andamp; Masback who represented American Casualty.About 75% of all director-and-officer laibility policies atfinancial institutions now contain the proviso, said StephenSills, president of the executive risk division at Aetna Lifeandamp; Casualty Co.   Lawyers for the insurance industry argued that Congresscould have declared a public-policy interest against the useof the exclusion clause in such policies -- but chose not to-- when it enacted the Financial Institutions Reform,Recovery and Enforcement Act in 1979. The FDIC, in a reportto Congress filed last week, asks for just such &quot;correctivelegislation.&quot;   ---   DENNIS LEVINE attracts interest of federal investigators,producer says.   Mr. Levine, the Wall Street felon currently on abook-publicity tour, is getting more attention than hebargained for. Federal investigators have taken interest incertain dealings that Mr. Levine has had since his 1988release from prison, according to a person who has beencontacted by the investigators.   The dealings were described on CBS TV's &quot;60 Minutes&quot;program on Sunday, on which Mr. Levine appeared as part of atour to promote his new book about the insider-tradingscandals.   According to the CBS program, Mr. Levine, among otherthings, introduced two clients, who were looking forreal-estate financing, to a convict he met in prison, withouttelling the clients of the man's background. After theprogram aired, both the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattanand U.S. postal inspectors contacted a CBS producer, askingquestions about Mr. Levine, the producer said. They'relooking into whether Mr. Levine committed any violations ofsecurities laws governing investment advisers.   The focus on his current business dealings has apparentlycaught Mr. Levine by surprise. Yesterday, in an interviewwith Wall Street Journal Television, Mr. Levine said he sawnothing wrong with introducing his clients to James Massaro,whom the clients later learned served at the same prison withMr. Levine.   Mr. Levine said that the clients weren't concerned withMr. Massaro's background, and that in any case Mr. Massarowasn't acting as a lender.   People who leave prison shouldn't be constantly remindedof their crimes, Mr. Levine reasoned. &quot;The fact that he madea mistake in his life and was allowed to go forward withoutthe brand of `convicted felon,'&quot; said Mr. Levine in the WallStreet Journal TV interview, &quot;put me under no legal orfinancial responsibility to disclose his past mistakes.&quot;Pressed further, Mr. Levine added: &quot;The man is entitled toprivacy . . . . Everybody deserves a chance.&quot;   The CBS show also said that the two clients paid $65,825in upfront fees, on Mr. Levine's advice, in an attempt togain loans from a lender in Panama. They also paid Mr. Levinea $10,000 fee to advise them. The two men later learned thatthe man who ran the Panamanian company had been underinvestigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Thepair said that after the loan fell through, Mr. Levine alsoput them in contact with a convicted thief with ties toorganized crime.   Mr. Levine, a former executive at now-collapsed DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. and other major Wall Street securitiesfirms, served 17 months of a two-year prison sentence for hisrole in a massive insider-trading scandal that led to thedownfall of Ivan Boesky, Michael Milken and others. He sayshe is the president of a financial consulting firm in NewYork.</TEXT></DOC>
