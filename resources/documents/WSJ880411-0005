Chanos loves debt.    A company awash in debt warms his heart. If it is struggling to meet its interest payments, that's good. If its business is turning sour, that's great.    Mr. Chanos is a professional short seller, specializing in finding stocks that seem overvalued and making money if they drop. He has done a lot of both over the past year and fully expects his winning streak to continue.    Why? Stocks are &quot;still too expensive,&quot; he says. &quot;There's still no feeling of disgust toward equities. People are willing to believe -- that there will be a takeover, that the Japanese will buy you out of your problems, or whatever. At bear-market bottoms, people believe nothing.&quot;    For the 30-year-old Mr. Chanos, last October's crash was like being dealt a royal flush. Even though he was one of the best-known short sellers on Wall Street, money had only trickled into his hands after he left Deutsche Bank Capital Corp. and set up his own money-management firm in 1985. Now, he manages more than $30 million, triple the total a year ago. These days, he jokes, he takes the subway out of choice, not necessity.    A short seller borrows shares from a broker and immediately sells them. Eventually, he must buy the stock to replace the borrowed shares. If the stock declines substantially in the meantime, the short seller profits. Mr. Chanos and his clients profited by about 43% last year.    Thus, new clients have been attracted to his firm's private investment partnership, called Ursus Partners (Ursus is Latin for bear, Wall Street slang for someone who expects stock prices to drop). His clients are motivated by both greed and fear. Greed, because that 43% return looks alluring in a year that was close to flat for most money managers. Fear, because some investors want part of their money on the short side as a precaution against another stock-market plunge.    Mr. Chanos expects a deep decline -- not another sudden crash but a gradual erosion as a severe recession develops within a year or two. &quot;People don't have an understanding of how much leverage there is in corporate balance sheets,&quot; he says. &quot;A tiny slowdown in demand will wreak havoc on earnings.&quot;    Once the market has declined sufficiently, Mr. Chanos plans to change his mix, currently about four &quot;shorts&quot; for every &quot;long.&quot; (A long position is a conventional purchase, in which the investor hopes the stock's price will rise.) Right now, his main long is CBS Inc.; his major shorts include Compaq Computer Corp., Jiffy Lube International Inc., Integrated Resources Inc. and Ideal Basic Industries Inc. He won't reveal his other shorts, but they include two cable-television companies and a money-center bank.    When hunting for short-sale candidates, Mr. Chanos usually looks for two things: a full load of debt and a faded boom. If a company has plunged deep in hock to invest in a once-booming industry that is now beaten down or has gone bust, Mr. Chanos tags it as a strong short-sale candidate. A few years ago, that led him to short banks and real-estate companies in Texas.    Now, he is looking for ways to short New York real estate because he sees lingering problems in financial services. Nevertheless, he apparently expects to keep prospering. He and his wife are awaiting their first child -- and shopping for a weekend home in the Hamptons.
