But to Aldus and others, the so-called computer ``virus'' _apparently the first to appear in commercial software _ has causedconsternation.   Viruses are programs created by computer operators for secretinsertion into other programs as jokes or as acts of vandalism.They can spread from computer to computer when operators sharecontaminated software.   Consequences of the ``disease'' can range from a surprisemessage that pops up on a computer screen, as happened with theAldus virus, to the destruction of information stored in computermemories.   Until now, personal computer viruses were thought to reside onlyin non-commercial software, such as that available free or at lowcost on computerized bulletin boards or on software disks shared bycomputer users.   Experts had thought viruses could be avoided if users used onlycommercial, off-the-shelf programs.   Richard Brandow, publisher of Montreal-based MacMag,acknowledged Tuesday in an interview that he wrote the so-called``peace message'' that popped up on thousands of Apple Macintoshcomputer screens.   Brandow claimed that besides calling for world peace, the viruswas intended to discourage software piracy or unauthorized copyingand to encourage computer users to buy original copies.   The virus was discovered in FreeHand, a new program developed byAldus for Macintosh computers, said Aldus spokeswoman Laury Bryantsaid. The message flashed when the program was loaded in thecomputer, Ms. Bryant said.   Although it ``was a very benign incident,'' Aldus officials areangry and ``are talking with our attorneys to understand what ourlegal rights are in this instance,'' Ms. Bryant said.   ``We feel that Richard Brandow's actions deserve to be condemnedby every member of the Macintosh community,'' she said.   The incident resulted in Aldus having to recall or reworkthousands of packages of the new software. Ms. Bryant declined tosay how much the recall or reworking of software would cost.   The incident also sent a scare through the computer industry,because several of the nation's largest software companies also areclients of a MacroMind Inc. of Chicago, a subcontractor thatinadvertently spread the virus to Aldus.   MacroMind President Marc Canter said in a telephone interviewTuesday that he believed Aldus was the only customer that receivedthe virus.   Among Canter's clients are the nation's three largest softwareproducers _ Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Ashton-Tate, and LotusDevelopment Corp. _ and Apple.   Ashton-Tate declined comment, but officials at Microsoft, Appleand Lotus all said none of their software was infected.   Canter said the virus apparently was in a packet of software heobtained from Brandow. Unaware of the infection, Canter ran theprogam once and when he used the same computer to work on Aldussoftware, the disk eventually sent to Aldus became infected, hesaid.   The computer virus then inadvertently was copied onto disks soldto customers and infected their computers, he said.   Brandow said he met Canter, but denied giving him software.   Brandow said the virus program was written and tested for a yearon a number of Macintosh computers, and was left for two days inDecember on a Macintosh at the magazine's offices.   The publisher said he had expected that people makingunauthorized copies of programs on the machine would spread thevirus in the Montreal area and possibly a few other areas of Canadaand the United States.   Instead, Brandow said, an estimated 350,000 people in NorthAmerica and Europe had the message pop up on their computers onMarch 2.   Brandow said neither he nor his employees put the message on acomputer billboard or information network, but he did not rule outthe possibility that others who copied it without permission placedprograms containing the message on such services.   Ms. Bryant and Brandow both said the virus died out after March2.   The full message, according to Brandow, read: ``Richard Brandow,the publisher of MacMag, and its entire staff would like to takethis opportunity to convey their universal message of peace to allMacintosh users around the world.''
