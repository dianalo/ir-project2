The Yomiuri Shimbun said the cooperation will begin with theexhibition of Japan's Multi-Personal Sequential Inference (PSI)system at a Japan-U.S. symposium on artificial intelligencescheduled for Oct. 11-13 in Argonne, Ill.   The new system, a prototype fifth-generation, or artificialintelligence, computer built in November 1988, is the only one ofits kind, said Yomiuri, Japan's largest circulation newspaper.   The move is aimed at reducing friction between the two countriesover advanced technology, it said, quoting unidentified sources atthe Ministry of International Trade and Industry.   At the symposium at the Argonne National Laboratory, the twogovernments would begin using the new Japanese system in specificresearch tasks under a U.S. research program, it said.   Government officials could not be reached for comment Sunday.   After the vacuum-tube computer, the transistorized computer andthe integrated circuit computer, the fourth generation computerincludes supercomputers with very large-scale integration circuits.   The immense calculating power of supercomputers is used for suchtasks as helping meteorologists to predict weather, oilmen to drawup intricate geological maps and chemists to test molecularcombinations in the search for new drugs.   The fifth generation of computer, with very, very large-scaleintegration circuits, is envisioned as comprehending the spoken andwritten word, perfecting language-translation systems, and extendingdatabases to ``knowledge bases,'' a more complex system endowingcomputers with common-sense attributes.   In fifth-generation computer science, Yomiuri said, Japan isconsidered ``far ahead'' of the United States, France, Britain, WestGermany and others in hardware. All are developing this scienceunder government projects.   Leading the research in Japan is the Institute for New GenerationComputer Technology, a think tank of more than 70 researchersestablished in 1982 under MITI's guidance.   The equivalent of more than $1 billion in Japanese government andcorporate funds is going into the effort.   MITI decided to let U.S. National Science Foundation jointlysponsor the exhibition of the PSI system after U.S. scientistsexpressed interest in using the computer in genetic engineering,Yomiuri said.   U.S. researchers, said to be ahead of their Japanese counterpartsin genetic engineering, are interested in using the PSI computerbecause of its superior inferential ability, it said.   Yomiuri quoted anonymous MITI officials as saying Japanesescientists also could learn new genetic engineering techniques inthe joint project.</TEXT></DOC>
