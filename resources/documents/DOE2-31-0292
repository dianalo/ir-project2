Undoubtedly they are slowdue to energetic constraints. Photosynthetic bacteria can utilize solarenergy to generate ATP, which can then drive energetically unfavorablereactions. Under conditions of low intensity illumination, they readilyproduced H{sub 2} from organic acids, including acetate. Equilibriumpartial pressures of H{sub 2} were well above the K/sub s/ for H{sub2} of methanogenic bacteria. The isolation of numerous strains of photosyntheticbacteria from actively methanogenic environments suggests that this maybe a natural commensalism. Mixed cultures of photosynthetic bacteriawith non-aceticlastic methanogenic enrichments exhibited large increasesin methane production from acetate, propionate, butyrate, and lactate.The photosynthetic bacteria photoassimilate the organic acids to thelevel of endogenous sugars and sugar precursors, and then ferment thesugars to pyruvate in a subsequent dark reaction. In Rhodospirillum rubrumpyruvate is cleaved producing formate, which is a precursor to H{sub2}.</TEXT></DOC>
