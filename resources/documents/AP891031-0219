Jessica Hahn.   There may be those who say, ``You're kidding.''   To them, Jessica Hahn would say that there will be such a show,that it runs 90 minutes, that she is the hostess and that ``it'snot `Masterpiece Theater.' It's a little crazy.''   ``I'm just there for the p.r., if you ask me,'' says the formerchurch secretary, whose sexual encounter with television evangelistJim Bakker led to his loss of his PTL empire in 1987.   Bakker has been sentenced to 45 years in prison and fined$500,000 for defrauding his followers for his own enrichment. Hahnnow lives in West Hollywood, Calif., where she gave severalinterviews about him last week.   She told reporters she wasn't satisfied with the sentence givenBakker. She is pretty much talked out about him, she now says. Butshe's fully aware that ``it's always going to be identified with mebecause, in one sentence here and there (in interviews), I'm alwaysasked about it.''   A cheerful-sounding woman, despite occasional verbal rocks castat her by those who are without sin, Hahn readily acknowledges thather ``Thunder and Mud'' stint and earlier entertainment venturesare due to the publicity she got when the Bakker matter firstsurfaced.   ``Of course. One thing led to another,'' she says. She cites herPlayboy magazine appearance, talk show visits, and frequent on-airjoking with Howard Stern, the much-publicized bad boy of New Yorkradio.   ``He's a crazy man, but I love him,'' says Hahn.   Last year, she also was featured in a ``Wild Thing'' video thataired on MTV. The video spoofed rock videos and starred SamKinison, the comic who screams.   ``He sang `Wild Thing' or screamed it, whichever, and I kind offooled around,'' she says. She describes her latest venture, tapedlast month, as ``kind of a battle of the bands with a twist.''   The twist is that female mud wrestlers grapple with each otherwhile rock bands grapple with music. Each wrestler, she says,represents a different band. The bands have names like NuclearAssault, Tuff, and She-Rok.   The show is directed by Penelope Spheeris who, a press releasesays, produced the Albert Brooks movie, ``Real Life,'' and directeddocumentaries that include ``Hollywood Vice Squad'' and ``Dudes.''   ``I've got mud in front of me and heavy metal behind me,'' Hahnsays of her rock-and-mud show. ``The girls all look great _ I feltlike their grandmother,'' she adds.   Hahn, who is 30, is asked if she worries that some will say theNov. 10 show is denigrating to women. She says no. ``It's simplyfun television. It's just entertaining. It's silly. We're notclaiming to be brain surgeons.''   She is not certain of her next project, she says, or even ifshe'll try to make show business a career. ``People have beencalling me to do a record, but I think, `What gives you people theimpression I can sing?'   ``But they don't care ... they just want somebody with a namethat they can promote, I guess.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   PALMER PONDERING MOVES _ Now that Jane Pauley will leave as``Today'' co-host and Deborah Norville will succeed her, anothershift may be afoot at NBC.
