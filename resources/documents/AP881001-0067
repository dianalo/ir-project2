A few bursts of gunfire were heard around Port-au-Prince lateFriday, but there was no obvious sign today that Col. Jean-ClaudePaul was resisting the retirement. It was not known where he was.   Several Haitian leaders hailed the retirement after it wasannounced Friday. They said it showed that the 2-week-oldgovernment was moving in the right direction.   ``They are giving proof of their sincerity to oustDuvalierists,'' said Louis Dejoie, a former presidential candidate.He was referring to dictators Francois Duvalier and his son,Jean-Claude, who ruled Haiti for 29 years until the youngerDuvalier was swept from power in a popular uprising in February1986.   Both Haitian and diplomatic sources said Paul's retirement couldeventually lead to renewed U.S. aid to Haiti, which was cut offafter a massacre of 34 people during elections last November inthis Caribbean nation.   ``The situation is positive and encouraging,'' said Susan Clyde,the U.S. Embassy spokeswoman. She said the embassy was told thatPaul had been replaced by his second-in-command, Lt. Col. GuyFrancois, an American-trained officer.   The brief announcement on state television late Friday said onlythat Paul was retired from the army and his post as commander ofthe feared 700-man Dessalines Barracks in Port-au-Prince.   The announcer said the decision was signed by Haiti's president,Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, and by the minister of defense andinterior, Col. Carl Dorsainvil. It did not say when the retirementtook effect.   In March, Paul was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miamithat accused him of conspiring to import cocaine into the UnitedStates. Paul has denied any involvement.   As head of the largest unit in Haiti's 7,000-member army, Paulhad been considered one of the most powerful figures in themilitary. Haitian officials had said he could be named armed forceschief shortly after Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy took power in a militarycoup on Sept. 17.   However, officials in Washington said such a move could hurtU.S.-Haitian relations, and it never materialized.   In June, Namphy had reassigned Paul to an administrativeposition, but Paul refused and was backed by then-President LeslieManigat. Namphy ousted Manigat. Paul remained head of his battalion.   Paul has been linked to the November massacre of voters at apolling place and to the Tonton Macoutes, the hated personalsecurity forces of the Duvaliers.   Told of Paul's retirement, one Western diplomat said, ``Thismeans that the American government will certainly reinitiateassistance to Haiti, but will Jean-Claude Paul accept hisretirement?''   A Haitian government official, also speaking on condition ofanonymity, said he was surprised by the development, which hecalled ``a door wide open'' to restoration of U.S. aid.   The $70 million annual package, Haiti's largest source offoreign aid, was ended after the election massacre.   Dejoie said Friday, ``Now the guns have changed shoulders. I amvery pleased at the attitude of this government. The house-cleaningis still going on in the army.''   After rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Namphy two weeks ago,they installed Avril as president under a new military government.They said they wanted to end random, state-sponsored violence andinstitute democratic reforms, but the new rulers have set no datefor elections.   The week after the coup, chaos ruled as soldiers around thecountry rebelled against commanders and civilian mobs scoured thecountry looking for people linked to the Duvalier regimes.   About 10,000 mostly young people danced in the streets ofPort-au-Prince on Thursday in support of the soldiers' coup. It wasone of the biggest outpourings seen in the capital sinceJean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in France. Some of themchanted ``Long Live Paul, Down With America.''</TEXT></DOC>
