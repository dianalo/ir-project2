Brian Fantl, director of labor relations for the newspaper, saida pay raise could be part of the offer, but that an agreement withthe federal mediator prevented him from revealing details of theproposal.   The proposal was taken to the union's executive committee, andFantl said he expected a response later Monday.   Union representatives were at a meeting at the Sun-Times and wereunavailable for comment.   As the strike deadline of 2:30 p.m. came and went, both sidessaid they were prepared for a walkout, which would be the firststrike by editorial workers in the newspaper's 40-year history.   ``The picket-line chants are all set and ready to go,'' unionspokesman Dan Lehmann, the newspaper's religion writer, said earlierin the day. Picket signs and leaflets were printed and waiting, hesaid.   Sun-Times spokesman Michael Soll said management did not want astrike, but was ``fully prepared to produce a paper'' using companyexecutives, non-union editors and outside writers.   At the rival Chicago Tribune, a 40-month-long printers strikecould end this week following the strikers' overwhelming approval ofa new three-year contract. But walkouts by mailers and pressmen atthe newspaper continued.   The strike deadline at the Sun-Times was set by Chicago NewspaperGuild Local 71, which represents 250 reporters, editors,photographers and support staff. The union has been working withouta contract since June 1.   Soll said company negotiators were willing to meet around theclock, and he hoped an agreement could be reached at the meeting,which began at 9 a.m. Monday.   A federal mediator, William Sigler, was working with negotiators,officials said.   ``There seems to be much less anguish and much more hope'' thanin previous days, Soll said after talks resumed.   The guild has been seeking a 19.5 percent pay raise over threeyears. Prior to Monday, management had proposed a 3 percent salarycut for 18 months, followed by a restoration of current pay levelsfor the remainder of the three-year pact, guild unit chairman ThomasGibbons said.   Starting reporters earn $625 weekly, going up to $895 forreporters with five years' experience.   In addition, Gibbons said, differences remained over managementproposals to cut night differential for workers by 40 percent andexempt eight senior editorial staffers from union jurisdiction.   Soll said ``the paper is healthy financially'' but must controlcosts to remain competitive with the larger Chicago Tribune, whichhas an estimated circulation of 765,000 daily and 1.117 millionSunday.   The Sun-Times, whose circulation is estimated at 605,000 dailyand 614,000 on Sunday, was purchased from media baron Rupert Murdochfor $145 million in June 1986 by a group of investors led by the NewYork investment firm Adler andamp; Shaykin.   At the Tribune, members of Local 16 of the Chicago TypographicalUnion voted 180-43 Sunday to approve the new pact and an $8.56million settlement fund. Tribune President Charles Brumback hasuntil Thursday to decide whether to sign the agreement.   Under its terms, the 119 printers still on strike, down from 240who walked out originally, would have the option of a buyout or alifetime annuity, as well as receiving company-paid medicalcoverage. About 50 printers who went back to work under a 1986unconditional offer to return can stay on at the paper under termsof the three-year contract, which includes pay increases, or theycan accept a $30,000 cash buyout.</TEXT></DOC>
