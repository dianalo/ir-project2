At the same time, the company avoided having its authorized rate of return slashed to 12% from 15.2%, as had been proposed last month -- along with a one-year, 3.3% rate reduction -- by the New York Public Service Commission.    Instead, Consolidated Edison and the commission agreed to a partial, three-year 12.9% cap on the utility's return on common equity. Analysts said the move, which technically leaves the authorized return on the books at 15.2%, was mutually advantageous.    Also yesterday, the commission, in a disputed 2-1 vote, increased Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.'s electric rates by between $60 million and $70 million a year, or 3.2% to 3.6%, based on a 12.7% rate of return.    Mark D. Luftig, utility analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc., explained that, had the commission lowered Consolidated Edison's authorized return to 12.9%, it would have been hard pressed to justify giving Niagara Mohawk only 12.7%, given that Niagara Mohawk isn't in as sound financial shape as Consolidated Edison because of nuclear-plant construction problems.    At the same time, Mr. Luftig said, by keeping a 15.2% return on the books, Consolidated Edison would be better positioned, should interest rates go up, to ask the commission to authorize a 14% or so rate of return since the commissioners could argue that they are actually lowering the utility's authorized rate of return from 15.2%.    The rate rollback reflects in part the new lower federal tax rate. Consolidated Edison, which serves New York City and Westchester County, hasn't had a rate increase since 1983. Nevertheless, New York City electric rates remain among the highest in the U.S., along with San Diego, Honolulu and Long Island, N.Y. With the rate rollback, the average customer's monthly power bill will drop about $1.10 to $34.25, the utility said.    The agreement benefits Consolidated Edison in that, while there is a 12.9% cap, the utility will be allowed to keep one half of revenue earned in excess of that cap. The other half will be refunded to ratepayers. &quot;It's an incentive for good management,&quot; said Judith Warrick, utility analyst for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Consolidated Edison's stock closed at $45.50, up 75 cents.    The commission's vote on Niagara Mohawk became embroiled in a legal dispute over whether a majority of sitting members voted in favor of the increase. As previously reported, several newly nominated members are awaiting legislative approval, and the outgoing chairman, Paul Gioia, declined to cast a vote. Thus, while acting commission Chairman Anne F. Mead yesterday said the 2-1 vote was legally binding, the dissenting commissioner, Harold A. Jerry, said it wasn't, arguing that three yes votes were needed.    The dispute may be crucial to whether Niagara Mohawk can maintain its current dividend rate of $2.08 a share. Mr. Luftig said Niagara Mohawk needs a 12.9% to 13% return rate to keep that dividend rate and that with 12.7%, &quot;it's going to be close.&quot; Mr. Jerry, meanwhile, is known to favor a 13% return.    In Syracuse, N.Y., a spokesman for Niagara Mohawk declined to comment because of the uncertainty surrounding the commission's action. </TEXT></DOC>
