Mr. Robertson, the former religious broadcaster known more for his stance on social issues than for his economic pronouncements, is airing a controversial television commercial touting his economic proposals and charging that those of Rep. Kemp would lead to five years of depression. The commercial, airing two to three times a day on several New Hampshire TV stations this week, cites a recent economic forecaster's report showing that the &quot;economic plan of Pat Robertson led the pack&quot; of presidential candidates.    Rep. Kemp, a New York congressman who led the fight for tax-rate cuts as a way to stimulate economic growth, is fuming. His campaign has lined up economists Paul Craig Roberts, who is a former assistant Treasury secretary, and Richard Rahn of the Chamber of Commerce -- both supply-siders like Mr. Kemp -- to criticize the study and the firm that produced it, Washington Econometrics Forecasting Services. In a Kemp news release, George Gilder, a supply-side author, calls the study lauded in the Robertson commercial &quot;about as serious as astrology predictions.&quot;    Some of Washington Econometrics' analysis does seem a little out of the ordinary. In a section that doesn't deal with the candidates, the disputed study predicts a depression, partly because of a &quot;rise of decadence and a lowering of moral standards within society.&quot; It cites as evidence that the number of abortions exceeds live births, drugs have moved from ghettos to halls of power, homosexuality is presented as an alternative life style rather than as grounds for dismissal and music videos carry a &quot;pre-eminent theme . . . of Satanic sacrifice.&quot;    The firm's chairman, James O'Connor acknowledges, &quot;I agree with Robertson on social issues,&quot; but says he has no affiliation with the former TV evangelist. &quot;We aren't a political firm,&quot; insists Mr. O'Connor, who says his clients include Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and PaineWebber Inc.    The economic forecast was reported in The Wall Street Journal last month, and the Robertson advertisement includes this fact in heralding the study &quot;as if it had been the object of a serious article&quot; in this newspaper, a Kemp news release charges. &quot;The Journal's brief story on the study was placed in the paper's second section, in a corner usually reserved for light articles and outright humor or satire,&quot; the release states.    &quot;We didn't consider the study or the article a joke,&quot; says Connie Snapp, communications director for the Robertson campaign. &quot;We saw it as legitimate.&quot;    The commercial, which was played in Iowa on TV and radio in the final days before the caucuses in which Mr. Robertson surprisingly beat Vice President Bush, &quot;has an impact,&quot; according to Miss Snapp. &quot;Pat's a conservative, and we want to distinguish him from Jack Kemp, who remains strong in New Hampshire,&quot; she says.    Some economists express caution about any conclusions drawn from candidates' typically broad statements. &quot;I would be very skeptical of the results,&quot; says Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. &quot;I would not suggest anyone make a decision on who to vote for based on a study like this.&quot;    While the Robertson campaign wants voters to be impressed with his current economic positions, some of Mr. Robertson's previous economic views aren't talked about much these days.    In a monthly economic newsletter written by Mr. Robertson to donors of his 700 Club in 1981, for example, the television preacher advocated abolishing the Social Security and Federal Reserve systems. He would replace the Social Security system with a program allowing workers to &quot;save through regulated institutions acting as mutual funds.&quot;    In the same issue, he also proposed that the U.S. adopt a constitutional amendment: &quot;At the end of every 49 years would be a 50th year of Jubilee. In the year of Jubilee, all debts would be canceled.&quot; The idea, Mr. Robertson explained, was borrowed from a practice followed by the Jews in the Old Testament.    A couple of years earlier, Mr. Robertson predicted a &quot;major world-wide depression in the early 1980s.&quot; That depression, he wrote, would be followed by a Soviet attack on the Middle East and a nuclear war &quot;on an awesome scale.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
