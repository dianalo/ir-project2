Threetopics are specifically addressed: an unusually general method of optimizingnetworks is developed; a network model is developed that facilitatesthe optimization and it itself valuable; and the statistical nature ofthe data-communication traffic on networks is examined to support themodel. The model permits the analysis of delays in heterogeneous networksof complex topology. The focus of this dissertation is on the optimizationof networks. The optimization is built upon the model. The algorithmvaries capacity and routing to minimize network cost. The capacity-assignmentalgorithm developed is an iterative algorithm that allows arbitrarilycomplex queuing models to be used. It is because of this algorithm thatthe optimization can be applied to a wide range of heterogeneous network.The routing algorithms is basically the flow deviation algorithm of Gerla.</TEXT></DOC>
