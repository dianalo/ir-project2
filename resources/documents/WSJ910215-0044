Overtime became routine as the big defense contractor, aformer Honeywell Inc. unit, moved to meet a fresh $20 millionPentagon order for the shells spawned by the Persian Gulfconflict. The company even added two more shifts.</LP><TEXT>   But things have suddenly changed at the plant -- and thePentagon has taken notice. Last weekend, the company's 1,300local production workers, represented by the Teamsters union,rejected a proposed contract and shut the plants down withtheir picket lines.   A government spokesman said yesterday that the U.S. isclosely monitoring the strike, because the 25mm shells arecritical to the war effort. Alliant is one of only twocontractors that make the rounds, which are used in theBradley Fighting Vehicle and another personnel carrier --both of which would see heavy use if the U.S. and alliedmilitary forces begin a ground assault against Iraqi troopsin Kuwait.   The U.S. believes it has a sufficient supply of theammunition for its vehicles &quot;at the moment,&quot; a spokesman forthe Army's Armament, Munitions and Chemical Command says, buthe concedes the estimates are based on projections for theduration of the war that could easily change.   At the Minnetonka, Minn., company's plant here, limitedproduction resumed earlier this week by managers and nonunionemployees after a county judge issued a restraining ordertemporarily blocking mass picketing at the facilities. Thecompany's other production facilities in the Minneapolis arearemain closed.   Ironically, workers who in the past felt constrained todefend themselves for earning a living producing the weaponsof war now find themselves drawing fire because they'vestopped. &quot;We're not being unpatriotic,&quot; contends picketerRobert McEachern, a press operator who worked on theammunition line for 12 consecutive days, with overtime, justbefore the strike. &quot;There's nothing I'd like better than togo back to work.&quot;   Adds another striker, Brenda Musgjerd: &quot;If we knew ourboys were in jeopardy, we wouldn't be doing this.&quot; She saysthe angry motorists who honk their horns and make rude handgestures at the striking workers should understand &quot;thegovernment has stockpiles&quot; of the munitions.   The strike -- over pay -- raises unsettling questionsabout war profits, and who gets to share in them, that otherdefense contractors may face if the Gulf war is a lengthyconflict. Alliant stockholders have seen the value of theirholdings almost double since Honeywell last autumn spun offits defense operations when it couldn't find a buyer forthem. Orders at the company, which has annual revenue of$1.25 billion, have climbed since Iraq invaded Kuwait lastAugust.   The striking workers, who currently earn wages averagingabout $12.40 an hour, are demanding higher wages in amultiyear contract. Alliant, however, has offered aneight-month extension of the old contract, which expired Feb.1, along with a bonus of between $800 and $1,600 peremployee. The union rejected that offer on a vote of 630-375.Late yesterday, the union disclosed that it has scheduled aspecial meeting for Sunday, at which members will vote on a&quot;new offer&quot; from Alliant; terms weren't disclosed.   Alliant workers note that their former Honeywell parentrecently reached what they consider a better contract withits Teamster-union employees. Anita Swanson, a 15-yearemployee who paints the 25mm shells yellow with a pinkstripe, sees Alliant's offer for only a short-term contractextension as a ploy to ease workers past the current bountyso it can plead poverty again when the Gulf crisis passes andorders slow.   For their part, Alliant officials say they're confidentthe company can fulfill the 25mm-ammunition order, which isamong the $50 million in government contracts received sincethe Gulf conflict started. The company makes deliveries atthe end of every month and it was ahead of schedule at theend of January, officials say.   Under federal labor law, President Bush could orderAlliant workers to return to their jobs if he decided the wareffort was being impeded by the strike. Such a move wouldhave to follow a finding that other contractors, includingthe other current supplier of the 25mm shells -- Aerojet Inc.of Chino, Calif. -- couldn't make up for Alliant's lostproduction.   During the Vietnam War, Honeywell's weapons plantsfrequently drew crowds of chanting anti-war protesters. Andmaking weapons -- particularly the kind that kill up close,like land mines and machine-gun bullets -- remains a touchysubject for some of the Alliant workers. &quot;I'm a mother offive children, four of them boys,&quot; says Patricia Johnson, whosays she had to &quot;reason things out&quot; before she becamecomfortable making parts for anti-personnel mines.   Ms. Johnson, seeking brief shelter yesterday in a warm carbefore returning to picket duty in a brutal arctic wind, saysshe attends church each Sunday. &quot;We always sing the samesong, `Let there be peace, and let it begin with me,'&quot; shesays. &quot;I always cry.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
