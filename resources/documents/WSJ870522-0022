The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said the hospital failed to record injuries and illnesses affecting its workers in 1985 and 1986, including cuts, burns, infectious diseases, sprains, strains and fractures. The charges included a citation for a repeat violation of OSHA requirements, stemming from a citation issued in February 1985.    Yale-New Haven has 15 working days to contest the charges before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Hospital officials couldn't be reached for comment late yesterday.    OSHA said the hospital failed to record any worker injuries and illnesses from August to November 1986, but that OSHA investigators found nearly 30 instances in that period.    The hospital's rate of injuries that caused lost work days in 1985 was 11.9 cases per 100 workers, compared with a nationwide rate for hospitals of 3.8 cases per 100 employees, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.    The hospital's guidelines considered treatment of injuries requiring sutures, splints, cervical collars, slings, crutches and braces as &quot;first aid&quot; and didn't record them, OSHA said, but added that they must be recorded under OSHA and BLS guidelines. </TEXT></DOC>
