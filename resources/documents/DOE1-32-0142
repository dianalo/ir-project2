<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-0142 </DOCNO><TEXT>Second-order perturbation theory is the simplest way to go beyond theSelf Consistent Field (SCF) approximation in ab initio quantum chemicalcalculations. It is therefore desirable to have efficient computer programsthat will evaluate analytically the gradient and the second derivativeof the MP2 energy; in this way molecular geometries and harmonic vibrationalfrequencies can be calculated more accurately than at the SCF level.Although the MP2 analytic gradient has been available for a number ofyears, the theory for the analytic second derivatives has been recentlypresented. The authors developed a fully vectorized computer programto evaluate analytically both derivatives of the MP2 energy, which hasmade possible the evaluation of the molecular geometry and harmonic forceconstants at the MP2 level. Results are reported.</TEXT></DOC>
