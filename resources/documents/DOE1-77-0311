This paper will review estimates of currentand historical emissions and analyze projections of future emissionsof these pollutants. Historical changes in emission levels can be usedin the investigation of long-term trends in precipitation acidity, drydeposition, air quality, and cumulative effects on forest, aquatic systems,and agricultural and material resources. Projections of future emissionsaid in the assessment of the possible future intensity and geographicaldistribution of acidic depositon that might occur in the absence of additionalcontrol measures and in the analysis of the effectiveness and costs ofpossible new measures to reduce emissions.</TEXT></DOC>
