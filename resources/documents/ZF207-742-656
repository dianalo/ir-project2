 If you have to make important decisions, Decision Padcould prove a powerful ally.andM;This program less you turn your preferences and assessments into numericratings, and then you can use those ratings to rank alternatives (see thescreens, next page).andP;  If conditions change after you make your choice, youcan use Decision Pad to determine the point at which an alternative should bechosen.andM;After you've made a choice, Decision Pad helps you anticipate and respond tocriticism.andP;  For example, if you have chosen a particular investment strategy,it's easy to determine the underlying assumptions of those who disagree withyour choice and to discuss objectively the available alternatives.andM;You could do this kind of work with 1-2-3 rather than with Decision Pad, butit wouldn't be easy.andP;  As alternatives and criteria grow in number, a1-2-3-based model would slow down and become mathematically complex.andP;  What'smore, using intuition to assign numerical values and weights to criteria isnot easy.andP;  For example, how do you weight education against experience?andM;Decision Pad handles such problems for you.andP;  It does the math and providestools that make it easier to assign relative values and weights.andP;  After youdo the setup work, in most cases it delivers answers in seconds.andP;  And if youhave already created a 1-2-3 worksheet to rank alternatives, Decision Pad canimport the relevant data into its own worksheet with a single command.andM;The product can also frustrate you in a number of ways.andP;  It takes time to setup a comparison in Decision Pad's worksheet.andP;  The program provides no way toautomate what-if analyses, which would make it easier to test your prioritiesand conclusions.andP;  And the program has one or two quirks that can slow youdown.andM;A final caveat: Because Decision Pad ultimately makes its conclusions basedon numbers, the program can discourage you from playing hunches.andP;  In fact, itwill clearly spell out all the reasons to ignore your hunch.andP;  Only your ownjudgment can tell you when to follow the program and when to indulge yourintuition.andM;CHOOSING A COMPANY CARandM;To understand how Decision Pad works, let's suppose your manager asks you topick the car model your company should buy for its fleet.andP;  Assume that shehas already done enough research to know that she's interested in four cars,which we'll call Wonder Wagon, Cheetah, Miler, and Road King.andP;  You know thecars will be used heavily, so you infer that, in addition to purchase price,you should value comfort, fuel economy, and dependability.andP;  Furthermore, youlearn through the grapevine that the president slightly favors the Road King.andM;You first consult a popular consumer magazine to gather information.andP;  In ityou find a host of test results for each car, as well as results for othercars in the same class.andP;  Now you're ready to use Decision Pad.andP;  As you enterthe various models and their test results, the program automatically arrangesthe data into a table.andM;Next, you assign a value, or a score, to each criterion.andP;  The magazinepresents some criteria, such as cost and mileage, numerically.andP;  A highermileage rating should be given a higher score.andP;  Conversely, a higher costshould receive a lower score.andP;  Decision Pad lets you easily specify bothrelationships through the program's predefined menu choices.andM;The magazine offers qualitative ratings of other features.andP;  For example, itrates each car's repair record as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.andO;Decision Pad gives you several ways to turn such ratings into numbers.andP;  Youcan let the program automatically rank ratings from excellent to poor on ascale of 1 to 10.andP;  If you decide that any rating deserves a higher or lowerscore, you can manually adjust the scale.andM;Or you can score criteria graphically.andP;  According to the program users whom Iinterviewed, that feature is especially useful for scoring subjectivepreferences.andP;  Suppose, for instance, that each car is available with aleather, vinyl, cloth, or velour interior.andP;  Decision Pad lets you create agraph containing a bar for each type of interior.andP;  You can lengthen orshorten a bar in comparison with the others (&quot;I like velour this much morethan leather.&quot;) and the program will generate a numerical score.andP;  Users alsofound that scoring all preferences at once like this helped them to keep eachscore in perspective.andM;If you need data not supplied by the magazine you consulted, you might visitcar dealers yourself.andP;  To help you record what you learn, Decision Pad will,for each alternative, print a form that you can take with you.andM;WEIGHTS AND WHAT-IFandM;Once you score the criteria, you weight each one to reflect your priorities.andO;You can assign weights either numerically or graphically, just as you canwith values.andP;  You can assign a weight to each criterion or break the criteriainto subgroups and assign a weight to each subgroup.andM;For example, if you were to weight list price and mileage separately, youmight mistakenly assign the list price a higher weight, even though mileagecontributes to overall cost of the car.andP;  If you combine them into a subgroup,you can still rank those items separately, but you ensure that the overallcost is what you evaluate, not just one component of that cost.andM;Although building a model takes time, you can change the data it contains aseasily as you can in a 1-2-3 worksheet.andP;  For example, by experimenting with afew weighs in the model, you can show the president that his favorite car isthe best choice only if cost is half as important as you originallydetermined.andM;Unfortunately, Decision Pad gives you neither a way to automate such what-ifanalysis nor a macro language to let you implement the automation yourself.andO;That's a shame, because if you work with variable criteria, automated what-ifanalysis makes it easier to identify the precise point at which onealternative becomes better than another.andM;For example, suppose your worksheet determines that the Wonder Wagon is thebest alternative if each car sells at its suggested retail price.andP;  Afterfurther research, however, you learn that Miler prices vary significantlyfrom one dealership to another, so you want to know the price at which theMiler becomes the best choice.andP;  With Decision Pad you'll have to keepentering new prices until the program ranks the Miler first, then workbackward to find the exact dollar figure that puts the Miler on top.andP;  Itwould save time if you could specify a goal and let the program repeat thewhat-if test until it found the result.andM;You can use two of the program's 12 predefined reports to complement manualwhat-if testing.andP;  One report records up to 12 what-if tests and thensummarizes both the assumptions and the results of each test.andM;Another report generates a sensitivity analysis for your model.andP;  First itdoubles the value of the weight assigned to the most heavily weightedcriterion or criteria group.andP;  Then it tests each criterion with each of sixweights equally spaced between zero and that doubled value.andP;  For example, ifyour most heavily weighted criterion is weighted 20, this report would testevery criterion for the weights 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40.andM;THINGS TO WATCH FORandM;Decision Pad's method of handling missing information can deceive you.andP;  Forexample, if you don't have a value for a criterion for one of the cars, theprogram displays a question mark in that space and scores that criterion asthe range between the lowest and highest scores given to other cars for thatcriterion.andP;  The program then determines the car's total score as a rangebetween the lowest and highest possible total scores.andM;According to the tutorial that comes along with the program, if that car'slowest possible total score is higher than all the other cars' highestpossible scores, &quot;you now have enough data to show a winner,&quot; and you &quot;may bewasting effort to fill in any remaining question marks&quot; in your worksheet.andO;However, if you enter a value well outside the range of values assigned toother cars for that criterion, you could easily get a result different fromthe one suggested by the program.andP;  A Decision Pad product-supportrepresentative recommended setting the range of scores manually rather thanletting the program set the range by default, as described above.andM;Most smaller models recalculate instantaneously.andP;  However, several of theusers to whom I spoke said that as you add more values that are greater than10,000 to the worksheet.andP;  Decision Pad slows.andP;  In my tests on a 10 MHz80286-based computer, a worksheet made up of 77 six-digit numbersrecalculated instantaneously.andP;  A worksheet four times that size took abouttwo seconds.andM;Decision Pad has several hot keys, but none for the command sequences you usemost.andP;  Particularly helpful would be hot keys for adding and deleting acriterion or alternative.andP;  You perform these tasks constantly, and eachrequires at least four keystrokes.andM;If you have pertinent data stored in a 1-2-3 worksheet, you may be able touse another program from the same manufacturer, Smart Import, rather thanre-enter data into Decision Pad.andP;  As long as the column and row headings inyour 1-2-3 worksheet, are the same as the names of criteria and alternativesin your Decision Pad worksheet, Smart Import will import the data where itbelongs.andP;  Note that if you format a criterion in Decision Pad, Smart Importwill import into that criterion row only data in the same format.andP;  Althoughit's a well-designed feature, most users to whom I spoke don't use SmartImport.andP;  It seems once they begin using Decision Pad, they no longer need tokeep such data in 1-2-3.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
