Britain invited the officials, who gathered last week outside London, in the hope of improving communication among authorities overseeing the world's major financial markets. British officials declined to discuss specific measures considered by the participants, who also used the gathering to hold a series of informal bilateral talks.    &quot;The focus was on methods of enhancing arrangements for the exchange of information,&quot; said Brian Hilton, a British Trade and Industry Department official and the meeting's chairman. In particular, he indicated Britain seeks full information about entrants into its own markets from other countries. &quot;We believe in prevention being better than the cure,&quot; he said.    Britain, which has overhauled its regulatory system to cope with the liberalization of London's securities markets, has sought to improve information flows with other major financial centers and recently signed a memorandum of understanding providing for information exchange with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Britain is negotiating a similar agreement with Japan and has said it will seek agreements with the others in the 10-nation group.    Interest in the issue has been heightened by insider-trading cases in New York and London and the British probe into trading of shares of Guinness PLC. Mr. Hilton declined to comment on the role of cooperation with the U.S. in the specific cases.    In addition to Britain, the authorities represented were from Australia, Canada, West Germany, France, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
