Poor</HEAD><BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Many of the economic considerations of aproposed capital gains tax cut now have become obscured by politicsand reduced to a question: Would a cut be a gift to the rich at theexpense of the poor?   Some studies say it would be, the reasoning being that mostcapital-gain dollars, or financial gains on appreciation oflong-term assets, are earned by the wealthy. Internal RevenueService figures document it.   Those figures show, for instance, that in 1986 the group withtotal income of $1 million or more earned more than one-third ofall capital gains. The percentage often has been cited in defenseof the rich vs. poor argument.   Less often cited are data from the same source showing thatpeople with medium or low income constitute nearly 18 percent ofcapital gains earners, and that they might fare worse than the rich.   Moreover, says Ron Utt, former deputy director of the Office ofManagement and Budget, those figures must be read with a veryserious caveat: that some relatively poor people may become``rich'' once in their lives.   Once is enough, however, statistically to catapult them into thehigher brackets.   Utt, now a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation,observes that even relatively poor people can be hit hard bycapital gains. Who? An elderly widow selling her home, a parentselling stock to pay for a child's education.   It also might be a hard-working citizen who sells a business, oralmost anyone who tediously saved a few thousand dollars in amutual fund, or a divorced couple selling a home into which theyhad poured hearts and dollars.   For one year, the year in which they disposed of their assets,they became rich for tax purposes, forever leaving their imprint onthe national statistics and their own financial well being.   The tendency to view capital gains, and capital gains taxes, asaffecting only the rich led to obscuring another economicconsideration when the tax was raised from a maximum of 20 percentto a maximum of 28 percent in 1986.   That increase did indeed impact the rich; it was, after, all a40 percent increase. Often overlooked then, and now, is the factthat under the old rules the taxes of many low and middle-incometaxpayers amounted to only 14 percent. They too jumped to 28percent, doubling in one legislative swipe.   That was part of the increase. Because of legislative action atthe state level, or because state tax rates were based on thefederal model, state taxes also rose, some between 100 percent and200 percent.   An economic consideration often referred to by supporters of acapital gains tax cut is the injustice of taxing people on capitalgains income never earned. The tax is applied quite literally tothe inflated value of assets.   But while taxing people on inflation may be unreasonable, it isseldom pointed out that the assets involved may have grown moreswiftly because taxes were deferred until sold. That observationalso seems to have been forgotten.   Important also, is the potential significance of capital gainstaxes for the United States as a global competitor. Capital gainstaxes are not universal; they are rare, restricted mainly to suchindustrial giants as the United States _ which has the highest _Britain, Sweden, Canada and France.   In a 1987 report, the accounting firm Arthur Andersen pointedout that West Germany, Belgium, Italy, Japan and the Netherlandsexempted long-term capital gains. Also exempting them were HongKong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia, all on a fasttrack to industrial might and competitive power.   These and many other economic considerations have beenoverwhelmed in the heat of the political battle, a battle thatseems to have distilled the important issues to just one.</TEXT><NOTE>End Advance PMs Tuesday, July 25</NOTE></DOC>
