 Having had ataste of the convenience of connectivity, users want more than a snappyalternative to sneakernet.andP;  Nor will they be satisfied with faster speeds,higher bandwidth, or more robust media on a local level.andP;  As they looktowards the next millennium, users want to be able to communicate withanyone, anywhere in the world, and they want to be able to do it quickly,reliably, and cheaply.andM;Users are not without their options for wide area networking now, but formany companies using LANs, the current solutions are inadequate.andP;  Users caneither choose a public or private packet-switching network like X.25, or theycan lease circuit-switched lines from the phone company, but both schemeshave serious drawbacks for LAN users with data-intensive applications.andO;Packet-switched networks, while they accommodate intermittent or burstytraffic, are restricted to speeds of 64Kbps.andP;  That introduces a bottleneckeven for today's 4Mbps, 10Mbps, and 16Mbps LANs, not to mention emerging100Mbps LAN technologies.andP;  Leased lines, while not restricted to allocationin 64Kbps chunks, are expensive, since users pay whether the lines are usedor not.andM;Some companies have abandoned phone lines altogether and run their own cable,usually fiber, between installations, but that's hardly practical for thegreat majority of users.andP;  Fiber canbe prohibitively expensive, and oftenlegal impediments restrict running lines through urban areas, especially overcounty lines.andM;Divestiture and customers' growing data demands have sent phone companies,here and abroad, scrambling for alternatives to present offerings.andP;  The idealsolution would support high speeds and geographic distances of hundreds ofkilometers and be available economically to all users.andP;  For the past sixyears, vendors and standards bodies have been investigating solutions forjust such Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).andM;Since 1984, various schemes have been presented by companies, but the lasttwo years have seen the strongest push towards a standard implementation ofMANs.andP;  The IEEE 802.6 committee responsible for the MAN standard is unusualin the respect that its charter is not to standardize the implementation of atechnology--as with 802.3 or 802.5--but to find the best solution for theapplication.andM;Once the dust settled from the various MAN solutions proposed, two clearcompetitors were left.andP;  The first was FDDI, already popular as a backbonetechnology.andP;  Not only is FDDI capable of high-speed communications, but italso allows for a extended distances between networked sites.andM;However, FDDI is still considered a private solution, suitable for campuswideand high-speed workstation networking.andP;  In 1986, a group of researchers atthe University of Western Australia, in conjunction with Telecom Australia,proposed a MAN implementation called Queued Packet Synchronous eXchange(QPSX).andP;  The standard received enthusiastic support from most of thetelephone industry and was soon adopted by the 802.6 committee, who changedthe name to Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) to avoid confusion between thestandard and the company QPSX Communications that Telecom Australia hadformed to further research into the proposed protocol.andM;The key characteristic of DQDB is its topology.andP;  DQDB specifies twounidirectional buses that operate in opposite directions.andP;  That means thateach node on the network has two transmission links, increasing the potentialbandwidth of the network to twice its speed.andP;  For example, a node that couldtransmit at 45Mbps using both links would actually have a 90Mbps bandwidth.andM;DQDB also allows for a fault-tolerant implementation of the dual bustopology, called a looped dual bus.andP;  Under normal, &quot;no-fault&quot; conditions, onenode acts as both the head and end of the data flow of each bus.andP;  When acable break occurs, the head moves to the nearest adjacent node that canperform the head of bus functions, thus preserving network continuity.andP;  Nodesbetween the break and the new head are dropped until the problem is solved.andO;Furthermore, dQDB dynamically allocates bandwidth to nodes as it is needed,by alloting time in the form of slots to a 125 microsecond frame.andP;  Slots varyin number per frame depending on the bus's bit rate.andP;  Each node on thenetwork can generate and receive either synchronous or asynchronous traffic.andM;802.6 MANs will not be restricted to providing simple data communicationseither.andP;  They will also allow for video and voice to be transferred over thesame links, using two types of access methods, one time-sensitive for voiceand video, and the other not, for packetized data.andM;With the phone company providing voice, video, and data over the same networkat high speeds sounds a lot like ISDN, and in fact, the 802.6 standard ispositioned to migrate to broadband ISDN.andP;  MANs could even be thought of astesting grounds for ISDN services.andP;  Some users need the data services of aMAN right now; if they begin to take advantage of and come to rely on thevoice and video services as well it could guarantee the eventual success ofISDN.andM;This is not to say that FDDI is a dud where wide area networking isconcerned.andP;  Rather, the 802.6 industry seems to view FDDI networks as aprimary source of bandwidth-intensive MAN traffic.andP;  FDDI is available now asa private, point-to-point, limited distance technology, whereas 802.6 MANsare public, connectionless, switched networks with no distance limitations.andO;FDDI is considered the ideal local solution, partially because of the expenseinvolved in point-to-point fiber connections.andP;  &quot;We envision that FDDI will beused within a customer's installation, and QPSX will be used outside of it,&quot;says Achilles Perdikaris, executive vice president of operations at QPSX'sHolmdel, N.J., subsidiary.andP;  &quot;We're happy that FDDI is out there to stimulatehigh-speed services.&quot;andM;QPSX communications holds many patents key to implementing 802.6 networks,but it has entered into licensing agreements with Alcatel and Siemens, whowill manufacture, distribute, and support all QPSX products.andP;  The product setis comprised of cluster common equipment, QPSX network nodes and, perhapsmost essentially, network management tools.andM;The cluster common equipment provides basic services that are shared byseveral nodes, including digital timing interfaces, timing synchronization,subnetwork configuration controllers, frame generators, and the clustermanagement processor.andP;  The QPSX nodes are supported within the cluster andprovide either direct connections to LANs or interconnections forsubnetworks.andP;  The QPSX Network Management Center (NMC) is implemented on afault-tolerant platform and provides accounting, performance, fault,configuration, and security management.andM;MANs at TempleandM;QPSX products are currently being used in the first North American trial of a45Mbps MAN, undertaken at Temple University by Bell Atlantic.andP;  Already asophisticated LAN user, Temple was an ideal choice both because of itsgeography and its data needs.andP;  The university is spread over two campuses indowntown Philadelphia, with an advanced medical facility on one campusremotely located from the central computer center on the other.andP;  Not only didthe university need to interconnect the two sites, it needed a network thatcould handle high-end applications, such as medical imaging and molecularmodeling.andM;Bell Atlantic's offering, known as Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS),was developed in response to a user need for high-speed data transport.andO;Initially, SMDS will be used to interconnect LANs and high-poweredworkstations in the corporate arena, but Bell Atlantic also envisions supportfor video, teleconferencing, CAD/CAM, and medical imaging applications.andM;The Temple installation connects 13 Ethernet and one Token Ring networks atthe main campus to two customer clusters.andP;  Those clusters are connected overfiber to two edge clusters, which act like central office switches, and inturn connect the medical facility, with its three Ethernet LANs and one TokenRing.andP;  The two edge clusters are also connected to the Data Network Controlcenter over a point-to-point 9.6Kbps line.andM;The trial started in June 1990, with the commissioning and initialinstallation of the network.andP;  Phase 1, begun in July, provided the end-to-endconnection.andP;  In October, Bell Atlantic began to provide switching, and thetrial should be completed by April 1991.andP;  SMDS should be commerciallyavailable by the second quarter of 1991 on an individual contract basis, asis typical for any introductory service.andP;  After customer interest reachescritical mass, Bell Atlantic will determine the tariff and anticipatewidespread implementation of SMDS as soon as it is brought to market.andM;MANs At HomeandM;MANs have implications beyond the corporate arena.andP;  The high bandwidth makesthem perfect entertainment solutions, as well.andP;  MANs could be used to provideall advanced video and voice services on demand in homes, and experimentaltrials are being conducted across the country to determine what services canbe provided and which are the most popular.andM;The potential for these domestic services is not nearly so immediate as thatof 802.6 MANs are in the corporate world.andP;  Furthermore, the media choice isnot restricted to fiber, although it will probably be the most popular.andM;Just as the services rendered by 802.6 MANs are similar to traditional phoneservices, MANs in the home are akin to cable TV.andP;  That's not to say thatcable TV companies are embracing it.andP;  GTE's recent trial in Cerritos, Calif.,andO;prompted local the cable TV operators to file a complaint with the FCC, whichhad granted GTE permission to undertake a citywide installation of theirfiber-based system.andM;The GTE trial provides 700 homes in Cerritos with phone service over fiber.andO;One hundred homes also receive telephone and interactive television servicesover a second fiber network.andP;  These include pay-per-view service thatprovides movies on several channels every 15 minutes.andM;Five homes in this Los Angeles suburb will receive a special converter thatwill provide them with a service that GTE hopes will force video rentalstores out of business: The householders will be able to demand any movie atany time.andP;  No more waiting in line, unavailable cassettes, or late fees atthe video store.andP;  The potential is staggering.andP;  The network will be able toprovide regular cable service, and one local operator has leased about halfof GTE's bandwidth for traditional cable TV services.andM;Applitek (Andover, Mass.) is betting that it will be existing cable TV media,and not fiber, that will be the most popular MAN media.andP;  Using cable TV,Applitek can take advantage of existing cable plants at relatively low costs.andO;With cable TV equipment already in millions of homes, Applitek is positionedto penetrate the work-at-home market by providing domestic connectivity tooffice networks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
