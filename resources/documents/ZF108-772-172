 That's either one of the dumbest or one of the cagiest thingsI've ever heard anyone say about computers.andP;  Let's think a minute about whatwe can read into this quote.andM;Sure, you can buy a bunch of off-the-shelf components, slap them together,and put a zoomy label on it.andP;  But the resulting machine likely will be amediocre set of compromises that lacks distinguishing features, userbenefits, or even a competitive price.andP;  Building a PC that people really wantto buy takes careful selection of product features, matching of components,and fine-tuning.andP;  I think Herrick wanted to throw potential competitors offthe scent by making the PC business sound a whole lot easier than in fact itreally is.andM;Building a PC certainly doesn't qualify as a black art, but there's more toit than meets the eye.andP;  I recently toured the manufacturing facility ofanother direct marketer, Swan Technologies.andP;  While I was there, I chattedwith the engineers (I was attracted to their work area by the shelvesoverflowing with back issues of PC Magazine).andP;  They gave me an engineer's-eyeview of the process that begins when the &quot;finished&quot; motherboard and BIOSarrive.andP;  It's a time-consuming, exacting process of maximizing performance,testing for compatibility, and resolving hardware and software conflicts.andM;Swan's engineers clearly demonstrated that the time of building PCs withwhatever parts are cheapest is over.andP;  The compatibility issues simply taketoo long to resolve.andP;  Changing the components too frequently also raisesquestions about the manufacturer's ability to service and support themachine.andM;Then there's the ugly specter of FCC recertification.andP;  Changing the majorcomponents in the machine changes its RF emissions characteristics.andP;  So theFCC requires that the machine be retested.andP;  That adds thousands of dollars tothe cost and a couple of months to the date you can deliver the final productto a customer.andM;I've focused on the direct marketers here because in general they're muchfaster on their feet than the retail manufacturers.andP;  The latter buildcomputers for the channel; the former build them for the customer.andP;  Those whomanufacture for the retail channel have to build machines that thedistributors and dealers will buy, and retail manufacturers must build theirmachines in volume.andP;  The direct marketer takes your order, builds a machineaccording to your request, and ships it to you.andP;  So for the direct marketers,there is always the temptation to improve the next machine out the door withsome small change or another to bring it a step closer to the state of theart.andM;HANDCUFFED BY THE STANDARDandM;No matter how much PC manufacturers tweak their products, ultimately they'relimited by the IBM standard.andP;  The choices made in the first PC still dictatemuch of what manufacturers can do.andP;  DOS and application software are theother great levelers.andP;  How, then, do you distinguish one machine from therest?andP;  How do you make a good selection?andP;  Even starting from such similarpoints, manufacturers can still take machines in many different directions,tailoring them as file servers, graphics workstations, workaday machines, orhyperthyroid performance monsters.andP;  Look for innovation within thestandard--compatibility plus originality, at the price you want to pay, withthe features you need and the ones you're going to need.andM;Interestingly, manufacturers take compatibility for granted; customers assumeit to be conditional at best.andP;  In a recent focus group conducted by PCMagazine, directors and vice presidents of MIS agreed that &quot;nothing is reallycompatible with IBM.&quot;andP;  They're wrong, but that's the perception.andP;  Theseexecutives typically do not choose the brand of PC, and frankly, they have noidea what they're talking about technically.andP;  But you can't blame them.andO;Compatibility has come a long way over the years, but they've heard all theold horror stories.andM;BUYING THE RIGHT PCandM;Pay only for the performance that counts.andP;  Performance is an importantingredient in today's machines, but get the right features for the workyou'll be doing.andP;  Additional system memory increases total performance at alllevels.andP;  It's also the least expensive means of getting the most performanceout of a system.andP;  The memory can be used for disk caching, RAM disks,shadowing BIOS code, accommodating new versions of DOS and Windows, andgiving your users the flexibility to move up to OS/2 when it's time.andM;Most machines will never need caching disk controllers, graphics coprocessor,and math chips.andP;  The few that do can be upgraded at any time.andP;  Buy a 386SX,386, or 486.andP;  The staying power is in the instruction set.andP;  Be careful,however, not to make the machines you buy too generic.andP;  A 486 machine, forexample, can be preconfigured with a large hard disk, monochrome VGA, and aninternal UPS.andP;  It says &quot;file server.&quot;andP;  The same machine can be configuredwith a dedicated mouse port, a high-performance graphics card, and a 16- or19-inch monitor.andP;  Now it's telling you that it's a graphics workstation.andP;  Ifyou try to convert one into the other, you wind up with parts on the shelf oruseless components in the box.andM;Work with your accountants.andP;  The old depreciation rules never heard oftoday's computer technology.andP;  If a machine is a year old, it's obsolescent.andO;It's not obsolete, but it can't compete with this year's PCs in terms oflevels of integration and price performance.andP;  Look for every opportunity topass along last year's machine to someone new who can use its power.andP;  Acquirethe state of the art for those who'll benefit most from it.andP;  Buy up thetechnology curve, not down the price curve.andM;Herrick should have said, &quot;Anyone with a screwdriver and a brain can be a PCmanufacturer.&quot;andP;  The kind of machine that can be built with just a screwdriverisn't worth building.andP;  Or buying.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
