A decision to bar visitors is one of the ``daily managementproblems'' prison officials deal with that do not give rise to anyspecial rights for inmates, state lawyer Barbara Willett Jones ofFrankfort, Ky., argued.   But Joseph Elder II, a Louisville lawyer representing inmates,contended that Kentucky's prison visitation program created a``liberty interest'' for inmates that cannot be infringed on withoutdue process.   ``The right arises out of ... regulations in place,'' Elder said.   The high court is expected to announce a decision in the case byJuly. Its ruling likely will affect prison visitation policies inmany states.   Thirty-two other states are supporting Kentucky's appeal, urgingthe justices to clarify what rights, if any, inmates have in suchcases.   A federal appeals court ruled for the inmates, but did not saywhat kind of due process _ perhaps a written explanation or sometype of hearing _ is required when visits are prohibited.   The Kentucky controversy dates back to a lawsuit inmates of theKentucky State Reformatory in LaGrange filed over conditions there.   The suit resulted in a 1980 consent decree in which the stateagreed, among other things, to continue its ``open visitationpolicy.''   State officials subsequently adopted guidelines and proceduresfor handling prison visits.   In 1985, after several inmates complained about being barred fromhaving visitors, a class-action lawsuit was filed in behalf of allthe prison's inmates. The suit contended that suspension ofvisitation privileges without a due-process hearing was unlawful.   Mrs. Jones asked the justices to ``draw a line between thoseprocedures which affect the daily operations of a prison from thosewhich affect the length or nature of confinement'' when requiringstates to give inmates due process.   She said denial of visitation privileges does not rise to thelevel of affecting length or nature of confinement _ and thereforeshould not give rise to any due-process right.   Several members of the high court seemed dubious.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, noting that some might say seeingvisitors ``is vitally important to a prisoner's existence,'' saidthe distinction Mrs. Jones sought ``is not an easy line to draw.''   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist complained that ``your lineseems so wavy,'' and Justice Antonin Scalia asked, ``Is it a linethat makes any sense?''   When Justice John Paul Stevens asked whether providing inmateswith a written explanation for denied visitation would be a bigadministrative burden, Mrs. Jones said it would not.   But she said creation of such a due-process right would leave allprison officials open to civil rights lawsuits alleging violation ofthat right.   The case is Kentucky Department of Corrections vs. Thompson,87-1815.</TEXT></DOC>
