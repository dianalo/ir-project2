Israeli soldiers shot and wounded a 55-year-old Palestinianwoman in a clash today in the occupied Gaza Strip, an Arab reportersaid. She was shot in the hand in the Nusseirat refugee camp when amelee broke out as soldiers went to a school, said the reporter,speaking on condition of anonymity.   He said soldiers severely beat a 15-year-old boy in the clash.   A military spokesman said he was unaware of any disturbances inGaza or the West Bank. Israel army radio said the Nusseirat campand Bureij refugee camp, also in Gaza, were put under curfew.   Stores were closed and buses and most cars stayed off thestreets in the territories. In Gaza City, at least 15 burning tireswere blocking main roads and troops fired tear gas to clear awayprotesters, the Arab reporter.   Leaders of the 6-month-old Arab uprising called the strike toprotest the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz to theregion to promote a peace initiative.   Shultz arrived Friday in Cairo and was traveling to Jordan andSyria today and Israel on Sunday.   Major General Yitzhak Mordechai, who commands the Gaza area,appealed to residents to maintain calm during today's anniversaryof Israel's invasion of Lebanon, promising aid and relief to thosewho complied.   On Friday, soldiers and unidentified civilians shot twoPalestinians to death and wounded at least five other West BankArabs.   Since the beginning of the uprising Dec. 8, 201 Palestinians andtwo Israelis have died.   An Israeli army officer shot and killed a 26-year-old ArabFriday in Tzafa village near Ramallah, north of Jerusalem, afterunidentified Israeli civilians killed a 20-year-old man in Shuyukhvillage near Hebron.   The civilians also wounded three others in the incident,hospital officials in Hebron and police said.   ``Just before nightfall, a military patrol in the village wassurrounded and showered with rocks,'' an army spokesman said. ``Anofficer shot first in the air, but when he was in danger for hislife, he shot at the people's legs, and the 26-year-old waskilled.''   Israeli radio identified the dead man as Muhamad Ranen.   In a separate incident Friday, troops shot and wounded two Arabyouths after they blocked roads with rocks and threw stones at anarmy patrol in the market area of the West Bank city of Nablus.   The army maintained curfews and movement restrictions on about200,000 residents of the territories in order to squelch unrest.   Police said they suspected a group of four Jewish youths mayhave been involved in the killing of the Shuyukh man, identified asMustafa Ahmed Halaika.   An army spokesman said no soldiers were in the area when theshooting took place.   As Shultz launched the fourth round of his peace mission, PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir reiterated his staunch opposition to theAmerican plan to promote an international Middle East peaceconference.   Shamir insists on direct bilateral talks between Israel and itsArab neighbors.   His political rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, said he wasoptimistic about an international conference because of what hesaid were encouraging changes in Soviet attitudes.   A poll published Friday in the Hebrew daily Hadashot newspaperindicates Peres' left-of-center Labor party has gained inpopularity in recent months and could win 53 parliament seats inthe November elections, up from 50 in March.   Maj. Gen. Mordechai used the platform of Israeli television'sArabic service to appeal to Gaza Strip residents to ignore today'sanniversary as well as the Sunday anniversary of the 1967 Six DayWar, when Israel captured the land.   He promised to lift curfews and release prisoners if residentsreturned to ``life, work, trade and school.''   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he would release 120teen-age boys from prison Sunday as a gesture of goodwill.</TEXT></DOC>
