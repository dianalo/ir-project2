It insisted the agreement did not mean Britain was paying ``aprice for better relations.''   Iran is to net nearly $2 million in the deal, which ForeignOffice officials and Mohammed Besti, the Iranian charge d'affairesin London, completed Tuesday after three weeks of negotiations, aForeign Office spokesman said.   Observers speculated that Iran's willingness to negotiatesignaled a desire to improve its relations with Britain, which wereseverely strained last year when a British diplomat was beaten upin Tehran and London withdrew its staff.   The spokesman said Britain will pay Iran $3.4 million incompensation for damaging the Iranian Embassy in London, whichBritish commandos stormed and gutted in 1980 to free hostages heldby opponents of the Iranian government.   Iran will pay Britain $1.67 million dollars for damage caused bycrowds to the British Embassy in Tehran following the seizure ofthe American Embassy and its staff in 1979, the spokesman said.   The spokesman, who requested anonymity, denied the compensationwas aimed at freeing British hostages in Lebanon.   ``You should not look at this agreement in the context of ustrying to pay a price for better relations with the Iranians,'' hesaid. ``We have said we want better relations with Iran. It is animportant country.''   The deal was announced only two days after Iran severelycriticized Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's refusal to condemnthe United States for downing an Iranian airliner over the PersianGulf.   The United States said its forces mistook the civilian jetlinerfor an Iranian jet fighter.</TEXT></DOC>
