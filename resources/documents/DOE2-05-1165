One objective of these systemshas been to attempt to enhance decision effectiveness by allowing usersto preferentially seek information, thereby facilitating the reductionor elimination of information overload. These systems do not necessarilylead to more-effective decision making, however. Recent research in information-searchstrategy suggests that when users are seeking information subsequentto forming initial beliefs, they may preferentially seek informationto confirm these beliefs. It seems that effective computer-based decisionsupport requires an information retrieval system capable of: (a) retrievinga subset of all available information, in order to reduce informationoverload, and (b) supporting an information search strategy that considersall relevant information, rather than merely hypothesis-confirming information.An information retrieval system with an expert component (i.e., a knowledge-basedDSS) should be able to provide these capabilities. Results of this studyare non conclusive; there was neither strong confirmatory evidence norstrong disconfirmatory evidence regarding the effectiveness of the KBDSS.</TEXT></DOC>
