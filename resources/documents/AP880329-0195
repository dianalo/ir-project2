The decision came shortly before the Democratic-controlled panelvoted 48-4 approval of a bill authorizing the Pentagon to spend$299 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.   The overall Pentagon budget had been set in December duringnegotiations between the White House and Congress over a budgetdeficit reduction package.   The panel slashed to $3.7 billion Reagan's request for $4.5billion in Star Wars funds.   The panel also voted to approve $500 million for research intoputting the MX aboard trains, $300 million less than Reagan hadsought. At the same time, the panel increased Reagan's request forspending on the single-warhead Midgetman missile from $200 millionto $500 million.   As it worked on the bill, the committee also:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Voted 43-8 to spend $1.4 billion for a new Trident submarineinstead of using the money for two more Aegis-class destroyers.That vote reversed a decision last week by the seapowersubcommittee.   _Voted 46-6 to permit the United States to sell Aegis-classdestroyers to Japan, as long as Reagan certifies that the system isprotected against espionage. Aegis is the Navy's secret, high-techdefense system for ships and the administration is consideringselling four of the $1.2 billion ships to Japan.   The Star Wars decision confirmed the budget choice made lastweek by the Armed Services research and development subcommittee,and will result in a deep reduction from original plans. The $3.7billion figure would mean that Star Wars spending next year wouldremain at about the current level.   Last year, Pentagon budget plans called for seeking $6.2 billionin Star Wars money for fiscal 1989, but that was reduced to the$4.5 billion level by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci as partof a package of reductions he ordered in response to a WhiteHouse-congressional agreement in December that set next year'sdefense budget at $299 billion.   That agreement has calmed the congressional debate about defensespending, but opened new fights about how to best allocate theoverall total.   The $3.7 billion figure for the Strategic Defense Initiative, asStar Wars is known formally, was approved Tuesday after thecommittee was unable to agree on four other proposed SDI amountsranging from $3.1 billion up to the full $4.5 billion figure.   The committee later voted to overturn a decision by the researchand development subcommittee which had halved the Pentagon's SDIbudget request for research into an interceptor rocket that wouldbe used to slam into Soviet nuclear missiles at high speed todestroy them.   Known as the Space-Based Interceptor, the program is consumingan increasingly large share of the Pentagon's SDI budget. Plansnext year call for spending $330 million on that program, but thesubcommittee had cut that in half because of fears that thetechnology is not as promising as other weapons that could be partof a defensive shield.   The dispute over the Midgetman and the MX involves a pair ofnuclear weapons that have been central to a seven-year-old fightover Reagan's plans for building up America's nuclear arsenal.   Congress has approved building 50 of the MX weapons fordeployment in land-based silos, but the Pentagon is now seeking 50more of the weapons and plans call for putting the second 50 aboardtrains. Meantime, the Pentagon has been lukewarm toward theMidgetman, a weapon that has been a favorite of congressionalcritics of the MX.   Carlucci told Congress last month that he thought the Midgetmanshould be eliminated, but said he had included $200 million at therequest of Congress so the program could be kept alive untilReagan's successor makes a decision next year.   Meantime, Carlucci said $800 million should be spent forresearch into the rail-based version of the 10-warhead MX.   The research and development subcommittee said last week thateach weapon should be given $500 million and that subcommitteedecision was ratified Tuesday after several unsuccessful attemptsto change it.</TEXT></DOC>
