The General Accounting Office concluded in its report thatalthough the Air Force has made progress in correcting certaindeficiencies in the Rockwell-built bomber, problems in the bomber'sperformance persist.   ``Several areas critical to B-1B's mission performance have notyet been demonstrated,'' the report said.   The review also said the cost of the Air Force plane could be upto $400 million each if the service goes ahead with all the plannedimprovements.   Those problems mean the B-1B may not have the range it wasdesigned to have or be able to carry all the bombs and missilesplanned for it, the report said.   The bomber is designed to carry conventional and nuclear gravitybombs, cruise missiles and short-range attack missiles.   Specifically, the report said the Air Force has not made progressin resolving problems with the B-1B's defensive avionics. ``Inshort, it is now known that the defensive avionics cannot meetspecifications without a major redesign,'' the report said.   The defensive avionics, or electronic countermeasures system, wasdesigned to improve the bomber's probability of penetrating theSoviet Union by allowing the aircraft's crew to ``avoid, degrade anddeceive the Soviet air defenses,'' the report said.   The problems involve the system's radar warning receiver andprocessor function.   The report also said that data for the bomber indicate thatreported fuel leaks have for the most part remained the same overthe last year. Elimination of the fuel leaks is probably notpossible, according to the report, which noted that the fuel cellsare part of the airframe and seals and joints are subjected toflight stress.   The B-1, killed by then-President Carter in 1977, was resurrectedfour years later by former President Reagan, who said 100 of theswing-wing planes were needed to update the nation's aging force ofnuclear-armed bombers.   Reagan ordered 100 of the planes, at a cost of $20.5 billion.Three have crashed, leaving the service with 97 B-1Bs. The Air Forcehas already received all the B-1s it intends to buy and is nowproceeding with plans to buy the radar-evading B-2 stealth bomber.</TEXT></DOC>
