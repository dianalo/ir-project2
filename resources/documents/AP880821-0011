The fairs still feature Ferris wheels and funhouses, midwaycrowds of farmers in coveralls, girls in summer dresses, swarms ofeager kids _ and traditional summer fare like corn on the cob,butterfly porkchop sandwiches, cotton candy and snow cones.   But it's not the same.   ``You don't feel like eating,'' said Don Carlson, 66, ofBelvidere, at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield. ``You wantsomething, but you don't.''   ``And the ice cream melts so fast,'' said his wife, Vi.   The parched, hot summer that has turned city lawns brown andurbanites crabby has been a disaster for the Midwest, where growersgrimly contemplate shriveled fields in autumn colors and deep cutsin projected grain harvests.   At the fairgrounds, it makes for smaller produce and livestock _and even some casualties.   On Tuesday, when the temperature hit 102 degrees inIndianapolis, ``there were four fatals in the poultry division, andthey were chickens,'' said Indiana State Fair spokesman JeffFisher. The owners, he noted, had left their entries in cars ``withthe windows rolled up.''   By Thursday, five rabbits, two hogs and eight chickens died fromthe 97-degree heat, and livestock exhibitors were taking extraprecautions to keep their animals comfortable in fairground barns.   ``They're packing some down with ice, they're putting ice infront of fans to blow cool air,'' Fisher said. ``They're coming upwith some ingenious ways to handle the heat stress.''   Although state fairs in the heartland traditionally drawmillions of people each year, attendance is down somewhat thissummer in some states.   Fairgoers cheer or challenge in contests ranging fromhorse-racing to horseshoes, from husband-calling to hog-calling.   They relax with rock music and symphonies; they scrutinizeblue-ribbon displays of produce or livestock or home crafts; theyride the rides or line up to try the midway games of skill for pinkpandas or funny hats; they inspect displays of new farm machinery.   Some forget their troubles _ for the moment.   ``It is a time that you can just go and forget all about thecorn ... or other headaches that you have,'' said Dana Trimble,manager of a company that grows seed corn. Trimble plays drums andhis farmer father, Gene, plays trumpet with a band of strollingplayers _ in clown gear _ at the Illinois fairgrounds every year.   ``People kind of want to get away from the farm. It's been atough year,'' said John E. Ward, board president for the Indianafair.   At the 18-day Ohio State Fair in Columbus, which drew 3.5million last year, attendance was down 7 percent for the first 12days. Free tickets went out to some drought-stricken farmers tosquelch rumors of cancellation.   Missouri State Fair director Bill Waddell said rain would helpthe state reach its goal of 350,000 visitors to the 11-day fairthat ends Aug. 28 at Sedalia _ with air-conditioning for indooractivities.   Relentless hot weather ``could hurt us, but it always seems torain during the fair,'' Waddell said.   Officials of the Michigan State Fair, which begins its 140th runFriday, said entries were down only slightly.   ``We've set aside an area with a large tent and nice cool waterand lemonade,'' said fair manager Bernie Lennon. ``It will be alittle oasis.''   Officials at the Iowa State Fair were optimistic aboutattendance as the fair began its 11-day run Thursday. Butch Webb ofWichita, Kan., working in 104-degree heat Wednesday to prepare thefairgrounds, said that while this summer was ``a little bitextreme, I don't remember setting up ... and not being covered withsweat.''   Spokeswoman Kathie Swift recalled a 108-degree reading at Iowa's1983 fair.   The Wisconsin State Fair, which ended Aug. 14 at West Allis,drew 821,819 people _ down nearly 6 percent from last year.   The Kentucky State Fair, which began Thursday, has 14 acres ofair-conditioned space, said spokeswoman Brenda Frank, who predictedthat teen-agers would be outdoors on the midway, whatever theweather.   ``I don't think they know how hot it is,'' she said. ``We won'ttell them that.''   The too-hot, too-dry growing season was a disappointment forsome produce exhibitors, who ruefully displayed unusually smallcontenders.   Tony Misich of Clinton, Ohio, said the potatoes, cucumbers,peppers and onions are the smallest from his garden he's shown in10 years at the fair.   ``This is sure disappointing _ you're not a-kiddin','' he said.   Flowers also suffered.   In Wisconsin, dahlia entries were down 50 percent, said fairspokeswoman Julie Carlson.   ``Those flowers were not out there blooming,'' she said. ``Wedid have a lot of ribbons left over.''</TEXT></DOC>
