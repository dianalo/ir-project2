(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Navy said Wednesday it hoped tofind and correct the cause of a Trident 2 missile explosion in timeto fire the next missile in April and complete a series of submarinetests by year's end.   The Navy's goal is to have the long-range missile operational byDecember. That goal could be jeopardized if the problem is not foundquickly, but a Navy statement said it would be premature to suggestthe missile would not be ready for deployment then.   ``We don't know if there will be a setback or how much of a oneuntil we know the cause of Tuesday's failure and how much correctiveaction has to be taken,'' said Lt. Jim Wood, a Navy spokesman.   ``Right now our plan is to launch eight more, starting inApril,'' he said. ``Our plan is to have the system operational inDecember 1989.''   The first submarine launch of the Navy's newest and most powerfulweapon ended in fiery failure shortly after one of the 44-footmissiles vaulted out of tube in the deck of the submerged USSTennessee and shot to the surface. The first stage ignited and theprojectile immediately spun like a burning pinwheel and explodedfour seconds after launch about 100 feet above the Atlantic Ocean.   A Navy statement said an unknown malfunction caused the unarmed$23.7 million missile to veer off course and self-destruct. It saidno damage was done to the submarine or nearby support ships.   Divers recovered the nose section and other parts, wreckage thatcould help in the investigation of what went wrong, authorities said.   Wood said investigators also were analyzing the four seconds ofradioed flight data and videotapes of the explosion, ``but noresults have come out of the review yet. We have no firm ideas.''   Navy officials at the Pentagon who spoke on condition ofanonymity said the failure appeared to involve a malfunction in thefirst-stage rocket motor.   ``But we have no idea at this point just what went wrong,'' saidone official. ``It will take a while to sort through the data.''   The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weaponthat is the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent. It candeliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets up to6,000 miles away.   The Tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry24 of the deadly missiles.   The Navy said it was disappointed with the failure, but added,``It is through this type of developmental test program that youiron out problems.''   The Trident 2's predecessor, the Trident 1, experienced similartest failures but still was deployed on schedule, the Navy said.   The Navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than itsundersea predecessors _ Polaris, Poseidon and Trident 1 _ and canmatch the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it islaunched from a submerged, moving submarine.   Tuesday's launch from the Tennessee was preceded by what the Navycalled a highly successful series of test firings from a land launchpad at Cape Canaveral, dating to January 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
