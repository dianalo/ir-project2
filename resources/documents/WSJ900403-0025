The yen was hurt as Tokyo markets put in anothertumultuous performance. Increasingly public German quarrelsover monetary union sapped the mark, and a weekend riot inLondon over a new community tax weakened the pound.</LP><TEXT>   But despite some sharp moves higher during the day, theU.S. unit finished the global day with only modest advancesagainst most of its major counterparts. Some dealers saidcaution ahead of a meeting scheduled for Saturday of theGroup of Seven leading industrial nations took the wind outof the dollar's sails.   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quotedat 1.7009 marks, up from 1.6940 marks late Friday, and at158.95 yen, up from 158.35 yen late Friday. Sterling wasquoted at $1.6348, down from $1.6455 Friday.   At midmorning in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was trading atabout 159.03 yen, off from 159.10 yen at the opening and downfrom Monday's Tokyo close of 159.95 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S.currency was trading at about 1.7015 marks, up slightly fromthe opening quote of 1.7013 marks, and up from Monday's Tokyoclose of 1.6983 marks.   On Monday in Tokyo, traders said dollar buying byinstitutional investors for the new fiscal year and anewspaper article saying that Japanese insurance companiesare planning heavy sales of their stock holdings pushed theU.S. unit sharply higher early in the day, before it gaveback some ground on profit-taking and Bank of Japan dollarsales.   Early in Tokyo, the dollar shot to 160.30 yen, itsintraday high. Surprised by the speed of the move,participants began to take profits, dragging the U.S. unitlower.   The Bank of Japan joined in with intervention estimated bytraders to have involved $300 million to $500 million.   Later, in Europe and the U.S., the dollar surged on areport that the East German central bank opposed the WestGerman central bank's plan that monetary union involve anexchange rate of two East German marks for one West Germanmark for all but the first 2,000 East German marks in savingsaccounts. For those 2,000 East German marks, the rate wouldbe one-for-one.   The East German criticism followed a flurry of conflictingcomments by West German politicians on the monetary union.West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, who hadendorsed the West German central bank's two-for-one plan overthe weekend, told the Bild newspaper in an interviewscheduled to be published Tuesday that politicians willdecide the exchange rate, not the West German central bank.The comments to Bild appeared to indicate that Mr. Haussmannwas distancing himself from the West German central bank'splan.   Sterling fell as soon as trading opened in Asia. Weekendriots in the United Kingdom over the poll tax that tookeffect Sunday in England and Wales have raised questionsabout the durability of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.   The yen is being hurt by the failure of the Bank of Japanand the Japanese Ministry of Finance to agree on a monetarypolicy, and by the massive outflows of capital from Japan totake advantage of the relatively cheaper prices of realestate and assets elsewhere, said Sung Won Sohn, chiefeconomist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.   The turmoil in Japanese markets was underlined againyesterday by a plunge of 1,978.38 points in the Nikkei stockindex, to 28,002.07 points.   Talk of another interest rate increase in Japan, less thantwo weeks after the Bank of Japan boosted the discount rateto 5.25% from 4.25%, was cited as the cause of a sell-off ofthe dollar in afternoon trading in New York. The discountrate is the central bank's base rate on loans to commercialbanks.   Despite pessimism over the yen, dealers are also wary ofpushing it too low ahead of the meeting scheduled Saturday ofthe Group of Seven industrial nations. Although most don'texpect the G-7 to agree on a way to defend the Japanese unit,they don't want to put too much money on that expectation.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $369.80 an ounce, down 40 cents fromFriday. Estimated volume was a light 1.9 million ounces.   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold opened for trading at $370.55an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
