While many citizens accept the need for governmentregulation to protect against market failures, or against the normaloperation of the market where endowments are highly unequal, there isstill plenty of controversy over the type and extent of regulation thatis really necessary or desirable. One characteristic of the recent debatehas been to focus on the potential benefits of deregulation, especiallyin industries where regulation may have been imposed in such a way asto reduce competition or innovation. Thus, in the late 1970s, a numberof proposals for deregulation were put forth for airlines, trucking,telecommunications, and, not least in importance, the domestic pricesof petroleum and natural gas. While there is a growing literature ofthe effects of deregulation, there are not many rigorous quantitativestudies in the energy field of this topic. Part of the problem, of course,is the difficulty of establishing quantitative measures of variableswhich adequately reflect energy policy and program outcomes. This studyfocuses only on the effects of the deregulation of petroleum prices ondependency on imported petroleum. The authors might also have examinedthe effects of deregulation on competitiveness in the petroleum industryor on prices of petroleum products. However, for this article, it isintended simply to present empirical evidence on the relationship betweengovernment oil price deregulation and petroleum dependency in the UnitedStates.</TEXT></DOC>
