Effects of researchon equipment reliability on cost of research, development and manufacturingof control equipment are analyzed. Curves showing manufacturing costare plotted. Computer programs developed by the EMAG Mine AutomationCompany for calculating reliability coefficients are discussed. Two systemsare described: the RELI system for calculating reliability coefficientsand the BION system for reliability assessment. The BION system consistsof 3 subsystems (modules): data base of equipment reliability, reliabilityanalysis, optimum structures of reliability. Prospects for wide use ofcomputerized methods for reliability assessment of control equipmentin the light of technology development are evaluated. Reliability of34 types of control equipment used in underground coal mines in Poland(for control of communication equipment, mine haulage, explosive fracturingand ventilation system) is analyzed. Two indices are given: the meanfailure-free operation time and probability of failure-free operationduring a period of 30 days. 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
