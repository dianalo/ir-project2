The thermal neutron activation device, or TNA, as it is called, costs $1 million, is big and bulky, emits radiation and can be set off by a salami.    &quot;TNA, as such, we think is too big, too slow, too heavy, too costly,&quot; says Richard Lally, vice president for security at the Air Transport Association, a trade group for U.S. air carriers. &quot;But,&quot; he adds, &quot;it does detect bombs.&quot;    Earlier this month, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed requiring airlines to purchase and install updated bomb-detecting equipment in airports in the U.S. and abroad in an effort to combat terrorism. TNA, developed by Scientific Applications International Corp. of San Diego, Calif., is the only bomb-detection device in the production stage that is capable of handling airport baggage volume. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner has hailed the first-of-its-kind device as &quot;the highest degree of explosion detection currently possible.&quot;    The FAA, which has poured $15 million into developing TNA, has bought six units to use in U.S. airports and one foreign airport. The first is expected to be installed at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport by next month. Gatwick International in London is scheduled to receive a TNA unit in September.    The FAA pinpointed 40 &quot;high risk&quot; airports here and abroad where U.S. air carriers will be required to install TNA or comparable bomb-detection devices. The agency estimates that 400 units will be needed to provide adequate security at those locations. The airlines will have to pay for most of the new security systems beyond those first six units.    The large number of machines is necessary because it takes about six seconds for the bulky machine to scan a bag. Airports with large baggage volume -- Kennedy Airport processes 76,000 bags for international destinations daily -- will need numerous machines to keep baggage moving and avoid flight delays, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association says.    TNA works by bombarding objects with neutrons that detect concentrations of the nitrogen compounds found in all plastic explosives. When the chemical compound is present, an alarm sounds and the questionable bag is automatically removed from the system's main flow.    Bombs, however, aren't the only things that will set off TNA's alarm. Other highly nitrogenous material such as salami or a hunk of cheese could trigger an alert. These possibilities mean a 4% false-alarm rate, or an average of 20 bags per widebody flight. The FAA, though, isn't concerned. &quot;You are going to have a certain false-alarm rate with any machine,&quot; says Fred Farrar, an agency spokesman.    Another glitch, according to a report prepared for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is that the TNA unit leaves some items such as gold and salty foods slightly radioactive. Also, employees working near the machine risk radiation exposure equal to that of workers in a conventional nuclear facility, the report said. &quot;There are very clearly concerns about people being exposed&quot; to radiation, says Art Kosatka, director of technical services for the Airport Operators Council International Inc., an aviation-industry trade group.    But Hadi Bozorgmanesh, a Scientific Applications vice president, says radiation emitted from TNA is small and below acceptable federal standards.    TNA has been tested briefly at airports in San Francisco and Los Angeles at the FAA's request, and some aviation officials question if those trials were adequate.    &quot;We want to make sure the systems we are putting in are going to meet the desired effect,&quot; says Spencer Dickerson, vice president of the Airport Executives Association, a group representing top airport officials. Mr. Dickerson says his group is already concerned that airlines have to shoulder the cost of new anti-terrorism equipment when acts of terrorism are generally directed at government policy.    Other bomb-detecting devices are under development. Close behind TNA in the race is Thermedics Inc. with a device that &quot;sniffs out&quot; explosives.    There are two versions: a hand-held version for luggage, and a walk-through type for passengers. SecurScan, the people scanner, has been contracted by the FAA, and so far $4 million has gone into its development. But company officials estimate it will be another two years before the device goes into production.    The hand-held version, called Egis, is at the production stage. The State Department, concerned with the safety of U.S. embassies and military bases, invested $7.1 million for the development of Egis. The units, costing $125,000, have a relatively slow scan time of 15 seconds per bag. Because of that pace, the FAA has shown only lukewarm interest in using the device in the U.S., but seven systems have been ordered by foreign companies for airports abroad, Thermedics says.    Thermedics officials are pushing the Egis in airports as a complement to the TNA system. David Fine, a company vice president, says using both devices would greatly increase the chances of bomb detection. &quot;Neither is going to solve the problem&quot; alone, he says. &quot;You need both.&quot;    Egis could well end up in U.S. airports as a back-up system for the TNA, says Lowel Malotky, an FAA security-development official. The effect, he says, would be like &quot;wearing a belt with suspenders.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
