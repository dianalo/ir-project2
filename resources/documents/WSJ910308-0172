One wouldhave to read something other than the Journal's editorialpage to know what environmentalists are up to.   Greenpeace denounced Iraq's intentional spilling of oilshortly after it happened. Greenpeace also condemned Iraq'saggression, long before the oil spilling began. While SaddamHussein reached a new moral low in the intentional spillingof oil and the torching of oil fields, the environmentalimpacts of these deeds will not match the damage done bydecades-long use and waste of fossil fuels. Oil was at theroot of every aspect of the Persian Gulf War. U.S.involvement was clearly a function of our national dependencyon fossil fuels. For its part, Iraq's war machine is built onoil revenues, in addition to direct Western financial andtechnical aid.</LP><TEXT>   While Mr. Weidenbaum questions our consistency, I suspectthat his concern over &quot;the pictures of dying cormorants&quot; isboth unprecedented and artificial. Where is his indignationwhen our own country unveils an energy policy that virtuallyguarantees the next oil war?   Greenpeace has not &quot;ignored&quot; the &quot;deliberate pollution bytotalitarian regimes.&quot; To the contrary, we have launched anambitious and costly program to help protect the ravagedenvironment of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.Greenpeace's history of confronting Soviet environmentaldestruction dates back to 1975.   Peter Bahouth   Executive Director   Greenpeace USA   Washington   ---   The World Society for the Protection of Animals is workingon Gulf oil-spill fouling now.
