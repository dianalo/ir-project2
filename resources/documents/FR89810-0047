The FDDI is a layered standard for a 100 Mbitsfiber optic token ring Local Area Network (LAN). The FDDI network willallow up to 500 stations connected by up to 200 km of fiber, and is particularlysuited as a ``backbone'' network interconnecting other, lower data-rateLANs, for applications inherently requiring high bandwidth, such as imageprocessing with engineering workstations, and connecting storage serversto powerful computers, and other applications whose size and data transferrequirements exceed the capacity of other LANs.  Prior to the submission of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commercefor review and approval, it is essential to assure that consideration isgiven to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and State andlocal governments. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views. This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section,which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation,and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section whichdeals with the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcementsection of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested partiesmay obtain copies of the published technical specifications ANSI X3.139-1987,FDDI Medium Access Control (MAC), and ANSI X3.148-1988, FDDI Physical LayerProtocol (PHY), from: American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 1430Broadway, New York, NY 10018 (212) 642-4900.

FDDI is a layered standardfor a 100 Mbits fiber optic token ring Local Area Network (LAN). The defaultconfiguration of FDDI allows up to 500 stations connected by as much as200 km of fiber. This network is particularly suited as a ``backbone''network interconnecting other, lower data-rate LANs, for applications inherentlyrequiring high bandwidth, such as image processing with engineering workstations,and connecting storage servers to powerful computers, and other applicationswhose size and data transfer requirements exceed the capacity of otherLANs.The FDDI standard covers the Physical Layer and lower portion of the DataLink Layer of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) reference Model. Itsupports the DIS 88012 Logical Link Control (LLC) Standard, and fits withinthe framework of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP),FIPS 146, as one of several lower layer standards supporting LLC. In addition to supporting the application specified by GOSIP, FDDI is expectedto be widely used for applications which are not yet included in GOSIPor which inherently are not ``open'' applications. An example would beintra-system communications within a loosely coupled multiprocessor system.Both OSI and non-OSI applications may coexist on the same FDDI LAN. FDDI is a layered standard consisting of four distinct parts: (a) Medium Access Control (MAC) which provides frame delivery servicesto the Logical Link Control (LLC) Sublayer above it. LLC is not a partof FDDI. MAC specifies the format of FDDI frames and the token passingmedium access protocol. (b) Physical Layer Protocol (PHY) which provides code word delivery servicesto the MAC sublayer above it. It is responsible for encoding, decodingand clock recovery functions. (c) Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) which provides code bit delivery servicesto the PHY sublayer above it via fiber optic transmission to other PMDentities. Two alternative versions of PMD are defined, one using multimodeoptical fibers to connect stations separated by less than 2 km, and theother using single mode fiber capable of connecting stations separatedby 50 km or more. The multimode version of FDDI is the normal case. (d) Station Management (SMT) supervises the MAC, PHY and PMD layers andcontrols the initialization and configuration of the FDDI network, as wellas the isolation and resolution of faults. It further provides managementservices to the OSI Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) for remotemanagement. While FDDI is a token ring, it supports a complex topology called a ``dualring of trees,'' which combines both the dual counter-rotating ring andthe ring concentrator strategies for bypassing failures. Four classes ofstations are defined: (a) Dual Attachment Stations (DAS) which are connected to other ``peer''DAS to form a dual counter rotating ring. (b) Single Attachment Stations (SAS) which are connected to the FDDI networkas ``slaves'' through concentrators. (c) Dual Attachment Concentrations (DAC) which are a DAS with a numberof ``master'' ports to which SAS may be connected. Concentrators will bypassdefective or inactive slaves. (d) Single Attachment Concentrators (SAC) which are SAS and attach as aslave to the master ports of other concentrators, in turn providing a numberof master ports to a lower level of slaves. This permits a tree structureof concentrators, with SAS at the terminal leaves. 4. <T3>Approving Authority. </T3>Secretary of Commerce. 5. <T3>Maintenance Agency. </T3>U.S. Department of Commerce, National Instituteof Standards and Technology, National Computer Systems Laboratory. 6. <T3>Cross Index</T3>.(a) IS 9314:-1:1989 Information process systems_Fiber Distributed DataInterface (FDDI)_Part 1: Physical Layer Protocol (PHY) requirements.

Unless specifically stated otherwise, multimode PMD is understoodto be specified. Although FDDI stations may work with other types of multimodefiber, they have been developed for use with the type of Fiber specifiedin FED-STD-1070, which should normally be specified when installing fibercable plants for use with FDDI.X3.XXX-19XX specifies a single mode fiber medium, and is used, as required,whenever link distances exceed 2 km, and can provide for links exceeding50 km.Since ring networks are made by chaining point-to-point connections, itis normal for both physical medium standards to be employed in the samenetwork, depending upon the distance of individual links. Similarly, itis normal for a dual attachment (2 port) FDDI station to have one portof each kind.In addition, when FDDI is used for Open System Interconnections (OSI) applications,the above American National Standards will be supplemented by the <T3>Stable Agreements for Open System Interconnection Protocols,</T3> whichis updated periodically. The current version of this publication is NISTSpecial Publication 500-162, which does not include additional requirementsfor FDDI. NBSIR 88-3824-2 contains proposed implementation agreements forFDDI, MAC, PHY and PMD, which are expected to be included in the next revisionof the <T3>Stable Agreements for Open System Interconnection Protocols.</T3> Implementationagreements for FDDI SMT are expected to be included in a later revisionto the <T3>Stable Agreements for Open System Interconnection Protocols.</T3> Theseagreements will provide additional specifications for FDDI which selectoptions from the FDDI standards and impose some additional requirements.When implementation agreements for FDDI are included in the current revisionto the <T3>Stable Agreements for Open System Interconnection Protocols,</T3> theyshall be a requirement of this FIPS whenever FDDI is used for applicationswithin the scope of Open Systems Interconnection. See FIPS PUB 146, GovernmentOpen Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP) for further information onthese agreements.FDDI may be used for special applications which are not within the scopeof Open System Interconnection and do not fall under GOSIP. In these cases,requirements of the <T3>Stable Agreements for Open System Interconnection Protocols</T3> maynot be appropriate and agencies may choose not to require the observanceof some or all of their provisions.10. <T3>Applicability.</T3> FDDI shall be used by Federal agencies when acquiringfiber optic token ring computer Local Area Network products having a datatransfer rate over 50 Mbits and less than 150 Mbits. The applicabilityincludes, but is not limited to applications covered by the GovernmentOpen Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), Federal Information ProcessingStandards Publication 146.11. <T3>Implementation.</T3> This standard is effective six (6) months afterapproval. Agencies are encouraged to use this standard for solicitationsand contracts for new fiber optic ring computer Local Area Networks tobe acquired after the effective date. This standard is compulsory and bindingfor use in solicitations and contracts for fiber optic token ring computerLocal Area Networks to be acquired two (2) years after the effective date.The National Institute of Standards and Technology is developing a programto accredit testing organizations for specific tests or types of testsfor computer products and services. Information on these tests and testprocedures will be made available in the future. Until the tests and testprocedures are available, government agencies acquiring networks and servicesin accordance with this standard may wish to require testing for conformance,interoperation, and performance. The tests to be administered and the testingorganization are at the discretion of the agency Acquisition Authority.Guidance on testing for GOSIP specifications is contained in section 2of the GOSIP document.12. <T3>Waivers.</T3> Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads ofFederal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal InformationProcessing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate suchauthority only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b)of Title 44, United States Code.Requests for waivers shall be granted only when:(a) Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishmentof the mission of an operator of a Federal computer system, or(b) Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is notoffset by Government-wide savings.Agency heads may approve requests for waivers only by a written decisionwhich explains the basis upon which the agency head made the required finding(s).A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classifiedportions clearly identified, shall be sent to: Director, National ComputerSystems Laboratory, ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, RoomB-154, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD20899. In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation ofauthority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committee onGovernment Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committeeon Governmental Affairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>.When the determination on a waiver request applies to the procurement ofequipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must bepublished in the <T3>Commerce Business Daily</T3> as a part of the notice of solicitationfor offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made afterthat notice is published, by amendment to such notice.A copy of the waiver request, any supporting documents, the document approvingthe waiver request and any supporting accompanying documents, with suchdeletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C.Sec. 552(b), shall be part of the procurement documentation and retainedby the agency.13. <T3>Where to Obtain Copies.</T3> Copies of this publication are for saleby the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), U.S. Department ofCommerce, Springfield, VA 22161.
