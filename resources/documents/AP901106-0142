The statement, made at a conference of South African churchleaders, was not an official church confession. But the theologian,Willie Jonker, said he felt he could speak for himself as well asthe Dutch Reformed Church.   Jonker went before conference delegates and said, ``I confessbefore you and before the Lord, not only my sin and guilt and mypersonal responsibility and structural wrongs that have been doneto many of you ... but vicariously I dare also to do that in thename of the (Dutch Reformed Church) of which I am a member.''   The Dutch Reformed Church is the main church of the Afrikaners,the Dutch-descended whites who dominate the government. It hasbranches for whites, blacks and people of mixed race and has beenisolated in South Africa for its support of segregation.   The black and mixed-race branches oppose apartheid. The whitebranch has backed off its argument of past decades that the Biblesupports apartheid, but it has not confessed to the sin ofapartheid. It also has not moved to merge with the other churchbranches.   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu accepted Jonker's confession.``The confession is not cheaply made, and my response is notcheaply made,'' he told applauding delegates.   Nearly 300 delegates from about 90 churches are attending theconference at Rustenburg, 62 miles northwest of Johannesburg. Themeeting has brought together churches long divided by apartheidthat now hope to reach agreement on the role of the church in afuture South Africa.   Two small churches that support apartheid, the AfrikaansProtestant Church and the Reformed Church, declined to attend.</TEXT></DOC>
