But the project was taking so long that he joked that it would never be finished. In the meantime, Mr. Menendez snapped up a $4 million Beverly Hills mansion, with six bedrooms, six baths and a tennis court.    There, the Cuban-born executive, the chairman and chief executive of Live Entertainment Inc., lived with his wife, Kitty, and two sons, 21-year-old Lyle and 18-year-old Eric. To help decorate, Kitty bought a Frederic Remington sculpture of a horse bucking a cowboy. &quot;It was one big happy family,&quot; says John E. Mason, a friend and a Live Entertainment director.    Then, late Sunday evening, the couple were found riddled with bullets in the family's den. There was no sign of burglary. Instead, say people familiar with the investigation, it appears that two assailants walked into the home and opened fire.    The murder sent shock waves through Hollywood and through Carolco Pictures Inc., the movie production company that helped to build Live Entertainment and owns 49% of it. No reason has emerged why anyone would murder Mr. Menendez, a hard-driving but well-respected entertainment executive, or his wife. But given the brutality of the crime -- a coroner's investigator called it a hit -- questions have arisen about a possible organized-crime connection to the murders.    Investigators are tight-lipped, so any such connection remains a matter of conjecture. Nevertheless, there is material to fuel such speculation, and there are other mysterious circumstances surrounding the strange case as well.    To begin with, Live Entertainment, a publicly held audio and video distributor and retailer, had just completed the purchase of a company that allegedly had ties to organized-crime figures.    Three years ago, Carolco bought one of Live's divisions from another man with reputed organized-crime links.    And in what may only be a strange coincidence, full-page ads ran in Sunday papers in Los Angeles and New York announcing the opening of &quot;Wired,&quot; a controversial film about the late comedian and drug-user John Belushi. Its producers claim powerful Hollywood executives have tried to prevent the film from opening. Live Entertainment had bought the home video rights and made a $4 million advance on the video contract, which helped fund distribution costs. But the day after the killing, several theater chains canceled commitments to show the picture in Los Angeles and New York.    A spokesman for Taurus Entertainment Co., the distributor, explains that &quot;it was a bizarre situation. The usual support didn't materialize.&quot; The theaters didn't give any reason for the cancellations, he says.    To compound the confusion, Carolco confirmed on the day after the killings that Andrew Vajna, one of its co-chairmen, was negotiating the sale of his 36% stake to Mario Kassar, the other co-chairman, for about $110 million after a 13-year partnership. One official close to the company says Mr. Vajna is going through a divorce and wants to spend more time in his native Hungary, but a company spokesman also says the divorce isn't a significant factor. Neither Mr. Vajna nor Mr. Kassar has been available for comment.    The events have focused attention on Carolco, a New York Stock Exchange company, and the manner in which it built itself. Live Entertainment is a firm that was pieced together by Peter Hoffman, Carolco's president and chief executive, and by Mr. Menendez. Under Mr. Menendez's reign Live Entertainment grew swiftly, leading some analysts to call it Carolco's most valuable asset.    Mr. Hoffman said Monday that the crime &quot;won't affect us&quot; as a company. &quot;It's awful. It's a terrible loss. But we'll get through it.&quot;    Officials of Live Entertainment and friends of Mr. Menendez have repeatedly dismissed the possibility that the deaths may have been related to any brush with organized crime. The suggestion is &quot;bizarre and offensive,&quot; Roger R. Smith, Live's acting president, said on Monday. The murders, he added, were &quot;in the category of meaningless, unexplained things. We may find out they had the wrong house.&quot;    But a close look at the evolution of Carolco and Live Entertainment uncovers some troubling coincidences. Carolco was founded in 1976 by Messrs. Vajna and Kassar, two foreign-film distributors. The company hit the jackpot after helping to finance &quot;Rambo, First Blood, Part II&quot; and it went public three years ago, becoming known for macho action films such as &quot;Red Heat&quot; and &quot;Rambo III.&quot; The duo hired Mr. Hoffman, a tax attorney, to run the company. As part of an effort to diversify, Carolco acquired International Video Entertainment Inc., an ailing distributor of home videos, in a series of transactions beginning in 1986. International Video was owned by Noel C. Bloom. Mr. Bloom was identified in a 1986 report on organized crime by the California Attorney's General Office as a &quot;major distributor of X-rated movies&quot; and a &quot;former associate of the late Michael Zaffarano of the Bonanno&quot; organized-crime family. The report also said Mr. Bloom was thought to have received his start in pornography with financial help from another figure connected to organized crime.    Mr. Bloom stayed on at the company as president for 90 to 120 days, according to Mr. Mason. Mr. Bloom declines to comment. An attorney for him says &quot;I've only known him as a reputable&quot; video distributor.    In 1987, Mr. Bloom filed suit in Los Angeles superior court alleging that International Video and Carolco had failed to pay him $500,000 due under the sale agreement. The companies countersued, claiming, among other things, that Mr. Bloom had overstated the value of International Video. Last year, a referee agreed upon by the two sides found in Mr. Bloom's favor. Carolco and International Video are appealing that decision.    Mr. Hoffman brought in Mr. Menendez to run the video company after the two were introduced by a mutual friend, Mr. Mason. Mr. Menendez was a former Coopers andamp; Lybrand CPA who later spent 14 years working at RCA Corp., first at its Hertz subsidiary and then at its record division. He was upset after another person was brought in to be a senior executive in the record division, Mr. Mason says.    Several friends describe Mr. Menendez, who was 45, as &quot;a straight arrow&quot; who rarely drank and was close to his family. &quot;In an industry that is prone to excess, he was prone to the straight line,&quot; says Ralph King, a close friend and an executive at Enigma Entertainment Corp. &quot;He was always alert and aware. He chose not to cloud his vision and judgment.&quot; Mr. Menendez, he says, was &quot;very friendly, very outgoing, very warm and very much a gentleman.&quot;    His passion evidently was business. &quot;He was by far the brightest, toughest businessman I have ever worked with. He was extremely well-read. He was always ahead of his competition,&quot; says Mr. King, who is also a former executive of International Video. &quot;Business was a major part of his life.&quot;    Live Entertainment officials say Mr. Menendez turned the company around, partly by aggressively pursuing video distribution deals with independent producers. In early 1988, International Video merged with Lieberman Enterprises Inc., a Minneapolis distributor of recorded music and videocassettes, to become Live Entertainment. The combined company's earnings soared. So did its stock price, drawing attention from Wall Street.    Early on, International Video arranged to have much of its distribution of videocassettes handled by a unit of MCA Inc., one of Hollywood's biggest entertainment conglomerates. MCA -- which has gotten adverse publicity itself in the past year because of dealings with alleged organized-crime figures -- also made a $15 million loan to International Video. The distribution agreement is due to expire early next year, and International Video has said it might not renew the contract. For a time, International Video also manufactured videocassettes for the MCA Home Entertainment Group.    &quot;They {Live Entertainment's people} seemed to be making all the right moves,&quot; says Andre Blay, an independent producer. &quot;They were well regarded. They paid their bills on time and were tough negotiators. When a deal was struck it was honored. They were on a roll.&quot;    Then in June, Live Entertainment completed its acquisition of BeckZack Corp., which owns the 81-store Strawberries audio and home-video retailing chain in the Northeast. BeckZack's principal shareholder was Morris Levy, a man who was convicted in May 1988 of conspiring to extort payments from a record wholesaler. He remains free pending an appeal of his conviction.    An FBI affidavit filed in federal court in New York in connection with an investigation of Mr. Levy quoted an unnamed federal informant as saying that a faction of the Genovese crime family owned an interest in the Strawberries chain. The affidavit also called Mr. Levy &quot;a lucrative source of cash and property for leaders of the Genovese&quot; crime family. The assistant U.S. Attorney who handled the Levy prosecution says he can't comment beyond the affidavit. A lawyer for Mr. Levy denies that his client has any connection with organized crime or knows anything about the Menendez murders.    Live's Mr. Smith says the company spent six months in an exhaustive process of due dilligence before completing the purchase of BeckZack for $40.5 million. &quot;We engaged lawyers who specialized in white-collar criminal areas. We found the operation of Strawberries to be whistle clean,&quot; Mr. Smith says.    Mr. Levy owned a 90% stake in the company, according to Mr. Smith. He declines to identify the other owners but insists none of them have any organized-crime ties. &quot;There was no reason for any suspicion about any of them,&quot; Mr. Smithsays.    Mr. Mason, the director, says, &quot;We paid more than a fair price. It was legitimate. It was well negotiated. There wasn't acrimony.&quot;    Friends insist Mr. Menedez didn't face any significant business conflicts and didn't have any known enemies. The company provided Mr. Menendez with two life insurance policies. One was a $5 million personal life insurance policy, the beneficiaries of which couldn't immediately be learned. The other was a $15 million keyman life insurance policy the company held.    The Menendez family moved to Beverly Hills last fall from a rented home in Calabassas. Friends of the family say Eric Menendez had received threats from gang members in Calabassas after he intervened in a fight after a high-school tennis match. Friends say the family received some threatening phone calls after the incident, and at one point one of its cars was painted and a tire was slashed. However, they say the threats weren't related to the move to Beverly Hills. Carolco now is moving quickly to limit the damage to Live Entertainment. Mr. Hoffman has been named acting chairman and Mr. Smith acting president. Mr. Menendez had named well-regarded executives to head two of the company's divisions, and some analysts think the company will continue to grow, albeit more slowly. Live's shares fell about $2.50 after the killings but have stabilized, closing yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $18 a share each, up 37 1/2 cents.    The upheavals come at a time when Carolco has been raising the number of films it has in production. The company has also been aggressively pursuing acquisitions. It has been involved in a bitter bidding contest with Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti for the assets of troubled De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, a company that has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws.    Hollywood executives and agents say Carolco has prospered despite turning out a number of pictures that have been box-office and critical disappointments in the U.S., such as &quot;DeepStar Six.&quot; The company's strong suit has been its overseas sales of theatrical and video distribution rights. &quot;Our strength is finance and sales,&quot; says Mr. Hoffman. Its weakness, he adds, is that it &quot;needs to be better at the institutional process of making movies.&quot; (Carolco earned $35 million last year on $164 million in revenue; its stock closed yesterday at $9.50, up 12 1/2 cents.)    Carolco has become known for its largess and its snap decision-making. Hollywood agents say Carolco frequently makes a hefty offer for a movie deal and then gives agents just one hour or so to take it or leave it. &quot;We pay more than other people in town,&quot; says Mr. Hoffman. &quot;One thing you never do is leave an offer on the table and let others take potshots at it.&quot;    And the company has maintained an image of prosperity. Messrs. Vajna and Kassar fly in a private Bac-III jet and drive Rolls-Royces provided by the company. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the company paid $598,412 in security services for Messrs. Kassar and Vanja. The security payments started, according to Mr. Hoffman, when the company produced &quot;Rambo III.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
