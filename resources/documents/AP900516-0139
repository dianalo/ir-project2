The Senate voted 16-14 Tuesday to create a paid King holiday forstate employees and restore a paid Columbus Day holiday. Themeasure would replace a law signed last year replacing Columbus Daywith King Day.   The House gave the measure tentative approval on a voice vote,and Gov. Rose Mofford said she would sign it after a formal votelater today.   But opponents said they would gather signatures for areferendum. They would have 90 days to do so, and polls suggestthat more than 80 percent of Arizonans believe the issue should bedecided by the voters.   Opponents say an extra holiday would cost the state $500,000 to$3.5 million. Supporters point to a January report that conventionsand meetings canceled because of years of fighting over a Kingholiday cost the state about $25 million in 1987-88.   The measure's chief Senate sponsor, Democrat Carolyn Walker,said there was no need to let the voters have a say in what couldbecome a racially divisive referendum.   ``I know there are those who say we are taking this away fromthe people,'' she said. ``I would like to remind them that ... thepeople elected us in the state of Arizona as leaders.''   Republican Sen. Doug Todd said votes against the holiday hadhelped build ``a Berlin Wall ... of fear, bigotry and hatred.''   Last year's King-for-Columbus bill so angered King opponents andColumbus supporters that they joined forces and gathered nearlytwice the 43,350 signatures needed to hold a referendum inNovember. The law was suspended in the meantime.   Approval of the new bill would wipe out that referendum butcould lead to another.   Former Gov. Evan Mecham, who was impeached in 1988 and isrunning again, has promised to put thousands of his volunteers intothe field to help gather signatures. He says the issue isn't Kingbut the people's right to vote.   Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt declared a King holiday in 1986,but Mecham rescinded it days before it would have taken effect.   Forty-seven other states have a holiday honoring King. The otherstates without official King holidays are Montana and New Hampshire.</TEXT></DOC>
