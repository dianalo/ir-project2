A rise in the so-called reference price wouldn'tautomatically lift world market prices by the amount of theincrease. But as the official goal of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, a higher reference figurewould underscore the group's determination to prop up oilprices and revenues, which have sagged badly this year. Theboost in the target price would be the first in four years.</LP><TEXT>   In hopes of achieving higher prices, OPEC members, whoproduce more than 40% of the non-Communist world's crude oil,would effectively cut back on the combined amount of oilthey're pumping.   A proposed new production arrangement would set a totaloutput ceiling for OPEC members of 22.5 million barrels aday. On paper, that would be 400,000 barrels a day higherthan the current ceiling. But in fact, if honored, such a newceiling would mean actual output would drop substantiallybecause it would cut down on production by some members thatexceed the quotas.   Specifically, it would bring the United Arab Emirates, achronic overproducer, back into the OPEC fold under a higherquota offered under terms hammered out in Jiddah, SaudiArabia, two weeks ago by five Persian Gulf ministers.   But some major obstacles to a quick agreement still facethe oil ministers as they open the formal part of theirmidyear conference today, including a tense disagreement overoil policy by Iraq and Kuwait.   Iraq has threatened to use military force against Kuwaitto settle their differences. This rising tension puts two ofOPEC's key Persian Gulf ministers, who were in on the recentJiddah meeting, on opposite sides of the price issue here.The Iraqi minister is now demanding a new reference price of$25 a barrel while his counterpart from Kuwait wants to holdit at $18.   Also, Libya's oil minister, Fawzi A. Shakshuki, supportsthe Iraqi minister's call for a $25 benchmark and stronglyobjects to other parts of the Jiddah plan. &quot;I was not part ofthe Jiddah agreement,&quot; he said last night, adding: &quot;If thereis any {quota} increase, Libya should also get an increase.&quot;   While OPEC's bottom line is the price of oil, in many waysthe discussions here over where to set the reference priceare academic unless the cartel's production is brought intoline with demand. Total output of the 13 oil exporters hassoared as high as 24 million barrels a day this year,contributing to an enormous buildup of petroleum inventoriesworld-wide and causing the average price of OPEC crude todrop as low as $14 a barrel.   Prices have recovered at least $3 a barrel since theJiddah meeting, but still remain below the current $18reference price.   OPEC economists late yesterday told an informal meeting ofministers that their overproduction had resulted in anincrease of 184 million barrels in world oil inventories thisyear.   After the meeting, OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said thereport concluded that to eliminate this inventory &quot;overhang&quot;in the remainder of the year, OPEC production should be heldto 22 million barrels a day.   An increase in demand for OPEC oil to some 23 millionbarrels a day is expected, however, in the year's secondhalf. So OPEC officials reasoned that strict adherence toproduction quotas should hold total OPEC output below thatlevel, keeping prices firm.   As a result, most ministers favor a new higher referenceprice immediately. Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister,suggested that &quot;$20 is a good place to start.&quot; But whateverthe target price, oil traders here observing the proceedingsquestioned whether it could be met if overproducers don'thonor their new pledges to abide by their quotas. To thatend, delegates disclosed that they expect to increase quotacompliance checks if a new ceiling is adopted.   Past overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emiratesis the chief reason Iraq has moved tanks and troops to itsborder with Kuwait. Iraq has angrily blamed Kuwait and theemirates for &quot;economic warfare&quot; against it by causing thisyear's oil-price fall. The threat of military action becauseof that dispute has had a sobering effect on OPEC ministershere, although the Iraqi and Kuwaiti ministers joked andlaughed with each other during photo sessions yesterday.</TEXT></DOC>
