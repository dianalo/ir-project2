U.S. diplomats said an aerial blockade and secondary sanctionsagainst nations flouting the U.N. trade embargo would be consideredurgently, beginning Sunday.   The vote was 15-0 in the emergency session sought by France.   ``By singling out diplomatic missions for attack, Iraq confirmsits preference for instruments of force to instruments of diplomacyand negotiation,'' said U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering.   ``As early as possible ... we must take concrete steps underChapter 7 of the U.N. Charter to deal with Iraq's continuedviolations of council resolutions, the U.N. Charter andinternational law.   The resolution was the seventh adopted overwhelmingly by thecouncil since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. The council hascondemned the occupation, demanded release of all foreign hostages,imposed a trade embargo and approved the use of maritime force toimplement the embargo.   Numerous speakers said that Iraq had violated international lawon protection of diplomatic missions by cutting off water, power,food and other resources to foreign missions in Kuwait City.   Numerous speakers said that Iraq had violated international lawon protection of diplomatic missions by cutting off water, power,food and other resources to foreign missions in Kuwait City.   The council expressed outrage at Iraq's violation Friday of theFrench, Belgian and Canadian embassy compounds, the detention ofdiplomats and kidnapping of three French nationals.   The vote came about 3 a.m. EDT Sunday after hours of informalconsultations by members of the 15-nation council.   The resolution ``strongly condemns aggressive acts perpetratedby Iraq against diplomatic premises and personnel in Kuwait as wellas the abduction of foreign nationals who were present in thosepremises.'' The resolution expresses outrage and demands theimmediate release of all foreign nationals.   In a warning of further action, the resolution says it would``pursue its consultations urgently in order to take furtherconcrete measures as soon as possible.''   President Francois Mitterrand said Saturday that his governmentwould ask that the U.N. trade embargo be widened to include airtraffic to Iraq and punishment of countries violating the blockade.   The Iraqi government denied it raided any diplomatic homes orbuildings in Kuwait. Iraq has annexed Kuwait and withdrawn thediplomatic privileges and immunity of embassies there, orderingthem to move to Baghdad.   An Iraqi spokesman said there were strict instructions againstentering foreign missions, although they had not been regarded asdiplomatic territory since Aug. 24, according to the Iraqi NewsAgency.   The Iraqi government now calls Kuwait a province of Iraq andsays the 1961 Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic and Consularrelations do not apply.   The council already has said that force may be used to implementthe sweeping U.N. trade embargo against Iraq in terms of maritimeshipping. But an air embargo, although included in the general U.N.sanctions, is difficult to implement because forcing planes downinvolves military risk and could mean attack, diplomats said.   An air embargo also would require cooperation of all of Iraq'sneighbors.   In addition, the diplomats said, drafting the language for sucha blockade would be time-consuming and was unlikely to be supportedby the Soviet Union, China and some Third World nations.   Iraq has rejected all six previous Security Council resolutionscondemning Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and occupation of Kuwait.   The members of the Security Council are Britain, Canada, China,Colombia, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Ivory Coast, Malaysia,Romania, the Soviet Union, the United States, Yemen and Zaire.</TEXT></DOC>
