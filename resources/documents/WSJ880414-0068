Drivers were shifting their cars into &quot;park,&quot; only to have them back up without warning -- sometimes with disastrous effects. Douglas Dixon, a 33-year-old Ford Motor Co. engineer, suggested to superiors that a design change might be needed. That was 1971.    Seven years later, his memos were being used by others to support allegations that a stunning 26 million Ford cars and trucks had unsafe transmissions and should be recalled. The ordeal of Mr. Dixon's lifetime was about to begin. Written out of loyalty, his words had become liabilities to his employer. Lawyers both suing and defending Ford demanded his time. There were harassing phone calls, even a death threat. The burden grew and grew.    Finally, in the early morning of Jan. 29, 1985, the conflict apparently claimed Douglas Dixon himself. He jumped six floors to his death from a window in a suburban Detroit hospital where he had gone the day before for psychiatric help. He was 47.    ---   Between 1977 and 1980, the company that put America on wheels stood accused of producing an entire decade of cars that were killing and injuring people.    Newspapers, magazines and television served up grisly accident stories as critics demanded a recall. Ford resisted as if its corporate life were at stake -- as it may have been.    Then, on the last day of 1980, the government declared the problem solved: Ford would notify nearly 23 million people that their 1970 to 1979 cars and trucks with automatic transmission had an apparent defect and would provide &quot;corrective action&quot; in the form of a dashboard warning sticker. There would be no recall. But at last the controversy seemed over.    Only it wasn't -- and it still isn't. Today, 17 years after Mr. Dixon wrote his memos and seven years after Ford and the government settled, the struggle over these aging cars and trucks drags on.    No other auto-safety conflict has ever run so long or been so bitter. The number of deaths blamed on unexpected backing-up by these vehicles now exceeds that of such celebrated cases as Pinto gas-tank fires, defective Firestone 500 tires and Audi &quot;sudden accelerations&quot; -- combined. Safety regulators and consumer advocates, once allies, continue to squabble over the government's unprecedented about-face long after most people thought the matter was over with. Ford, having paid untold millions in thousands of cases, continues to fight suits over new incidents, most of which few people ever hear about.    Scores of interviews and scrutiny of hundreds of documents tell a story that, in fact, isn't even about transmissions any more. It's about failure. It's about a breakdown in the system for resolving major public-safety questions: a government poised to act that folds at the last moment; an auto maker that dodges financial disaster but never quite earns a clean bill of health; and a court system that neither exonerates nor condemns, but mostly serves as a pay window for private settlements.    To critics, the lesson is that if the stakes are high enough, no one will bring an errant manufacturer to heel. To Ford and its supporters, the lesson is that if a few activists shout loud enough long enough, they can keep a bogus issue alive.    Most of this has happened because one thing keeps happening: Every so often another pre-1980 Ford-built vehicle, left apparently in &quot;park&quot; with the engine running, starts backing up. Consider this sample from recent months:   --Last September, 22-year-old Kimberly Isaac of Baton Rouge, La., was badly scraped over a large part of her body when a 1977 LTD she had just parked in a grocery-store lot backed up, knocking her over and dragging her in circles.    --A month later, 87-year-old Clarence Jones of Saugatuck, Mich., was pinned under his 1975 LTD when it backed up after he left it running in front a hardware store. He was killed. The warning sticker Ford had sent years before had been dutifully applied to the steering wheel.    --In January, Carter-Anne Nadonley of Bethesda, Md., watched a 1979 Lincoln she had just stepped out of start backing up and then circle backward for three hours, until a tow-truck operator corraled it.    Accidents like these happen with other cars and trucks, too. But, critics say, they occur far too often with pre-1980 Fords. Those cars' death rate for this kind of thing has been calculated by government agencies at 2 to 4.5 times greater than that of other domestic vehicles of this vintage. Eight years ago, when the government decided against a recall, the toll was about 165 deaths and over 3,000 injuries. Today, deaths approach 300, and injuries total more than 5,000, according to government figures.    The clincher, critics say, is the comparison with Fords built after 1980. For them the death count is down as much as fivefold, and more like other cars'. For 1980 and later vehicles, Ford redesigned certain transmission parts.    To Ford, the entire controversy is bunk. It doesn't dispute that these tragedies happen, but it says pre-1980 Fords aren't any more accident-prone than other cars. Automatic transmissions of all makes are sometimes mis-shifted by careless drivers, it says, adding that its later models weren't fixed, just refined.    What the seemingly damning statistics really measure, Ford says, is the impact of years of anti-Ford publicity. Auto-safety critics, regulators and the news media long ago drummed a &quot;voodoo defect&quot; into the public consciousness, dooming any hope of ever getting unbiased data, Ford says. So if a pre-1980 Ford goes into reverse, the police and everyone else blame the car; if it's another make, they blame the driver. In short, it's a Big Lie.    To this day, &quot;a few special-interest groups refuse to accept the facts,&quot; declares one Ford official, citing various auto-safety critics, consumer advocates and lawyers. They are using the press to prolong the controversy, contends another Ford man. &quot;Their success in getting folks like you to do just that has been pretty remarkable,&quot; he tells an interviewer.    Age, of course, is gradually taking the pre-1980 Fords, Mercurys and Lincolns out of the picture. Yet so many were built that an estimated 10 million are still being driven. The drivers, though, are changing; as the cars age, less-affluent people own more and more of them.    The form the controversy takes today is a litigation war. Ford calculated the damage claims outstanding against it on Jan. 6 at $598 million. The figure has been steadily dropping, but new claims can be expected until the '90s. And Ford also faces the possible reinstatement of a huge class action on behalf of millions of owners of 1976 to 1979 Fords.    Curiously, this now-epic dispute begins where the actual business of driving ends. By one estimate, automatic transmissions are shifted into park 100 billion times a year. It's such a simple act that people don't even look when they do it. And because the park gear locks up a transmission and drive wheels so solidly, drivers often leave their cars briefly with the engine on even if they know they shouldn't.    But on rare occasions, an automatic transmission lands in a precarious position between park and reverse. After a time -- seconds or minutes -- it can go fully into reverse because of vibrations from a slamming door or trunk, or sometimes from internal fluid pressures. Any car's transmission can teeter in this unstable position. The allegation against pre-1980 Fords is that in some models the design makes it too easy for drivers to shift into this in-between spot, while in others, the transmission too easily slips into reverse if such an error is made.    The Problem Surfaces   Ford got a chance to investigate this so-called park-to-reverse problem long before there was any public controversy. The catalyst was the late Mr. Dixon. In early 1971, he and others routinely reviewing customer complaints were struck by growing reports of Fords unexpectedly moving into reverse. They dug out more than 40 examples dating back to 1968.    To Mr. Dixon fell the task of passing those findings along. Eventually he sent two businesslike memos, through channels and with the concurrence of his boss, to other appropriate engineers and departments. Cars were backing up &quot;frequently in the field with actual high accident incidence,&quot; he wrote. Just as less-friendly observers would do later, he surmised that transmissions were being balanced between park and reverse, and he recommended exploring a design change &quot;to prevent a false sense of security&quot; by drivers. He even provided a sketch.    Though few outsiders would ever hear about it, those memos got attention. In early 1972 Ford stepped up its reporting and inspection of cars involved in incidents. It checked its quality control. Some engineers brainstormed alternative parts and even built and tested some. One early proposal would be hailed years later by critics as a suppressed &quot;three-cent fix&quot;the projected per-vehicle cost listed in Ford documents.    But Ford concluded that none of these ideas would help much and some might hurt. It settled instead for some inconspicuous driver aids. It made the parking instructions in owners' manuals more explicit. It took the letters &quot;ark&quot; off the word &quot;Park&quot; to encourage drivers to push the shift lever over farther.    Then a Falls Church, Va., mother of four yanked the issue from Ford's hands and dumped it into the lap of the federal government.    On a brisk fall day in 1976, Constance Bartholomew was loading bags into the rear seat of her idling 1973 Lincoln in a grocery-store parking lot when the car suddenly backed up. It knocked her down, ran over her leg and plowed into some parked cars, hurtling her six-week-old son off the front seat.    She complained to Ford and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, to no avail. Then she discovered Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, founded by Ralph Nader and Consumers Union. He learned of a similar Ford incident and dashed off a brief request for an investigation to the NHTSA in July 1977. The agency routinely asked Ford about reports of its cars &quot;jumping out of gear.&quot; No one expected much.    Ford's private, in-house transmission mystery was about to become a public war. Deep distrust on both sides would ensure that.    A Letter From Washington   In their nightmares, auto makers probably couldn't have conjured up a worse person to be the nation's top auto-safety regulator than Joan Claybrook, just appointed by President Carter. She was a former colleague of Mr. Nader and Mr. Ditlow, and Ford saw her as a political liberal suspicious of the profit motive. Her agency's query, if taken literally, appeared silly to some insiders. Who, asks Ford attorney Donald McGuigan, could seriously inquire about transmissions &quot;jumping out of park&quot;? It's a &quot;mechanical impossibility,&quot; he says, a &quot;no-brainer.&quot;    Ford's responses, however, sent safety advocates into overdrive. The company disclosed dozens of complaints and lawsuits -- along with the fact that the transmissions were on millions of cars. In no time, &quot;this became our biggest case,&quot; says Mr. Ditlow.    Then Ms. Claybrook delivered perhaps the single most important blow of the fight. In November 1977, she issued a consumer advisory warning Ford drivers of a possible problem and asking to be told of any incidents.    Today, Ford views that advisory as the corporate equivalent of Pearl Harbor. By singling out Fords, the NHTSA forever precluded a fair comparison with other makes, it says. &quot;From that day on, the data sources were contaminated and the public was set to be biased,&quot; maintains Roger E. Maugh, director of Ford's automotive safety office at the time.    The publicity did pull in reports of Ford mishaps, and nine months later Ms. Claybrook would again warn owners, this time armed with reports of 777 accidents, 259 injuries and 23 deaths.    Critics were on a roll. &quot;I wanted to crucify Ford,&quot; remembers Ms. Bartholomew, who in the meantime had learned that her son had a crippling malady, the onset of which she believes was triggered by the trauma of the car crash. She began working without pay at the Center for Auto Safety. Ford now cites that link while glossing over the time sequence, inviting a conclusion that this issue arose because a committed safety critic had an accident.    Within Ford, pressure was building. Two more employees began asking questions about transmissions, and they had a bit more clout than Doug Dixon. One was Philip Caldwell, the vice chairman. The other man, as he used to say, had his name on the building.    Management Moves   Henry Ford II, aboard a corporate jet one August morning in 1978, read a press report of the transmission flap and asked his chief of car engineering what was going on. The aide, Thomas Feaheny, recalls his answer: The cars are all right, the problem is careless drivers. Then he recounted to the boss how his own Lincoln had once gone into reverse as he was putting supplies in the trunk at a lumberyard. He was able to stop it, and no harm was done.    Mr. Ford's reaction? &quot;He turned white,&quot; Mr. Feaheny remembers. (Years later, litigation would unearth some two dozen &quot;park-to-reverse&quot; incidents with Ford employees, including some working on Ford's defense.)    The next morning, by Mr. Feaheny's recollection, Mr. Caldwell gathered with about 20 executives to the board room to talk transmissions. The usually low-key vice chairman got right to the point. More must be done. More cars examined, more data gathered, more engineers put on the case.    And one other thing: Find out what can be done to reduce these accidents. There wasn't any &quot;if anything,&quot; says Mr. McGuigan, the Ford attorney: &quot;He said, 'By God, what can be done?'&quot; Mr. McGuigan adds that the vice chairman wasn't branding existing models unsafe; he just wanted future models improved. (Mr. Caldwell declined to comment.)    Executives got the message. A five-city consumer hot line was set up to solicit reports that could then be systematically investigated. Some 6,100 calls came in; 2,000 vehicles and stacks of accident and repair records were examined.    A hundred engineers were put on the case. Some hatched ideas like an electric motor to put the car into park when the driver's door opened, or something to light up or buzz if the lever wasn't fully in park. What Ford finally decided on was to redesign certain small parts inside the transmission and steering column. At the same time, it redesigned an automatic parking-brake release used on some models so it wouldn't function when the car shifted to reverse.    Then came a critical question: Would Ford go back and modify cars on the road? Ford decided no. That choice would forever cloud the reputation of a generation of older Fords. It also meant Ford was ready to go to mat with the government.    Ford vs. Claybrook   Though few knew it at the time, this would be a mismatch. While Ford was working, Joan Claybrook was losing ground. The NHTSA hired and fired two computer companies before settling on a third to analyze the thousands of complaints coming in. Staff changes slowed things down. Months went by. Mr. Ditlow, her former colleague, began writing letters and accusing the agency of foot-dragging.    To proceed, the government had to have an official position as to why the vehicles were going into reverse. Ms. Claybrook finally ordered 25 engineers, lawyers, statisticians and aides in on a Sunday morning to settle the matter. &quot;We weren't leaving until we came up with an answer,&quot; she says.    Spread over six rooms, papers on the floors, they worked without even meal breaks. By nightfall, they had two separate theories for two groups of the vehicles, both involving the forces from certain springs in the shifting hardware. This done, the NHTSA in June made a preliminary defect ruling, the precursor to a recall.    But time and events were on Ford's side. First, relations were fraying between Ms. Claybrook, the career activist, and her boss, Transportation Secretary Neil Goldschmidt, a pragmatic politician from Oregon (now its governor). By 1980, Ms. Claybrook says, she was even having trouble getting in to see him.    In addition, it was a bum time for anyone to be pushing for the biggest auto recall in history. The industry seemed about to collapse. Auto unemployment was skyhigh. The U.S. was having to bail out Chrysler. And Ford was hemorrhaging; its losses would hit $1.54 billion in 1980.    Candidate Ronald Reagan, meantime, was claiming that the Carter administration was anti-business. The specter of a recall forced on a staggering auto maker wasn't helping the Democrats.    All of this perversely improved Ford's position. Inside and outside Ford, many people believed a recall would cripple, if not kill, the No. 2 auto maker. It would dwarf the Pinto recall, where 1.5 million cars were summoned for some simple work. Installing new transmission parts would mean tricky operations on more than 10 times as many vehicles.    Climax of a Recall Drive   Officially, Ford never argued finances. It said there was nothing to fix, period. But the potential cost preyed on Ford officials' minds, and they evidently were at least prepared to plead cost. A briefing paper drawn up for Mr. Caldwell before a meeting with Secretary Goldschmidt ticks off some striking arithmetic: Just mailing recall notices would take months; supplies of parts would have to rise fivefold; replacing transmission fluid alone would cost $50 million. If every service bay in every one of the 6,700 Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealers did nothing else but modify transmissions, it would still take nearly a year to do them all.    &quot;The magnitude of such a program exceeds the financial resources of the Ford Motor Co.,&quot; the document solemnly states.    In this environment, just before the 1980 presidential election, Ms. Claybrook finally proposed to Mr. Goldschmidt a formal defect ruling and a two-step recall order. It was exactly the wrong moment. She says she never got a direct response. After the election loss, Mr. Goldschmidt told his general counsel to settle the case.    The agreement: Ford would mail drivers a short letter and a stick-on reminder that before leaving the car they should shift into park, set the brake and turn off the engine. The word &quot;warning&quot; wasn't on it. The settlement was announced on the eve of a holiday, when news tends to get little attention.    Suddenly, the struggle between Ford and the government was over. To end it, a secretary of transporation had, for the first time, pulled the defect-finding and recall authority of the nation's top auto-safety regulator. There would be no recall.    For Mr. Goldschmidt, the settlement would become an issue years later, when he was running for Oregon governor in 1986. Ford Chairman Donald Petersen appeared at three fund-raisers for him, stirring some unflattering innuendo in the press. Mr. Goldchmidt says he invited Mr. Petersen to appear and sees nothing improper. A Ford spokesman says Mr. Petersen, who once lived in Oregon, backed Mr. Goldschmidt solely because he felt he would be an effective leader. Mr. Petersen declined to be interviewed.    Questions about the settlement decision rankle Mr. Goldschmidt today. For years, &quot;I've lived with Claybrook trying to put God on her side,&quot; he says. &quot;I am so tired of this whole subject. I have no interest in helping you with this story.&quot; He does say, though, that he was &quot;underwhelmed&quot; by the NHTSA's case and that &quot;the quality of the work turned out by Claybrook was nothing to brag about.&quot; And he says neither politics nor Ford's finances swayed him.    One former aide isn't so sure. &quot;I think he had become gravely concerned about the condition of the automobile industry&quot; and especially Ford, says William Johnston, a former assistant transportation secretary. Mr. Johnston concedes that Ford's finances affected his own thinking.    In any case, the settlement settled little. In a parting shot, Ms. Claybrook helped organize a 1981 conference to coach attorneys for accident victims on how to beat Ford in court. &quot;I thought maybe they could force Ford to recall the cars&quot; by winning big damage awards, she says.    The Center for Auto Safety wasn't satisfied either, and it began suing the NHTSA -- so far in vain -- to try to force a reopening of the case. &quot;I'll go to my grave before I give up on this one,&quot; Mr. Ditlow says.    For a time, in fact, now-retired NHTSA chief counsel Frank Berndt had to defend against the Center, in effect arguing for Ford and against his own earlier position. &quot;That gave me a new appreciation for ladies of the street,&quot; Mr. Berndt remarks.    As for the stickers, few Ford drivers even applied them. Only about 7% did, according to a spot check by the Center for Auto Safety. And Ford never reached more than two million owners at all.    The company says it never evaluated the sticker program or its 1980 transmission design changes. When the issue is raised, Mr. Maugh, the former top Ford safety engineer, becomes visibly angry: &quot;We closed the investigation. This has gotten ridiculous after 10 years,&quot; he says.    The Litigation War   Now the transmission controversy is on its final battleground, the civil courts. A trickle of suits in the 1970s became a torrent in the 1980s. Ford tries to keep as much as possible about the litigation secret, but it's known that by 1980 about 1,000 suits had been filed against the company in all. Estimates of plaintiffs' lawyers now range from 2,000 to 3,000.    The legal system of a judge, a jury and sworn evidence might seem the one way to finally answer who is right about this intractable dispute. But that hasn't quite worked out either. To some critics, in fact, litigation is the last great failure in this grand safety conflict.    In only 27 cases has a jury rendered a verdict. Ford has won 22. Many hundreds of cases have been settled, in a process that has become routine: The sides agree, dollars are paid, and terms, at Ford's insistence, are sealed. Settle, pay and seal, settle, pay and seal -- almost a courthouse parody of the assembly line Henry Ford perfected eight decades ago.    Sometimes, suing isn't even necessary. One lawyer says that in about a dozen cases, he simply got together the pertinent information and sent it to Ford's local attorneys. Clients got up to $75,000 each.    One time Ford might have done better to settle. After a Texas woman was killed by her LTD while closing her driveway gate, Ford, according to Houston attorney Ernest Cannon, spurned a $350,000 settlement offer. A jury assessed $4.4 million, $4 million of it punitive damages. Upholding it, a state appeals court said Ford &quot;knew of the dangerous condition but failed to correct it . . . {in} apparently willful disregard of the consumers.&quot;    But Ford, with its stable of expert litigators, isn't exactly a pushover in court. Ford and its foes both rely on pools of expert witnesses, who have a studied disdain for each other's views. The potential expert-witness fees are huge. For those vying for the assignment, the Springfield, Mo., firm of Woolsey, Fisher, Whiteaker andamp; McDonald once ran an &quot;Experts' Super Bowl&quot; -- with transmission authorities demolishing one another's arguments face-to-face.    Trials of a Law Firm   Woolsey Fisher has sued Ford more than anyone else has, and its experiences are revealing. The old-line firm has found the process frustrating and debilitating. &quot;We started out on a crusade. We were going to do it all,&quot; says William McDonald, a senior partner. But eventually &quot;the client says, 'I want the money.'&quot;    The firm computerized a list of 24,000 Ford incidents. It invested over $2 million in a library for a half-million pages of documents -- from Ford, the government and others' suits. Huge up-front costs overwhelmed the revenue the cases produced at first. At times between 1981 and 1986, says partner Robert M.N. Palmer, some of the partners' checks were skimpy. Partly because of all the problems, 10 of the firm's two dozen attorneys left in 1986, Mr. Palmer says, though today he says, &quot;We were right. The investment paid off.&quot;    One thing Woolsey Fisher came up against was Ford's transmission &quot;reading room.&quot; Those seeking Ford documents are often invited to Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., where, in what lawyers describe as an ill-ventilated and ill-lit subbasement room, some 500,000 pages are stacked and boxed without index and in no evident order.    Trying to fathom them, Woolsey Fisher flew in a dozen employees, who for five days read into tape recorders code numbers on the documents. Back home, a computer put them in sequence. It produced a surprise: Out of some half-million numbers, about 6,000 were missing.    Ford readily acknowledged the gap, claiming privilege for the missing papers. But it also claimed privilege for the list of what was privileged. Woolsey Fisher finally at least got that list, after a court hearing. It alone proved to be 804 pages long.    In the end, reflects the firm's Mr. McDonald, &quot;this is expensive and inefficient, and Ford wins. At one time we were outraged -- I can't tell you the rage we felt. Now I'm six years older and still outraged, but question how much of this I can shoulder.&quot;    Last year, Woolsey Fisher cleared away over 75 Ford transmission cases that were combined, settling them in batches of seven or eight. Terms, of course, were suppressed. &quot;I feel like hell&quot; about that, Mr. McDonald says, &quot;but I'm tired, too.&quot; For a dispute as vast as this, he concludes, &quot;Litigation isn't the right process.&quot;    Ford won't say how much the legal actions have cost it in all. The Center for Auto Safety studied about 200 suits and calculated that Ford paid an average of $175,000 each in settlements or jury awards, a total of about $35 million for those cases. Others estimate the settlements range from tens of thousands of dollars for mild injuries up to a couple of million in death cases.    Whatever it is, Ford now is in a much better position to afford it. Back off the canvas, it earned $4.6 billion in 1987 -- a one-year record for any auto maker.    Maybe 200 Ford transmission suits remain unresolved nationally, Mr. Palmer estimates. More will come, but time again is on Ford's side. About 7,000 pre-1980 Ford-built cars and trucks with automatic transmissions are junked each day, by one estimate. By around 1993 or '94, nearly all will be gone, at least from the U.S.    And those that remain are being traded down the economic ladder, driven increasingly by poor people. &quot;Those deaths, unfortunately, aren't attractive in contingent-fee cases,&quot; says one attorney. These owners also may be less likely to sue.    Some things have changed with the passing of years. Ford recently asked Ms. Claybrook and Mr. Ditlow, along with several others, for their views on how to improve auto safety. &quot;Under Petersen, Ford has become very interested in safety progress,&quot; Ms. Claybrook says, though she doesn't expect that its position in the transmission dispute will ever change.    Thus, anger and bitterness will remain. &quot;What kills you is the dishonesty of life,&quot; says Ms. Bartholomew, who has watched her son -- the child thrown to the floor of a runaway Ford -- become progressively more crippled by the malady she believes the accident brought on. Asked what her more than 10 years of fighting the transmission battle has accomplished, she replies: &quot;Nothing.&quot;    ---         Runaway Fords: A Sampling of Incidents VICTIM: Francis Rilling, 54 PLACE, DATE: Linton, N.D, Feb. 5, 1987 WHAT HAPPENED: Backed over by pickup when got out to close                a gate, killed OUTCOME: Settled, undisclosed terms, no suit filed VICTIM: Alfred Schwalbe, 68 PLACE, DATE: Kildeer, N.D., Feb. 4, 1987 WHAT HAPPENED: Pinned against livestock watertank by LTD,                drowned OUTCOME: Suit pending VICTIM: Louise LaBelle, 62 PLACE, DATE: Tomball, Tex., Feb. 11, 1985 WHAT HAPPENED: Killed when ran behind backing-up Thunderbird                to try to stop it OUTCOME: Verdict for Ford VICTIM: April Grohusky, 5 PLACE, DATE: Topeka, Kan, Feb. 5, 1982 WHAT HAPPENED: Killed by truck backing out of shop as ran                to greet father OUTCOME: Settled, terms undisclosed VICTIM: Annie Nowak, 52 PLACE, DATE: Bay City, Tex., Jan. 21, 1977 WHAT HAPPENED: Backed over by LTD while closing gate, killed OUTCOME: $4.4 million awarded by jury VICTIM: Eldora Moran, 42 PLACE, DATE: San Gabriel, Cal., Oct. 9, 1975 WHAT HAPPENED: Run over repeatedly and killed as Mercury                circled in the street OUTCOME: Settled, terms undislcosed VICTIM: Georgia Kulaga, 51 PLACE, DATE: Euless, Tex., Nov. 12, 1974 WHAT HAPPENED: Killed when grabbed door handle to stop                backing-up Lincoln and fell under it OUTCOME: Verdict for Ford</TEXT></DOC>
