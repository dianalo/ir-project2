The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseasesannounced Monday the experiment with the drug zidovudine, morecommonly known as AZT, will be conducted on 10 women infected withthe human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the institute, said theexperiment is an effort to find a way of treating one of the fastestgrowing categories of AIDS patients, newborn infants.   ``The prognosis for children (infected) with HIV is grim,'' saidFauci in a statement released by his agency. He said babies born towomen infected with AIDS have a 25 to 40 percent chance ofcontracting AIDS and the disease progresses much more rapidly ininfants than in adults.   ``Of those diagnosed before their first birthday, half die withinsix months of diagnosis,'' said Fauci. ``It is impossible to countthe costs in pain and heartbreak, and the social and economic burdenof caring for these children is staggering.''   Since 1981, there have been 1,600 cases of AIDS among children.Up to three times that number are thought to be infected with HIV.   The institute said little is known about how AIDS is transmittedfrom mother to baby, but it is thought to occur either duringdevelopment within the mother, at birth through contact with themother's blood, or from breast milk after birth.   Most AIDS infants are born to mothers who are intravenous drugusers or who have been sexual partners of drug users.   All of the experiments will be on women who test positive forHIV, but who are not showing AIDS symptoms.   In the first phase of the study, researchers will enroll sixwomen with no recent history of drug abuse. After the six havecompleted their course of treatment, the investigators then willtreat four women who are intravenous drug abusers and use methadone,an approved pharmaceutical used to wean patients from illegal drugs.   All 10 women will start the study with AZT injections and thencontinue through the rest of their pregnancy by taking 200 milligramAZT pills five times a day. When the test subjects go into labor,AZT will again be injected.   Following delivery, the babies will be carefully monitored for 18months for AIDS and to determine if the AZT treatment affected theirdevelopment.   The experimental treatment will be directed by researchers fromthe University of Miami and the UCLA School of Medicine in LosAngeles.   AZT is the only approved antiviral drug now available for generalprescription for treating AIDS. The drug can have serious toxic sideeffects.   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagiousdisease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering itincapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus mostoften is spread through close contact with blood, blood products orsemen from infected persons.   As of May 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 97,193 Americans,of whom more than half, or 56,468, have died since June 1, 1981,according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
