Please add the following: To accommodate the move of the 35 TTW and associated assets from GeorgeAFB, California to Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, additional air-to-ground gunneryrange and associated airspace will be required at Saylor Creek WeaponsRange. The exact size of new airspace and air-to-ground range expansionis still under study and will be included in the Mountain Home AFB, IDRealignment Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). As part of the rangeexpansion, some lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) willneed to be withdrawn for Air Force use and some private and state landswill need to be acquired. The anticipated total acquisition will representapproximately 1,500,000 acres. Where compatible and possible, land usewill remain as it is now. However, some weapons impact areas for the air-to-groundranges will be designated for sole (exclusive) Air Force use. The proposal for additional airspace requirements includes lowering thefloor of the existing military operating areas (MOAs) to 10,000 feet meansea level (MSL) for subsonic flight training over Nevada and Oregon, andpossibly extending the boundary of Paradise MOA further south. The proposalfor supersonic flight operations includes the proposed Owyhee MOA and theexpanded Saylor Creek Range, all in the state of Idaho. Supersonic flightoperations are a desirable capability for all modern fighter aircraft.Supersonic operations and associated impacts will be evaluated within thecontext of the EIS for the Mountain Home AFB Realignment and Saylor CreekExpansion. Since the EIS includes a proposed land withdrawal, the Bureau of Land Management(BLM) will be a cooperating agency for the EIS. This may require BLM landuse plans to be amended and updated to cover the expanded range area. Allissues involved in the range and airspace expansion will be addressed inthe EIS. The range and airspace expansion were not included in the original noticeof intent because the requirements associated with these expansions werebeing evaluated.We plan to hold additional scoping meetings. Specific dates and times willbe announced in the local media. Questions concerning this proposal, additional scoping, or the draft EISmay be directed to: Captain Wilfred Cassidy, HQ TAC/DEEV, Langley AFB,VA 23665-5542, Telephone (804) 764-4430. Written comments should be submitted by August 31, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="6">Patsy J.
