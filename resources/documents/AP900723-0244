The Economic Planning Agency's report on prices also offeredlittle hope for change in the amounts Japanese pay for utilitiessuch as gas and electricity.   Those charges were from 10 percent to more than 100 percenthigher than the prices paid by consumers in the United States andWestern European countries.   The report said the weakening of the yen in foreign exchangeduring the past year and lower yen prices in Japan had erased theprice differential between Japan and its Western trading partnersin international air fares, international telephone calls andexported Japanese manufactured goods.   That's good news for foreign companies that complain aboutcommunications prices inflating the cost of doing business inJapan. However, they get no relief in Japanese rents and landprices, which are the world's highest.   For Japanese consumers, relief is yet to come in the prices ofimported goods, many foods, energy and other areas, although theydo not have to worry about inflation sending prices even higher.The rise in the consumer price index has been 3 percent or lesssince 1982.   Prices are lower than overseas in such areas as photo printing,dry cleaning and facial tissues, the report said. Dry cleaning, forexample, showed New York at 105 on a price scale where Tokyoequaled 100. Hamburg was at 147, London 138 and Paris 166.   Price differentials were one of many areas covered in the recentU.S.-Japan negotiations on structural barriers to trade. Japan saidit would try to reduce price differentials where possible and theEconomic Planning Agency report surveyed some of the recentdevelopments in that area.   It attributed some price drops in Japan to market pressures thatfollowed the increase in the yen's value starting in 1985. Thatincrease made prices in Japan _ already high _ even higher whenquoted in U.S. dollars.   But, the market mechanism ``does not work sufficiently if thereare regulations that hinder competition or if there are obstaclesin the distribution process,'' the report said.   It said ``regulations should be relaxed and the Antimonopoly Actshould be strictly implemented.'' Both measures were important U.S.demands in the trade talks, which ended in June.   Yoshiro Tokunaga, director of the agency's Price ResearchDivison, told reporters that high utility prices were due mostly tohigh infrastructure costs and the need to build more power plantsto cover peak electricity demands in the summer.   Regarding air fares, the report said in September 1988 atraveler in the United States, Britain or France buying a ticket toTokyo paid only 74 percent to 82 percent of the price that a ticketon the same route cost if bought in Tokyo. But early this month thetraveler outside Japan was paying 109 percent to 125 percent of theTokyo-bought fare.   The report attributed the reversal to the gradual lowering ofyen-based air fares under market pressure, and to the weakening ofthe yen, from 134 to the dollar in September 1988 to 153 in earlyJuly. The yen recently has strengthened somewhat and closed at148.50 against the dollar on Monday.   The Japanese consumer suffers from high prices on importedgoods, the report said. American goods sell for 30 percent to 40percent more in Japan than in other countries, and European goodswere 30 percent to 50 percent higher than in their countries oforigin and 20 percent higher than in the United States.   The report blamed the difference partly on foreign companies'strategy of charging high prices because Japanese consumers wantprestige brand names at almost any cost. Also responsible werecosts of adapting foreign products to Japanese standards, high landand labor costs and the practice of sole import agents imposingstandard prices, it said.</TEXT></DOC>
