Cohen   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/25/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B8</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)SECURITIES (SCR)BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)</IN><GV>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   NEW YORK -- A federal judge ordered the government torelease to the news media today an edited version of itssentencing memorandum concerning Michael Milken, who isscheduled to be sentenced next Monday.   The memorandum, filed in court under seal this month,contains information about the six securities fraud-relatedcrimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty in April and a hostof other alleged crimes that the government believes hecommitted. The memo, designed to encourage federal JudgeKimba Wood to impose a stiff sentence on the former DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chief, is more than 200 pageslong.</LP><TEXT>   In her order making the memorandum public, Judge Woodordered the government to delete names of unindictedco-conspirators and of other individuals and entities whoremain under investigation. Judge Wood also orderedprosecutors to delete the portions of the memo that relate toMr. Milken's brother, Lowell Milken.   Lowell Milken was charged with securities and tax fraud inan indictment filed last year, but the government agreed todismiss all charges against Lowell Milken when his brotheragreed to plead guilty.   Meanwhile, Michael Milken's lawyers said they wouldrelease their client's own memorandum, which seeks to rebutmany of the government's charges, today. Mr. Milken'sattorneys had sought to bar the release of either of thememos until the sentencing.   Lawyers for Mr. Milken argued that early release of thememos could lead to &quot;improper pressure&quot; on the court. ButJudge Wood said that &quot;delaying release may well prejudice theability of the press to understand the substance&quot; of thegovernment's allegations. She added, &quot;I'm not going to beinfluenced by any publicity.&quot;   It appears that the government's memorandum contains muchinformation that has never been made public. Yesterdayafternoon, lawyers for three &quot;John Does&quot; filed sealed memoswith the court asking that the government refrain fromreleasing portions of the government's sentencing memo thatrefer to their clients. The identities of the three clientsisn't known, and none of the three law firms has everappeared before on documents filed in connection with thecase against Mr. Milken.   Still unresolved yesterday was whether Judge Wood, inhanding down a sentence, would even consider the allegationsof wrongdoing beyond the crimes to which Mr. Milken pleadedguilty. If she agrees to the government's request that sheconsider the further allegations, Mr. Milken would beentitled to a hearing in which he could seek to defendhimself. Regardless of whether additional allegations areconsidered, the maximum sentence for his crimes is 28 yearsin prison. But the sentencing judge has wide discretionwithin that limitation.   One of the six counts to which Mr. Milken pleaded guiltyinvolves a conspiracy he engaged in with convicted formerstock speculator Ivan Boesky to violate the law. Judge Woodsaid that neither the government's nor Mr. Milken'ssentencing memos provided enough information to determine theextent of the conspiracy without a hearing.   Arthur Liman, an attorney for Mr. Milken, said he wouldsubmit additional details of Mr. Milken's illegal activitiesinvolving Mr. Boesky by tomorrow.</TEXT></DOC>
