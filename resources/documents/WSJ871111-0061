Tri-State, which had total assets of $11 million, was closed yesterday by federal banking authorities, and the FDIC was named receiver. The bank had $10.8 million in 43,000 deposit accounts, including $1,400 in three accounts that exceeded the federal insurance limit of $100,000 per depositor.    The acquiring bank is paying $277,400 for the right to receive Tri-State's insured deposits and will purchase other assets of the failed bank for $3.1 million.    Two banks have failed in South Dakota this year, and 157 nationwide. </TEXT></DOC>
