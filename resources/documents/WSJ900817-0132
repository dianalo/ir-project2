Jack Kemp andDan Quayle have steamed through; Oliver North and, possibly,George Bush, are on the way.   Their goal -- to elect a Republican to Congress -- isn'tunusual, but their vessel is: The candidate, Ken Blackwell,is a black conservative.</LP><TEXT>   For decades, Republicans have had little success extendingtheir influence into the black community. Indeed, no blackRepublican has been elected to the House as a voting membersince GOP Rep. Oscar De Priest of Chicago, who was unseatedin 1934 by Republican-turned-New-Deal-Democrat ArthurMitchell (himself the first black Democrat elected toCongress).   This year, the party is attempting to turn that historicaltide with three black candidates for the House: Gary Franks,a Waterbury, Conn., alderman pitted against former Rep. TobyMoffett; Al Brown, a Louisville, Ky., businessman challengingRep. Romano Mazzoli; and Mr. Blackwell, a former Cincinnatimayor and, until last March, a deputy undersecretary at theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development under Mr. Kemp.Of the three, it is Mr. Blackwell -- who blends opposition totaxes, gay rights and abortion with support for affirmativeaction -- who excites conservative activists the most.   To win, he must beat a formidable opponent: Charles Luken,the current mayor of Cincinnati and son of the popular,conservative Democratic incumbent. When Rep. Tom Lukenannounced in January that he wouldn't seek another term,Charles Luken was judged a shoo-in to succeed him. Convincedby Ohio Republicans that Mr. Blackwell was the man to beatCharles Luken, Washington party officials recruited the HUDofficial for the job. He declared his candidacy, returned toCincinnati in March, and now finds himself in a very closerace.   Mr. Blackwell has traveled a unique route to his currentcandidacy. A student activist and president of theAfrican-American Student Association at Cincinnati's XavierUniversity in the 1960s, Mr. Blackwell agitated for morecourses in black studies and more minority hires. After abrief professional football stint with the Dallas Cowboys,Mr. Blackwell became an administrator and psychology teacherat Xavier, then ran for city council on the reformistCharterite ticket in 1977.   As late as 1980, Mr. Blackwell was a strong supporter ofJimmy Carter; at one news conference, he joined several urbanpoliticians in denouncing Ronald Reagan as a &quot;disaster&quot; forurban America. One year later, however, Mr. Blackwell leftthe city's Charter Party to become a Republican and committedReagan supporter. A leading catalyst in persuading him tomake the switch was Jack Kemp, whom he met at a NationalFootball League function in 1979. &quot;Kemp was constantlysending me speeches and working papers,&quot; Mr. Blackwellrecalls as he sits in a quiet corner of Cincinnati'swalnut-paneled Queen City Club, where he is waiting to meettwo business-community supporters. When Mr. Kemp became HUDsecretary, he brought his protege to Washington.   Today, Mr. Blackwell styles himself as a social andeconomic conservative. He's a supply-side true believer,advocating a cut in capital-gains taxes to 15% from as muchas 33%. Limiting taxation is the &quot;best way to check the sizeof government,&quot; Mr. Blackwell says. At HUD, he was a strongadvocate for tenant purchase and ownership of public housingas a means of &quot;empowerment&quot; for the poor.   Mr. Blackwell takes a hard-right line on most socialissues as well. He opposes legalized abortion, and led asuccessful city council crusade to require local hospitals toprovide for &quot;humane&quot; disposal of fetuses such as burial orincineration. (The measure was subsequently struck down infederal court.) He opposes the civil-rights bill currentlybeing constructed by Congress, arguing it amounts to &quot;quotalegislation.&quot; But he still maintains he's for affirmativeaction when it's &quot;legitimate and fair.&quot;   Democratic candidate Charles Luken is campaigning as aconservative too, opposing abortion and favoring a cut incapital-gains taxes to 22%. In an ironic twist, Mr. Lukenpositions himself as the anti-Washington figure in thiscontest, despite the fact that his father served eight termsin Congress and has long been a major recipient ofspecial-interest campaign contributions.   Both candidates will spend a lot of money as fat-catcontributors and special interests line up to donate in aclose race with no incumbent. Mr. Blackwell says he alreadyhas raised almost half of his $750,000 target and last monthbegan running a television ad touting his rise from&quot;working-class origins&quot; to membership in the Bushadministration.   Although the elder Mr. Luken has held this seat since1976, the district, which includes suburbs as well as thewestern part of Cincinnati, is more a Republican one; GeorgeBush won with 63% of the vote in 1988. In a reversal of theusual calculus, it's the black candidate who expects hisstrongest showing in the suburbs, home to German-CatholicRepublicans who long ago abandoned Cincinnati's&quot;Over-the-Rhine&quot; neighborhood. &quot;Good luck to you,&quot; chirps oneelderly white man as Mr. Blackwell passes out refrigeratormagnets in front of the Green Township Thriftway.   But Mr. Blackwell also hopes to split the black vote --somewhere around 15% -- despite his Republican label. EdBrookover, regional field representative for the NationalRepublican Congressional Committee, contends that Mr.Blackwell has the ability to &quot;connect with the blackcommunity while representing the strong conservative valuesthat our party stands for.&quot;   Not surprisingly, however, the GOP candidate'sconservatism rankles some of the city's black leaders. &quot;Hevotes against the interests of his own community,&quot; complainsMarian Spencer, a Charterite and former city council memberwho attributes Mr. Blackwell's party switch to opportunism.And he's taking flack for his association with Oliver North,who reportedly will be paid $8,000 to come in to stump forthe Republican contender. Charterite City Councilman ReggieWilliams -- a former starting linebacker for the CincinnatiBengals and someone who has been wooed by nationalRepublicans, too -- draws a pointed parallel: &quot;I rememberwhen Sammy Davis was embracing Richard Nixon. That turned afew stomachs.&quot;   But Councilman Williams still is leaning toward supportingMr. Blackwell, and the conservative black congressionalcandidate doesn't seem in a mood to trim his sails. Forinstance, he rejects the &quot;bleeding-heart conservative&quot; labelattached to his mentor, Jack Kemp, explaining that on certainissues such as organized labor, &quot;Kemp is to the left of me.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
