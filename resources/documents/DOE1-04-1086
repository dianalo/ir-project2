<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-04-1086 </DOCNO><TEXT>Infrared spectroscopy was used to study interaction of CoM(CO)/sub 2/(NO){pi}-complexes, where M=Cr, Mo, Cp=eta/sup 5/-C/sub 5/H/sub 5/, withperfluorotert butanol (PFTB) and HCl in liquid Xe solutions at low temperatures.It is shown that mentioned complexes can form earlier unknown type ofhydrogen bond with PFTB and HCl by oxygen atom of nitrosyl group of transitionmetal atom. Protonation of complexes dissolved in liquid Xe by transitionmetal atom during their interaction with HCl was reveald.</TEXT></DOC>
