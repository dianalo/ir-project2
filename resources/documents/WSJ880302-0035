Burden-sharing is a shorthand way of saying the U.S.'s allies in Europe and Japan should pay more for their own defense so the U.S. can pay less. With voters thinking that the economy is being knocked for a loop by Japanese and West German competitors, the idea has political appeal that is being tapped by candidates ranging from Republican Robert Dole to Democrat Jesse Jackson.    But while candidates are finding it easy to say they will force Europe and Japan to pay more, their burden-sharing pledges appear to clash with their promises to improve conventional defenses in Europe. To some, burden-sharing also implies a decline in U.S. power that contradicts most candidates' rhetoric about world leadership. And the issue of burden-sharing can pose a special problem for Democrats trying to shed the image that they are unwilling to mount a stout national defense.    &quot;I don't think one should waste any time in any serious discussion about it (burden-sharing) talking about what the candidates are saying,&quot; Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former U.S. national security adviser, says. &quot;I don't frankly think there has been any serious discussion of defense policy in the campaign.&quot;    The topic of burden-sharing is sure to be seriously discussed in Europe this week, however, as President Reagan meets in Brussels today and tomorrow with heads of other North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations.    The most obvious problem in the candidates' pledges lies in their conflicting promises about burden-sharing and a stronger conventional defense. At the same time that most candidates are promising to shift more of the defense burden onto allied shoulders, they are pledging to build up conventional armed strength in Europe so they can safely negotiate deep cuts in nuclear arms.    In effect, candidates are promising both to do more, by building up conventional strength, and to do less, by forcing the responsibility onto allies.    &quot;There's no way to bridge that gap with complete intellectual honesty,&quot; says John Buckley, spokesman for Republican Rep. Jack Kemp, who isn't emphasizing burden-sharing as much as other candidates.    Democrat Michael Dukakis, for example, has issued a position paper on national security saying, &quot;My top priority for building a strong national defense will be to improve our conventional forces, together with our allies.&quot; But in the same paper, he also declares: &quot;The European economy now rivals that of the U.S., and our European (as well as Japanese) allies must bear their fair share of the common defense effort.&quot;    Other candidates make strikingly similar statements. But looking for Western Europe to make the conventional-force improvements that all candidates agree are necessary is hardly a sure-fire route to success, as the Europeans have been notoriously reluctant to increase defense spending significantly.    There may be a way to resolve the conflict, but it would require a level of Soviet cooperation a candidate can't guarantee. If the U.S. could negotiate significant cuts in the Soviets' superior conventional forces in Europe, a future president would find it easier both to shift more of the burden to the Europeans and to modernize the leaner U.S. force that would remain in Europe.    &quot;One possibility for easing some of the burden, obviously, would be to at least put (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev to the test,&quot; says Robert Ellsworth, former NATO ambassador and a close adviser to Sen. Dole, who discussed burden-sharing in the speech announcing his candidacy.    &quot;Mr. Gorbachev has been speaking for a year and a half about asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces,&quot; Mr. Ellsworth says. &quot;NATO's response has been weak and piecemeal and never very much.&quot;    Sen. Dole's main Republican rival, Vice President George Bush, hasn't discussed burden-sharing much, but a spokesman says Mr. Bush agrees that &quot;it's something that has to be considered.&quot; He didn't elaborate.    The topic is particularly tricky for the Democrats, who are trying to combat an image of being unwilling to maintain a strong defense posture.    &quot;I believe Democrats have to be very careful in addressing the issue,&quot; Kirk O'Donnell, who heads the Center for National Policy, a Democratic research group, says. He even is troubled by the term &quot;burden-sharing,&quot; fearing that Democrats can be hurt by the implication they consider defense a burden rather than a responsibility.    Sen. Albert Gore, who portrays himself as the toughest Democratic presidential candidate on defense, tries to overcome that problem by arguing that he could share defense burdens without having to &quot;precipitously back away from&quot; longstanding U.S. obligations in Europe and Asia.    &quot;We aren't going to do that,&quot; Mr. Gore says. &quot;But we must make it clear that nations (that are) now economic giants must pay a larger share of the cost of defending Europe and Asia.&quot;    A similar difficulty is that burden-sharing implies a reduced world role for the U.S., something candidates don't like to admit.    &quot;The problem with burden-sharing politically is it also means power-sharing, and Americans have never wanted to power-share,&quot; says Rep. Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat who raised the issue prominently in her own short-lived presidential campaign.    That dilemma gives rise to clashing campaign images of the U.S. For instance, Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) proclaims in one speech that he would &quot;rebuild America's true place in the world,&quot; then says in another that &quot;the common defense need no longer be a disproportionately American burden.&quot;    Rep. Gephardt may have another contradiction to overcome. He says that if elected, he would press Japan to pay more for defense. But at the same time, he would be angering Japan with his hard-nosed trade policies.    ---                       Defense Outlays    Military spending as a percentage of total output of goods and services*    United States                        6.6%    United Kingdom                       5.1%    West Germany                         3.1%    Belgium                              2.8%    Italy                                2.3%    Japan                                1.0%    *1986    Source: Center for Defense Information</TEXT></DOC>
