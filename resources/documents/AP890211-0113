The 17 were convicted in 1984 of bombing the French and Americanembassies and given sentences ranging from five years to death. TheIslamic Jihad, which holds two American hostages, has demandedfreedom for all 17. Kuwait has refused.   Interior Minister Sheik Salem al-Sabah said the two freed men,Abdul-Mohsen Rashash Abbas, 25, an Iraqi, and 30-year-old NasserMatar Dahash, whose family lives in Kuwait without officialcitizenship, were released ``a while ago, having completed theirprison terms.''   The two are not considered key figures in the long-runninghostage drama. Salem did not say what date they were freed or wherethey are now.   But Kuwait's information minister, Sheik Jaber Mubarak, told TheAssociated Press in December the pair would be freed after theyfinished their sentences and would be deported to the country oftheir choice.   Salem stressed to reporters the release ``has nothing to do withthe demands of extremist organizations.''   Despite recent speculation that some of the 15 hostages, whoinclude nine Americans, might soon be freed, informed Arab sourcessaid there was no sign any were about to be released. Most of theLebanese captives are held by Shiite extremists.   Islamic Jihad, believed made up of Shiite Moslem extremists loyalto Iran, kidnapped Terry Anderson of Lorain, Ohio, on March 16,1985, and Thomas Sutherland, 57, of Fort Collins, Colo. on June 9the same year. The group has released four other Americans.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, is the longest-held of the hostages in Lebanon.   In Washington, the State Department said it had no comment on theterrorists' release.   The 17 bombers _ Kuwaitis, Iraqis and Lebanese _ were arrestedand tried after the December 1983 bombings of the U.S. and Frenchembassies and Kuwaiti government installations.   Three were sentenced to death but have not been executed, and 12were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 years to life.   The two released were handed the shortest sentences and are notbelieved central to Islamic Jihad's demand for the release of the 17.   Among the bombers sentenced to death is Mustapha YoussefBadreddin, a cousin and brother-in-law of Imad Mugniyeh, said to bethe leader of Islamic Jihad. He was convicted under the alias ofElias Fuad Saab.   One of those serving life is Hassan Youssef Musawi, a cousin ofHussein Musawi, leader of another Iranian-linked Shiite faction inLebanon.   Since their 1984 trial, extremists have hijacked two Kuwaitairliners to press for the release of their comrades. Kuwait hasrefused to negotiate.   In December 1984, a Kuwait Airways plane was seized on a flightfrom Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, to Karachi, Pakistan, andwas flown to Tehran. The hijackers killed two American passengersand vanished after Iranian security men stormed the plane to end thesix-day ordeal.   A Kuwaiti Boeing 747 was hijacked April 5, 1988 on aBangkok-Kuwait flight. It was flown first to Iran, then to Larnaca,Cyprus, where the hijackers killed two Kuwaiti hostages.   The plane was later flown to Algiers, Algeria, where the 16-daysaga ended with the hijackers freeing the hostages and the plane,apparently in return for safe conduct out of the country.   Mugniyeh, wanted by U.S. authorities as one of four LebaneseShiites who hijacked a TWA jet in June 1985 and killed an Americanserviceman, is believed to have masterminded last year's KuwaitAirways hijacking.   Iran had accused Kuwait of aiding Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war.   Kuwaiti officials blamed Iran for the 1983 bombings and otheracts of sabotage in Kuwait. Relations with Tehran began improvinglast year after a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire between Iran and Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
