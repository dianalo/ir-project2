McBirney III, former owner of SunbeltSavings Association of Texas, has agreed to plead guilty tofederal criminal charges and the agreement will be filedtoday, his defense attorney said. The filing would come lessthan 24 hours after a jury convicted Don R. Dixon, ex-ownerof Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association.   Messrs. McBirney and Dixon have been among thehighest-priority targets of the U.S. Justice Department's waron thrift fraud because of their gaudy life styles and themillions of dollars in losses racked up by their thrifts.Winning the cases against two such high-profile defendants isa major coup for the Justice Department's oft-criticizedDallas Bank Fraud Task Force.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dixon was convicted yesterday of 23 federal criminalcharges, most of them related to the use of Vernon funds tolease a California beach house for the thrift owner. Three ofthe charges related to thrift funds that paid for prostitutesfor Vernon board members. The charges carry a maximumpossible prison term of 120 years.   Mr. Dixon was acquitted of 15 other charges relating tothe use of thrift funds to reimburse Vernon employees forpolitical campaign contributions and out-of-state trips withthe former commissioner of the Texas Savings and LoanDepartment.   None of the charges against Mr. Dixon dealt with any ofthe questionable loans and real estate transactions that ledto Vernon's losses of almost $2 billion and its collapse in1987. Because the charges against Mr. Dixon dealt withrelatively low-dollar expenditures, his attorney, William M.Ravkind, predicted throughout the trial and almost nine daysof jury deliberations that Mr. Dixon would be acquitted.   After the verdict yesterday, Mr. Dixon was ordered jailedwithout bond until his sentencing in February, and anembittered Mr. Ravkind said, &quot;I should have pleaded himguilty.&quot;   The possibility of a substantial prison term following aguilty verdict may have prompted Mr. McBirney's expected pleaagreement. The former Sunbelt Savings owner faced a maximumpossible sentence of 85 years in prison if convicted of all17 charges filed against him in his July 11 indictment.   Mr. McBirney's attorney, Paul E. Coggins of Dallas, saidthe plea agreement will be filed in federal court in Dallastoday. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Itwasn't known what specific charges Mr. McBirney was expectedto admit or what the terms of his plea would be.   But in previous plea agreements with thrift executives,the Justice Department has required defendants to cooperatein other investigations. Mr. McBirney's cooperation, ifrequired, could be extremely valuable to prosecutors becauseof his extensive dealings with other thrifts and theirexecutives.   Among the now-failed thrifts that were involved in realestate and loan transactions with Sunbelt and Mr. McBirneywere San Jacinto Savings Association of Houston, a unit ofSouthmark Corp. until its recent seizure by thriftregulators; Independent American Savings Assocation, whichwas owned by Thomas R. Gaubert of Dallas; and Western SavingsAssociation of Dallas, formerly owned by Jarrett E. Woods Jr.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation has acknowledged anongoing criminal investigation of San Jacinto, and Mr.Gaubert has remained a target of federal prosecutors despitehis acquittal in October 1988 on charges related to loansfrom an Iowa thrift. Mr. Woods is scheduled for trial inJanuary on 37 charges related to the failure of WesternSavings. If convicted, he would face a maximum possiblesentence of 185 years in prison.</TEXT></DOC>
