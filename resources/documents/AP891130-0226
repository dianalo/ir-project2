In addition, the machine would need just 1 second to perform 1trillion mathematical operations _ such as additions ormultiplications.   ``You could tally up the national debt in 1 second,'' Hillissaid.   Hillis is co-founder and chief scientist of Thinking MachinesCorp. in Cambridge. The company announced this week it was getting$12 million from the Pentagon to develop a supercomputer that works1,000 times faster than standard models now available and more than100 times faster than the top machines.   Thinking Machines said it was receiving the government moneyfrom the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency,which has been awarding grants aimed at keeping the United Statesthe world leader in high-speed supercomputers.   Hillis said he expects the project to be completed by themid-1990s, but his company hopes to have a smaller version ready topresent to the Pentagon in 1992.   Thinking Machines uses a process called parallel computing, inwhich smaller computers work separately to solve small pieces ofbigger problems. The company's current models contain about 64,000smaller computers, but the new machine could use up to 1 millionprocessors.   Other supercomputer makers, such as world leading Cray ResearchInc., use parallel processing to a much smaller extent.   Instead, they do large chunks of problems and work quickly fromone facet to the next, said Bob Trier, director of technicalprograms for Research Consortium Inc., a Minneapolis-based companythat studies the supercomputer market for users and vendors.   While machines that use parallel processing can do manycalculations at once, they also are tailored more to solvingspecific problems and are less flexible in their uses, Trier said.   Also, he said, some complex mathematical problems must be solvedone step at a time and do not lend themselves to parallelprocessing.   But Hillis said his company, which has been growing about 50percent a year and provides computers for the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration, will produce machines that have manyapplications.   For example, he said, the supercomputers can performcalculations in human genetics, can help design microchips and evensimulate how a car will work before it is built.   ``Some problems literally would take a year to do (on currentcomputers),'' Hillis said. ``If it takes a year to do, you might aswell build the car.''   By contrast, the new computer would take only a few hours tosolve such problems, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
