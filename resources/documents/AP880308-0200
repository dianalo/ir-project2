The measure failed by a vote of 10-2, with France, West Germanyand Japan abstaining.   The resolution would have imposed mandatory worldwide sanctions,including an oil embargo, for a year.   All the speakers deplored South Africa's state of emergency andrecent restrictions on anti-apartheid groups.   In their speeches, the representatives of France and Italycondemned Pretoria's ban on activities by major anti-apartheidgroups and urged dialogue between the white-led government and theblack majority. However, the representatives did not endorsemandatory sanctions.   The United States and some other Western nations have opposedsimilar measures in the past. The five permanent members of theSecurity Council _ the United States, Britain, China, France andthe Soviet Union _ have veto power.   The resolution proposed a ban on export and sale of oil to SouthAfrica, the discontinuation of iron and steel imports from SouthAfrica, an end to loans to South Africa, a ban on sale of coinsminted in South Africa and a halt to all military, police orintelligence cooperation with South Africa.   In Johannesburg, Foreign Minister Pik Botha said on nationaltelevision that ``I wrote the words'' used by South Africa's U.N.ambassador, Leslie Manley, last Thursday when he told the council,``Do your damnedest.''   ``Either we're strong enough to withstand and resist theonslaught against us or we're not,'' Botha said.   The draft resolution invoked Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter,which provides for economic sanctions and other measures wheninternational peace and security are threatened.   Last Thursday the council opened a debate to condemn SouthAfrica's ban Feb. 24 on activities by major anti-apartheid groups.It is expected to pass a resolution expressing outrage andcondemnation.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
