 Software, either included with the input hardware or availablefrom third-party vendors, converts and stores the input on a system's disk.andM;Unlike the keyboard, mouse or digitizing tablet, handwriting-recognitionhardware and software are not yet the generally accepted mode of data input.andM;Vertical-market applications are appearing, however, in the laboratoryresearch and medical fields, where handwriting-recognition products are idealfor data collection.andP;  In business offices, these products are used for dataentry and inventory management.andM;The handwriting-recognition product market is new and small.andP;  Buyers of thesedevices are charting a new course, said Simon Wieczner, a product manager forPencept Inc., a handwriting-recognition vendor in Waltham, Mass.andM;Handwriting recognition is a viable input alternative because of fasterprocessing speeds of computers, said James Logan, president of MicroTouchSystems Inc. in Woburn, Mass., maker of ScreenWriter, ahandwriting-recognition digitizer.andP;  ''The essential level of the technologyhas been about the same for a while, but because of more powerful PCs,handwriting recognition is much more feasible now,'' he said.andM;A buyer looking into handwriting recognition, Logan explained, has two areasto consider: ''opaque'' products and ''transparent tablets.''andM;''Opaque products are the type where the user is filling out a form, and Idon't think those products offer much of a gain because of the limitations ofhandwritten input,'' Logan said.andM;One opaque product, ScriptWriter, from Data Entry Systems Inc. in Huntsville,Ala., looks like a standard clipboard.andM;A paper form is placed on the clipboard, and the user writes on the form witha ballpoint pen.andP;  As the user writes, Scriptwriter recognizes the handwritingand the area of the form that is being filled in.andP;  Recognized charactersinclude standard uppercase printed letters, numbers, punctuation and specialcharacters.andP;  Keyed-in data is displayed on ScriptWriter's LCD screen.andP;  Errorsare corrected by writing over the original characters.andM;Opaque products have a speed constraint because they have to be programmed torecognize the user's handwriting.andP;  The user is often allowed to write only inpredefined areas on the form.andM;The second class of products, transparent tablets, ''comes closer to trueelectronic paper, where the device fits [directly] over a flat-screen[display terminal], and the user writes directly on the screen with anelectronic stylus,'' Logan explained.andM;The Linus Write-Top, a custom portable computer from Linus Technologies Inc.andO;in Reston, Va., uses a transparent tablet.andM;With the Write-Top, the user writes on a flat LCD screen, which has atransparent glass overlay.andP;  Handwritten data, signatures and sketches can bedigitized without a keyboard or mouse.andM;An adaptive software algorithm in the Write-Top recognizes any handwrittensymbol, including shorthand and scientific notation, and converts it to ASCIItext.andM;According to Pencept's Wieczner, buyers must consider the software'srecognition method.andM;The ''adaptive'' method requires that the user program thehandwriting-recognition device to recognize handwritten characters.andP;  ''Withthe adaptive method, the system becomes customized to one user's style,''said Wieczner.andM;The ''stored'' method uses handwriting-recognition software that is smartenough to recognize how most people create written characters.andP;  ''As long asyou write in a more or less standard manner, the stored method will pick itup,'' said Wieczner.andP;  He admitted, however, that users might have to changehow they write certain letters.andM;Lessons in PenmanshipandM;''You can realize what you have done differently if the system doesn'trecognize it, but we feel the stored method generates greater accuracy,'' hesaid.andM;Another consideration is whether the product allows the user to writefreehand, said Tim Buchholz, manager of marketing services at LinusTechnologies.andP;  Most handwriting-recognition technologies require the user toenter data in predefined blocks.andM;''Writing in blocks means the user has to conform to the computer's idea ofhandwriting, while with our product [the Write-Top], you can write much asyou would on a piece of paper,'' Buchholz said.andM;The quality and type of the actual input device is also important, claimedWieczner.andP;  Most products use a mechanical stylus; a poor stylus can cause thedevice to misread the input, he said.andM;----------Jon Pepper, a frequent contributor to PC Week, lives in westernMassachusetts.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
