Anytimean issue is shrouded with so many uncertainties, the formulation of policyon it is likely to drift from one legislative impasse to the next underperiods of normality, a situation that is referred to as paralysis ofpluralism. The supply shortages in 1979-1980 radically altered the statusof synfuels. Necessity for action appeared urgent and top decision makersviewed synfuels as vital to acquiring independence from unpredictableforeign energy sources, and they committed enormous capital. They (orat least those legislators who were highly critical of synfuels in 1975and 1976) took this action with considerable ambivalence since a massivedevelopment of synfuels carried so many uncertainties. However, thisambivalence worked against synfuels policy in 1981 when Congress didnot object to a reduced commitment of federal government to this option.This unusual treatment of policy requires a special analytical framework;one for purposes of this discussion is called the ambivalent-majoritarianresponse. There are four theoretical underpinnings to this approach.</TEXT></DOC>
