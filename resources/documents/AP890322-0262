Thursday's issue of the tabloid, whose early editions wereavailable Wednesday night, said the possible threat was detailed ina secret memorandum dated last Friday from the U.S. Federal AviationAdministration. The paper said it was given a copy of the memo.   In Washington, FAA officials declined comment on the report. Butother officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed thatthe memo had been issued.   The officials said the FAA had not issued a general warning, butinstead had sent out ``non-specific alert'' dealing with threeLebanese suspects.   Reporter Robert McGowan, in what the paper called an exclusivereport, said the memorandum named three Lebanese terrorists believedto be traveling on forged passports.   ``A worldwide security operation was under way to foil ahijacking,'' the report said. ``American military personnel anddiplomats and their families have been told of the threat, whichcenters on U.S. airlines. They were advised to alter routine plansto return home from Europe for Easter.''   The report says the memo warns all airlines and security forcesin the United States, Britain and the rest of Europe and was passedto the British Department of Transport in London.   ``Security sources confirmed to me ... that the hijack warningwas genuine,'' McGowan wrote. ``Dated March 17, it arrived at theKnightsbridge, London, offices of International Aviation Security, acompany owned by Trans World Airlines.''   The paper printed part of the memorandum. It read: ``ThreatInformation. Received 17.03.1989 From FAA. Subject: Hijacking Threat.   ``Possible: 3 Lebanese Palestinians may try to hijack a U.S.airliner in Europe. Possible names: Jamel Hahmud Talid Muhammed:Ahmed Muhammad Salim Abuzayni: Khalour Muhammed Jafar.   ``Alias passports: Bahrain, Pakistan, North Yemen, possiblegenuine@forged or altered.   ``Above information credible although not confirmed.''
