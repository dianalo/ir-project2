A new nationwide Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll indicates less a major surge in voters' views of Mr. Bush than a wearing-off of some of the luster Mr. Dukakis gained from his own convention last month. The survey, conducted last Friday through Monday, followed a concerted GOP counterattack against Mr. Dukakis on issues ranging from national security to his medical records.    The poll shows that Mr. Dukakis still leads the presidential race by a margin of 49% to 39% among those people who are considered likely to vote in November. But that 10-point margin is down from the 17-point spread registered by a Journal/NBC poll taken just after the Democratic convention.    Among all registered voters, Mr. Dukakis holds a larger, 50%-to-36%, lead, down slightly from his 18-point lead in the previous poll. However, this close to the election, most poll takers consider likely voters to be a better measurement.    Mr. Bush's favorable/unfavorable rating -- a key barometer of how a candidate is generally perceived by voters -- stands at 47% favorable to 43% unfavorable, the survey found. Just after the Democratic convention, where speaker after speaker pummeled the vice president, his ratings stood at 44% favorable, 46% unfavorable. The figure in the latest survey is almost identical with Mr. Bush's ratings just prior to the Democratic parley.    Mr. Bush improved his standing among male voters, from a slight deficit two weeks ago to being equal with Mr. Dukakis now. But the vice president still suffers from a huge gender gap, trailing by 34% to Mr. Dukakis's 53% among likely women voters.    Regionally, Mr. Bush has pulled even in the South and the West and somewhat narrowed Mr. Dukakis's big lead in the East. But the Democratic nominee continues to enjoy a huge edge in the Midwest.    The poll suggests one reason for the vice president's problems is that he is attracting blame for several of the Reagan administration's shortcomings, while failing to get corresponding credit for some of its successes.    For instance, the poll found that a majority of voters think the vice president was &quot;very involved&quot; in the Iran-Contra affair, and a plurality of voters think he was very involved in the big run-up in the federal budget deficit under President Reagan. Nearly four in 10 voters think he was very involved in the scandals linked to various administration appointees. The same number give him credit for a major role in getting inflation under control. Only one in three likely voters thinks he was very involved in the administration's efforts to cut taxes.    A majority of voters do feel the vice president had a big role in helping build up U.S. military strength over the last eight years, and he continues to lead the Democratic nominee by large margins as the candidate better able to maintain a strong national defense and to handle relations with the Soviet Union. But Mr. Dukakis is still seen as the candidate somewhat better able to manage the nation's economic, drug and crime problems.    More importantly, the Massachusetts governor continues to be seen as a stronger leader than the vice president. By a margin of 52% to 36%, likely voters think the Democratic nominee would be as strong a leader as Ronald Reagan has been, while by a margin of 45% to 42% they think George Bush wouldn't be.    As with Mr. Bush, the Journal/NBC survey found that Mr. Dukakis's favorable/unfavorable rating has settled back into its pre-Democratic Convention range. In the latest poll, 55% of likely voters say they have a favorable view of him, and 26% an unfavorable one. In a survey taken just before the Democratic Convention the Massachusetts governor was rated favorably by 58% to 25%; immediately after the convention the figures had risen to 62%-18% favorable.    One of the vice president's major tasks at the GOP convention will be to convince voters that he understands their needs and concerns. By a margin of better than two to one, likely voters in the Journal/NBC poll currently say that Mr. Dukakis cares about people like them; 45% say Mr. Bush cares about people like them, while 43% say he doesn't. GOP speakers also will hammer at the notion that Mr. Dukakis is a big-spending, big-taxing liberal: Already, 60% of voters say they think their taxes will go up if Mr. Dukakis is elected, while only 43% think taxes will go up if Mr. Bush wins. However, when asked if they think taxes will rise no matter who wins, an overwhelming majority said yes.    Senate minority leader Robert Dole was the most popular choice among six potential vice presidential running mates; 37% say they would most like to see him as the choice, while 12% would like him least. Rep. Jack Kemp is the first choice of 16% and the least favorite of 13%; Sen. Dole's wife, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, is the favorite of 12% and the least favorite of 16%.    The survey found a high degree of awareness of the controversy over Mr. Dukakis's health records that briefly flared last week: two-thirds of likely voters had heard or read of it. But by a margin of six to one, those voters say Mr. Dukakis -- who has denied seeking psychiatric counseling -- is telling the truth about his mental-health history. And seven out of 10 think the reports are the result of &quot;dirty tricks by political opponents.&quot;    One reason for Mr. Dukakis's continuing lead in the trial-heat aspect of the Journal/NBC poll is his standing among those voters who are most up for grabs. To get at the sentiment of such voters, The Wall Street Journal analysed responses of a &quot;swing group&quot; that includes Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984 and who still approve of the president's job performance, independent voters, and Democrats and Republicans who haven't yet decided who they want for president this year.    Voters in this group aren't quite as desirous of changing course from Mr. Reagan's policies as are other voters. Nonetheless, they give Mr. Dukakis decidedly higher marks as a strong leader, and give him a favorable/unfavorable rating of 56% to 22%, compared with 46% to 36% for Vice President Bush.    Among all Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984, Mr. Dukakis leads the race by 59% to 25%, compared with a 61%-17% margin in the most recent previous poll. Among independents, he leads by 47% to 32%, compared to a 38%-29% lead earlier.    ---   &quot;I am going to read you a list of several issues the Reagan administration has been involved in.
