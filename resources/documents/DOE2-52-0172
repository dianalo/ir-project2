Thisassumption, a version of the Weisskopf--Wigner assumption of a broadenergy spectrum, makes it possible to obtain detailed expressions forthe time development of the decaying system. It is shown to follow fromquantum electrodynamics, with no further assumptions, for spontaneousemission by atoms. It is used to give simple and intuitive treatmentsof spontaneous emission and resonance fluorescence, in the Schroedingerpicture and with the focus on photons rather than electromagnetic fieldvalues. The time dependence of the lineshape is discussed, and it isshown that the effect of detection of photons at finite times after emissionis to give an overall lineshape which is not Lorentzian. copyright 1988Academic Press, Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
