JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An environmental group said Tuesday new lawsare needed to prevent chemical companies from manufacturing highlytoxic pesticides banned in this country and sending them abroad.   The practice ``has created a circle of poison'' where in somecases food tainted by the toxic chemicals is imported into theUnited States and sold to consumers, said Sandra Marquardt, who hasfollowed the issue for the environmental group Greenpeace.   Greenpeace cited the practices of the Velsicol Chemical Corp.,which from its plant in Memphis, Tenn., is the world's only producerof the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor. Both pesticides havebeen banned for agricultural use in the United States since 1978 andfor virtually all other uses in recent years because they were foundto cause cancer.   The two pesticides, which had been widely used for treatment oftermites, have been banned or severely restricted for use in 48countries because of their carcinogenic properties.   Nevertheless, said Ms. Marquardt, Velsicol exported nearly 5million pounds of the two pesticides to 25 countries between 1987and the middle of this year. More than 330,000 pounds went toArgentina and another 510,000 pounds to Australia, countries thatimport meat and other products into the United States.   In a statement issued from the chemical company's headquarters inRosemont, Ill., Velsicol called the Greenpeace report on itscontinued sale of the two pesticides abroad as ``grosslyinaccurate'' and said it remained committed to producing theproducts and shipping them abroad.   ``Forty years of product use and research conducted by scientistswho are experts in their field support the continued use ofchlordane and heptachlor,'' said Charles H. Frommer, the company'svice president of government, regulatory and public affairs.   He suggested in some cases there are no practical substitutes forthe chemicals, a contention disputed by Greenpeace.   Dr. Samuel Epstein, a professor of occupational and environmentalmedicine at the University of Illinois Medical Center, whoparticipated in a Greenpeace news conference in Washington, accusedVelsicol of failing to inform their foreign customers of the dangerposed by the two pesticides.   He accused the company of ``manipulation of information'' aboutthe two chemicals and that warning labels often are not explicit andpeople handling the pesticides not aware of precautions that shouldbe taken.   ``If these products are too toxic to be used here (in the UnitedStates), they are too toxic to be used anywhere,'' said Ms.Marquardt.   She maintained that the Food and Drug Administration and theAgriculture Department are too shorthanded to adequately monitorfood imports for content of pesticides that have been banned in thiscountry.   She said last year two shipments of beef from Honduras were foundto have been contaminated with the Velsicol pesticides. She saidheptachlor contamination also has been found in imported carrots,pineapples, garbanzo beans and cheese, although the source of thecontamination was not clear.</TEXT></DOC>
