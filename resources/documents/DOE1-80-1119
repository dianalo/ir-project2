The vast majority of the 300 samplesprepared were not metallic. Several contained known superconducting phases.In the Y-Ba-Cu-O system, many samples prepared at 1050 and 1200 C showsome partial melting and deviate strongly from the predictions of thephase diagram determined at 950 C. In a few samples, anomalous resistancedecreases were observed at temperatures as high as 260K. In each case,however, these anomalies could be directly traced to problems with stronglytemperature dependent contact resistance and phase problems due to highdegree of sample inhomogeneity. Multiphase samples prepared at the hightemperature (i.e. 1050 and 1200 C) appear most prone to such resistanceartifacts.</TEXT></DOC>
