(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>FROM THE TELEMANAGEMENT NEWS DESKandM;Account-A-CallandM;With Account-A-Call's (located in beautiful, downtown Burbank) new TUMS 2000Version V.1, you can put a &quot;mouse in-house,&quot; as they rhythmically like to putit.andM;Basically, they've made some changes in regard to the sophistication in whichyou can pump out reports.andP;  They don't have to be, like so manycall-accounting reports, ugly and drab.andP;  You can make them sexy andbeautiful.andP;  They've packaged a Logitech mouse with the new version tofacilitate the above mentioned process as well as to help you zip along indealing with the system.andM;Call Matching is also available now.andP;  It lets multi-PBX networks accuratelyprice calls throughout the network.andP;  Harmony, man.andP;  It also incorporatesreal-time call pricing, so the user sees a cost attached to each call onscreen before a data cycle is run.andM;And certain blocks of data can now be specified and printed on an &quot;ad hoc&quot;basis.andP;  For example, the user could specify all calls made by a certainextension during a specific time period.andP;  This information would appear onthe screen ready for printing.andM;Finally, for a limited time they're including TICS, their facilitiesmanagement system, with the TUMS 2000 license.andM;AnucomandM;The Energy Management option on Anucom's Inn-Tel call accounting system forhotel/motels is now integrated with the call accounting functions.andP;  In caseyou forgot, Energy Management is a unique option that lets you control airconditioners, headers, spas, lights and signs.andP;  It automatically shuts offthe appropriate devices when the guest checks out.andM;Inn-Tel also lets you automatically cut off guests' phone service after theyreach a certain billing limit when it is used with a Mitel SX-20, SX-50 or aHitachi HD-200.andP;  It will still allow 911 calls to go through, for safety'ssake.andM;The system is sold as a complete package with an IBM-XT central processingunit, a 20 Meg hard drive, a floppy drive, a modem, a monitor, a keyboard, aparallel printer and a three-hour battery backup buffer in addition to thesoftware itself.andM;The Management Strategies feature has 900 codes for property management.andO;This feature allows the maid to call in and record information about ajust-cleaned room by dialing in a code.andP;  For those with an empire of hotelsor motels, the modem allows for the transfer of data to a remote location.andM;Aud-CynandM;These guys have been offering both service bureau and CPE callaccountingsolutions for many a moon now.andP;  Big-time, full-blown stuff.andM;As to what they can now offer as a service bureau, upgrades include:andM;* three level of reports, including detail, summary and management summary;andM;* usage reports in graphic form;andM;* file maintenance software on a PC for the service bureau customer wantinginvolvement in the parameter setting for processing;andM;* &quot;sign-in&quot; ability for service bureau customer;andM;* packet-switch processing;andM;* volume discount for call processing;andM;* user-defined exception reports;andM;* megacom incoming/outgoing processing;andM;* and mail distribution of reports.andM;On the CPE side, they're offering what they call TCS-III.andP;  It'smega-callaccounting application software.andP;  The new software configurationlets a mainframe do all the processing, while a PC does all file maintenanceand polling of data.andP;  Obviously it saves on valuable CPU time.andP;  Other thingsof note:andM;* turnkey DEC VAX-based option;andM;* turnkey HP-based option;andM;* bill verification software;andM;* usage reports in graphic form;andM;* packet-switch processing;andM;* and it allows for customized programming.andM;Burnup and SimsandM;&quot;FACTS&quot; stands for FACilities Tracking System.andP;  It is a cable managementsoftware system.andP;  Two versions of the system are available.andP;  Version 1.0 is acustomized system with eight modules -- MAC System (Moves, Adds and Changes),Disconnect System, History System, Device Management, ConnectivityManagement, Token Ring Management, Directory Management and System Utilities.andM;Version 2.0 is the less expensive generic version.andP;  It includes SystemConfiguration, Pattern Definition, Backbone Connectivity, MAC Processing andSystem Utilities Modules.andP;  Both versions are for use with any universalwiringsystem scheme, but Version 1.0 is specifically for the IBM cabling scheme.andM;Version 1.0 runs on a personal computer.andP;  It provides a customized relationaldatabase to record every voice and data device, and all the cable in yourcabling system.andP;  It lets you modify this database easily so it alwaysreflects the lates moves, adds and changes.andM;Version 2.0 also runs on a personal computer.andP;  It creates and stores aprecise computer model of your communications system.andP;  You have an up-to-daterecord of cable pairs and devices so assigning new services to users is easy.andO;The system automatically generates service orders and changes the databasemodel to reflect any connectivity changes made.andM;CGIandM;Communications Group, Inc introduced their CMS/PC family of systems at TCA.andO;Here, now the perfunctory overview.andM;There are three models -- the 75, 250 and 500, each differentiated by itsstorage capacity.andP;  They are telephone management systems providing fullcall-accounting with summary reports on all telecom usage.andM;Whether your system is 10 lines or 250 lines, the family can handle you.andP;  Ithas a powerful call detail recording system.andP;  Call detail records areaccumulated from the phone system via a standard RS-232 interface andprocessed either on a scheduled or automatic basis.andM;It gives you full Vandamp;H coordinate files and city/state names.andP;  Severalstandard reports have extension, cost center and company categories.andP;  Reportson frequently called numbers, most expensive calls and longest calls can begenerated as well.andM;In addition, account code reports are provided for professionals dealing withmultiple clients, such as lawyers and accountants.andP;  You'll also get specificreports on telephone traffic, such as individual trunk usage, trunk groupusage and WATS band.andM;It's menu-driven, promising ease of use and relatively painless set up ofdatabase.andP;  Department profiles and trunk profiles can be built quickly and,again, fairly easy.andM;Each of the systems also operates in the background mode, freeing the PC torun other applications while call data is being stored.andP;  Always a good deal.andM;One of the things that really sets this system apart is its proprietarystorage device -- the Starlet.andP;  It's a solid state data recorder thatcollects SMDR/CDR.andP;  Battery-backed CMOS RAM memory retains data for over amonth.andP;  It also has error correction stuff, ensuring transmission of all thatprecious SMDR data.andP;  If any block or data contains errors due to telephonenoise, the Starlet automatically retransmits the block until everything iskosher.andM;Moving right along, the Starlet has a real-time clock to boot.andP;  This means atime and date stamp is slapped on call records in the event the switchdoesn't already do that.andP;  Data compression in the unit also smashes therecords into a 2 to 1 ratio, without screwing up the call records' integrity.andM;It's new.andP;  Overall, looks promising.andM;CintechandM;It's been an exciting year at Cintech.andP;  They've already come out with acouple of new versions for both their PC and DEC VAX systems, entered thegovernment market and are working feverishly on a UNIX package and reportwriter option for all their products.andM;Let's take a peep at the new PC Version 3.00.andM;One new feature is the Carrier Cost Comparison Option, which enables the userto compare the long distance rates of their carrier to other long distancecarriers.andP;  This option is a result of inherent Vandamp;H rate tables which havealso been added to the new version.andM;The ability to report on individual trunks, instead of trunk groups, is alsoan improvement.andP;  Trunk reports now spot when a particular phone line (trunk)is out of service and exactly what type of communication flow this line isexperienceing.andP;  Obviously, this gig saves mucho dineros.andM;The VAX version has also been upgraded considerably.andP;  If you don't believeus, call Cintech.andP;  They'd love to tell you all about.andP;  They're nice people.andO;They're excited.andM;Com DevandM;Com Dev came out with release 1.3 of their Callquest III call-accountingsystem.andP;  As one might expect from this oft times innovative company, theproduct has been considerably enhanced.andP;  Some of those enhancements includetelephone directory, equipment charge and advanced authorization codesupport.andM;More specifically...andM;Directory -- This package offers extended information about each station suchas owner's title, location, status and multiple names.andP;  It includes fourreport variations based on station number or department number.andP;  Options areprovided to mask-out individual stations on the station or departmentdirectory reports.andP;  Station, accounting group and location information filescan be transported to other PCs and provide on-line directory look-up andstatus functions.andM;Equipment Charge -- Each station may be assigned a fixed equipment chargewhich is added to report totals on demand.andP;  Four reports offer selectivity toinclude the equipment charge on report totals.andP;  Several new reports andutilities were added to support this feature.andM;Authorization Code -- Authorization code support has been improved byrelating each authorization code to the owner's station number.andP;  The systemnow has the option, on calls that contain authorization code digits, tosubstitute the owner's station number based on the authorization code used.andO;The net result is you can make code reports by accounting groups.andM;There's more.andP;  We've whetted your appetite.andP;  But, as you know by now, we arenothing if not the traditional tease.andP;  Com Dev will fill you in on theintricacies of the upgrade.andM;CompucomandM;Because Compucom is a service bureau, they can minimize your investment inregard to capital equipment, computer, software, staff and, most important,the royal pains in the proverbial necks of dealing with your own system.andO;(Service bureau vs.andP;  CPE is a battle, by no means, decided.andP;  Both optionshave their strengths and weaknesses.)andM;Though Compucom can provide a business with all their telemanagement needs,we'll breeze through their basic call accounting offering.andP;  System highlightsinclude --andM;* Cost allocation: providing detailed listing of usage by station; allocationof total costs by department or cost center; reports of call and expensesassociated with project codes; isolates users exceeding preset duration orcost ceilings; and identifies frequently called numbers.andM;* Call rating: has international and domestic call ratings; bases it on Vandamp;Hcoordinates for flexibility; provides comprehensive data collectioncapabilities; and details local and miscellaneous charge recordings.andM;* Advanced Customer Information System (ACIS): allows interactive databaseinquiries; streamlined database initialization for ease of use; enhancedinventory and recurring charge program; and gives you a daily database updateto the mainframe.andM;* Traffic analysis; gives you a facility usage report for trunk evaluation;traffic reports based on area code, LATAs, cities, etc.; special requestreports if you need them; and an optional network design and optimizationservice.andM;Complementary SolutionsandM;This fine Atlanta, GA, company has come out with a new software product thatgives remote polling capabilities to their PC-based call-accounting product-- TeleMate.andM;The add-on, called TeleMate-global, allows users at a central location toautomatically collect call data from their remote sites at predeterminedschedules.andP;  There's a lot to mention here, but three characteristics of theupgrade standout.andM;* It's PC-based.andP;  In the past, call accounting for multiple remote sites wasbetter handled by mainframe and minicomputers because PCs and PC-basedsoftware couldn't effecively store and process the large volumes of callrecords involved.andM;The advent of 80386 processors and their product, which must require minimalmemory, have, so it seems, brought call accounting multi-site applicationsinto a new arena.andP;  They boast unlimited call capacity.andM;* Operations are automatic.andP;  Polling and processing of remote call recordsare automatic and with an optional feature, reporting may also be generatedautomatically.andP;  So these functions can be handled without a lot of operatormuss during nonbusiness hours and personnel at remote sites don't have to beinvolved in the polling process.andM;* Its price.andP;  Prices for polling packages can run quite high.andP;  They say theTeleMate deal can be all yours for about three grand, plus an additional$1,600 for each remote site (that includes all hardware and software).andM;That is a pretty amazing price tag.andM;DatatelandM;Here's a brand-new system for you to mull over.andP;  It's being offered byDatatel, a supply house.andP;  They built it along with a small software companyafter getting a lot of requests from their dealers.andM;PC-based and called the Data-Logger, the system can handle 32, 128 or 256station systems.andP;  It was built with the end user in mind.andP;  The interconnectdoesn't have to do anything but deliver the software to the intended, except,perhaps, run a wire from the KSU to the PC.andM;Easy to use, the end user builds his or her own rate tables and generates hisor her own series of specialized reports, including annual summaries.andP;  Thesystem is compatible with any standard SMDR output, and can be configured forspecial data strings if required.andP;  Best of all, the interconnect, accordingto Datatel, doesn't have to get involved with installation.andP;  You sell it andthen refer questions back to Datatel.andP;  Hmmmmm...andM;The price is a real kicker.andP;  The programs start at $159 dealer price and goup to $225 for the 256 station size.andP;  This sounds interesting.andM;DP CommunicationsandM;DP Communications was founded in 1975 as a consulting group.andP;  They builtsomething call TAMS after people kept asking for an intense telemanagementpackage.andM;TAMS is a relational database tool that designs cable configurations whilesimultaneously maintaining records of all cable and wiring pathway and systemcomponents.andP;  With it, users can trace circuits, pinpoint equipment problemsand create trouble tickets.andP;  It makes a nice recovery tool.andP;  A nice recoverytool.andM;TAMS (it stands for Telecom Asset Management System) is divided into modules.andO;There's inventory, which records and organizes data about all terminaldevices and cables.andP;  There's connectivity, which records and organizescomponent connections for circuit tracing.andP;  There's cable installation, whichproduces work orders, pulls schedules and labels cable.andP;  There's maintenance,which supports trouble management and moves, adds and changes.andP;  And, finally,there's a CAD interface, providing a link between the database and digitizedbuilding drawings.andM;E-CommsandM;E-Comms has been making their non-pollable Call Accounting Buffers (CABs) fora while now.andP;  New for them, a true advance, is their Pollable Call AccountingBuffers -- PollCabs.andM;The units respond to the popular WTI (Western Telematic) commands.andP;  And allunits (there are several to choose from, including an ACD version) areavailable with or without Hayes compatible 300, 1200 and 2400 baud modems.andM;They feature a call-back function which allows the buffer to call the pollingcomputer when it reaches 80% full or immediately upon disconnect.andP;  There'salso an option of sending data in the compressed mode, reducing transmissiontime by a factor as much as six.andP;  Furthermore, optional date/time stampingfor PBX systems that can't hack it is provided and the ability to transmitthe stored call records in their raw ASCII format or with the XModem protocolinsures data integrity over the phone line without expensive CRC modems.andM;Fully automatic, front panel LEDs keep you informed as to system status.andP;  Anaudible alarm alerts the operator when the machine is closing in on beingstuffed.andP;  And static CMOS memory and lithium batteries are used to provide asafe environment for that always precious SMDR data.andM;Estech SystemsandM;Estech's PhoneBill is a standalone call accounting system for the specialneeds of motel owners.andP;  The small, metal-encased unit can be kept right onthe front desk of the motel.andM;It stores up to 2,600 records and prints reports and records on any standardserial printer.andP;  Day-to-day operation is very simple.andP;  Instructions for mostfunctions are printed right on the faceplate.andM;The user can program up to 42 bands for rating calls.andP;  These bands can beupdated or changed at any time.andP;  Programming is done using the four-by-fourkeypad on the face of the unit.andP;  This keypad also lets the user generateguest check-out slips and reports.andM;Reports include Guest Summary for totals for all guests, Room Audit fortotals of departed guests and Band Summary for totals by band and a grandtotal since last printed.andM;Gemini TelemanagementandM;SystemsandM;The Ringback Detection Unit (RDU) by Gemini tackles common, revenueaffecting, problems faced by hoteliers.andP;  Simply attach the RDU to yourtelephone lines.andP;  It monitors the ringing when the line is used anddetermines whether or not the call is answered.andP;  If it is, the unit reportsto the call-accounting system and the call is priced accordingly.andP;  If thecall doesn't go through, then the call accounting system is not notified.andM;This both eliminates the problems of guests being charged for calls that werenot completed (hence cutting down the instances of conversations at the checkout counter, &quot;$150 for a call I didn't make?andP;  Hang the bill, I'll see you incourt you crook!!&quot;) and also stops guests from making short duration callswithout being charged.andP;  So I guess we'll have less of a reason to complainabout hotel bills...aw, shucks.andM;John TelecomandM;Gimlet was developed by JTI for a client with large monthly call volumes(200,000) who was exasperated by the slow speed of many call-accountingprograms.andP;  By all accounts, it looks like JTI came up with a real winner.andO;Fast and furious in action, Gimlet is PC-based, allowing the program-usertotal parameter control while meeting the format requirements of anytelephone system capable of generating Serial SMDR.andM;Gimlet's default and number tables are program resident and easy tomanipulate, which makes it ideal for users with simple or varying reportrequirements.andP;  The program's high speed and parameter flexibility make lightwork of any call accounting job, be it teeny or massive.andM;Multi-level reporting, customer defined record formats and rate tables,multi-target tracking and call costing are just some of the features of theJTI Gimlet.andP;  Real-time displays show you the volumes and associated costs ofcalls during daily, weekly or monthly periods.andP;  You can store all records todisk if so desired and the program can be configured to a variety of systems,making it possible to poll a network of systems simultaneously.andM;Infortext SystemsandM;Infortext is one of the big-time players in the call accounting business andstocks a big-time series of products in the OS System.andP;  These consist of theOS Standard, which is in fact three separate models for different purposesand the enhanced OS Plus.andP;  All have the same basic operating structure aswell as the same high standards of productivity.andP;  They will satisfy the needsof firms with up to 350 trunks, 4,000 stations and 500,000 call records.andM;The entire series runs on IBM AT compatibles, PS/2 machines and approved 386models.andP;  The program is basically menu driven, allowing people with little PCexperience to use the full capabilities of the system, while makingapplications easy to use.andP;  The system runs on a front-end processor (FEP)that frees the host PC for other applications whilst it is still processingand storing call data.andP;  Reports can be displayed or printed instantly as aresult of the processing and pre-sorting of calls as they are received.andM;The OS Standard series consists of the general model, the package for hotelsand motels and the professional services package.andP;  The hotel/motel modeloffers flexible billing, allowing you to charge different rates foradministrative and guest calls.andP;  Desk clerks can generate billing informationat guest checkout with only a few keystrokes.andP;  Detailed and summary reportsof telephone activity are easily produced by extension and room number.andM;The professional services package is similar to the motel one, but allows youto designate specific client codes and individual rates for chargebackpurposes.andP;  Exception reports identify calls made without these codes.andM;All of the models have a fully relational database, where changes made in onesection are automatically recorded in related files, and PBX imaging, whicheliminates the need for a manual inventory of telecom equipment prior toinstallation.andM;The OS Plus has sone really neat features and is still more flexible.andP;  Thetraffix PBX optimization service analyses trunk service levels, henceenabling you to optimally configure trunk groups resulting in big savings.andO;You can evaluate operator performance through the number of abandoned calls,response time and queue time for incoming calls.andM;It now also has time-of-day ranges, so the user can prepare work shiftstudies and list calls during specific times of the day.andP;  The OS Plus canalso produce reports of frequently dialed numbers and number search reports,allowing users to identify unusual calling patterns and abuse.andP;  It also has atiered security system that limits access to specified operators.andM;The new features of the OS Plus include the ability to monitor calls as theyoccur on a particular trunk group, a graph production feature for specificfeatures or all calls and an ASCII export capability that offers additionalflexibility in defining formats of files and a larger choice of data.andP;  Ifyou're serious about call accounting, so is Infortext.andM;MBGandM;MBG is a call accounting service bureau that recently came up with a fairlyunique application for one if its customers.andP;  This company was lucky enoughto be one of ATandamp;T's first Tariff 12 customers.andP;  And while they had thepotential to save a lot of money, Tariff 12 also made it a little moredifficult to keep track of things.andM;MBG developed a program that verifies the VTNS (Virtual TelecommunicationsNetwork Service) tapes supplied by ATandamp;T.andP;  The program provides the customerwith all kinds of valuable reports including a console audit of the network,Site Billing Summary, Site Audit Report with On-net and Off-net callingbreakdowns, Audit of Calls Redirected, Billing Audit by Rate Schedule,Billing Audit by Category and Intrastate Summary.andM;MoscomandM;Moscom manufactures M3000 software -- the software that imposes no limits onthe number of call records you can store.andP;  The only thing you have to worryabout is the disk capacity of your PC.andP;  This software also has MajorMetropolitan Area costing which lets intended ones choose from 11-majorcalling areas to set up the system's call costing.andP;  (But customized tarifftables are still available, of course).andM;The M3000 software, which is available in 3-1/2&quot; and 5-1/4&quot; diskettes, alsohas Dialed Digit Processing to handle special numbers like directoryinformation, 800 and O+ calls.andM;Moscom is a company on the up and up.andP;  We fell just hoopy that they're doingso well.andP;  We're even more hoopy about the success of their M3000 callaccounting software systems overseas.andP;  They've just started to sell them toNorway and that follows distribution agreements for other Moscom productswith Siemens in West Germany, Alcatel in France and British Telecom as well.andO;This comes on top of the success the product has had back here.andM;Speaking of the home front, Moscom is also the designer and manufacturer ofthe CDRU/S (call detail recording unit/small) ATandamp;T has been selling and usingsince last December.andP;  The CDRU/S collects, stores and transmits telephonecall detail records within an environment of ATandamp;T polling devices, networkcontrol computers and PBXs made by both ATandamp;T and other manufacturers.andO;Specifically, it is for the small and medium sized facility end of themarket.andM;NEC Information SystemsandM;NEC offers two telemanagement software packages.andP;  Super-Phacs, which runs onUNIX operating system environments, and Astra-Phacs Plus.andP;  Both run on theAstra family of multi-user systems which are made by, surprise surprise, NEC.andM;Super-Phacs offers the various features, including traffic managementcapabilities to analyse trunk usage (surpluses, shortages and malfunctions),cost analysis (including the ability to perform hypothetical situations),on-line system-interactive query capabilities and tie-line reconciliation andpolling options that allow users to manage multiple sites.andM;The system also provides customized capabilities for the option of tailoringthe system to specific needs.andP;  The call management reporting module providesa variety of call and summary reports.andP;  Graphic and numeric representationsof trunk usage during specified times, cost summaries, incoming callsummaries and other reports are also available.andM;The Astra-Phacs Plus has remote polling, station message detail recording andtraffic management and it now offers call record sorting and storagecapabilities as well as graphical data interpretation and an enhanced messagecenter.andM;NEC also offers the PILAR Astra-Phacs, a voice-directed, PC-based interactivelearning.andM;Northern TelecomandM;The Meridian Manager by Northern Telecom helps communications professionalsmanage their Meridian SL-1 systems more efficiently.andP;  It does this throughinnovative color graphics and a user-friendly, menu-driven format.andM;The Manager is a portfolio of personal computer applications that allowsusers to manage more effectively.andP;  All applications use plain language,simple key procedures and use coor graphics.andP;  They all run in an MS-DOSenvironment.andP;  They include the Station Administrator, which allows a systemadministrator to manipulate the system to necessary requirements.andP;  It makesit easy to add, change or delete features on individual telephone sets, aswell as create new stations.andM;The Work Order System enables the planning, control and management of adds,moves and changes.andP;  This application uses a relational database, soinformation need only be put in once.andP;  It also generates a monthly profit andloss statement for the communications department as well as bills for everydepartment served.andM;If you have a Meridian system, then it could be worth your while to look intothese applications.andM;OmnitronixandM;Omnitronix recently introduced CallSafe, a buffer for low end, on-sitecall-accounting applications.andP;  CallSafe uses static RAM memory and isavailable with 32K, 64K, 128K and 256K memory.andP;  This memory capacity isfurther boosted with 4:1 data compression.andP;  A 256K unit holds about onemegabyte of call record info.andM;The CallSafe's inernal lithium battery lets you hang on to your data for 12months or longer.andP;  Twelve LEDs on the front panel keep you up to date oneverything you need to know: percentage full, transmit and receive data,handshaking, power and so on.andP;  An audible alarm lets you know when the unit'smemory is near full.andM;Omnitronix made some upgrades on the PBXpress call record buffer also.andP;  ThisCDR storage and pollinc device sports an 80188 microprocessor, internalbattery backup, LED percent-full indicators, a pair of RS-232 serial ports,an internal modem options, a real-time clock option and an EEROMconfiguration option.andM;Its memory capacity ranges from 64K to 4 Meg.andP;  Like the CallSafe, it provides4:1 data compression.andP;  You can configure the unit with over 100 commands.andO;Interesting features include the Format feature, which lets you reconfigurerecords and strip unneeded data.andP;  Among the data transfer methods it supportsis the ever-popular Xmodem format.andP;  It's obviously a buffer with manyappealing features.andM;Orbi-TelandM;The Orbi-Tel mini- or microcomputer based system allows telecom managers tocontrol costs while providing high quality user service.andP;  The system consistsof nine fully integrated modules.andP;  The most notable of these include advancedcall accounting, which allows customers to design and produce reports totheir specific requirements.andM;The most recent addition to the system, Cable and Wire, allows you to managethe complete cable network that you have installed in an effective manner,providing optimal use of your network in single or multi-storey applications.andO;It can be used in multiple building situations as well.andM;Traffic analysis produces information showing when and where your network iseither over, or under, utilized.andP;  The directory services program is kind ofneat in that it can access employee information by name, department,extension and position as well.andP;  All in all, this is another system that willdo the job.andM;One PlusandM;One Plus has been around for a while.andP;  They've improved a really nice productwith the opening of their new applications department.andP;  For those not contentwith the standard One Plus PC software package, which can do most everythingfrom departmental call summaries to unattended report generation to operatoractivity graphs and WATS coverage effectiveness (among other things), thisnew department is for you.andM;The idea is you decide just what you want your program to do and how itshould work, then call the folks out there in Colorado and they'll do thebest job they can to customize your One Plus call accounting system to yourown specifications and unique applications requirements.andP;  Isn't that nice ofthem?andM;ProtelandM;Protel?andP;  We know what you are thinking -- &quot;What does a payphone manufacturerhave to do with call accounting and telecom management?&quot;andP;  Well, payphoneshave to be managed too, and Protel developed Express Net payphone managementsoftware toward that end.andM;Express Net is compatible with any IBM or compatible PC with 640K RAM and a10 Meg hard drive.andP;  It handles even big operations -- it keeps track of up to1,000 coin telephone units.andP;  It reports each phone's daily activity andrevenues as well as tracking such flags as stuck coins and inactivity toalert you to problems.andM;Express Net provides information that is unique to managing payphones.andP;  Itgives you a daily snapshot of coin revenue, the actual money in the coin boxand a record of past collections.andP;  It provides an audit trail of OperatorService Providers and lets you evaluate each location's performance.andP;  Thereports give you proof of call activity to verify billings and claims.andM;Soft-ComandM;Soft-Com's Commander Version 2 adds a whole bunch of features to the originalversion of their Commander Telemanagement System.andP;  The big news is theaddition of a Polling module which lets larger companies with more than onelocation use Commander to control call data from a central location.andM;The new module can poll 99 remote locations at specified intervals.andP;  Thelocations can be polled several times a day or only once a month.andP;  When thesite is polled, Commander Call Accounting jumps in and processes the calldata with its own database and rate files at the central site.andM;The Polling module also adds Multi-Site Direct Input and Polling of RemoteStorage Devices.andP;  Other new features include Scheduled and Automatic Reports,Called Number Identification, Multiple Carrier Call Pricing and the additionof a Monthly Equipment Charge Field to the Extension Reports.andM;Right now the Commander can poll Western Telematic Pollcats.andP;  Soft-Comexpects to add the capability to poll PCs equipped with their CDR program andother PCs running their Scout or Commander programs in the near future.andM;StrykerandM;Stryker has a number of new tricks up its sleeve.andP;
