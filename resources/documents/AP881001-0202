This is takeover fever, and rather than diminishing as forecastit seems to be intensifying. Involved in the action are corporateraiders, corporations seeking new assets, leveraged buyout fundsand big financial institutions.   The reheating of leveraged buyout fever was measured again lastweek when Manufacturers Hanover Corp., once a staid old bankingoperation, announced formation of a buyout fund that could amountto as much as $2 billion.   Large as that figure is, it belies the true buying power. Whenused to buy out shareholders of a target company, it can beleveraged at a ratio of from 5-to-1 to even 10-to-1, or $10 billionto $20 billion.   Such an amount is sufficient to frighten the management of allbut the biggest companies in the United States, but it is only asmall part of the pot. An estimated $25 billion to $30 billion iscontrolled by buyout specialists.   The activity itself _ and the potential for more _ is generatingconcern not just from business and investment people, but fromother interested parties who fear that the long-term soundness ofthe economy is endangered.   High on the list of concerns is that sound companies, slowlybuilt over many decades, are falling into the hands of manipulatorsrather than managers, and are prone not only to immediatedissection but also to eventual destruction.   Enhancing the power _ and perhaps the danger _ of leveragedbuyout money are ``junk bonds,'' which are high-risk debtsecurities paying high rates of interest. A major role of suchbonds is to substitute long-term debt for equity.   Debt does wonderful things for those seeking to buy existingcompanies, but it is generally thought to be more dangerous thanequity to deal with. And, the critics say, those dangers may beworsened by other activities of the buyers.   One of these activities is to think short term _ to sacrificedistant strength for immediate financial results _ and that, saycritics, can get any company into trouble. Such buyers also seek tolessen debt by selling off parts of the company, perhaps weakeningit in the process.   The debt itself can become the biggest problem of all,especially in a downturn. Costly to begin with, it can becomedestructively so in a recession or period of high interest rates,when even strong companies may teeter.   There is another, more positive, view of the scene: Leveragedbuyouts sometimes get rid of poor management, and they provide apremium over market prices for shareholders of the company takenover.   During 1986, for example, 31 percent of all deals were completedat a 50 percent or better premium. In 1987, 38 percent of all dealswere at prices at least 50 percent higher than those that prevaileda month earlier.   Such short-term benefits cannot be denied. The question onlytime can answer is whether these immediate benefits provoke distantproblems.   ``The transformation of billions of dollars of equuity into debtis eroding the financial footing of U.S. industry,'' says WrightInvestors' Service. It worries about the economic consequences in adownturn.   Concern also is expressed by many critics about the marketvolatility and instability that have increased as a result oftakeover fever, with some stocks rising or falling 10 percent in aday on takeover speculation.   It was, Wright says, one of the underlying causes of the stockmarket collapse of last October, and it also seems to be high onthe list of reasons why many individual investors have abandonedthe market, perhaps for good.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Mon Oct. 3</NOTE></DOC>
