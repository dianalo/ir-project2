What's the format of each one: 78 RPMrecord, open-reel tape, compact disk?andP;  Where is it stored?&quot;andP;  You can even setup separate databases for classics and jazz.andM;The package's simplicity is also its weakness.andP;  A fixed-length 40-characterfield is needlessly long for the conductor's name but could be too short forthe music's full title.andP;  With the selection and album number entered, the&quot;album title&quot; field is seldom useful.andM;Although the program gives you an &quot;other&quot; field--and lets you attach a fewlines of &quot;notes&quot; to all instances of a given entry--it will frustrate theconscientious cataloger who wants his database to contain fuller informationthat is found on a record's front cover.andM;To be thorough, we need fields for additional composers (up to five for oneballet), arranger or editor, composition date, recording date, pages included(for &quot;exerpts&quot; albums), measures excluded, section timings, and criticalcomments.andP;  Below the title of a lieder cycle, add fields to identify thesong, text author, key, and language used.andP;  And for opera, add a list ofsingers, linked with their voice types and roles.andM;Beware of inconsistent input: the software will never recognize that &quot;RoyalPhilharmonic,&quot; &quot;The Royal Philharmonic,&quot; and &quot;RPO&quot; are the same orchestra.andO;Better maintain a paper style sheet, listing all your spellings andconventions.andP;  (Why isn't there a &quot;crib sheet&quot; file the program could access?)andM;Micro Music Manager is an attractive package, with a 60-day money-backguarantee.andP;  But this version won't accept the questions I want to ask: Findme the 1917 version of Verklarte Nacht.andP;  List all records where the composeris also the conductor.andP;  Then print out all Italian-language pre-1950 excerptsfrom Carmen--in correct sequence as heard in the score.andM;If you don't need that level of detail and you simply want a computer indexof your Mozart and Mahler, Micro Music Manager is the next best thing to aprivate librarian.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
