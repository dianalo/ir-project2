The commentperiod for the proposal closed on March 15, 1989.Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the commentsreceived.Since issuance of the NPRM the manufacturer issued Revision 5, dated June1, 1989, to Boeing Service Bulletin 727-53-72. This revision clarifieslow frequency eddy current (LFEC) and high frequency eddy current (HFEC)procedures, defines skin thickness location, and revises and clarifiesthe lap joint modification. The final rule has been revised to referenceRevision 5 as the appropriate service document. This change does not increasethe burden on any operator, revise the aircraft affected by this, or expandthe scope of the rule.As a result of extensive investigation following an accident in Hawaiiin April 1988, which involved a Model 737 series airplane, the FAA hasdetermined that widespread, multi-site cracking was not being discoveredto the degree of assurance necessary to maintain safety of the aging transportairplane fleet. This, coupled with a better understanding of the humanfactors associated with numerous repetitive inspections, has caused theFAA to place less emphasis on repetitive inspections and more emphasison restoration of structure. Thus, as aircraft begin to show the signsof multi-site damage and other indications of structural aging, the FAAhas decided, whenever practicable, to require airplane modifications necessaryto remove the source of the particular aging phenomenon. This is in lieuof the previous position of continual inspection and repair/modificationon condition if cracks are found. This final rule is in consonance withthat policy decision.One commenter requested that the HFEC inspection threshold be increasedfrom 28,000 landings to 35,000 landings. The commenter stated that, sincethere have been few lap joint cracks on airplanes with less than 35,000landings, this was justification for the increase of the threshold to 35,000landings for the HFEC inspection. The FAA disagrees. The FAA has receivedreports of cases of fatigue cracks on airplanes with less than 35,000 landings;therefore, the proposed threshold is appropriate.Another commenter requested that the reference to the external visual inspectionfor delamination be deleted and that repair of delamination prior to furtherflight not be required. Further, the commenter suggested that delaminationshould be reinspected like minor corrosion. This comment was based uponthe inability to accurately detect delamination in the lap joints of theModel 727 airplane. The disbond of the lap joint does not, by itself, resultin an unsafe condition, but leads to fatigue cracking and/or corrosion.The FAA has determined that when delamination has been detected, an acceptablelevel of safety can be maintained either by repairing the delaminationimmediately, as proposed, or by monitoring for future cracking or corrosion.Therefore, the FAA concurs with the commenter and the final rule has beenrevised to incorporate these comments.Another commenter suggested that paint removal should be required onlyif the fastener head is not clearly visible, and that the requirement toremove the paint, if the paint is more than two layers thick, should bedeleted. The FAA concurs with this comment and has deleted the referenceto the number of coats of paint.Another commenter suggested that the HFEC inspection be performed priorto oversizing holes and not after the fasteners have been installed. TheFAA concurs with this comment and it has been incorporated into the finalrule.Another commenter suggested that the replacement of blind fasteners withsolid protruding head fasteners within 3,000 landings should be changedto ``whenever the solid countersink head fasteners are changed to solidprotruding head fasteners.'' The commenter stated that fleet experiencehas not indicated that blind fasteners inspected at 2,500 landing intervalswill be a problem. The commenter also stated that test data shows the NAS1398 blind fastener installation has a life improvement of greater than15,000 landings. The commenter submitted data that substantiated the factthat certain blind fasteners had a life-limit of 10,000 landings. The FAAconcurs with the commenter's suggestion. The final rule has been changedto allow a life-limit of 10,000 landings for certain blind fasteners.Another commenter suggested that a specific statement for an alternatemeans of compliance should be added to the AD for those operators who haveincorporated the protruding head fastener installation in accordance withBoeing Service Bulletin 727-53-72, with no HFEC inspection of the hole.Furthermore, this commenter stated this alternate means of compliance shouldbe satisfied by requiring a detailed external visual inspection in accordancewith paragraph B. of the NPRM. The FAA concurs that requirements shouldbe specified concerning holes that have not been eddy current inspectedprior to fastener installation. The final rule has been revised to addprovisions for airplanes that had protruding head rivets previously installed,without having had the rivets holes HFEC inspected prior to fastener installation;those airplanes remain subject to repetitive close visual inspections inaccordance with paragraph B.1. of the final rule.Another commenter stated that the rule should require a detailed internalvisual inspection of the tear straps at 4-year/12,000-hour intervals, similarto the requirements of AD 88-22-11, Amendment 39-6059 (53 FR 44156; November1, 1988), for the Boeing Model 737. Furthermore, the commenter believesthat the Model 727 airplane did not have the phosphoric acid pre-treatmentfor bonding. The bonded tearstraps on the Model 727 airplanes are currentlyrequired to be ultrasonically inspected in accordance with AD 81-17-07,Amendment 39-4194. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request.There has not been any service history to warrant this inspection on theModel 727 airplanes that did not have the phosphoric acid pre-treatmentprior to bonding. Additionally, the FAA is assessing the need to mandateinternal inspections and may consider further rulemaking action on thissubject.One commenter suggested that a detailed internal visual inspection of thelap joint be required at 4-year/12,000-hour intervals. The commenter statedthat if cracks occur in the lower rivet row in the hidden inner sheet,they will not turn and allow a safe decompression because the outer sheetprovides support against local bulging. Recent adverse service experienceinvolving cracking along the hidden inner skin at certain locations hasprompted the FAA to address this area in a separate rulemaking action.Another commenter requested that consideration be given to requiring replacementof the lower row of rivets. The FAA is assessing the fatigue life of thereworked lap joints and may consider further rulemaking action based uponthis assessment.Another commenter suggested that a skin replacement program should be implementedif the inspection program is inadequate. The FAA does not concur that askin replacement program is warranted. The FAA has determined that thecurrent program of requiring reworking lap splices S-4 and S-10, in additionto frequent inspections for corrosion and cracks at the other lap splices,will assure continued airworthiness of the affected Model 727 series airplanes.Several commenters requested that the proposed initial HFEC inspectionat 1 year or 2,500 landings, be increased to 18 months or 3,000 landings.The rationale for the increased time before the initial inspection is topermit accomplishment during a scheduled ``C'' check. This would reducescheduling problems. The FAA does not concur with an increase in the timeprior to the HFEC inspection. The FAA has determined that the HFEC inspectionsshould be conducted as soon as possible in order to detect cracking ina timely manner, and has received no data to justify an initial inspectionlater than that proposed in the NPRM.Another commenter suggested that the HFEC inspection for cracks requiredby proposed paragraph A. be required only in areas where the skin is lessthan .056 inch thick, and that the service bulletin should be revised toidentify locations of .056 inch or greater skin thickness, which are notsubject to the fatigue problem associated with the knife edge conditionat countersunk fasteners. The manufacturer has revised Service Bulletin727-53-72 to identify areas of .056 inch and greater skin thickness. TheFAA concurs with this comment. The final rule has been changed to requireinspection for cracks of the lap splices with skin thicknesses less than.056 inch, and inspections for corrosion and delamination on all lap splices.Another commenter requested that the initial visual inspection be requiredwithin 1 year or 2,500 landings, instead of the proposed 6 months. Sinceno justification was given for such an extension, the FAA does not agreewith this comment.Another commenter stated that the proposed rule requires both HFEC andLFEC inspections if corrosion is found. The commenter requested that thisbe clarified. The HFEC procedures are used to detect cracks and LFEC proceduresare used to determine amount of material loss in areas of corrosion. TheFAA considers the rule to be clear in this regard, and finds no discrepancyin the wording of the requirements relating to HFEC and LFEC inspections.Several comments were received concerning the discussion that future rulemakingmay require additional rework of the lap splices. Commenters proposed thatthe requirement for replacement of the upper row of countersunk rivetswith oversize protruding head rivets should be delayed until the additionalrework has been defined. At this time the FAA has no definite planned futureaction concerning replacement of the lower rows of countersunk rivets,and it is, therefore, considered inappropriate to delay the rework of theS-4 and S-10 lap joints.Another commenter requested that the compliance time for rework of theS-4 and S-10 lap joints be staggered to require incorporation of the reworksooner on high-time airplanes, but allow more time on lower-time airplanes.The FAA concurs with this comment; however, reducing the compliance timefor the high-time airplanes to less than that proposed in the NPRM wouldrequire additional rulemaking and could not be accomplished without furtheropportunity for public comment. The FAA has determined that the 4-yearcompliance time proposed in the NPRM for high-time airplanes provides anadequate level of safety. The compliance time for airplanes with less than45,000 cycles as of the effective date of this AD has been increased to6 years based on the lower incidence of cracking.Another commenter suggested that the lap splices behind the wing-to-bodyfairings should not have to be inspected until the airplane has accumulated3,000 landings or 18 months after the effective date, whichever occursfirst. The justification for this suggestion is that the fasteners underthe fairings are protruding head rivets and the skin is not countersunk,which eliminates the fatigue problem. Also, the area under the fairinghas not experienced corrosion problems. The FAA concurs in part with thiscomment, and has revised the final rule to permit additional time betweenvisual inspections for the lap jonts with protruding head fasteners underthe fairings. The initial inspection has not been changed, however, Comments were received concerning the use of a sliding probe instead ofa pencil probe for the HFEC inspection. The commenters stated that thesliding probe is faster, thus reducing operator fatigue and permittingmore reliable inspection results. Further, Boeing has revised Service Bulletin727-53-72 and the inspection manual to describe use of the sliding probe.The FAA concurs that the use of the sliding probe is faster than the pencilprobe. The final rule, by referencing the latest revision to the applicableBoeing service bulletin, permits use of the sliding probe.Another commenter stated that requiring the LFEC inspection of the entirepanel length, if visible corrosion is detected, will result in detectingvery minor corrosion or false indications that will require correctiveaction. Furthermore, the commenter stated that its policy of opening upthe joint until no more visible corrosion is detected and repairing thevisible corrosion has proven to be an effective method for controllingcorrosion.The FAA agrees that the commenter's procedure may be effective in dealingwith corrosion in the lap joints. However, the FAA finds that if the corrosionis not repaired immediately, it is necessary to determine severity andextent of corrosion and, if necessary, repair prior to further flight.Therefore, the proposed requirements, in this regard, are appropriate.Another commenter requested the rule be revised so that if corrosion isdetected and found not to exceed 10% of the skin thickness, it could bevisually inspected at 1 year intervals. The FAA does not concur and hasdetermined that this procedure would not provide adequate monitoring ofpreviously detected corrosion.One commenter requested that a terminating modification be available toeliminate the requirement of visual inspection for corrosion. The FAA concurswith this comment. The manufacturer has developed a modification to terminatethe visual inspections for corrosion, and has incorporated it into Revision5 of the applicable service bulletin. This modification consists of openingthe lap splices, cleaning up any corrosion, and applying fay surface sealant,then installing appropriate fasteners. The final rule has been revisedto specify this modification as terminating action for the inspectionscontained in the final rule for the area modified.One commenter stated that Boeing Service Bulletin 727-53-72, Revision 4,did not specify the amount of hole oversizing permitted to remove cracks.Further, another commenter stated that the service bulletin does not containinstructions for repairing a delaminated joint. The FAA notes that Revision5 to the service bulletin, which is now reflected in the final rule, specifiesthe oversizing limits and contains instructions for repair of the delaminatedjoints.One commenter suggested that the detailed visual inspection proposed inthe NPRM should be based upon landings instead of calendar time, sincethe fatigue cracking is related to pressurization cycles. The FAA doesnot concur. The close visual inspection is intended to detect corrosion,which is time-related, and/or fatigue cracking, which is cycle-related;therefore, the inspection was based upon the more restrictive of the twotimes, which is the calendar time.One commenter suggested that if an eddy current inspection has been accomplishedwithin the last 2 years, it should not be necessary to accomplish the closevisual within the next 6 months. The FAA does not concur. The visual inspectionis for the detection of corrosion and/or cracking. Therefore, the FAA findsthat the commenter's recommended interval of greater than 2\1/2\ yearsfor visual inspection allows too much time for corrosion to grow. The ruledoes give credit, however, for visual inspections that were conducted withinthe last 9 months.One commenter asked if the area of the HFEC inspection could be reduced,based upon service history. The commenter noted that the fatigue crackingassociated with the lap joints has been predominately at S-4 and S-10,where the skin thickness is less than .056 inch. The FAA concurs with thiscomment. The final rule has been revised to require the eddy current inspectionbe conducted at S-4 and S-10 only, unless corrosion or cracking is detected.Two comments were received regarding the replacement of all upper row fastenersin a panel which contains blind fasteners. The commenters felt that theyshould be required to replace only the blind fasteners. The FAA concursthat only the blind fasteners need to be replaced, except in those areaswhere replacement is required under paragraph E. The final rule incorporatesthis change.Another commenter stated that the S-14 lap joint is composed of heavy skinswhich are not bonded on certain Model 727 airplanes and, therefore, shouldnot be referenced in paragraph B. of the NPRM. The FAA concurs with thiscomment and the final rule has been revised accordingly. Recent serviceproblems at certain locations along the S-14 lap joint are the subjectof a separate rulemaking action.One commenter stated that Boeing Service Bulletin 727-53-72, Revision 4,which was referenced in the NPRM, states that the repair in the servicebulletin may be used as a preventive modification and is optional to thosedetailed in the structural repair manual (SRM). Therefore, the commenteris uncertain whether the SRM repair is an acceptable preventive modification.The FAA has determined that the repairs in the SRM that deviate from theterminating action in the service bulletin are not considered to be anacceptable preventive modification. This note has been deleted from Revision5 of the service bulletin to clarify this point.One commenter stated that the HFEC inspection was not detailed as to whattype of eddy current inspection is required. The FAA notes that Revision5 of the applicable service bulletin clarifies this subject by definingwhich fastener holes are to be inspected and referencing three differentHFEC inspection procedures.Another commenter stated that there are no details on how to conduct theLFEC inspection for corrosion. Also, the commenter believed that the LFECinspection could be used to detect corrosion on both the outer and innerskins of the lap joint. Revision 5 to the applicable service bulletin,now reflected in the final rule, has incorporated procedures for accomplishingthe LFEC inspection. The LFEC inspection is used to detect corrosion onthe outer skin, but not on the inner skin.One commenter stated that future action concerning the cold bonded circumferentialbutt joint, doublers, and tearstrap should be combined into this rule,which affects the lap joints. The FAA does not concur with this comment.AD 81-17-07, Amendment 39-4194, was issued to require inspection of thecold bonded tearstraps. The FAA is considering additional rulemaking actionto address the cold bonded circumferential butt joint and doublers; however,the FAA has determined that this action regarding the lap splices is urgentand appropriate to address an identified unsafe condition.One commenter stated that certain panels that have a major interruption,such as a cargo door or entry door, should not have to be inspected alongits entire length when a small crack or corrosion is detected. The FAAconcurs that the panel ends at the cutout. The final rule has been revisedto clarify this.Another commenter stated that, according to the proposal, if an apparentcrack was detected visually, but an HFEC inspection determined that thereis no crack, it would be necessary to HFEC-inspect the entire panel. Thecommenter believes that, if the HFEC confirms there is no crack at thelocation of the visual indication, it should not be necessary to HFEC-inspectthe rest of the panel. The FAA concurs. It is obvious that additional HFECinspections are not required if the visual inspection is determined tobe erroneous. The AD has not been revised because of this comment.Another commenter stated that the proposed rule is unclear whether it isnecessary to conduct a HFEC inspection of the three rivet rows. The FAAnotes that the HFEC inspection is required for the upper rivet row only.(This is also clarified in Revision 5 to Boeing Service Bulletin 727-53-72.)After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the following rule, with the changes previously noted.These changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator,nor increase the scope of the AD.There are approximately 813 Model 727 series airplanes of the affecteddesign in the worldwide fleet. It is estimated that 623 airplanes of U.S.registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1,432manhours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that theaverage labor cost will be $40 per manhour. Based on these figures, thetotal cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $35,700,000.Information collection requirements contained in this regulation have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) and have been assignedOMB Control Number 2120-0056.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is nota ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positiveor negative, on a substantial number of small entities, under the criteriaof the Regulatory Felxibility Act. A final evaluation has been preparedfor this action and is contained in the regulatory docket.
