The tearful wife of the television evangelist spoke to reportersoutside her home here after Bakker was committed to a hospital forpsychiatric evaluation by U.S. District Judge Robert Potter, whosuspended his fraud trial in Charlotte, N.C.   ``We have been under emotional stress for 2{ years and we've beenholding steady for 2{ years and I just think that he couldn't holdsteady anymore, and I would like to tell the people you be in ourshoes and see if you could hold steady for 2{ years,'' Mrs. Bakkersaid.   A sobbing Bakker was led away in handcuffs and manacles Thursdayafter a psychiatrist reported that he had been hallucinating andcowering in a fetal position in his lawyer's office.   The same day, Mrs. Bakker prayed in a television broadcast of her``Jim and Tammy Show'' for the ``spirit of lying'' to be driven outof her husband's fraud trial, but she did not mention the incident.   ``Spirit of lying you are bound!'' Mrs. Bakker prayed on thebroadcast from an Orlando studio Thursday. ``Get out of thatcourtroom, get off God's people in the name of Jesus!''   Mrs. Bakker also issued a message to her husband that she andothers were in prayer for him.   ``I love you darling, hang in there, don't give up,'' Mrs. Bakkersaid. ``And that's all you have to do. You don't even have to do thepraying. Let us do the praying. Let the people who love you do thepraying.''   Asked by reporters later whether she thought in her ``worstfears'' her husband might suffer a mental breakdown, Mrs. Bakkerreplied, ``No, I didn't. But you know, a person's mental capacity, Isuppose, can only take so much.''   Mrs. Bakker said her husband was very distressed by the collapsein the courtroom Wednesday of former PTL executive Steve Nelson, aprosecution witness.   ``I knew when I talked to Jim last night that he was in aterrible emotional trauma and I prayed with him and we agreed thatwe would trust the Lord,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
