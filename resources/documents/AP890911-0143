The report, prepared by consultant Robert Gersony, described thedeath-toll estimate as conservative.   The victims were members of the Issak minority, a group accusedby the central government of aiding insurgents. The report said theIssaks weren't in rebellion and didn't pose an immediate threat tothe government.   The slayings, according to the report, began after attacks by therebel Somali National Movement on the towns of Burao and Hargeisa inMay 1988.   ``The Somali armed forces conducted what appears to be asystematic pattern of attacks against unarmed, civilian Issakvillages, watering points and grazing areas of northern Somalia,killing many of their residents and forcing the survivors to fleefor safety to remote areas,'' the report said.   ``Simulataneously, the Somali armed forces engaged in a patternof roundups, summary executions and massacres of many hundreds, ifnot more, unarmed civilian Issaks.''   Survivors fleeing toward sanctuary in Ethiopia were attacked bySomali air and ground forces, and hundreds were killed, the reportsaid. Many civilians imprisoned on allegations of supporting therebels were beaten and choked, it said.   Hundreds of thousands of Issak refugees reached Ethiopia in March.   The report also accused rebel forces of killing civilians andprisoners of war from late May to late August 1988.   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday that thereport was based on extensive interviews. Atrocities were committedby both the rebels and the military, but far more were attributed tothe Somali army, Boucher said.   After the United States ``conveyed our concern to Somalia,'' morethan 300 political prisoners were released, he said. However,Boucher added, the State Department is ``seriously disturbed'' by``backsliding'' as the result of summer demonstrations in Mogadishu.   The U.S. government has a defense agreement with Somalia mostlyfor use of a naval base. As a result of Somalia's human rightsabuses, a $2.5 million U.S. military support program was suspendedin June 1988.   A $20 million economic aid program, based on Somalia's conversionto a market economy and resulting hardships, was suspended in July.</TEXT></DOC>
