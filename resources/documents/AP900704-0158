Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman rebuffed in hisattempts to get a seat on the board of Koito Manufacturing Co.,plans to turn up the pressure by boosting his stake in the Japaneseauto parts supplier.   Pickens said he will move quickly to raise his stake in Koito to33 percent from 26 percent, despite having his request for fourboard seats soundly rejected at Koito's annual stockholders meetinglast week.   ``We'll probably start this week,'' Pickens said Wednesday.``We'd like to move up to one-third ownership if we can.''   Pickens has spent $1 billion on his stake so far. He said itwould cost about $200 million more to buy the 10 million sharesthat would bring him to 33 percent. With such a stake, Pickens saidJapanese law would allow him to take part in some decisions made byKoito management.   ``The reason is that it gives us additional power as astockholder,'' Pickens said. ``That threshold is important incorporate Japan.''   Pickens and Koito have been battling for the past 16 months.Pickens, the company's largest shareholder, has demanded seats onKoito's board. Koito has said Pickens is interested only in``greenmail'' and points to his reputation as a corporate raider.   Greenmail is a practice of buying up large amounts of acompany's stock to force the company to buy it back at a premium tomaintain control.   Pickens and a delegation of about 50 Americans stormed out ofKoito's annual meeting last week after a stormy session that pittedhis delegation against the company's Japanese shareholders.   He said he had a tape recording of insults that Japaneseshareholders yelled to the American delegation during the meeting.He said the Japanese called the Americans dumb and repeatedly toldthem to go home.   ``The translator was telling us some of them but I wasn't awarethat this was going on'' at the time, Pickens said, addingg that hereceived a translation of the tape this week.   Pickens has long contended that Koito management is biasedagainst foreigners and participates in Japan's keiretsu system,which links companies and their suppliers.   Pickens believes that Toyota Motor Co., Koito's second-largeststockholder and the biggest buyer of its parts, has played a majorrole behind the scenes to keep him and his representatives off thecompany's board.   He has contended that Toyota uses its muscle to win lower pricesfrom Koito and thereby gain profits at the expense of Koitoshareholders.   Pickens plans to take his complaints to the InternationalEconomic Summit in Houston next week.   ``I will certainly talk to anybody that will listen about theunfairness that I see in corporate Japan,'' he said. ``We are foolsto open our markets to the Japanese when they don't allow us toparticipate in theirs.''</TEXT></DOC>
