<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-12-0853 </DOCNO><TEXT>It is shown that resonant excitation of large amplitude (andgt; or approx.10/sup 4/ V cm/sup -1/) plasma waves is possible through the beatingof two microwaves of nearly equal frequencies in an ''open'' resonatorfilled with plasma of subcritical density. Detailed calculations arepresented of the configuration, growth and saturation of the pump andplasma waves in the resonant cavity.</TEXT></DOC>
