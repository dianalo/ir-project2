Reports that U.S. pilots captured in Iraq would be used as&quot;human shields&quot; helped temper investor zeal. Analysts notedthat the war is likely to become a drag on stock prices untilpeace is at hand.</LP><TEXT>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 17.57 points to2629.21. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index lost 1.17 to331.06, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index eased0.49 to 180.38 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index slipped0.38 to 306.90.   Big Board advancers trailed decliners, 732 to 771. Volumetotaled a mild 136,290,000 shares, far below Friday's robust226,770,000 shares.   Last week, the industrial average surged more than 145points after the U.S. attacked Iraq. That rally erased theerosion the market had suffered since late December.Technical analysts say there are plenty of stockholderswaiting to dump their shares when the industrial average isbetween 2650 and 2700.   Meanwhile, any benefit that the war could have on stockprices has been largely exhausted.   &quot;The superiority of the allied forces and the confidenceof an eventual victory was already reflected in stock pricesas of last Thursday,&quot; says James R. Solloway, director ofresearch at Argus Research.   He adds that only Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's demise,mass defections by Iraqi troops, or some other important steptoward peace is likely to have a positive impact on themarket.   In the meantime, other factors will demand the attentionof investors, such as the domestic economy and the profits ofpublic companies.   Some stronger-than-expected earnings reports amongtechnology companies helped boost the stock market last week.But as fourth-quarter earnings continue to be reported,disappointments are inevitable, analysts say.   For example, L.A. Gear plunged 2 7/8, or nearly 22%, to 101/2. The sneaker maker said it expects to report afourth-quarter loss of as much as 30 cents a share, comparedwith a profit of 58 cents a share a year earlier. The companyadded that it has asked its banks to waive certaincredit-line provisions because the quarter's loss mayconstitute a technical default under L.A. Gear's credit line.The news spurred analysts to cut their earnings estimates forthe company.   Meanwhile, defense stocks became sudden heroes on WallStreet, surging ahead of most other sectors of the market.   The dazzling success of the weapons systems that theindustry produces, now getting their first workout in thePersian Gulf war, has momentarily overshadowed the industry'sbleak outlook.   Dow Jones's market-weighted index of aerospace and defensestocks surged about 2.3%, while profit-taking sapped the restof the market. The industrial average dropped about 0.7%.   Producers of the Tomahawk cruise missile, McDonnellDouglas and General Dynamics, made strong gains. McDonnellDouglas jumped 4 3/8 to 36 1/4, and General Dynamics rose 4to 29 1/4.   Patriot missile maker Raytheon leapt 4 1/2 to 74 5/8.Martin Marietta surged 3 5/8 to 50.   Among other defense stocks, Loral rose 2 3/4 to 38 1/2,E-Systems jumped 3 1/2 to 38 5/8, and Northrop added 1 1/4 to20 5/8.   But industry analysts caution that the market's love ofdefense stocks will probably cool soon. There is littleindication that the success of high-technology weapons willhalt the erosion of defense spending. And analysts say thatunless the war is much longer than expected, replacementorders aren't likely to produce a significant boost indefense industry revenues.   Salomon Brothers' defense industry analyst George Shapiroadvises that the rally in the group be taken as a sellingopportunity by those already holding the stocks, rather thanas a signal for investors to buy more shares.   &quot;Defense spending will continue to go down over the nextseveral years,&quot; says Mr. Shapiro, noting that the procurementpart of the federal budget in particular is likely to keepshrinking.   &quot;I don't see a big demand for replacement,&quot; he adds.   Citicorp led the most active list, up 1/8 to 13 3/8 onvolume of more than 8.3 million shares. Traders citecontinued dividend-related trading in the stock for causingthe heavy volume.   Boeing was down 3/4 to 48 1/2. The company is reported tobe one of three companies that together are owed more than $1billion by Eastern Airlines. Eastern ceased operationsFriday. Another of Eastern's creditors, General Electric,lost 1/2 to 57 3/8.   Some airline stocks are higher as investors bet on whichcompanies will benefit from Eastern's demise. Delta Air Lineswas up 3/4 to 67 3/4 and USAir rose 1 1/8 to 19 3/4. Deltaannounced that it will buy 18 gates from Eastern for $41.4million.   Becton Dickinson tumbled 4 to 69. The company reportedprofit of 75 cents a share in its fiscal first quarter, belowanalysts' projections.   Burlington Northern dropped 1 5/8 to 29 5/8. Late Friday,the company reported fourth-quarter operating profit of 50cents a share, compared with net income of $1.06 a share ayear earlier. An extraordinary credit in the latest fourthquarter boosted profit to 58 cents a share. Revenue slippedto $1.16 billion from $1.18 billion.   Varian Associates jumped 2 3/8 to 35 3/4. The companyearned a profit of 64 cents a share in its fiscal firstquarter, at the high end of analysts' estimates and wellabove the 42 cents a share in profit from continuingoperations posted a year earlier.   Clorox lost 3/4 to 38 7/8. The company reported fiscalsecond-quarter profit of 38 cents a share, at the low end ofanalysts' estimates and below the 49 cents a share in profitreported a year earlier.   Eljer Industries eased 1/8 to 6 after estimating that itwill post a fourth-quarter loss of about 33 cents to 38 centsa share, blaming a protracted decline in the U.S. housingconstruction industry and a substantial drop in sales toretail outlets in the quarter. Eljer also said it may cut orsuspend future dividend payments.   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index eased 0.03to 303.92. Volume fell to 6,990,000 shares from 11,270,000Friday.
