Ranked as the best of 250 American jobs is a career few childrenare likely to have heard of, much less name: an actuary. Next arecomputer programmer, computer systems analyst, mathematician andstatistician.   Typical, more glamorous children's career choices like being adancer, doctor or astronaut also fared poorly in the almanac'soverall listing because they rated at or near the bottom in atleast one of the six ranking criteria.   According to the almanac, published this month by AmericanReferences Inc. of Chicago, the worst job listed in the ranking wasmigrant worker, which rated near or at the bottom in all six of thecriteria.   The second worst _ commercial fishing _ also was ranked lowbecause of long hours, seasonal work, high government regulationand tough physical demands. That was followed by constructionworker, roofer, seaman, dairy farmer, roustabout, lumberjack,cowboy and professional football player.   Almanac Editor and Publisher Les Krantz identified the criteriaused to judge jobs as salary, stress, work environment, outlook,security and physical demands.   ``Most of the best paying jobs are performed in highlycompetitive and physically confining environments for long hours,''Krantz said. ``Don't expect a cushy job if you want to earn morethan $50,000 a year.''   But ultimately, he added, ``The job best for an individual isthe one the person likes the best, and that depends a lot onsomeone's priorities.''   Astronauts have the worst working environment, with surgeonssecond, the book concluded. Firefighters have the longest workweeks and their jobs are the most stressful and physicallydemanding, it said.   But actuaries _ who interpret statistics to determine expectedpersonal losses due to sickness or disability and material lossesfrom disasters _ did well in all six categories.   A 23-year old actuary in training, Mike Vaughan, said he agreedwith the assessment.   ``Once the (training) exams are over, I'd say the stress wouldbe pretty much non-existent, and the job market is so open I couldjust walk out and find a new job in a day,'' he said.   Vaughan, who works for Allstate Insurance Co. in suburbanNorthbrook, said his $31,000 annual salary ``was probably 20 to 25percent higher than any other job I could have gotten, and it goesup faster.''   William Hermes, a fisherman for 47 years, said he wasn'tbothered by his job's low ranking and couldn't imagine making aliving any other way.   ``It's the only job I've ever wanted,'' said Hermes, 62, ownerof Big Bay DeNoc Fisheries in Garden, Mich. ``You're out in theopen, you're your own boss and you don't have to answer to nobody.''   Krantz said most of the information for the almanac comes fromthe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Commerce andthe Census Bureau, but tracking down some statistics, like acowboy's wages, took some legwork.   ``We literally called cattle ranches and they told us: `Well, ifyou have a good horse you can make about $150 a week,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
