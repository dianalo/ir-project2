AFRICAN PRESIDENT SEEKS TO GET ANC INTOCONSTITUTION TALKS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     De Klerk sought to regain some of the momentum in his campaign to draw theAfrican National Congress into talks on constitutional change that may havebeen lost because of the scandal.;    He pointedly restated his view thatpower sharing could be negotiated to cover the period during which a newconstitution was forged, though he repeated his rejection of the ANC's callfor an interim government.;    &quot;As far as I am concerned, the subject oftransitional arrangements may be the first item on the agenda,&quot; de Klerk saidof the talks that he has proposed. De Klerk stressed that he did not think theoutcry over the secret funding of Inkatha should be allowed to stall thenegotiation process.;    &quot;I do not think that what has happened will preventthe negotiations from taking off the ground,&quot; de Klerk said. &quot;There is noother alternative for South Africa.&quot;;    The president, confronted with themost serious challenge to his credibility since taking office nearly two yearsago, stopped short of apologizing for the undercover payments to Inkatha. Hepromised that an advisory committee of private citizens would be appointed tooversee secret expenditures.;    &quot;In view of the latest controversy, everysecret project is being looked at again,&quot; de Klerk said, adding that spendingon covert activities had been exaggerated.;    Of $133 million budgeted for asecret fund this year, the president said, less than $15 million was earmarkedfor secret projects. Most of the rest, he said, went for routine operatingexpenses of the National Intelligence Service, South Africa's counterpart tothe CIA.;    He reminded his audience that the covert projects dated back tothe era when sanctions threatened to &quot;strangle&quot; South Africa and when the ANCwas waging guerrilla war against white minority rule.;    De Klerk said he wasunaware that his government was funding Inkatha until the scandal broke 11days ago.;    De Klerk launched his effort to restore trust in his governmentTuesday by demoting two key ministers responsible for the security forces.;   Magnus Malan, the defense minister, was given responsibility for forestry andwater, while Adriaan Vlok, the Minister of Law and Order, was put in charge ofthe nation's prison system.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Pretoria, South Africa  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910731  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  452  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 31, 199100213211,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
