DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After sitting silently in a courtroom where heis on trial on 12 Iran-Contra charges, former National SecurityCouncil aide Oliver North returned to the lecture circuit Thursdayto tell a conservative audience that he is ``still very wary'' ofthe reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.   ``I may be a lonely voice, but I will urge all of you to watchvery closely what Mr. Gorbachev does,'' North told a dinner audienceat a conference sponsored by the World Media Association.   North, who is charged with lying to Congress about his allegedfund-raising for Nicaraguan Contras at a time support for the rebelforces had been outlawed, said Gorbachev ``is continuing to armNicaragua and Cuba to the point where America could well be forcedin the future to move forces from Europe and elsewhere around theworld to defend our own southern border.''   In his trial in U.S. District Court here, North has mostly satsilently and listened as witnesses give varying portrayals of hisconduct as a member of the National Security Council staff in theReagan White House.   In his speech, he said he found himself ``out of work and in thisnew venue, given a chance to speak without a subpoena.''   He said in the past eight years ``freedom fighter movements ...truly have raised up new aspirations for the freedom of millions''in Nicaragua and elsewhere.   As for Soviet reforms, he said, ``There has been no reduction,but rather an increase in support for radical communist regimes likethat in Libya, in Cuba, Angola and Nicaragua.''   ``Despite the vast publicity, I must tell you that I personallyam still very wary,'' North said. ``Today, inside the Soviet Unionit is in vogue to criticize former dictators, but not the currentdictator.''   Earlier, black veterans of the civil rights movement, describingthemselves as conservatives, criticized news coverage of racialissues, portraying the media as distractive or even hostile.   James Meredith, who in 1961 was the first black student to enrollin the University of Mississippi, said, ``A very small band ofconspirators bent on dominating world affairs have maneuvered andswayed all the media in the Western Christian world.''   ``This group, which I will refer to as the liberal elite, hasdetermined that the subjugation of the black race is critical to thesuccess of its scheme to control the world,'' Meredith said.   Roy Innis, a director of the Committee on Racial Equality, said,``The media has exhibited a schizoid and dichotomous behavior onrace relations in America and also in the rest of the world.''   ``On one hand that behavior has at times in terms of racerelations has been beneficial, but at most times, in particular atthis time, it has been invidious,'' he said.   Innis praised aspects of media coverage of the civil rightsmovement in the 1960s, saying, ``Without the media friendly I don'tthink much of the gains we made could have been made.''   At the same time, he said, the media depicted whites in the Southas ``bad guys'' and those in the North as ``good guys'' and ignored``the decency and commmitment for change that was being expressed bymany white Southerners in order to project this simplistic vision ofgood guy, bad guy.''   Jim Martin, identified as a a founding member of the StudentNon-violent Coordinating Committee, told the group, ``The media andthe civil rights movement and its leaders and organizations are infact allies ... in a war and that is the war ... to detract thepeople from fundamental issues of justice, common sense andpolitical reality.''   ``Now I am not going to attribute all of these sinister motivesto a cabal of media professionals and civil rights leaders,'' hesaid. ``It's just a crazy coincidence of timing that goes back many,many years.''   James Bevell, a former strategist for the Rev. Martin LutherKing, however, suggested that unfavorable images of some blackpolitical leaders in the news media are the fault of the blacks andnot the media.   Responding to a question about coverage of District of ColumbiaMayor Marion Barry and other black political figures, Bevell said,``There is not an elected black official in America today that hasconstitutional consciousness.''   ```The media is not attacking black people,'' he said. ``Theblack guys are not qualified, and will not say to the white guys whoknow constitutional principles, `I would like to serve as anapprentice' ... and so they play like they know government.''   John Nettles, national vice chairman of the Southern ChristianLeadership Conference, was moderator of the panel.   The discussion took place at the 10th World Media Conference ofthe World Media Association, sponsored by the Washington Times Corp.and News World Communications Inc. The association, which describesitself as an organization devoted to journalistic ethics, wasfounded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon of the Unification Church.</TEXT></DOC>
