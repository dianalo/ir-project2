George Dewey sailed into Manila Bay, defeated the Spanish navyand accepted the surrender of Spain's only Asian colony.   This week, nearly a century later, the military ties werereinforced when the Bush administration ordered F-4 Phantom jets tomake a show of force to help Corazon Aquino's government defenditself against an attempted coup.   The flights over rebel-held basst evidence of acontinuing strong American relationship with the one-time U.S.colony that is now home to the two largest U.S. foreign militaryinstallations.   President Bush authorized the U.S. military support early Fridaywhile en route to Maltes were the latea for the U.S.-Soviet summit.   Besides air cover from U.S. fighter jets over the rebel-held airbases, a contingent of about 100 Marines was sent to Manila to helpguard the U.S. Embassy compound there, a Pentagon official said.   The attempt to oust Aquino was the most serious since she wasswept to power in a civilian-military uprising in February 1986that forced the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos into exile.   Just a few weeks ago, Mrs. Aquino visited Wasuss thefuture of Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smallerinstallations. The future of American military bases is consideredthe most important and most controversial issue facing the twocountries.   Some Filipinos view a continued U.S. military presence as aninfringement on Philippine sovereignty and an unwanted leftoverfrom the former U.S. colonial administration.   But U.S. officials regard the bases as vital for projectingAmerican military power throughout Southeast Asian sea lanes andfor stability in the Pacific. The U.S. bases serve as acounterpoint to Soviet naval forces based in Vietnam.   The bases are officially under Philippine command but, ineffect, are run by the United States. The Military Bases Agreementwas signed in 1947, the year after the Philippines becameindependent, and come up for renewal every five years.   More than 60,000 Filipinos are employed at the bases, whereabout 40,000 U.S. troops and their dependents are stationed.   The United States has been the Philippine military's main armssupplier in its 20-year-old battle with communist rebels.   In October, Vice President Dan Quayle said the administrationmight ask Congress to let the Philippines use U.S. foreign aid tobolster internal security against communist insurgents. Quayle'scomments came after two American military base workers wereambushed and killed by communist rebels.   Two years ago, three Americans were killed by communist rebelsnear Clark Air Base. Rebels have threatened more attacks because ofU.S. support for Mrs. Aquino's counterinsurgency campaign.   During Mrs. Aquino's recent visit, U.S. and Philippine officialssigned a $25 million aid agreement to lay the groundwork fortransportation and other infrastructure projects.   When Mrs. Aquino visited the United States after first takingoffice, Congress rushed through a $200 million aid package for thePhilippines. Now, however, some lawmakers believe economic reformand increased trade would do more to improve Filipinos' livingstandards than increased economic aid would.   The U.S.-Philippine relationship has not been without acrimonyand even bloodshed.   The Americans forged the alliance with Filipino rebels led byEmilio Aguinaldo, who had declared independence from Spain twomonths earlier. However, pressure mounted in the United States onPresident William McKinley to annex the Philippines as a colony anddeny Philippine independence.   On Feb. 6, 1899, with just a vote to spare, the U.S. Senateratified a treaty formally ending the Spanish-American War andceding the Philippines to the United States.   That triggered the Philippine Insurrections, a bloody,three-year conflict in which, according to Philippine records,250,000 U.S. troops slaughtered 1 million Filipinos.   The United States granted The Philippines independence July 4,1946.</TEXT></DOC>
