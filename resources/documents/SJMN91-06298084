Silva said cityofficials should have spelled out the existing costs -- $760,000 a year --more than half of which goes for validated parking for library patrons.;  Such figures matter when San Jose officials try to fend off charges fromowners of private parking lots that the city is undercutting their business.;  They matter, too, when officials assert that the parking subsidy will lureshoppers, spur the economy and reap untold new tax revenues. The city councilwill review the downtown parking policy next month.;   &quot;Historically, thejustification to continue the program has been the city or agency's economicdevelopment and redevelopment plans,&quot; Silva wrote. &quot;However, neither the citynor the agency has quantified what benefits the program has actuallyproduced.;   &quot;In other words, there seems to be an unchallengeable assumptionthat the downtown parking program is worth whatever it costs the city.&quot;;  City officials disputed Silva's conclusions. They agreed to try to measure howwell the subsidy works.;   &quot;However, we are not confident that we will ever beable to quantify how much the free and validated parking . . . (contributes)to the revitalization of downtown,&quot; Deputy City Manager Dan McFadden wrote.;  McFadden argued that the parking subsidy is nevertheless worthwhile.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NICK ANDERSON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911024  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  314  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 24, 199100298084,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
