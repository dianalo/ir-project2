The flow,combustion and heat transfer model equations are solved numerically usingthe Simpler algorithm. The physical processes taking place in the furnaceare discussed and the numerical results are compared with those basedon the gray-gas computations. Local heat fluxes at the load and resultsof extensive parametric calculations are reported. The results showingthe effect of furnace size, thermal insulation of refractories, sinktemperature, sink emissivity, incoming temperature of fresh mixture,excess air, heat load, firing angle, oxygen enrichment, and other parametersare reported in the paper.</TEXT></DOC>
