It's new president, Bostonian William McCarthy, reportedly isn't a great Dukakis fan. On the other hand, the Reagan administration hasn't been much inhibited by past Teamster support in its search for evidence of Teamster corruption. To get help, Teamster leaders are taking a poll of members. That doesn't mean that the union has suddenly become a paragon of democratic process, but it is a model the other AFL-CIO leaders might at least consider the next time they are faced with political-endorsement decisions. </TEXT></DOC>
