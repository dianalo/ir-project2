<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-46-0223 </DOCNO><TEXT>A proximity fuze system includes an optical ranging apparatus, a detonationcircuit controlled by the optical ranging apparatus, and an explosivecharge detonated by the detonation circuit. The optical ranging apparatusincludes a pulsed laser light source for generating target ranging lightpulses and optical reference light pulses. A single lens directs rangingpulses to a target and collects reflected light from the target. An opticalfiber bundle is used for delaying the optical reference pulses to correspondto a predetermined distance from the target. The optical ranging apparatusincludes circuitry for providing a first signal depending upon the lightpulses reflected from the target, a second signal depending upon thelight pulses from the optical delay fiber bundle, and an output signalwhen the first and second signals coincide with each other. The outputsignal occurs when the distance from the target is equal to the predetermineddistance from the target. Additional circuitry distinguishes pulses reflectedfrom the target from background solar radiation. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
