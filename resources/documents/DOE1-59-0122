<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-59-0122 </DOCNO><TEXT>In deformed Hartree-Fock calculations with Skyrme interactions, a neardegeneracy of the intrinsic state energies of n-particle, n-hole (Np-Nh)deformed states with differing n has been obtained. For example, in /sup40/Ca the 8p-8h intrinsic state energy is close to but even lower thanthat of the 4p-4h deformed state. Whether there is an underlying symmetryto explain this near degeneracy has yet to be determined.</TEXT></DOC>
