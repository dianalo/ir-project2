A goal has been set to achieve zero net increasein per capital crude oil consumption by 1985, and to reduce the annualincrease in total energy demand to 2.2%. As part of these goals, a 15-yearenergy from waste program has been initiated; the aim is to utilize municipalwaste, sewage sludge, commercial and industrial refuse, agriculturaland forest waste, and industrial by-product heat to produce 3.2% of primaryenergy needs. However, since about half of all petroleum products areconsumed in transportation, fuel substitution policies are being concentratedin this latter area. Fuel alcohols are one of the alternatives, and someprograms have been developed to investigate this option. The feasibilityof farm-scale ethanol production, hybrid poplar farming for energy-relateduses such as methanol production, the economics of alcohol plant location,and use of fuel alcohol in internal combustion engines are among theresearch projects being conducted. Incentives have also been introducedto promote alternative fuels in transportation: a variety of fuels, includingalcohol, have been exempted from the provincial gasoline tax, and thesales tax has been removed from vehicles powered by alternative fuelssuch as propane, natural gas and fuel alcohols.</TEXT></DOC>
