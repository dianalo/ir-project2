Arne Carlson signed a bill that gives NWAInc.'s Northwest Airlines $740 million in financialassistance, including $320 million of direct loans for thecarrier's operations.   The financial package, cleared after intense lobbying byNorthwest and its co-chairman, Alfred Checchi, is an attemptby the closely held carrier to keep in step with industrygiants UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, AMR Corp.'s AmericanAirlines and Delta Air Lines.</LP><TEXT>   Those carriers have been issuing major equity offerings inrecent months, largely to raise money to purchase routes,planes, airport facilities and other assets shed byfinancially weak carriers such as now-defunct EasternAirlines, Pan Am Corp.'s Pan American World Airways and TransWorld Airlines.   The money would represent important financial assistancefor Northwest at a time when the airline industry is beinghammered by heavy losses. &quot;The Checchi team has proven veryadept at raising funds from nontraditional sources,&quot; saidSamuel Buttrick, an airline analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.in New York. But &quot;cash is cash,&quot; he said.   Kathleen Gaylord, director of state government affairs atNorthwest, said the Eagan, Minn., carrier primarily plans touse the $320 million to add new A-320 jets manufactured byAirbus Industrie, a European consortium, to its fleet. Shesaid Northwest would accelerate options it has alreadynegotiated for the jets.   Besides the direct financing, the state's financial aidwill help to construct two maintenance facilities in thestate. Mr. Checchi yesterday tentatively picked Duluth andHibbing as the sites for the facilities. Final selectiondepends on various state and airport authority approvals,which are expected.   Minnesota lawmakers passed last week the $740 millionpackage of revenue bonds and an estimated $40 million in taxincentives to entice Northwest to build the two facilities inthe state. Northwest said it plans to employ 2,000 newworkers at the sites.   The package includes $350 million to build the maintenancebases and an additional $390 million that would be secured byNorthwest property, possibly including its headquarters andairport facilities. Of the $390 million, $70 million would bekept in a reserve fund, and Northwest would get $320 millionin capital for its operations. The construction money wouldbe repaid through lease payments for the new facilities, saidMs. Gaylord. The capital funds would be repaid by refinancingexisting facility leases, she said.   Mr. Checchi praised the financing as &quot;the nation'sforemost example of a public-private partnership,&quot; boastingthat &quot;it brought together business leaders and labor leaders. . . Democrats and Republicans . . . the Iron Range andmetropolitan Minnesota.&quot;   Northwest is planning to ask the Minnesota State Board ofInvestment for $200 million in additional financing.   Northwest arranged another unorthodox financing last yearwhen it received an infusion of $500 million from AirbusIndustrie and U.S. engine maker General Electric Co. Inexchange, Northwest agreed to order 75 Airbus A-320 jets andtake options on additional jets. It also agreed to buyengines for the aircraft from a GE joint venture.   The Minnesota financing differs from a plan Colorado isarranging for United Airlines because the Colorado packagemostly involves tax breaks.   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer is proposing a package of taxcredits that could cost the state as much as $609 millionover the next 30 years to entice United to build amaintenance facility at Denver's new airport. The tax creditswould be in addition to $185 million in grants and aid and$23 million in local tax breaks the city and county of Denverare willing to provide. The state tax credits must beapproved at a special session of the state legislature. Thesession is slated to start next Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
