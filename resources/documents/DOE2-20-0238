During the same period the staff of theBiotest basin made weekly censuses of the basin. The aim of the censuseswas to establish if there was any increase in the number of waterfowlin the Biotest basin and its surroundings caused by the discharge ofcooling water from the two nuclear power reactors that are in operationin Forsmark. Seventeen waterfowl species were observed in the area duringthe period studied. Of these species five were regularly observed viz.:the Mute Swan (Cygnus olor), the Mallard (Anas plathyryncos), the TuftedDuck (Aythya fuligula), the Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) and the Goosander(Mergus merganser). The first four species were generally found in lownumbers in the Biotest basin and its surroundings, as well as in thereference area. This implies that the Biotest basin and its surroundingshas not become an area of importance during the winter for waterfowl,with one exception: the Goosander. The Goosander showed an increasingpopulation growth in the Biotest basin and its surroundings during thestudied period with a maximum average in in the basin during the lastwinter. As a result, the size of the Goosander population may affectthe number of small fish in the Biotest basin.</TEXT></DOC>
