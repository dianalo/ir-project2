But in Mr. Barbie's trial for Nazi war crimes, which began here yesterday, his lawyer is the same Mr. Verges who fought against him in the resistance and later went on to work for the communists in Prague, run guns for African revolutionaries and defend a host of left-wing terrorists.    &quot;The man is an exceptional living contradiction,&quot; says Herve Cren, a Paris lawyer.    A champion of revolutionary causes, Mr. Verges (pronounced Vair-Zhess) is also a dandy with a fondness for fat cigars and good wine. A publicity-hungry man who was recently photographed in a bubble bath, he refuses to shed light on an eight-year hole in his life. A man of the law, he says &quot;my law is to have no laws.&quot; A Eurasian who says he was marked by racism as a child, he is now defending a former Nazi accused of deporting Jews to death camps, handpicked by Mr. Barbie's daughter as perhaps the only lawyer in France who can help her father.    For the 62-year-old Mr. Verges, representing the man called the Butcher of Lyon could be the high point of his career. He has devoted his professional life to shocking France. This highly publicized trial may give him his best opportunity yet.    Unlike some right-wing lawyers that Mr. Barbie could have chosen, Mr. Verges has no intention of defending a Nazi's acts. Rather, he will attack French society. He will compare French atrocities during the Algerian war with those of the Nazis. He will open old wounds by reiterating the charge that most Frenchmen collaborated with the Nazis.    His goal, Mr. Verges says, is to turn the trial away from Mr. Barbie and make it &quot;a trial of France.&quot; His hope is to win some sympathy for a man described in the French press as a sadist who terrorized prisoners for fun.    Indeed, Mr. Verges has made it his specialty to take on what most lawyers consider undefensible cases. At his office in a Paris townhouse, seated before a 17th-century tapestry of a peacock, he says during an interview that he takes such cases for &quot;the professional challenge.&quot;    Some say he is simply a man who revels in controversy. &quot;There's a side to him that's like a little brat who loves letting off firecrackers,&quot; says Francis Szpiner, a lawyer and friend.    But others say he has darker motives. &quot;The common thread,&quot; says a prominent French lawyer, &quot;is an attempt to destabilize democracy.&quot;    Adds Bernard-Henri Levy, a leading French writer who based a character in one of his novels on Mr. Verges: &quot;He's one of the last pure totalitarian intellectuals&quot; and &quot;an agent of influence for the East bloc.&quot;    Many think that Mr. Verges is motivated by what Jean-Francois Kahn, editor of the weekly magazine L'Evenement du Jeudi, calls a &quot;hatred of Western society&quot; born out of his colonial youth and a desire for revenge.    Thus, critics say, what appears contradictory actually is coherent. &quot;It interests him less to defend Barbie than to make this a trial of Israel's Zionism, of colonialism and of France in Algeria,&quot; says Mr. Kahn. &quot;It's a link in the chain of revenge.&quot;    Jacques Verges doesn't deny that his past experiences color his current attitudes and activities. He and his twin brother, Paul, were born in 1925 in Thailand (then Siam), the sons of a French consular official whose marriage to a Vietnamese woman had forced him out of the service. After a brief spell in Laos, the family returned to the father's home of La Reunion, the French territory off the east coast of Africa.    Mr. Verges says he was deeply scarred by the treatment of nonwhites in a colonial society. &quot;Yellow people didn't have to wear the yellow star,&quot; he says, referring to the Star of David that Jews were forced to wear under the Nazis. &quot;It was written on their face.&quot;    Mr. Verges left La Reunion at age 17 to join the French resistance and &quot;fight against Nazi racism.&quot; When the war ended, he settled in Paris, began studying history and became a member of the Communist Party.    Communism runs in the family: Mr. Verges's father was a founder of the Communist Party in La Reunion and was elected in 1946 to the French National Assembly. During the campaign, Paul Verges -- who has now succeeded his father in the National Assembly -- was convicted of killing his father's political opponent.    Jacques Verges was an active Communist, too: In 1949, he founded an association of colonial students whose members included Pol Pot, future leader of the Khmer Rouge. Mr. Verges describes Pol Pot, who was accused of massive slayings in Cambodia in the 1970s, as a man with &quot;many qualities&quot; and &quot;a sense of humor.&quot; And he refuses to condemn the Khmer Rouge because he has no &quot;direct information.&quot;    Mr. Verges's zeal so impressed the Communist Party that he was sent in 1950 to Prague, where he was a top member of the International Union of Students, specializing in propaganda. Another member was Alexander Shelepin, who later became head of the KGB. Mr. Verges stayed in Prague until 1954, throughout the Stalinist purges. But he doesn't condemn Stalinism. &quot;People always talk about Stalinist terror,&quot; he once said. &quot;They forget the lyricism and friendship.&quot;    Upon his return to Paris in 1954, Mr. Verges completed his studies and joined the bar in 1955. The Algerian War had just begun, and he sympathized with what he saw as a fight against colonialism.    He broke with the Communist Party in 1957 over its conservative position on Algeria and became involved with Algeria's National Liberation Front. Mr. Verges was its lawyer in a number of spectacular trials in France during which he developed what he calls his &quot;judicial strategy of rupture&quot;: Rather than contest the charges, he ignored them and used the courtroom as a forum to justify terrorist acts committed by his clients against the French.    One of those clients was Djamila Bouhired, who was convicted of planting bombs in crowded cafes in Algiers. When she was freed in 1962 after Algeria became independent, Mr. Verges converted to Islam and married her.    Mr. Verges's provocative tactics so infuriated the French that he was suspended from the bar for a year in 1961. But he wasn't jobless. He went to Morocco and became a gunrunner for independence movements in countries such as Angola, Mozambique and Guinea Bissau.    In 1962, Mr. Verges returned to Algeria and was publisher of a monthly magazine, African Revolution. But he soon had a disagreement with the Algerian government and returned to Paris, where he published another monthly, Revolution.    When a new government came to power in Algeria in 1965, it asked Mr. Verges to go to Israel to defend an accused Palestinian terrorist. And Mr. Verges found a new cause. In 1969, he published a book attacking Zionism and the &quot;international billionaires&quot; who he says support Israel.    In 1970, Mr. Verges disappeared. He told friends he was going to Spain, but there is no evidence he went there. And wherever he may have gone, he wasn't heard of again until 1978, when he reappeared in Paris. Where was he? &quot;I was on the other side of the mirror,&quot; he replies.    His disappearance has fueled a variety of theories, none of which Mr. Verges confirms or denies. Among them: He was in Cambodia with his old friend Pol Pot; he was in Yemen or Lebanon training with terrorist groups; he was in Moscow; he was in jail in Algeria because of debts or in jail in China because of trouble with Maoists.    Whatever the case, Mr. Verges returned to the Paris bar in 1979. Since then, he has taken on a succession of terrorist cases that have put him in the spotlight. They have included Bruno Breguet and Magdalena Kopp, two presumed allies of the shadowy international terrorist Carlos; two members of Action Directe, the left-wing urban-terrorist group; the leader of an Armenian terrorist group accused of planting a deadly bomb at a Paris airport; and, most recently, Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, the presumed leader of the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction.    In all these trials, says a member of France's Conseil d'Etat, the nation's legal-watchdog body, Mr. Verges's defense of the terrorists was so vigorous that &quot;it raises the question whether Verges himself shouldn't be in jail.&quot;    And now comes the Barbie trial. Mr. Verges intends to make waves by contesting France's black-and-white version of World War II, whereby France overcame Nazi oppression through a collective, heroic battle.    &quot;For 40 years,&quot; he says, &quot;France has lived with an official truth that is in fact an official lie. . . . France was fascinated with fascism. . . . The resistance was divided. And between those groups of resistants and collaborators, there were gangways.&quot;    In forcing France to reexamine its past, Mr. Verges will evoke the Algerian War. His main argument, he says, will be that France committed unpunished atrocities there that at least rivaled those of the Nazis, and thus Mr. Barbie is no more guilty than French soldiers. &quot;After doing what was done in Algeria, it's singularly audacious to declare an amnesty on what we did and declare that what others did to us cannot be forgotten,&quot; he says.    Many Frenchmen agree that France committed &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; in Algeria. But Mr. Verges's line profoundly disturbs them because it &quot;blurs the specificity of the Nazi massacre,&quot; in the words of one lawyer. Even Mr. Szpiner, who admires Mr. Verges, says that France wasn't engaged in systematic extermination in Algeria.    &quot;The weakness of Verges's defense,&quot; says Mr. Szpiner, is that &quot;we should stop judging people under the pretext that there were other low-lifes after them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
