The effects of induction system, chargemotion, bore-stroke ratio, compression ratio, mixture preparation, aswell as the implementation of a control strategy for a reduction in enginecycle to cycle variation and a split cooling system were discussed. Furthermorea new generation of oxidation-catalysts was presented, which offer ahigher convertion rate in a wider working area. Although on one handthe potential of lean burn engines even at displacements above 2 l isassessed positively on the other hand it is criticized that the currentlean burn concepts do not allow a significant reduction in exhaust gasemissions at higher vehicle speeds. It was therefore discussed to combinethe advantages of both lean burn and {lambda}=1 concepts to achieve bestfuel consumption at part load in combination with improved exhaust emissionsat higher load, i.e. high speeds.</TEXT></DOC>
