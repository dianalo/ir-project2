The 31-year-old plant, which was the oldest operatingcommercial nuclear plant in the nation, was shut after theNuclear Regulatory Commission staff expressed concern thatits reactor containment vessel could crack in an emergencyand release radiation.</LP><TEXT>   Although it voluntarily shut the plant in Rowe, Mass.,Yankee Atomic Electric Co., the consortium of 10 Northeastutilities that own Yankee Rowe, said it disagrees with theNRC staff recommendation and hopes to restart the plant inthe future. Indeed, the NRC said the closing isn'tnecessarily permanent.   Nonetheless, the NRC staff recommendation is importantbecause Yankee Rowe is at the center of a growing debate overthe re-licensing of the nation's aging nuclear plants. Thecommission's handling of Yankee Rowe could signal a tougherroad ahead for scores of other aging nuclear power plantsseeking license renewal. Yankee Rowe's license is scheduledto expire in the year 2000 but it plans to seek an earlyrenewal.   The staff's recommendation is also seen as significantbecause the NRC has been considered pro-nuclear in the pastby many of its critics.   &quot;We're very pleased that the NRC staff has validated ourconcerns&quot; about Yankee Rowe, said Diane Curran, an attorneyfor the Union of Concerned Scientists, a critic of the plant.&quot;We went to see the commission months ago pointing out thatYankee Rowe's pressure {containment} vessel didn't meet theflexibility and safety standards to justify continuedoperation.&quot;   The group has said that the vessel has become so brittlethat it could crack and, in a worst-case scenario, result ina meltdown of the reactor's core.   The re-licensing of the nation's 111 operating nuclearplants is critical to the future of nuclear power in theU.S., because no new plants have been ordered since themid-1970s as a result of soaring construction costs andprotests by activists.   A pro-nuclear group, the U.S. Council for EnergyAwareness, insisted that the closing of Yankee Rowe isn't badnews for the nuclear-power industry. &quot;We look upon this as astep in the right direction, that in fact we, as a nation,can say we have a responsible regulator in government andresponsible nuclear operators,&quot; said Phillip Bayne, presidentof the council.   At issue is how much a power plant's key components areaffected by decades of neutron bombardment from uranium fuel.   In recommending an immediate shutdown of Yankee Rowe, theNRC staff reversed an earlier opinion issued in July. It saidthen that the plant could safely continue to operate untilnext April, when it is scheduled to shut for refueling, eventhough the steel reactor vessel didn't meet standards forstrength against possible fracture.   However, the NRC said new testing &quot;substantially reducedthe staff's confidence&quot; in the reactor containment vessel.   Safety equipment at Yankee Rowe, as at many nuclearplants, is designed to pump cool water in certain emergenciesinto the containment vessel to keep the nuclear core fromoverheating and, thus, prevent a meltdown that could resultin the release of radiation. But the danger is that in an oldreactor, the cool water coming into contact with the brittlecontainment vessel could cause the vessel to crack.   The NRC said its staff used a &quot;more realistic&quot; technicalmodel in its most recent tests that showed a higherprobability that the cool water would fracture the vessel.&quot;The NRC staff has determined that the risk is greater thanwas previously thought,&quot; an NRC spokesman said.   Yankee Rowe engineers had suggested mixing hot and coolwater so that the water pumped into the vessel in emergencieswould be warmer, reducing the &quot;thermal shock&quot; when the watercomes in contact with the steel plate of the containment.   However, the NRC indicated it still wasn't satisfied thatthe plant &quot;has adequate margins against failure duringoperation.&quot;   A spokesman for Yankee Rowe, whose owners includeNortheast Utilities, New England Electric System and BostonEdison Co., characterized the dispute as &quot;an issue thatreasonable people can disagree on. We hope to resolve thesedifferences when we meet, along with the NRC staff, beforethe Nuclear Regulatory Commission.&quot;   The shutdown of Yankee Rowe, a small 185,000-kilowattreactor, won't have a major impact on New England powersupply because the region now has excess generating capacity.   Although the effect of the NRC staff's recommendation onother plants remains to be seen, some analysts said othernuclear plants seeking license renewal can expect stricterreviews. About half of all operating nuclear power plantscould be reviewed for license extension by the year 2020.   &quot;The message now is loud and clear,&quot; said Gary Hovis,nuclear research director for Argus Research in New York.&quot;The NRC is simply going to crack down more and more in thefuture.&quot;   Industry supporters, however, questioned the extent towhich Yankee Rowe will become a test case for how otherrenewal applications are handled. &quot;Many of the reactors weremade with the aid of newer technology, and the treatment ofsteel used {in other vessels} and engineering are of a highergrade,&quot; than the steel in the Yankee Rowe vessel, said Mr.Bayne of the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness.</TEXT></DOC>
