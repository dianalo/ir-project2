Introduction </ITAG>Background In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. sections 9601-9657 (``CERCLA'' or the ``Act''),in response to the dangers of uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous wastesites. CERCLA was amended in 1986 by the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct (``SARA''), Pub. L. No. 99-499, stat. 1613 <T3>et seq. </T3>To implement CERCLA, the Environmental Protection Agency(``EPA'' or ``the Agency'') promulgated the revised National Oil and HazardousSubstances Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982(47 FR 31180) pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316(46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP, further revised by EPA on September16, 1985 (50 FR 37624) and November 20, 1985 (50 FR 47912), sets forthguidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases orthreatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.On December 21, 1988 (53 FR 51394), EPA proposed revisions to the NCP inresponse to SARA. Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the NCPinclude criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatenedreleases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedialaction and, to the extent practicable, take into account the potentialurgency of such action for the purpose of taking removal action. In responseto that mandate, EPA developed a model for assessing the relative riskposed by sites (the ``Hazard Ranking System'' or ``HRS''). Section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the statutorycriteria provided by the HRS be used to prepare a list of national prioritiesamong the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances,pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States. The list, whichis Appendix B of the NCP, is the National Priorities List (``NPL''). Section105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually. An original NPL of 406 sites was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR40658). The NPL has been expanded since then, most recently on July 22,1987 (52 FR 27620). The Agency has also published a number of proposedrulemakings to add sites to the NPL, most recently Update andplusmin;7 onJune 24, 1988 (53 FR 23988). EPA announced on June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21056),that it would list Federal facility sites in a separate section of theNPL, using the same technical criteria that qualify non-Federal sites.EPA may delete sites from the NPL when no further response is appropriate,as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(7). To date, the Agency hasdeleted 24 sites from the NPL, 8 of them since the June 1988 proposed rule.They are:<ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; September 1, 1988 (53 FR 33811) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Tri-City Oil Conservationist, Inc., Tampa, Florida </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Varsol Spill (once listed as part of Biscayne aquifer), Miami, Florida</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; December 23, 1988 (53 FR 51780) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Toftdahl Drums, Brush Prairie, Washington </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2124) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Matthews Electroplating, Roanoke County, Virginia </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; February 13, 1989 (54 FR 6521) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Presque Isle, Erie, Pennsylvania </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; February 21, 1989 (54 FR 7424) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Parramore Surplus, Mount Pleasant, Florida </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; February 22, 1989 (54 FR 7548) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Cooper Road, Voorhees Township, New Jersey </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">andbullet; February 22, 1989 (54 FR 7549) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Krysowaty Farm, Hillsborough, New Jersey.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">EPA has also published several notices of intent to delete sites.This rule adds eight Federal facility sites to the NPL, expands two Federalfacility sites, and reclassifies one private site to a Federal facilitiysite. EPA has carefully considered public comments submitted for the sitesin today's final rule. This rule results in a final NPL of 799 sites, 41of them in the Federal section; 370 sites are in proposed status, 22 ofthem in the Federal section. With these changes, final and proposed sitesnow total 1,169. EPA includes on the NPL sites at which there are or have been releasesor threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.The discussion below may refer to ``releases or threatened releases'' simplyas ``releases'', ``facilities'', or ``sites''. Information Available to the Public The Headquarters and Regional public dockets for the NPL (see <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>portion of this notice) contain documents relating tothe scoring of sites in this final rule. The dockets are available forviewing ``by appointment only'' after the appearance of this notice. Thehours of operation for the Headquarters dockets are from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00p.m., Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays. Please contactindividual Regional dockets for hours. The Headquarters docket contains HRS score sheets for each final site,a Documentation Record for each site describing the information used tocompute the score, pertinent information for any site affected by specialstudy waste, information for sites affected by the policy for listing sitessubject to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA),a list of documents referenced in the Documentation Record, comments received,and the Agency's response to those comments. The Agency's responses arecontained in the ``Support Document for the Revised National PrioritiesList_Final Federal Facility Site Update, March 1989.''Each Regional docket includes all information available in the Headquartersdocket for sites in that Region, as well as the actual reference documents,which contain the data EPA relied upon in calculating or evaluating theHRS scores for sites in the Region. These reference documents are availableonly in the Regional dockets. They may be viewed ``by appointment only''in the appropriate Regional Docket or Superfund Branch office. Requestsfor copies may be directed to the appropriate Regional docket or SuperfundBranch.An informal written request, rather than a formal request, should be theordinary procedure for obtaining copies of any of these documents.EPA has published a statement describing what background information (resultingfrom the initial investigation of potential CERCLA sites) the Agency disclosesin response to Freedom of Information Act requests (52 FR 5578, February25, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose and Implementation of the NPL</ITAG>PurposeThe primary purpose of the NPL is stated in the legislative history ofCERCLA (Report of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, SenateReport No. 96-848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The priority lists serve primarily informational purposes, identifyingfor the States and the public those facilities and sites or other releaseswhich appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a facility or siteon the list does not in itself reflect a judgment of the activities ofits owner or operator, it does not require those persons to undertake anyaction, nor does it assign liability to any person. Subsequent governmentaction in the form of remedial actions or enforcement actions will be necessaryin order to do so, and these actions will be attended by all appropriateprocedural safeguards.</ITAG>The purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informationaland management tool. The initial identification of a site for the NPL isintended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant furtherinvestigation to assess the nature and extent of the public health andenvironmental risks associated with the site and to determine what CERCLA-financedremedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves tonotify the public of sites EPA believes warrant further investigation.Federal facility sites are eligible for the NPL pursuant to the NCP at40 CFR 300.66(c)(2). However, section 111(e)(3) of CERCLA, as amended bySARA, limits the expenditure of CERCLA monies at Federally-owned facilities.Federal facility sites are also subject to the requirements of CERCLA section120, added by SARA.Placing Sites on the NPLThere are three mechanisms for placing sites on the NPL. The principalmechanism is the application of the HRS. The HRS serves as a screeningdevice to evaluate the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substancesto cause human health or safety problems, or ecological or environmentaldamage. The HRS score is calculated by estimating risks presented in threepotential ``pathways'' of human or environmental exposure: Ground water,surface water, and air. Within each pathway of exposure, the HRS considersthree categories of factors ``that are designed to encompass most aspectsof the likelihood of exposure to a hazardous substance through a releaseand the magnitude or degree of harm from such exposure'': (1) Factors thatindicate the presence or likelihood of a release to the environment; (2)factors that indicate the nature and quantity of the substances presentingthe potential threat; and (3) factors that indicate the human or environmental``targets'' potentially at risk from the site. Factors within each of thesethree categories are assigned a numerical value according to a set scale.Once numerical values are computed for each factor, the HRS uses mathematicalformulas that reflect the relative importance and interrelationships ofthe various factors to arrive at a final site score on a scale of 0 to100. The resultant HRS score represents an estimate of the relative ``probabilityand magnitude of harm to the human population or sensitive environmentfrom exposure to hazardous substancs as a result of the contamination ofground water, surface water, or air'' (47 FR 31180, July 16, 1982). Thosesites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL.Under the second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State maydesignate a single site as its top priority, regardless of the HRS score.This mechanism is provided by section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amendedby SARA, which requires that, to the extent practicable, the NPL includewithin the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each Staterepresenting the greatest danger to public health, welfare, or the environmentamong known facilities in the State.The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(b)(4)(50 FR 37624, September 16, 1985), has been used only in rare instances.It allows certain sites with HRS scores below 28.50 to be eligible forthe NPL if all of the following occur:andbullet; The Agency for toxic Substances and Disease Registry of the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services has issued a health advisory whichrecommends dissociation of individuals from the release.andbullet; EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat topublic health.andbullet; EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use itsremedial authority than to use its removal authority to respond to therelease.All sites in this update are being included on the NPL based on HRS scores.Federal agencies have the primary responsibility under CERCLA section 120(c)for identifying Federal facility sites. In conjunction with EPA RegionalOffices, the Federal agencies perform investigations, sampling, monitoring,and scoring of sites. Regional Offices then conduct a quality control reviewof the candidate sites. EPA Headquarters conducts further quality assuranceaudits to ensure accuracy and consistency among the various offices participatingin the scoring. The Agency then proposes the sites that meet one of thethree eligibility criteria for listing (and EPA's listing policies) andsolicits public comment on the proposal. Based on these comments and furtherreview by EPA, the Agency determines final HRS scores and lists those sitesthat still qualify for the final NPL.In response to CERCLA section 105(c), as amended by SARA, EPA has proposedrevisions to the HRS (53 FR 51962, December 23, 1988). EPA intends to issuethe revised HRS as soon as possible. However, until the proposed revisionshave been subject to public comment and put into effect, EPA will continueto propose and promulgate sites using the current HRS, in accordance withCERCLA section 105(c)(1) and Congressional intent, <T3>see</T3>, e.g., S. Rep. No. 11, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 41 (1985); 131<T3>Cong. Rec.</T3> S-11681 (daily ed., Sept. 18, 1985) (statement of Sen.Baucus).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Statutory Requirements and Listing Policies</ITAG>CERCLA restricts EPA's authority to respond to certain categories of releasesof hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants by expressly excludingsome substances, such as petroleum, from the response program. In addition,CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites ``among''the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,or contaminants, and section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certainenumerated and ``other appropriate'' factors in doing so. Thus, as a matterof policy, EPA has the discretion not to use CERCLA to respond to certaintypes of releases. For example, EPA has chosen not to list sites that resultfrom contamination associated with facilities licensed by the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (NRC), on the grounds that NRC has the authority and expertiseto clean up releases from those facilities (48 FR 40661, September 8, 1983).Where other authorities exist, placing the site on the NPL for possibleremedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Therefore, EPA haschosen to defer certain types of sites from the NPL even though CERCLAmay provide authority to respond. If, however, the Agency later determinesthat sites not listed as a matter of policy are not being properly respondedto, the Agency may place them on the NPL.In the proposed revisions to the NCP (53 FR 51394, December 21, 1988),the Agency is considering extending the deferral policy, under certaincircumstances, to include other Federal authorities and States that havecorrective action authority. The Agency is also considering extending thepolicy to sites where the potentially responsible parties enter into enforcementagreements for site cleanup under CERCLA. EPA notes that even if anotherauthority is applicable to Federal facilities, the cleanup of such siteswill not be deferred, and Federal Facilities will continue to be includedin the NPL, consistent with CERCLA section 120(d)(2).Releases from Federal Facility SitesOn June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21054), the Agency announced a decision on componentsof a policy for generally deferring from listing those non-Federal sitesthat are subject to Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and RecoveryAct (RCRA). The policy was intended to reflect RCRA's broadened correctiveaction authorities as a result of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmentsof 1984 (HSWA). In announcing the RCRA policy, the Agency reserved fora later date the question of whether this or another policy would be appliedto Federal facility sites that include one or more RCRA hazardous wastemanagement units, and thus are subject to RCRA Subtitle C corrective actionauthorities. On May 13, 1987 (52 FR 17991), the Agency announced its intent to adopta policy that would allow Federal facility sites to be placed on the NPLregardless of whether RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities areapplicable.Elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>is a notice describing the policy for placingon the NPL those sites located on Federally-owned or -operated facilitiesthat meet the eligibility criteria (e.g., HRS score of 28.50 or greater)set out in the NCP for listing on the NPL, even if the Federal facilityis also subject to the corrective action authorities of RCRA Subtitle C.Thus the June 10, 1986 RCRA deferral policy (51 Fr 21057), applicable toprivate sites, will not be applied to Federal facility sites. The Agency believes that placing Federal facility sites with or withoutRCRA-regulated hazardous waste management units on the NPL is consistentwith the intent of section 120 of SARA and will serve the purposes originallyintended by the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(e)(2)_to advise the public of thestatus of Federal Government cleanup efforts (50 FR 47931, November 20,1985). In addition, listing will help other Federal agencies set prioritiesand focus cleanup efforts on those sites presenting the most serious problems.Releases from Special Study Wastes and Mining Sites Section 105(g) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires additional informationbefore sites involving RCRA ``special study wastes'' can be added to theNPL (53 FR 23992, June 24, 1988). One of the sites being expended in thisrule (Weldon Spring Quarry/Plant/Pits) involves such wastes. The same sitealso involves mining wastes, which are addressed under a SMCRA applicabilitypolicy also explained on June 24, 1988 (53 FR 23993). A memorandum hasbeen placed in the docket addressing the application of the special studywaste and SMCRA policies to this site. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Disposition of Sites in Today's Final Rule</ITAG>This final rule adds eight Federal facility sites to the Federal facilitysection of the NPL (Table I), finalizes the expansion of two Federal facilitysites already on the NPL, and reclassifies one site already on the NPLto a Federal facility site.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,i1,4,4,r150,r10,r10,r8</C><T4>Table I._National Priorities List, Federal Facility Sites, New Final(by Group) March 1989</T4><H1>NPL Gr\1\</H1><H1>St</H1><H1>Site Name</H1><H1>City/County</H1><H1>Response category \2\</H1><H1>Cleanup status \3\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>NM</D><D>Cal West Metals (USSBA)</D><D>Lemitar</D><D>D</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>AL</D><D>Anniston Army Depot (SE Ind Area)</D><D>Anniston</D><D>R</D><D>I</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7<D>IL</D><D>Savanna Army Depot Activity</D><D>Savanna</D><D>R</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9<D>PA</D><D>Letterkenny Army Depot (PDO Area)</D><D>Franklin County</D><D>R</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10<D>DE</D><D>Dover Air Force Base</D><D>Dover</D><D>R</D><D>I</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11<D>IL</D><D>Joliet Army Ammu Plant (LAP Area)</D><D>Joliet</D><D>R</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">13<D>WA </D><D>Fairchild Air Force Base (4 Areas)</D><D>Spokane County</D><D>R</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">15<D>LA</D><D>Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant</D><D>Doyline</D><D>R</D><D/></ITAG>Number of New Final Federal Facility Sites: 8.<F>\1\ Sites are placed in groups (Gr) corresponding to groups of 50 onthe final NPL. </F><F>\2\ V=Voluntary or negotiated response; R=Federal and State response;F=Federal enforcement; S=State enforcement; D=Category to be determined.</F><F>\3\  I=Implementation activity underway, one or more operable units;O=One or more operable units completed; others may be underway; C=Implementationactivity completed for all operable units.</F></ITAG>New Final SitesThe eight new Federal facility sites in today's final rule are subjectto the corrective action authorities of RCRA Subtitle C. EPA is placingthese sites on the NPL consistent with the listing policy for Federal facilities,described elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. They include six sites reproposed for the NPLon July 22, 1987 (52 FR 27643), and two sites proposed on June 24, 1988(53 FR 23988). The Agency received comments on two of the sites reproposedon July 22, 1987; no comments were received on the remaining six sites.The Agency received technical comments on the proposal to list the LetterkennyArmy Depot (Property Disposal Office Area), Franklin County, Pennsylvania,and the Anniston Army Depot (Southeast Industrial Area), Anniston, Alabama.EPA's response to these comments is discussed in the ``Support Documentfor the Revised National Priorities List_Final Federal Facility Site Update,March 1989'' which is available in the appropriate Superfund Dockets. Site ExpansionsThe Agency is finalizing two site expansions in this rule, the expansionof the Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA) site in Denver, Colorado, to includeBasin F, a 93-acre lagoon on the site, and the expansion of the WeldonSpring Quarry (USDOE/Army) site in St. Charles County, Missouri, to includethe Weldon Spring Feed Materials plant and Raffinate Pits.The approach of expanding a site to include a contiguous area that is contributingto a contamination problem, rather than proposing a second separate site,is within the Agency's authority and is consistent with past practice.For instance, in the first NPL proposal on December 30, 1982 (47 FR 58476),EPA proposed to list a 28-mile stream bed (the ``Silver Bow Creek site''),and finalized that site on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). The Agencythen proposed on June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21101) to expand the site to includean additional area which EPA determined to be significantly contributingto the contamination; the Silver Bow Creek expansion was finalized on July22, 1987 (52 FR 27627). EPA has broad authority to address contamination,as reflected in CERCLA section 104(d)(4), which allows the Agency to treatrelated, noncontiguous facilities as one for the purpose of remedial action,and in CERCLA section 101(9), which defines a ``facility'' under CERCLAto include any site or area where a hazardous substance has been placedor ``come to be located.''The Agency received comments from one party opposing the proposal to expandthe RMA site; EPA had proposed this expansion on July 22, 1987 (52 FR 27643)when the RMA site was added to the final NPL. EPA believes that it is appropriateto include Basin F in the RMA listing.Basin F is located on section 36 of the approximately 40 designated landsections at the RMA property. The RMA/NPL site, as originally listed, includesthe bulk of the Arsenal property, and indeed physically surrounds the BasinF area. EPA has identified Basin F as a major source of ground water contaminationwhich mixes with ground water contamination from other sources at the Arsenal,making coordinated response necessary. Basin F also represents a majorsource of surface contamination, although that situation is being addressedby a CERCLA interim response action at Basin F. The Agency believes thatthe site definition for RMA should be expanded to include Basin F so thatEPA will have the option of seeking a comprehensive remedy under CERCLAfor contamination at the contiguous areas of Basin F and the original RMA/NPLsite.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In the case of the Basin F expansion, a non-contiguoussite expansion analysis is not technically required. Information developedduring the course of the remedial investigation/feasibility study confirmsthat contamination extends from the original RMA/NPL site to the BasinF area. This provides an additional basis for including Basin F withinthe original NPL site at RMA, because the statute provides that a CERCLA``facility'' includes the site or area where hazardous substances have``come to be located'' (CERCLA section 101(9)). The definition of a ``site,''reflected by the original HRS listing package, is continually refined asthe CERCLA process progresses and more information on the extent of contaminationis developed.Basin F was excluded from the RMA site (as initially proposed and promulgated)because EPA believed that Basin F might be subject to RCRA Subtitle C correctiveaction authorities, and thus might be appropriate for deferral under theAgency's September 8, 1983 NPL/RCRA policy (48 FR 40662 and further discussedat 49 FR 40323-40324, 40336 (October 15, 1984)). EPA subsequently learnedthat Basin F should not, in fact, have been deferred to RCRA based on thepolicy in effect when RMA was proposed for lising.\2\<NOTE/> Rather, it should have been included in the original RMAsite under the 1983 policy.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Basin F stopped receiving RCRA hazardous wastes priorto July 26, 1982 (the effective date of the land disposal regulations)and did not certify closure prior to January 26, 1983; thus, it was notsubject to RCRA corrective action requirements available at that time,and qualified as a ``non-regulated unit.'' It was not appropriate for deferralto RCRA under the September 1983 policy.Basin F also qualifies for listing under the current policy. Passage ofHSWA in 1984 gave the Agency additional authorities under RCRA to ordercorrective action at all units at a RCRA facility, including those thatwere known as ``non-regulated'' units; thus, on June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21057),the Agency announced a revised NPL/RCRA policy which provided for the deferralfrom listing of certain RCRA sites where corrective action authoritiesare available (again, including sites with non-regulated units). However,that revised policy applied only to <T3>non</T3>-Federal facility sites, and thus not to Basin F. Thus, theJune 1986 revised policy did not supersede the September 1983 RCRA listingpolicy <T3>with respect to</T3> Federal facilities. On May 13, 1987 (52 FR 17991-17993),the Agency asked for comment on a policy for listing Federal sites regardlessof RCRA applicability, and on July 22, 1987 (52 FR 27645-27646), the Agencydiscussed that policy with specific application to Basin F. Elsewhere intoday's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Agency formally announced its policy oflisting Federal facility sites on the NPL, even if they are also subjectto RCRA authorities, as generally discussed in the May and July 1987 notices.Thus, Basin F is appropriate for inclusion in the NPL site under currentAgency policy. Further specific comments concerning the expansion of the RMA site arediscussed in the Support Document for this rule, which is available inthe Superfund docket. The second Federal facility site being expanded in this rule is the WeldonSpring Quarry (USDOE/Army), St. Charles County, Missouri. It was placedon the final NPL on July 22, 1987 (52 FR 27620). On June 24, 1988, EPAproposed to expand the site to include the Weldon Spring Feed MaterialsPlant and Raffinate Pits, which are located less than 3 miles from theQuarry and are linked to the contamination at the original site. The sitecontains mining wastes from uranium ore processing; an addendum discussingspecial study wastes at the site is included in the Superfund dockets.In addition, the site was abandoned prior to the August 3, 1977 enactmentof the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (``SMCRA'').Consistent with the policy for listing SMCRA sites on the NPL, a statementcovering SMCRA applicability at the site is included in the dockets. Nocomments were received on the proposed expansion of this site, or on thespecial study waste and SMCRA addenda. The expanded site is now being placedon the final NPL under the name ``Weldon Spring Quarry/Plant/Pits (USDOE/Army)''.Site Reclassification Finally, this rule reclassifies one site_W. R. Grace Co., Inc. (Wayne Plant),Wayne, New Jersey_as a Federal facility site; that site had been proposedfor the NPL on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40674). W.R. Grace Co., Inc., boughtthe facility in 1957 and owned it until September 18, 1984, when the facilitywas acquired by the U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE). USDOE changed thename of the site to the Wayne Interim Storage Site (WISS). On September21, 1984 (49 FR 37070), the site was placed on the final NPL under itsoriginal name. The site will now be included in the Federal facility sectionof the NPL. The site name is being changed to ``W. R. Grace andamp; Co.,Inc./Wayne Interim Storage Site (USDOE)'' to more accurately reflect theownership and status of the site.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Contents of the NPL </ITAG>The eight new sites added to the NPL in today's rule (Table 1) and theone reclassified site have been incorporated into the Federal section ofthe NPL by their group number. Sites on the NPL are arranged accordingto their HRS scores and presented in groups of 50 sites to emphasize thatminor differences in HRS scores do not necessarily represent significantlydifferent levels of risk. EPA considers the sites within a group to haveapproximately the same priority for response actions. The Federal facilitysection appears at the end of this final rule, and will be codified aspart of Appendix B to the NCP. Each entry on the NPL contains the name of the facility and the State andcity or county in which it is located. For informational purposes, eachentry is accompanied by one or more notations reflecting the status ofresponse and cleanup activities at these sites at the time this list wasprepared. Because this information may change periodically, these notationsmay become outdated.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis</ITAG>The costs of cleanup actions that may be taken at sites are not directlyattributable to placement on the NPL, as explained below. Therefore, theAgency has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``major'' regulationunder Executive Order 12291. EPA has conducted a preliminary analysis ofeconomic implications of today's amendment to the NCP. EPA believes thatthe kinds of economic effects associated with this revision are generallysimilar to those effects identified in the regulatory impact analysis (RIA)prepared in 1982 for the revisions to the NCP pursuant to section 105 ofCERCLA and the economic analysis prepared when amendments to the NCP wereproposed (50 FR 5882, February 12, 1985). The Agency believes the anticipatedeconomic effects related to adding eight sites to the NPL can be characterizedin terms of the conclusions of the earlier RIA and the most recent economicanalysis. This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budgetfor review as required by Executive Order 12291.CostsEPA has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``major'' regulation underExecutive Order 12291 because inclusion of a site on the NPL does not itselfimpose any costs. It does not establish that EPA will necessarily undertakeremedial action, nor does it require any action by a private party or determineits liability for site response costs. Costs that arise out of site responsesresult from site-by-site decisions about what actions to take, not directlyfrom the act of listing itself. In addition, all sites in this final ruleare Federally-owned or -operated, and CERCLA section 111(e)(3) prohibitsuse of the Trust Fund for remedial actions at Federal facilities.BenefitsThe real benefits associated with today's amendment placing additionalsites on the NPL are increased health and environmental protection as aresult of increased public awareness of potential hazards.As a result of the additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower humanexposure to high-risk chemicals, and higher-quality surface water, groundwater, soil, and air. These benefits are expected to be significant, althoughdifficult to estimate in advance of the remedial investigation/feasibilitystudy of each site. Associated with the costs are significant potentialbenefits and cost offsets. The distributional costs of carrying out remediesat sites on the NPL have corresponding ``benefits'' in that funds expendedfor a response generate employment, directly or indirectly (through purchasedmaterials).<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires EPA to review the impactsof this action on small entities, or certify that the action will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. By smallentities, the Act refers to small businesses, small government jurisdictions,and nonprofit organizations.While modifications to the NPL are considered revisions to the NCP, theyare not typical regulatory changes since the revisions do not automaticallyimpose costs. The placing of sites on the NPL does not in itself requireany action of any party, (e.g., contractors operating government-ownedfacilities), nor does it determine the liability of any party for the costof cleanup at the site. Further, because this final rule involves Federally-ownedor -operated facilities, the number of small entities that could be affectedwill be small.The impacts (from cost recovery) on small governments and nonprofit organizationswould be determined on a similar case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 300</ITAG>Air pollution control, Chemicals, Hazardous materials, Intergovernmentalrelations, Natural resources, Oil pollution, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Superfund, Waste treatment and disposal, Water pollutioncontrol, Water supply.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan Z.
