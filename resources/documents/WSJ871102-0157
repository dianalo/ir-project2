Leave it to the residents of Derby Line Village, Vt., to come up with a proper Yankee solution: Sell it.    Every fall for almost two decades, the road crew in the tiny Canadian-border community of 874 has swept up millions of dead leaves, packed them into bales and marketed them as a hot commodity. &quot;We've got to rake them anyways,&quot; says Ben Blaif, a village trustee. &quot;If someone wants to buy them, why not?&quot;    One would think the residents of the tree-studded state might have enough leaves of their own. But Alphonse Patenaude, a village road-crew employee, says that usually Derby Line can't keep up with the demand. This season, the village has already sold 400 bales -- each measuring about 18 by 18 by 40 inches and weighing 70 pounds -- to people who came from as far as 25 miles away.    Though some leaves still remain, a few customers had to be sent home empty-handed. Mr. Patenaude says one disappointed woman put in an order for a share in next year's harvest. And the village does it all without advertising. The leaves, Mr. Patenaude says, &quot;sell themselves.&quot;    Derby Line isn't exactly raking in a fortune from the venture. Bales sell for only 40 cents apiece, and the village rents the baler from a local farmer for $150. Based on this year's estimated sale of 410 bales, Derby Line should net a whopping $14.    Nevertheless, village officials insist that selling the leaves is good for everyone. It's good for Derby Line because the leaves don't clog the water lines and sewers. And it's good for the local residents, who use them as mulch for their gardens or pile them against their homes for insulation. Mr. Blaif himself buys 20 bales each year for his raspberry patch.    Evidently, however, the idea hasn't swept the Northeast. Bangor, Maine, for example, also has an ample supply of fallen leaves, but it isn't interested in selling them. The town's public-works department simply hauls them to the city dump, from which anyone can take them free of charge.    &quot;I would think people would have enough leaves without buying them,&quot; says Robert Breau, an employee of the Bangor public-works department. &quot;Seems a little far-fetched to me.&quot; He adds, though, that Bangor does peddle its own local commodity: sludge from the waste-treatment plant, a bargain at $5 a cubic yard. </TEXT></DOC>
