(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The man who saved a Detroit Zoochimpanzee from drowning said he never feared for his own life ashe wrestled the 135-pound primate.   ``He was looking at me,'' said Rick Swope, a 33-year-old truckdriver from Cement City. ``I think he knew that I was helpinghim,'' so Swope said he wasn't afraid.   Swope was visiting the zoo Sunday with his wife, Cynthia, andtheir three children.   ``We watched the chimpanzees for probably about half an hour orso and we were just getting ready to go when I heard a splash,'' hesaid. ``I just caught out of the corner of my eye this chimpanzeeflying through the air.''   ``Everyone in the whole place was just standing around watchingthis monkey drown,'' Swope said Monday. ``When he went down thesecond time I knew I had to do something.''   Swope scaled the 4-foot fence and plunged into the cold, murkywater. He reached the chimpanzee and pulled it back to the island.   ``He was pretty lifeless,'' Swope said. ``When I brought him outof there I wasn't sure he was still alive.''   Zoo officials are unsure why the 18-year-old, 135-pound malechimpanzee jumped into the moat surrounding its 1-acre island home,said spokeswoman Pat Butkiewicz. Chimpanzees cannot swim andgenerally are afraid of water.   In April, a week after the $7.5 million exhibit opened, a20-year-old female chimp drowned in the 5-foot-deep moat.   Zoo director Steve Graham said the exhibit would be partiallyclosed while the design of the moat was being re-evaluated.   Graham said Swope's rescue was brave but reckless, becausechimps are three to five times stronger than humans. A zoo employeewas trying to use a pole to save the chimp when Swope jumped in thewater, officials said.   Swope, who doesn't have any lifeguard or veterinary training,said he kept one arm around the chimp's stomach during the rescue.   ``I thought maybe I could pump some water out of him,'' he said.``When he got his strength back, I let him go.''   Swope's family each year visits the suburban Detroit zoo about75 miles northwest of their home. He said chimpanzee exhibit is oneof his children's favorites.   ``They're happy it turned out the way it did, too. They're gladI went in and got him,'' he said. ``They wouldn't expect anythingless from their dad.''</TEXT></DOC>
