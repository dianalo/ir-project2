Japan's institutional investors sharply curtailed theirusual bidding at the U.S. Treasury's $32.25 billion quarterlysecurities auction last week, acquiring only a fraction ofthe U.S. government debt they usually buy. Analysts warn thatif this trend continues, U.S. long-term interest rates aren'tlikely to fall significantly, despite a slowing economy,because the Treasury will be forced to offer fatter yields tolure the Japanese back or attract other investors.</LP><TEXT>   At Thursday's sale of 30-year Treasury bonds, the finalsegment of the three-part auction, Japanese investorspurchased between only 5% and 15% of the $10.26 billion ofbonds sold. That was down sharply from as much as 50% at someprevious 30-year bond auctions. It's a trend that analystsand Japanese investors expect to persist.   &quot;The Japanese have got all the dollars they need,&quot; saidRobert Alan Feldman, an economist with Salomon Brothers Inc.in Tokyo. Besides, added Koichi Torihara, an internationalinvestment manager at DaiIchi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the world'slargest bank: &quot;It's not the right time to do long-terminvestments.&quot;   The implications of Japan's waning hunger for Treasurysecurities are important for the U.S. Without big Japaneseinterest, &quot;the bonds have to be bought by domesticinvestors,&quot; said Scott Pardee, chairman of the U.S.subsidiary of Yamaichi Securities Co. in New York. And now,U.S. investors are demanding higher rates to compensate forexpectations of rising inflation, especially since oil pricesbegan soaring after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.   Furthermore, a big problem is that Americans don't saveenough to finance the federal budget deficit and U.S.industry's needs. Analysts estimate the shortfall to be about$100 billion. If foreigners don't pony up the difference,U.S. long-term rates will have to rise sufficiently toattract U.S. and foreign investors.   &quot;To the extent that our savings can't cover our fiscaldeficit, the savings and loan bailout, the state budgetdeficits and the legitimate needs of U.S. industry, then ourrates are going to have to go up,&quot; said Mr. Pardee.   Analysts say that's what happened at Wednesday's $11.5billion auction of 10-year Treasury notes. The average yieldon the securities was set at 8.77%. But because there wasn'tenough demand at that yield, the Treasury was forced toaccept bids as high as 8.84% to unload its notes.   Higher interest rates just now could be bad news for afaltering U.S. economy already faced with the prospect ofhigher oil prices and slowing growth. If the cost of moneyrises, said Salomon's Mr. Feldman, &quot;it will make it that muchharder to get the U.S. economy back on its feet.&quot; It wouldalso bloat an already huge federal budget deficit.   Even government officials in Japan are aware of thehazards for the U.S. but say there is nothing they can do.&quot;It's early to draw any conclusions,&quot; said Makoto Utsumi,Japan's vice minister of finance for international affairs.&quot;But it's clearly very, very bad timing.&quot;   The main factor sapping Japanese interest in U.S. Treasurysecurities is fear of the unknown. Japanese investors see noreason to keep stocking up on U.S. debt when they see U.S.military forces in a standoff with Iraq in the Middle East,the U.S. economy slowing down and little difference betweenU.S. and Japanese interest rates. Moreover, there's awidespread belief in Tokyo that the dollar soon will weaken.&quot;The visibility is almost zero for investors,&quot; said Mr.Utsumi. &quot;They can't have any clear perspective.&quot;   Japanese investors are equally blunt. &quot;It's not good senseto buy U.S. Treasurys,&quot; said Hideaki Nishisaka, a manager atDaido Mutual Life Insurance Co., which has $20 billion inassets. The company has trimmed its holdings of U.S. Treasurybonds to about two-thirds the amount it would consider a fullload, he said.   Japanese investors' declining appetite for U.S. Treasurysisn't altogether new. In the first quarter, the latest forwhich data is available, they sold a net $3.9 billion of U.S.government securities. Last week's auction continued &quot;a trendthat we've seen all year,&quot; said William M. Brachfeld, anexecutive vice president at the U.S. unit of Daiwa SecuritiesCo. in New York. &quot;There are many {Japanese} who speculate,who come in and out all the time. But in terms of investors,someone who sticks and stays there, you're not seeing that.&quot;   Japanese investors haven't shunned all foreign bonds.Yamaichi's Mr. Pardee said these investors have beenattracted to West German government bonds. One reason is thatGerman bond yields equal those in the U.S., while Germaninflation is lower and its currency is expected to remainstrong. And while higher oil prices will boost Germaninflation as well as America's, Mr. Pardee said Germany has abetter record in controlling prices.   The waning Japanese appetite for U.S. government debt isevident everywhere. Before Thursday's auction of 30-year U.S.Treasury bonds, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank already had decided tosit out the auction, even though it can borrow dollars andavoid the foreign-exchange risk of owning dollar-denominatedbonds that other, yen-based, investors might face.   At Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co., with more than $100billion in assets, the international investment division wason holiday last week, in the midst of a record U.S. debtauction. The insurer isn't related to Dai-Ichi Kangyo.   &quot;The problems in the Middle East hurt interest&quot; at theU.S. Treasury sale, said Aaron Cohen, a senior analyst atDaiwa Securities Co. With U.S. troops poised to challengeIraq's invasion of Kuwait, the prospect of a major regionalconflict is real. In the past, the U.S. was considered a safehaven for international money in times of crisis. But today,investors in Japan say, the Japanese economy is betterpositioned to weather higher oil prices than the U.S.economy. Because investors in Japan already hold largeamounts of U.S. government debt, they don't want to add totheir risk by buying more.   And though the recent Mideast tensions have driven thedollar higher, institutional investors don't expect the U.S.currency's strength to last. They cite the troubled outlookfor the U.S. economy and, in a bit of circular logic, theirwaning interest in buying dollar-denominated U.S. Treasurys.&quot;Looking ahead, we expect the dollar to go back down by thelast quarter of the year,&quot; said Mr. Cohen.   The possibility of foreign-exchange losses for yen-basedinvestors who buy dollar-denominated bonds makes theever-narrower difference between the yields on Japanese andU.S. government bonds seem insignificant. At the end oftrading in Tokyo Friday, the No. 119 benchmark 10-yearJapanese government bond yielded 7.98%, or 7.37% whencalculated on a semiannual compound yield basis. Thatcompares with a semiannual compound yield of 8.67% for10-year U.S. Treasurys.   Even if Japanese life insurance companies didn't foreseerisks in increasing their U.S. Treasury holdings, manycouldn't afford to. Kozo Nishimoto, a managing director atMeiji Mutual Life Insurance Co., notes that asset growth atthe company, with $66 billion in assets, is slowing. Lastyear, the growth was only 85% of what it was the yearpreviously. &quot;We cannot increase our investments like we didbefore,&quot; he said.   Aware of the drawbacks many Japanese investors see, thebig Japanese securities houses didn't push their clients toinvest in U.S. bonds at last week's auction, some securitiesdealers say. &quot;There wasn't much evidence of interest, and wecan't create it,&quot; said one dealer.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Prices of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds ended unchanged tomoderately lower as one of the market's most volatile weeksin recent years drew to a close.   For the entire week, the Treasury market postedsignificant losses with the price of the benchmark 30-yearbond falling about 2 1/2 points, or about $25 for a bond witha $1,000 face amount, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.   During Friday's session, bond prices gyrated wildly. Bondsrose during early trading on news that the producer priceindex, a measure of inflation on the wholesale level, fellmodestly in July. Bond prices then plunged more than onepoint as traders tried to clear out some of the inventorythey accumulated during last week's Treasury refunding.   Menacing talk from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and someconfident comments from President Bush contributed toFriday's volatility.   Late in the day, bonds bounced off their lows onbargain-hunting and ended as much as about 3/8 point lower.The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 99 21/32, downfrom 100 2/32 on Thursday. The yield rose to 8.77% from8.75%.   In the corporate market, junk bonds languished. Most junkbonds, speculative-grade securities with low or no creditratings, finished 1/4 to 1/2 point lower.   Among leading losers were the junk bonds of casinosoperated by real estate developer Donald Trump. Trump CastleFunding Corp.'s 13 3/4% first mortgage bonds slipped 1/2point to 49 1/2, while Trump Taj Mahal Funding Corp.'s 14%securities fell one point to 41 1/2.   An article in Friday's edition of The Wall Street Journalreported that Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. quit work on restructuring$1.3 billion of Trump's casino bond debt.   ---   Michael R.
