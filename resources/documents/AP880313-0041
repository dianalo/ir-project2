Such a call was made in a leaflet circulated in theIsraeli-occupied territory and prompted expressions of concern fromJordanian Prime Minister Zaid Rifai.   But the senior PLO official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, disassociated the organization from the contents of theleaflet, saying it was an adulterated version.   The official said the leaflet was part of ``a plot meant to harmour relationship with the Jordanian government.''   In a leaflet issued Thursday and circulated in the occupiedareas, underground Palestinian leaders said Arabs should takerevenge ``on collaborators and the lackeys of the Jordanianregime.'' It purported to be signed by the PLO.   It also called on West Bank deputies in Jordan's Parliament toresign and ``return to our people, otherwise they will have noplace in our land.''   Delegates of the lower house of Parliament, half of whose 60members are from the West Bank, refused to comment on the call,saying ``it is untrue and fabricated.''   State-run radio said Rifai denounced the resignation call,saying ``it harms the unity of the two peoples in the two banks ... and only serves the enemy objectives.''   It said the PLO provided Rifai with ``the real text of thestatement, which does not include such a suspicious call.''   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle Eastwar but deputies from the West Bank continue to sit in theJordanian Parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
