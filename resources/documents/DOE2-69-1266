Previously, a pilotwaterflood project in the Tor Formation led to approval in 1983 of fullscale water injection in the Tor Formation. The pilot project consistedof one injector and three producers in an unconfined four spot pattern.As of May 1988, a total of 10 million barrels of water had been injectedover a 22 month period. Results have been favorable and have been utilizedto justify expansion of the waterflood to the Lower Ekofisk Formation.Factors which were taken into consideration during the analysis includelack of both vertical and horizontal confinement, significant initialgas saturation, influence of gas injection, regional permeability variations,anisotropy and layering effects. Three dimensional simulation resultsare included which tie all the parameters together and form the basisfor extrapolating results to full field.</TEXT></DOC>
