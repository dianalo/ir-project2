The award went to four West Virginia plaintiffs whosaid they'd suffered peeling paint and eye irritation fromAshland's refinery across the Big Sandy River in Kentucky.   Politesse prevents the courts from exploring the truenature of such cases, but we're sure Mr. Jackson would bewell rewarded for his eloquence. Under the typicalcontingency-fee arrangement, a successful lawyer pockets athird of the judgment, or in this case more than $3 million.And Mr. Jackson was only getting started; the four plaintiffswere selected by lot from a list of more than 200 andgrowing. At $2.5 million a plaintiff, Ashland could have beenout billions.   At least in West Virginia, however, times have changed.The verdict was handed down in May 1990; this month thestate's Supreme Court invalidated the damage award in Arnoldtv. Ashland Oil. We may be seeing the first chink in the armorof the organized bar. Tort liability reform may yet be beateninto lawyers by the one group in the country that can speakover their heads -- the judges.   The case against Ashland Oil had everything -- anout-of-state defendant, in-state plaintiffs and thepolitically correct claim of pollution -- except evidence ofany harm. Ashland's refinery met all federal Clean Air Actstandards. There was little scientific evidence to supporteven the minor allegations of harm. The plaintiffs didn'teven try to prove any tangible loss in property values.   The state Supreme Court gave a dozen reasons to reverse,starting with the common-sense requirement that there must besome material harm before there can be any liability. Thetrial judge also erred by failing to tell the jury that somereasonable amount of pollution was unavoidable.   Perhaps most importantly, the court held that punitivedamages could not be awarded &quot;because appellees did notintroduce evidence which demonstrated a specific intent tocause bodily harm or injury.&quot; No ill motive, no message tosend to any corporate board rooms, no punitives.   This follows another West Virginia opinion this monthinterpreting the latest U.S. Supreme Court decision on whenthe Due Process clause prohibits punitive damages. WestVirginia Justice Richard Neely ruled there could not bepunitives in a case where the jury agreed there was no actualharm to the plaintiffs. He set out a tough new set ofinstructions for juries, including the requirement of some&quot;reasonable relationship&quot; between the actual harm and anypunitives.   This new toughness from the judiciary will bedisappointing news to the lawyers, but it's excellent newsfor West Virginia. Businesses looking for likely places torelocate have good reason to consider a state whose judgeshave so clearly said they've had enough of punitive damagesand the sue-'em-til-it-hurts mentality.   Everyone agrees that people who are truly harmed deservetheir day in court. If a defendant clearly intended to harmsomeone, there's even a good case for punitive damages. Bynow, however, the American civil justice system has aworld-wide reputation for arbitrary multimillion-dollarverdicts. With West Virginia leading the way, maybe thiscountry can lose this distinction sooner rather than later.</TEXT></DOC>
