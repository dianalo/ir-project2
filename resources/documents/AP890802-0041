The Soviet Union, now strengthening its ties with Iran, readilyagreed to the U.S. request for help. Arab governments andSwitzerland also were enlisted Tuesday in the U.S. diplomaticcampaign to get through to pro-Iranian factions that hold theAmericans captive.   The hostages' status appeared to be newly imperiled after Shiiteextremists claimed Monday to have hanged U.S. Marine Lt. Col.William R. Higgins in retaliation for Israel's refusal to free acleric it accuses of involvement in terrorist actions, includingHiggins' kidnapping last year.   Israel's offer to swap Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and two othercaptives for all foreign hostages, including three Israelis, wasspurned by the militant organization known as Hezbollah.   Officials said the United States sent a strongly worded messageto nations in the Middle East _ including Iran _ on behalf of thehostages. ``We expect those who have influence over the hostagetakers to exert that influence,'' said one official, who spoke oncondition he not be identified.   While no pressure was brought to bear on Israel _ and no demandsmade for the release of the cleric _ the Bush administration isurging Israeli leaders not to take any action that might threatenthe other eight American hostages, diplomatic sources said lateTuesday.   In a series of fast-paced meetings with leaders of the Israeligovernment in Jerusalem, American Ambassador William Brown askedthat Washington be kept informed of Israel's actions in the future,said U.S. officials and diplomatic sources who demanded anonymity.   Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze tookwith him on a previously scheduled trip to Tehran a U.S. appealthat he urge Iran to arrange the release of the American hostagesin Lebanon.   In Moscow, the Soviets denounced as ``inhuman'' the reportedexecution of Higgins, but also said Israel had aggravated thesituation by abducting the sheik and registered concern over ``anescalation of acts of violence and terror.''   Still, Bush administration officials hoped Moscow might beinfluential with Iran on the hostages. The Soviets were approachedwhile Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Shevardnadzeattended a conference on Cambodia last weekend in Paris.   And in Stockholm, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kellysaid he asked Soviet diplomat Nicolai Kozyrev at a meeting Tuesdayon Afghanistan that Moscow ``use its good offices to influence theIranian government to bring about their (the hostages') safe andimmediate release.''   U.S. military retaliation, as an option, was raised at the WhiteHouse. An administration source said Tuesday it was ``in the realmof the possible.''   Apart from other considerations, though, the fact that thehostages' captors shuttle them frequently from house to house inLebanon and live among women and children in slums and camps makestargeting the captors difficult.   The immediate concern, U.S. and other diplomatic sources said,was Joseph J. Cicippio, a 58-year-old comptroller of the AmericanUniversity of Beirut whose execution was threatened for Tuesday,then put off.   Intrigued by the reprieve, U.S. officials left open thepossibility it was prompted by Iranian intervention.   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said theUnited States had not asked Israel to release Obeid.   She cited U.S. policy against dealing with or making concessionsto terrorists.   ``No, we have not because you know our longstanding policy onhostages, and Israel understands the U.S. policy on the matter ofhostages,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.</TEXT></DOC>
