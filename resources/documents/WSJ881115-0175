In 1985, before any congressional action was taken, I launched two programs: one to foster resident management of public-housing projects and another to foster the sale of projects to residents.    HUD has provided $3 million to resident groups to develop management skills at projects across the country. Another $2.5 million will be awarded this year. These grants are catalysts to transform energetic, interested public-housing residents into capable property managers. In Greenville, N.C., 17 residents have taken and passed the national certification exam for public-housing managers. In Cincinnati, residents have been trained in construction and business skills. They now contract with the housing authority to renovate vacant apartments in their project.    Our efforts to promote resident ownership of public housing have reaped great rewards for low-income families. When HUD began the home-ownership demonstration in 1985, our goal was to sell public-housing projects of all types -- large apartment buildings, triplex and duplex homes, row houses and detached single-family dwellings -- in cities across the country. By the end of this year, we expect to have completed sales in 14 cities. These sales transfer public housing directly to the residents or to a cooperative owned by residents at prices geared to be affordable to low-income renters. This program is succeeding in places as diverse as Los Angeles County, Reading, Pa., and rural St. Mary's County, Md. Before the year's end, families in Paterson, N.J., Nashville, Tenn., and Denver will join the ranks of public-housing homeowners. Mortgage amounts have ranged from $10,000 to $40,000 a home.    In 1987, Congress built on the example of these HUD demonstrations by passing legislation to encourage more resident managers and permitting resident management groups to replace the local government as landlord as an interim step to selling projects to resident cooperatives. This is what took place on Oct. 25 at the Kenilworth-Parkside project in Washington, D.C. The residents will rent from a corporation that they own. If all goes according to the plan approved by HUD, after five years the property will be converted into a co-op. This is just a variation on the pattern followed in HUD's program since 1985 of selling immediately to residents.    In the U.S., home-ownership has always meant a sense of dignity for families and stability for neighborhoods. During my tenure, HUD has worked hard to extend the dream of home-ownership to low-income families as a means to better their lives and to bring a sense of community and order to public housing.    The Wall Street Journal's assertion that we tried to &quot;scuttle&quot; the sale of public housing to resident families is not correct. Indeed, the efforts we began in 1985 to help public-housing families manage their own projects and to buy their homes set an example for the 1987 legislation. By the end of the Reagan administration, hundreds of new homeowners will benefit from our leadership of this initiative.    Samuel R.
