The laser maker said the new application for the laser involves a procedure in which laser light that destroys urinary stones is conducted through fiber-optic tubes that are inserted through a small incision. The laser formerly was approved only for nonsurgical removal of bladder stones through a fiber-optic tube inserted through the urethra.    Candela said about 80 of its urology lasers have been sold. The machines are priced at more than $200,000 each. </TEXT></DOC>
