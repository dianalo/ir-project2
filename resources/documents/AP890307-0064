The airline has cancelled virtually all of its flights becausefew pilots have crossed the picket lines set up by machinistsbeginning at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.   Bush spoke as congressional Democrats pressed for action by theWhite House to stop the strike. ``I still feel that the best answeris a head on head, man to man negotiation between the union and theairline,'' the president said.   The president said a government-imposed settlement could causethe airline to shut down totally. Bush refused to invoke a 60-daydelay that could have blocked the walkout temporarily.   The strikers had threatened to set up picket lines to disruptrail and other transportation. Bush said he would urge Congress toact if that happened. He said it isn't fair for a rail commuter onLong Island to be caught up an an airline strike.   As for the poilots' slowdown on other airlines, Bush said herecognized their concerns about safety during the Eastern walkout,but told them they should not make ``the innocent traveling public apawn in this dispute.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
