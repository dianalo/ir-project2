 It reportsnoise, poor levels of transmission, dead trunks and other problems thatinterfere with service.andM;NetWatch is comprised of four main subsystems.andP;  A report mode gives youaccess to 16 management reports.andP;  The TMS (Transmission Measurement Set)function allows access to frequency, level, noise and signalling state for aspecified line.andP;  The chart function captures and logs events monitored by thesystem for subsequent review at your leisure.andP;  And a setup routine walks youthrough the programming process.andM;The system can be configured for different applications.andP;  For example, asecond generation system called DataWatch, provides all the basics ofNetWatch, plus the monitoring of dial-up and dedicated data lines.andP;  Othernetwork configurations include T-OneWatch, VoltWatch and FaxWatch.andM;NetWatch uses a high impedance bridge for scanning circuits which makes thesystem totally non-invasive.andP;  Which means, of course, that you will neverhave to take a circuit out-of-service to test, you won't increase your loadon usage-sensitive circuits and NetWatch will never interfere with existingnetwork operations.andM;Based upon system configuration, prices range from $4,500 to $20,000 for afull-figured NetWatch.andM;WalkerandM;Easy to use and easy to carry, Walker's (Ringgold, GA) WTS-201 buttset comeswith a full set of features to meet installation, repair and line testingrequirements.andM;Best suited for in-plant testing purposes, the 201 works with threeinterchangeable cordsets: one with two-way alligator clips;

 They're simple tools thatbasically just allow the lineman to access a line and dial a number.andP;  Theywill indicate polarity and some, not all, will have a tone/pulse option, butwon't come with all the niceties and durability of a high-end model.andM;Such high-end models, like Harris' TS-22, harbor all the qualities thatensure reliability over a long period, as well as little extras that make thetech's job easier.andP;  Some things to look for when buying a buttset:andM;* tone and pulse operation;andM;* speed dialing and last number redial;andM;* polarity, indication LEDs;andM;* built-in speaker/amplifier which keeps the tech's hands free;andM;* locking mute which drowns out background noise without the need to holddown a button;andM;* ergonomical design which means the set can comfortably rest between theuser's neck and shoulder without sliding off;andM;* durability, which includes weather resistance (like waterproofing) and theability to withstand the rigors of the environment (such as being dropped 20feet onto the hard, concrete ground);andM;* belt clip;andM;* meets BOC standards which ensure that the set is of the highest quality;andM;* and, of course, even more durability and reliability.andM;They just want the sets to work when they're up on a pole.andP;  and if the setsdo break, it's important to be able to get them serviced and back to thetechs quickly.andM;Leviton's Wire Test SetsandM;Two new testing products have been added to Leviton Telecom's (Bothell, WA)line of communications wiring products.andM;The Inductive Speaker Probe ($55) detects and identifies tones or signalsused for tracing wire.andP;  It enables the user to quickly identify single wirepairs or cables within a bundle.andP;  ne signal is detected through induction.andO;There's no need to strip or damage the insulation for testing.andP;  Tabs areprovided for connecting a buttset directly to the Speaker Probe.andM;The Tone Test Set ($29.50) is an ideal source for generating the trace tonesfor the Speaker Probe.andP;  The Tone Test Set generates either a constant 1,000Hz or alternating 500/1,000 Hz tone, selected by the user.andM;It also provides continuity testing, tip and ring identification and positiveline identification.andP;  Heavy duty 6A type alligator clips and a six-positionmodular plug make for reliable, versatile connections.andM;Both test sets are powered by a standard 9V battery (included).andP;  Optionalleather carrying cases are also available.andP;
