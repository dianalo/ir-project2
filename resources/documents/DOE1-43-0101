<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-0101 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method to determine calibration characteristics of electromagnetic flowmetersused in NPP sodium circuits is suggested. Nonlinearity and temperaturedependence of the flowmeter indications are studied, using as an examplethe IRMU-300 sectional transducers of the BN-600 reactor (internal diameterof the pipeline is 300 mm, longitudinal size of a magnet pole plate is1.2 D, transducer mass is 150 kg). Approximated dependence, permittingto calculate calibration characteristics of the flowmeter for any temperatureof sodium, is obtained. The fact that the calibration can be realizedaccording to measurement data for 3-4 modes in case of a shutdown reactor(the range of coolant flow rates Q=500-1000 m/sup 3//h, sodium temperatureT=180-250 deg C) and for one mode, corresponding to the plant operationwith a nominal capacity (Q1000 m/sup 3//h, T=310-320 deg C), is consideredto be one of the main advantage of the suggested relation. It decreasesby several fold the total duration of the flowmeter calibration (testing)program.</TEXT></DOC>
