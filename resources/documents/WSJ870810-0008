Shares Post Big Gains to EscapeNarrow Range That Followed Public Offering---By Randall Smith</HL><DD> 08/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TIFHEARD ON THE STREET (HRD)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN><TEXT>   Some institutional investors are wary of new stock issues by companies that have been through leveraged buyouts, known as &quot;reverse LBOs.&quot; They figure management must have squeezed out all the juice already.    The stock of Tiffany andamp; Co., a 1984 leveraged buyout, certainly acted wrung-out in the first 2 1/2 months after it went public again May 5 at 23. Its shares moved listlessly in a range of 21 to 23 3/8 until July 16. But then the stock began a strong advance that peaked at 30 3/4 last week. And there are signs of an earnings upturn that would justify Tiffany's rise.    &quot;That's been the history of reverse LBOs -- skepticism followed by re-evaluation,&quot; says retailing analyst Robert Raiff of C.J. Lawrence. &quot;There may be skepticism about how the financials have been rearranged, and just plain jealousy&quot; of the way buyout investors originally bought stock in the company at a pittance.    In this case, they had every right to be jealous. Tiffany management paid an average of only 67 cents a share.    Avon Products sold Tiffany for $135.5 million to a group led by William Chaney, Avon's president from 1977 to 1983. The price was less than the total that Avon, which bought Tiffany in 1979, had paid for and invested in the retailer of jewelry and other fancy gifts.    Mr. Chaney's main backer in the purchase was Investcorp, a unit of Bahrain-based Arabian Investment Banking Corp. The Mideast bank, founded in 1982 by Nemir Kirdar, a former employee of Chase Manhattan, represents investors from countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar.    To finance the purchase, the Arab bank put up $95.5 million in loans, and also bought Tiffany's Fifth Avenue building in New York, in a $48 million sale-leaseback. The bank also put up $8.9 million, or $1.41 a share, for 80% of the stock. The management group paid just $1 million for 20%.    Much of the debt was later refinanced by General Electric Credit, which wound up with 26% of Tiffany's common before the May sale. After the offering, Tiffany had reduced its long-term debt to $8.6 million. Investcorp still held 23%, G.E. Credit 15%, and Mr. Chaney 3.2%.    With the dust having settled, a company originally sold for $135.5 million now has an equity market value of $246.8 million. Counting remaining debt, that's an 89% increase -- nice, but hardly shocking considering that the overall stock market has doubled in the same period.    Analysts and money managers say an improving earnings outlook is the most obvious reason for the stock's recent run-up. Tiffany earned $1.01 pro forma for the year ended Jan. 31. At &quot;road shows&quot; before the stock offering, the talk was that it might have earnings growth of 15% to 25% this year, according to William A. Shutzer, an investment banker at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the lead underwriter.    But the &quot;quiet period&quot; barring stock promotion within 90 days of an offering has just expired, and analysts now see bigger gains ahead for Tiffany. Shearson analyst Stacy Ruchlamer estimates Tiffany will earn $1.45 a share this year. Janet Kloppenburg of Robertson, Colman andamp; Stephens projects $1.47 a share. Their estimates for next year are $1.85 and $1.90, respectively.    Richard Chilton, a portfolio manager of Alliance Capital Management, says Tiffany suffered initially from a weak public-issue market. Investors also perked up when Ratners Group PLC agreed in early July to pay 24 times this year's estimated earnings for Sterling, another U.S. jeweler.    Ms. Ruchlamer believes Tiffany will benefit from attention to its 150th birthday celebration next month, featured Friday in the syndicated &quot;Suzy&quot; society newspaper column. Tiffany is also launching a new perfume at $200 an ounce.    Other growth strategies include trying for more sales in Europe, where Tiffany has a London store and a new unit planned for Munich, and in other stores in U.S. cities without Tiffany stores. The company is also targeting the corporate market for business gifts and incentive awards.    One investor who acted before the good news became apparent was Geoffrey Musson, director of investments at the British Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund. The British fund accumulated 9.9% of Tiffany within its first five days of trading.    &quot;We've found over the course of time that the upper end of retailing is a very successful area to invest. The rich tend to spend their money through thick and thin,&quot; Mr. Musson said. He added that few other U.S. companies offer such a pure play on that theme.    ---   Tiffany andamp; Co.
