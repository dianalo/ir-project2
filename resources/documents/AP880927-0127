A similar plan last year was sharply criticized by internationalenvironmental groups, which accused Japan of conducting theexperiment to circumvent an international ban on commerical whaling.   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Japanrecently submitted the whaling plan to the International WhalingCommission for review, but decided not to publicize its contentsuntil the evaluation was complete.   They said Japan planned to catch ``very close'' to 300 minkewhales in the Antarctic this winter. The species is estimated bythe commission to number more than 430,000 worldwide.   The Japanese government says research whaling is necessary toassess whale stocks, and such factors as age, sex and health.Japanese officials say they hope the research will prove there areadequate numbers of some whale species, such as the minke, to allowa resumption of limited commercial whaling.   Last year, Japan told the commission it would kill 875 minke andsperm whales for research purposes, but strong opposition frominternational environmental groups and other commission membersreduced the catch to 273 minke whales, according to officials, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   The officials said this year's research methods will be similarto those practiced last year, when ships sailed along a fixed routeand killed only one or two whales in each group sighted.   In 1982, the commission passed an international ban oncommercial whaling to allow scientists to study whale populationswithout hunting pressure. The ban went into effect in 1986 and isto be re-evaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research results.   Japan officially ended its commercial whaling in Antarctica atthe end of the 1986-87 season, when it caught 1,941 of the mammals.   The commission's charter allows member nations to conductresearch whaling without approval from the 42-member body.   Environmentalists have charged that Japan _ where whale meat haslong been an important protein source _ is using the researchprovision to maintain its whaling industry. Japanese officials sayother commission members have not been serious about conductingresearch during the moratorium and plan merely to renew the ban in1990.   ``In the Antarctic, only Japan is conducting research,'' oneofficial said, speaking anonymously. ``The people who arecriticizing Japan are not presenting any data of their own.''</TEXT></DOC>
