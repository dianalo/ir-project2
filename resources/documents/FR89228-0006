This rule amends a number of Export ControlCommodity Numbers on the CCL in the following commodity groups: Group 0(Metal-Working Machinery), Group 1 (Chemical and Petroleum Equipment),Group 2, (Electrical and Power-Generating Equipment), Group 3 (GeneralIndustrial Equipment), Group 4 (Transportation Equipment), Group 5 (Electronicsand Precision Instruments), and Group 7 (Chemicals, Metalloids, PetroleumProducts and Related Materials). This rule also amends Supplement No. 3(Computer Software) to Part 779 of the Export Administration Regulations. These revisions have resulted from a review of strategic controls maintainedby the U.S. and certain allied countries through the Coordinating Committee(COCOM). Such multilateral controls restrict the availability of strategicitems to controlled countries. This rule raises the levels of goods thatcan be shipped to the PRC under a number of advisory notes, and adds newPRC advisory notes. It also decontrols, world-wide, certain items thathad been included in advisory notes for the Soviet Bloc. With the concurrenceof the Department of Defense, the Department of Commerce has determinedthat this rule is consistent with the U.S. national security provisionsof the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> This rule is effective February 28, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> For questions of a technicalnature on chemical and petroleum equipment, call George Kuzmycz, Officeof Technology and Policy Analysis, Telephone: (202) 377-5696.

This rule complies with Executive Order 12291 and Executive Order 12661. 2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>.). These collections have been approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget under control numbers 0694-0005, 0694-0010, 0694-0013,and 0694-0024. The reporting burden for these collections of informationis estimated to be: for 0694-0005 and 0694-0010, 45 minutes per response;for 0694-0013, 2 hours per response; and for 0694-0024, 30 minutes perresponse. These times include the time for reviewing instructions, searchingexisting data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collections. Send comments regarding the burden estimatesor any other aspect of these collections of information, including suggestionsfor reducing this burden, to the Office of Security and Management Support,Bureau of Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington,DC 20230; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503_ATTN: Paperwork ReductionProject (0694-0005, 0694-0010, 0694-0013, and 0694-0024).  3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.  4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.  5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule.  Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is noformal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome ona continuing basis.
