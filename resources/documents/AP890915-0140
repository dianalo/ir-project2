Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who introduced the bill. ``Theyhave heard many stories about contamination from toxic industrialand agricultural chemicals, medical waste products and red tides.''   The ``Fish and Fish Products Safety Act of 1989'' would requiresetting safety standards for contaminants for fish and establishinga rigorous and comprehensive inspection system.   Officials say it is more difficult to regulate fishing than themeat or poultry industry because there are 300 edible species offish in vast waters.   Contaminants for fish and shellfish include the botulism toxin,salmonella bacteria and the hepatitis-A virus, as well as PCBs andother industrial contaminants.   Dr. Frank Young, head of the Food and Drug Administration,testified before Waxman's House Energy and Commerce subcommittee onhealth and the environment that fish consumption increased to 15.4pounds person in 1987 largely because the food is low in fat.   Young said the FDA inspects only a quarter of the fish-processingplants each year. He said data from the federal Centers for DiseaseControl ``indicate that seafood does not cause illness in alarmingamounts or diversity.''   However, Ellen Haas of Public Voice, a non-profit group thatdeals with food safety issues, disagreed.   She offered a CDC study that indicated that the risk of a foodpoisoning outbreak from eating seafood is 25 times greater fromseafood than from beef, and 16 times greater than for either chickenor pork.   Dr. Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the food safety andinspection service at the Agriculture Department, said that``building on the existing meat and poultry inspection programstructure would provide a faster start up and extensive cost-savingsfor a fish and seafood inspection program.''   Legislation has been introduced in the past to give theAgriculture Department authority over seafood inspections, just asit is in charge of meat and poultry inspections. The Waxman billwould make the FDA the lead agency.   Waxman said in his opening statement Friday that ``the mostcontentious issue has become one of turf _ where authority over thenew fish inspection program should be vested.''</TEXT></DOC>
