Initial results are 0.5 {mu}A dc beamwith 43% polarization at 290 MeV. This is expected to be improved uponwith normal troubleshooting. A superconducting solenoid to be installedwithin the next few months will allow a significant further increasein both polarization and beam current 7 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
