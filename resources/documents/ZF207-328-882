(achieving binary levelcompatibility standards)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Serlin, Omri.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Most vendors of reduced-instruction-set computer (RISC)microprocessors (MPUs), such as Sun Microsystems, must comply withthe 88open's kernel-level Binary Compatibility Standard (BCSs) andits forthcoming higher level Object Compatibility Standard (OCS)or the ATandamp;T higher-level Applications Binary Interface (ABI)standard for their MPUs to gain software developer support.andP;  Suchstandards enable portability without recompilation acrossmulti-vendor systems based on the same MPU.andP;  Motorola Corp'sacceptance of the BCS-OCS standard resulted in major industrysupport despite the market leads of MIPS Computer Systems' MIPSRISC MPU and Sun's SPARC.andP;  MIPS is not worrying about compliance,as it has a strong relationship with Digital Equipment Corp. Sunhad to cede control of its RISC chip and operating system and mustdevelop a binary portability standard to gain greater marketsupport.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Impact AnalysisStandardsCompatibilityReduced-Instruction-Set ComputersRequirements AnalysisMachine LanguageManufacturers.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   88K workstation vs DECstation vs Sun 4-100 vs Sun 4-260.
