Production has stopped at major sites, and Energy Departmentofficials face a firestorm of criticism from Congress, the Pentagonand angry citizens in the 13 states where the complex operates.   ``Tell the truth!'' an irate crowd shouted last week as themanager of the Energy Department's Rocky Flats Plant, near Denver,argued that the plant's plutonium reprocessing facility was closedbecause of a single contamination incident. Investigators fromCongress and the Environmental Protection Agency had found ``veryserious'' and repeated safety violations.   ``We may sometimes not be good at explaining everything,''responded the manager, Earl Whiteman. ``But we damn well tell thetruth.''   Department officials are likely to face a lot more disbelief asthey struggle to restart nuclear reactors that produce the plutoniumand tritium needed for the nation's nuclear arsenal.   Neither is being produced now and tritium, a radioactive isotopeof hydrogen, may be in critically short supply as early as nextsummer, according to congressional sources.   Federal officials also are likely to face rising anger as theygrapple with the daunting task of cleaning up 45 years' worth ofradioactive contamination, a job the Energy Department says couldcost $110 billion.   If the Manahattan Project, which produced atomic bombs at the endof World War II, was an example of what the United States can dowhen it focuses its technological genius, then the current mess innuclear weapons production may epitomize what can happen when suchactivities are shrouded for decades in secrecy and bureaucracy.   ``This crisis has not arisen suddenly but over a long period, andit stems from inadequate attention to maintenance, safety andoperating conditions,'' 31 members of the House Armed ServicesCommittee said in a letter Thursday to Energy Secretary John S.Herrington.   The National Academy of Sciences, in a report requested byCongress, described the complex last year as ``a loose-knit systemof largely self-regulated contractors'' under little control of theEnergy Department.   The complex, comprising many potentially dangerous elements,operated under a regime dictated not by safety concerns but by theneed to produce nuclear weapons for the arms race, the academy said.   Not only were the reactors and other facilities older than thosein the civilian sector, the report said, but they were free of thestrict controls imposed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission onutilities after the near-disaster at Three Mile Island on March 28,1979.   The Energy Department is the latest in a line of civilianagencies that have built and managed the plants that turn out anestimated 1,800 nuclear weapons a year for the Pentagon under a $7.8billion budget.   The complex, which now employs about 90,000 people in 13 states _at three laboratories, two test sites, two reactor complexes and 13other sites _ was born in 1943 in the desert at Los Alamos, N.M.,where Manhattan Project scientists labored in remote secrecy.   Two other weapons laboratories were added, at Livermore, Calif.,and Sandia, N.M., and the government began operating two reactorcomplexes, the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, near Richland, Wash., in1944, and the Savannah River Plant, in Aiken, S.C., a decade later.   Other materials are produced at the Feed Materials ProductionCenter, in Fernald, Ohio; the Ashtabula Plant, Ashtubula, Ohio; theY-12 plant and Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant at Oak Ridge,Tenn.; the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho Falls,Idaho; the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, in Paducah, Ky.; and thePortsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio.   At the next step, the Rocky Flats Plant near Denver processesplutonium and assembles primary devices; the Y-12 plant manufacturessecond-stage components; the Mound Facility in Miamisburg, Ohio,makes detonators and firing circuit components; the Kansas CityPlant, in Kansas City, Mo., makes non-nuclear parts; and thePinellas Plant, in St. Petersburg, Fla., makes neutron generators,according to ``The Nuclear Weapons Databook,'' written by Tom B.Cochran of the National Resources Defense Council.   All the components are shipped to the Pantex Plant, nearAmarillo, Texas, assembled into warheads and given to the DefenseDepartment, according to the NRDC, a private environmental group inWashington.   Nuclear devices are tested underground at two sites in NyeCounty, Nevada, the Nevada Test Range and the Tonopah Test Range.   Congress has ordered that the Energy Department review all thesites and produce a report by mid-December on which to modernize andwhich, if any, to close, said department spokesman Will Callicott.   Energy Department plans do not call for the construction of a newgeneration of nuclear weapons reactors until well into the nextdecade, a $3.2 billion facility at Savannah River and a $3.6 billionfacility in Idaho. Budget austerity could cause further delays orcancellation of one site.   The public and Congress began to complain of serious problems inthe nuclear weapons production complex years ago. Although mostattention has focused on problems at Hanford, Savannah River,Fernald and Rocky Flats, an Energy Department report issued in Junecited problems at nearly every facility and said remedying themwould cost $66 billion to $110 billion.   The biggest expense will be at the Hanford Reservation, where allnine reactors have been closed down. In January 1987, engineersplaced the last of them, the N-Reactor, in ``cold standby,'' 25years after it entered operation.   The Energy Department, in 19,000 pages of documents released inFebruary 1986, detailed significant spills of radioactive materialover 43 years, particularly during the Cold War years, when secrecywas the by-word and the health hazards of radiation were not as wellunderstood as they are today.   The cost of upgrading and decontaminating the Hanford Reservationwas forecast by the Energy Department at $2.4 billion through 1995,with further corrective actions forecast as high as $46 billion over50 years.   Department officials have estimated that it could take 18 monthsto restart N-reactor, if it were needed.   The other reactor complex, Savannah River, faces problems thatare almost as serious. All three reactors there have been shut down,none will be allowed to run at above 50 percent power in the future,and a select team of engineers is trying to design new safetyprocedures for a month-long ``phased start-up'' of one reactor,starting no earlier than December.   The cost of correcting problems at Savannah River and cleaning upcontamination is expected to run to $3.6 billion through 1985 and ashigh as $8.8 billion thereafter.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
