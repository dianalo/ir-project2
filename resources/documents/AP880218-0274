The experimental chips can retrieve a bit of information in 20billionths of a second, three times as fast as the currentgeneration of so-called D-RAM chips.   D-RAM chips are the most common kind of memory chips incomputers. They are more compact and cheaper but also slower thanstatic random access memory chips, known as S-RAMs.   Separately, IBM said it had built an experimental S-RAM chipthat can retrieve information in a record 11 billionths of asecond. It announced another experimental S-RAM capable of storing1 million bits of information, unprecedented for that kind of chip.   The announcements were made at the annual InternationalSolid-State Circuits Conference, an event that draws topresearchers from the United States, Europe and Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
