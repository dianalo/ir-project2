These final rules will eliminate those instances where OPM doesnot receive the prescribed employee deduction or agency contribution becausean agency has inadvertently failed to withhold some or all of the employee'sretirement deductions or failed to reduce the salary of a reemployed annuitant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 13, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Patricia A. Rochester, (202) 632-4682.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>These regulations establish final proceduresfor correcting agency administrative errors in collecting the appropriatededuction from an employee's basic pay for the CSR Fund. On May 21, 1987,we published (at 52 FR 19150) proposed regulations revising our policyon correcting underdeductions for the CSR Fund and submitting the necessarydeductions to OPM. Interested parties were given until July 20, 1987, tocomment.We received 5 comments. All were carefully considered in preparing thefinal regulations. The changes and clarifications made based on the commentsare summarized below.1. <T3>Consistency between CSRS and FERS.</T3> One comment suggested thatprocedures for correcting errors and submitting agency and employee contributionsbe more consistent for the Civil Service Retirement (CSRS) and FederalEmployee Retirement Systems (FERS). Since the two retirement systems havesubstantial differences in the statutory provisions regarding contributions,it is not practical to attempt consistency in all areas of the correctionprocess. However, we have tried to establish parallel procedures whereappropriate.2. <T3>Time periods for submitting employee contributions. </T3>Several commentsexpressed concern over the 60-day period allowed in andSection; 831.111(b)(2)for submitting the balance of employee contributions in cases where onlysome of the required deductions were made. The commenters felt that anemployee could not reasonably be expected to make a large payment of partialemployee contributions in so short a period without financial hardship.In actuality, for partial employee contributions, the proposed regulationsdid not require employees to make payment within 60 days. Rather, theyrequired the agency to submit the amount owed via SF 2812. In other words,the agency is expected to immediately correct the employee's record andto erase the liability to the CSR Fund by submitting both the employeedeductions and matching agency contributions. The salary overpayment debtwhich the employee owes to the agency can be disposed of later, in accordancewith section 5584 or 5514 of title 5, United States Code (or other applicablestatutes). This is consistent with the treatment of underdeductions forFERS retirement contributions. The same procedure could not be followedin CSRS cases where none of the required retirement deductions were withheldbecause in those situations employees have the option to make a depositdirectly to the CSRS Fund rather than have the agency correct their retirementrecord.Nevertheless, agency comments indicated that a 60-day standard for submissionof employee deductions_as well as agency contributions_may not always bereasonable. Therefore, the 60-day time limit has been dropped. The regulationsnow state that the agency must submit employee and agency contributionsas soon as possible, but not later than provided by standards establishedby OPM. Specific time limits will be established in a future Federal PersonnelManual letter, thus providing greater flexibility.3. <T3>Interest payable on underpaid retirement contributions.</T3> One commentersuggested that the proposed rule be revised to include an agency obligationto pay any interest which may be due as a result of the administrativeerror causing the underdeduction. However, the procedure established bythis rule does not require the payment of interest on the employee shareof the underpaid retirement contribution if the employee elects to havethe agency take corrective action and makes any associated payments tothe employing agency. If the employee elects to delay payment of the depositby not having the employing agency take the necessary corrective actionor failing to make any required payments to the agency, the optional depositor annuity computation made by OPM will reflect an interest charge forthe unpaid deposit as required by 5 U.S.C. 8334(e). In the latter circumstances,we do not feel that the agency should be responsible for the interest paymentsif the employee did not wish to undertake his or her share of responsibilityin resolving the error at the time of its discovery.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because the regulations willonly affect Federal employees and retirees and their survivors.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 831</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Disability benefits, Firefighters,Government employees, Income tax, Intergovernmental relations, Law enforcementofficers, Pensions, Retirement.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM amends 5 CFR Part 831 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 831_RETIREMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_Administration and General Provisions</ITAG>1.
