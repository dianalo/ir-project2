Silas said putting leased OPEC oil in the U.S. StrategicPetroleum Reserve would only add complications in the event of aserious U.S. dispute with a leasor country.   ``It may end up in a confrontation where you'd have tonationalize'' the leased oil, Silas said.   The Phillips chairman was responding to questions from EnergySecretary James D. Watkins, who told Silas his department wasconsidering a variety of ways of reducing the cost of filling theoil reserve, which now hold 580 million barrels of oil in a seriesof underground salt domes in Louisiana and Texas.   Watkins indicated his department, in considering the oil reservequestion as part of a broader national energy strategy, had not yetdecided whether the less costly leasing option would enhance ordetract from U.S. energy security.   The department had disclosed earlier this year that SaudiArabia, the No. 1 foreign supplier of oil to the U.S. market, hadexpressed interest in leasing oil for the emergency reserve,although no specific proposals had been discussed.   Watkins told Wednesday's hearing ``many nations of the world areapproaching us rather aggressively'' about participating in aleasing program. He did not name any of the countries.   Donald E. Milsten, director of the Maryland Energy Office andvice chairman of the National Association of State Energy Offices,told Watkins his association was concerned about the leasing ideabut had not yet formed a firm opinion.   The strategic reserve ``might not be seen as a serious defensemechanism'' in an oil supply emergency if part of the stockpile wasleased rather than owned by the U.S. government, Milsten said.</TEXT></DOC>
