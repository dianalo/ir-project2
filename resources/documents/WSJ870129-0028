But for all of 1986, Britain posted its first annual deficit on the current account since 1979, the Department of Trade and Industry said. The current account comprises trade in goods, services and certain unilateral transfers.    The merchandise-trade deficit, meanwhile, soared in 1986 from the previous year, as the country, a major exporter of oil, felt the full impact of declining oil prices.    December's current account swung to a surplus equivalent to $58.6 million from a deficit in November of $357.6 million. However, the surplus was narrower than the $550.3 million surplus a year earlier. The merchandise-trade deficit narrowed to $1.18 billion last month from $1.59 billion in November but widened from the $80.2 million of December 1985.    For all of 1986, the United Kingdom's current account slipped $288.3 million into the red, in contrast to a surplus of $5.47 billion in 1985. The trade deficit for all of last year soared to $13.38 billion from $3.25 billion in 1985. All figures have been seasonally adjusted.    The December statistics suggest that British exporters have begun to take advantage of the recent decline in the pound's value to sell more on foreign markets. </TEXT></DOC>
