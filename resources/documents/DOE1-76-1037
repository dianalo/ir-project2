After serial passage of the leukaemic cells into syngeneicrecipients, they grow faster and require fewer cells for a take. Transplantationof primary leukaemias requires high cell doses unlike passaged linesderived from them. Passaging at low cell doses retains their primary-likegrowth and morphological properties. It would seem that these low celldose passages may be a more useful model which can be used for investigatingthe biology and therapeutic responses of myeloid leukaemia than routinelypassaged cell lines.</TEXT></DOC>
