At 2 p.m. (8 p.m. EDT) the storm was centered 325 miles southsouthwest of Honolulu, or 345 miles south of Lihue, Kauai, withmaximum sustained winds of 100 mph and gusts to 120 mph, theweather service said.   Uleki was moving to the north at 2 to 3 mph, but that wasexpected to pick up slightly to about 5 mph, Lee said.   The storm had wind gusts up to 150 mph when it stalled about 360miles south southeast of Honolulu on Friday night after making asurprise turn towards the islands earlier in the day.   ``Yesterday, the storm had a small, tight center. Today, it's alarge sprawling center. That's ususally an indication it isweakening,'' Lee said.   Even if Hawaii is spared the storm's worst winds, Uleki probablywill bring strong winds and rain to the islands sometime Sunday,Lee said.   ``Uleki is still a dangerous hurricane. Everyone should beprepared,'' he said.   A tropical storm watch was posted for the islands of Oahu, Kauaiand Niihau, meaning wind speeds of 39 mph to 73 mph were possiblethrough Sunday morning. A high surf advisory was posted for thesouthern coasts of all islands.   It was the second storm in a month to threaten the islands.Hurricane Fabio was on a course toward the islands in early Augustbut then veered off and weakened, producing only some heavy rain onparts of Kauai.</TEXT></DOC>
