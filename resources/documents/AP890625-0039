West Africa's Mauritania was rated the most potentially unstablenation in the world in the analysis released Sunday by thePopulation Crisis Committee, which advocates birth control.   Japan finished at the other end of the scale, the most stablenation.   And the United States fell in the ``moderate'' category, losingground to 16 countries rated as more stable because of thiscountry's ethnic conflicts and high rate of youth unemployment.   ``Rapid population growth, especially when overlaid with sharpethnic divisions, places enormous strains on politicalinstitutions,'' observed the study, compiled by Sharon L. Camp,Marshall Green and Patricia G. Barnett.   Many nations seem to be striving to develop democracy. ``Whetherthese fragile new democracies survive or not will depend partly onthe intensity of population pressures and the strains they add tothe problems of governance,'' said Camp.   Green, a retired ambassador, observed that ``not surprisingly thetwo most deeply troubled areas of the globe are Africa and theMiddle East, with the world's highest growth rates.''   The new analysis, published in the form of a wall chartcontaining a world map of population pressures and growth rates, wascompiled by establishing statistical ratings of a variety of factorsand totaling the results.   Population growth rates, movement to urban areas, the agestructure of populations, growth of the labor force and presence orabsence of ethnic and language division in a country were the majorpopulation factors considered.   In addition, the study took into account changes in governmentover the last 30 years or so, political freedoms, civil liberties,ethnic or religious conflicts and an estimate of the satisfaction orfrustration of youth in a country.   Mauritania, situated astride the Sahara desert, led the list forinstability with a 95 score out of a possible 100. It also rankedhigh in the separate population pressure rankings, scoring 71 out of100.   Rounding out the five most unstable nations were Ethiopia,scoring 87; Zaire, 83; and Burundi and the Sudan, 81 each.   All five have been through several governments and all but Zairescored the maximum in communal violence, with bitter conflictsunderway in several of these countries. And all five also rankedhigh in the study of population pressures.   On the 100-point instability scale, Japan accumulated only 13points and was also near the bottom of the population pressuresstudy.   The United States, by comparison, accumulated 31 points in theinstability analysis.   Both nations managed a top ranking of 1 point for governmentchanges, political and civil rights.   In the category of ethnic and religious conflicts, however, whileJapan had 1 point the United States scored 10 out of a possible 20.   And, in the dissatisfied youth category, unemployment hurt theU.S., which scored 18 out of 40 possible points, compared to 9points for Japan.   Countries falling in between Japan and the United States wereNorway, 18; Switzerland, 20; Italy, Denmark and Australia, 21 each;Sweden and Belgium, 22 each; West Germany, 23; Venezuela, 24; CostaRica, 25; Jamaica, 28; Netherlands, 29; and Greece, Canada andBotswana, 30 each.   Tied with the United States at a rating of 31 were Spain andFrance.   In the report the committee, which advocates family planning,concluded that ``it is clear from trends widely evident in the worldthat rapid growth of a country's population, along with itsmaldistribution, will impose great strains on existing political,social and economic structures and on relations between nations.''   Of 120 countries studied, 101 showed a relationship betweenpopulation pressures and political stability, the group concluded.It said that only a handful of governments with rapid populationgrowth have maintained stable governments with good records on civiland political rights, notably Botswana, Jamaica, Costa Rica, Gambiaand Venezuela.   China, where student attempts to promote democracy recently endedin military violence, scored a 57 rating on the index, placing it inthe ``high'' category for instability.   That score may be too low in light of recent events, thecommittee said in an addendum issued with the report.</TEXT></DOC>
