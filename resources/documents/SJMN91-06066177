We hadsome holes to fill. And we did. It shows the character and quality of ourplayers.&quot;;    Lopez counted on several other players returning from lastseason's team, which finished 12-10. And there soon came a moment, early inthe season, when the team realized just how successful it might be, playing inan eight-team tournament in Gilroy against junior varsity teams, a step abovethe freshman-sophomore team.;    Hill utterly dominated. None of the gameswere close, and the team won the championship over Harbor 74-48.;    ForLopez, having talented players like Peter Redmond, Sean Werner, Paul McGill,guard Thanh Bui and his brother Lam Bui had indicated that these types of winscould be expected. Lopez, however, credits the emergence of Eddie Castro forproviding the kind of team that can finish a season unbeaten.;    With Castrofilling a forward role on a team built around pressing defense and the fastbreak, Hill dominated not only the Gilroy tournament but the rest of theseason.;    &quot;I told him 'This team is like a puzzle with a piece missing,' &quot;Lopez said. &quot;And you know what? You just filled it.' &quot;;    For Hill forwardPeter Redmond, the tournament eliminated his doubts of his own team'spotential.;    &quot;The team fooled around sometimes,&quot; he said. &quot;But when we goton the court it was all business. All business. That's the difference.&quot;;   &quot;Our expectations changed after that tournament,&quot; said Werner, a sophomore whoaveraged 10 points per game. &quot;We believed we could compete. Soon everyone waslooking to knock us off.&quot;;    As the season progressed, win built upon win,and the team would face traditional basketball powers like Milpitas andIndependence high schools and win -- over Milpitas 33-31, Independence 52-50.;   Lopez likes reflecting on beating Milpitas.;    &quot;We were similar types ofteams; they played the same way we do -- trapping and defense. But the thingis they had a 6-foot-6 guy (David Burnside). We didn't have that. It was thebest game of the year.&quot;;    Hill established a lead early and won, overcomingthe height differential. Hill's tallest players are 6-2. &quot;There weren't manyteams that were smaller than us,&quot; said Redmond, a 6-1 sophomore.;    Afterwinning the Homestead tournament, the season culminated with a 45-38 win overJames Lick High School earlier this month. Then the team paid the greatesttribute to their coach on his birthday. They decorated the outside of his homewith toilet paper.;    &quot;These are great kids,&quot; said Lopez, a stray roll stillperched on his roof. &quot;It really becomes a family kind of atmosphere.&quot;;    Sowhat is Lopez's secret to success? Hussle, for one thing, Lopez says.;   &quot;There was a loose ball. And we have a rule that you must get (dive) for looseballs. Well, we had guys on the bench get up and were ready to dive. That justtickled me,&quot; said Lopez.;    Also, the team played together during the summerwith workouts that include 5-mile runs at Hellyer Park.;    There is anemphasis on teamwork, defense and players filling a role. Hill players workwell together, finding the open man with a quick pass and anticipating wellteammates moves.;    Lam Bui led the team in scoring, averaging 17.5 pointsper game, many from three-point range. &quot;He is a pure shooter,&quot; said Lopez,noting how opponents began focusing on him after he scored over 30 points inseveral early season contests.;    Bui's older brother, Thanh, the team'spoint guard, averaged 6.2 assists per game. Thanh Bui's leadership set thetone for the team. &quot;We call him 'the general,' &quot; said Lopez. &quot;Most coachescome up to me and say 'if we could have one of your players, it would be him.'&quot;;    Up front Redmond, Werner, Castro and McGill provide the Falcons withpower and rebounding. Castro, says Lopez, &quot;is probably the best athlete in theupcoming classes. He jumps well, and is strong enough to play inside. He'svery competitive.&quot; McGill, 6-2, is credited with leading the Falcons tocomeback wins over Mount Pleasant High School and Lick.;    Redmond'sdefensive abilities have led teammates to call him &quot;Spider&quot;; Werner's courtpresence is another weapon. Larry Stamper and Jabari Hamilton also gainedvaluable experience, said Lopez.;    Meanwhile, those four varsity sophomoreshelped that team finish 7-15, a losing but very good effort considering theteam's youthful composition.;    &quot;You could say I played with a j.v. team andhe (Lopez) had the freshman-sophomore team,&quot; said Hill varsity coach DennisFernandez. &quot;What it (the freshman-sophomore team) does is give a real footholdto the program. This season is a credit to the coach and team.&quot;;    Fernandezand Lopez both played high school basketball at San Jose High Academy in themid-1960s. Lopez hadn't found a chance to coach until Fernandez asked him tolead the freshman-sophomore team at the start of the 1987-'88 season. Lopez, aletter carrier who is still active as a basketball player, accepted. His firstteam went 6-15, improving to 15-7 the next year. Lopez said he likes beingpart of building a solid program, one that he says the school has not alwayshad. He wants to make Hill players become known for their sportsmanship andnot for an acceptance of winning brawls instead of games.;    Werner thinksthe team is earning respect.;    &quot;When people thought of Hill they thought ofa sorry team. Other players said that. I think we've changed in a few people'seyes.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ANDREW AYRES, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910306  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,050  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 6, 199100066177,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
