Robertson, the TV evangelist whose presidential star fadedquickly in an often-acrimonious primary campaign, described Bush as``a principled conservative'' and dismissed suggestions that hisbackers would sit out this election.   ``We care because it does matter,'' Robertson said.   As expected, Robertson's backers, who had hoped to make theconvention their own, staged only a brief demonstration waving blueand white signs and brightly colored umbrellas.   His late-night speech came as many attending the conventionbegan slipping out of the hall for the evening, leaving big blocksof empty seats. Two of the networks cut away from his speech infavor of other convention coverage as Robertson went severalminutes past prime time.   Robertson has spent the convention's opening days preachingparty unity, and praising the conservative direction the partycharted in its platform.   Now, he said, it's time for conservatives and fundamentalists tojoin the Bush campaign.   ``I release my delegates and alternates who have come to thisconvention and urge you and all of my friends across America togive your enthusiastic support to our party, our candidates and ourpresidential nominee,'' Robertson said.   ``It matters to us and our children whether we vote Democrat orwhether we vote Republican,'' Robertson said.   Robertson also attacked Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis as``the most liberal candidate ever put forward for the presidency byany major party in American history'' and said Democrats ``do notspeak for America today.''   In one of the sharpest attacks of the convention on Democratswho held their convention last month, Robertson insisted ``theliberal mind set reigns supreme'' in that party.   ``Now the Democratic Party has discovered the family,''Robertson said. ``But let's keep in mind that they want you and meto be in one family with Jim Wright as the daddy, Barbara Mikulskias the momma and Ted Kennedy as the big brother.   ``They offer unlimited government, massive transfers of wealthfrom the productive sector of society to the non-productive, andever-increasing regulation of the daily lives of the people andtheir children.''   In his prime-time speech and in a joint appearance with GeorgeW. Bush, the vice president's son, earlier Tuesday, Robertsonsought not only to bring his supporters into the Bush camp but alsoto cement his role as a leader of the GOP's conservative wing andguarantee a future that might include another run for the WhiteHouse, backers said.   Robertson's presidential hopes died early this year in an oftenbruising campaign, and some strategists worried that his backers,many of them fundamentalist Christians involved for the first timein politics, would simply drift away without strong urging fromRobertson.   ``Michael Dukakis is a card-carrying member of the ACLU(American Civil Liberties Union), an organization dedicated toremoving all public affirmation of religious faith in America,''Robertson said. ``As president, Michael Dukakis will pack thefederal courts with ACLU radicals.''</TEXT></DOC>
