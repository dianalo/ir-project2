(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   One tip that Weyerhaeuser is taking boldsteps with its newest sawmill is the bed of pansies in the log yard.   Weyerhaeuser, a leading exporter of logs to Japan, has gone astep further to produce precision-sawn, metric-dimension lumber forJapanese home builders, for whom the appearance of wood fortraditional post-and-beam construction counts more than thestructural strength valued in the American market.   ``We want to put out logs to the highest value market. In recentyears the highest value has been offshore,'' said operations managerJack Taylor.   So the company scrapped an aging mill in North Bend on thesouthern coast and converted a cedar plant here into its mill of the'90s, called CBX.   ``We're pulling out all the stops,'' said superintendent SamDickey as he showed off the paved log yard, laser-guided saws,flowers and a new management style that emphasizes teamwork. ``We'respending $1 million on the upgrade.''   But high-tech also means fewer jobs. When Weyerhaeuser announcedthe CBX project in January, North Bend employed about 200 andproduced about 65 million board feet a year, about 3 jobs permillion board feet. The CBX crew of 69 can produce 45 million boardfeet a year, or 1.5 jobs per million feet.   The mills that survive the current shakeup in the industry mustbe extremely efficient, and Dickey expects his hand-picked crew tolead the way. ``We're aiming to have this site be the model for theindustry.''   To emphasize that point, Weyerhaeuser has installed catwalks forvisitors.   ``All the major Japanese trading companies have been here once ortwice,'' said Dickey, who is learning Japanese.   While Weyerhaeuser took the obvious steps of upgrading thephysical plant at CBX, it also is going where no sawmill has gonebefore in its contract with the International Woodworkers of America.   ``Basically, it lets people work as teams rather than inindividual job situations,'' said Milo Summerville, fieldrepresentative for IWA Local 3-261. ``Sometimes you have to givesomething like this a trial period to see if it will work.''   Lumber grader Al Esch is enthusiastic about being able to rotatethrough three positions rather than sticking to one job. ``It's kindof like being an immigrant in a new country,'' he said.   Cheryl Howell, an 11-year veteran of the company, scored well ona hand-eye coordination test, and was cross-trained to runbark-stripping machinery and giant loaders in the yard. ``Beforeit's done, I expect to know how to run everything in here,'' shesaid.   The first shift starts at 6:30 a.m., with workers and managersjoining in 10 minutes of exercises, followed by as much as 45minutes of talk as the crew helps make management decisions. Toemphasize teamwork, Weyerhaeuser scrapped an old cleanup contractand made everyone, including Dickey, responsible for keeping themill clean.   Dickey is happy to get away from the old-style managementapproach he calls ``big brain-little brain.''   ``Generally you get dissatisfied employees because they arestarved for information,'' he said. ``We're giving them a big pieceof the operation.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, June 22</NOTE></DOC>
