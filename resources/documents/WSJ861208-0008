IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/08/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDEST AFRICPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><TEXT>   Iran's startling success in breaking the U.S. arms embargo against it will enhance its already dominant stature within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries when the group meets Thursday in Geneva to fashion a strategy for higher oil prices.    As a result, Arab, African and Latin American sources in OPEC said, the unfolding arms-for-hostages scandal will favor Iran's views on how to boost prices far above the present general average of $13 a barrel and consolidate the political consensus it has forged inside OPEC in favor of this policy.    In addition, the sources said, talk in Washington of the role played by top Saudi arms merchant Adnan Khashoggi in securing arms for Iran will hamper King Fahd's campaign to wrestle from Iran the political initiative inside OPEC. This was a principal concern of the Saudi monarch last month when he replaced his former Saudi oil minister, Ahmed Zaki Yamani, with the planning minister, Hisham Nazer.    OPEC sources interviewed last week agreed that while all 13 member countries support Saudi Arabia's call for an increase in prices to at least $18 a barrel, they are divided on how to achieve this.    &quot;The political consensus is there,&quot; said Charles T. Maxwell, oil strategist for the New York brokerage firm Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., &quot;but it may not be enough.&quot;    Some members, including Iran, Algeria and Libya, advocate further cuts in oil production from OPEC's current level of about 17.3 million barrels a day, hoping that will push prices higher. Mideast political observers said that, especially in view of the furor surrounding the Iranian arms-for-hostages deal with the Reagan administration, Iran's views are likely to get a great deal of attention.    Other members are promoting the notion of a fixed price below which OPEC producers would refuse to sell oil. Still others believe the higher price should be achieved slowly by preserving current production quotas while tightening cartel discipline to eliminate overproduction.    These differences must be resolved for the first time in 24 years without Mr. Yamani, once the group's foremost strategist. In his place, the ever-discreet Mr. Nazer, who has been named acting oil minister, will be representing his country for the first time at an OPEC meeting.    Senior Saudi and Arab sources who have been in touch with Mr. Nazer in the past few days said that in private conversations he has been stressing the need for greater OPEC unity, shorter and less-frequent meetings, and a more &quot;professional&quot; attitude in the group's secretariat to boost the cartel's &quot;image as a price-setter for oil markets.&quot;    Mr. Yamani was dismissed last month because of his defiance of King Fahd's instruction that a way to boost oil prices be found soon. His endless, byzantine negotiating style also contributed to his ouster.    Arab and OPEC sources said the political consensus within OPEC will be promoted aggressively by Iran, which originated the higher-price strategy, persuading Saudi Arabia and Kuwait last summer to turn away from their price war. &quot;The Iranians gained the upper hand as far back as August, long before Saudi Arabia carried the flag for higher prices,&quot; said a senior OPEC delegate, who asked not to be identified. &quot;The Iranians will run this (coming) meeting without doubt, and everyone will fall in line.&quot;    Saudi sources, who claim their country has now regained the political initiative in OPEC as the champion of higher prices, said that because the king tied his name to the $18-a-barrel price goal -- a boost of about $5 a barrel from current levels -- he will make every effort to push OPEC to achieve that goal.    As a result, Saudi and Arab industry sources said, OPEC inevitably will propose a further production cut sometime early next year, if not this month.    &quot;We know, and King Fahd knows, that to raise prices you've got to cut production,&quot; said a well-placed Saudi industry source, who asked not to be identified. He added that &quot;a production-cut proposal (by Saudi Arabia) is the trump card (in the OPEC talks), and it will be something on the order of 5% for everyone.&quot;    OPEC and industry sources said that since any such cut will be felt most by the Saudis, who produce a quarter of OPEC's exports, Mr. Nazer will insist before joining any agreement to cut production that all members adhere strictly to their production quotas.    Industry sources said Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, both close Saudi allies, currently are exceeding their production quotas. Sources placed Kuwaiti production at 1.1 million barrels a day against a quota of 999,000 barrels a day. The United Arab Emirates is producing 1.2 million barrels a day against a quota of 950,000 barrels a day.    Saudi Arabia itself is producing nearly six million barrels a day, far above its official OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day. But the increase is justified by the need to fill a newly expanded pipeline that carries oil from the country's east coast to the Red Sea port of Yanbu. The pipeline had been emptied in advance of construction in September.    The additional OPEC production has been offset by a sharp fall in Iranian oil exports under the impact of Iraqi air raids, and hasn't affected the market. Iranian exports are as much as an average of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day below last year's average of 1.8 million barrels a day. </TEXT></DOC>
