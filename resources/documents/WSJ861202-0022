The former executive, Donald A. Halliday, 53 years old, of Chatsworth, Calif., also was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to pay back taxes and penalties after pleading guilty to accepting more than $25,000 in other kickbacks, Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Heather said.    Peter Brown, an attorney for Mr. Halliday, called the sentence &quot;tentative.&quot; He said he believes the sentence may be modified at a hearing scheduled for April because Mr. Halliday is in ill health, and because he is cooperating with the government in its investigation of defense contracting practices.    Sierracin is a Sylmar, Calif.-based maker of high technology products. Mr. Halliday, formerly a director of material for a Sierracin division, is one of 19 defense company executives who were charged with involvement in illegal kickback schemes last summer. According to Mr. Heather, three of those defendants are awaiting trial early next year, and the rest have pleaded guilty to various charges. </TEXT></DOC>
