But clinching the deal required the approval of oil ministersfrom Saudi Arabia and its three Persian Gulf Arab allies, who saidthey needed to consult their governments first.   A meeting of all OPEC oil ministers was set for tonight atcartel headquarters, but it was not certain a final decision wouldbe made then.   Eight of the 13 members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries agreed in a meeting that ended early today to aproposed 2 percent cut in OPEC's total oil production, according tooil ministers from Iran and Venezuela.   The cuts would be for May and June only, said Venezuelan OilMinister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti.   The Saudis earlier indicated they opposed production cuts,believing prices would rebound soon anyway since oil demand islikely to rise this summer.   Saudi King Fahd said in a newspaper interview Thursday that OPECshould simply stick to its current set of production quotas, whichoften are exceeded. He did not explicitly rule out cuts as small asthose proposed in Vienna.   Besides Saudi Arabia, the others saying they wanted to think itover were Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.   Iraq, which is not party to OPEC's existing agreement onproduction limits, was not expected to take part in the proposedcuts, Hernandez said.   The eight that tentatively accepted the deal this morning wereIran, Algeria, Libya, Nigeria, Gabon, Venezuela, Ecuador andIndonesia. The proposal was put on the table by Algeria.   The proposed cuts in output, in conjunction with similarly smallcuts by a group of six independent oil-producing nations, wouldremove a total of 500,000 barrels a day from the world oil market.   The goal is to lift oil prices to OPEC's target of $18 a42-gallon barrel from the range now of between $14 and $16.   Oil prices on the open market moved erratically in nervoustrading Friday. Prices fell more than 60 cents a barrel in Europebut recovered in later U.S. trading.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June contracts for WestTexas Intermediate, the main U.S. grade of oil, closed at $17.99 abarrel, up one cent from Thursday. At one point, the price was off43 cents but then recovered.   The proposed OPEC cuts are so small that analysts said the maineffect on the market would be psychological. For OPEC, theprincipal benefit would be establishing closer ties to rival oilproducers, who in recent years have weakened OPEC by taking awayits market share.   OPEC and non-OPEC producers have never before formally agreed tomutual cuts in production, although Mexico has informally sought toalign its policies with OPEC.   The non-OPEC countries involved in the current proposal areMexico, Egypt, China, Oman, Malaysia and Angola.   Representatives of these independent producers were in Viennaearlier this week for talks with a committee of six OPEC oilministers. They left before OPEC's meeting began Thursday, so itwas not immediately clear if they would be satisfied with theproposed cut of 2 percent, or 300,000 barrels a day, in OPECproduction.   The non-OPEC group stipulated it would cut its oil exports by 5percent, or 200,000 barrels a day, only if OPEC made ``similar,proportional'' reductions. It was not more precise about thereciprocity.   Regardless of the outcome of the talks on production cuts, OPECintended to step up contacts with the non-OPEC group in hopes ofestablishing a regular dialogue that could lead to morecoordination of production and pricing policy in the future,several oil ministers said.   ``We must send a positive signal to them,'' said GholamrezaAghazadeh, the oil minister of Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
