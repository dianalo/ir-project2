With 7,200 employees, hundreds of research projects and an annual budget exceeding $900 million, the consortium, Bell Communications Research Inc., is among the nation's largest research and engineering joint ventures. Known as Bellcore, it serves as the seven Baby Bells' version of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s highly respected Bell Laboratories research concern.    By agreement, none of the seven owners can leave the venture without giving three years' notice. U S West said it had sent a letter to Bellcore fulfilling that requirement.    Bellcore, based in Livingston, N.J., was formed in the breakup of the Bell System in 1984 to maintain common standards for the nation's telephone system, to ensure smooth operation of the network and to coordinate telecommunications operations during national emergencies. A major focus has been to perform research for the local telephone companies owned by the regional Bell holding companies, which in turn own Bellcore. That research involves network planning and setting common standards for telephone-system equipment and software.    But it is precisely that focus that U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., cites as an &quot;obstacle&quot; to its continued participation in Bellcore. The company believes Bellcore's role should begin to reflect the industry's growing competition, particularly the intensifying rivalry among the seven Bellcore owners. Specifically, U S West believes Bellcore should undertake more projects whose results aren't shared among the seven.    In a letter to Bellcore, U S West said the research company needs to &quot;develop and expand proprietary exclusive research and development activities for individual companies.&quot;    A related problem, U S West said, is Bellcore's &quot;governing process, which develops (research) projects by the concensus of the owners/customers.&quot;    U S West, which expressed reluctance in taking its action, told Bellcore in its letter that it wants to sell or &quot;otherwise dispose&quot; of its stock in the venture.    A Bellcore spokesman reacted cautiously. &quot;We aren't taking the notice lightly, and we are hopeful it can be worked out,&quot; he said. He noted that having seven powerful owners &quot;presents a strong challenge to the people who run Bellcore.&quot; None of the other partners has issued similar notices.    U S West's departure, if it happens, wouldn't become effective until 1990. Because of that, some of the other partners dismissed the notice as a tactic by U S West to promote proprietary work. An official of St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. expressed surprise at the letter, noting that U S West recently joined the other owners in a letter to Bellcore's president supporting the concern's projects. Several others said they were satisfied with Bellcore's role and noted that some of its research is exclusive.    &quot;Our view is that we are satisfied with what is happening with Bellcore, and our relationship with it,&quot; said Bruce R. DeMeayer, president of Ameritech Service Co., a unit of Chicago-based Ameritech. &quot;U S West has a considerably different view of what should happen at Bellcore.&quot;    Robert Morris III, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., suggested that it would be generally imprudent for regional Bell concerns to express public dissatisfaction with Bellcore. Ultimately, telephone customers shoulder the cost of supporting Bellcore, so state regulators might be apt to cut rates if the telephone companies declare that Bellcore isn't effective, he said.    &quot;Frankly, you can't blame these companies for questioning the relationship with Bellcore,&quot; Mr. Morris added, however. &quot;They are slowly emerging as competitors among themselves. It is awfully difficult to get proprietary technology.&quot;    William G. Burns, a vice chairman of New York-based Nynex Corp. who helped establish Bellcore, said the concept for the venture remains valid, despite the dispute. Bellcore has a &quot;critical mass of highly competent and technical people,&quot; he said. &quot;If the regional companies each had to create the capabilities they can have and share at Bellcore, they couldn't afford it.&quot;    In fact, U S West has been concerned about the arrangements since the beginning. It is understood that the company concedes Bellcore's vast talent pool but is frustated that it can't get researchers to focus on projects it deems important. Moreover, U S West regards Bellcore's consensus approach as cumbersome, requiring numerous panels and committees. The company also is known to be extremely uncomfortable with sharing information.    Some partners pointed out, and U S West acknowledges, that gradual changes are occurring. A newly commissioned Bellcore task force is studying the issue of proprietary projects and others, such as how projects are funded.    Similar consortiums have shown signs of strain recently. Last week, Microelectronics andamp; Computer Technology Corp. announced that Lockheed Corp., Unisys Corp. and Allied-Signal Inc. planned to leave the 20-member technological research consortium at the end of 1987. And U.S. semiconductor makers are discussing forming a consortium to compete with the Japanese, but the venture faces financial and legal hurdles. </TEXT></DOC>
