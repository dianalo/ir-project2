<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0983 </DOCNO><TEXT>Marble and limestone briquette samples (each weighing 0.7-0.9 kg, withan upper surface area of 62 sq. cm) have been exposed since 1984 to bothanthropogenic acid deposition from the environment and natural weatheringat four field sites instrumented to record environmental data. At eachof the sites, located near Raleigh, NC, Chester, NJ, Newcomb, NY, andin Washington, DC, 72 briquettes of each stone type were exposed in racksinclined 30{sup 0} from the horizontal toward the south. Similar testsof the stone materials were initiated at a fifth site, in Steubenville,OH, in 1986; sheltered samples that receive clean rain in volumes equivalentto ambient rain were added to that site in 1987. The effects of the environmenton the briquettes and other materials exposed at the sites have beenassessed periodically by investigators from several US agencies cooperatingin the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program. Tests conductedby Argonne National Laboratory for the stone exposure program duringthe first three years of sample exposure included measurements of materialloss and chemical analyses of stone alteration. Material loss was monitoredby periodic weighings of briquettes dried after exposure and by a sensitivelaser-moire method applied to surfaces of specially designed specimens.Chemical alteration was detected by analyses for sulfates, nitrates,chlorides, and fluorides, and for a series of metal cations, in sequentiallayers of stone removed from samples after field exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
