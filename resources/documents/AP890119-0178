What happened on his fifth mercy mission remains a mystery, butother Western hostages freed since he vanished have reported seeinga man in an underground prison they believed was the 6-foot-7 Waite.   New rumors crop up almost every week: He was killed trying toescape Shiite Moslem extremists who held him; he was smuggled toIran in a coffin to stand trial as an American spy; he will beransomed for $7 million.   No group has claimed to hold Waite. The British government, whichrefuses to negotiate with terrorists, says no demands have beenmade. No photographs or videotapes have been released to prove he isalive.   A British official said recently: ``We believe Waite is alivesimply because we've had no evidence to the contrary.''   Fifteen foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including nineAmericans, most of them believed held by Shiites loyal to Iran.   One of the Americans, on whose behalf Waite had intended tonegotiate, has been held longest: Terry A. Anderson, 41, chiefMiddle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnappedMarch 16, 1985.   The 49-year-old personal envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury isone of four Britons among the missing. Two seen grabbed by gunmen inBeirut _ journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, who hasBritish and Irish nationality _ also disappeared with no claims ofabduction.   Iran's recent effort to improve relations with Britain and otherWestern nations after a decade of self-imposed isolation has raisedhopes it will seek to have the hostages freed.   Waite's cousin, John Waite, said Wednesday in a CBS-TV interview:``What we're hoping is that President Bush ... can put the hostagequestion right to the top of his agenda.''   President-elect George Bush, who takes office Friday, said thisweek he does not believe Iran controls the Lebanese kidnap gangs butbelieves improved relations could help. Bush said his administrationwould seek ways to free the hostages.   President Reagan acknowledged Thursday that he leaves office``without a hint or a clue'' about the American hostages.   Sources in the Middle East who have been well-informed on earlierhostage releases report no significant movement toward more releasessoon.   Waite, the policeman's son who became the personal emissary ofArchbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, was seen leaving the seasideRiviera Hotel in Moslem west Beirut at 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 20, 1987,to meet with Shiite kidnappers.   He told his Druse bodyguards he did not want them to escort himto the clandestine meeting, whose site he did not disclose.   Sources said Waite was driven to the home of a Shiite physicianwho acted as middleman, where he apparently was to make contact withIslamic Jihad, a Shiite faction holding Anderson and ThomasSutherland, another American captive.   According to the sources, it was in the physician's house thatthe fate he often feared became reality: Waite himself was takenhostage.   Walid Jumblatt, leader of the the Druse militia guarding Waite,accused the Hezbollah, or Party of God, of holding Waite but theShiite fundamentalist group denied it.   On Thursday, he appealed for Waite's release in an interviewbroadcast by Lebanon's state television.   ``I do not think that Terry Waite is that big a spy. We shouldemerge from this whirlpool (of hostage taking),'' he said withoutelaborating.   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella organization for Shiitekidnappers, including Islamic Jihad, whose name means Islamic HolyWar.   Lebanese officials and some Western sources believe Waite'sposition was compromised by disclosure of the Reaganadministration's arms-for-hostages deal with Tehran.   Three American captives held by Islamic Jihad were freed afterU.S. weapons were delivered to Iran in 1985-86 during its war withIraq. Until the U.S. dealings with Tehran were disclosed in November1986, Waite was credited with obtaining their freedom.   Other reports say Islamic Jihad decided to make Waite a captivebecause it held him responsible for Kuwait's refusal to free 17pro-Iranians imprisoned there for bombing the U.S. and Frenchembassies and other targets in 1983. Their freedom had been thegroup's main demand.</TEXT></DOC>
