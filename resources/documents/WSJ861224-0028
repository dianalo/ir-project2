Mr. Aksler, of Teaneck, N.J., and his eight relatives, all of whom live in the same Brooklyn neighborhood, were accused of violating the anti-fraud and other provisions of securities laws, according to the SEC.    The SEC said Mr. Aksler and the other defendants are contesting the SEC's charges. Mr. Aksler couldn't immediately be reached yesterday for comment.    The agency identified the others as Mr. Aksler's brother-in-law, Moses Elias; Mr. Elias's four sons, Marcus, Chaskel, Solomon and Shulim, and three other relatives, David Fishman and his sons, Zev and Nachum.    The SEC said the five Eliases are employed as diamond dealers in New York.    The eight relatives took advantage of &quot;material nonpublic information&quot; about seven tender offers, a contemplated takeover bid and another corporate transaction, the SEC said. Although Mr. Aksler, as supervisor of tender-offer form files at Skadden Arps, was the conduit for the information, he didn't engage in insider trading, according to the agency's complaint.    Michael W. Mitchell, a Skadden Arps partner, said yesterday that the firm has been aware of the SEC investigation for &quot;quite some time&quot; and has &quot;cooperated fully.&quot; Mr. Mitchell added, &quot;If (Mr. Aksler) did do anything wrong, it was against absolutely clear firm policy not to utilize information for improper purposes.&quot;    At Skadden Arps, Mr. Aksler was responsible for computer storage and research of documents relating to tender offers and other transactions, the SEC complaint said. According to the agency, Mr. Aksler worked at the firm from February 1979 to July 1984.    Mr. Aksler's position, the SEC added, &quot;caused him to be entrusted with or enabled him to gain access to highly confidential information concerning possible acquisitions of numerous publicly traded companies or their securities.&quot;    In 1984, three former employees at Skadden Arps, one of the country's biggest law firms specializing in corporate takeovers, were the subject of a widely publicized insider-trading case. The workers -- two proofreaders and a computer operator -- admitted to trading on inside information stolen from the firm and sharing it with a former Prudential-Bache Securities broker, a taxi driver and the driver's girlfriend.    In addition, employees at two other major New York law firms recently have been charged with insider-trading. In July, a word-processor operator at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz was sentenced to six months in prison for sharing inside information gleaned from draft legal documents. In another case last year, an accounting clerk and a purchasing manager at Sullivan andamp; Cromwell each was sentenced to three years' probation for misappropriating information at that firm.    The number of relatives trading on Mr. Aksler's tips varied with the transaction, the SEC said. According to the agency, the largest profit, $127,605, was made in June 1983 with the purchase of 4,700 shares of Lenox Inc. stock shortly before Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. made its successful bid for the Lawrenceville, N.J.-based manufacturer of china and giftware.    Between August 1982 and July 1984, the SEC alleged, Mr. Aksler's relatives also profited from trades in the securities of Cities Service Co., General American Oil Co. of Texas, Texas Gas Resources Corp., Maryland Cup Corp., Simmonds Precision Products Inc., Tymshare Inc., Northwest Energy Co. and Houston Natural Gas Corp.    The agency asked the court to enjoin the defendants from violating the securities laws and to order them to give up their profits. </TEXT></DOC>
