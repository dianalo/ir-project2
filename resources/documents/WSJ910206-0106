Buck, theofficial Xinhua news agency said. Buck won the Nobel prizefor literature in 1938 for &quot;The Good Earth,&quot; her novel abouta Chinese peasant family.   Buck's missionary parents went to Zhenjiang, in coastalJiangsu province, in 1892, when she was an infant. She livedin China for 36 years.   No Chinese writer has won the Nobel prize, and its awardto Buck has been a sore point with Chinese authors. Her workshave been criticized as hostile to China for painting adismal picture of peasant life and portraying a governmentriddled with corruption. But at a symposium on her works lastmonth, Chinese intellectuals said that while her writingscontained biases and errors, they helped promote Sino-U.S.cultural exchanges.   Zhenjiang plans to convert Buck's home into a center forSino-U.S. exchanges and open it next year on her 100thbirthday.

Radio Russiawas banned last week from using the most popular radiofrequencies. The media have become a focal point of anapparent power-sharing struggle between Mr. Yeltsin andSoviet President Mikhail Gorbachev since the army's Balticscrackdown.                                                                                                          MANAGUA PREPARED TO DEAL   Nicaragua will propose forgoing its $17 billioncompensation claim for the alleged Central IntelligenceAgency mining of its ports in 1984 in exchange for anincrease in U.S. financial aid, an embassy spokesman said inWashington. A 1986 World Court ruling backed but didn'tspecify compensation for the then Sandinista regime, whichchallenged as illegal the U.S. support for Contra rebels andlinked it to mining of the ports. Washington rejected thecourt's jurisdiction.
