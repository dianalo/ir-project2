The No. 1 auto maker garnered praise from management analysts last April when it said it would scrap the cash part of its bonuses, and instead give restricted stock grants that couldn't be sold until &quot;a future point in time.&quot;    But, according to GM's 1988 proxy statement released Friday, one-third of that stock became vested -- or free from any barriers to sale -- in January, just one month after it was awarded.    &quot;If they give it to them and they let them exercise it in one month, I'm not sure what the long-term incentive would be,&quot; said Lance Berger, vice president and managing director of the reward practice section of Hay Group, a Philadelphia management consulting firm. &quot;It looks like a cash award.&quot;    A GM spokesman responded that &quot;there's no evidence that anybody would rush right out that day and sell everything they've got. . . . The fact that it isn't cash is the main thrust of the new approach.&quot; He added that the program &quot;more closely aligns incentive compensation with stockholder interests.&quot;    The proxy statement also contains the total compensation for GM's top officers, which lagged GM's 21% earnings increase in 1987 from 1986. Chairman Roger B. Smith received $1.7 million in salary, bonuses and a savings-stock purchase program, compared with $1.5 million in 1986. Robert C. Stempel, who became president during the year, made $1.1 million. His 1986 pay wasn't disclosed.    In addition, the top executives were granted options to buy GM stock at $81.69 a share. GM shares closed Friday at $72.75, up $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading; in the past year the stock has traded at a high of $94.125 and a low of $50 a share. In 1987, Mr. Smith exercised $513,121 of stock options and stock-appreciation rights and Mr. Stempel $73,523.    In 1986, in addition to salary and bonuses, the officials received payouts from a special performance-achievement plan. That plan generated earnings in 1987, but won't be paid out until this year.    In total, GM in 1987 distributed stock bonuses totaling $157 million, a sum devised by the board's compensation committee. Under the old formula scrapped last year, the total would have been 40% higher, the GM spokesman said.    But that sacrifice wasn't enough to satisfy the United Auto Workers union, whose GM members didn't get any profit-sharing payments last year. That's because their payout was pegged not to corporate-wide earnings but to the performance of the North American automotive group, which wasn't profitable in 1987.    The bonuses, said UAW President Owen Bieber in a prepared statement, were &quot;an insult to common sense and fairness . . . In this context of hard times and weak performance at GM, we believe the executives should forgo all increases and supplementary awards in the spirit of shared sacrifice.&quot;    Earlier last week, GM Executive Vice President Elmer W. Johnson told reporters he thought the GM system should be further changed so that management bonuses, like the hourly workers' profit sharing, should be tied to the performance of their specific unit. The proxy statement didn't disclose his pay.    However controversial, GM's compensation was anemic compared with that disclosed by Ford Motor Co. earlier in the week. Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen's $3.7 million salary and bonus for 1987 was more than double Mr. Smith's. Ford's profit was 28% higher than GM's in 1987, with 70% of the sales. It also paid workers an average of $3,700 in profit sharing. Chrysler Corp. is scheduled to release its proxy statement early this week.    When GM revamped its 70-year-old bonus plan last year, it said it wanted to &quot;shift the strategic orientation of GM's senior management to a more long-term business view.&quot; One way to accomplish that, according to the announcement, was giving out stock that was restricted.    However, the new system places no more limits on the stock than the old. Under both, the stock is given to executives in equal amounts over three years.    GM's spokesman said the plan still does increase the long-term incentive, because the awards in the second and third year are solely stock instead of half cash, as it was under the old system. That means executives now benefit more from a rising stock value.    The proxy statement also said that GM will ask shareholders at the annual meeting May 20 to approve changes in its pension plan for salaried employees, mirroring changes negotiated last year by the UAW for hourly workers. The agenda will also include consideration of shareholders' resolutions on topics ranging from greenmail to South Africa.    In addition, the proxy said that retired GM Chairman Thomas A. Murphy, 72 years old, will not run for re-election to the board, reflecting a change in the company's director-retirement policy. That policy previously had been amended to extend Mr. Murphy's tenure. The size of the board then will drop to 18 members. </TEXT></DOC>
