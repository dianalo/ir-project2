Richard M. Nixon did much the same thing in 1970.   The parallels between what U.S. forces and allied SouthVietnamese troops did in Cambodia in April 1970 and what Nicaraguanforces did in Honduras last week are not precise.   But the justification offered for the two actions 18 years apartis the same: that cross-border sanctuaries used by enemy forces tomake war are fair game for the country under attack.   In 1970, North Vietnam and South Vietnamese rebels were usingsanctuaries in eastern Cambodia to wage war against the U.S.-backedgovernment in Saigon.   On April 30 of that year, more than 20,000 U.S. and SouthVietnamese troops crossed the border into Cambodia to clear out thesanctuaries controlled by the North Vietnamese.   Now, almost 18 years later, Ortega has sent his forces intoHonduras, apparently for a similar purpose. According to U.S.estimates, upwards of 1,500 Nicaraguan forces, backed by air power,entered Honduras last Tuesday to wipe out resupply facilities ofthe Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   The Nicaraguan action prompted President Reagan, in response toa request from Honduran President Jose Azcona, to send 3,200 U.S.troops to Honduras in a show of American moral support. The troopsare under instructions to stay away from the area of hostilities.   Reagan's decision touched off demonstrations in several U.S.cities, much as Nixon's decision did 18 years ago on a much largerscale. Days after Nixon's announcement, four students were killedby National Guard troops at Kent State University.   George Carver, a former CIA analyst on Vietnam, said Friday itwould be a mistake to suggest that the Cambodian and Honduranexamples are analogous.   He said the Honduran bases are used by a Nicaraguan forceagainst the Nicaraguan government while, for the most part, thesanctuaries in Cambodia were used by North Vietnam to take over aforeign country, South Vietnam.   Carver, now an associate at the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies, a private research group, also recalled thatwhile Nixon acknowledged the offensive into Cambodia publicly,Ortega has not admitted the Nicaraguan foray into Honduras.   The Reagan administration has said that the evidence confirmingthe Nicaraguan presence there is beyond dispute.   In criticizing the Nicaraguan action this past week, Reaganadministration officials have said it constitutes a potentialdanger to Honduras, a country friendly to the United States.   Sidestepping the issue of the presence of Contra base camps inHonduras, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the decisionto dispatch U.S. forces was a show of support to a country whose``territorial integrity is being violated by the Cuban andSoviet-supported Sandinista Army.''   But there is no evidence that the short-term Sandinista goals inHonduras go beyond destruction of the Contra camps, just as theU.S. target in 1970 was not Cambodia but the communist sanctuariesthere.   ``We take this action not for the purpose of expanding the warinto Cambodia but for the purpose of ending the war in Vietnam,''Nixon said at the time.   There is another key similarity. Nixon felt he was justified ingoing after the North Vietnamese camps to strike a blow againstcommunist expansionism.   Ortega sees the Contras in much the same way that Nixon regardedthe North Vietnamese. The Contras, Ortega has said, are``mercenaries'' who serve American strategic aims.   A footnote: The American and South Vietnamese forces leftCambodia after a few weeks. U.S. troops were gone from SouthVietnam within three years and the North Vietnamese conquest wasachieved two years later. As for Cambodia, a communist regime tookpower in 1975 and killed an estimated 2 million Cambodians duringits extraordinarily bloody 3{-year rule. The country is now underVietnamese military occupation.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Gedda has covered foreign affairs for TheAssociated Press since 1968.</TEXT></DOC>
