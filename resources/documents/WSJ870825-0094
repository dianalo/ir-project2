However, losses were pared later in the day as some traders bought crude oil following reports that a U.S. warship fired warning shots at two unidentified ships in the Persian Gulf.    The Pentagon said the USS Kidd, escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers under U.S. flags, fired shots across the bows of two approaching fishing boats of undetermined nationality.    While several analysts expect further declines in the coming months, they also said prices could stabilize in the next few trading sessions.    Meanwhile, reflecting the bearishness in the market, several major U.S. oil companies lowered the price they pay for the leading grade of domestic crude oil.    However, gasoline consumers won't see a drop in prices at the pump unless the current slide in crude prices continues at least several more weeks, analysts said.    The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected Nicosia, Cyprus-based oil industry journal, reported that total OPEC production for this month is expected to reach about 19.7 million barrels a day -- or almost 20% more than the cartel's quota of 16.6 million barrels a day for the rest of the year.    Because of apparent quota violations by Iran and the United Arab Emirates, among others, the reported output is also about one million barrels more than OPEC's estimate of July production of 18.6 million barrels a day.    The report &quot;is potentially the most destabilizing market event since the Saudi policy change in late 1985,&quot; said Robert Boslego, executive vice president of Boslego Corp., a Winchester, Mass., oil consulting firm. In October 1985, the Saudis started a price war by flooding the market with oil, leading to a collapse of prices, which plunged to $10 a barrel from almost $30.    &quot;That level of production puts 2.2 million barrels of oil a day into inventories, lessening demand for OPEC oil,&quot; said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.    &quot;There will now be a test of OPEC unity,&quot; Mr. Rothman said, and the critical player will be OPEC's largest producer, Saudi Arabia.    Mr. Rothman and other analysts suggested that prices will fall further if the Saudis don't significantly restrain output next month.    However, some market specialists said that even if the Saudis restrain production, that probably won't be enough to stop a renewed price slide.    &quot;Here you have a case where the goals of individual (OPEC) producers are not similar to the goals of the group as a whole,&quot; Mr. Boslego said.    The report by the Middle East Economic Survey sent the October price of West Texas Intermediate, the bellwether U.S. crude, tumbling 30 cents a barrel to $18.60 in active trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. However, the closing price was up from the day's low of $18.15 a barrel.    Similar declines were posted in the spot, or noncontract, market. The spot price of West Texas crude for September delivery fell 10 cents a barrel to $19.20, while the spot price of North Sea Brent, an abundantly traded European crude, fell $1 a barrel to $17.30 in late trading.    It was the 12th drop in oil prices in the past 15 sessions; in that time, prices have tumbled $4.07 a barrel, or almost 18%, from the session high of $22.67 a barrel Aug 3. The last time the price was lower was April 23, when it closed at $18.59 a barrel at the New York Merc.    Although the recent drop has stemmed in part from industry talk about OPEC overproduction, the Middle East Economic Survey report indicated the output was greater than earlier estimated, analysts said.    Prices also fell yesterday as traders sold contracts to offset those bought earlier, brokers said. Some traders opened new long, or buying, positions late last week when prices were just above $19 a barrel, said Chris McCormack, an oil broker at E.D. andamp; F. Man International Futures Inc. in New York.    &quot;But when the market opened much lower, it sparked a new round of long liquidation,&quot; Mr. McCormack said.    However, many analysts expect prices to recover in the coming days.    The decline of the past three weeks &quot;has been one of the largest moves without a correction, and I'm expecting a consolidation in the next few days,&quot; Mr. McCormack said.    Still, he expects prices to tumble to near $16 a barrel in the coming months.    Meanwhile, some analysts suggested that the recent price drop has been exaggerated.    &quot;The market is just feeding on itself and will soon head back up to $20,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, futures trading adviser at Josephthal andamp; Co. in New York.    In the meantime, several major U.S. oil companies lowered the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate.    Exxon Co. U.S.A., Mobil Oil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., Amoco Oil Co., among others, lowered their posted prices 50 cents a barrel, to $19.50. And Sun Co., Phillips Petroleum Co., Koch Oil Co. and Southland Corp.'s Citgo Petroleum Corp., among others, lowered their posted prices 50 cents, to $19. </TEXT></DOC>
