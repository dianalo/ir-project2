Mrs. Santiago, a former judge, made the remark in response toRep. Mario Joaquin's claim in the House of Reprsentatives on Mondaythat the Commission on Immigration and Deportation was fraught withcorruption.   Mrs. Santiago said she wanted to challenge Joaquin ``to a fistfight'' to defend her reputation. There was no immediate responsefrom the congressman.   Since her appointment last year, Mrs. Santiago has cultivated areputation for honesty and efficiency in a bureaucracy riddled withgraft, corruption and inefficiency.   She once warned immigration officers at Manila airport that shewas aware of their corrupt practices and would cut them into smallpieces and ``feed you to the sharks in Manila Bay.''   She then added that the sharks would probably not devour theofficials out of ``professional courtesy.''   Critics, however, claim the commission is still corrupt and thatMrs. Santiago has run roughshod over employees to enhance herreputation and launch a political career.</TEXT></DOC>
