The drug, Synarel, is the first drug of its class to be approvedfor this condition. It will be marketed by Syntex Corp.   Synarel is administered as a nasal spray twice daily for sixmonths and works by stimulating and then suppressing production ofestrogen, which controls the growth of the endometrial tissue thatlines the uterus.   Endometriosis occurs when this tissue, which usually is shedmonthly with menstruation, migrates outside the uterus, most ofteninto the abdominal and pelvic region, where it swells and bleedsduring menstruation.   This tissue implants on the ovaries, the intestines and thefallopian tubes, where it can cause blockage and infertility.   Symptoms of endometriosis include severe menstrual cramps, painduring sexual intercourse, painful urination and painful bowelmovements.   Side effects of Synarel, which is nafarelin acetate, are thesame as problems associated with menopause, including hot flashes,vaginal dryness and, less commonly, decreased sex drive, Syntexsaid. A small loss of bone density also can occur, but most isrecovered after treatment is completed.   Currently, the most widely prescribed drug for treatment of thesymptoms of endometriosis is danazol, a derivative of a male sexhormone. Its side effects include weight gain, decrease in breastsize, deepening of the voice, acne, oily skin and unwanted hairgrowth.</TEXT></DOC>
