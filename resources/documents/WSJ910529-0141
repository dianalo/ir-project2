It was an unprecedented encounter, signaling changesin the relationship between Taipei and Beijing that may proveas important for Asia as the end of the Berlin Wall was forEurope.   Mr. Chen and 13 colleagues represented a new body calledthe Straits Exchange Foundation that Taipei has created todeal &quot;unofficially&quot; with Beijing, just as its CoordinationCouncil for North American Affairs deals &quot;unofficially&quot; withWashington. For Taipei, this is a promising move.</LP><TEXT>   It is essential that the U.S. watch these developmentsclosely and do all it can to foster their peaceful progress.For the possibility of conflict in the Taiwan Strait remainsreal, and could even increase if the cautious reconciliationbetween Taipei and Beijing fails. That reconciliation willproceed more smoothly if both China and Taiwan arefull-fledged members of the international community.President Bush's decision this week to extend, withrestrictions, China's most favored nation trading status isimportant in furthering that end. What is now needed aresteps to end Taiwan's isolation.   That Taipei cannot handle its key relationships withWashington and Beijing through regular diplomatic channels isa measure of just how severe its diplomatic setbacks havebeen over the past 20 years, as nation after nation hasderecognized it. Mr. Chen's visit, however, suggests thatthis process of marginalization is being reversed. The envoyfrom Taipei represents a government whose leverage andconfidence are increasing. The government of his Chinese hostis watching its once formidable international clout dwindle.   From this changing balance of power comes both promise andrisk. The promise is that Taiwan -- wealthy, militarilystrong and increasingly democratic -- will find theconfidence to compromise with China. The risk is that thegovernment of the People's Republic, beleaguered at home andincreasingly ignored internationally, will be unwilling toaccept Taiwan's best offer, and instead try for the wholecake.   The risk is intensified by the fact that competitionbetween Taiwan and the mainland is not just betweengovernments, but between two kinds of Chinese societies. Themeeting between C.V. Chen and Wu Xueqian suggests how muchthe psychological equation between the two Chinas hasshifted. On the vexing issue of whether Beijing is the&quot;central&quot; government and Taipei a &quot;local&quot; one, Mr. Chen saidthe issue is not one of territorial size or population but ofsystem. The choice, he said, has to be made by the Chinesepeople.   A decade ago most observers would have argued that theChinese people had already made their choice -- communism.But the democracy movement of 1989 showed that is not thecase, and the Tiananmen massacre showed how far the Chinesegovernment was willing to go to hold on to power. Talksbetween Taiwan and China present a diplomatic version of thesame set of issues.   Policy toward Taiwan (and also Hong Kong) is a bone ofcontention in internal Chinese politics. For hard-liners, theincorporation of both territories into the People's Republicon Beijing's terms is part of the oldtime religion ofcommunism. Hence increasing intervention in Hong Kong'saffairs and the unwillingness to drop the threat of forceagainst Taiwan. For reformers, Taiwan (and Hong Kong) aresources of capital, ideas and leverage. The reformers welcomecontacts, in the hope that they will push the mainlandforward, and are not particular about points concerning thestatus of governments, flags, etc. that regularly hang upnegotiations.   The strength of this second group in China is cause forlong-term optimism. But as long as it is stalemated byhard-liners, no decisive breakthrough in Taiwan-Chinanegotiations is likely. The longer the situation remainsunresolved, however, the greater the risk that things will gosour.   Thus there is a danger that frustration in negotiationswill strengthen extremists on both sides of the strait inways that could lead to confrontation. It is not hard toenvision nightmare scenarios. Suppose that Beijing, troubledby unrest at home, decided that some saber-rattling (say, ablockade) to &quot;liberate&quot; Taiwan was just the patriotic tonicChina needed? Or that elections in Taiwan produced agovernment that gave up on China and decided instead todeclare the island independent? Under such circumstancesBeijing has promised to respond with force.   No such scenario offers much comfort. Unlike Iraq, Chinais a nuclear power; unlike Kuwait, Taiwan can resist. TheU.S. and Japan would become involved.   These are not pleasant prospects, and enough peopleunderstand them well enough that they will probably beavoided. But they serve to remind us that what happensbetween China and Taiwan is not simply an Asian curiosity: Itis something in which the world has a stake.   Is there anything constructive the world powers can do?The key variable is internal politics on both sides of theTaiwan Strait, and in each case the threat comes from extremeor uncompromising positions. China is difficult to influence,but at a minimum we must strive to maintain contacts andconfidence -- such as MFN status. In Taiwan, the danger isthat a Taiwan isolated from the world community and unable tobe Chinese except on Beijing's terms will opt forindependence.   Avoiding this means bringing Taiwan back into the worldcommunity. The major powers should move to upgrade theirrelations with Taipei. They should support Taipei's entranceinto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They shouldinvolve Taipei in international economic and securityconsultations.   China is hostile to this approach. So are hard-liners inTaiwan. But it's the only way to strengthen the moderates onboth sides and help the world avoid some very real perils.   ---   Mr. Waldron is author of &quot;The Great Wall of China: FromHistory to Myth&quot; (Cambridge University, 1990).</TEXT></DOC>
