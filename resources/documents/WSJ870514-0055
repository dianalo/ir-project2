The Pentagon's anger has mounted since the U.S. learned that Kongsberg Vaapenfabrik, a state-controlled Norwegian company, teamed up with Japan's Toshiba Machine Co., a unit of Toshiba Corp., to sell the Soviet Union the know-how for making vastly quieter submarine propellers.    Indeed, the transactions, which occurred in 1983 and 1984, dominated luncheon discussions between Mr. Holst and U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who is here to attend a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's nuclear-planning group.    Investigations under way in both Norway and Japan indicate that the sale resulted from a falsification of licensing documents. Norwegian authorities have charged one former Kongsberg executive with fraud, and three others are under suspicion. Japan has hauled stacks of records out of Toshiba's offices in the course of its investigation.    U.S. officials applaud both investigative efforts, but some contend that reparations or economic sanctions against the companies might be needed as well. At the lunch with Mr. Weinberger, there was even talk of getting the Norwegians -- and presumably the Japanese -- to help the Navy pay for the anti-submarine research that will be necessary to recover the edge that was lost through the Kongsberg-Toshiba deal.    By all assessments, any such arrangement would be hard to thrash out. For fiscal 1988, which begins next October, the Navy is seeking $1.7 billion to research new ways of hunting and hiding from enemy submarines. How much of that research stems from the newly quiet Russian propellers is impossible to say. Besides, many improvements in Russian submarines can be traced to an American Navy man, John Walker, who peddled secrets to the Soviets for more than a decade.    A more likely possibility is a suspension of U.S. purchases from the two companies involved in the propeller deal. That would come at a bad time for Kongsberg. The company is financially strained already, and has shed many of its businesses, including the trading operation that helped sell the propeller technology. The changes have pared the company back to an arms maker, that, among other things, is counting on the chance of selling missiles to the U.S. Navy.    Norway's Mr. Holst says the missile sale &quot;has tremendous importance&quot; to the future of Kongsberg. The missiles, which are called Penguins, can also be made by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., which is vying for the job. Over the next ten years, the Penguin business could be worth more than $100 million to the winner, one U.S. official estimates.    According to Pentagon officials attending yesterday's lunch, the Norwegians gave &quot;assurances that they would instigate new procedures to prevent this from happening again.&quot; Some U.S. officials believe that those assurances, together with Norway's investigation, should be enough. &quot;This involved deliberate fraud,&quot; said one U.S. diplomat. &quot;Even the best system would have difficulty detecting it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
