<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-37-0528 </DOCNO><TEXT>The absolute measurements of thermal neutron fluence for fission trackdating have been developed after the proceeding results of Honda et al.(1987). The 2,200 m/sec activation cross section of /sup 197/Au (98.8barn) is corrected to 87.4 barn ({sigma}a) by the three factors of theneutron temperature, Maxwellian distribution of thermal neutrons andnon 1/v correction factor for the above absolute measurement. The calibratedfactor (B/sub th/) of standard glasses (SRM613, SRM962a, CN-1 and CN-2)and zeta-a (zetaa) values for fission track dating are determined onthe basis of these experimental results. The values of B/sub th/, (7.47+- 0.29) x 10/sup 9/ for SRM613, (7.43 +- 0.34) x 10/sup 9/ for SRM962a,(2.50 +- 0.06) x 10/sup 9/ for CN-1 and (2.74 +- 0.06) x 10/sup 9/ forCN-2 closely agree with those reported previously by Honda et al. (1987).Further, the zetaa values of 392.3 +- 16.5 for SRM962a and SRM613, 131.4+- 3.1 for CN-1 and 144.1 +- 3.3 for CN-2 calculated from B/sub th/,effective thermal neutron fission cross-section {sigma}f (497.4 barn),isotopic abundance ratio /sup 235/U//sup 239/U, I (7.2527 x 10/sup -3/)and spontaneous fission decay constant of /sup 238/U, {lambda}/sub f/(6.85 x 10/sup -17/a/sup -7/) show close agreement with zeta/sub b/ values(392.5 +- 10.0, 131.6 +- 3.3, 140.1 +- 3.5) derived from the absoluteage of Fish Canyon Tuff (27.9 +- 0.7 Ma) respectively. The fission trackdating of zircons separated from Oligocene-Miocene tuff distributed inEastern Hokkaido have been carried out by the external detector methodusing zeta/sub a/. The obtained ages are 28.6 +- 0.7 Ma (1 - 2) and 23.3+- 0.7 Ma (3 - 2). These results agree well with the geologic age supportedfrom Ashoro Fossil Fauna, K-Ar ages of volcanic rocks and stratigraphyin this area.</TEXT></DOC>
