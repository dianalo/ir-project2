Overwhelming evidence suggests that ... Camarena's kidnapping,torture and murder were masterminded by one Rafael Caro Quintero,reputed to be the boss of one of Mexico's five largest drugfamilies. After many delays, the wheels of justice are about tocatch up with this notorious drug kingpin. ...   Although the Mexican federal police considered him a primesuspect in ... Camarena's death, ... Caro Quintero was permitted toflee to Costa Rico four years ago after bribing the regional policecommander who headed the investigation.   Even after he was captured and imprisoned, he was treated morelike a visiting dignitary than a dangerous felon. His prison cellresembled a hotel suite, complete with room service and a telephonewith which to conduct his business. It was a travesty.   The Mexican government, which has repeatedly vowed to crack downon murderous drug dealers, can do just that by making an example of... Caro Quintero _ provided he is convicted. ...   Camarena's grieving family, which has been patiently waiting forhis killers to be punished, deserves at least that much.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 12   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on Mexico's corruption:   Toppling one reputed Mexican drug kingpin will only be valuableif it signals a long-term commitment by the Mexican government tofight corruption and drugs. Otherwise, the names will simply changeas the status quo continues.   It would clearly be in U.S. interests for Mexico to wage acontinued assault; a recent report by Secretary of State James A.Baker III cited Mexico as the United States' top source for heroinand its No. 2 source for marijuana.   But it is in Mexico's interests as well _ not just to winfavorable treatment over international debts and such, but becauseof the tremendous social and political costs of corruption. Allnations in which drugs have become big business must fear the sortof stranglehold that drug traffickers achieved over the Colombiangovernment.   Elements in the recent arrest of Miguel Angel Felix Gallardooffer the kinds of encouraging signs the United States has beenlooking for from Mexico.   In the past, Mexican government officials frequently haveresponded testily to U.S. charges of official corruption inconnection with drug trafficking. But (last) week, severalofficials were arrested, and Mexican Attorney General EnriqueAlvarez del Castillo discussed the corruption aspect.   Mexico's president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has frequentlyspoken out against drug trafficking.   But one of Mexico's frequent responses to criticism has beenthat it is the United States' consumer demand for drugs, especiallythe popularity of cocaine, that drives the trafficking.   In Mexico, it will take a great deal of political will _ andskill _ for President Salinas' anti-corruption efforts to succeedin the face of longtime practice. If they do work, however, theywill benefit both countries _ institutions and citizens alike.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 17   The Evening Sun, Baltimore, on needle-exchange programs:   (Baltimore) Mayor (Kurt) Schmoke was probably braced for apummeling when he told a Washington audience that he favoredexperimental needle-exchange programs for drug addicts as a way ofslowing the spread of AIDS.   Predictably, ... national drug director William J. Bennettobliged by jumping on Schmoke's remarks with both feet.   ``It very clearly muddies the message,'' Bennett said, becauseit sends an ``ambiguous and ambivalent'' message about drug use.   While that concern undoubtedly is widely shared, Bennett ishardly the one to complain about officials sending ``mixedmessages.''   As of last week he had not only snubbed D.C. Mayor Marion Barryby not including him in the announcement of new federal anti-drugefforts in the nation's capital, but also planned to excludeSchmoke from a meeting of local officials called ... to discussoverall policy in the Baltimore-Washington region.   How Bennett expected to run an effective regional campaignwithout the mayors of its two largest cities is anybody's guess.Ultimately even he was forced to recognize the inconsistency of hisposition and open the gathering to both Barry and Schmoke.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 14   The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel on the Eastern Airlines strike:   Watching the prolonged agony of Eastern Airlines is like seeingyoungsters bicker on shore while the family dog fights a losingbattle against a stream's strong current.   Not to liken Eastern to a dog, although despairing travelershave called it worse. But the latest failure of its ``family'' tosave the airline does smack of childishness.   Until (April 12) salvation seemed assured. ... Now it appears tobe too late for (Peter) Ueberroth. And it could be too late forEastern unless its family stops bickering.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 18   Honolulu Advertiser on the British soccer tragedy:   The weekend tragedy in Sheffield, England, which left anincredible 94 dead and more injured, is another black mark for thegood game of soccer.   The ugliness of fan hysteria in Britain and other countrieswhere soccer excites mindless rivalry contrasts sharply with thewholesome youth soccer being developed in America.   Here participants are many but spectators few and the big noiseon the sidelines is parents urging youngsters to greater toughness.   Wrong decisions by police were the immediate cause of theSheffield disaster, but poor stadium design and bad spectatorhabits were the larger culprits.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
