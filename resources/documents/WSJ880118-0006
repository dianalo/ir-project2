On Friday, the U.S. government charged the two Iranians with conspiring to violate export controls aimed at keeping weapons out of unfriendly or belligerent hands. The government said one of the suspects offered a $100,000 bribe to a military contractor and was willing to pay as much as $60 million for thousands of anti-aircraft missiles.    The Iranians, a Tehran importer and his son living in Cincinnati, were arrested by undercover agents in a Boston rail yard as they tried to complete a transaction for radar parts used in the Hawk anti-aircraft missile system. The Hawk was sold to Iran prior to the revolution in 1979; since then, its sale to Iran has been prohibited.    Government investigators and the maker of the parts said the thwarted attempt was one of a mounting number of efforts to illegally divert arms components from the U.S. to Iran. Investigators said the defendants took big risks and behaved almost recklessly in their efforts to procure the radar parts. They made no attempt to hide the destination of the goods they sought, were prepared to pay vastly inflated prices, and gave strong signals they were working with the full support of the Iranian government, investigators said.    &quot;I would say they were desperate,&quot; said Gary Crossen, the assistant U.S. attorney responsible for the Boston case.    Mr. Crossen said defense contractors in the Boston area have been reporting a growing number of approaches from foreign agents interested in exports without the necessary licenses. Varian Associates, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based company that makes the vacuum tubes sought by the Iranians for the Hawk, said it has had about 20 or 30 inquiries in the last year that it suspects were from Iranian intermediaries. All were referred to federal authorities.    The number of inquiries &quot;keeps growing as the parts wear out,&quot; a Varian spokesman said.    The defendants, arraigned in U.S. district court in Boston Friday, identified themselves as Ahmad Modarressi, 64 years old, and his son Majid, 29. Their arrests ended an elaborate &quot;sting&quot; operation involving U.S. Customs Service, the State Department, and Raytheon Corp., the Burlington, Mass.-based maker of the Hawk system.    Last October, the government said, Majid Modarressi contacted James Mullen, a Raytheon purchasing manager, and indicated he &quot;could use as many military spare parts as possible.&quot; A customs affidavit said Mr. Modarressi also indicated that he wanted &quot;unlimited quantities&quot; of Hawk missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, also made by Raytheon. Later, the government said, Mr. Modarressi modified his request for Stingers to 2,000 missiles.    The younger Mr. Modarressi offered Mr. Mullen $100,000 if he would sell the defense goods without an export license, the government said. He also said he had as much as $60 million to spend on missiles, according to government evidence.    Mr. Mullen reported the inquiry to U.S. authorities. A customs agent, posing as a Raytheon &quot;export control manager,&quot; continued negotiations with the Modarressis and persuaded them to come to Boston to close a deal for the Varian vacuum tubes at a price of $280,000. The four tubes have a list price of $160,000, Varian says.    The undercover agents and the Iranians negotiated a deal under which the Modarressis would pay for the tubes using a letter of credit from the Iranian National Bank in London, the government said. The equipment was to be delivered to Tehran via London in a private airplane. The elder Mr. Modarressi offered to arrange special clearance at Tehran airport for the plane using a secret code word known to authorities there, the U.S. attorneys said.    In the arraignment hearing on Friday, the Modarressis made no comment about the charges. </TEXT></DOC>
