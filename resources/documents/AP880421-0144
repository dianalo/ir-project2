The 4-3 ruling was a victory for injury victims and theirlawyers in cases where the harm had occurred but the lawsuits hadnot yet been completed by June 1986, when state voters approvedProposition 51 by a 62 percent majority.   One class of cases particularly affected by today's ruling isasbestos lawsuits, many of which had been filed but not settled byJune 1986.   The court ruled that the initiative was constitutional,rejecting trial lawyers' claims that it discriminated unfairlyagainst injury victims. But in the key portion of the ruling, themajority said the measure's new standards for determiningnon-economic damages applied only to injuries suffered after theinitiative passed.   The opinion by Justice John Arguelles cited ``the common-sensenotion that it may be unfair to change the rules of the game in themiddle of the contest.'' He also said new laws are generallypresumed to apply only to future cases.   Proposition 51, sponsored by businesses, insurers and localgovernments and opposed by trial lawyers, limits a defendant'sshare of non-economic damages _ pain, suffering and emotionaldistress _ to its percentage of the total fault.   Under the initiative, if a company that is 40 percentresponsible for an injury, for example, has gone out of business bythe time of suit, the victim can collect no more than 60 percent ofthe non-economic damages from the remaining defendants.   Economic damages, such as medical costs and lost wages, arestill covered by the longstanding ``deep pockets'' rule, underwhich one or all of the remaining defendants can be required to pay100 percent of the costs.</TEXT></DOC>
