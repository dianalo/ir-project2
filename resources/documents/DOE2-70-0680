<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-70-0680 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have previously published the techniques and preliminary results ofan SV40 viral probe assay for gamma-radiation-induced single- and double-strandDNA breaks and their intracellular repair in higher cells. Those experimentswith SV40 infected CV-1 monkey kidney cells suggested that this assaytechnique demonstrates slow but extensive intracellular repair of single-strandbreaks (SSB), and possible early repair of double-strand breaks (DSB),followed by later induction of DSB. Following up on these early observations,many additional infection-incubation experiments have now been performedwith both human and simian cells. Analysis of data from these experimentsinvolving up to 6 h of postinfection intranuclear incubation shows thesame distribution of strand break damage in incubated and unincubatedsamples. This implies that under these experimental conditions thereis neither intracellular repair nor further production of SSB or DSBin intranuclear viral DNA. We have evidence which suggests that thislack of repair or degradation occurs because the bulk of intranuclearSV40 DNA is relatively inaccessible to host cell enzymes.</TEXT></DOC>
