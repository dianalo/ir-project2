Also on the revised list of prosecution witnesses against thefired National Security Council aide is William Langton, presidentof Southern Air Transport, a former CIA proprietary involved in boththe Contra resupply operation and the administration's secret armssales to Iran.   The new names were on a list that actually contains fewer names,40 rather than 87, reflecting a motion by independent counselLawrence Walsh to dismiss the two central charges of conspiracy andtheft against North.   But at a hearing Monday, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell saidhe wouldn't dismiss the charges until Attorney General DickThornburgh explains the administration's refusal to declassifyinformation Gesell says must be released for North to get a fairtrial.   An interagency intelligence group in the Reagan administrationhas declined to declassify certain material in 300 prosecutionexhibits Walsh wants to present at trial, which forced Walsh to seekdismissal of the two central charges. Twelve charges remain.   Walsh said he is ``quite sure'' he can get an affidavit fromThornburgh and Gesell said he hopes to receive it by Thursday.   Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller declined to comment onwhether Thornburgh would supply an affidavit, but a departmentsource, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he assumed theattorney general probably will submit one.   Former U.S. Rep. Michael Barnes, newly on the prosecution witnesslist, in mid-1985 asked the NSC whether the staff was assisting theContras and requested all information pertaining to contact betweenNorth and rebel leaders.   North prepared then-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane'swritten response to the Democrat from Maryland, according to the twocounts in the indictment against North that charge him withobstruction of Congress and making false statements.   The response to Barnes said that ``none of us has solicitedfunds, facilitated contacts for prospective potential donors, orotherwise organized or coordinated the military or paramilitaryefforts of the resistance.''   Barnes at the time was chairman of the House subcommittee onwestern hemisphere affairs. In congressional testimony on theIran-Contra affair in 1987, North testified that ``I probably''helped draft McFarlane's response to Barnes, but that ``I don'trecall specifically, there were a number of these'' responses tocongressional inquiries.   The letter to Barnes accounted for one of the misdemeanor chargesof withholding information from Congress to which McFarlane pleadedguilty last March in the Iran-Contra affair.   Coors made the $65,000 contribution to the Contras after meetingwith North in 1985, less than three months before the letter toBarnes from the NSC.   Coors has said he met in June 1985 with then-CIA Director WilliamCasey, who referred Coors to North when Coors expressed an interestin giving money to the Contras at a time when U.S. military aid tothem was banned by Congress.   At a meeting in Casey's office in the old executive officebuilding next to the White House, the CIA director ``said OllieNorth is the guy to see,'' Coors said in 1987 in congressionaltestimony on the Iran-Contra affair.   Coors then walked over to see North, who said the Contras neededa Maule aircraft and gave Coors the number of a Swiss bank accountwhere he could send his contribution.   The account number was for Lake Resources Inc., part of the mazeof companies which Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, who also arecharged in the Iran-Contra case, used to funnel money to the Contrasfrom the administration's arms sales to Iran as well as from aprivate fund-raising network.   Coors arranged for $65,000 to be sent to the Lake Resourcesaccount and then contacted North, saying he had made it clear hewanted to give humanitarian, non-military aid to the Contras. Coorssaid North ``indicated that this plane would fit into that pattern.''   North denied in 1987 congressional testimony that he hadsolicited the funds, saying instead that Coors ``offered the money,and I told him where to send it.''</TEXT></DOC>
