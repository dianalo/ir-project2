Each school has a top official of the Securities and Exchange Commission as its leading proponent. Between them stands SEC Chairman David Ruder, who appears to have a foot in each camp.    The dominant school, at least among regulators and Democrats on Capitol Hill, believes that the plunge was exacerbated by big institutional investors who overwhelmed the market with sell orders. It holds that the best course is to slow down the trading of those investors. The easiest way to do that is to boost their transaction costs by raising margins in the futures markets, at least temporarily.    If this view prevails in the long run, lawmakers and regulators would be more likely to emphasize interventionist solutions that focus on inhibiting trading, damping speculation and even closing the markets occasionally.    The other school, more favored outside Washington than in it, argues that Oct. 19 was essentially a panic caused by a lack of information. This school dismisses the first as wanting to throw &quot;sand in the gears&quot; of the financial markets, and says the best remedy is to improve their information systems.    The most visible proponent of the information theory is SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest, an outspoken free-marketer who said yesterday that during the crash, &quot;people who wanted to trade often didn't have very good information. They weren't exactly sure they wanted to put their capital at risk in a rapidly moving market&quot; where they often couldn't obtain timely and accurate information about pricing, trade executions and the credit-worthiness of other traders.    &quot;We could pass every rule, every regulation in the book, and there's no way we could change the way investors react to fundamental changes in the environment, to changes in investor psychology,&quot; Mr. Grundfest told a recent symposium on the markets. &quot;The worst thing the government can do in that area is believe it can change that type of fundamental market reaction.&quot;    Calling the crash &quot;a set of information failures,&quot; Mr. Grundfest said recently that improving available data about, for example, the credit-worthiness of major market participants &quot;will very substantially decrease the probability of a repetition of Oct. 19 and 20.&quot;    But at a meeting of securities lawyers here last weekend, Richard Ketchum, chief of the SEC's market regulation division, said that argument misses the point. The prime lesson to be drawn from the crash, he said, is that the changed behavior of institutions in recent years -- such as trading multimillion dollar baskets of stocks -- set up the market for a fall.    Without mentioning Mr. Grundfest by name, Mr. Ketchum dismissed the information theory as at best misguided. &quot;If you're looking at what increased the velocity of the market, it's not a lack of communication between markets, it's not that there weren't linkages and arbitrages, it's the fact that institutional trading patterns had dramatically altered in the last three years,&quot; he said. &quot;The rest of it is just fog.&quot;    Standing between those two forceful advocates is SEC Chairman Ruder. In congressional testimony last month, for example, he called for changes that would retard market velocity and volume during crises and improvements in the market's capacity, such as better systems for trading and for conveying accurate data on trades and market participants.    Asked in a brief interview recently if he feels torn between the two schools and the two men, Mr. Ruder said, &quot;absolutely not. I have always believed in the free market, and I have always believed in regulation. My philosophy has always been that one ought to let the free market operate until it operates in a way you don't want it to.&quot; Then, he said, &quot;you may have to intervene.&quot;    Mr. Ruder and others at the SEC note that the two schools aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. Mr. Ketchum himself, after denouncing the information theory, said, &quot;We agree with most things that Commissioner Grundfest says.&quot; Increasing capacity, for example, would enable the markets to better absorb institutional trading pressure.    At the moment, Mr. Ketchum said, the main difference appears to be over whether margins should be increased in the futures markets, which actually lie beyond the SEC's jurisdiction.    Similarly, Mr. Grundfest said he agrees with much of Mr. Ketchum's analysis of the market crash. But he vigorously contests the idea of increasing the cost of trading. &quot;Transaction costs were much higher in 1929 than they are now,&quot; Mr. Grundfest argued. &quot;That says a lot about the extent to which higher transaction costs can stop the market from going down.&quot;    Another commissioner, Edward Fleischman, argues that there is a continuum between the two schools, and that the SEC should be looking both at how to discourage behavior that harms the markets and at how to encourage behavior that aids them, such as ways to ensure that firms that trade large blocks remain active in the market during times of crisis.    Yet the basic sympathies of Mr. Fleischman and a third commissioner, Charles Cox, seem to lie with Mr. Grundfest. On the five-member SEC, those three could quickly make the information theory the majority view of the commission, if not the staff.    If so, the SEC could run into a buzz saw on Capitol Hill. In a little-noted comment earlier this week, Rep. John Dingell, the powerful chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the SEC, bluntly said that improved systems aren't the answer to the market's problems.    &quot;There comes a point where efficiency ceases to carry affirmative benefits and instead becomes a highly destructive force,&quot; the Michigan Democrat said. &quot;We are at that point.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
