One of its major tasks this year is to aid the politicalopposition coalition poised to take on Nicaragua's leftistSandinista government in elections scheduled for February.   Such moves are not new for the NED, which playedbehind-the-scenes roles in support of political movements inPoland, Chile and the Philippines, and was recently accused ofpartisan politics in Costa Rica.   In Nicaragua, ``It's the only way to help Mrs. (Violeta)Chamorro and the opposition to assure a reasonable shot at free andfair elections,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater quotedPresident Bush as saying while Congress considered $9 million inassistance that was eventually approved to help the Nicaraguanopposition.   The NED charter, however, says ``no endowment funds ... may beused to finance the campaigns of candidates for public office.''   To reconcile that apparent conflict, endowment officials saythey are not helping Mrs. Chamorro but rather Nicaragua'sdemocratic coalition _ and that Mrs. Chamorro just happens to bethe coalition's candidate to replace Nicaraguan President DanielOrtega.   ``If we're not going to enter into those situations _ supportingdemocratic groups _ we would not be doing our job,'' says NED'spresident, Carl Gershman.   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., an endowment supporter, says theNicaraguan project ``approaches the line, but it doesn't crossit.'' He says the money will go to the ``campaign infrastructure''but acknowledges that Mrs. Chamorro ``will derive a considerableindirect benefit.''   Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., an NED critic, counters thatAmericans ``would be very annoyed if the Soviet Union, Japan or anyother country contributed money into our electoral system.''   ``In fact, it's illegal in our country,'' Kanjorski said. ``Whatwe do is make a very negative impression with Yankee money.''   Congress established the NED in 1983 ``to strengthen democraticinstitutions throughout the world through private, non-governmentalefforts.'' The programs are funded through annual congressionalappropriations.   The group's birth, according to a 1984 study by the GeneralAccounting Office, was a reaction to ``public disclosure of theCIA's covert funding of overseas activities of some privatevoluntary organizations.'' The idea was to take the shroud offpromoting democracy and free enterprise and operate much the waythe Soviets push socialism.   Yet the NED, at times, has become involved in countries thatalready are acknowledged democracies. An endowment program in CostaRica, a democracy for 100 years, was canceled recently afterdisclosure that it was aiding a group linked to the politicalopposition of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.   The NED charter says it may not ``pick and choose among thedemocratic competitors.'' Solarz says the Costa Rican program was amistake but that he is pleased that the NED acted to halt it afterit was publicized.   Most of the endowment's programs are less controversial. For thepast five years it has sent money to such farflung places asBotswana and Turkey. Last year's $16.8 million budget included$40,000 for publication of a Vietnamese magazine focusing on themerits of democracy. Another $140,000 went for leadership trainingcourses in Brazil.   Congress last year approved $1 million to be channeled throughthe NED for voter registration and polling in Chile's plebiscite inwhich the majority of Chileans voted ``no'' to continuing theAugusto Pinochet dictatorship.   Endowment programs, for the most part, are developed by four``core grantees:'' the AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Institute, theU.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for International PrivateEnterprise, and matching ``Institutes for International Affairs''linked respectively to the Republican and Democratic parties.Projects are approved by the NED's bipartisan board of directors.   Eugenia Kemble, head of the AFL-CIO group, recalls the earlierdays of CIA intervention and says the NED offers an alternative _ a``positive American presence that contrasts to ... what was donecovertly.''   Kanjorski, however, opposes the whole idea of giving U.S.government money to foreign groups under the guise of a privateorganization.   ``We don't have enough money now to operate our government,'' hesaid.   He especially objects to the Nicaraguan project, saying: ``If itdoesn't violate the law, it should violate the intent.''   NED funding for Nicaraguan opposition groups rose from $455,000in 1987 to $807,000 for the year ending last Sept. 30. Thousands ofdollars in NED aid to the oppostion newspaper, La Prensa, causedNicaraguan government supporters to dub it ``the CIA paper.''   Gershman promises strict controls to insure the money is used inNicaragua to educate the populace about balloting and promote thedemocratic process. Once final program outlines are completed, theNED and the core grantees will sign contracts with Nicaraguanpolitical opposition leaders.   The pro-Sandinista media in Nicaragua contend that the moneywill be used simply to buy votes. Two successive Republicanadministrations have been attempting to depose the Sandinistassince 1981.   J. Brian Atwood, president of the Democrats' arm of the NED,says, ``We don't care who wins.'' But he questions the amount ofU.S. money earmarked for the Nicaraguan vote, saying it reflects aRepublican ``obsession'' with the country.   Last year, NED sponsored 171 programs. The biggest singleamount, almost $2 million, went to bolster the once-banned PolishSolidarity trade union, which emerged as a political party andscored a major electoral victory earlier this year against thecommunist government.   Despite the Polish effort, which has had broad support from U.S.labor unions and both Republicans and Democrats, Ms. Kemble andother NED supporters acknowledge that the endowment has made somemistakes.   In 1985, Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., told Congress the endowmentsecretly funneled money to groups actively opposed to the Frenchgovernment. He called NED ``a loose cannon.''   A year earlier, NED had contributed some $20,000 to a Panamanianlabor union which put the money into the campaign of a presidentialcandidate backed by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   A sign of the changing tides in American foreign policy camelast year, when NED gave $55,000 to help a staunchly anti-Noriegagroup.</TEXT></DOC>
