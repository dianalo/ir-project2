In order to carryout these activities, CORECT needs a close liaison with the U.S. renewableenergy industry. The Solar Energy Industries Association, the nationaltrade association of the photovoltaic and solar thermal manufacturers andcomponent suppliers, is the only organization that represents the exportinterests of this segment of the U.S. renewable energy industries. Therefore,the unsolicited grant application is being accepted by DOE because it knowsof no other organization which is conducting or planning to conduct thesetypes of export assistance activities. The Project period for the grant is a one year period, expected to beginin September 1989.
