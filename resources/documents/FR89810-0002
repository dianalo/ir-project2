The disease is caused by afungus which reduces the quality and yield of wheat, oats, barley, andrye crops by robbing host plants of food and water. The fungus lives ona variety of host plants that are species of the genera <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia, </T3>and can spread from host-to-host by way of wind-bornespores.The regulations were originally issued as part of a cooperative federal-stateblack stem rust eradication program. The eradication phase of the cooperativeprogram officially ended in 1981. However, APHIS agreed to continue thequarantine on the basis that the states perform nursery inspections todetect whether any rust-susceptible varieties are present.On April 28, 1989, we published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 18288-18296, Docket No. 88-118), a documentproposing to completely revise the regulations by removing the eradicationarea provisions and adding provisions authorizing the Administrator todesignate states or counties as protected areas if they meet certain criteria,and by setting forth conditions governing the interstate movement of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia. </T3>Under the proposed rule, interstate movement of all <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>would be allowed from, to, and between non-protected areaswithout restriction. Rust-resistant varieties would be allowed to moveinto or through protected areas if accompanied by a certificate verifyingthat the plants are rust resistant. Interstate movement of rust-susceptible<T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>into or through protected areas would be prohibited, exceptwith a limited permit (which would be issued under narrow circumstances,as described in the regulations). The protected areas would be responsiblefor issuing the certificates required for interstate movement, and forinspecting every plant nursery within the state at least once each yearto ensure that they are free of rust-susceptible plants.We are adopting the provisions of the proposed rule based on the reasonsset forth in the proposal and in this supplementary information section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>Our proposal invited the submission of written comments postmarked or receivedon or before May 15, 1989.We received 10 comments addressing the proposed rule that were timely.Two of the comments were from nurseries. The other comments we receivedwere from state Departments of Agriculture for the following states: Colorado,Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wyoming.Both nurseries supported our proposal but added that the quarantine couldsafely be lifted even in grain producing areas since no commercially producedbarberry plants pose any threat to grain crops in the United States. Wedisagree with the two commenters. Although many grains grown in the UnitedStates today are resistant to existing races of the black stem rust organism,spores from different black stem rust organisms hosted by rust-susceptiblevarieties of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>may combine, resulting in new strains of black stem rustcapable of successfully attacking small grain crops. We believe it is necessaryto maintain restrictions on the interstate movement of host plants in orderto protect small grain crops from this risk.Of the 8 states that commented on the proposed rule, 5 generally supportedthe proposal and 3 opposed allowing any interstate movement of rust-susceptiblevarieties.Those states generally in favor of the proposed changes also noted theneed for APHIS to compile and publish reference materials, such as trainingmaterials and illustrated guides for the identification of susceptibleand resistant varieties, for use by the states in enforcing the regulations.Both the Central Plant Board and the Eastern Plant Board have adopted resolutionsto this effect. The materials currently issued by APHIS for use in identifyingvarieties of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>include most plants of these genera, however they needto be updated to include the newer varieties that have been identifiedas rust-resistant or rust-susceptible since those materials were last published.We are requesting that funds be authorized for this effort in the comingfiscal year so that we may prepare and issue revised materials to assistin detecting and identifying these regulated articles.The commenters generally supportive of the proposed changes also raisedthe following concerns:The Kansas State Board of Agriculture stated that contrary to our statementin the supplementary information accompanying the proposed rule (see 54FR 18288), varieties of small grains are being grown in the United Statestoday that are not resistant to black stem rust. Rather, the small grainsthat have been developed and that are being grown today mature earlierand are exposed to wind-borne black stem rust spores at a more advancedstage of development. As a result, they are less affected by the organism.Because of the lessened economic impact of black stem rust on current graincrops, the comment noted that some wheat breeders are not including blackstem rust resistance in their breeding programs and should. We agree thatit would be to their benefit to do so; however, we do not regulate wheatbreeding programs.The Department of Agriculture for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania commentedthat requiring inspection of the area within one-half mile of a nurserygrowing any rust-resistant plants of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>from seed is excessive. The comment stated that inspectingthe area within one-quarter mile of such a nursery is adequate. APHIS'sBiological Assessment and Support Staff has determined that a distanceof 300 meters will protect plants from pollination by unwanted spore types.The one-half mile distance proposed is equal to twice that distance plusan additional ten percent of that distance. As explained in the supplementaryinformation accompanying the proposed rule, we believe that because theseeds may be wind-borne, the half mile inspection requirement adds a desirablemargin of safety against the germination of new rust-susceptible varietiesnear the nursery. No change is made in the final rule as a result of thecomment.Pennsylvania also commented that in addition to USDA testing for rust susceptibilityof <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>plant varieties, USDA should continue to identify blackstem rust races and the geographic areas where they occur. The AgriculturalResearch Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture provides the serviceof identifying new strains of black stem rust. Information concerning identificationof black stem rust races may be obtained by writing to the AgriculturalResearch Service, Cereal Rust Laboratory, University of Minnesota, St.Paul, Minnesota 55108, attention: Alan Roelfs.South Dakota commented that while states have authority to stop intrastatesales or regulated articles for violations of state regulations, APHISmust impose and enforce penalties for interstate movements of regulatedarticles that violate the regulations. Although the proposed regulationsdo not impose penalties for violations, they do provide enforcement mechanismsthat may be invoked by those states that are designated as protected areasor that encompass protected areas, and by APHIS, in non-protected areas.The proposal provides that a certificate that has been issued for interstatemovement of regulated articles may be withdrawn if the certificate holderfails to comply with the regulations. Under the proposal, regulated articlescannot be moved into or through a protected area without the required certificate.The certificates are federal documents; however, under the terms of theproposed rule and in accordance with a cooperative arrangement with thosestates that are designated as protected areas, state employees would beauthorized to issue and withdraw the certificates in protected areas. Theproposal also provides that a compliance agreement between a state thatis a protected area or that encompasses a protected area may be cancelledby an inspector for noncompliance. Under the regulations as proposed, andin accordance with the memorandum of understanding an inspector includesany person, including state employees, authorized by the Administratorto enforce the regulations.South Dakota commented that all the northern wheat producing states shouldbe included in the protected area, and, accordingly, Wyoming and Coloradoshould be included as protected areas.In its comment to us, Wyoming's Department of Agriculture requested thatWyoming be designated as a protected area and added to andSection; 301.38(c)(1)if the regulations are adopted as a final rule. The Administrator believesthat Wyoming, currently listed as an ``Eradication area'' under andSection;301.28-2a, meets the criteria set forth in the proposed rule for a stateto be designated as a protected area. Therefore, we will publish in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>, for public comment, a document proposing toadd Wyoming to the regulations as a protected area.Colorado does not meet the criteria to be designated as a protected area,however, and has not requested to be so designated. Colorado does not maintaina program regulating the growth or intrastate movement of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>and, under the criteria set forth in andSection; 301.38-3,is ineligible for ``protected'' status.In addition to its request to be designated as a protected area, Wyomingexpressed opposition to our proposal claiming that the proposed changeswould result in the rapid reintroduction of rust-susceptible varietiesof <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>into the state, even if it is designated as protected.This reintroduction would occur as a result of private movement of rust-susceptiblevarieties between Colorado's retail discount nursery trade and residentsof Wyoming's wheat producing area, owing to the large price differentialbetween Wyoming nursery stock and Colorado-grown nursery stock. The commentstated that APHIS and the protected areas could not assure that the protectedareas would be safe from the reintroduction of rust-susceptible varietiesthrough illegal acts or negligence, and that once sold to retail customersthe plants' movement becomes virtually impossible to track.Allowing retail sales of susceptible varieties in nearby non-protectedstates would result in reinfestation of adjacent protected areas throughretail sales, according to Wyoming's Department of Agriculture. For thesereasons, Wyoming stated that it is completely opposed to allowing interstatemovement of rust-susceptible <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>anywhere in the United States. The comments we receivedfrom the Departments of Agriculture for Nebraska and Missouri shared thisview.We do not agree. We do not believe there is any economic risk in allowingthe interstate movement of rust-susceptible varieties of <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>to, from, or through non-wheat producing areas, and thatthis movement need not be restricted. The regulations, as proposed, provideeffective safeguards against the reintroduction of rust-susceptible <T3>Berberis, Mahoberberis, </T3>and <T3>Mahonia </T3>into the protected areas. Interstate movement of rust-susceptibleplants is prohibited, except in non-protected areas. In order to ensurethat only rust-resistant varieties are moved interstate into or throughprotected areas, the regulations require that they be moved interstateonly if accompanied by a certificate, issued upon inspection of the regulatedarticles or in accordance with the terms of a compliance agreement. Wyoming'sparticular concerns should be allayed upon qualifying to be designatedas a protected area. No change is made in the final rule on the basis ofthese comments.The Colorado Department of Agriculture commented that even if the proposedregulations would not jeopardize the eradication efforts of the protectedstates, APHIS should provide the support needed to conduct the activitiesnecessary to be designated as a protected area. These activities includenursery inspections and the issuance of the certificates required for interstatemovement of regulated articles. We do not agree with this comment. APHISconcluded its eradication efforts in 1981. At that time, the states thatwere designated ``Eradication areas'' in the regulations agreed to continuethe nursery inspection program under the cooperative federal-state blackstem rust program, in order to ensure that rust-susceptible varieties werenot reintroduced into the state. On that basis, APHIS agreed to continuethe quarantine. Under the proposed rule, in order to be designated as protectedareas, states must be responsible for issuing and withdrawing certificatesand enforcing compliance agreements. We do not believe it is appropriateor necessary to promote the effective implementation and enforcement ofthe regulations to shift responsibility for these activities to APHIS.Nebraska's Department of Agriculture requested clarification as to whetherthe certificates that would be issued under proposed andSection; 301.38-5would be federal or state certificates, and as to whether certificatesmust be issued for interstate movement of regulated articles from nurseriesthat are not propagating the material, but are only raising plant materialoriginating from other nurseries (presumably outside the protected area).The certificates required for interstate movement of regulated articlesin protected areas are federal documents. Under the proposed regulationsand the cooperative arrangement with states having protected areas, stateemployees would be authorized to issue and withdraw certificates. Suchcertificates must be issued for <T3> any </T3>interstate movement of <T3>any </T3>regulated articles moved interstate into or through a protectedarea, in accordance with the regulations.On the basis of the foregoing, we are not making any changes in the finalrule as a result of the comments we received, except to clarify that statepersonnel in states having protected areas are responsible for issuingand withdrawing certificates. However, a separate document will be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> proposing to add Wyoming as a protected area.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Federal restrictions on interstate movements of plants and plant partsof<T3> Berberis, Mahoberberis,</T3> and<T3> Mahonia</T3> are limited to a protected area that includes 15 statesand part of a sixteenth. The principal group affected by this final ruleconsists of nursery growers of the regulated articles,<T3> Berberis, Mahoberberis,</T3> and<T3> Mahonia.</T3> We are not changing the effect of the substantive interstatemovement restrictions applicable to growers within this protected areafrom those of the current regulations, and therefore, they will not beaffected by this revision of the regulations.In the non-protected areas, growers will be able to sell and transportinterstate, to non-protected areas, all varieties of<T3> Berberis, Mahoberberis,</T3> and<T3> Mahonia</T3> without certification or inspection requirements. Somepotential benefit may run to nursery growers in the non-protected areas,since such interstate sales of rust-susceptible varities would be allowedwithin those areas. Also, the waiting period applicable to new varietiesof<T3> Berberis</T3> is eliminated for articles moving only in the non-protectedareas. This relieves certain growers from the monetary losses resultingfrom developing new hybrids which are subsequently found to be rust-susceptible,and therefore may only be sold intrastate in non-eradication areas underthe existing regulations.Based upon Small Business Administration (SBA) statistics and the 1982Census of Agriculture statistics, the most recent statistics availableto us, we estimate that 71 percent of the 13,217 growers of nursery productsin the United States (9,384), are located in the non-protected areas, andthat 29 percent (3,833) are in the protected areas. Our projections indicatethat of this total, 96 percent are small businesses, as classified by theSBA in its Standards (those with $500,000-or-less in annual receipts).As we stated in the supplementary information accompanying the proposedrule (see 54 FR 18292), we do not have statistics indicating the numberof small nursery growers dealing in plants of the restricted genera andthe proportion of their revenues derived from such plants. Nevertheless,we believe that most growers of nursery products grow rust-resistant varietiesprimarily, so they can sell them to a broader market and ship interstate.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
