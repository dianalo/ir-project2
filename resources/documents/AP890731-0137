Col. William R. Higginswas hanged by his pro-Iranian captors inspired outrage around theworld Monday and criticism of Israel's abduction a Moslem cleric,which caused the retaliation.   Condemnation came from countries as ideologically different asBritain and Syria.   Foreign Secretary John Major said in London that, if the reportswere true, ``this is coldblooded murder, brazen savagery of theworst sort and quite unforgivable.''   Syria, which supported Iran in its war with Iraq, said:``Killing Higgins, who was not guilty of anything, is a crime thatviolates all humanitarian principles and norms.''   The American Marine's kidnappers, who call themselves theOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth, said they killed him inretaliation for Israel's abduction from south Lebanon on Friday ofSheik Abdul Karim Obeid.   Israel has offered to trade him and other Shiite prisoners forthree Israeli soldiers and other foreign hostages held in Lebanon.   Timur Goksel, spokesman for U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon,said ``If it's true it's one of the saddest days for allpeacekeepers in the world.'' Higgins commanded a group of U.N.truce observers in south Lebanon when he was seized Feb. 17, 1988.   Iran did not comment immediately after the report, but a leadingofficial earlier had defended the kidnappers' threats to killHiggins.   ``It is very natural that the Islamic clergy ... and militantgroups throughout the world will take action against the interestsof Israel and the United States,'' Interior Minister Ali AkbarMohtashemi told reporters.   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said: ``The threat againstHiggins has nothing to do with us. ... We condemn any kind ofkidnapping or death threat,'' he said.   Many officials questioned the veracity of the claim Higgins hadbeen killed Monday, which was accompanied by a poor-qualityvideotape showing a man hanging from a scaffold. There have beenreports that his captors killed the American last year.   ``If it is true, the news of the murder of Col. Higgins can onlyinspire a sentiment of horror,'' the French Foreign Ministry saidMonday.   Nasouh Majali, Jordan's information minister, said ``This ishorrible.'' Before the report that Higgins had been killed, Majalicalled the abduction of Obeid ``an act of terror.'' He said theIsraelis ``are condemning terror and they are using the samemeans,'' he said.   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson of Sweden said killing Higginswas ``a heinous crime'' that should be condemned along with Obeid'sabduction.   The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution that``condemns unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking and abduction.''   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar expressed ``outrageand revulsion ... that an innocent man, serving the United Nationsin the cause of peace, should be murdered in this fashion.''   On Saturday, Perez de Cuellar had the Obeid kidnapping. He andArchbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie have urged that Obeid befreed.</TEXT></DOC>
