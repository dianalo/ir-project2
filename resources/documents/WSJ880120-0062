Texas Eastern's Algonquin Gas Transmission Co. subsidiary proposed $600 million in pipeline projects, including construction of a 274-mile pipeline from the Canadian border near Waddington, N.Y., to Deerfield, Mass., which would transport 452 million cubic feet of Canadian and U.S. gas daily.    Algonquin also would transport almost 200 million cubic feet a day for Penn-East Gas Services Co., a general partnership of subsidiaries of Texas Eastern and Pittsburgh-based Consolidated Natural Gas Co. Texas Eastern and Consolidated have sought FERC permission for several other pipeline proposals for the Northeast.    Transco's Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. unit, in a joint proposal with two subsidiaries of New York-based National Fuel Gas Co., seeks permission to construct a $92 million pipeline capable of transporting 125 million cubic feet of gas a day from Canada through its system in the Northeast. National Fuel also would provide a storage service capable of providing an additional 100 million cubic feet of gas a day. Transco also proposes $181 million in current system expansion, which would allow it to increase deliveries by as much as 460 million cubic feet a day. </TEXT></DOC>
