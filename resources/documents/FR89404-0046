Mask worksare defined in 17 U.S.C. 901(a)(2) as:<ITAG tagnum="20">a series of related images, however, fixed or encoded</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional patternof metallic, insultating or semiconductor material present or removed fromthe layers of a semiconductor chip product; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) In which series the relation of the images to one another is thateach image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductorchip product.</ITAG>Chapter 9 further provides for a 10-year term of protection for originalmask works measured from their date of registration in the U.S. CopyrightOffice, or their first commercial exploitation anywhere in the world. Maskworks must be registered within 2 years of their first commercial exploitationto maintain this protection.Foreign mask works are eligible for protection under this chapter underbasic criteria set out in section 902; first, that the owner of the maskworks is a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of a foreign nationthat is a party to a treaty providing for the protection of the mask worksto which the United States is also a party, or a stateless person whereverdomiciled; second, that the mask work is first commercially exploited inthe United States; or that the mask work comes within the scope of a Presidentialproclamation. Section 902(a)(2) provides that the President may issue sucha proclamation upon a finding that:<ITAG tagnum="20">a foreign nation extends to mask works of owners who are nationalsor domiciliaries of the United States protection (A) on substantially thesame basis as that on which the foreign nation extends protection to maskworks of its own nationals and domiciliaries and mask works first commerciallyexploited in that nation, or (B) on substantially the same basis as providedunder this chapter to mask works (i) of owners who are, on the date onwhich the mask works are registered under section 908, or the date on whichmask works are first commercially exploited anywhere in the world, whicheveroccurs first, nationals, domiciliaries, or sovereign authorities of thatnation, or (ii) which are first commercially exploited in that nation.</ITAG>Although this chapter generally does not provide protection to foreignowners of mask works unless the works are first commercially exploitedin the United States, it is contemplated that foreign nationals, domiciliaries,and sovereign authorities may obtain full protection if their nation entersinto an appropriate treaty or enacts mask works protection legislation.To encourage steps toward a regime of international comity in mask worksprotection, section 914(a) provides that the Secretary of Commerce mayextend the privilege of obtaining interim protection under chapter 9 tonationals, domiciliaries and sovereign authorities of foreign nations ifthe Secretary finds:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) that the foreign nation is making good faith efforts and reasonableprogress toward_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) entering into a treaty described in section 902(a)(1)(A), or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) enacting legislation that would be in compliance with subparagraphs(A) or (B) of section 902(a)(2); and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) that the nationals, domiciliaries and sovereign authorities ofthe foreign nation, and persons controlled by them, are not engaged inthe misappropriation, or unauthorized distribution or commercial exploitationof mask works; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) that issuing the order would promote the purposes of this chapterand international comity with respect to the protection of mask works.''</ITAG>On March 7, 1989, a petition for the issuance of an interim order under17 U.S.C. section 914 was submitted to the Commissioner by the AustrianPatent Office on behalf of the Austrian Government. The petition, in theform of a letter from Dr. Josef Fichte (President of the Austrian PatentOffice) and a copy of the Austrian Federal Law of June 23, 1988 on theProtection of the Topographies of Microelectronic Semiconductor Productsis sufficient to permit the initiation of proceedings under the guidelinesand is reproduced as part of this notice. In remarks reported at 49 Cong. Rec. S12919 (daily ed. October 3, 1984)and 49 Cong. Rec. E4434 (daily ed. October 10, 1984), both Senator Mathiasand Representative Kastenmeier suggest that [i]n making determinationsof good faith efforts and progress * * *, the Secretary should take intoaccount the attitudes and efforts of the foreign nation's private sector,as well as its Government. If the private sector encourages and supportsaction toward chip protection, that progress is much more likely to continue* * *. With respect to the participation of foreign nationals and thosecontrolled by them in chip piracy, the Secretary should consider whetherany chip designs, not simply those provided full protection under the Act,are subjected to misappropriation. The degree to which a foreign concernthat distributes products containing misappropriated chips knows or shouldhave known that it is selling infringing chips is a relevant factor inmaking a finding under section 914(a)(2). Finally, under section 914(a)(3),the Secretary should bear in mind the role that issuance of the order itselfmay have in promoting the purposes of this chapter and international comity.The Commissioner is considering issuing an interim order extending theprotection of chapter 9 of title 17 of the United States Code to the nationals,domiciliaries, and sovereign authorities of Austria. Written comment onthe request of the petitioners and requests to testify must be receivedin the Office of the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks on or before5:00 p.m., April 25, 1989. A public hearing is scheduled for May 4, 1989,at 1:00 p.m. to receive further public comment on this petition.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donald J.

The Englishtranslation of the text which was furnished in cooperation between WIPOand the Austrian Patent Office, is published in the January review of WIPO``Industrial Property''. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Law gives, upon request, an exclusive right to the creator ofa topography defined as a three-dimensional structure of micro-electronicsemiconductor products. It provides for a sui generis form of protectionmodelled along the lines of patent protection, and accords protection onthe basis of originality resulting from an intellectual effort on the partof the creator who produced a topography which was not commonplace. Compulsorylicenses are not provided for. The effect of the protection shall not extendto acts of reverse engineering (Section 6(2)). The innocent infringer isprotected (Section 6 (7)). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Law provides for a registration system, without examination asto substance. Protection under the Law will be accorded for a maximum periodof ten years after the commencement of protection. Among the other provisionsare provisions relating to the establishment of a register in the PatentOffice, cancellation proceedings to be conducted in the Patent Office,and both civil and criminal court proceedings for infringement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Protection under the Law is available to both nationals of and residentsin Austria and, on a reciprocal basis, to nationsls of, and residents in,States party to an intergovernmental agreement to which Austria is alsoparty, or of States identified in ordinances of the Federal Minister forEconomic Affairs (Section 5 (1) and (2)). The Austrian Law does not providefor the possibility of interim extended protection. After the reciprocityhas been established the same protection will be granted to foreignersas to Austrian nationals and domicilaries. Such an extension would be permanent.In this connection the Austrian Government will declare its intention toextend the protection to US mask works by an ordinance of the Federal Ministerfor Economic Affairs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We therefore are of the opinion that the statutory criteria for eligibilityunder section 902(a)(2) SCPA would be met insofar as the protection affordedunder the Austrian Law is substantially the same as that provided for underthe SCPA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Austria is not only one of the first European Countries having enacteda law taking into account the international standards in this field butit also took an active part on the preparatory work in respect to the DiplomaticConference in Washington in May 1989, and will be represented in this conferencein order to cooperate in finding solutions for all acceptable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Having demonstrated this situation in view to make evidence that Austriahas been making good faith efforts and reasonable progress as requiredin Section 914 we would ask you to find the initiation of an evaluationfor the issuance of a Section 902 proclamation in favor of owners of maskworks who are Austrian nationals, domicilaries or sovereign authoritiesappropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Encl.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Yours sincerely, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Dr. Josef Fichte, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">President of the Austrian Patent Office.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">AUSTRIA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Federal Law of June 23, 1988, on the Protection of the Topographiesof Microelectronic Semiconductor Products</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">(Semiconductor Protection Law) \1\</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp8,p8,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,9</C><T3>Table of Contents \1\</T3><H1> </H1><H1/><T3>Section</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">Subject of Protection<D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Originality<D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Right to Protection<D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lapse of Right<D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Assertion of Right<D>5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Effect of Protection<D>6 and 7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Commencement and Duration of Protection<D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Application Requirements<D>9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Semiconductor Register<D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Publication<D>11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transfer; Licenses<D>12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Declaration of Nullity<D>13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Declaration of Lack of Title<D>14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Requests for Declaration<D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Competence<D>16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Procedure<D>17</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Inspection of Files<D>18</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Representation<D>19</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Obligation to Furnish Information<D>20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Infringement of Semiconductor Rights<D>21 and 22</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Competence<D>23</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Preliminary Questions<D>24</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Relationship to the Copyright Law<D>25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Citations<D>26</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Entry into Force<D>27</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Implementation<D>28</D><F>\1\ Added by WIPO.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Subject of Protection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1._(1)<NOTE/> Protection under this Federal Law may be obtained, upon request,for three-dimensional structures of microelectronic semiconductor products(topographies) if and insofar as they are original (Section 2).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>German title:</T3> Bundesgsetz vom 23.
