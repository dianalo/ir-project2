Large bone defects in sheep were healed using thesubstance, known as BMP-2. The bone defects were so largethey wouldn't otherwise have healed, Genetics Institute said.</LP><TEXT>   Genetics Institute, based in Cambridge, Mass., reportedcloning the gene for the protein in December 1988 and isevaluating it for treatment of bone fractures and some bonedisorders. &quot;The ability to induce the formation of bone thatis identical to normal human bone opens the door to reducingthe need for bone grafts and may revolutionize the field oforthopedic surgery,&quot; said the Harvard researcher, TobinGerhart.</TEXT></DOC>
