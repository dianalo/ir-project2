Jerry Brown, a free-trade advocate whenGovernor of the nation-sized state that faces the PacificRim, traded growth for votes in Michigan without blinking.That got him 26% of the vote.   Governor Clinton thus emerges from the domestic-contentstate with his free-trade credentials essentially intact. Sofar, Bill Clinton has mostly run up the score in theDemocratic primaries by bellowing class resentments at the&quot;Roseanne&quot; crowd. But it's intriguing and encouraging thateven in Michigan he left the protectionist card to Mr. Brown.A lot of different subjects and rhetoric are going to flowover the falls between now and November, but when it's over,trade is a crucial issue that the next President has to getright. The consequences of getting it wrong, at thisimportant turning point in history, are enormous.</LP><TEXT>   Should Mr. Clinton secure the Democratic nomination, we'dpresumably have two candidates running for the presidency whohave stated commitments to the principle of an open worldeconomy. That's fine, but in America's recent politicalhistory, the siren song of protectionism always seems to belurking around the next corner. We guess this means that thepoliticians are invariably going to be several steps behindthe American voter.   The political names that come to mind in surveying theadvocates of protectionism are Gephardt, Dole, Dukakis,Wofford, Harkin, Kerrey, Buchanan and Brown. ExceptingWofford, who beat a Bush stand-in who loyally stood for nextto nothing, all came up losers when playing the trade card.   Meanwhile, President Bush, who reached a free-tradeagreement with Canada and is pushing one with Mexico, iswinning. Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, counts as one of his closeadvisers Robert Reich of Harvard, who understands quite wellthe international side of the new global economy. Mr. Reichis indeed right that what we need are not American-basedfirms but high-skill jobs for more Americans.   Yet somehow even candidates with these principles feel aneed to bow to their losing protectionist opponents.President Bush waffled some on trade this past week, forinstance, by running campaign commercials publicizing PatBuchanan's ownership of a Mercedes. No doubt the Bushcampaign staff found irresistible the chance to take a hardshot at someone who'd called them virtually a subsidiary ofJapan Inc. But the ad implicitly put the Bush campaign in theBuyAmerican camp, creating potential for future confusionsover the President's stance.   Mr. Clinton, for his part, has on occasion had praise forthe trade law's draconian Section 301 provision, whichtriggers retaliation against foreigners for alleged unfairtrade practices, which some of his supporters find puzzling.   A political argument can be made for both Messrs. Clintonand Bush getting unambiguously behind free trade.   In Mr. Clinton's case, it would simply look incongruousfor an obviously intelligent and well-educated 46-year-old tocome on like some Buchananized mossback. The members of Billand Hillary Clinton's generation know there is a world ofrapidly developing and integrating economies out there --Korea, Mexico, Turkey, Hungary, Taiwan and inevitably Russiaand China. The national electorate is probably moreinterested in voting for a President with a modern world viewthan another insular Southern populist. We suspect GovernorClinton can make the adjustment.   Unless President Bush captures the free-trade issue first.They say Mr. Bush doesn't believe in anything much. But atruly liberal trading system is an exception. He believes init deeply, and that undoubtedly would come through if hemoved the issue to the center of his campaign rhetoric, aswell as his administration's interpretations of the Canadianagreement and the antitrust implications of Japanesekeiretsu.   Ultimately, a candidate's stand on trade reflects morethan politics. There is the matter of leadership, of havingthe skills to see with one's own eyes what is going on in theworld and recognizing America's role in that world. PatBuchanan and Jerry Brown are losers because they are rantingabout foreign threats at the very time when Japan's economyis stumbling badly and when Germany is struggling withintegrating the formerly communist east. If those two worldeconomic locomotives slow, the U.S. President better befocused on something larger and more important than the&quot;domestic content&quot; of Hondas.</TEXT></DOC>
