Data for survivaltime and number of tumors induced suggests that in addition to the length/widthfactors, an additional property plays a role in fiber potency. Analysisof the available data from the literature, where populations were knownto have been exposed to pure mineral fibers, indicates that ranking forhuman mesothelioma incidence appears congruent with the rat intrapleuraldata.</TEXT></DOC>
