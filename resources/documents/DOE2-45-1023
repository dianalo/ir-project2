An alkylationprocess for producing alkylate gasoline with much higher RON(approx.96) than those of conventional hydrocracked an isomerized gasolines andwith higher MON (approx. 94) than those of FCC and reformed gasolineshas been recently spotlighted as a technology for manufacturing a highquality automotive gasoline base. Viewing the technology from the standpointof effective utilization of semi-finished petroleum products, it is basedon the good use of C{sub 4}-fractions which have been used as the petroleumfeed stock so far. In this process, Alkylate is produced by a catalyticreaction of C{sub 4}-Olefins, by-products in the FCC plant, with iso-butane,a by-product in the reformer plant. The sulfuric acid process of ER andE is outlined. (2 figs, 3 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
