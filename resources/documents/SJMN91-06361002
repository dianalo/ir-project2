I don't wantit to die during winter. How do I care for it, and when and how do I pruneit?;   -- S.D., Santa Clara  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PRUNE FUCHSIAS NOW, THEN PINCH IN SPRING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Mailbag  </MEMO><TEXT>     A Hanging basket fuchsias (trailing fuchsias) are probably the easiest toprune. Prune in January, even if the plant is still blooming.;   Start bycutting all the branches back to the rim of the pot or basket. Then remove anybranches growing upward. Leave a 1/4-inch stub for a 1/4-inch branch, 1/2-inchstub for a 1/2-inch branch and so on. Now looking down at the plant from thetop try to shape the plant so that it resembles the spokes of a wheel,removing crowded branches, leaving stubs as stated above.;   To protect from apossible freeze bring the plant indoors or place it in a covered patio whenforecasters warn about freezing temperatures. Some fuchsia growers place athick layer of mulch around the base of the plant after pruning to give theplant extra protection.;   Keep the soil moist but not soggy in the winter.When the plant is older you may want to transplant to a new, larger pot. Tipthe plant out of the old pot, work half the soil away from the rootball andcut off the coarse roots. Leave the fine roots. Replant, using a purchased,prepared soil mix. Place a shard of broken pottery over the hole prior tobackfilling and planting.;   For many flowers, it is necessary to tip prune --an ongoing process in the spring. Pinch back new shoots on the growing tips toforce branching and give more flowers. Do this through May or June or untilthe plant is as big as you want. Blooming will start about six weeks later.;  Fertilize during the growth period every other week with a complete liquidfertilizer, following directions on the label. It is almost impossible towater a fuchsia too much.;   Q Can I use leaves from fig trees in a compostpile or work them into my garden soil? I question it because of the milky sapof the fruit and leaves when cut.;   -- A.M., Union City;   A Leaves from figtrees make excellent compost. The milky sap the trees exude does not affectthe decomposition of the leaves by the micro-organisms that turn leaves, twigsand clippings into compost. It is best to compost leaves and other organicmatter before working them into the soil. Briefly, the act of decomposingorganic matter robs the soil of nutrients needed for plant growth. Puttingleaves into the soil without first composting them can literally starve anyplants you want to grow until the leaves have been completely broken down.;  This can take a few weeks or months to accomplish depending on the moistureand warmth of the soil.;   Q Is there any place in the San Jose area where Ican get tree roses for around $5 to $10? What is the lowest price and whereare they sold?;   -- J.S., San Jose;   A It takes more years to train and growa rose to a &quot;tree&quot; form than what it takes to grow a bush rose. Time is money.The grower and retailer has to make a profit to stay in business, hence thehigher cost for the tree roses. Some roses are patented varieties commanding ahigher price. After the patent expires the price may drop. Growers andretailers are beginning to advertise this year's prices as this is the timetree roses are sold as bare-root stock. Check the advertisements in the GardenSection for the best buys.;   Q I've seen a real nice magazine called NationalGardening, and wonder how I can subscribe to it?;   -- F. O., San Jose; ANational Gardening is one of my favorite magazines, too. It is publishedbi-monthly with an annual subscription rate of $18. Write to NationalGardening Association, P.O.
