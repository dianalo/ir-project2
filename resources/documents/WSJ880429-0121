Polls show huge public support for mandatory notification of plant closings -- the provision of the trade bill prompting a Reagan veto. Democrats say the issue underscores GOP vulnerability on trade woes. They will hit it hard in the November elections. &quot;This is not only something good to saddle Bush with, but it allows Dukakis to talk about his own experience,&quot; says Chris Edley, a Dukakis adviser.    Republicans counter that a plant-closings law in Massachusetts is voluntary, an approach they support. But GOP lawmakers warn Reagan not just to emphasize plant closings with his veto: That creates the &quot;perception&quot; that Republicans are against &quot;the poor working men and women who only get four days' notice,&quot; Senate GOP Leader Dole worries.    Dukakis plans at least one plant-closings event a week through the primaries to highlight the issue.    GROWING UNREST in Eastern Europe produces openings and risks for the U.S.    New strikes in Poland are part of the turmoil in the region. Church and state are sparring in East Germany, and Romania's dictatorship is driving the nation to economic ruin. Factional struggles shake Hungary. &quot;Eastern Europe appears ready to explode somewhere,&quot; says Ronald Asmus, a Rand Corp. analyst.    U.S. officials hope to use the unrest to weaken the Kremlin's hold. Led by Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead, they are slowly increasing ties with Soviet-bloc nations. What they fear is a social explosion that would prompt the Soviets to crack down. &quot;East Europeans,&quot; a U.S. official says, &quot;are certain to test the limits of Gorbachev's tolerance.&quot;    PRESSURES MOUNT more on Gorbachev than on Reagan for the summit.    The Soviet leader faces a crucial post-summit Communist Party meeting in June, where his power will be tested again. A feud with Kremlin rival Ligachev makes Gorbachev even more eager to show he is producing results. Neither side expects a strategic-arms agreement at the May summit, but U.S. officials say the Soviets seem intent on signing something, if only a cultural-exchange accord.    U.S. strategists have concerns, too. They complain that Congress's foot-dragging on the intermediate-missile treaty may rob Reagan of a prize he could have when he goes to Moscow; the gripes may be a ploy to get action. The president also wants to stress touchy human-rights issues at the meeting.    White House aides quietly seek a pre-summit Reagan appearance on Soviet TV, like Gorbachev's NBC interview before the Washington summit.    SLEAZE SWITCH: At a time when Democrats are attacking Republicans on the sleaze issue and Bush sidesteps questions on Meese, GOP strategists discuss making Democratic ethics an issue in House campaigns. They consider TV ads attacking Speaker Wright's personal finances.    OFF THE HOOK: The resignation of Justice Department criminal-division chief Weld erases Rhode Island Rep. St Germain's risk of indictment for taking meals from lobbyists. Agency lawyers who ran a grand-jury investigation urged no action, citing House rules allowing nearly unlimited entertainment. Weld was reluctant to drop the case.    DOLE'S OUTBURST against press coverage of his presidential campaign has political analysts, who think he was treated well, shaking their heads. But his attack doesn't surprise many of his closest advisers, who saw his temper and anger firsthand. Sighs one: &quot;Dole is a constant in a sea of change.&quot;    AWKWARD EXIT: Treasury chief Baker's anticipated departure come summer to head the Bush campaign may be complicated by difficulties in finding a successor. Officials fear that moving up Deputy Secretary McPherson wouldn't reassure the jittery financial markets. Deputy Secretary of State Whitehead wants the job, but his support is uncertain.    ROSY SCENARIO LIVES: A strong economy puts deficit goals within reach.    First-quarter numbers support the White House projection of 2.4% growth this year; private forecasts are being ratcheted up. Commerce Undersecretary Ortner now says the administration's estimate may even be &quot;a little too low.&quot; This fiscal year's deficit may dip below last year's $150 billion, as the administration had predicted amid much skepticism.    The budget picture could be brightened, too, by better-than-expected tax receipts, Treasury officials say. Last year's stock-market crash spurred investors to sell shares purchased early in the bull market; that apparently created large, taxable capital gains. But rising interest rates could change the rosy outlook.    A one-percentage-point rise in interest rates adds about $5 billion to the deficit.    MINOR MEMOS: A sign seen at the Scranton-Wilkes Barre airport reads: &quot;Get off your tush and vote for Bush.&quot; . . . Playing hardball: Dukakis snipes that Bush is the only candidate to have a league named after him. . . . Illinois Rep. Hyde warns colleagues that special-interest groups will &quot;go through the roof and climb down your throat -- which, when you stop and think about it, is no small trick.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
