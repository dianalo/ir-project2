For much of his adult life, Mr. Navarro, as one of theleaders of the M-19 guerrilla group, ran for cover fromColombia's authorities. Now, the 42-year-old Mr. Navarro isrunning for president.</LP><TEXT>   M-19's decision earlier this year to lay down its arms andfight with ballots rather than bullets is seen by many hereas a sign that peace can be achieved in violence-tornColombia. Never Colombia's most radical guerrilla group, M-19is now seeking a place for itself in the country's politicallandscape as a non-Communist left-wing player and hopes toconvince other guerrilla groups to follow its example.   But sitting in his Bogota campaign headquarters, clad in abullet-proof vest and surrounded by machine gun-totingsecurity guards, Mr. Navarro says it was a lot easier being aguerrilla than a candidate.   &quot;More candidates have been killed in the past few monthsthan guerrilla chiefs,&quot; he says. So what prompted M-19 toswitch from fighting Colombia's institutions to trying to runthem? &quot;It's crazy,&quot; he acknowledges. &quot;But we Colombians arecrazy people.&quot;   Mr. Navarro's presence in the elections next Sunday speaksvolumes about Colombia's craziness. He was only picked asM-19's candidate after the guerrilla group's charismaticleader, Carlos Pizarro, was gunned down by an assassin on acommercial flight while en route to a campaign appearance --the third Colombian presidential candidate to be killed innine months.   Mr. Navarro is no stranger to violence either. He lost hisleft leg when a grenade was thrown at him in 1985 at a timewhen he was seeking to negotiate a truce between M-19 and thegovernment. The grenade attack occured as Mr. Navarro wasresting after being mysteriously kidnapped and just asmysteriously freed by a still-unidentified group. Afternearly dying, Mr. Navarro underwent long months of therapy inCuba and Mexico, where he remained in exile until last year.   Attacks and kidnapping were M-19's stock in trade too --though it mixed these with attention-getting stunts such asthe 1974 robbery of the sword and spurs of freedom fighterSimon Bolivar or Robin Hood-style raids on supermarkets todistribute food to the poor.   The group is best known for its 1985 assault on Bogota'sPalace of Justice that ended in tragedy when at least 95people, including the country's chief justice, died duringthe 26-hour battle. M-19 also stormed the Dominican RepublicEmbassy in 1980 and held 14 foreign ambassadors hostage fortwo months until huge ransoms were paid. And in 1987, M-19kidnapped conservative politician Alvaro Gomez, who today isrunning for president against his former captors.   To M-19 officials and sympathizers, this symbolizes thenew spirit of democracy and dialogue, rather than violence,that is in the air. &quot;If we only had successes, we'd be inpower,&quot; Mr. Navarro acknowledges.   &quot;There are no perspectives for bearded people descendingfrom the mountains and occupying Bolivar Square,&quot; the name ofthe main square in most Colombian cities, he adds. &quot;We haveto recognize that today that's not possible. We have torepresent the broadest interest of society. Today, whatsociety wants is peace.&quot;   For M-19, the end of 16 years of guerrilla warfare came atan emotional ceremony in March in the mountain rebel campsiteof Santo Domingo, 200 miles southwest of Bogota. &quot;ForColombia and for peace, lay down your arms,&quot; an M-19 officerordered, and one by one, the guerrillas placed their weapons,draped in red, yellow and blue M-19 flags on a table, inreturn for amnesty. The next day, more than 400 guerrillasburned their camouflage uniforms, changed into civilianclothes and rode down the mountains in buses.   Today, M-19 is urging other guerrilla groups to followtheir example and offering to act as an intermediary innegotiations. Three guerrilla and peasant self-defense groupshave indicated willingness to join the peace process, butseveral other Marxist guerrilla groups are still fighting anddisrupting the electoral process. That includes the4,000-strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and theradical 1,500-strong National Liberation Army, which claimsresponsibility for a recent wave of assassinations andkidnappings.   So strongly in favor of peace is M-19 that it even urgesthe government to give up its 10-month old war on drugs andmake a deal with the drug lords, who initiated another waveof deadly bombings after the government turned down theiroffers to get out of the business in return for thegovernment rescinding an extradition treaty with the U.S.   The way Mr. Navarro sees it, Colombia is being asked tomake all the efforts in the war on drugs and pay the violentprice of the extradition treaty while drug-consumingcountries do little to curb the problem. &quot;The war is here,people are dying, while Americans are happily consumingcocaine,&quot; says Mr. Navarro. &quot;We can't keep doing what theState Department wants.&quot;   Many Colombians, including conservatives, subscribe toM-19's view, arguing that the cocaine cartels' bombs are justas criminal as M-19's violence and kidnappings, for which thegroup was pardoned. But government officials retort thatpolitical crimes are different under Colombian law from thecommon criminal actions of narcotic traffickers.   Although M-19's position on drugs differs radically fromthe government's, officials say the fact it is voicing it isa victory for Colombian democracy and the peace process.&quot;M-19 gave up its violent ways, but its politics are the sameas before,&quot; says Rafel Pardo, who negotiated the peace accordwith M-19. &quot;That's what the peace process is all about. We'renot asking them to give up their ideas.&quot;   Mr. Navarro and many independent analysts see a strongpossibility for M-19 filling a political void on the leftthat could break the traditional bipartisan nature ofColombian politics, in which the Liberal and Conservativeparties take the lion's share of the vote. But so far, Mr.Navarro, who looks uncomfortable in a suit and tie andbullet-proof vest, hasn't been able to take much advantage ofdemocracy. With three candidates already killed, the campaignhas been largely limited to television addresses and smallmeetings with selected individuals under heavy security.   &quot;We were in clandestinity for 16 years, and now we'releading a clandestine campaign,&quot; jokes Rosenberg Pabon,M-19's campaign manager. Adds Mr. Navarro, pointing to hisretinue of security guards, &quot;I'm a prisoner candidate. Theonly difference with the past is that before they hunted meand now they protect me.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
