Out of 47,960 A-bomb survivorsexamined during seven years from 1979 through 1986, 58 were found tohave lung cancer. The prevalence of lung cancer was 120.9/100,000, whichwas extremely higher than previously reported. A-bomb survivors, as wellas persons exposed to environmental pollution and occupational hazards,are considered to belong to the high risk group for lung cancer. Asymptomaticlung cancer was of earlier stage than symptomatic lung cancer. It wasalso associated with higher surgical rate and faborable prognosis. Primaryscreening failed to detect lung cancer in 20 %, requiring double checkingby pulmonary disease specialists. The role of health care workers isstressed in view of the necessity of detailed examination and surgeryfor lung cancer. (Namekawa, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
