Wu'er Kaixi, who with Wang was among the best-known leaders ofthe democracy movement suppressed last month, told a news conferencehe had received confirmation of his colleague's arrest earlier inthe day.   ``Wang Dan is one of the greatest fighters for freedom in Chinatoday,'' Wang told a news conference, his voice cracking withemotion.   ``Recently the authorities have tried to dirty Wang Dan's imageby calling him a traitor. The contribution of Wang Dan, this20-year-old student, will live on in the history of China.''   In Beijing today, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua refusedto comment on persistent reports there that Wang is under arrest.   Wu'er and four other Chinese dissidents issued an appeal togovernments, the United Nations, human rights groups and individualsaround the world to pressure the Chinese government ``to put an endto secret arrests, to torture, to secret executions.''   The five also proposed that a representative assembly be calledto create a Chinese Democratic Front to unite Chinese ``withoutdistinction of parties, tendencies, groups, beliefs, professions orregions to unite under the banner of liberty, democracy, legalismand human rights.''   Wu'ur was joined by businessman Wan Runnan, political scientistYan Jiaqi, journalist Liu Binyan and economist Su Shaozhi, theformer director of the Institute for Marxist-Leninist studies inBeijing.   Liu said he does not believe the current government in China canlast more than two years.   ``I'm not saying that what will follow Li Peng will be ademocratic government, but it will be replaced by a more moderatefaction,'' he said. ``We cannot predict when a Gorbachev mightemerge in China, but it's a possibility,'' he said, referring toSoviet President Mikhai S. Gorbachev.   Wu'er said there was no organization in place to help wantedleaders get out of China.   ``Before June 4, we never would have imagined that the governmentwould be so cruel and barbarous, so we never had such anorganization,'' he said.   He said he and others who escaped ``have the responsibility tocontinue the work of all those who have been arrested and executedand lost their lives.''   Since the June 3-4 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, atleast 12 people who participated in the protests have been executed.   China's official Xinhua news agency has said nearly 100 soldiersand police died and that thousands were injured, while about 100civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured in the crackdown.Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the deathtoll may have been as high as 3,000.</TEXT></DOC>
