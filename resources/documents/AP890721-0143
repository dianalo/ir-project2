Agricultural groups and farm-state lawmakers opposed thedepartment's original 1987 proposal to change the regulatoryclassification of anhydrous ammonia, saying it would drive upprices of the nitrogen fertilizer for farmers by increasingshipping and insurance costs.   In the face of those objections, the department unveiled a newproposal that would continue to classify anhydrous ammonia as a``nonflammable gas'' but require tanks and other containers tocarry an ``Inhalation Hazard'' label. The new marking would be inaddition to the ``nonflammable gas'' label currently required.   The original proposal would have required anhydrous ammonia tocarry a warning placard of ``Inhalation Hazard'' and a whitediamond sign with a skull and crossbones.   The agency will publish its latest proposal in the FederalRegister next week and will open a 90-day period for comment. Afinal decision on the regulatory rulemaking would be made lateralthough there is no deadline, according to a department spokesman.   On Capitol Hill, farm-state lawmakers applauded the department'scompromise.   ``We'll live with this,'' said Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., whohelped lead congressional opposition to the poisonous gasclassification. ``We finally got the message through and won alittle victory.''   Farmers apply anhydrous ammonia directly to the soil, with cornand wheat producers among the main farm users.   Although there is no dispute that anhydrous ammonia can causeinjury or even death if it is inhaled at high concentrations,opponents of the regulatory change argued that the pronounced odorof the gas acts as a warning even at low concentrations and helpsprevent undue exposure in the event of a leak or accident.</TEXT></DOC>
