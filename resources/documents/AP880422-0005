NATO long has complained that Denmark does not pull its weightin the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Its annual defensespending _ 2.2 percent of its gross national product in 1987 _ isthe lowest of NATO's European members except for Greece and Italy.   For 31 years, Denmark has had a general policy banning nucleararms from its soil in peacetime. Until now, Danish officials tookthe position of assuming that visiting warships would obey.   Last week, Parliament voted to demand that warships be told theycannot carry nuclear arms into Danish ports.   At NATO headquarters here, officials say the measure, ifimplemented, would render NATO's reinforcement strategy for Denmarkuseless.   The measure led Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's minoritygovernment to call for early elections May 10.   The center-right government opposes the nuclear-armed warshipmeasure and maintains Danes remain loyal to NATO.   One Danish NATO official said that in a marriage, ``it behooveseither partner not to be confrontational.''   ``We should not exaggerate the situation but accept there aredifferences of opinion within NATO,'' said the official, who spokeon condition of anonymity.   Such comments do little to calm the nerves of NATO officialswhose primary concern is to maintain an iron-clad consensus aboutdefense, notably nuclear arms.   NATO members Norway and Spain both prohibit the stationing ofnuclear arms on their soil during peacetime. But neither requiresvisiting NATO warships to declare whether they are carrying sucharms.   In 1984, the United States and Britain broke off militarycooperation with New Zealand after that country began insistingthat warships say whether or not they carry nuclear weapons.   ``We know that in some cases allied warships carried nucleararms into our ports,'' said the Danish official. ``This, of course,was not allowed but we closed one eye,'' said the Danish official.   To tell visiting warships they cannot carry nuclear arms intoDanish ports would, said NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington,``run counter to the basis of NATO strategy and the principles ofshared burdens and benefits'' of alliance membership.   The United States and Britain, which would rush to Denmark's aidin times of crisis with troops and materiel, have a policy of neversaying whether their warships have nuclear arms.   A U.S. NATO official said this week that the stricteranti-nuclear stand, if taken to its logical conclusion, would meanNATO allies cannot reinforce Denmark during a crisis before theoutbreak of war.   Failure to reinforce NATO's choke-point on the Soviet Union'sBaltic fleet would affect not just Denmark but also neighboringWest Germany.   ``It's clear this is not a Danish-American or Danish-Britishproblem, but a matter for all of the alliance,'' said a senior WestGerman NATO source, also speaking privately.   The controversy led NATO to move next week's NATO defenseministers meeting from Denmark to Brussels. The meeting will focuson nuclear defense issues.   In 1985, Mchael Hesseltine, then British defense secretary,warned Danes not to expect British soldiers to come to their aid ifthey don't do more for their own defense.   Last March, Danish Lt. Gen. Poul Thorsen, NATO's top commanderfor the Baltic Approaches, resigned and said he could no longer``represent Denmark in a reasonable manner.'' He said Danishdefense was being ``maltreated'' through gross underfinancing.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Robert J.
