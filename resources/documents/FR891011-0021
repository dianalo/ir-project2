A numberof state and Federal agencies investigated the causes and effects of thismass mortality event (die-off). The following report on the cause of thedie-off is available by writing to the <T2>Address </T2>listed above.<ITAG tagnum="21">Geraci, J.R. 1989.

The dolphins were apparently poisonedby brevetoxin, a neurotoxin produced by the dinoflagellate <T3>Ptychodiscus brevis,</T3> Florida's red tide organism. Contributingto the ultimate demise of the animals was a host of microbial and environmentalfactors. Dr. Geraci also noted the possibility that high contaminant levelsfound in the dolphins' tissues (e.g., organochlorines) may have affectedtheir resilience and rendered them more susceptible either to the toxinor to the microorganisms that eventually killed them.NOAA's Southeast Fisheries Center reports on stock structure and abundanceof the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin and has assessed the impact of the dolphindie-off.

On December 10, the CMC amended itspetition with additional information and concerns regarding stock differentiation.CMC noted the scientific debate on the geographic ``distinctness'' of thecoastal population and stated that all dead animals cannot with certaintybe assigned to a coastal stock. In re-stating its position, the CMC recommendedthat NOAA Fisheries proceed with a depletion designation until such timeas the question of stock differentiation is resolved. As discussed below,NOAA Fisheries believes that the stranded animals were primarily from aseparate, coastal stock that migrates between Florida and New Jersey. Copiesof the CMC's rulemaking petitions are available from the Information Contactlisted above.The MMPA Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100-71) added a new section 115to provide specific timetables and procedures for conducting status reviews,for rulemaking on depletion, and for preparing conservation plans for marinemammals. In this instance, no petition for a status report was receivedsince the report was already completed and available in June, 1988 (Scottet al. 1988b). Based on information provided in the status report, CMCpetitioned NOAA Fisheries to begin rulemaking procedures necessary to designatethis stock as depleted under the MMPA. Before rulemaking can begin, however,new subsection 115(a)(2) requires publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of a call to assist the Secretary [of Commerce]in obtaining scientific information from individuals and organizationsconcerned with the conservation of marine mammals, from persons in anyindustry which might be affected by the determination, and from academicinstitutions. In addition, the Secretary shall utilize, to the extent feasible,informal working groups of interested parties and other methods to gatherthe necessary information. NOAA Fisheries finds that CMC's petition has substantial merit and is givingserious consideration to proposing this stock for depleted status. Thisadvance notice of proposed rulemaking incorporates the ``call for assistance''required by section 115(a)(2) and a summary review of the 1988 status report.Based on a review of any scientific submissions received as a result ofthis notice, and all comments received on our proposal, NOAA Fisherieswill determine, prior to publication of any proposed rule, whether thereis a need for informal working groups to gather additional information.<ITAG tagnum="84">Status Report Summary</ITAG>1. Stock StructureBottlenose dolphins are found in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in U.S. Atlanticwaters. In the U.S. Atlantic, this species is found from Long Island, NYto the Florida Keys. North of Cape Hatteras, NC, bottlenose dolphins havea disjunct distribution with concentrations along the coast (in embaymentsand within several kilometers of the coast) and offshore near the continentalshelf margin (from 60 to 200 kilometers from the coast). South of CapeHatteras, the coastal/offshore distribution is less distinct. During summer in the U.S. Atlantic, bottlenose dolphins are distributedalong the coast as far north as Long Island, NY and offshore as far northas Nova Scotia,   Canada. The main summertime, coastal bottlenose dolphinconcentration is from North Carolina to New Jersey. During autumn, densitydistribution patterns observed from population surveys suggest that coastalanimals migrate south to Florida. During winter, bottlenose dolphins incoastal U.S. Atlantic waters are distributed from south of Cape Hatterasto the northern and central Florida coast, but concentrate at the southernend of this range. During spring, concentrations shift northward alongthe coast to complete a hypothesized migratory cycle. It is not clear whetherthe offshore population follows a similar north-south pattern.There appear to be both near-shore (coastal) and offshore stocks of bottlenosedolphins along the U.S. Atlantic coast and in other ocean areas. Thereare apparent morphological and biochemical differences between the coastaland offshore stocks found in South Africa, the eastern North Pacific andin the southeastern United States. For example, offshore animals are generallylarger and have higher concentrations of hemoglobin than coastal or warmer-waterstocks. Some animals with intermediate blood characteristics have beenfound in the wild, suggesting some, probably low, frequency of geneticexchange between stocks. Within the coastal population there are probablylocal, resident stocks in certain embayments (e.g., near Savannah, GA)and a stock that migrates into and out of these embayments on a seasonalbasis (coastal-migratory stock). The stranding data collected during 1987and 1988, and the observed density distribution patterns along the U.S.Atlantic coast, support the hypothesis of a single coastal-migratory stockof bottlenose dolphins that ranges seasonally as far north as Long Island,NY and as far south as central Florida. Both coastal-migratory and offshore stocks may have been affected by thedie-off. The likelihood of an animal dying offshore, however, and thenbeing stranded onshore is expected to be considerably less than for ananimal dying near the coast. Thus, reported strandings may not includeoffshore animals that did not come ashore. Of 36 blood samples taken fromaffected animals, 35 exhibited coastal hemoglobin characteristics. Onesample showed hybrid coastal/offshore characteristics. Resident, localstocks were apparently unaffected by the die-off. Best available informationsuggests that the observed mortality may have primarily affected the coastal-migratorystock of dolphins that ranges between Florida and New Jersey.2. Population AbundanceHistorically, about 15,000 bottlenose dolphins are thought to have livedin mid-Atlantic coastal waters (including coastal-migratory and residentstocks) based on records from the turn of the century. In 1979-81, theestimated average mid-Atlantic summer abundance of bottlenose dolphinsis believed to have ranged from 4,300 to 12,900 animals (95% confidencelevel) including both coastal and offshore stocks, i.e., the total U.S.mid-Atlantic population. The best available information suggests that,in recent times, coastal North Carolina and Virginia supported 1,200 ormore dolphins during part of the spring and summer. This number may haverepresented a substantial portion of the mid-Atlantic, coastal-migratorystock prior to the die-off. Population surveys of August, 1987 resultedin estimates of 350 to 1,300 animals in the coastal mid-Atlantic. Recentestimates may be conservative and represent surface abundance only.The most direct way to assess the effect of the 1987-88 die-off on thedolphin population is to compare pre- and post die-off population abundance.In this case, consistent population abundance indices are not yet available;and, additional population survey data collection is needed from the northernand southern range of the stock. Consequently, potential impact of thedie-off was estimated by comparing stranding rates reported during thedie-off period to the prior 3-year average reported stranding rate. Inherentin this method of assessment is the assumption that reported strandingrate is a consistent index of stock mortality rate for the period of analysis.During the 11 month period from June, 1987 through April, 1988, 742 strandedbottlenose dolphins were reported to the Smithsonian Institution's marinemammal stranding events program. This represents 10.11 times the averageannual number of dolphins reported stranded during the previous three years.Assuming that the natural annual mortality rate is 7% (or 6.42% for 11months), based on previously published reports, and assuming further thatthe rate of stranding is proportional to the mortality rate, the totalmortality (m) during the 11 month period of the die-off can be estimatedas 10.11andmultiply;6.42=64.9%. An annual birth rate (b) on the order of11.5% has been estimated based on observations of the percent of calvesin the coastal mid-Atlantic stock of dolphins affected by the die-off.Thus, a potential decline for this stock since early 1987 is estimatedas b-m=^53.4% Higher assumed rates of natural mortality imply larger decreases in stockabundance. A review of the scientific literature suggests that rates of5-10% may reasonably reflect the likely range of natural mortality in captivebottlenose dolphins. The relationship between captive dolphin natural mortalityrates and wild population rates is unknown. Natural mortality rates inwild populations could be higher than in captive dolphins if (1) The risksof death due to natural causes such as disease, predation, and starvationare reduced in the captive environment, or (2) age classes with high ratesof natural mortality in natural populations are under-represented in captivepopulations. There are no available data to test the hypothesis that increased publicawareness increases the probability of detection and reporting of strandedanimals, nor to estimate the possible magnitude of change, especially alongdensely populated coastlines. Increases in this probability of more than4-times over a 5-10% natural mortality range can result in estimates ofpopulation increase due to the die-off. An assumed doubling of the probabilityresults in estimates of decline of 11.7%, 20.9%, and 34.8% for assumedannual natural mortality rates of 5%, 7%, and 10%, respectively. Alternateanalysis of the stranding-rate data, stratifying over portions of the coastmost densely populated, and for which increased public awareness wouldhave the smallest expected impact on the probability of detecting and reportingstrandings, consistently results in estimates of reduction greater than40% over the 5-10% natural mortality rate range. There is a large degree of uncertainty in the estimated magnitude of reductionin the dolphin population due to a lack of data and imprecision in estimatesof natural mortality rates. Further data collection on population abundancelevels and stock discreteness may reduce these uncertainties. On the basisof the best available information, however, NOAA Fisheries concludes thatthe coastal-migratory stock of bottlenose dolphins in the mid-Atlanticprobably declined by more than 50% as a result of the 1987-88 die-off.3. Optimum Sustainable Population The MMPA states that marine mammal species and population stocks shouldnot be permitted to diminish below their OSP. NOAA Fisheries has definedOSP, in 50 CFR 216.3, as a range of population levels from the largestsupportable within the ecosystem (carrying capacity) to the populationlevel that results in maximum net productivity (MNP). MNP is the greatestnet annual increment in population numbers resulting from additions tothe population due to reproduction and growth, less losses due to naturalmortality. MNP is often represented as a percentage of carrying capacity.For example, in northern fur seals MNP occurs when the population is atabout 60% of its carrying capacity. In general, populations of large mammalsappear to grow most rapidly when at numbers greater than 50% of carryingcapacity. By analogy with other large mammal populations, the population level expectedto result in MNP for bottlenose dolphins is greater than 50% of carryingcapacity. However, because of uncertainties regarding abundance estimates,carrying capacity has not been estimated for Atlantic or Gulf stocks ofthis species. Although there remain a number of uncertainties, includingtotal mortality during the die-off, available information for the mid-Atlanticcoastal-migratory stock suggests that this stock may have been reducedby more than 50% due to the die-off. Assuming this level of stock reductionand a stable but unknown carrying capacity, NOAA Fisheries believes thatthis stock is likely to be below OSP and, thus, depleted under the MMPA.A significant reduction in food availability or major changes in physicalenvironmental factors, i.e., atmospheric or oceanographic conditions, ifdemonstrated, could be evidence of a change in carrying capacity for bottlenosedolphins in the coastal mid-Atlantic. But, relatively short-term, naturalor man-induced mortality factors, such as increases in naturally-occurringbiotoxins, would not necessarily be of such a sustained or widespread occurrenceas to constitute a change in the carrying capacity of this environmentfor this species. We have no evidence of significant, permanent changesin this ecosystem that might prevent bottlenose dolphins from eventuallyattaining pre die-off levels.The MMPA defines ``depletion'' to mean, among other things, ``any casein which the Secretary [of Commerce], after consultation with the MarineMammal Commission and the Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammalsestablished under * * * this Act, determines that a species or populationstock is below its [OSP].'' NOAA Fisheries will request consultation andconcurrence by the Marine Mammal Commission before publishing a proposedrule regarding depletion of the coastal-migratory stock of bottlenose dolphinsin the mid-Atlantic.<ITAG tagnum="84">Consequences of a Depletion Designation</ITAG>The MMPA Amendments of 1988 included a new section 114 which replaces mostearlier provisions for granting incidental take authority to commercialfishermen with an interim exemption system valid until October 1, 1993.The purpose of the new system is to provide better information on interactionsbetween commercial fisheries and marine mammals while allowing commercialfishing operations to continue despite NOAA Fisheries' inability to makeOSP determinations for all species affected by the fisheries. The informationcollected in conjunction with the exemption system and information on thesizes and trends of marine mammal populations will be used to develop along-term program to govern the taking of marine mammals associated withcommercial fisheries after October 1, 1993.Depleted stocks may be taken under the interim exemption incidental tocommercial fishing operations; however, no intentional lethal takes ofdepleted stocks or any cetaceans are authorized. Thus, a depletion findingfor the coastal-migratory stock of bottlenose dolphins in the mid-Atlanticwill not necessarily affect commercial fisheries at least until 1993. Ifincidental take in a fishery is found to have a significant impact on amarine mammal population, NOAA Fisheries may issue emergency rules or conditionson exemptions under section 114 to mitigate adverse impacts.Under the MMPA, small incidental takes that have a negligible impact ondepleted stocks may be authorized for certain activities other than commercialfishing; and permits may be issued authorizing taking of depleted speciesfor research purposes. The MMPA requires, however, that, when issuing apermit for research involving lethal taking from a depleted stock, NOAAFisheries first determine that the research will directly benefit the stock,or that the research fulfills a critically important research need.Depleted stocks may not be taken for public display purposes; however,the mid-Atlantic, coastal-migratory stock is not a source of public displayanimals. In recent years, permanent removals form the wild of bottlenosedolphins for public display have been authorized from Gulf of Mexico stocksand from the local population in the Indian-Banana River area on Florida'seast coast. The status of these stocks relative to OSP has not yet beendetermined.If the coastal-migratory stock of bottlenose dolphins in the mid-Atlanticis designated as depleted, NOAA Fisheries will prepare a Conservation Plan,as required by section 115(b) of the MMPA, for the purpose of conservingand restoring the stock to its OSP. In addition to the status of the stockand the cause of its decline, the Plan will include: (a) An assessmentof the existing and possible threats to this population such as pollutionand commercial fishing, (b) a discussion of critical information needssuch as post die-off abundance indices and stock differentiation, (c) adescription of research and management objectives, and (d) a schedule forimplementation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
