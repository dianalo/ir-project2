This amendmentis prompted by reports that operators have experienced duct leak detectionfrom the right pneumatic air duct leak detection system when a significantleak had actually developed in the left pneumatic duct. This condition,if not corrected, could result in the flight crew switching off the inappropriatebleed system, causing loss of all air inflow and airplane depressurization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 7, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The applicable service information may be obtainedfrom Boeing Commercial Airplanes, P.O.

Due consideration has been given to the twocomments received.Both commenters requested that the proposed compliance time of 15 monthsbe extended to 18 months or to 21 months so that the modification couldbe accomplished during various normally scheduled maintanance cycles. TheFAA does not concur. The proposed compliance time was established basedon risk assessment, parts availability, and known maintenance intervals.Neither commenter has provided any new data that would justify a longercompliance time. The FAA has determined that the proposed 15 months isthe maximum allowable timeframe for accomplishing the modification withoutcompromising safety.One commenter also suggested that the compliance time be extended sincethe manufacturer has quoted a 300-day lead time for obtaining the kitsnecessary to accomplish the required modification. The FAA does not concur.The manufacturer has advised FAA that adequate required parts will be availableto affected operators within the proposed compliance time.After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA had determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the rule as proposed.There are approximately 168 Boeing Model 757 series airplanes in the worldwidefleet. It is estimated that 103 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affectedby this AD, that it will take approximately 16 manhours per airplane toaccomplish the required initial inspection and test, and that the avaragelabor cost will be $40 per manhour. Based on these figures, the total costimpact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $88,271.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulationis not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significantlyunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that this rule will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities, becausefew, if any, Model 757 airplanes are operated by small entities. A finalevaluation has been parpared for this regulation and has been placed inthe docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends Section 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:1.
