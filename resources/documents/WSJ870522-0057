Occidental also said the Colombian government recently approved a boost in the field's production to a monthly average of 196,000 barrels of crude oil a day from a previously authorized 170,000 barrels a day. The announcements were made yesterday at the oil, chemical, and agricultural products concern's annual meeting.    Part of the payment apparently will be recognized as profit to Occidental, Eugene Nowak, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said. Mr. Nowak said he didn't know what proportion of the $100 million will show up in second-quarter profit, but said he expected it to be &quot;substantial.&quot; A company spokesman declined to comment. In the 1986 second quarter, Occidental had net of $47.7 million, or 18 cents a share, including a $93 million pre-tax gain from the sale of certain oil and gas properties. Revenue for the quarter was $3.83 billion.    Occidental's sale of half of its holding in the Colombia oil field included an initial payment of $750 million in July 1985, as well as about $85 million to reimburse Occidental for half of its exploration and development costs in the field to that time.    The sale reduced Occidental's holding in the field to 25% from 50%. Shell currently holds a 25% interest in the field, and the remaining 50% is held by Ecopetrol, the Colombian state-owned oil company.    Occidental's pact with Shell provided for $200 million in further payments, contingent on production in the field. The $100 million payment represents half of that contingent amount.    Although Occidental has declined to disclose details of the contingency payments, Mr. Nowak says he believes that the second $100 million payment won't be made for at least several years and is based on production of a substantial portion of the about one billion barrels of reserves estimated for the field.    The Cano Limon field was discovered by Occidental in 1983. Its development, including 500 miles of pipeline, cost about $1.7 billion, shared proportionately among the partners. Production started in December 1985 at 30,000 barrels a day. Output averaged 111,000 barrels a day last year.    The latest approval from Colombia's Ministry of Mines and Energy allows Occidental and its partners to produce as much as 210,000 barrels a day from the Cano Limon field in order to maintain a 196,000 barrel-per-day monthly average.    The Colombian ministry also authorized production from the nearby Redondo field at a rate of 4,000 barrels a day when production at the new field starts next month. The Redondo field is about four miles southwest of Cano Limon.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Occidental's common closed yesterday at $34.375 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
