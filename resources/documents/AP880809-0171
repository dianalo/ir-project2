DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A young Wall Street lawyer at the center of aninsider trading ring known as the ``Yuppie Five'' was sentenced tofour months in prison Tuesday, nearly two years after he admittedhis guilt.   Michael David pleaded guilty in November 1986 to four criminalcounts for his part in an insider trading scheme with three otherWall Street professionals and an investor.   The five, who have all pleaded guilty to various charges, wereall in their 20s at the time of the indictment and were dubbed the``Yuppie Five.'' The case had nothing to do with major insidertrading cases involving Ivan F. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine, saidofficials.   David, 30, of New York City, the last to plead guilty, after hispre-trial motions were denied by U.S. District Judge John Keenan inlate 1986, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, mailfraud and obstruction of a Securities and Exchange Comnmissioninvestigation.   ``You completely disrupt the forces of the free market and helpto create incredible cynicism among the general populace,'' Keenanlectured David.   Defense lawyer Darrell Fennell asked for leniency, noting thatDavid faces disbarment and has been driving a cab to supporthimself.   Visibly irritated, Keenan countered: ``I don't think anyoneshould confuse the practice of law with a right _ it's aprivilege!''   ``I regret my conduct,'' David told Keenan before sentence wasimposed and asked the judge for an opportunity ``to help rebuild mylife as I have tried to do.''   ``If I just say `Go and sin no more,' I'm making a mockery ofthe process,'' said Keenan, slapping his own wrist.   He sentenced David to four months in prison and four yearsprobation. Keenan did not impose a fine but David faces civilpenalties of between $50,000 and $150,000 under a Securities andExchange Commission consent agreement.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Lowenson Jr., noted that Davidhad cooperated extensively with federal investigators for almosttwo years and that if any future trials arise from the probe ``Mr.David would be an important government witness.''</TEXT></DOC>
