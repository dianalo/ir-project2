PAUL, Minn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co. said it anticipates steady growth and improved earnings this year, reflecting solid performance of core businesses and concerted cost-cutting efforts.    Allen F. Jacobson, chairman and chief executive officer of the diversified manufacturer, wouldn't give precise figures, but said he is &quot;not uncomfortable&quot; with analysts' estimates of between $3.90 and $4 in per-share earnings for 1987. Last year, 3M earned $779 million, or $3.40 a share, after a 2-for-1 stock split, on sales of $8.6 billion.    So far this year, unit volume is up about 7% from last year as the company's largest and most profitable business sector, industrial and consumer products, is having &quot;a good year,&quot; he said.    The most troubling of Minnesota Mining's four sectors -- electronic and information technologies -- continues to battle fierce price-cutting of computer floppy disks and videocassettes. Calling it a &quot;down and dirty business,&quot; Mr. Jacobson said that the company nevertheless is in those markets for the long haul and that he is satisfied with cost-reduction efforts. He wouldn't predict when those products would post earnings, but said in an interview that &quot;you might be surprised by the timing of a turnaround.&quot; Some analysts said they don't expect a recovery any time soon.    The company's Life Sciences and Graphic Technologies sectors continue to perform well, Mr. Jacobson said. Life Sciences, which encompasses products for the health-care and safety markets, is maintaining profit margins despite hospital cost-containment restraints, he said.    The company, which is midway through a five-year effort to slash manufacturing costs, is on track with the massive program that calls, for example, for a 35% reduction in a product's manufacturing time, Mr. Jacobson said.    Already the program has freed up sufficient inventory warehousing space that it will be &quot;a long time before we (need to) add a major plant,&quot; he said.    Meanwhile, employment has shrunk to 83,600 from 85,500 a year ago, he added. </TEXT></DOC>
