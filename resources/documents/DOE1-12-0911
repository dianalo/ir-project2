The measurements weremade by means of sensitive Geiger-counters and a gamma-spectrometer placedin cars. The results presented the level of external radiation causedby the cesium fallout on the first of October 1986. In the center ofSouthern Finland there are wide areas with exposure levels exceeding0.04 {mu}Sv h/sup -1/, areas exceeding 0.2 {mu}Sv h/sup -1/ being veryrare. The surface area weighted mean dose rate for the 461 municipalitiesin Finland was 0.037 $mu$Sv h/sup -1/ (range 0-0.23 {mu}Sv h/sup -1/).The corresponding estimated surface activity of /sup 137/Cs was 10.7kBq m/sup -2/. The population weighted mean dose rate was 0.051 {mu}Svh/sup -1/. Results from measurements at eight dose rate monitoring stationswere presented as daily dose rate recordings in 1985-1986, the rate ofdecrease of the excess dose rate demonstrating quite large variationsin the period from May to August. This indicated that the compositionof the short-lived nuclides in the fallout varied from place to place.The influence of the meteorological conditions were reported with precipitationdata from six days after the accident. There was a clear correlationbetween the results from precipitation and radiation measurements indifferent parts of Finland.</TEXT></DOC>
