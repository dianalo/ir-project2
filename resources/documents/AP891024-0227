SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Worrying about the threat of global warminghas become a major preoccupation among environmental groups andthink tanks, but in the scientific community not everyone is quiteso willing to run for cover.   The ``greenhouse effect'' is threatening to raise temperatures,melt the polar ice caps, change climate and generally disruptcivilization, say those concerned about the hazard.   But others point out that just a decade or so ago, similarwarnings were being issued that the world was headed into anotherice age.   Many weather researchers hesitate to pronounce any conclusion onglobal warming, pointing out that too little is known about thethreat to make a judgment.   In an effort to sort out the problem, a coalition of governmentagencies has launched a research effort that could extend overseveral years.   Among those taking part are the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, the Geological Survey, the Defense Department, theCouncil on Environmental Quality, the National Science Foundation,the Agriculture Department, the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration and the Environmental Protection Agency.   While the theory behind the greenhouse effect seems prettysimple, it's like a lot of other theories _ the reality is morecomplicated than the hypothesis.   The theory goes like this: Industrial processes over the lastcentury have spilled a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Although carbon dioxide is colorless, odorless and essentiallyharmless by itself, it slows the passage of heat. Having extracarbon dioxide in the air means light can come in and warm theEarth, but heat can't go back out as easily as it once did.   Thus, the theory is that the Earth should warm up because of theextra carbon dioxide. It's called the greenhouse effect because ofthe trapping of heat by the atmosphere, somewhat like the trappingof warmth by greenhouse glass.   Recent warm summers increased concern about this possibility,and some eminent scientists have raised the possibility of ahazardous overheating.   These include G.O.P. Obasi, head of the World MeteorologicalOrganization, James Hansen of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration and Stephen Schneider of the National Center forAtmospheric Research.   A spate of worrisome reports, studies, analyses andrecommendations has come from such wide-ranging groups as theWorldwatch Institute, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the U.S.Chamber of Commerce and Zero Population Growth.   Yet, voices are increasingly being heard on the other side ofthe issue, especially in light of reports seeming to show a reducedthreat.   ``It's obvious that the most recent scientific results aredrastically cutting the estimates of global warming,''climatologist Patrick Michaels of the University of Virginia saidin a telephone interview.   ``The more realistic climate models have more than halved theestimates of prospective warming, and when compared to observedtemperatures it still appears that these may be overestimates,''Michaels said.   ``It's intriguing to me that people with interventionist pointsof view tend to neglect the most sophisticated scientificfindings,'' he concluded.   The effect of clouds on the warning threat has been a majorfactor in recent studies.   Computer models of the climate have been the source of many ofthe concerns about the warming but many models have little abilityto include clouds. Indeed, until recently opinions were mixed overwhether clouds would cool the Earth or add to the heating.   But new studies have found that, overall, clouds have a coolingeffect by blocking incoming sunlight. How much cooling will resultremains to be seen. Some scientists say the clouds could cut thethreatened warming in half.   And if warming does occur it could result in more evaporation ofwater, making more clouds, so a new balance could be reached withonly little global warming.   Computer models trying to find this balance disagree with oneanother, however, leaving many scientists unwilling to recommendanything beyond more research.   They warn that a few hot years don't make a trend, just as thehot summers in the 1930s didn't mean global warming was imminentand the cooling trend from 1940 to 1980 didn't mean another ice age.   Some climate warming reported over the last century could haveresulted from changes in the brightness of the sun, commentedRobert Jastrow, former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for SpaceStudies.   ``Forecasters cannot rely on the temperature increase observedin the last 100 years as an indicator of greenhouse warming in thenext century,'' said Jastrow.   Other studies have indicated that reports of increases inaverage temperature over the last 100 years may even beexaggerated. National Climatic Data Center studies found that inmany cases temperature records are kept in cities that haverecorded rising temperature as they grew larger and more crowded.   ``We are confronted with an inverted pyramid of knowledge; ahuge and growing mass of proposals for policy action is balanced ona handful of real facts,'' said Robert M. White of the NationalAcademy of Engineering.   Writing in the September issue of the Bulletin of the AmericanMeteorological Society, he asked:   ``Can we arrest or slow the processes that increase theconcentrations of greenhouse gases? The answer is yes. But we haveno grasp on the social and economic ramifications of intervention.''   Nonetheless, many environmentalists continue to advocate actionon the theory that by the time science can give conclusive answersit may be too late to slow the warming trend.   ``Clearly, society does not have the resources to hedge againstall possible negative future outcomes,'' concedes Schneider at theatmospheric research center.   But, he says, while research continues ``society should pursuethose actions that provide widely agreed social benefits even ifthe predicted change does not materialize.''   Prime among those suggestions is improved energy efficiency thatreduces release of carbon dioxide and also cuts down on energycosts and air pollution. Other steps would include developingalternative technologies and testing new crop strains.   Waiting for scientific consensus, he contends, could allow thewarming to speed up out of control, forcing society to face an evenlarger and faster growing problem than is already feared.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 29</NOTE></DOC>
