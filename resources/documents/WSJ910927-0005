A sort of NewAge Natty Bumppo, Billy Jack dressed in black, danced withrattlesnakes, and memorably failed to check hiskarate-chopping ways when bigoted townspeople terrorizedchildren at a multiracial pacifist school.</LP><TEXT>   Now Billy Jack, or rather Mr. Laughlin (he doesn't alwaysdraw a sharp distinction between the two) is preparing toseek the Democratic nomination for president. He has madeseveral trips to Iowa, is planning to visit New Hampshire,and on Tuesday told reporters at a Washington pressconference, &quot;I want to run for president.&quot;   Looking stockier than he did in the Billy Jack films, Mr.Laughlin, 60 years old, stopped short of a formalannouncement, which he says he will make within two weeks.But he left little doubt of his intentions, dispatching swiftkarate kicks at President Bush and Iowa Democratic Sen. TomHarkin, among others, and stating at one point that he has a&quot;moral obligation to give the people a chance to elect anoutsider&quot; for president.   Like the Billy Jack films, which included thenever-released, possibly prophetic &quot;Billy Jack Goes toWashington,&quot; Mr. Laughlin's platform is a hodgepodge ofliberal and conservative themes. Where &quot;Billy Jack&quot; combinedpreachings on civil rights, pacifism, and progressiveeducation with John Wayne-style violence, candidate Laughlinfavors greater environmental protection and national healthinsurance -- but also the elimination of Saddam Hussein.   Mr. Laughlin's candidacy is the latest reminder of theblurring line separating politics from the media. At a timewhen one potential candidate, Jesse Jackson, faces the choiceof running for president or becoming a TV talk-show host, Mr.Laughlin is drifting into a presidential campaign that beganas a movie project.   &quot;I'm not sure I take this as entirely a political thing,&quot;says political commentator Kevin Phillips, noting that Mr.Laughlin could be &quot;trying to make a movie comeback in 1993.&quot;   Mr. Laughlin insists he is for real and that the film ison hold. But he concedes that he was still planning to makethe movie when he lured Iowans last summer to public meetingswith advertisements describing himself as the creator ofBilly Jack and a &quot;potential presidential candidate.&quot; Onlywhen they arrived did Mr. Laughlin inform them that he wasplanning a film about a Norman Schwarzkopf-like general whoreturns home from war.   The advertisements drew such large crowds, Mr. Laughlinsays, and exposed him to so much voter anger, that he decidedto begin a political movement instead of making a movie. Hestarted an informal issues group in Malibu, Calif., calledthe American Voter Revolt. And when he presented his findingsto Bruce Babbitt, Mr. Laughlin says, the former Arizonagovernor urged him to drop the movie and run for office.   That's not exactly how Mr. Babbitt remembers it; he sayshe never advised Mr. Laughlin &quot;one way or the other.&quot; Still,he says he was very favorably impressed. &quot;I was expecting afilm director,&quot; he says, &quot;and I met a very serious andinteresting guy.&quot;   Mr. Babbitt likens Mr. Laughlin's presidential candidacyto that of Jack Tanner, the mythical hero of the cable TVseries, &quot;Tanner 88,&quot; in which several 1988 presidentialcandidates, including Mr. Babbitt, appeared. Where the formerwas fiction that drew on real life, he says, &quot;now you've gota real candidate&quot; who started out as a character in a movie.</TEXT></DOC>
