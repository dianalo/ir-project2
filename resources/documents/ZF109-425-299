The TV screen went white with snow and the audio sounded as if TammyBaker (American televangelist's wife who is known more for her shopping andmakeup than her voice) was practicing scales.andM;This painful incident reminded me that all those office-grade computers in myhome office were pumping out radio interference at a remarkable rate and ledme to check with my neighbors, all of whom either use satellite receivers(and are thus virtually immune to local interference) or are far enough awaythat they haven't experienced trouble with my equipment.andM;I didn't check with the guy across the road who has souped up his citizen'sband radio with a monster amplifier and thereby made it nearly impossible toreceive any local TV stations anyway.andM;Well, all this checking was mostly a courtesy since I live in a totallyunzoned area where you can keep pigs (two doors over they do), repair dieseltrucks (across the road), or make and sell monstrously tacky lawn ornaments,all without fear of local zoning boards, but I was still pleased to learnthat I hadn't been causing trouble to any of my neighbors (all of whom keepguns and big dogs; I only feel safe here because my dogs are the biggest inthe township).andM;What all this is leading up to is a discussion of FCC Class A and Class Binterference ratings for electronic equipment.andP;  You see, with computersoperating in the megahertz frequency range, they make great transmitters ifcompanies aren't careful how they design them.andM;Here in the U.S.andP;  the Federal Communications Commission tests and licensescomputers as Class B if they are relatively radiation- free.andP;  Canada has asimilar scheme.andM;Under U.S.andP;  law you can't advertise, sell, or lease computer equipment, foruse in the home, which doesn't meet Class B ratings, but very few peoplebuying computers, especially those who order by mail, are aware of the needfor Class B certification.andM;Class A computers normally cause much more interference and are suitable foroffice environments.andP;  Here in the country there are only a few houses closeenough to me to be affected anyway, but pity the poor apartment dwellerswhose neighbor gets a business- class computer for his den.andM;Here and in many other places, it is up to the computer owner to eliminateany interference his equipment causes; thus, it might be a good idea to stickwith Class B computers in crowded areas, even if you aren't worried aboutpossible health effects from stray radiation.andM;By the way, in the U.S.andP;  the testing and licensing of computers has beencarried to such an extreme that it is difficult for a small computer builderto get a new product to market because of the costs and delays involved ingetting FCC approval.andP;  Since all you basically need to learn if a computercauses interference is to set an old TV with rabbit ears next to the computerin question, the FCC's testing procedure seems a bit more onerous thannecessary.andM;That test wouldn't be as complete as the one performed by the FCC, but thenpeople have been trying to shut down our neighbor with the overpowered CB foryears and we haven't gotten any help from the FCC yet, so perhaps a bit lesstime spent on exhaustive testing and a bit more on enforcement might be inorder.andM;(John McCormick/1990622)</TEXT></DOC>
