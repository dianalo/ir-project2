 IRM ExecutivesandM;These days, quite a few senior information resources management executivesare considering alternate career paths.andP;  The twin pressures of compensationbelow private-sector levels and increasing employment restrictions imposed bythe ethics in procurement regulations are taking their toll.andM;These highly experienced IRM managers are becoming frustrated and may belooking for the exit.andP;  Where can such valuable people go?andM;They can seek positions in the private sector, capitalizing on their know-howin managing complex information systems.andP;  Alas, reality is not that simple.andO;Corporate restructuring and a difficult business climate in several sectorsof the U.S.andP;  economy have cut into systems budgets.andM;Thus, the prospects for job-seeking federal IRM executives in the corporateMIS world are not all that bright.andP;  In addition to a dwindling pool of suchpositions, they must contend with MIS managers being displaced within thebudget-conscious private sector.andM;Forget about getting an appropriate position in the computer industry, saywith one of the systems vendors.andP;  The U.S.andP;  information technology sector,with a few exceptions mostly on the software side, is in a protracted slumpthat shows no signs of easing.andP;  Many companies have frozen hiring and arecajoling their excess management talent to take early retirement.andM;In light of these conditions, the idea of going into business for themselvesis occurring to quite a few federal IRM executives.andP;  For one thing, they knowof the success stories written by their predecessors, such as the founders ofAmerican Management Systems Inc., BDM, Advanced Technology Inc. and VanguardInternational.andP;  Not unreasonably, they conclude that what could be done thenstill can be done now.andM;Certainly, worthwhile opportunities in the high-tech sector awaitexploitation by qualified entrepreneurs.andP;  But today the going is tougher thanit was during the computer industry-s heydays, the golden period of the1960s, '70s and early '80s.andM;Today much of the romance has gone out of high technology, replaced bycynicism and hard-boiled bean-counting.andP;  Starting a computer company today --even even one in the fast-growing software or services sector -- is risky,requiring sharp business acumen and flawless execution.andM;Forced mergers are becoming more frequent.andP;  One example is the recentcombination into Stardent of Ardent and Stellar, two start-ups in thesuper-powered graphics workstation field.andP;  To put it bluntly, being in thecomputer business is no longer fun and games with easy fortunes at the end ofthe rainbow, but rather an energy-draining daily battle.andM;Nevertheless, a hard-driving, highly motivated entrepreneur with a good ideaand the right credentials can make it.andP;  But to succeed, he had better learnhow to deal with the venture capitalists.andM;These obnoxious fellows must be accommodated.andP;  They provide the start-upfunds through equity participation, as well as valuable business guidance.andM;Entrepreneurs typically make at least two big mistakes.andP;  Despite theirdisclaimers, their assumptions about commencement of revenues and supportingcost levels often are unduly optimistic.andM;Second, in forming the management team they tend to rely on businessassociates with backgrounds similar to their own, rather than building a teamwith skills in all aspects of management.andM;Because of the optimistic bent to the entrepreneur's plan, unless detectedand modified by the participating venture capitalists, break-even cashflowmay not be reached on schedule and a second round of financing will be neededsooner than planned.andP;  Unless the cash crunch is attributable tobetter-than-planned market acceptance of the new product or service, havingto go back to the well for more financing is awkward.andM;The venture capitalists will demand an arm and a leg to come in, or they maywithhold further support for the start-up enterprise, forcing it to sell outat distress prices or close its doors.andM;IRM executives thinking of starting a business should step cautiously.andO;Coming out of the cocoon of secure government service with its vast supportsystem is no preparation for the tough world of entrepreneurial capitalism.andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
