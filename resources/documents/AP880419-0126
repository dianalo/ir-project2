Anware and her 22-year-old sister, Ibtesam, are the only twowomen left among the approximately 35 hostages, all thought to beKuwaitis.   It was the first time either of them has been made to plead forthe hijackers' cause.   In a tense but firm voice, Anware said, ``We want you to tellour families that my sister and I and all the passengers are well,although our morale is low.''   ``I hope from my family and government that they will hurry tofree the prisoners. If not, we are all in danger. Thank you.''   It was the fifth time since the plane landed in Algiers earlyWednesday that the hijackers have broadcast appeals from hostagesfor the Kuwait government to release 17 men convicted on terroristcharges in Kuwait.   The pro-Iranian prisoners were responsible for the 1983 attackson the U.S. and French embassies in the Persian Gulf sheikdom.   Another of the emir's cousin, Fadel Khaled Al-Sabah, believedsuffering from a nervous disorder, broadcast an almost incoherentbut similar message Sunday.   Kuwait has refused to meet the demand. There has been noapparent break in the stalemate although Algerian mediatorscontinued their active shuttle between the plane and a high-levelKuwaiti delegation.   This morning contact with the Moslem Shiite hijackers began witha request radioed to the control tower. ``Good morning,'' said oneof the hijackers, speaking clearly in English. ``We'd like to havewater for the plane, someone to clean the toilets and newspapers:five in Arabic and three in French. We also need one medicine,interviaform,'' a treatement for diarrhea.   A yellow car carried an airport worker to the plane to fill therequest.   As the Moslem holy month of Ramadan began on Monday, thehijackers requested copies of the Koran, the Moslem holy book,which were delivered.   During Ramadan, observant Moslems do not eat or drink duringdaylight hours. At the hijackers' request, a traditional pre-fastmeal was delivered to the plane Sunday night for all aboard.   The Kuwait Airways flight from Thailand to Kuwait was hijackedApril 5 with 112 people aboard and forced to land in Mashhad, Iran,where 57 eventually were released. On April 8, the jet flew toLarnaca, Cyprus, where two passengers were killed and 13 freed.Since landing in Algiers one passenger has been freed. The five toeight hijackers are armed with grenades and guns and havethreatened to blow up the plane.   A hostage freed on Thursday, 70-year-old Djumaa Abdallah Chatti,flew out of Algeria on Monday night on a Kuwaiti executive jet.Escorted to the plane by four members of the Kuwaiti negotiatingdelegation, Chatti waved to television cameras before getting onthe plane but said nothing.   The hijackers' only direct threat in Algeria was that madeSaturday when they asked that the plane be refueled so they could``settle our score'' with Kuwait in another country, rather than in``friendly Algeria.''   Radio conversations on Monday made no reference to refueling theplane or leaving Algeria. Radio Algiers said in an Arabic languagenews broadcast on Monday that there was ``hope that a peacefulsolution is still possible'' despite no indication that either sidewould make any concessions.   The oficial radio reported ``new movement that gives a chancefor new elements,'' but did not elaborate.   Algerian officials have been acting as mediators between aKuwaiti delegation and the gunmen, boarding the plane several timesa day for talks.   Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, in charge of the mediationeffort, said early on he had obtained a promise from the hijackersthat they would not resort to violence on Algerian soil.</TEXT></DOC>
