Trisha Moseley and Susanna Colloredo founded International TuskForce, a fledgling group devoted to banning international ivorytrade.   Their goal is to make the buying and wearing of ivory aspolitically unfashionable as eating California grapes during theUnited Farmworkers boycott of the 1960s and 1970s.   ``One of the members of the Tusk Force saw an ivory product inthe catalog of a major department store,'' Moseley said. ``She wasso mad she cut up her credit card and sent it back to them.''   The group, formed in May, puts out a monthly newsletter, with amailing list of about 300 names.   African elephants are threatened by poachers who kill the olderones for their tusks, which often are shipped to the Far East forprocessing into ivory products. Since June, the United States,Japan, the 12-nation European Economic Community, Switzerland andCanada have banned ivory imports.   But Moseley contends plenty of ivory products are still found instores, creating a continuous demand and fueling poaching.   ``The general message is: Don't buy ivory and don't deal withstores that do,'' Moseley said.   As the wife of former state Rep. James Moseley, she knew how toget the attention of politicians. Colloredo also had clout as thewife of Ferdinand Colloredo, who is the former head of a largeBoston real estate firm and president of the influential Bostonbusiness organization known as ``The Vault.''   The two women used their connections to organize a Boston paneldiscussion Thursday on banning the ivory trade, featuringpaleontolgist Richard Leakey. They also organized fund-raisers,complete with appearances by tame elephants, that raised about$30,000.   The money was sent to Operation Meru, a Kenyan conservationproject, Moseley said.   The women and their families went on safari in Africa andlearned from their guides of diminished elephant herds due topoaching.   Moseley has been involved with various conservation causes overthe years, but the plight of the elephant seemed to herparticularly symbolic of concerns over endangered wildlife.   ``If we can't save the elephant, how can we save the rest?'' shesaid.   ``A lot of people's reaction is, `Why worry about elephants whenpeople are starving?' This is a good question for people to ask,''Moseley said. ``The elephant can help the people if properlymanaged.''</TEXT></DOC>
