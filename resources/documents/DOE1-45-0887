Brakeservicing of seven vehicles at the Cincinnati Bell Fairfax Garage wasstudied. Phase contrast microscope (PCM) analyses of personal air samples,collected for the duration of a single brake job or for 2 hours, whicheverwas longer, yielded counts ranging from 0.004 fiber per cubic centimeter(f/cc) (detection limit) to 0.016f/cc using an aspect ratio of 5:1. Effectivecontrol was evidenced by the low exposures for the brake mechanics; 79%of the air samples, including personal, axle, fender, background, andambient samples were below detectable limits. Transmission electron microscopyalso showed very low asbestos concentrations. The authors caution thatworkers should not use a dry cloth to clean hands after finishing a brakejob. Instructions are offered for safe removal and replacement of thevarious filters in vacuum units.</TEXT></DOC>
