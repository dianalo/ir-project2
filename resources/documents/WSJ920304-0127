To his credit, however, William J.Broad, a Pulitzer Prize-winning science reporter for the NewYork Times, has written a critical but generallydispassionate account of the remarkable career of Mr. Teller,the father of the hydrogen bomb, who went on to become theforemost advocate among scientists of Ronald Reagan'sStrategic Defense Initiative.   In &quot;Teller's War: The Top-Secret Story Behind the StarWars Deception&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster, 350 pages, $25), Mr. Broadsketches a fascinating portrait of the bushy-eyebrowedHungarian emigre, &quot;an idea man, a romantic, a visionary,&quot; whofirst made a name for himself as a brilliant theoretician inthe making of bombs. He was present at the start-up of theManhattan Project, worked on the nation's first nuclearreactor, figured out how to fuse atoms into the H-bomb, andfounded his own nuclear weapons laboratory in Livermore,Calif.</LP><TEXT>   Along the way, Mr. Broad argues, Mr. Teller's boundlessenthusiasm, hypercreativity and overweening ambition led himto exaggerate what could be achieved technically in his lab.This would have been an unexceptional flaw were it not forthe fact that Mr. Teller seemed to have placed himself beyondthe bounds of scientific checks and balances. According tothe author, the physicist ruled Livermore as his personalfiefdom, ignored outside colleagues who might have challengedhis judgments, and traded on a vast network of politicalconnections in Washington.   This section of the book is surely oversimplified. Greatmen, especially contrarians like Mr. Teller, don't go throughlife without making enemies, and Mr. Broad seems to havelocated all of Mr. Teller's. Moreover, Mr. Teller's advocacyof a vigorous defense put him at odds with the softer viewsof the scientific establishment. Perhaps the subject shouldhave consented to speak with the author.   In Mr. Broad's view, Mr. Teller's final act, cheerleadingfor ballistic missile defenses, was an attempt to offset thespecter of &quot;nuclear genocide&quot; that hung over most of hiscareer by devising a way to protect against nuclear warheads.This foray into pop psychology, however, doesn't account forplainer motivations: countering the then-frightening Sovietoffensive military buildup, and breaking out of the bizarrepolicy of mutually assured destruction.   In 1983, partly on Mr. Teller's advice, President Reaganannounced SDI, with the unrealistic goal of making nuclearweapons &quot;impotent and obsolete.&quot; Mr. Reagan wanted not toenhance deterrence, but to obviate it with a perfectterritorial defense. The military bureaucracy, the armscontrollers and their agents in Congress opposed SDI becauseit threatened the status quo, and so they conspired toconfine it to the research lab.   Mr. Broad shows how Mr. Teller's pet SDI project, an X-raylaser powered by nuclear blasts that would zap down enemymissiles, satisfied both Mr. Reagan and the critics. If itworked, thousands of beams would make up a &quot;shield that wasvirtually leakproof,&quot; but the laser entailed a mammothresearch and development effort, and thus would remainundeployable for years to come. In advancing the exoticlaser, Mr. Teller outmaneuvered advocates of more modestanti-missile weapons -- space-based chemical lasers and smallinterceptor rockets -- that could have been deployed rapidlyand provided the U.S. with partial protection, enough todeter a Soviet first strike.   This quest for perfection is why the U.S. has spent $25billion to date on SDI and doesn't have a widget to show forit.   Whether Mr. Teller pulled off a massive &quot;Star Warsdeception,&quot; however, is not firmly established. The X-raylaser turned out to be a turkey. But how was the Pentagon toknow what would and would not work without spending somemoney to find out? Secondly, Mr. Teller -- a part-timedirector emeritus at Livermore in the 1980s -- apparently hadlots of help in overselling the laser from the lab'ssalivating officials, including those who later turnedagainst him and spoke at length to Mr. Broad. And finally,Mr. Broad ignores the geopolitical benefits of the lasereffort: It scared the bejesus out of the Soviets.   By 1987, Mr. Teller had issued a mea culpa on the laserand began to push the development of smart rocks that couldhome in on a much smaller percentage of enemy missiles andknock them out. Mr. Broad regards this promising idea asanother hoax, but here his case is weak, built mostly on hispersonal opinion that strategic defense in any form is bothfanciful and dangerous (an obvious non sequitur).   The Persian Gulf War, of course, proved Mr. Broad wrong onboth counts. Other pipe dreams notwithstanding, defendingagainst ballistic missiles is a sensible thing to do. SDIresearch is now being marshaled to build a limited defensivesystem for the U.S., to guard against an unauthorized oraccidental missile launch or an attack by a wild-eyed ThirdWorld dictator. This may prove to be Mr. Teller's truelegacy, better late than never.   ---   Mr. Brock, a journalist in Washington, D.C., is writing abook on Congress and foreign policy.</TEXT></DOC>
