In a related development, the Beirut weekly Ash-Shiraa saidBritish hostages probably will be released soon, but that therelease of German and U.S. hostages will take more time.   ``In the past 3{ years, I have tried my very best to pressure mygovernment to negotiate for Terry's release and the release of theother hostages,'' Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said in her message.   ``You have now presented new demands which are impossible for meto put forth to my government,'' wrote Mrs. Say, who lives inKentucky.   The text of the message was published by Beirut's two leadingdaily newspapers, An-Nahar and As-Safir.   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing andbelieved kidnapped in Lebanon.   The pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, which holdsAnderson, 40, and American hostage Thomas Sutherland, 56, releaseda statement Thursday that set four demands for their release.   Two of the demands were new: the unconditional withdrawal of allIsraeli forces and their Christian militia allies from southLebanon and U.S. aid for the reconstruction of war-ravaged southLebanon and Beirut.   The group also demanded the release of all Lebanese andPalestinian Mujahedeen, or holy warriors, from prisons in Christianeast Beirut as well as in Israel and its self-designated securityzone.   Israel and allied militiamen of the South Lebanon Army control a10-mile-deep enclave in south Lebanon to prevent cross-borderguerrilla forays.   Unlike many of its previous communications, the Shiite Moslemfaction did not specifically ask for the release of 17 suspectsheld in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in 1983.   ``I think it is grossly unjust for you to hold Terry Andersonfor ransom that includes what amounts to a complete peacesettlement in the entire region and the end of centuries-oldhostilities,'' Mrs. Say stated.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokeswoman PhyllisOakley reiterated U.S. policy against making deals for hostages.``We believe that arrangements that reward hostage takers onlyencourage more terrorism,'' she said.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Sutherland, acting dean ofagriculture at the American University of Beirut, was grabbed June9, 1985.   An anonymous caller on Wednesday claimed Islamic Jihad was alsoholding Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, 48, who disappeared Jan.20, 1987, while in Beirut to negotiate with the group on releasingthe American hostages. There was no way to verify the claim.   Ash-Shiraa, quoting an unidentified west Beirut leader involvedin ``contacts under way to free foreign hostages in Lebanon,'' saidthese ``contacts have made much progress.''   It said two sets of negotiations were being carried onseparately: ``the first involving the release of ... Waite and twoBritish hostages, the second concerning the release of West Germancaptive Rudolf Cordes and the ... American hostages.''   It said the case of the British hostages was ``cooking on a highburner, while the affair of Cordes and the American hostages iscooking on a slow burner.''   The report in Ash-Shiraa, which broke the story of U.S. secretarms sale to Iran in November 1986, could not be independentlyverified. The magazine's previous stories about the hostages havenot proved accurate.   Cordes, 53, Beirut manager for Hoechst AG, one of West Germany'slargest chemical companies, was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987. Thepro-Iranian Holy Warriors for Freedom claimed his abduction.   Ash-Shiraa said the kidnappers were seeking a huge sum of moneyto be paid to them, and ``and at the same time economic, militaryand political conditions set by Iran would be met.'' It did notelaborate.   In addition to Waite, Britain seeks the release of journalistJohn McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dualBritish and Irish nationality whose release is also sought by theIrish government.   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, aNew York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claimthey killed him. His body was never found.   British government sources in London said Friday that the firstBritish diplomat sent to Iran for a year has not been allowed tovisit two Britons jailed without trial.   Earlier, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported that diplomatDavid Reddaway's mission has ``run into trouble.''   Reddaway went to Iran soon after the Church of England heldtalks with an Iranian envoy over the British hostages in Lebanon.The talks and the Reddaway mission raised hopes that the hostagesmight be released.   British government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,said they were disappointed by Iran's continued refusal to allowReddaway to see businessman Roger Cooper, who has been in prison inIran nearly three years, and tourist Nicholas Nicola.</TEXT></DOC>
