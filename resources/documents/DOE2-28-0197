Estimates are alsoprovided to show what the human exposure and risk would be via inhalation,dermal contact, and ingestion of contaminated soil. Part One presentsan update of previous work and an analysis of key issues related to exposureassessment for chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins with emphasis on 2,3,7,8-TCDD,such as the behavior of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in soil and sediment, bioavailabilityfrom soil, the use of pharmacokinetics for estimating 2,3,7,8-TCDD exposures,and plant uptake. Part Two addresses the application of exposure-assessmentmethods discussed in Part One, in evaluating 2,3,7,8-TCDD exposures fromselected situations. Twenty different exposure scenarios, covering contaminatedsoil, landfills, and incineration are presented. Human exposure and riskcalculations are then computed under each pathway for the different scenarios.</TEXT></DOC>
