The imported gas would continue to be supplied byShell or such supply sources as may become available and sold by Salmonon a short term or spot basis to, among others, industrial end users, agriculturalusers, electric utilities, pipelines, and local distribution companies.Salmon incorporated by reference the exhibits contained in Salmon's originalapplication dated September 18, 1985 (ERA Docket No. 85-18-NG). The incorporatedinformation thus would include assertions that each sale will be marketresponsive and that the imports would be accomplished using existing pipelinecapacity and no new construction would be involved. Salmon also would continueto file reports with FE within 30 days after the end of each calendar quartergiving the details of the individual transactions. Salmon's prior quarterlyreports filed with FE indicate that approximately 11.3 Bcf of natural gaswas imported under Order 217 through September 30, 1989.The decision on the application for import authority will be made consistentwith the DOE's gas import policy guidelines, under which the competitivenessof an import arrangement in the markets served is the primary considerationin determining whether it is in the public interest (49 FR 6684, February22, 1984). Parties that may oppose this application should comment in theirresponse on the issue of competitiveness as set forth in the policy guidelines.The applicant asserts that this import arrangement will be competitiveand thus in the public interest. Parties opposing the arrangement bearthe burden of overcoming this assertion.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance</ITAG>The DOE has determined that compliance with the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321, <T3>et seq.,</T3> can be accomplished by means of a categorical exclusion.On March 27, 1989, the DOE published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 12474) a notice of amendments to its guidelinesfor compliance with NEPA. In that notice, the DOE added to its list ofcategorical exclusions the approval or disapproval of an import/exportauthorization for natural gas in cases not involving new construction.Application of the categorical exclusion in any particular case raisesa rebuttable presumption that the DOE's action is not a major Federal actionunder NEPA. Unless the DOE receives comments indicating that the presumptiondoes not or should not apply in this case, no further NEPA review willbe conducted by the DOE.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable, and written comments. Any personwishing to become a party to the proceeding and to have the written commentsconsidered as the basis for any decision on the application must, however,file a motion to intervene or notice of intervention, as applicable. Thefiling of a protest with respect to this application will not serve tomake the protestant a party to the proceeding, although protests and commentsreceived from persons who are not parties will be considered in determiningthe appropriate action to be taken on the application.

Additional procedures will be used as necessaryto achieve a complete understanding of the facts and issues. A party seekingintervention may request that additional procedures be provided, such asadditional written comments, an oral presentation, a conference, or trial-typehearing.

Any request for a conference shoulddemonstrate why the conference would materially advance the proceeding.Any request for a trial-type hearing must show that there are factual issuesgenuinely in dispute that are relevant and material to a decision and thata trial-type hearing is necessary for a full and true disclosure of thefacts.
