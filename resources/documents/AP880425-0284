The computer, developed by Advanced Products and TechnologiesInc., of Redmond, Wash., is voice-activated (there's no keyboard)and weighs less than 4 pounds. Depending on the cartridge beingused, Voice converts some 2,000 English phrases into French,German, Spanish or Italian for display on the screen.   The $1,500 device does not translate back into English. However,says Steve Rondel, the manufacturer's president, it does allowrudimentary communication without previous language study or the``inconvenience'' of phrase books.   To operate the system, a traveler inserts two cartridges, oneprogrammed to recognize the voice pattern of the user and the othersupplying the translation.   Among other ``high-tech'' travel products is a calculator called``Travel Helper,'' from Sharp Electronics, that converts currency,tells time in two time zones and includes an alarm clock.</TEXT></DOC>
