(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two men who dug a beached ship out ofthe sand face federal charges they damaged the home of theendangered Alabama beach mouse.   Thomas Bagwell and Melvin McPherson were cited with vehicletrespass and damaging critical habitat of an endangered species,which can net each up to a $500 fine, said Jerome Carroll, managerof the Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge.   Bagwell said he checked with the sheriff's office beforeremoving the boat but didn't know he needed permission from theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   He said the removal of the 38-foot vessel in June at request ofits owner actually helped protect the environment because it was``full of oil and diesel and other debris that would have causedone heck of a mess.''   The mouse, which has a buff-colored back a white belly and is 4inches from head to tail, was added to the Fish and WildlifeService list of endangered species in 1985. The mouse numbers inthe hundreds, Carroll said.   The sand dunes in the refuge are designated by the government asthe ``critical habitat'' of the Alabama beach mouse.   Bagwell described himself as an environmentalist but said hisconcern stops short of rodents.   ``How would you like to have a rat in your pocket?'' he said.``You'd stomp it, wouldn't you?''   Carroll said heavy machines such as a crane and four-wheel drivevehicles were used to pull the the boat out.</TEXT></DOC>
