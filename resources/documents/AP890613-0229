Thornburg told the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force a recent surveyindicates 8,343 bank fraud related matters and cases pending invarious U.S. Attorney's of FBI offices, with 4,000 classified as``major bank fraud.''   ``Over 2,300 of the pending cases were inactive for lack ofadequate investigatory resources or prosecutorial resources, and1,332 of those were classified as major bank fraud,'' he said.   Thornburg urged passage of the Bush Administration's thriftbailout bill, which includes $50 million to investigate major thriftindustry fraud.   He said the added money would allow the Justice Department todouble its bank fraud investigations, adding 200 FBI agents and 100prosecutors and other personnel.   The attorney general estimated that between 25 percent to 30percent of the industry's losses are attributable to fraud.   The Dallas task force is an inter-agency effort to prosecutemalfeasance in the thrift and banking industry. It has come undersome criticism for failed prosecutions.</TEXT></DOC>
