The workers include administrative staff, middle managers, and marketing and sales employees. A spokesman for the group, which employs about 11,000 people, said the company is reviewing its operations and may eliminate some unprofitable products and services. The restructuring should be complete in the next few weeks, he said, and could involve more layoffs.    In addition to concentrating on a few profitable lines, McDonnell Douglas, an aircraft, aerospace and computer company based in St. Louis, has been narrowing losses at the information systems group through cost reductions. Early last year, the group laid off about 3.5% of its employees to cut costs.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, McDonnell Douglas shares closed at $72.25, down $2.25. </TEXT></DOC>
