Inside this Boeing factory, with its immense overheadcranes and three-story-tall jigs, the company builds its 747jumbo jets. Each plane has four engines, six million assortedparts and 175 miles of wiring, but the most important numberis on the bottom line. The 747, analysts figure, accounts forat least 70 cents of every dollar of profit that Boeingearns.</LP><TEXT>   McDonnell Douglas is taking aim at the 747 with a proposednew three-engine aircraft, the MD-12, which boasts animpressive combination of range and payload capabilities.&quot;The 747 is a hell of a plane, but it's vulnerable,&quot; saysHerbert Lanese, McDonnell Douglas's chief financial officer.&quot;If I were Boeing, I'd be very nervous about this.&quot;   Boeing isn't quaking yet. But the company is making movesthat make clear it isn't resting on its laurels as theworld's No. 1 jetliner producer and the nation's leadingexporter. For while Boeing still commands a 60% market share,it finds itself besieged on several fronts.   Besides a pending McDonnell Douglas hookup with TaiwanAerospace Corp. to build the MD-12, the European jet-makingconsortium Airbus Industrie continues to introduce formidablenew products into the market and hasn't yielded in along-running trade war with the U.S. Also, despite Boeing'srosy predictions about long-term jet sales, airlines continueto post sour results, spooking Wall Street and causing thecompany's stock to flag.   Since September, when the price of Seattle-based Boeinghit $53 a share, it has slipped steadily. The stock managedto climb back recently as part of the market's rally, butit's still selling at its lowest relative price-to-earningslevel in a decade. Yesterday, in composite trading on the NewYork Stock Exchange, Boeing shares closed at $48.875, up 50cents, on reports that Bombardier Inc. is about to buyBoeing's de Havilland division.   &quot;At the moment, Boeing is a victim of its own success,&quot;says Howard Rubel, aerospace analyst at C.J. Lawrence Inc.,who rates Boeing a &quot;hold.&quot; In essence, Mr. Rubel explains,investors seem to be saying to the company: &quot;So what ifyou're the market leader? So what if you have a near-recordbacklog? So what if your balance sheet is strong? So what ifyou're probably going to post record earnings this year andnext?   &quot;The real questions are: Where do you go from here? Canyou keep it going?&quot; Mr. Rubel adds.   For their part, Boeing executives maintain that they can.&quot;We don't have our heads in the sand,&quot; says Larry Clarkson,who a few weeks ago was named to the new post of corporatevice president for planning and international development --a promotion that observers interpreted as Boeing'srecognition that it may one day need to make bold movesabroad to counter McDonnell Douglas.   The current challenges, Mr. Clarkson says, simply mean &quot;wehave to knuckle down.&quot; Indeed, in its characteristicallyunderstated way, Boeing is doing just that: cutting costsfrom what is already the industry's lowest-cost operation;revamping production schedules to meet market demand; andconcentrating harder than ever on customer service.   Signs of progress are everywhere, from the more efficientway Boeing has learned to apply a certain sealant on the 747so that a ton of weight is eliminated per aircraft; to a newthree-dimensional computer system the company has installedto simplify the engineering process; to the hundreds ofinterdisciplinary &quot;design-and-build&quot; teams it has created tocut down on costly errors.   Perhaps most important, Boeing is continuing to plow backmoney into its operations. These days, for instance, it'seven noisier outside the Everett plant than inside amidst theriveting, as construction crews add more than three millionsquare feet of space to what already is billed as the biggestfactory in the world. The new area will be used tomanufacture the 777 airliner -- a two-engine, wide-body jetthat will plug one of the only holes in Boeing's productline. The 777, expected to cost about $4 billion to develop,is scheduled to be delivered beginning in 1995.   Still, Boeing is up against a host of forces outside ofits control.   For example, a movement is afoot in Washington state toget Boeing to pay more taxes. Last year, activists arguedthat the company didn't contribute its fair share to statecoffers, and they urged the Legislature to impose a levy onBoeing to fund salary increases for teachers and otherprograms. A company spokesman responds that Boeing directlypaid $500 million in taxes during the 1989-1991 biennium --more than any other firm in the state -- and makes a host ofother vital contributions to the regional economy.   In addition, Boeing's giant defense business is alsofeeling the strain. Although the company has gone a long wayto stemming the flow of red ink from its military operations,it faces substantial cutbacks as the Pentagon budget shrinks.For instance, the company serves as a key subcontractor onthe B-2 Stealth bomber program, which many believe is aboutto be gored by the Bush administration.   The poor economy and the sickly state of many of theworld's airlines have, moreover, cast a pall over Boeing'sfuture earnings power. Lawrence Harris, of Kemper SecuritiesGroup, notes that because Boeing's backlog and cash position&quot;are not likely to grow over the next few years . . .improved earnings are critical in terms of sustainingvaluation&quot; of the stock. The company recently trimmedproduction of its 737 airliner, and many analysts believecutbacks on other lines are inevitable.   &quot;All of us are uncomfortable that things aren't springingback as quickly&quot; as many first believed they would, concedesRichard James, Boeing's vice president for marketing. Butwith a backlog of more than three years of production, hesays, &quot;we're more stable than we've ever been&quot; and haven'tany fears about weathering the downturn.   Mr. James notes that while domestic carriers are havingparticular trouble, as underscored by the recent announcementby AMR Corp.'s American Airlines that it would sharply curbits growth plans, Boeing now does the majority of itsbusiness with healthier airlines abroad. Just yesterday,Boeing won its first order of 1992 when Singapore Airlinesconverted options for four 747 jumbo jets to firm status. Thedeal is valued at $600 million.   How much Boeing may be harmed by McDonnell Douglas'slatest gambit is less certain. Taiwan Aerospace, a nascentventure backed by the private sector and the Taipeigovernment, is supposed to help build the MD-12 at a facilityin Asia, which McDonnell Douglas contends will cut its laborcosts more than 45%. More broadly, Taiwan Aerospace hassigned a tentative agreement to buy as much as 40% of all ofMcDonnell Douglas's commercial jetliner operations in whatthe St. Louis-based company hopes will be just the firstpiece of an Asian-backed consortium, giving it a marketingadvantage throughout the Pacific Rim.   Publicly, Boeing executives give the impression thatthey're unfazed by the Taiwan venture, noting that McDonnellDouglas has failed previously when trying to implement farless complex arrangements. When asked what the deal may meanfor Boeing, Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman, looksimpassive. It shouldn't have &quot;a significant impact,&quot; he says,adding that his only concern is that the enterprise besubject to market forces.   But there's little question that a Taiwanese partnership-- especially if it eventually gives McDonnell Douglas thewherewithal to develop a fuller range of commercial aircraft-- has Boeing spooked. Fundamentally, a successful Taiwanventure would mean that McDonnell Douglas would survive in anindustry that many analysts assumed would soon be reduced totwo major players.   How Boeing will strike back isn't entirely clear. Someanalysts expect a production boost and behind-the-scenesprice cuts on the 747. McDonnell Douglas executives say theyanticipate a strenuous Boeing lobbying effort in Washingtonto try to scuttle the Taiwan deal. And, sure enough, Mr.Shrontz recently sent a letter to senior White Houseofficials, contending that funding for the McDonnell Douglasinitiative by the Taipei government may make it so thatBoeing ends up with &quot;another highly subsidized competitor.&quot;Mr. Clarkson says he can't rule out the possibility thatMcDonnell Douglas's plans &quot;may put pressure on Boeing&quot; toalso form new alliances overseas.   Without any doubt, Boeing is fully committed to dowhatever it believes necessary to try to protect itself.   When Airbus -- now a contender in practically every salesrace Boeing enters -- was being formed two decades ago, &quot;wereally didn't take them very seriously,&quot; says Mr. Clarkson.&quot;We're not about to make the same mistake again.&quot;   ---                   Boeing by the Numbers                                                                                                          The Fundamentals                                                                                                                                                 1990       1989                                                                                                          SALES ($ billions)                    $26.70     $20.28   NET INCOME ($ millions)            $1,390.00    $675.00   EARNINGS PER SHARE                     $4.01      $1.96   MAJOR PRODUCT LINES:                                                                                                          Commercial jetliners, military hardware and spaceequipment                                                                                                          MAJOR COMPETITORS:                                                                                                          McDonnell Douglas Corp. in the commercial sector; NorthropCorp., McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell International Corp.,Grumman Corp., Lockheed Corp., Martin Marietta Corp., andothers in military contracting.</TEXT></DOC>
