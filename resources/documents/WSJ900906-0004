Prosecutors say they plan to urge U.S. District JudgeKimba Wood to consider additional allegations against Mr.Milken when she sentences him. These alleged crimes will bedetailed in a sentencing memo that Judge Wood is scheduled toreceive on Monday in federal court here.</LP><TEXT>   In the April agreement, Mr. Milken, the former head ofDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk-bond department, pleadedguilty to six felony counts related to unlawful trading. Thegovernment didn't agree to recommend any specific sentence,as Mr. Milken's lawyers had hoped.   The government hopes that evidence of additional crimes --presented in the memo and in live testimony by Ivan Boeskyand others -- will induce Judge Wood to dole out a stiffsentence for the crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty.The maximum prison sentence for these counts is 28 years.Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 1.   The U.S. Supreme Court and lower federal courts have ruledin a series of cases that the government may ask a sentencingcourt to consider alleged conduct for which the defendantwasn't convicted and didn't plead guilty. The rulings arecontroversial because they appear to penalize defendants forcrimes the government never proved beyond a reasonable doubtthat they had committed.   The sentencing memo is expected to include charges thatMr. Milken helped prominent savings and loan executives,among others, to defraud the public and violate tax laws, andthat Mr. Milken engaged in commercial bribery with certainmoney managers.   Prosecutors may be particularly eager to air their fullcase because they were recently stung by a pre-sentencereport written by the federal probation agency. That reportis understood to have favored Mr. Milken's position that hiscontributions to society outweighed his crimes. Whileprobation agency recommendations can be very influential inthe sentencing of violent criminals, the recommendation couldbe less significant in this case because there will be somuch additional information presented by both sides.Probation reports are almost never made public.   Prosecutors have held lengthy discussions with attorneysfor Mr. Milken in recent months detailing what they plan tosay in their memo. Mr. Milken's lawyers are expected tosubmit their own memo next week disputing those claims.   A judge isn't obligated to take the government'sadditional allegations into consideration when deciding on anappropriate sentence. But if Judge Wood decides she wishes toconsider the additional evidence in meting out a sentence,Mr. Milken is entitled to defend himself at a hearing.   Lawyers for witnesses who aided the government in its caseagainst Mr. Milken have confirmed that they were told byprosecutors that the government will seek to present the fullforce of its case against Mr. Milken at any such hearing.Prosecutors have told these attorneys that such a hearingcould last for more than three months.   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll, the lead prosecutorin the Milken case, declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr.Milken also declined to comment.   A similar battle over sentencing erupted earlier this yearin the case against Robert M. Freeman, the former head ofarbitrage at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. who pleaded guilty to asingle charge of insider trading. In that case, the judgesaid that in issuing a sentence, he wouldn't consider anycrimes other than that to which Mr. Freeman pleaded guilty.The government alleged that Mr. Freeman committed some 20other crimes.   Robert McCaw, a lawyer for Mr. Boesky, the convictedformer stock trader, said he is watching the situation &quot;withgreat interest, and we'll see what happens.&quot; The governmenthas asked a federal court in Los Angeles to preventplaintiffs' lawyers in a civil suit from taking testimonyfrom Mr. Boesky until after Mr. Milken's sentencing, in orderto &quot;protect&quot; the government's interest in the case againstMr. Milken.   Steve Andrews, the lawyer for James Dahl, a former Drexelbond salesman, said, &quot;We've spoken to the government aboutpotentially testifying&quot; against Mr. Milken. Reid Weingarten,a lawyer for Cary Maultasch, another former Drexel bondsalesman, said, &quot;We have caught wind of the possibility of ahearing. From our vantage point, this is an unfortunatedevelopment that is likely to help neither the government norMr. Milken.&quot;   If these and other witnesses were called, lawyers for Mr.Milken would be allowed to cross-examine them as if they weretrying the case before the jury. But in such hearings, whichare rare, the government's burden of proof is lower than in acriminal trial. It must prove its case simply by apreponderance of evidence, rather than beyond a reasonabledoubt.   Legal experts said the argument for having such a hearingis stronger in the Milken case than in the Freeman casebecause the charges to which Mr. Milken has pleaded guiltyare broad based, and public attention in his case isformidable.   A hearing has drawbacks for both sides. It could exposeMr. Milken to significant public embarassment and furthercivil liability if those he once hired at Drexel are nowforced to testify against him. For the government, a hearingcould further delay Mr. Milken's cooperation with thegovernment's continuing investigation, and would postponeadditional cases prosecutors intend to bring against Mr.Milken's associates. Mr. Milken's lawyers would also likelyattempt to discredit many of the government's witnesses.</TEXT></DOC>
