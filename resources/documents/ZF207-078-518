(optical fiber interconnectnetwork)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Colborn, Kate.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's LincolnLabs have developed a point-to-point interconnect through a laserdiode, a sensitive optical detector and compact disk-sized opticallenses.andP;  The demonstration transmitted a signal directly from agallium arsenide multiplexor integrated circuit to a detector thatmoves directly into gallium arsenide demultiplexer.andP;  Thedevelopment was completed without intervening drivers or recoverycircuit.andP;  The experiment was aimed at ultimately providing opticalconnections from one IC to a second to provide high-speed multipleparallel links with no crosstalk.andP;  Power requirements of opticalinterconnectors need to be worked on to bring the technology toultimate fruition, according to researchers.andP;  The technology wouldreplace revise backplane network connections.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Backbone NetworksCommunications EquipmentTechnologyResearch and DevelopmentLaser and Electro Optics ConferenceOptical ComputersOpticsMassachusetts Institute of Technology.
