More oil is being wasted thereby the fires than in any of the tiny sheikdom's other fields.   Experts familiar with Kuwaiti strategy say thefirefighting effort will focus on that area for at least ayear, though action will probably be taken in somesurrounding fields before all the fires in Burgan are snuffedout.</LP><TEXT>   Before the Iraqi invasion in August, the bulk of Kuwait'sexport crude was pumped from that field, which some expertsrefer to as Kuwait's &quot;bread and butter&quot; field. The oil field,which is about 35 miles long and 15 miles wide, has about 210producing wells, of which 150 are currently burning out ofcontrol, estimates Cambridge Energy Research Foundation,which has been tracking the situation.   &quot;Output from the Burgan field probably accounted for 50%of Kuwait's production&quot; prior to the August invasion, saysKenneth Miller of Purvin andamp; Gertz, energy consultants.   In addition, the fires in the Burgan region have producedthe greatest pollution hazard. A wind that typically blowsfrom the Southwest sweeps the smoke from the fires there overKuwait City and its nearby airport, both of which are onlyabout 12 miles north.   Together with two nearby oil fields, which make up what isknown as the Greater Burgan region, that area contains abouttwo-thirds of Kuwait's 95 billion barrels of reserves. Andnow with many of its wells spewing oil at an uncontrolledrate, there is growing concern that the loss of pressurethere could result in the loss of produceable reserves. &quot;Thelonger those wells blow, the worse the situation gets,&quot; saysDavid Thompson, a firefighter with Houston-based Boots andamp;Coots Inc.   The four firefighting companies that will be working onthe Kuwaiti well fires have already received assignments tofocus on specific wells in the Burgan field, says T.B.O'Brien, president of O'Brien Goins andamp; Simpson, the Midland,Texas, company overseeing firefighting efforts. Firefighterscontinue to arrive at Ahmadi, site of the camp from whichthey're going to launch their efforts.</TEXT></DOC>
