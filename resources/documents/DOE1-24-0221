According to the invention, the ceramic formingthe solid electrolyte has a composition with the formula A1+z1+2z/2/MIz2/MIIz1/A111-z2-z/1/017and by X-ray analysis consists 100% of a fully stabilized beta''-A1203phase. A means an alkali metal, silver, hydrogen or a compound of hydrogen,MI and MII are elements which supply univalent or bivalent ions. Theindices z1 and z2 represent parameters which describe the proportionsof material of the elements or compounds concerned, particularly thoseof A, MI, MII, aluminium and oxygen. z1 and z2 can have values between0 and 1.</TEXT></DOC>
