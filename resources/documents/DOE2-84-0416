Large amounts of C/sub4/ hydrocarbons are produced from steam crackers and catalytic crackers.Some of these C/sub 4/ fractions are isolated for use as chemical rawmaterials. For example, butadiene can be isolated by extraction. Isobutenecan be selectively combined with methanol to make MTBE. To date, onlya few plants use the residual C/sub 4/ raffinate (Raffinate 2) as chemicalraw materials. Most of the Raffinate 2 has been burned as fuel. Untilrecently, a great deal of effort and expense were needed to separatebutene-1 and butene-2 because their boiling points were very close toother C/sub 4/ fractions. But now there is an extractive distillationprocess, the Butenex Process, in which a solvent alters the vapor pressuresof butanes and butenes, thus facilitating--or at least rendering possible--separationby distillation.</TEXT></DOC>
