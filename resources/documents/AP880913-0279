Tamariz said the average price Ecuador gets for its oil has beenranging between $11.88 and $ll.55 a barrel, while the government'sbudget was calculated on an estimate of $17 a barrel.   ``There is a certain weakness in the petroleum market that hasaccentuated in recent days, with a declining tendency,'' Tamarizsaid in a news conference.   Ecuador is one of the smallest producers among the 13 members ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, although oilprovides more than half of its export earnings.   The energy minister said Ecuador planned to ask OPEC to increaseits production quota from 210,000 barrels daily to between 300,000and 310,000 barrels.   Ecuador currently produces 310,000 barrels a day with specialpermission from OPEC, which ends this month. OPEC approved thetemporary increase in Ecuador's production after the countrysuffered devastating economic damage from earthquakes in March 1987.   Tamariz said the market was unstable because of peacenegotiations between Iran and Iraq, which are among the world'smajor oil producers.   Overall OPEC production in August was estimated at 20 millionbarrels a day, nearly 3.5 million barrels over its self-imposedoutput ceiling. The world oil glut, plus speculation that thecease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war could bring even higher production,has helped depress prices below OPEC's benchmark of $18 a barrel.   In addition to Ecuador, the United Arab Emirates is seeking ahigher quota. The U.A.E. has refused to accept a quota of 948,000barrels a day and demanded a 1.5 million-barrel quota, roughly thelevel of its current production.</TEXT></DOC>
