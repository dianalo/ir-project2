Apparentlya good bit more than the typical 17-year-old.   But a good many still were stumped by some questions on afederal education officials' quiz on U.S. history and literature.   Chester Finn Jr., the assistant secretary of education forresearch and improvement, said Tuesday that the PresidentialScholars who took the multiple-choice test answered an average of86 percent of the questions correctly.   That compared with a 48 percent score for 8,000 juniors whoanswered the same questions in 1986 as part of a NationalAssessment of Educational Progress test.   Finn, who co-authored a book about the results called ``What DoOur 17-year-olds Know?'' said it was a respectable showing.   But many of the Presidential Scholars _ some of the nation's tophigh school seniors being honored here this week in four days ofceremonies and seminars _ missed some questions that Finn clearlythought they should have known.   Only 63 percent of the scholars picked ``Speak softly and carrya big stick'' as the phrase that characterized U.S. foreign policyduring the early 1900s. Only 32 percent of the 17-year-olds testedin 1986 got that right. The phrase is a quotation from PresidentTheodore Roosevelt.   Only 48 percent picked Eudora Welty and Flannery O'Connor asauthors known for stories set in the South; the national averagewas 14 percent.   Fifty percent correctly picked Jane Addams as the founder ofsettlement houses to help the urban poor; the national average was41 percent.   Fifty-one percent identified Richard Wright as the author of``Native Son,'' a novel of black life in Chicago; the nationalaverage was 32 percent.   Finn said, ``A hundred and one of you had the courage toactually take this test. This of course skews the results since the20 or so of you who ducked it undoubtedly would have done worse onit. You were not a representative sample even of yourselves.''   At a session hosted by the Education Department for thescholars, he called the 86 percent score ``pretty good,'' but notcause for any swelled heads.   Finn outlined Reagan administration critiques of Americanschools and why it favors merit pay for teachers and other policiesto spur improvements.   When John Kandara of Winston-Salem, N.C., asked about theanxiety that teacher career ladder plans can cause, Finn replied,``In most professions, competition is not considered a vice. Areyou familiar with the Olympics? Indeed, are you familiar withPresidential Scholars?''   ``American kids in general just don't go to school enough,''said Finn, who said a teen magazine generated a flood of letterscriticizing him for a recent article in which he advocatedyear-round schools.   ``The most interesting about the letters was how many wereutterly incoherent,'' said Finn.   Scott Murphy, a scholar from Columbia, Mo., asked how Americanuniversities achieve world eminence ``with students who are so farinferior?''   Finn replied that the best American research universities aresecond to none, but ``an awful lot of colleges are driven by thedynamics of keeping their classes full.''</TEXT></DOC>
