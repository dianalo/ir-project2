Reagan set his first budget director, David Stockman, to workwith a vengeance on the lame-duck spending plan outgoing DemocraticPresident Jimmy Carter submitted in January 1981.   That budget was completely dismantled. Later, Stockman was totrade his budget ax for a pen and do a dismantling job of anothersorts on Reagan and his former colleagues.   Reagan went before Congress on Feb. 18, 1981, with a spendingoverhaul he boasted was a ``program for economic recovery.'' Itcombined the deepest cuts in domestic spending ever proposed, alarge across-the-board cut in income tax rates and a boost inmilitary spending.   By contrast, Bush's overhaul amounts to a little tinkering here,a little adjusting there, to a budget that seemed custom-made forhis modifications.   Where Stockman went through the Carter budget cutting item afteritem, Bush's budget director, Richard G. Darman, went through theReagan budget gingerly adding money to item after item.   Darman wasn't exactly covering hostile territory. He helped putsome of those program reductions in the Reagan budget in the firstplace, apparently knowing full well he'd later be penciling inincreases for Bush's ``kinder, gentler'' society.   A little fancy budgetary footwork, and a proposal to holdmilitary spending increases at the rate of inflation, will enableBush to assert in his budget address on Thursday that he's makinggood on those campaign promises for new initiatives for education,the homeless, the war on drugs and environmental cleanup.   Darman is one of the few senior White House officials who faredwell in Stockman's 1986 book, ``The Triumph of Politics.''   ``His was the only office in the White House where you found awhole table stacked with serious books that the occupant hadactually read,'' Stockman wrote of Darman, then a White Houseassistant.   ``I came to admire his hard-headed, cogent, and zestful approachto political strategy,'' Stockman wrote.   Reagan promised a cut in taxes and a balanced budget by 1983 or1984. Bush is promising not to raise taxes, and to reach a balancedbudget by 1993 with a so-called ``flexible freeze.''   Reagan, obviously, didn't come near a balanced budget. In fact,the annual budget deficit tripled during his presidency, somethingReagan always blamed on Congress.   Now it's Bush's turn, and many economists claim his proposalswon't come close to balancing the budget either _ with or without a``flexible freeze.''   There's actually been the equivalent of a flexible freeze inplace for the past several years, with the growth of federalspending roughly matching the rate of inflation, but few seem tohave noticed.   Furthermore, Bush plans to use many of the same economicassumptions that Reagan plugged into his budget _ and which theCongressional Budget Office and most private analysts claim are fartoo rosy.   These include a projection of economic growth of over 3 percentout through 1994; of a drop in short-term interest rates to 3percent over the same period; and a fall of inflation to under 2percent.   The calculations are important, because if interest rates are onepercentage point higher than estimated, it costs the Treasury _ andincreases the deficit _ $11 billion. For each percentage point thatgrowth lags behind the plugged-in projection, $24 billion is lost.   Stockman claimed he came upon a cruel realization in his fiveyears as director of the Office of Management and Budget: ``Thebudget gap couldn't be closed except by a dictator.''   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, had a more fanciful way oftaking care of the nation's troubled finances.   ``It's all been settled,'' he said emerging from a White Housemeeting with Bush on the budget. ``Peggy Noonan will write thebudget.''   Ms. Noonan is the speechwriter who penned both Bush's conventionacceptance speech and his inaugural address, and who gave him histwo most widely repeated lines: ``a kinder and gentler nation'' and``1,000 points of light.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Tom Raum covers the White House for TheAssociated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
