Nixon, who dealt with then-Soviet leaders Nikita S. Khrushchevand Leonid I. Brezhnev, has also met with President Mikhail S.Gorbachev, describing him as ``in a class of his own. He is theirmatch in tenacity and forcefulness, but outstrips them in realism,quickness and intelligence.''   ``We must keep in mind that his talent and capabilities can justas easily make the world a more dangerous place as they cancontribute to greater global security,'' Nixon wrote of Gorbachev inthe current edition of the magazine ``Foreign Affairs.''   ``While his reforms give reason for a reappraisal of the West'spolicy toward the Soviet Union, we must bear in mind that the causesof the cold war _ Moscow's domination of Eastern Europe andaggressive foreign policies around the world _ still endure,'' Nixonwrote.   ``Those who parrot today a fashionable slogan _ `the cold war isover' _ trivialize the problems of Western security,`` wrote Nixon,who was forced to resign as president in August 1974 during theWatergate scandal.   ``We must make Gorbachev choose between a less confrontationalrelationship with the West and the retention of his imperial controlover Eastern Europe, between a continuing race in arms technologyand arms control agreements that could create a stable strategic andconventional balance, and between access to Western credits andcontinuing Soviet adventures in the Third World,'' Nixon wrote.   In the 20-page article, Nixon offered a host of suggestions forBush.   Key among them were a proposal to meet early with the heads ofU.S. allies to formulate joint arms and trade policies toward theSoviet Union before agreeing to a summit with the Kremlin chief.   ``Gorbachev needs a summit far more than the president,'' saidNixon.   ``It is imperative,'' the former president wrote, that Bush andthe other leaders of the industrialized democracies ``issue a jointstatement, in conjunction with (joint) arms control proposals thateducates their publics on the nature and scope of the Sovietthreat.''   Nixon had some harsh words for former President Reagan because ofproposals that Reagan endorsed at the Iceland summit in 1986 for theeventual elimination of all nuclear weapons and the Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty now under negotiation.   The danger in the draft treaty, wrote Nixon, is that it reducesthe number of U.S. targets more drastically and quickly than it cutsSoviet land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles ``which arefirst strike weapons.''   Bush has suspended those negotiations pending review of all U.S.strategic policies, and White House national security adviser BrentScowcroft, a Nixon aide, has made statements similar to those in the``Foreign Affairs'' article.   Nixon wrote that Bush must repeat his formulation that progressin reducing nuclear arsenals be linked to reducing the sizableSoviet edge in conventional forces.   The American president should demand that any treaty requiresharp cuts in heavy Soviet ICBM's and at the same time move aheadwith deployment of a single-warhead U.S. ICBM. Such a step wouldreduce the number of Soviet warheads and launchers while increasingthe number of U.S. targets, producing greater stability, Nixonmaintained.   Nixon also urged the administration to continue the support ofanti-communist guerrillas in Afghanistan, Nicaragua and Angola, andto press Gorbachev to withdraw Soviet support for pro-Kremlinregimes in those nations.</TEXT></DOC>
