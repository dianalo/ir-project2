Since 1984, The Other Economic Summit, a loose coalitionof environmentalists, Third World feminists, labor andpolitical leaders and citizens groups, have convened justprior to the economic summit of the world's wealthiestnations. TOES, as it is known, strives to be the conscienceof that meeting.</LP><TEXT>   This year, here, populist leaders from the world's poorerregions called for a cancelation of all foreign debt owed bythe Third World, charging debt service has made them &quot;newcolonial tributaries.&quot; Summiteers at the alternative meetingalso called for broader environmental initiatives on toxicwaste, other pollution and the global-warming phenomenon.   Organizers say they will deliver their communiques to theUnited Nations and are attempting to submit it to the U.S.delegation gathered in Houston for the summit ofindustrialized nations, which are the so-called Group ofSeven: the U.S., Japan, West German, France, Britain, Italyand Canada.   The counter-summit was a low-budget contrast to the mainone. Nearly 1,000 participated in the conclave across fromHouston's Astrodome, where President Bush entertained hiswealthy guests Sunday with a welcoming rodeo and comedianMinnie Pearl. TOES summiteers were entertained by Himalayanbell music and a political satirist. A &quot;stress release forworld peace&quot; booth offered up massages to many takers.   While the world's press here for the G-7 summit were fetedand fed at four of Houston's museums this past weekend, thecounter-summit took a handful of reporters to tour shoddyhousing conditions in the city's Fourth Ward, whose clapboardshanties jar into a nearby horizon of gleaming skyscrapers.   A Paris coordinator for last year's TOES summit in France,a socialist democracy, lamented the shrunken participation atthis year's event and the shrunken publicity. &quot;At the end ofthe (Paris) summit . . . because of the press coverage, they(the industrialized nations) had to meet us,&quot; said AnneSophie Boisgallais of Paris.   TOES bills itself as an alternative summit of &quot;seven ofthe world's poorest people,&quot; though eight groups werehighlighted. This year's representatives came fromBangladesh, Haiti, Colombia, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, thePhilippines, and Nigeria. The eighth group, Native Americans,were &quot;observers&quot; to the alternative summit, asrepresentatives of the European Community are observers atthe G-7 summit, an organizer said.   Many conferees came across the border to Texas fromneighboring Mexico. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a 1988 presidentialcandidate in Mexico and the son of a former president, won astanding ovation when he told the crowd that Third Worldnations &quot;don't agree to be treated as merchandise . . . as aterritory to be distributed among industrialized countries.&quot;   Joined in a communique by former presidential candidatesfrom Brazil and Colombia, Mr. Cardenas also said that drugtrafficking is a &quot;transnational business based in the U.S.&quot;and that it can't be used as &quot;an excuse for U.S. military andpolitical intervention in Latin American countries, asrecently happened in Panama.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
