President Alfredo Cristiani promisedflexibility in the peace effort.   The march coincided with Central America's Independence Day andparticipants chanted slogans calling for ``True independence,without Yankee intervention!''   Many of the left-leaning groups that participated consider ElSalvador dependent on the United States and subordinate to it.   Washington has provided more than $3.5 billion in military andeconomic aid to El Salvador this decade, making this couuntry LatinAmerica's biggest single recipient of American assistance.   The aid has been aimed at preventing a victory by the leftistFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front, popularly known by itsSpanish initials _ FMLN.   El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Honduras onFriday celebrated together the 168th anniversary of independencefrom Spain in 1821.   Government and rebel representatives agreed on Friday to openpeace talks next month after two days of discussions in Mexico City,the first such discussions in two years.   Cristiani called the Mexico City agreements ``important accords''on how to proceed toward ending a war that has claimed more than70,000 lives. But he warned: ``While welcoming the dialogue process,we don't want to create false expectations. ... We want to reiteratethat our attitude is one of openness and flexibility within ourconstitutional framework ... We know the road ahead is difficult andcomplex.''   He addressed a small rally of supporters and government officialsin a downtown park.   For the first time since the war started in 1979, authoritiesstaged an Independence Day military parade though the capital. About3,000 troops from the three military branches and the threemilitarized police forces marched to music by military bands.   Crowds lined the parade route, which followed a route differentfrom that of the peace march. But the peace marchers appeared toattract more people, who waved white flags and blue-and-whitenational banners and chanted slogans hailing the upcoming dialogue.   The march was sponsored by the National Debate for Peace, anumbrella organization comprising about 70 church, union, student andhumanitarian organizations.</TEXT></DOC>
