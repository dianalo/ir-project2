Analysts said average profits for each ton of steelshipped in the second quarter will range from $20 to $25 aton, up from about $15 in the first quarter but down from $50in last year's second quarter.</LP><TEXT>   The average second-quarter profits are somewhat skewedbecause of special problems at various steelmakers, includingmaintenance-related outages, one-time charges and start-upcosts of new plants. Excluding those special items, accordingto John Tumazos, a steel analyst with Donaldson Lufkin andamp;Jenrette, major producers would have earned about $30 per tonof steel shipped.   In the second quarter, relieved steelmakers began seeingsteadily improving volume and pricing.   The pricing erosion that began in the second half of 1989appears to have halted, as modest price increases wereannounced and implemented on most key plate and sheetproducts. Still, selling prices, while improved from thefirst quarter, are about $20 a ton lower than a year ago,says Mr. Tumazos.   And while prices are beginning to rise, so are labor, rawmaterial and energy costs. All steelmakers, except industryleader USX Corp., have negotiated higher-cost labor contractswithin the past year. USX, whose contract with the UnitedSteelworkers expires in January 1991, will begin negotiationsin the second half.   Most steelmakers also began to see orders pick up at theend of the first quarter, as car makers began boostingproduction. J. Clarence Morrison, a metals analyst withPrudential-Bache Capital Funding, noted that booming orderscontinued through the second quarter and became morebroad-based, extending to smaller buyers serving the energy,agriculture and equipment-making industries.   Still, those positive factors weren't enough to offsetproblems at some major steelmakers.   Hardest hit was Armco Inc., which expects to post asecond-quarter loss. The company recently announced that itwould take a $70 million charge in the quarter for a juryaward against it, a federal tax assessment and ongoingtoubles at its insurance and financial companies, which arein liquidation.   But even without the charges, analysts said Armco wouldpost an operating loss of about 10 cents to 15 cents a share,compared with last year's profits of $75.6 million, or 84cents, including a $45 million loss from discontinuedoperations. Armco has had trouble with its Brazilianoperations, and lost carbon-steel orders in the quarterbecause of prolonged labor talks.   Meanwhile, earnings at Bethlehem Steel Corp., the nation'sNo. 2 steelmaker, were squeezed by the close-down of itsblast furnace at Sparrows Point, Md., for repairs. Analystsexpect Bethlehem to earn between $10 and $15 a ton in thesecond quarter, compared to $13 a ton in the first quarter.Per share earnings are estimated at about 25 cents a share,down from $1.03 a year ago.   Inland Steel Industries Inc. experienced start-up costsfor its I/N Tek joint venture with Nippon Steel, but shouldbe able to earn about $25 to $30 a ton, compared to lastyear's $56 a ton, analysts said.   USX will likely lead its competitors in profits per ton,in part because the company didn't have any unusual items.The No. 1 steelmaker is expected to earn between $30 and $32a ton, compared to $53 a ton last year, and $23 a ton in thefirst quarter, according to Charles Bradford, an independentsteel analyst.   Some analysts say the third quarter may be the industry'sbest of the year. By then, steelmakers should more fullybenefit from major price increases slated for shipmentsbeginning July 1. And auto-related orders could pick up evenmore in anticipation of a possible strike against the automakers, which begin contract negotiations in September.   The big wild card is imports, which were surprisingly lowin the first half. But a soft world economy, especially incountries like Brazil, and falling spot prices in Europe maylead foreign steelmakers to increasingly seek sales in theU.S. &quot;There's a risk of rising foreign deliveries in secondhalf,&quot; said Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.   And those increased imports could be chasing after fewerorders.   Prudential's Mr. Morrison notes that the industry isheading into a seasonal low. &quot;Can this high level of orderpattern that we've seen lately be sustained?&quot; he asked. Theanswer, he said, may be in the performance of the durablegoods market.</TEXT></DOC>
