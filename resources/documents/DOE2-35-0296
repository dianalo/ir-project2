Closed-form, asymptotic,results for the current density are obtained for arbitrary time-dependentelectrical conductivity of the rails, and v is the speed of the armature.Because of eddy-current effects, the rail current may reverse in portionsof the rails when the total current decreases. The current is used asa source of Joule heating to find the temperature distribution in therails. The heat diffusivity is negligible and gives numerical resultsconcerning melting.</TEXT></DOC>
