But there are some things you can do to ease thestress of traveling with children.   To hentpieces.   ``Taking the right accessories along is easier when you planyour wardrobe and then work your plan,'' says Terrymayer, a NewYork fashion consultant and jewelry designer.   Basics, she says, can be made to fit the occasion with theproper shoes, belt, handbag and jewelry, scarf or hat.   ``A diary of what you have worn with your favorite separates orsuits makes sense,'' she says. ``If you know what you have, you canplan what you need.''   One basic that is coming around again is the shirtwaist dress.   ``Someone once said it has a thousand and one ways of looking,''Terrymayer says. ``It is like adding the dressing to a salad togive it its name.''   The shirtwaist, of course, can be of any one of a multitude offabrics. It can be straight from the shoulder to the shirttail hem,to be cinched by a belt or tie or left loose. Or it can have adefined waistline with one of several skirt styles _ pleated,gathered, flared, straight.   As for accessories, says Terrymayer, ``this is the year of thebangle bracelet. For fashion impact, wear several at once, perhapseven six. It is the time of the charm bracelet, which gives you thechance to show your major interests, on your arm. In the summer,the sea and its charms look so with-it.   ``It is wise to know that it is not the value of the accessorythat counts, but the way you feel about it, for you to give it itsdisplay.   ``What you wear takes on your personality.''   When traveling this summer, says Terrymayer, take along somelightweight colorful earrings, some bangles and perhaps some chainsfor your neck.``Take jewelry you won't have to worry about,'' shesays.``Pack it in a small silk square and tie it hobo fashion.''   And remember that whatever you choose to take, ``its beauty isin the eye of the beholder, and its role is to accent you.''</TEXT></DOC>
