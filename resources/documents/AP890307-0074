Bush, a member of the National Rifle Association, has said heopposes a ban on such guns. In a news conference today, he said hetalked to Bennett about the problem after Bennett was quoted assaying he might favor curtailment of such weapons as a way to cutdown on drug-related violence.   Bush said he told Bennett: ``I'm not so rigid that if you come tome with a sensible answer that takes care of the concerns that I'vefelt over the years, I'll take a hard look at it, and I'll work withyou to that end.''   He said he wants to find ``what can be worked out with finalityon AK47s ... and still do what's right by the legitimate sportsman.''   ``It isn't as easy as it seems,'' Bush said.   Bush was to have gone to Pennsylvania today to speek on drugs,but the trip was scrapped due to the icy and snowy weather thatbattered the East Coast.   On Monday, Bush began a week devoted to an anti-drug message,appealing to military veterans to help combat narcotics byencouraging drug-education programs and anti-drug legislation at thestate and local levels.   ``You've fought for your nation once and your nation needs youagain,'' Bush said in an address Monday to several thousand peopleat a Veterans of Foreign Wars conference.   Bush has asked Congress for $5.5 billion for the battle againstdrugs, with most of the money going to law enforcement efforts andborder interdiction.   His request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 is 21 percentmore than the $4.6 billion allocated for this year. It is $236million more than former President Ronald Reagan had sought in hisfirst draft of the spending plan.   Bush told the veterans that drugs were ``a threat no less realthan the adversaries you have battled.''   ``The notion that America is a nation at peace is only partlytrue, as long as the violence and destructive power of drugs assaultour communities,'' he said.   Bush said he will ``mobilize all our resources, wage this war onall fronts. We're going to combat drug abuse with education,treatment, enforcement ... interdiction and, yes, with our nation'sarmed services.''   Speaking of involvement by the military, Bush said, ``when thatprudently can be done and when that's what it takes, we are going tohave to go all out.''   Bush had planned to carry his anti-drug message today toPennsylvania and Delaware, but a storm along the East Coast causedhim to cancel the trip. White House aides said it would berescheduled, probably for next week.   On another subject, Bush said Monday that he supports ``lowerlevels of armaments'' in Europe but with a continued backup bynuclear weapons.   ``For America and its allies, a survivable nuclear force willremain the ultimate deterrent of aggression,'' Bush said.   His comments coincided with a proposal by the Kremlin for heavyreductions in troops and armor in Europe. Moscow also urgednegotiations to eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from thecontinent.</TEXT></DOC>
