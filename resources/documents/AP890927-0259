(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A savings and loan and two former officershave been indicted on charges of conspiracy, theft and fraud inconnection with the student-loan program, federal prosecutors saidWednesday.   Florida Federal Savings Bank, through its student-loan division,submitted fraudulent insurance claims for 17,000 students totaling$35 million, said Gregory W. Kehoe, assistant U.S. Attorney forFlorida's Middle District.   He said the claims were supported by documents falsely showingthat attempts were made to collect.   Florida Federal received some $18 million from the Department ofEducation before the agency ``shut the door,'' Keohoe said.   Named as defendants with the St. Petersburg-based thrift wereRobert O. Harmas, 42, of Noblesville, Ind. and James J. LaMantia,59, of Largo.   The doctored claims were submitted between Novemmber 1986 andJuly 1987, the 43-count indictment states.   At the time, Florida Federal, formerly Florida Federal Savingsand Loan Association, was the second largest thrift in theSoutheast and the third largest provider of guaranteed studentloans in the country, authorities said.   Harmas was a vice president and operations manager of the loandivision; LaMantia was assistant vice president and manager ofcollection and claims.   The loan program makes low-interest loans available to studentsto pay for postsecondary education. Lenders lend their own fundsand the federal government or a guarantee agency insures againstloss due to default by a borrower.   ``The students never had an opportunity to repay the loans,''Kehoe said. ``There's no evidence the claims or proper documentswere ever sent to them.''   Kehoe said evidence indicated the money went to the bank.   Each count carries a maximum penalty on conviction of five yearsin prison and $50,000. The prosecutor said the defendants wereexpected to surrender.</TEXT></DOC>
