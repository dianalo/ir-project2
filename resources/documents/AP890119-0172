The move also is designed to put an end to what a White Housestatement called the ``significant windfall profits'' Libya hasreaped since the administration imposed the ban on the U.S.operations there in 1986.   In the absence of the American firms, Libyans have been workingthe U.S. oil fields and keeping the income.   The White House and the State Department both said that Reagan'sdecision does not constitute any softening of U.S. sanctions againstLibya.   These include a trade embargo and a freeze on Libyan assets inthe United States. State Department spokesman Charles Redman saidthese restrictions will prevent the oil companies from sending anygoods between the United States and Libya.   The announcement, which came on Reagan's last full day in office,seemed designed to spare the Bush administration a similar decision.   If the announcement had been left to the incoming administration,it could have left the impression among some that President-electBush and Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III wereshowing favoritism toward oil interests. Both had been involved inthat business in Texas.   Asked whether the timing of the announcement was politicallymotivated, Redman said only that the review of U.S. policy had beenunder way since last summer.   The companies affected are Occidential Petroleum, Marathon Oil,Conoco Petroleum, W. R. Grace and Amerada Hess. Their investments inLibya are believed to total in the hundreds of millions of dollars.Before the embargo went into effect, Libya received 51 percent ofthe revenues derived from the U.S. oil operations.   When the administration imposed broad trade sanctions againstLibya in 1986, it authorized the companies to negotiate``standstill'' agreements with Libya.   The agreements, which expire on June 30, provided for thesuspension of company operations to protect the firms from chargesof default on their contractual obligations to work theirconcessions in Libya.   The companies have been concerned that Libyan leader MoammarGadhafi might seize their assets if the agreement expires and thesanctions are not lifted.   ``This decision does not represent a change in the attitude ofthe U.S. government toward Libya,'' Redman said. ``Our view remainsunaltered. Libya still supports terrorism and subversion.   ``It continues to act against the United States and the West. Thechemical weapons factory it has built constitutes a regional menaceand no improvement in U.S. relations can be possible withoutconcrete and durable change in Libya's behavior.''   In a similar vein, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,``We remain deeply concerned about Gadhafi's continued support forterrorism and subversion as well as Libyan efforts to develop achemical weapons capability.''   Redman said the announcement will permit the oil companies toresume their operations in Libya, transfer operations to foreignsubsidiaries or sell their assets if they so desire.   With a trade embargo and strict restraints on travel by Americansto Libya in effect, Redman said the U.S. firms could use thirdcountry nationals and third country goods in their Libyan operations.</TEXT></DOC>
