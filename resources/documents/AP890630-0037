The House approved the measure on an overwhelming 314-101 voteThursday, venting its anger over the situation in China by addingthe sanctions over mild protests from the Bush administration.   The final vote was unusually strong for a foreign aid bill, whichtraditionally engenders little enthusiasm in Congress.   ``This is one of the best foreign aid bills we've passed,'' saidan ebullient Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the seniorRepublican on the Foreign Affairs Committee. ``I've never seenanything like it. There's momentum and confidence and respect byboth parties.''   The measure provides about $11.5 billion each in fiscal 1990 and1991 for military, economic and development aid to dozens offriendly nations around the globe.   As it moved toward final passage, the House adopted an amendmentsoftening restrictions on the administration that were intended tohead off efforts to generate third-country support for theNicaraguan Contra rebels. The Bush administration had warned therestrictions could be grounds for a presidential veto of the entirebill.   With that change, the administration seemed inclined togrudgingly declare victory and work for further changes when thebill goes to the Senate.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the unanimousHouse vote for new China sanctions, said Thursday evening: ``We willreview the bill ... We believe it's unnecessary, but we'll take alook at it when we see it.''   ``We made a lot of progress,'' said one State Department source,speaking only on condition of anonymity. The China sanctions theHouse adopted were milder than the administration had feared from aCongress that has voiced impatience with Bush's cautious response toBeijing's bloody crackdown.   The measure still is far from certain to become law. The SenateForeign Relations Committee has shown little interest in working onits version of the bill this year, often failing to even get aquorum.   On the matter of China, the House endorsed Bush's previous movesto condemn government violence, halt military aid and ban exchangesof military officials and high-level visits.   But the package _ passed on a 418-0 vote _ went a step further,adding suspension of trade and development programs, a ban on thesale of police equipment and a limit on transfer of high-technologyand nuclear materials or components.   ``The Chinese leadership should be aware there is a verydeep-seated revulsion in Congress about the barbarian tactics theyhave employed,'' said Broomfield, who helped draft the sanctions.   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., noted that theadministration opposed the China sanctions as robbing it offlexibility and infringing on presidential foreign policyprerogatives.   But he added: ``I think someone in this government _ and todayit's the House _ has to speak clearly on behalf of the Americanpeople and take more forceful action than the president and thesecretary of state have been to date willing to take.''   Before the vote, Secretary of State James A. Baker III hadrejected the package, declaring that human rights ``is not the onlyprinciple which determines our foreign policy.''</TEXT></DOC>
