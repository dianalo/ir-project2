Volume was extremely heavy at 3.1 millionshares.</LP><TEXT>   The big sell-off marked the second time in as many weeksthat biotechnology investors have been disappointed in theirhopes to profit from a so-called &quot;chemoprotective&quot; drug inthe final stages of development.   Earlier this month, a Food and Drug Administrationadvisory panel sent U.S. Bioscience Inc. shares into a diveafter the panel declined to recommend approval of thecompany's Ethyol drug until U.S. Bioscience gathered moreevidence of the drug's effectiveness in protecting healthycells from chemotherapy.   Still, there's a difference between the delay U.S.Bioscience has encountered and the situation facing MGIPharma: MGI's midtrial halt &quot;until further notice&quot; appears toraise questions as to whether its chemotherapy drug will everreach market. U.S. Bioscience intends to push ahead, and itsproduct -- already ahead of MGI 136 in the arduous paththrough the process that leads to FDA approval -- may as aresult face an easier competitive climate.   MGI Pharma's MGI 136, or diethyldithiocarbamate, has beenconsidered a promising agent against some of the ravages thatcan accompany a widely used therapy based on platinumcompounds. The toxic nature of the therapy forces physiciansto limit the dosage -- and potential benefits -- in order toavoid problems such as kidney and neurological damage.   MGI said yesterday that it was suspending the Phase IIItrial, on &quot;the advice of its independent safety monitoringcommittee&quot; following a regularly scheduled &quot;safety datacheck.&quot; The committee, comprising university oncologists andstatisticians, cited an increase in the number of patientswho prematurely withdrew from the tests.   The data indicated that &quot;patients receiving MGI 136 have adecreased tolerance for therapy,&quot; MGI's statement said,adding that those unfavorable observations &quot;are in markedcontrast to previously reported preclinical and clinicalstudies with this agent.&quot;   The tests were being run under a &quot;blind&quot; system common tosuch trials, said an MGI spokeswoman, and monitors weren'taware of which group was receiving a placebo and which wasreceiving the actual drug. &quot;We were noticing the increase inthe `Y' group withdrawals and those patients' tendency tohave weight loss,&quot; she said, but had to stop the test and&quot;unblind&quot; the results to learn that it was recipients of MGI136 who were dropping out.   &quot;We still don't have the details as to why the weight losswas seen and why they were dropping out,&quot; she said, &quot;The nextstep is to go back into the data&quot; and examine theparticulars.   MGI Pharma, a relatively tiny player in thepharmaceuticals market, has targeted specialty cancertreatments as its niche market. Under a strategy adopted inthe late 1980s, it acquires or licenses products that othershave discovered and put through the initial phases ofclinical testing. MGI then carries the drug through the finaltrials and commercial development.   The company's current product line comprises anintravenous infusion that fights a metabolic disorderassociated with cancer, and a treatment for mouth ulcers thatcan be caused by cancer treatments. MGI said yesterday thatit still expects to &quot;imminently&quot; ask the FDA to approveanother product, known as Salagen, for treatment of a chronicdry-mouth condition that afflicts some radiation-therapypatients.   But it was the perceived potential for MGI 136, and theinterest piqued by the fast-track treatment the FDA accordedU.S. Bioscience's Ethyol, that helped boost the company'sshares late last year. Some analysts had considered that MGIcould garner as much as $50 million in annual sales by themid-1990s, although the Phase III trials weren't scheduled toend until 1993.   MGI sold two million additional common shares at $8.25apiece in the summer of 1991. Its prospectus specified thatalthough MGI 136 had generated &quot;encouraging results&quot; in earlyhuman trials, there was &quot;no assurance&quot; that the currentfinal-phase human trials would prove the drug an effectiveagent, or that regulatory approval for such use would beobtained.   In a release last week, issued in response to U.S.Bioscience's failure to get the FDA panel's go-ahead, MGIsaid it is &quot;confident that the design of our clinical studiesis scientifically sound and will, therefore, continue itsdevelopment until the targeted completion in 1993 or untilthere is a compelling reason -- either good or bad -- to stopthe trials.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
