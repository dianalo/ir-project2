Eligible ApplicantsPriority areas included in this Program Announcement have differing restrictiveeligibility requirements. Therefore, eligible applicants are identifiedin the individual priority area descriptions found in Part B., above.2. Availability of Funds a. FY 89 FundsOCS is spreading its administrative review process more evenly across thefiscal year. In order to accomplish this, OCS is publishing this ProgramAnnouncement prior to the Congress completing its deliberations on appropriationsfor this program for FY 89. Grants will only be made based on the availabilityof funds. The amount of funds available and the expected number of grantsthat will be made when, and if, such funds become available is not knownat the present time.b. Grant AmountsUnder Priority Area 1.0<T3>General Program: </T3>No more than $500,000 will be provided for realestate projects. (Any project that involves, in part or in whole, the purchase,construction or rehabilitation of property will be considered a real estateproject.) Applicants for funding of other activities under this priorityarea are strongly encouraged to refrain from submitting requests for morethan $500,000.<T3>Set Aside Program </T3>(for organizations which received grants underthe FY 87 Pre-Development Program): No more that $250,000 will be providedfor projects funded under this set aside.<T3>Under Priority Areas 2.0 and 3.0: </T3>Applicants requesting fundsunder these priority areas should assure that the total project costs arereasonable in light of the activities to be undertaken. 3. Grant DurationFor most projects OCS will grant funds for one year. However, a grant maybe made for a longer period of time, i.e. up to two years, depending onthe characteristics of any individual project and the justification presentedby the applicant in its proposal. 4. Matching FundsAn applicant is required to obtain commitment of at least the followingamounts of private or public funds to match each OCS dollar awarded: For projects submitted under Priority Area 1.0 (including the $2.5 millionset-aside), two public or private sector dollars are required for eachOCS dollar awarded for real estate projects and two public sector dollarsor one private sector dollar for all other economic development projects.For projects submitted under Priority Areas 2.1 and 3.0, a match of atleast one private of public sector dollar to each dollar of OCS funds awardedis required.For projects submitted under Priority Area 2.2, one private sector or twopublic sector dollars are required for each OCS dollar awarded. Exception: The match for projects submitted under Priority Areas 1.0 and2.2 which will be carried out on Indian Reservations must be at least oneprivate or public sector dollar for each dollar of OCS funds awarded.Matching funds must be definitely committed or contingent only on receiptof the OCS grant. Speculative match, or match based on independent contingencies(such as receipt of another grant or lines of credit at the current marketrate set aside by banks for program participants), will not be countedtowards the matching requirement.Matching fund may be in the form of cash or in-kind fairly converted intotheir dollar equivalent. Some examples are loans for construction financing;mortgages; grants from States, counties, municipalities; contributionsfrom private individuals or organizations; equity investments that aremade to the project supported by the OCS grant; correlated training programs;related water or waste water installations; foundation support; and/orprivate and charitable contributions. OCS will accept as a match Federalmonies from State-administered block grants with compatible purposes whenthose programs do not prohibit their use as matching funds. Examples ofblock grant programs which do not have such a prohibition include the JobTraining Partnership Act, the Social Services Block Grant, and Low IncomeHome Energy Assistance Program.Funds that are eligible to be counted as ``matching'' funds must be committedfor specific project activities within the OCS-approved project and usedonly for project purposes during the duration of the OCS grant. A grantee may not claim as matching funds wages earned as a result of trainingof skill improvements funded by the OCS grant.Funds expended or obligated prior to the approved OCS starting date fora grant cannot be considered as matching funds although currently-ownedassets which will be used in the OCS project may be applied against thematching requirement.While the matching requirement outlined in this section must be met foran application to be eligible for consideration, applicants generatingsupport either greater than that required and/or from private sector sources,may be eligible for additional points to be awarded by the reviewers. Exceptin unusual circumstances, documentation of any commitment of matching fundsmust be in the form of letters of commitment from the organizations/individualsfrom which funds will be received and the commitment must be valid at leastthrough the grant period.<T3>5. Maintenance of Effort</T3>The activities funded under this Program Announcement must be in additionto, and not in substitution for, activities previously carried on withoutFederal assistance. Also, funds or other resources devoted to activitieswithin a community, area, or state should not be diminished in order toprovide the required matching contributions.<T3>6. Administrative Costs</T3>The OCS will accept applications that include administrative costs. However,since grant funds are extremely limited, no awards for only administrativecosts will be made and no more than 10% of the OCS discretionary fundsawarded under a single grant may be used for administrative purposes.Administrative costs are defined as costs that are necessary to protect,monitor, properly account for, and apply to the approved project thoseFederal funds awarded. Costs associated with the internal operational managementof the approved project are not considered to be administrative costs norare costs for conducting the final audit.In all cases where an applicant has negotiated and claims a current indirectcost rate approved by the Department of Health and Human Services, theDefense Contracting Agency, or some other Federal agency, this rate ordinarilywill be recognized by OCS and applied to any OCS grant award. However,it is understood that both administrative and indirect costs are part of,and not in addition to, the amount of funds awarded in the subject grant.In most cases, the approved indirect cost rate will include not only administrativecosts but also other allowable costs that were negotiated under the applicant'sapproved indirect cost rate. Therefore, applicants with an applicable indirectcost rate exceeding 10% of the OCS grant may not propose any administrativefunds in excess of that rate. Thus, although the approved indirect costrate may exceed the normal 10% administrative cost restriction which otherwiseapplies to all OCS discretionary grants, the entire approved indirect costrate will be accepted.<T3>7. Program Beneficiaries</T3>Projects proposed for funding under this announcement must result in directbenefits targeted toward low-income people as defined in the most recentAnnual Revision of Proverty Income Guidelines published by DHHS.Attachment A to this announcement is an excerpt from the guidelines currentlyin effect (1988). Annual revisions of these guidelines are normally publishedin February or early March of each year and are applicable to projectsbeing implemented at the time of publication. (These revised guidelinesalso may be obtained through the U.S. Government Printing Office at thefollowing address: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government PrintingOffice, Washington, DC 20402.)No other government agency or privately-defined poverty guidelines areapplicable for the determination of low-income eligibility for these OCSprograms.<T3>8. Number of Projects in Application</T3>An application may contain only one project (although activities undertakenmay be in a number of communities or impact areas) and this project mustbe identified as responding to one of the program priority areas statedin this announcement. Applications which are not in compliance with thisrequirement will be ineligible for funding.<T3>9. Multiple Submittals</T3>There is no limit to the number of applications that can be submitted undera specific program priority area as long as each application contains aproposal for a different project.<T3>10. Sub-Contracting or Delegating Projects</T3>OCS does not anticipate funding any project where the role of the eligibleapplicant is <T3>primarily </T3>to serve as a conduit for funds to organizations otherthan the applicant.<ITAG tagnum="84">Part D_Application Procedures</ITAG>1.

The narrativeshould provide information on how the application meets the evaluationcriteria in Part D, Section 5.c., of this Program Announcement and shouldfollow the format below:a. <T3>Eligibility Confirmation</T3>. This section must explain how the applicanthas complied with each of the basic requirements listed in Part D, 5.b.(1)-(6), i.e.: (1) That the applicant meets the eligibility requirementsfor the Priority Area under which funds are being requested; (2) the applicationcontains only one project which responds to one of the priority areas inthe announcement; (3) the application clearly targets the specific outcomesand benefits of the project to low-income participants and beneficiaries;(4) the minimum prescribed amounts of private and/or public sector fundshave been firmly committed when such match is required; (5) the amountof funds requested does not exceed the limits indicated in Part C., Section2. for the appropriate priority area; and (6) the application addressesthe purposes described in Part B. of the announcement.b. <T3>Analysis of Need</T3>. The application should include a descriptionof the target area and population to be served as well as a discussionof the nature and extent of the problem to be solved.c. <T3>Project Design (Work Program)</T3>. The application must contain adetailed and specific work program that is both sound and feasible. Itmust set forth realistic quarterly time targets by which the various worktasks will be completed. (Because quarterly time schedules are used byOCS as a key instrument to monitor progress, failure to include these timetargets may seriously reduce an applicant's point score in this criterion.)It must identify critical issues or potential problems that might impactnegatively on the project and it must indicate how the project objectiveswill be attained notwithstanding any such potential problems.Projects funded under this announcement must produce permanent and measurableresults that will reduce the incidence of poverty in the areas targeted.The OCS grant funds, in combination with private and/or other public resources,must be targeted into low-income communities, distressed communities, and/ordesignated enterprise zones. Projects must be designed to achieve the specificprogram priority area objectives defined in this Program Announcement.If an applicant is proposing a project which will affect a property listedin or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Placesit must identify this property in the narrative and explain how it hascomplied with the provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic PreservationAct of 1966 as amended. If there is any question as to whether the propertyis listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of HistoricPlaces, applicant should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer.(See Attachment E, item 12 for additional guidance.) The applicant shouldcontact OCS early in the development of its application to OCS for instructionsregarding compliance with the Act and data required to be submitted tothe Department of Health and Human Services. Failure to comply with thecited Act may result in the application being ineligible for considerationfor funding.The following are specific items to be addressed for each of the priorityareas:Priority Area 1.0: Urban and Rural Community Economic DevelopmentFollowing are examples of specific impact measures for this priority area:The number of new permanent direct jobs or ownership opportunities to becreated for low-income residents, especially those individuals being servedby public assistance programs of the area that the project is intendedto serve; the number of such jobs maintained; increase in taxes paid; newtechnical skills development and associated career opportunities for low-incomecommunity residents; development of the community's economic and physicalassets; the amount of non-Discretionary Program dollars to be mobilizedand the degree of involvement by private sector individuals, corporations,and foundations in the implementation of the project.Each application submitted under Priority Area 1.0 also must include acomplete Business Plan as part of its project work plan where such a BusinessPlan is appropriate to the project/venture. An application that does notinclude a Business Plan where one is appropriate may be found to be non-responsiveand the application may be disqualified and returned to the applicant.The Business Plan is one of the major components that will be evaluatedby OCS to determine the feasibility of an economic development project.Therefore, the Business Plan must be well prepared and address all themajor issues noted herein.The following guidelines show the necessary sections of a Business Plan,and what should be included in each section.Use of these guidelines should result in a complete and professional BusinessPlan of not more than 20 pages which makes an orderly presentation of thefacts necessary to be judged responsive to the program announcement.Because the guidelines were written to cover a variety of possibilities,rigid adherence to them is not possible nor even desirable for all projects.For example, a plan for a service business would not require a discussionof manufacturing nor product design.<T3>Summary Business Plan:</T3> A 1-2 page summary of the Business Planshould be a brief and accurate presentation of the highlights of the projectand its opportunities and should include the following:andbullet; <T3>The Project:</T3> Indicate when the company was founded, what is specialor unique about it and what it intends to accomplish in this project forwhich funds are being requested.
