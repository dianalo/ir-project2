He has ridden more than 2,900 winnersin his career and rode Great Communicator to victory in the $2 millionBreeder's Cup Turf race at Churchill Downs in 1988.;    But at the prestigiousSouthern California tracks, he was competing against many of the finestjockeys in the country. He said he held his own in that environment for thefirst eight years, but then stopped winning. He won only 43 of 669 starts in1990.;    &quot;I wish I knew what happened,&quot; Sibille said. &quot;Everything was goingwell, but then I fell into a rut.&quot;;    And as victories became scarce,Sibille's confidence diminished.;    &quot;I started to just go through themotions,&quot; he said. &quot;I wasn't having any fun.&quot;;     Sibille has moved toRichmond and says the change of scenery already has been beneficial. Hearrived in the area in time to compete in the final few days of the recentlyconcluded meeting at Bay Meadows in San Mateo, where he rode six winners in 46starts.;    Trainer Jim Hilling, for whom Sibille rode three winners at BayMeadows, said Sibille should not be blamed for the loss of interest.;    &quot;Whenyou're not successful at whatever it is you're doing, getting up in themorning is no fun,&quot; Hilling said.;    But Hilling also said Sibille wasn'twinning in Southern California simply because he wasn't riding the besthorses.;    &quot;I think his skills have been wasted the last couple of years,&quot;Hilling said. &quot;Let's face it, he was up against some of the best jockeys inthe world and they were going to get all the best horses. But he is anexperienced and capable rider. He has worked hard for us and we've been quitepleased with him.&quot;;    Although this will be his first full season in thearea, Sibille is no stranger to the Northern California tracks. He won the1988 Golden Gate Handicap aboard Great Communicator.;    &quot;I've always donewell here,&quot; Sibille said. &quot;It seemed like the perfect place to start over.&quot;;   If everything clicks, Sibille's presence at the 110-day Golden Gate Fieldsmeeting could present a new challenge for defending jockey champion RonHansen, who has won three consecutive riding titles at Bay Meadows and isseeking his second consecutive championship at GGF. Both jockeys are expectedto surpass the 3,000-mark in career victories during the meeting, but Sibillesaid he isn't aiming at a track championship.;    &quot;That's something I don'teven want to think about,&quot; he said. &quot;All I want to do is work hard and do thebest job I can.&quot;;  ETC.: Attendance and mutuel handle at the GGF opener wereup from last year's figures. The crowd at GGF was 9,172 (a 21 percent increaseover last year's 7,579), and attendance at satellite wagering facilitiesbrought the total to 15,885 (a 36 percent increase over last year's 11,668).The overall handle was $2,414,472, marking a 29.8 percent increase over lastyear.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MIKE WEAVER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Albany  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910125  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  598  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday January 25, 199100025225,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
