The issue moved into the spotlight last month when theopposition Democratic Progressive Party adopted a draftconstitution calling for creation of an independent Republicof Taiwan. The government then fueled the debate by arrestingon sedition charges two leaders of a U.S.-basedpro-independence organization who had entered Taiwanillegally.</LP><TEXT>   And a few weeks ago, more than 10,000 demonstratorsmarched through Taipei for two days calling for Taiwan toseek readmission to the United Nations, a demand that manydemonstrators acknowledged was a call for independence.   Independence is supported by only a small portion ofTaiwan's population, and it is unthinkable that the currentgovernment would move in that direction. But the suddeninterest in the issue represents an important opening salvoin the campaign for December's elections for a new NationalAssembly that will decide the future shape of Taiwan'spolitical system.   The opposition is now trying to gauge how attractive apro-independence platform would be to voters. Meanwhile, theruling Kuomintang, or KMT, is projecting itself as theresponsible guardian of a Taiwan whose future is built on apolicy of reunification with the mainland.   The debate over &quot;taidu&quot;, as Taiwan independence isreferred to in Chinese, also is significant simply because itis taking place. The government continues to crack down onwhat it says are seditious activities, but it seems preparedto accept the once-taboo discussion of independence as a factof life.   &quot;As the Republic of China is a democratic country, and ithas a very pluralistic society, the government of coursetakes a rather tolerant attitude toward expressions ofdifferent political opinions,&quot; says government spokesman ShawYu-ming. &quot;Even oral support of Taiwan independence can beprosecuted, but the government chooses not to deal with it.&quot;   But across the Formosa Strait, talk of independenceappears to be unsettling. Beijing repeatedly has warned thatany Taipei move toward independence would be cause formilitary action. And on the eve of the recent demonstrations,the People's Daily printed a harsh editorial saying thatTaiwan independence would constitute a &quot;rape of the people'swill.&quot;   Some military analysts suggest that China could indeed useforce to prevent Taiwan from declaring formal independence.But they say military action would be difficult and costlyagainst Taiwan's formidable coastal defense of missiles, jetfighters and electronic spotting devices.   Other observers say China could head off a Taiwanindependence movement even without force, by throwing theisland's economy into chaos with hard-line rhetoric and bythreatening foreign multinationals that they stand to loseChina's business if they deal with Taiwan.   Yet China itself is vulnerable. With state industriesbleeding red ink, China's economy has become dependent onforeign trade and investment, and Taiwan businessmen andtourists have provided a needed boost since the Tiananmenmassacre in June 1989. With the collapse of Soviet communism,China can ill afford to further offend the world community.   Still, with the Chinese threat in mind, a majority ofTaiwan's people have declared in polls that they much preferthe proven stability ensured by the island's ambiguous statusto the dangers of any rash actions. (The polls also show thatsupport for taidu usually increases in periods when relationsbetween Taiwan and mainland China are less rancorous.)   At the same time, the issue of taidu strikes at the coreof every Taiwan citizen's sense of identity. Among nativeTaiwanese, there is a tangible bitterness toward the manymainland Chinese who fled to the island in the late 1940s,when the KMT was ejected by the communists. For some people,those feelings are heightened by memories of a bloodymassacre of the island's natives by KMT soldiers in 1947.   In recent years, Taiwan has witnessed a resurgence of theuse of the Taiwanese dialect in politics, media, the arts andeveryday life. Moreover, many people on the island -- of bothTaiwanese and mainland origin -- express a desire for theisland's achievements to be recognized on their own merit bythe world. Thus the calls for Taiwan to seek U.N. membershiphave struck a popular chord.   Although President Chiang Ching-kuo, who died in 1988, andthe current president, Lee Teng-hui, who is of Taiwaneseorigin, have overseen democratic reforms that aretransforming Taiwan politics, tension remains. Many Taiwanesestill express resentment that officials of mainland originretain considerable power in the KMT's ruling circles.   During the recent demonstrations, protesters criticizedwhat they see as the government's failure to give voice tothe Taiwanese people. &quot;Taiwan's future must be decided byTaiwan's 20 million people, not by the KMT,&quot; said TingFeng-tien, a 50-year-old retired schoolteacher.   But the demonstrations also revealed a side of the taidumovement that worries many in Taiwan. Organizers briefly lostcontrol of the crowd as it confronted police barricades indowntown Taipei. At one point, radical pro-independencegroups pelted opposition leaders with bottles as they triedto calm the crowd.   Yung Wei, a former high-level government official who nowheads a private political foundation, says of the taidumovement's activities: &quot;I can understand they have somefeelings of having suffered in the past, of having beensuppressed. . . . But I worry about a mass movement. I worryit can get out of control.&quot;   Some analysts suggest that the Democratic ProgressiveParty may be playing on such fears to pressure the governmentinto making concessions. For example, the opposition isdemanding that the government eliminate its sedition law, andofficials already are signaling that they are prepared togive ground.   ---   James McGregor in Beijing contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
