The action follows the company's decision to end talkswith the group, Tiger Management Corp. of New York, on boardnominees and the company's strategic plans. Tiger controlsjust under 10% of the company's stock.</LP><TEXT>   M. Thomas Moore, chairman and chief executive officer,said the group's agenda is &quot;contrary to the best interests ofthe company&quot; and other holders.   Cleveland-Cliffs also said an increase in the quarterlydividend will be recommended to the board at its May meeting.The company has been paying a quarterly dividend of 20 centsa share. A company spokesman said the amount of the increaseddividend hasn't been determined.   Last week, the company said it had reached a preliminaryagreement with Tiger to expand its board to 15 members from12, including five new directors acceptable to both thecompany and the group. That would have meant that at leasttwo current directors would have lost their seats.   But the agreement was apparently scuttled when the boardobjected to the preliminary accord. In particular, the boarddisagreed with the group's demand that less money be investedin iron ore mines in favor of major stock repurchases.   A spokesman for Tiger Management said the company knew thegroup's views before announcing its agreement to expand theboard. &quot;Our views have been consistent and Tiger remainswilling to honor its original agreement,&quot; the spokesman said.The group is considering what actions it should take, butsaid the company's actions could prompt a proxy contest.   The iron ore mining company said it has rescheduled itsannual meeting of shareholders to May 7 from April 9 to givethe group time to consider its options and to giveshareholders time to evaluate the issues, if a proxy battletakes place.</TEXT></DOC>
