Squibb said the Food and Drug Administration's approval greatly broadens the potential use of the drug, generically known as captopril. Previously, Capoten was approved for use with digitalis and diuretics in relieving symptoms of congestive heart failure.    The FDA now has allowed physicians to prescribe Capoten and diuretics without digitalis in cases where patients have poor tolerance for digitalis. Unless dosages are carefully controlled, digitalis can have adverse side effects. </TEXT></DOC>
