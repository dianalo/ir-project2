Most laptop machines sensibly forgo key click, but manyhave a hollow, plastic-on-plastic sound when the key bottoms out at the endof its stroke, and that sound is like a herd of Lilliputian horses whenyou're typing at full speed.andP;  Bad news.andP;  Not only does the wok-wok sounddrive you and everyone within earshot crazy, but it usually means that yourfingers come in for a hard landing, a sure source of fatigue.andM;ASSORTED WEIRDNESSandM;The keyboard has had its share of quixotic saviors.andP;  No one who has ever seenone could forget the Maltron keyboard.andP;  This Dali-esque concoction looked asif it had been left out in the sun too long: Left- and right-hand keys wereclustered in distinct groups, while each key was positioned to normalize thetravel of each finger based on its length and mobility range.andP;  It made sensefrom an ergonomic perspective, but it looked too weird for words.andP;  Itviolated our rectilinear sense of order.andM;We've also seen a number of one-handed typing solutions, including someglovelike contraptions that sensed small movements of your fingertips.andP;  Theywere fast but required special training.andP;  Of course, there are drawbacks tohaving a hand stuck in one of these things.andP;  You get a sudden itch on yournose and the next thing you know you have a black eye.andM;These reinventors of the keyboard were certainly well-intentioned, and wesurely haven't seen the end of them.andP;  But what the keyboard needs is someincremental fixes, not far-out doohickeys.andM;A PRESCRIPTION FOR PERFECTIONandM;Silent operation.andP;  I've tried it both ways and I'm convinced: Key click ishistory.andP;  Given the near-silent operation of many modern PCs, it's absurdthat the single noisiest component of these machines is the keyboard.andM;Over-center breakaway.andP;  If you're going to take away aural feedback, you musthave tactile feedback.andP;  The old plunger switch tells your fingers nothingabout what they're doing, yet its use persists.andM;Less travel.andP;  The difference in travel between my desktop keyboard and mylaptop keyboard is only 80 thousandths of an inch.andP;  But that's 480 inches oftravel saved just in writing this column on my laptop.andM;Less force.andP;  The mere half-ounce difference in effort required to depress akey between desktop and notebook keyboards saved me 93 pounds of effort over40 feet of keystroking.andM;You may take your keyboard for granted, but in the interest of progress,start wishing that your desktop was more like your laptop rather than theother way around.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
