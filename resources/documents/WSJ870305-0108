Then he laughs and adds: &quot;There's another reason. Taxes.&quot;    Or, more precisely, no taxes. Mr. d'Apuzzo is one of the latest arrivals to southern Africa's first tax haven, or, as the brochures say, &quot;Africa's own Switzerland.&quot; To him, it doesn't matter that Ciskei has nothing in common with Switzerland except cows. Nor does it matter that Ciskei is a stepchild of apartheid, a &quot;country&quot; whose independence is recognized only by South Africa. And what's it to him that the place is ruled by an erratic strongman who jailed his own brother and then threatened war on the rival homeland that set the brother free?    What matters is that Mr. d'Apuzzo's company, CHEM Ciskei Ltd., doesn't pay any corporate tax. And that Mr. d'Apuzzo himself pays only a straight 15% tax on his personal earnings, with the first $4,000 exempt. &quot;We got an offer we couldn't refuse,&quot; he says. &quot;We closed everything in Italy and came here. We love the country.&quot;    And it loves him, for Mr. d'Apuzzo and the dozens of other industrialists here are Ciskei's only hope of easing its stifling poverty. They also add a touch of legitimacy to a government so prone to zany statesmanship it has been dubbed the &quot;Keistone Cops.&quot;    The largest contingent of investors here are South Africans, followed by Taiwanese and then Israelis. There is only a handful of European companies; a couple of Americans have already come and gone.    In fact, if it weren't for the tax holiday and other concessions, few investors would touch Ciskei with a 10-foot pole. First off, it is a puppet of the South African government, itself an international pariah. Ciskei was created according to Pretoria's strategy of grand apartheid, which identified the country's blacks by tribe and then sought to segregate them in separate homelands. These homelands would then be written off as independent countries, leaving South Africa essentially for whites.    In the 1970s, Ciskei and neighboring Transkei became dumping grounds for 5.5 million Xhosas. Transkei declared its &quot;independence&quot; from South Africa in 1976; Ciskei followed five years later.    This spawned worry No. 2 for investors. Since independence, the two Xhosa homelands have feuded over which is the rightful tribal home. The bickering escalated late last year when raiders, thought to be from Transkei, attacked a Ciskei jail and freed Charles Sebe, the brother of Ciskei President Lennox Sebe. Lennox had jailed Charles several years earlier for allegedly plotting a coup. After the jailbreak, President Sebe promised a &quot;fight to the last man,&quot; and ordered all Transkeians out of Ciskei. Two weeks ago, other raiders from Transkei attempted to assassinate the Ciskei president.    None of this makes for a particularly good business climate. &quot;The developments of late have the effect of destabilizing this area and making the potential investor lose confidence,&quot; says Cecil Vanda, head of the Ciskei Peoples Development Bank.    Says the manager of a South African factory that opened a year ago in Ciskei: &quot;If we had to do it all over again, I'd have a hard time justifying coming here.&quot;    Given this situation, Ciskei would have to pay investors to come here. Which is precisely what it does.    Ciskei was declared an industrial development point within South Africa several years ago, and began offering all the corporate concessions it could. These included rent and interest subsidies, transportation and electricity rebates, special tender preferences and relocation compensation. The most generous of all was the wage concession, the equivalent of $50 a month paid to companies for each employee hired.    It didn't take much to figure out that by paying workers less than $50 a month (there isn't any minimum wage in Ciskei), investors could make money just by employing people. This prospect attracted Taiwanese industrialists looking for a place with cheaper labor than at home, and a host of South African companies seeking to escape the increasing labor union presence among black workers (Ciskei also doesn't have unions).    As with most things in Ciskei, things suddenly started going wrong. A number of the new companies were exposed as shams; one factory employed 100 gardeners, paying each of them less than $24 a month. &quot;There were so many of them, they were falling over each other in the garden,&quot; says a Peoples Bank official.    Nevertheless, as far as Ciskei was concerned, jobs are jobs, and the factories, no matter how shady, were creating them.    But it turned out that the concessions were costing the government about $10,000 per job per year. Given Ciskei's development ambitions, this would have eventually cost nearly $200 million a year, half of which would have been picked up by the South African government. &quot;It was like pouring money into a bottomless pit,&quot; says Fred Barry, who investigates new proposals for the Peoples Bank.    So Ciskei decided to begin phasing out the concessions and turn itself into a tax haven. With a bit of Reaganomics, the Ciskei government figured the tax holiday wouldn't cost anything up front, and would put so much money in the hands of consumers that the tax revenues would actually rise through personal income taxes and sales taxes. It seems to have worked; last year the government collected more taxes than ever before.    Presently, more than 140 factories dot the hilly Ciskei landscape, producing a variety of products, from toilet seats to wheelchairs. They employ 23,000 people -- a drop in the bucket given Ciskei's one million population, but still 23,000 more jobs than five years ago.    &quot;This is like Taiwan 30 or 40 years ago,&quot; says Paul Ou (pronounced owe), who in 1982 traded in his frozen-pork business in Taiwan for a clothing factory in Ciskei. &quot;No competition, cheap labor.&quot;    At his factory in Dimbaza, Ciskei's biggest industrial center, 400 workers, mostly women, toil over sewing machines nine hours a day to earn an average of $87 a month. The cost to Mr. Ou, who still receives the wage concessions, is about $34 a month, which gives him an edge over clothing makers in Taiwan, who, he figures, pay an average monthly wage of $180.    But what about the troubles in Ciskei? &quot;We leave Taiwan because the men in China threaten us all the time,&quot; he says. &quot;Here, I fear nothing. We are foreigners. They don't shoot foreigners.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
