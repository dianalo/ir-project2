The official Tass news agency reported that the upper stage ofthe Proton rocket booster failed on Wednesday and that on Thursday``the Sputniks entered dense layers of the atmosphere and ceasedtheir existence.''   According to U.S. Space Command, the largest chunk of debrisfrom the mission re-entered the earth's atmosphere Friday afternoonbetween Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and a smaller chunk fell earliernear Australia.   Besides the failure of the Proton, with three satellites aboard,the Soviets lost another satellite, Cosmos 1,906, on Jan. 31. Theimaging satellite was launched on Dec. 26 and was ``blown up toprevent the film and equipment from falling into the hands ofwestern intelligence agencies,'' Oberg said.   Since Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in March1985, Oberg said, the Soviets ``have certainly released newmaterial. But there remain severe limits. Military stuff is clearlybeyond the limit.''   Still, Oberg said, Western technology can detect such events asthe Proton failure, and Western news reports can force furtherdisclosures from the Soviets.   Penetrating the secretive Soviet space program is nothing newfor Oberg, who has published his findings in a new book called``Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost.''   Long before Gorbachev's moderate reforms led to greaterdisclosure of problems in the Soviet Union, Oberg had piecedtogether hair-raising tales of disasters that for decades wentunreported in the state-controlled media.   Oberg has ``been working since childhood at this, watching theirspace program, looking for chinks in their secrecy, and drivingthrough them.''   Soviet secrecy can be dangerous, Oberg wrote in his book. OnOct. 24, 1962, a Soviet space probe exploded into dozens of objectsduring the Cuban missile crisis, the confrontation that brought thesuperpowers their closest to nuclear war.   Debris from the probe ``appeared without warning on Americanattack-warning radars in Alaska,'' Oberg wrote. ``The Cuban missilecrisis was at its height, and for a few moments the unannounced andunpredicted Soviet space failure looked like the long-fearedmassive Soviet (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) attack.''   The debris burned up as it entered the atmosphere. But, Obergsaid, the Soviets have never publicly acknowledged the event.   Soviet media also have not reported on the most spectacular``and probably the greatest disaster of the space age,'' the``Nedelin catastrophe,'' which on about Oct. 24, 1960, killedscores of Soviets including Marshal Mitrofan Nedelin, the commanderin chief of the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces.   The accident came three years after the Soviets launched thefirst satellite, ``Sputnik.'' Operating in the strictest secrecy,the Soviets launched two unmanned spacecraft on a probe to Mars,but both fell back into the atmosphere and burned up because theirupper stages failed.   A third booster was loaded with fuel, and the order was given tolaunch. But the main rocket engine did not ignite. ``It just stoodthere on the launch pad, bathed in searchlights and fuming withclouds of supercold liquid oxygen,'' Oberg wrote.   ``Nedelin made a fatal error and committed a gross violation ofelementary rocket safety standards,'' Oberg wrote. ``From thelaunch bunker, where he had prepared to watch the expected success,he ordered a team of engineers to inspect the rocket boosterimmediately. ...''   ``Since he was an experienced combat commander, he would notsend men into peril he himself avoided, so he walked out to thebase of the rocket while the inspection was being made.''   Although the main rocket failed to ignite, the uppermost stagecontinued to operate as though it were en route to Mars, and at thetime when it would have separated from the booster, fired its ownrockets.   ``A million pounds of kerosene and liquid oxygen flared up in apyre which must have been visible for hundreds of miles,'' Obergwrote.   The Soviet press carried an official obituary of Nedelin severaldays later, saying that he had ``died tragically in the line ofduty'' in a plane crash.   Not a word has appeared since then in the official press,although writings smuggled out of Russia or published by emgreshave described the incident, and Oberg pieced together the evidence.</TEXT></DOC>
