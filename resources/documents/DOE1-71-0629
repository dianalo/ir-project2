The Raman spectrum, observed by excitationin resonance with this absorption, exhibits eight prominent bands whichare assigned to planar phenyl vibrations. The pKsub(a) for the protonloss from the radical cation is 10.87, four units higher than for theaniline radical cation. At high pH the observed transient has a broadand structureless absorption at {similar_to} 380 nm. It is identifiedfrom its resonance Raman features as the 4'(4'aminophenyl)anilino radicalformed by proton loss from the radical cation. The interring CC bondis characterized by a Raman band at 1292 cm/sup -1/, indicating it tobe a single bond. The structure of this neutral radical is highly nonplanar,with little conjugation between the two ring systems so that electronicexcitation is primarily confined to the anilino moiety. The acidic andbasic forms of the radical react rapidly in second order processes toproduce products which absorb strongly at, respectively, 360 and 410nm.</TEXT></DOC>
