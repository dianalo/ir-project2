(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A gun-owners group that led an unsuccessfulattempt to repeal Maryland's handgun control law last year isthreatening to boycott businesses that supported the statute.   A letter was mailed recently to more than 200 businesses on thestationery of the Maryland State Rifle and Pistol Association. Itwas signed by Fred Griisser, a leader of the 1988 campaign against alaw that bans cheap handguns.   ``We're going to give the people a chance to explain themselvesbefore we declare a boycott,'' said Robert McMurray, membershipchairman of the gun group. ``We are going to declare a boycottagainst those who don't respond.''   The association already has withdrawn its funds from Signet Bankin retaliation for a contribution the bank made to gun controlbackers, he said.   Jack Schwartz, an assistant state attorney general, said helearned of the letter Wednesday from a printing company thatreceived a copy.   ``It's deeply offensive and it's just not the way our systemoperates,'' Schwartz said. ``What's so troubling is the election isover. The voters made their decision, and now there appears to be aneffort of economic retaliation to those who participated.''   McMurray said 225 to 250 businesses that made contributions tothe Citizens Against Saturday Night Specials were sent letters.   The letters say an explanation of why businesses supported thelaw would be helpful for consumers to ``make a more informeddecision when selecting products and services.''   They also note that the Maryland State Rifle and PistolAssociation ``represents the interests of the more than 650,000Maryland voters who thought this (the handgun control law) a bad anddangerous law.''   Last November's ballot measure to repeal the law lost by a 58percent to 42 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
