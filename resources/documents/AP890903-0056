Workers in this country are 36 times more likely to be killedthan a Swede, and nine times more likely to be killed than a Briton,the National Safe Workplace Institute found in its annual Labor Dayreport.   In addition, a U.S. worker is more likely to be seriously injuredon the job than a two-pack-a-day cigarette smoker is to contractcancer, according to the report.   ``The evidence indicates that the United States is slipping inits efforts to reduce job injuries,'' Joseph A. Kinney, the group'sexecutive director, said in the report issued Saturday.   The Chicago-based institute is a independent, non-profitgovernment watchdog group devoted to job safety issues.   More muscle and money are needed from the government and theprivate sector ``before it can be concluded that Americans are onthe road to safer work,'' according to the report.   But it noted that some encouraging signs from the Department ofLabor and Occupational Safety and Health Administration indicatepolicy may be shifting in the worker's favor.   According to the group's report:   _More than 10,000 men and women die each year from on-the-jobinjuries.   _Another 70,000 workers become permanently disabled each year asa result of job-related conditions.   _One out of 11 workers will be killed or seriously injured atwork.   The problem is increasing, despite factors such as an aging _ andtheoretically more experienced _ workforce and new technology thatshould reduce or eliminate risk of injury, the institute said.   Bureau of Labor statistics show that in 1987, 8.3 U.S. workersper 100 fulltime employees were injured on the job, up from 7.6 in1983.   In 1986, the nation had 10,700 occupational fatalities. Thefigure would have been just 300 if the United State's fatality ratewere equal to Sweden's, and 6,838 if it were equal to Japan's, thereport said.   But it said, there are ``signs of promise.''   They include Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole's pledge to makeoccupational safety and health a high priority, and recent action byOSHA, the report said.   For example, the group noted that on July 27, OSHA imposed a$2.72 million fine and sought a court injunction against FrictionDivision Products, Inc. of Trenton, N.J., for alleged failure toprotect workers from asbestos exposure.   The company was accused of violating ``almost every provision ofOSHA's asbestos standard in the process of threatening the healthand even the lives of many of its workers,'' the report said.   The report also cited a $2 million proposed penalty Mrs. Doleissued July 7 against Ford Motor Co. ``for failing to live up to itsNovember 1987 agreement with the Department of Labor to accuratelyrecord injuries and illnesses.''   `While the final chapter of Dole's leadership is far fromwritten, the opening pages provide America's workers with the mostencouraging signs of safe work that they have had in severalyears,'' the report concludes.</TEXT></DOC>
