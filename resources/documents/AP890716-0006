(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wildcat strikes waned in the southernAppalachian and Midwestern coal fields Saturday as aunion-sanctioned work stoppage expired, but some coal officialsworried that a union back-to-work order wasn't genuine.   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka on Friday called anend to a five-day non-paid holiday and asked 37,000 union coalminers to end wildcat strikes that have idled much of the nation'scoal production since June 12.   Miners in Alabama, Illinois and Indiana immediately heeded thecall and some returned for light work in the coal fields Saturday.Most aren't scheduled to return to work until Monday.   Illinois had 8,500 miners returning, Alabama had 5,000 andIndiana 1,750.   Officials of the largest UMW district in Pennsylvania on Saturdayasked 3,500 striking members to return to work at 12:01 a.m. Monday,said District 2 president Nick Molnar, who met with most of the 54union local presidents at the district's headquarters in Edensburg.   Some of the strikers in Kentucky have agreed to go back to workand the remainder are undecided. It wasn't certain on Saturday howmany of the remaining wildcatters in West Virginia, Ohio andTennesee would go back to work. Meetings were scheduled in thosestates through the weekend.   The wildcat strikes began June 12 in support of 1,900 miners inWest Virigina, Virginia and Kentucky on strike against theVirginia-based Pittston Coal Group Inc. The strike against Pittstonbegan April 5 in a contract dispute.   Pittston wants a contract separate from the national pact so itcan require Sunday work and mandatory overtime and cut medicalbenefits for pensioners from 100 percent to 80 percent.   At a rally Saturday attended by about 400 miners in Colcord, 40miles south of Charleston, some members said they didn't want to goback to work.   ``If we stop now without accomplishing anything, we might as wellsay `Here's our jobs, take 'em,''' said miner Joe James.   In Madison, about 25 miles south of Charleston, UMW District 17officials met Saturday with more than 400 local presidents andmembers but were unable to persuade everyone to cease the wildcatstrikes. A federal judge has ordered the union to put an end towildcat strike activities.   ``It was about 50-50, but some of them met again after they leftour place,'' said a union official speaking on a condition ofanonymity. ``Some will start back, and as they see how things aregoing, others might go back.''   The indecision fueled speculation by coal industry officials thatTrumka's plea for an end to the wildcat strike wasn't sincere.   ``I think the whole situation is very suspect as to whether theirtrue intention is to return to work,'' said Mark Polen, a spokesmanfor the West Virginia Coal Association, whose members have lost15,000 workers to the strike.   Polen said he suspected Trumka's call was not genuine because itincluded a continued unpaid holiday in some places for no apparentreason.   The union did not say why it extended the holiday period inplaces, but in the past some districts have been kept out longer inattempts to even out the amount of time that workers were out. Thisyear, District 17 workers in southern West Virginia started thewildcat strikes but those in northern West Virginia's District 31didn't leave until the third day.   ``Only time and the Sunday midnight shift will tell,'' Polen said.   A spokesman for the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, whichincludes most major coal companies except for Pittston and holds ano-strike contract with the union, said he wouldn't comment at leastuntil Monday.   The union's international executive board meets July 26 andTrumka's back-to-work request said the miners should return to thecoal mines at least until then.   The union's contract allows it to call 10 holidays, or ``memorialdays,'' a year. The union used five last week in what was to havebeen a cooling-off period, but sporadic violence still disrupted thecoal fields.   The miners apparently were encouraged that a federal judge inVirginia invited both Trumka and Pittston President Paul Douglas tomeet with him Tuesday to discuss why negotiators reached an impassein early June.   Trumka accepted Judge Glen Williams' offer. Pittston Coal GroupPresident Michael Odom said the company would have no comment.</TEXT></DOC>
