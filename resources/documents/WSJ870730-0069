DiGennaro, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Suffield Financial Corp., resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of possible insider trading.    Suffield Financial, based in Suffield, Conn., said Mr. DiGennaro acknowledged that he was being investigated for possible insider trading in connection with the bank holding company's $40-a-share acquisition of Coastal Bancorp of Portland, Maine, last year. It added that he was leaving &quot;to devote himself to defense of this matter.&quot;    Robert Bennett, Mr. DiGennaro's attorney, said, &quot;My client adamantly denies any wrongdoing and intends to contest the matter if he has to.&quot; The SEC wouldn't comment.    Coastal disclosed July 9, 1986, that it had received an offer from Suffield to acquire the Maine bank for $40 a share in Suffield common stock, or about $5.2 million. Before the disclosure, Coastal shares had been trading between $29 and $30.25, but afterward they rose to $34.25. Suffield completed the acquisition earlier this year.    Russell S. Douglas, a retired Maine banker, last month was charged by the SEC with buying Coastal shares after receiving a tip in October 1985 that Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar Bancorp Inc. was planning a bid for Coastal. The bid was made, but was unsuccessful. Mr. Douglas, without admitting or denying guilt, agreed to repay $9,500 in profits and to pay an additional $9,500 fine. It wasn't immediately clear if that case is related to the investigation of Mr. DiGennaro.    Mr. DiGennaro, a 40-year-old attorney, joined Suffield in 1971. He was named president and treasurer in 1982, chief executive later that year and chairman in 1985.    Suffield said James H. Whittaker, vice president and chief financial officer of the parent corporation, will assume Mr. DiGennaro's responsibilities as president and chief executive. Sumner F. Bissell, chairman of the executive committee of the company's Suffield Bank, will be chairman of the boards of the parent and the bank. Earlier this month, the company said the bank's president, John R. DiBella, was terminated because of &quot;certain philosophical differences&quot; with the board.    Suffield said the insider-trading investigation doesn't involve the parent or the bank. Suffield Financial stock closed at $12.50, down $1.50, in over-the-counter trading yesterday.    News of the investigation surprised analysts, though they said that lately the New England stock market was buzzing with rumors of a trading scandal involving the companies.    &quot;There has been talk for the past six to eight weeks, but I dismissed (it),&quot; said James Moynihan of Moseley Securities in Boston.    Suffield has assets of about $563 million. In addition to Coastal Savings Bank and Suffield Bank, it has three real estate companies. </TEXT></DOC>
