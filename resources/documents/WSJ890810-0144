The &quot;index of consumer attitude,&quot; taken from a survey of 5,040 households on June 15, fell to 44.8 from 47.3 last December. The agency didn't say what member of each household was interviewed.    A large part of the decline came from the indexed response to the question, &quot;Do you think the rate of price increase is faster compared with a year earlier?&quot; This index plunged to 22.3 from 35.0 in the last survey, taken before the consumption tax was introduced. Identical characterizations of the pace by all respondents would produce an index of 100. </TEXT></DOC>
