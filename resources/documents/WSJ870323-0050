McIvor, an Exxon senior vice president, said that the world is consuming about twice as much petroleum as is being found and that almost all the world's excess oil-producing capacity, estimated at 20%, lies in the Middle East. &quot;Unless huge new discoveries are made -- an unlikely event in my view -- we're going to become increasingly dependent on the large remaining reserves of a few Middle East countries,&quot; he said.    Mr. McIvor's comments were the first definitive declaration that the world's largest oil company expects a significant recovery in oil prices. Responsible for Exxon's world-wide exploration and development activities, Mr. McIvor was to deliver the speech in Queensland, Australia, Monday morning (yesterday at 7:30 p.m. EST) but was unable to because of schedule changes. His comments were delivered instead by Stuart R. McGill, chairman of Esso Australia Ltd., an unit of New York-based Exxon.    As previously reported, Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon's chairman, and Lee R. Raymond, president, said that Exxon's internal planning is based on the price of oil staying relatively flat -- in real terms -- for a few years and then rising faster than the rate of inflation. Though Mr. McIvor wasn't specific on the timing, he did stress in his speech that &quot;it seems inevitable that the price of oil must rise significantly again before too long.&quot;    Mr. McIvor noted that the world has been using oil at rates of 20 billion to 25 billion barrels a year since 1970, while discoveries have been accumulating at only 10 billion to 15 billion barrels a year. &quot;This means that, to a significant degree, we're using up the inventory found prior to 1970 at an increasing rate,&quot; he said.    Although 30,000 oil fields have been discovered in the world to date, Mr. McIvor said, 35% of all the oil ever found is in just 37 fields, and all but 11 of these &quot;super giants&quot; are in the Middle East. Moreover, he said, only five super-giant fields have been found in the past 20 years, and only two of these -- Prudhoe Bay in the U.S. and Cantarell in Mexico -- are outside the Middle East. &quot;As supply and demand come closer together, as they must do at some point, the world's spare capacity is going to be in a very few countries,&quot; he said.    Mr. McIvor stressed that he isn't dismissing continued oil exploration as fruitless. He cited &quot;definite potential&quot; for economic exploration and development of oil outside the Middle East. &quot;Valuable discoveries continue to be made each year in scores of countries around the world,&quot; he said. Nonetheless, he said, &quot;most major consuming countries, including those with substantial production of their own, will ultimately come to depend heavily on Middle East oil.&quot;    Exxon is more sanguine on the outlook for world-wide natural gas supplies. Natural gas &quot;will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the world's energy supply,&quot; Mr. McIvor said. And as oil prices rise, he added, nonconventional sources such as shale oil and the conversion of natural gas and coal to synthetic oil will become important. </TEXT></DOC>
