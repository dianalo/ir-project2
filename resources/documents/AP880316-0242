SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The White House remained silent Wednesday onthe question of whether President Reagan would pardon key figuresindicted by a federal grand jury for their involvement in theIran-Contra affair.   Under the Constitution, a president holds immense power when itcomes to granting pardons. The question now looms whether Reaganwill choose to use it.   On Wednesday, a federal grand jury indicted Reagan's formernational security adviser, John M. Poindexter, along with firedWhite House aide Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and two arms dealers onconspiracy charges in the diversion of Iranian arms sales profitsto the Nicaraguan Contras.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan was informedof the indictments by Kenneth Duberstein, his deputy chief ofstaff. Speaking of Reagan, Fitzwater said, ``He had no response.''He said there was no White House comment because ``it's a matterbefore the courts.''   Since the Iran-Contra scandal erupted in November 1986, Reaganhas refused _ in public at least _ to entertain any discussion ofpardons.   ``This is a subject I have not and will not discuss at thistime,'' Reagan said last November.   Reporters tried _ at least four times that day _ to persuade himto discuss it, but Reagan repeatedly refused to do so.   In the intervening months, Reagan has been careful not to ruleout the option.   He has made it clear _ particularly in his description of Northas an ``American hero'' _ that he is giving the former NationalSecurity Council aide the benefit of the doubt.   ``I'm going to wait until he's had his day in court,'' Reagansaid last summer when queried about North's testimony before thejoint congressional committees investigating the matter. Reaganadded that he was ``not going to pre-judge'' North based on histelevised appearances before the committees.   And after Congress completed its investigation, Reagan said in anational broadcast that he thought North and Poindexter ``believedthey were doing what I would've wanted done.''   Although contending he was as ``mad as a hornet'' about thedamage inflicted on his administration, the president has nevercriticized his aides for lying to Congress, shredding documents orparticipating in a cover-up.   Reagan, questioned at one time about the series of laws in 1985and 1986 barring direct or indirect military aid to the Contras,responded: ``I don't think that the law was broken.''   In fact, if Reagan choses to grant pardons to anyone connectedwith the affair, he would not have to list a specific crime that isbeing pardoned.   Such sweeping power amounts to a legal grant of absolution,enshrined in the Constitution. The Founding Fathers borrowed theconcept from English common law.   It allows a president virtually unlimited authority covering``offenses against the United States, except in cases ofimpeachment.''   ``He's really very free,'' said C. Thomas Dienes, a professor ofconstutional law at George Washington University.   A president is able to grant a pardon involving a federal crimesolely on his own initiative _ he need not consult anyone or evenwait for an indictment or conviction before taking action, Dienessaid.   Dienes cited an 1867 Supreme Court case, Ex Parte Garland, whichstates the effect of such a presidential decision: ``In the eye ofthe law, the offender is as innocent as if he never committed theoffense.''   During his nearly eight years in office, Reagan has granted 333pardons out of 1,894 requests, according to the Justice Department.   Normally, the process begins with a four-page applicationsubmitted to the Justice Department's pardon attorney. Sincevirtually all the applicants have been convicted of crimes, thedepartment's guidelines require that applicants wait five years toseven years after the completion of their sentences.   But presidents are allowed under the Constitution to avoid thatroute.   Two months into his first term, Reagan ignored the formalprocedure and granted pardons to two former FBI officials convictedof sanctioning warrantless break-ins.   That was the path President Ford took to pardon Richard Nixon onSept. 8, 1974, for any wrongdoing connected with the Watergatescandal.   Ford's pre-emptive pardon sent his popularity ratings into atumble. It also contributed to his loss of the 1976 elections.   Although Reagan is barred from running again, his decision inthis case could affect Vice President George Bush's chances in thepresidential election this fall and those of other GOP candidates,according to Stephen Hess, a senior fellow and specialist inpresidential affairs at the Brookings Institution in Washington.   Hess predicted that if Reagan decided to pardon any Iran-Contrafigures, he would wait until after the November elections.   ``Since Ford's action cost him the election, I doubt we'll seeReagan move before November,'' Hess said.   He added: ``I would be stunned if there isn't a pardon betweenelection day and January 1989. As outgoing president, Reagan is inthe best position to take the heat.''</TEXT></DOC>
