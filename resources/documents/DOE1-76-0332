When incorporated in a positionservo system equipped with a DC servo motor, a DSC system serves to rapidlycompensate the parameter variation and output variation due to torquedisturbance and to perform robust control even under transient conditions.A DSC system consists of the following two components: feedforward loopequipped with a disturbance monitor and low-sensitivity compensator underpassive adaptive control. These can be designed independently to havedifferent stiffness characteristics and sensitivity characteristics.The DSC is decoupled from the position control system. For a positionservo system equipped with DSC, therefore, specifications can be setup independently for stiffness, sensitivity and transfer to permit three-degreefreedom control. Field tests demonstrate its high performance for controlof both voltage and current. (12 figs, 1 tab, 11 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
