RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BELTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL)COMPUTERS (EDP)PUBLISHING (PUB) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bell Atlantic Corp. said it will soon appeal a ruling that bars regional phone companies from publishing computerized Yellow Pages, using the same First Amendment argument Bell opponents have voiced in the case.    Addressing securities analysts here, executives of the Philadelphia-based regional Bell holding company also forecast profit growth of 6% to 8% for 1987. And for the first time, the company provided financial details of its non-telephone company operations, all of which are profitable.    Thomas E. Bolger, chairman and chief executive officer, said the company's lawyers are preparing the appeal now, and the company will file it after a further ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene, when he is expected to outline the precise role the Baby Bells can play in the electronic information industry.    Another executive of the Philadelphia-based regional holding company said the date of the filing will be early next year.    Judge Greene oversees compliance with the terms of the Bell system breakup in 1984.    &quot;We will argue that our First Amendment rights are being violated,&quot; Mr. Bolger said in an interview. While the company has no desire to compete against publishers of newspapers and magazines, he said phone companies should be allowed to provide computerized access to the Yellow Pages directory, which he described as a traditional phone-company product. Newspaper publishers have been the primary opponents of electronic publishing by phone companies.    In September, Judge Greene ruled the Baby Bells couldn't provide information, but that they could transmit information supplied by others. He thus retained a ban that was first imposed at the breakup.    Bell Atlantic's First Amendment argument would represent an ironic twist in a protracted struggle between phone companies and newspaper publishers over electronic publishing.    The publishers have said they see a First Amendment threat in electronic publishing by the Bells, fearing the phone companies could use their phone-lines network to choke off transmission of diverse sources of information. Phone companies have charged that the publishers simply fear competition for advertising.    Referring to Bell Atlantic's earnings, Mr. Bolger said the net increase for 1987 is expected to be &quot;solidly in the range of its 6% to 8% objective.&quot; For all of 1986, the company had net of $1.17 billion, or $5.85 a share, on revenue of $9.92 billion.    Mr. Bolger said non-telephone company operations -- called Bell Atlantic Enterprises -- are &quot;playing a key role&quot; in the earnings growth. Those businesses include cellular mobile communications, computer maintenance and equipment leasing; they will account for one-third of the earnings increase, he said.    For all of 1987, the non-telephone businesses are expected to post net of $40 million to $45 million, compared with year-earlier $16 million, said Raymond W. Smith, vice chairman and chief financial officer. Revenue is expected to rise to as much as $875 million from the year-ago $452 million.    James G. Cullen, president and chief executive officer of Bell Atlantic Enterprises, said the cellular operations are expected to post revenue of as much as $90 million this year, compared with $47 million a year ago. He also said those operations, part of a new cellular telephone industry, would be profitable.    The Bell Atlantic Capital Corp. unit, which includes the company's leasing operations, is expected to have revenue of $440 million this year, compared with last year's $121 million. </TEXT></DOC>
