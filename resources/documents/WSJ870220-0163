Cheney's &quot;A Long Celebration to Do Right by the Constitution&quot; (editorial page, Jan. 6), why such a prominent leader of the American Revolution as Patrick Henry opposed the ratification of the Constitution with such unrelenting vigor and passion.    Henry's reputation has suffered greatly as a result of his being the most prominent of the Anti-Federalists. This is unfortunate and unfair because the subsequent success of the Constitution owes much to the opposition mounted by the &quot;losers&quot; of the constitutional debate.    What Henry found objectionable, even dangerous, in the new Constitution was the threat to liberty from a powerful central government far removed from the people. &quot;My great objection is, that it does not leave us the means of defending our rights, or of waging war against tyrants,&quot; said Henry. He was equally alarmed over the granting of unbridled taxing authority to the new government. He knew full well, having waged his first battles against the abuse of the taxing power by Great Britain, that liberty could easily be lost through such abuse. He feared a government that could manipulate the taxing power to further its own ends and not those of the people.    To protect those liberties that Henry saw threatened by a centralized government with immense taxing authority, he became the most vocal and eloquent proponent of amendments to the Constitution that would specifically protect the basic rights of citizens. Madison decided to support amendments only after Henry and his colleagues raised such a furor that ratification appeared doubtful unless amendments were accepted. Henry wanted the amendments to be ratified in conjunction with the larger document. Although the Federalists finally accepted the principle of amendments to the Constitution, these amendments did not become part of the Constitution until 1791, four years after it was ratified. The amendments, of course, are known as the Bill of Rights, and Henry, more than anyone else, was responsible for ensuring that the Bill of Rights became an intregal part of the Constitution. If Madison is often called the Father of the Constitution, Henry rightfully should be called the Father of the Bill of Rights. Madison gave the Constitution its body; Henry provided its soul.    Equally important for American constitutional government was Henry's acceptance of defeat, after such a long and bitter struggle: &quot;If I shall be in the minority, I shall have those painful sensations which arise from a conviction of being overpowered in a good cause. Yet I will be a peaceable citizen. My head, my hand, and my heart shall be at liberty to retrieve the loss of liberty and remove the defects of this system in a constitutional way. I wish not to go to violence. . . . I shall therefore patiently wait in expectation of seeing that government changed, as to be compatible with the safety, liberty, and happiness of the people.&quot; This acceptance of political defeat by the most powerful man in Virginia, the wealthiest state of the new union, was of immense importance. As Mrs. Cheney points out in her article &quot;The peaceful manner in which the new government was launched . . . excited the wonder of the world,&quot; and we could add, set the course of American democracy on the right path. Hopefully, during the bicentennial celebrations, Patrick Henry's pivotal role in ensuring that the Bill of Rights be made part of the Constitution to safeguard liberty will be given the tribute it deserves.
