Becauseof the a posteriori nature of this process and the intercorrelation ofmeteorological predictors in both space and time, standard tests of significancecannot be applied precisely. The problem of how to terminate the selectionof predictors in screening is therefore difficult. In this paper theproblem is studied by expressing anomalies of monthly mean temperatureat 109 surface stations across the United States as a function of theprevious temperature plus concurrent anomalies of mean 700 mb heightat a network of 133 grid points over North America and surrounding oceans.Data are screened to yield several sets of multiple regression equationsby applying various cut-off criteria, such as the F-ratio, additionalexplained variance, and number of variables, to terminate the selectionof additional predictors. Optimum stopping points are determined by testing20 alternate criteria in terms of five verification statistics on twodifferent sets of independent data. 14 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
