In theyear-earlier half, the company had a loss of $526,000, or sixcents a share, on revenue of $154,000.   Mr. Prestayko said in an interview that Medco is turningprofitable because of accelerating sales of Adenocard, a drugused to treat one type of cardiac arrhythmia. Adenocard, usedmainly in hospital emergency rooms to restore the heart'snormal rhythm, is licensed by Medco to a unit of FujisawaPharmaceutical Co. for sale in the U.S. and Canada.   Medco expects to make its first European sales this fallin the United Kingdom. An application was filed in thatcountry last October, Mr. Prestayko said. Medco's Europeanmarketing partner, Sanofi, a French pharmaceutical company,will pay Medco royalties of about 6% of sales after certainexpenses. Medco receives a 12.5% royalty from Fujisawa on netsales in the U.S.   Medco's bigger hopes are tied to its second product,Adenoscan, a drug intended to replace cardiac treadmill testsfor some patients by mimicking increased blood flows to theheart without exercise. Medco estimates that nearly 500,000U.S. patients would be candidates for Adenoscan. Du Pont Co.,the Wilmington, Del., chemical concern whose rival drug hasbeen on the market for a month or two, is charging about $110a dose, Mr. Prestayko said.   He said Food and Drug Administration officials recentlyhave told the company they are &quot;near completion of theirreview&quot; of Adenoscan. Medco's application to market Adenoscanwas filed with the FDA in February 1990.   Medco also is pursuing efforts to obtain a patent onAdenoscan. The initial application, filed with the U.S.Patent Office &quot;at least a couple of years ago,&quot; was rejectedon grounds that it wasn't a new invention, Mr. Prestaykosaid. Medco disagrees and has retained patent attorneys topress forward with the application, he said.   Mr. Prestayko declined to make a forecast of Adenoscansales or profit. &quot;Clearly, when Adenoscan sales start comingin, we will increase our profitability fairly rapidly,&quot; hesaid. Medco will receive a 25% royalty on U.S. Adenoscansales under its agreement with Fujisawa.</TEXT></DOC>
