Fund groups report heavy cash inflows into all types ofmutual funds. But especially notable has been a surge ofmoney into two of the most volatile categories, thesmall-company stock funds and high-yielding junk bond funds.</LP><TEXT>   According to numbers released yesterday by the InvestmentCompany Institute, $666 million poured into stock funds inJanuary, up from $184 million in December. The numbersreflect stock-fund sales minus redemptions, plus the neteffect of switches between stock funds and other funds in thesame fund group. Reinvested dividends are excluded.   Fund groups say that January was a roller-coaster monthfor stock-fund sales. Money poured out of stock funds in thefirst half of January, as investors wagered that a war withIraq would send stock prices tumbling. But ever since Jan.17, when the market rallied 114.6 points on hopes of a quickwar, money has been flooding back into stock funds.   And this month, many fund groups say cash continued topour in, often at a record pace.   &quot;This will be the best February we have ever had,&quot; saysTim Pitts, an executive vice president with New York'sOppenheimer Management Corp. At T. Rowe Price Associates inBaltimore, stock-fund inflows this month are the strongestever.   &quot;I'm flabbergasted looking at our sales numbers,&quot; saysGavin Quill, a marketing research analyst with Scudder,Stevens andamp; Clark. Among Scudder's 27 mutual funds, the onlyfund to see a net outflow during February was one of itsmoney market funds.   Denver's Invesco Funds Group says it has been flooded withphone calls in recent weeks. &quot;I'm not sure how long we cantake it, frankly,&quot; says spokesman Don Clark. &quot;We've gotpeople here working 15-hour days on the phone.&quot;   Among stock-fund categories, international funds andgrowth funds have probably attracted the most money thismonth, fund groups indicate. But on a percentage basis, thebiggest winners have clearly been funds that invest in sharesof smaller companies.   According to Lipper Analytical Services, 72% of thesmall-stock funds had less than $100 million in assets at thestart of this year. As a result, even a relatively smallpickup in cash inflow can mean a huge percentage increase inthe size of one of these funds.   MFS Lifetime Emerging Growth Trust, for instance, hasgrown to $94 million today from $76 million at year end. Inthe same period, Scudder Development Fund rose to $440million from $310 million. That's partly because of a reboundin prices of small stocks, but the funds also have enjoyedheavy cash inflows.   Even T. Rowe Price New Horizons, the fund industry'sbiggest small-stock fund, has ballooned to $1.08 billion inassets today from $855 million at year-end 1990. So far thismonth, the fund has been T. Rowe Price's second-best-sellingstock fund.   According to a survey conducted for Fidelity Investmentsby the University of Michigan Survey Research Center, the biginflows into stock funds are likely to continue. The surveyfound that among mutual fund shareholders, the net intentionto purchase stock-fund shares jumped to 34% this month from24% in January. (This figure equals the percentage of peopleplanning to buy stock-fund shares in the next three months,minus those planning to sell.)   Stock mutual funds haven't run out of buying power. Cashheld by stock funds stood at 11% of assets at the end ofJanuary. That's down from 11.5% in December and 12.9% inOctober -- the highest level ever recorded in the 30 yearsthe Investment Company Institute has been tracking cashlevels. But much of the recent percentage drop has occurredbecause stock prices have risen. In the past three months,the actual amount of cash held by stock-fund managers hasonly fallen slightly, to $28.4 billion from $29.2 billion.   Junk bond funds, which have had net cash outflows in 16 ofthe past 19 months, saw large cash inflows during February,according to fund-company executives.   Fund groups such as Invesco, Franklin Resources,Massachusetts Financial Services, Oppenheimer, T. Rowe Priceand Vanguard all say they had inflows into their high-yieldfunds. Such funds hold debt securities of companies that havelow credit ratings or aren't rated at all. &quot;With interestrates coming down, people may be looking for a higher yield,&quot;suggests Oppenheimer's Mr. Pitts.   At Franklin, the search for higher yields seems to havecaused investors to switch out of the fund group'smoney-market funds, where yields have dropped sharply sincethe start of the year. Part of that money may have ended upin Franklin's long-term municipal bond fund and its U.S.Government Securities fund, which buys Government NationalMortgage Association bonds.   Short-term rates have dropped, points out Gregory Johnson,a marketing vice president. &quot;You've had a lot of money movinginto the longer maturities&quot; as the gap has widened betweenshort-term and long-term yields.</TEXT></DOC>
