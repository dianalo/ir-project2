In 1985, forthe first time since the start of civil nuclear programs, reactor consumptionwill equal uranium production. The spot market is becoming more important.In the first half of 1985 13 million pounds of uranium oxide, 20 percentof all uranium produced in the West, was traded in this way. This comparesto a traditional 10 percent. For long-term contracts base prices havefallen to 25 dollars a pound, with occasional lots being sold on thespot market for as little as 14 dollars and 25 cents. In 1984 Canadabecame the world's largest uranium producer. Producers in Canada haveremained profitable in spite of low prices. Canadian production in 1984was 29.1 million pounds, mainly from Saskatchewan. Weak prices have mademany U.S. mines, which are high cost, low grade operations, unprofitable,and U.S. production could fall to 9 million pounds in 1985. Utilitieshave only 13 percent of the projected 1995 demand protected by long termcontracts, and higher uranium prices look possible.</TEXT></DOC>
