The company said it proposes to issue $500 of new convertible debentures and 35 common shares in exchange for each $1,000 of its $160 million of 12.7% debentures. The bonds resulted from last year's refinancing of the $160 million of debt that the company took on to go private.    The company said it also plans to offer new debentures and stock in exchange for $25 million of notes held by Equitable Life Assurance Society.    Dart Drug said it values its common at about $6.75 a share and plans to seek a listing on the American Stock Exchange.    The exchange offer is subject to acceptance by holders of at least 85% of the $185 million debt outstanding. If it is accepted, the company said, about half its equity would be in public hands. The company currently is owned by its management and employees.    The company, formerly part of Dart Group Corp., said the exchange offer was designed to reduce its interest expense and help it become profitable. In the year ended last July 31, Dart Drug said, it had a loss of $9.7 million because of interest costs.    &quot;The retail market in this area has been very competitive,&quot; Darryl S. Bryant, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said. &quot;We've not had the sales growth that we anticipated when we originally did the leveraged buyout.&quot;    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is to be paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Dart Drug said it filed a registration statement for the exchange offer with the Securities and Exchange Commission but that the statement hasn't yet taken effect. Rothschild Inc. is dealer-manager for the offer, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
