Whateverelse the jurors may have thought during the three-month trialof the woman with all the shoes, they easily concluded thatMrs. Marcos wasn't a racketeer.   The real mystery is how then-U.S. Attorney RudolphGiuliani persuaded the Justice Department that the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations law was appropriate forthis case -- just as he managed to RICO other notorious&quot;gangsters&quot; such as investment bankers.</LP><TEXT>   Marcos juror Thomas O'Rourke, a Transit Authority worker,said Mr. Giuliani was &quot;only trying to make a name forhimself&quot; with this &quot;totally silly case.&quot; Those are remarkablycritical words from a juror. So much for a reported StateDepartment cable that Mr. Giuliani had &quot;guaranteed&quot; aconviction.   The case became more complex when Ferdinand Marcos died inSeptember; none of the case's allegations involved Mrs.Marcos alone. But there were problems with the case as earlyas the indictment two years ago after the Marcoses gave uppower and were given refuge in Hawaii. The case claimed to beabout property in the U.S., but it was obvious to everyonethat the prosecution was brought because of what the Marcosesdid in the Philippines.   The charges were based on alleged stealing of some $200million from the Philippine treasury that the couple thenspent on jewels, art and New York real estate. The defensethat the money was from a gold hoard Mr. Marcos discoveredmay not have been easy to credit. Still, after almost 100prosecution witnesses and thousands of pages of bank records,even the judge wondered what a case that belonged in aPhilippine court was doing in ours. Judge John Keenan askedout of the jury's hearing, &quot;What's an American court, what amI, doing here, trying a case involving the theft of moneyfrom Philippine banks?&quot; The jury apparently agreed.   The collapse of this prosecution is surely a tellingexample of prosecutorial hubris. We knew that with RICO anaggressive prosecutor could indict a ham sandwich, but it nowappears that convictions may no longer be so easy. Comingafter a judge vacated the RICO sentences of Princeton/Newportsecurities officials, this acquittal leaves us wondering howa Michael Milken might have fared with a New York jury ifRICO's power hadn't rubber-hosed him into a settlement. Theembarrassing Marcos acquittal should be another nail inRICO's coffin.   There is also a serious foreign policy point here. Weworried that this case might deter other tyrants from givingup power bloodlessly if they saw that they'd still end upRICO'd into a U.S. jail cell. We doubt that the StateDepartment will be pressured again by U.S. Attorneys who wantto indict foreign heads of state, at least without clearevidence of legal wrongdoing in this country.   This prosecution didn't do the Philippines any favorseither. Whatever Mr. Marcos's venal crimes, the real scandalremains that his reign delayed any mature system of democracyand free markets. Surely the embattled Corazon Aquino hasenough on her mind without having to worry about moreinternal divisions caused by any unintended rehabilitation ofthe Marcoses in a U.S. court.</TEXT></DOC>
