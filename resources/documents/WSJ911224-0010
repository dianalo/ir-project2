U.S. Judge Milton Pollack, in Manhattan, said he has askedthe parties involved &quot;to explore . . . a possible globalsettlement that would dispose of the many claims and actionsthat have been filed against Mr. Milken and other formeremployees of Drexel in courts throughout the country.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Although Judge Pollack said participation in thesettlement efforts would be voluntary, attorneys familiarwith the case said there are incentives for both plaintiffsand defendants to join in the proposed talks. They also saidthat Judge Pollack's determination and clout will bring manyparties to the negotiating table.   &quot;It is certainly in line with what Judge Pollack has beentrying to do from the outset. Otherwise the litigation couldgo on for years,&quot; said one attorney previously involved inthe litigation. &quot;He's really putting the squeeze on. . . .When a judge makes an announcement like this, the pressure ison everyone&quot; to negotiate.   Judge Pollack, a senior U.S. district judge known for hishandling of other complicated securities-related cases, iscredited with pulling off the settlement of Drexel'scontentious bankruptcy case. He is presiding over Drexel'slawsuit against Mr. Milken for breach of fiduciary duty andthrift regulators' suit blaming Mr. Milken and others forsavings-and-loans' losses in junk-bond transactions.   Mr. Milken, who pleaded guilty last year to sixsecurities-related felonies, has begun serving a 10-yearprison sentence. He has denied the allegations of Drexel,thrift regulators and plaintiffs in other civil suits.   Mr. Milken's spokesman and a Drexel spokesman bothdeclined to comment. Attorneys for thrift regulators couldn'tbe reached. Judge Pollack said he has instructed all partiesto the negotiations to make no public comment.   The latest settlement efforts could greatly enhance thepool of money that will be used to pay Drexel creditors. Inaddition to divvying up Drexel's assets, the bankruptcysettlement also provided for collecting hundreds of millionsof dollars in damages from such individuals as Mr. Milken.Without a settlement with Mr. Milken and the other individualdefendants, the Drexel creditors would still have to litigatemany of their claims against the individual defendants.   Judge Pollack, in an interview, said the settlement talkswith individual defendants could be viewed as &quot;a clean up&quot; ofcivil claims related to the Drexel case. He said Drexel'sbankruptcy proceeding &quot;could be utilized to clear away theseclaims.&quot;   Judge Pollack declined to set a schedule for settlementnegotiations, and he said it is too early to estimate thetotal amount that might be paid to settle the claims. But hesaid the parties were under pressure to reach a settlementbefore trials begin in the pending litigation. Drexel's suitagainst Mr. Milken, for instance, is set to go to trial inApril, and thrift regulators are scheduled to go to trial inone case in federal court in California in October.   Judge Pollack said, &quot;The lawyers who have been involvedare optimistic that it's a worthwhile objective to pursue.&quot;In announcing the settlement talks, the judge said,&quot;Preliminary discussions have indicated a substantialpossibility of achieving the objective, although there aremany problems to be overcome.&quot;   The hurdles are daunting: The litigation involves dozensof suits in federal courts around the country over variousalleged fraud schemes. The only thing many of the cases havein common is that the cast of alleged wrongdoers include Mr.Milken and others in the Drexel junk-bond department.   But attorneys said that defendants may find an overallsettlement attractive if Judge Pollack crafts it in a waythat takes care of all the claims. Some defendants have beenreluctant to settle with Drexel alone because they stillwould face claims from the other litigants.   Some attorneys compared it to a bankruptcy restructuring,in that such a settlement would bring together all relatedclaims and then resolve them in one process.   &quot;It makes an awful lot of sense,&quot; said Richard Greenfield,a plaintiffs' attorney in Philadelphia representing investorsin suits against Mr. Milken. Although the proposal appearsdaunting, Mr. Greenfield added, &quot;There were people who saidthe Drexel bankruptcy settlement couldn't be done.&quot;   An attorney familiar with the litigation said that thegoal of the negotiations would be to reach a settlement withabout a dozen of the key players in the alleged wrongdoinginvolving Drexel's junk-bond transactions.   ---   MERRELL-DOW WINS another Bendectin appeal.   The federal appeals court in California became the fourthfederal circuit court to reject a link between Bendectin, ananti-nausea prescription drug, and birth defects.   The plaintiffs, who suffer from limb defects and whosemothers took Bendectin during pregnancy, had sought damagesfrom the drug's maker, Merrell-Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. Butthe appeals court upheld a district court ruling that theplaintiff's medical evidence, having &quot;neither been publishednor subjected to the rigors of peer review,&quot; was unreliable.   A lawyer for the plaintiffs said they probably wouldappeal.   Although juries have granted generous Bendectin awards,all but one case has been thrown out on appeal. That case, inthe Third Circuit in Philadelphia, was sent back to a trialcourt for further review.   Fewer than 50 Bendectin claims remain nationwide, saidGlenn Forrester, corporate counsel for Merrell-Dow, which isnow a part of Marion Merrell Dow Inc. in Cincinnati.   ( Daubert vs. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., NinthCircuit Court of Appeals, 90-55397)   ---   MANVILLE CORP. plea agreement establishes $1 million trustfund in Ohio.   The Denver company agreed to establish the fund and pay a$25,000 fine after pleading no contest to a criminal chargethat it illegally dumped toxic waste in an Athens County,Ohio, landfill. A no-contest plea means the defendant won'tfight the charges but doesn't explicitly acknowledge guilt.   Ohio Attorney General Lee Fisher, whose office prosecutedthe case, said the trust fund payment reflects the largestsettlement of a criminal environmental charge against acorporation in Ohio history. The Manville trust fund will beused to finance environmental education and theinvestigation, enforcement and prosecution of stateenvironmental cases. Athens County will receive $185,000 fromthe fund over the next five years to clean up anotherlandfill there.   ---   FDIC FAILS to get rehearing in case affecting collectionefforts.   U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater of Dallas declinedlast week to reconsider his Dec. 5 decision that limits theability of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to forceborrowers to repay fraudulently obtained loans.   The case involved two Dallas real estate developers whosought bankruptcy court protection. The FDIC argued that thedevelopers shouldn't be able to use bankruptcy to escape fullliability for loans from a defunct thrift because thedevelopers had concealed the true use of the loan proceeds.The borrowers countered that the thrift officers were awarethat the use was misstated on the loan applications.   Judge Fitzwater said the FDIC couldn't prove it had reliedon the misrepresentation, as he said was required under theU.S. Bankruptcy Code. The agency is expected to appeal.   ( FDIC v.
