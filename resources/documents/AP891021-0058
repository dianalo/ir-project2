(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rockwell International Corp. willclose the nuclear ``hot lab'' at its Rocketdyne division plant, afacility besieged by protests from nearby residents andanti-nuclear activists.   Rocketdyne President Bob Paster defended the nuclear safetytrack record of the field laboratory in a statement announcing thedecision Friday. He said community pressure contributed to thedecision to close the lab.   ``While the hot lab poses no threat to safety, health or theenvironment, we hope closure of the facility will allay concernsand will assure the public of our commitment to the community inwhich we live and work,'' Paster said in the prepared statement.   Rockwell, which was pursuing a 10-year renewal of a specialnuclear materials license to operate the hot lab, will insteadrequest a one-year extension lasting through next October, tocomplete existing work and file a decontamination plan with theNuclear Regulatory Commission.   Most of the work at the lab was ``decladding,'' the taking apartof nuclear fuel to remove the plutonium and uranium for shipment toapproved DOE storage sites. The last of the decladding work wasdone in 1986, but the lab continued to handle nuclear material.   Rocketdyne critics and neighbors applauded the announcement.   ``That is great! That is the best news I've heard in a longtime,'' said Jim Werner, of the Natural Resources Defense Council,an environmental group that opposed the lab's relicensing bid.   Opponents contended the plant leaked small amounts ofradioactivity, but U.S. Department of Energy and state and federalenvironmental agencies all reported that conditions there do notpose an immediate health risk.   The amount of radioactivity to be handled in the hot lab for theremainder of its life will be less than that found ``in a typicalneighborhood hospital radiation therapy unit,'' company officialssaid.   The shutdown of the lab wasn't expected to cause any job lossesor adversely affect the company's business, officials said.   Established in the late 1940s, the lab is near Simi Valley,about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
