Both futures prices and the weather are notoriouslydifficult to forecast, and predicting both of them togetheris especially tricky. But that's exactly what futures tradersmay have to do in the months ahead if El Nino pays anothervisit.</LP><TEXT>   El Nino, which means the Christ Child in Spanish, is thename fishermen have given to a long-range weather phenomenonthat many times has appeared around Christmas. It starts withabnormal warming of the surface waters of the equatorialPacific. The warmer these waters get, the more weatherpatterns are changed and growing conditions are affected inthe tropical latitudes. That's what makes El Nino profoundlyinteresting to futures traders.   During the El Nino of 1972-73, for example, soybean mealfutures prices leaped 290% in about eight months, while livehog prices rose 130%, at least in part due to higher feedcosts, and orange juice futures dropped 24% as the winterturned warm. The El Nino of 1982-83 caused cocoa prices tojump nearly 70% from the late fall of 1982 to the summer of1983, and heating oil sank 30% during the middle of theheating season as much of the Northeastern U.S. turned warm.   There's some debate whether El Nino is forming. The seasurface temperature in the equatorial Pacific near theInternational date line is currently warmer than normal. ButVernon Kousky, research meteorologist at the Climate AnalysisCenter, part of the National Oceanographic and AtmosphericAdministration, says other signs aren't in evidence yet. Now&quot;is the critical time if it's going to develop,&quot; he adds.   Among the other signs, says Steve Lyons, associateprofessor of meteorology at the University of Hawaii atManoa, are the large thunderstorms typically produced in theareas of the warm sea water. So far, he says, such activityhas been weak.   Routine ocean-warming occurs annually around Christmas offthe coasts of Ecuador and northern Peru. Normally, the oceanwater there is cool and rich in nutrients, supporting thePeruvian anchovy fishery, one of the largest in the world. Awarm southward current displaces the cool water, reducing theupward flow of nutrients and slightly disrupting the anchovyfishing.   However, at irregular intervals El Nino is much moreintense, extensive and prolonged, with the ocean temperaturestaying high for more than a year. Such relatively intense ElNinos occurred in 1953, 1957-58, 1965, 1972-73, 1976-77,1982-83 and 1986-87. Today, scientists apply the term El Ninoonly to these intense events rather than the mild annualwarmings.   The El Nino that occurred in 1982-83 was a &quot;100-yearevent,&quot; says Mr. Kousky of Climate Analysis Center, meaninghe believes that another of equal magnitude probably won'thappen again until well into the next century. During thatoccurrence, tropical fish were seen as far north asCalifornia; disastrous flooding struck the Pacific coast; adrought settled over Australia and the drought in the Sahelin Africa grew worse, and the monsoon over the Indiansubcontinent weakened.   Mr. Kousky says he isn't certain the El Nino pattern willdevelop any further this year. But Kevin Marcus, director ofCrop Cast Services of Rockville, Md., asserts that the ElNino has arrived, based on such weather phenomena as: heavyrainfall in the great basin in the Western U.S.; droughtconditions running from Australia through Indonesia and thePhilippines; above-normal rainfall in Argentina and Uruguay,and isolated heavy rains in the high Andes mountains.   Paul Handler, professor of physics at the University ofIllinois and head of his crop and climate consulting companyin Champaign, Ill., predicts a full-blown El Nino. Heattributes many major climatic effects to the aerosols spewedup by major volcanic explosions. This summer's eruption byMt. Pinatubo in the Philippines will certainly produce an ElNino, he says, though because the eruption was in June itwill &quot;take a little bit longer for this one to get started.&quot;The connection between volcanic explosions and El Ninos isn'taccepted by many climatologists.   The potential impact on commodity prices isn't cut anddried, either. Ann Frick, soybean analyst for PrudentialSecurities Inc. in New York, says a fully developed El Ninowould lend strength to soybean oil futures. That would happenmainly because El Nino-caused periods of prolonged dryness inSoutheast Asia would reduce production of competing palm oilin Malaysia and Indonesia, and of coconut oil from thePhilippines. She notes that world trade in Malaysian palm oildwarfs the exports of soybean oil from the U.S., Argentinaand Brazil combined.   Ms. Frick says that if an El Nino forms, it won't affectsoybean oil and meal prices as sharply as in 1972-73. Then,Peruvian fish meal accounted for approximately 45% of worldprotein trade, says Ms. Frick. Today, because of theworld-wide explosion in oil seed crop production, fish mealis roughly 20 times less important than it was then. Manyanalysts attribute the explosive growth of soybean productionin Brazil and Argentina to the 1972-73 El Nino as the worldclamored for high protein meal for livestock feed.   Some analysts believe that El Ninos can have a profoundeffect on U.S. winter weather. Mr. Marcus of Crop Cast saysEl Ninos generally produce an active storm track thatprevents Canadian air from reaching Florida in the winter,making winter in the Southeast both mild and wet. Also, hesays, El Ninos can cause heavy snowfalls in the Northeast inlate winter, such as in February 1983 and January 1987.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          The hog market will react today to an AgricultureDepartment report that the U.S. swine population is expandingrapidly.   The quarterly survey, which was released after the closeof trading Friday, put the Sept. 1 swine herd at 59.3million, up 6% from the year-ago date.   The report was in line with analysts' expectations but itcould have a bearish impact on the market. The expansionsignals that hog prices will probably slip to the low 40cents a pound range by November, said Jerry Abbenhaus, alivestock analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, St. Louis.   Hog farmers expanded their herds relatively rapidly thissummer because hog prices were still profitable even thoughprices had fallen sharply from 1990 levels. The big break incattle prices this summer, however, prompted ranchers toslash their sales of young cattle to feedlots because pricesturned unprofitable.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          Has the rainy season finally arrived in Brazil?   Forecasts for rain over the weekend sent prices tumblingFriday. Coffee for December delivery ended 3.65 cents a poundlower at 85.7 cents.   Judith Ganes, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch, said ifrain continues falling, coffee prices could drop to newcontract lows. Prices have been buoyed lately by dry weatherin Brazil, which reminded traders of the 1985 drought.   The possibility of a plan by producers to withhold coffeefrom the market has also lifted prices recently, but the planfailed to gain approval at the International CoffeeOrganization meeting last week. The producer coffee-retentionplan is dead, Ms. Ganes said.</TEXT></DOC>
