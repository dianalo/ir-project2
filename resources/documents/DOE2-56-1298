Fe/sub 2/B boride phase crystals precipitate on the austenitegrain boundaries at low-speed cooling of Fe-B-C system low-carbon alloys.Boride+borocementite two-phase inclusions are observed along with borideat the increase of carbon content over 0.15 mass.%, while at carbon contentover 0.40 mass.% - only borocementite is observed. Borocementite formsbroken grid along the austenite grain boundaries and is found as compactinclusions inside the grains as well. Within alloys of Fe-B-C systemalong with standard pearlite there occur the parts of more coarse, non-etchingat thermal etching pearlite, where boron atoms are substituted for negligiblepart of carbon atoms.</TEXT></DOC>
