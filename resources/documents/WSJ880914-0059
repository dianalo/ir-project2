The rating concern upgraded Armco's senior notes, sinking fund debentures and tax-exempt revenue bonds to single-B-1 from single-B-2; lease-backed revenue bonds to single-B-2 from single-B-3; and cumulative convertible preferred stock to single-B-2 from single-B-3. Moody's cited Armco's improved operating performance achieved, in part, through a broad range of cost reductions and productivity enhancements. The upgrading, it said, also reflects Armco's progress &quot;in achieving a more conservative capital structure&quot; and in focusing on its core steel operations. &quot;Armco's future performance will reflect the fundamental cyclicality of its core businesses, though the actions taken by the company to reduce costs and improve its competitive position have reduced these cyclical risks,&quot; Moody's said.    ---   MASCO Corp. -- Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it gave a single-A rating to Masco's issue of $300 million in 9 1/4% senior notes due 1993. The proceeds will be used to reduce bank debt. The rating concern cited the &quot;good operating track record and strong management team&quot; at the maker of building and home improvement products, which is based in Troy, Mich. </TEXT></DOC>
