The discovery, made in a study with the University of California, Berkeley, is the first to conclusively identify the genes in strands of hair, Cetus said.    The process would allow investigators to classify individuals into 21 different types, according to the genetic makeup of their hair. Matching the makeup of hair found at a crime scene with those of a suspect would help police &quot;narrow the field of suspects,&quot; a Cetus official said.    The process, known as polymerase chain reaction gene amplification, amplifies specific regions of a gene from as little as a single molecule of DNA found in even months-old shed hair, Cetus said.    Cetus, a maker of biological products, said it will collaborate with Rochester, N.Y.-based Eastman Kodak Co. to introduce a hair analysis kit that could be used by police crime laboratories. The kit would be available in 1989, at the earliest. A company spokesman declined to say what the kit would sell for or to predict the product's market value.    In recent decisions, U.S. courts have been split on the issue of whether genetic-engineering technology can be used to link suspects to crimes, with some courts arguing that the technology is too new and untried. </TEXT></DOC>
