The internal surface was about 1000 m/sup 2/,the volume {similar_to} 200 m/sup 3/ and the installed pumping speedfor hydrogen {similar_to} 8500 l s/sup -1/. At the operating temperatureof 300/sup 0/C the base pressure was {similar_to} 2 x 10/sup -7/ mbar(hydrogen) and {similar_to} 3 x 10/sup -10/ mbar for other gases. Plasmaoperation showed that the metallic walls suffered damage due to energeticelectrons; a few kilogrammes of the wall material were melted and theplasma contaminated. Consequently the vacuum vessel was progressivelycovered in graphite tiles. Today, in addition to other graphite components,more than 50% of the internal surface consists of high-purity fine-graingraphite tiles with an average thickness of 20 mm. The total weight ofall installed graphite elements is about six tons. Surfaces not protectedby graphite tiles are shielded by a thin carbon layer ({similar_to} 1{mu}m thickness) deposited by plasma activated chemical vapour deposition.This paper summarizes the requirements for and the design of the JETvacuum vessel and details the conditioning techniques employed to achievegood plasma operation. It describes the transition from an initiallyall metal vessel to an essentially graphite chamber and presents theoperational experiences.</TEXT></DOC>
