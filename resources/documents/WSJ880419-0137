The political crisis stems from the passage last week by the Folketing, or parliament, of a one-paragraph resolution requiring the government to inform visiting warships of a 31-year-old ban on nuclear weapons in Danish territory.    The measure goes beyond existing anti-nuclear policies of other member countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and raised criticism from the U.S., Britain and NATO -- all of which maintain a policy against disclosing anything that might identify which of their vessels carry nuclear weapons. The policy led the U.S. and Britain in 1984 to cut off military cooperation with New Zealand after it began requiring naval vessels to affirm they weren't carrying nuclear weapons.    In a statement over the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said Washington is &quot;deeply distressed&quot; by the Danish resolution, which he said undercut NATO's nuclear deterrence.    &quot;This is not only or principally a U.S.-Danish issue,&quot; Mr. Shultz said. &quot;It goes to the very heart of the meaning and interlocking nature of our mutual commitments within the NATO alliance.&quot;    Lord Carrington, NATO's secretary general, said in Brussels that the Danish measure, if implemented, could have &quot;extremely serious consequences.&quot; And diplomats here said Britain has warned that it won't send Denmark military reinforcements, even in wartime, as long as the new policy is in place.    Responding to those concerns, Denmark's defense minister, Bernt Johan Collet, yesterday said the country's conservative-led minority government, which opposed the resolution, will call an early election for next month rather than implement a law that could jeopardize the country's NATO membership. He characterized the election as a virtual referendum on NATO membership.    &quot;There is no doubt about the seriousness with which the U.S. and NATO view this resolution,&quot; he said. NATO defense ministers in Brussels are scheduled to meet tomorrow to consider the new Danish position, he said, and will review it again a week later at a previously scheduled meeting in Jutland, Denmark, of NATO's senior-level Nuclear Planning Group.    Mr. Collet predicted that Prime Minister Poul Schlueter, also a conservative, would announce the snap election Thursday for next month. Denmark held its last national election last September, and new balloting wasn't due for 3 1/2 more years.    It is ironic that the political crisis arises from a dispute over security policy. Until now, Mr. Schlueter's coalition has ignored parliamentary defeats on such questions, sustaining 22 defeats on defense issues since coming to power in 1982.    But Mr. Collet said the possible repercussions of last week's resolution required the government to hold its ground. &quot;We have to make clear that we want to be a member of NATO,&quot; he said.    It isn't clear whether Denmark could remain a NATO member if the Folketing resolution were passed. There isn't any provision in the North Atlantic Treaty, of which Denmark was a founding signatory in 1949, permitting the expulsion of any of its 16 members.    Politicians appeared in agreement that they want this Social Democracy of 5.3 million people to remain in NATO. Gert Petersen, leader of the left-wing Socialist People's Party, which introduced the idea of tightening Denmark's anti-nuclear policy and favors a non-aligned foreign policy, said his party accepts that &quot;a majority of Denmark wants to stay in NATO.&quot; He said the resolution wasn't intended to test Denmark's role in NATO. </TEXT></DOC>
