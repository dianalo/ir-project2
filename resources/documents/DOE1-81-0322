The conversion factors were determinedbased on calculation assuming a Gaussian plume model as a function ofatmospheric stability, down-wind distance and flight height. First, theconversion factors for plumes emitting mono-energy gamma rays were calculated,then, conversion factors were constructed through convolution for theradionuclides essential in an accident of a nuclear reactor, and formixtures of these radionuclides considering elapsed time after shutdown.These conversion factors are shown in figures, and also polynomial expressionsof the conversion factors as a function of height have been decided withthe least-squares method. A user can easily obtain proper conversionfactors from data shown here.</TEXT></DOC>
