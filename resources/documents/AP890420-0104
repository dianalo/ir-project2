U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell was to instruct the juryon the legal principles it must apply in deciding whether North isinnocent or guilty.   The court session followed a delay of several hours, apparentlyover a news report that two jurors had not admitted involvement inunrelated court actions in the past.   One courthouse source said the delay stemmed from a storybroadcast Wednesday night that two jurors and an alternate hadfailed to mention prior court proceedings in which they had beeninvolved. The source spoke on condition of anonymity.   Five alternates have sat with the 12-member jury since openingstatements in North's trial on Feb. 21.   ABC News reported that two of the panelists, Caswell G.Hartridge, 61, and Helen G. Lynch, 37, had been named as defendantsin civil litigation involving accidents in the early 1980s.   Both answered ``no'' on jury questionnaires asking them whetherthey had ``ever been involved as a party ... in any courtproceedings (civil or criminal).''   ABC also reported that the first alternate juror, Joseph L.Ward, 33, who answered ``no'' to the same question, had beenarrested in 1974 on a charge of sale and possession of narcotics.He was placed on probation for a year, the network said. He alsowas arrested in 1987 on a marijuana possession charge but wasn'tprosecuted, it said.   In final arguments to the jury Wednesday, defense lawyer BrendanSullivan declared that the government ``has not shown criminalbehavior'' by North, concluding: ``I ask you to set him free.''   But prosecutor John Keker said North has refused to acknowledgethat he did anything wrong even though he openly admits lying toCongress and shredding evidence. ``It's time for you to do it forhim,'' Keker told the jurors.   Gesell's jury instructions regarding criminal intent coulddetermine whether North's defense stands or falls. Defense lawyersasked the judge to include several instructions favorable to North,including that following orders in good faith negates criminalintent.   Sullivan told the jury that President Reagan used North as ``asacrificial lamb'' when he fired the National Security Council aideon Nov. 25, 1986.   ``The president was using Ollie North as a scapegoat and threwhim overboard to escape some political heat,'' the defense lawyersaid.   Keker, with a Shakespearian flourish, dismissed Sullivan'sclosing arguments as ``all sound and fury, signifying nothing.'' Hesaid North clearly committed the criminal acts with which he ischarged.   Jury instructions could be especially important on the chargethat North obstructed Congress on Aug. 6, 1986, by denying to theHouse Intelligence Committee that he was assisting the NicaraguanContras during a congressional ban on U.S. aid to the rebels.   North testified that he lied to the panel, but said he went tothe meetingagainst his wishes on orders from national securityadviser John Poindexter. Poindexter subsequently sent North a notesaying, ``well done.''   The defense also is relying on the fact that only sketchy noteswere taken at the meeting and that North was not sworn to tell thetruth during the session.   ``It's almost like a trap,'' said Sullivan. ``When they don'tlike what they hear and after a big investigation, 2{ years laterlet's charge Ollie North with lying at the meeting.''   Jury instructions regarding criminal intent also could becritical on the charge that North illegally accepted a $13,800security system from co-defendant Richard Secord.   The fact that Secord paid for the security system is uncontested.   ``Ollie North is not a saint,'' Sullivan said in discussing thatcount. But he said North had a well-founded fear for his life afterterrorist Abu Nidal targeted him for assassination.   Sullivan said North ``tried to get some help from thegovernment'' but was rebuffed.   ``Isn't there a time in life when friends can still help out?''asked Sullivan. ``The government wants you to convict Ollie Northfor accepting a security gate.''   North's lawyers asked that the jury be instructed to acquit himon the count if it finds that he acted under duress.   Other charges against North are that he lied to Congress in 1985and the attorney general in November 1986, destroyed documents,converted travelers checks to his own use and conspired to defraudthe U.S. Treasury.   He faces a maximum 60 years in prison and $3 million in fines ifconvicted on all counts.</TEXT></DOC>
