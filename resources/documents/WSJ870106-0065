Under Mr. Reagan's recommendations, salaries for members of the House and Senate would rise $12,100 to $89,500 a year, and cabinet secretaries' pay would rise $10,700 to $99,500. Federal district court judges' salaries would increase to $89,500, a $8,400 raise. These levels will automatically take effect unless Congress rejects them.    The Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries last month proposed pay raises ranging from about $50,000 to $75,000 a year for these and other top government officials. The panel said these officials have experienced a 40% decline in purchasing power since 1969.    Citing the need to shrink the deficit, Mr. Reagan said he couldn't fully adopt the panel's recommendations, but said he expects to recommend another raise before leaving office.    Ralph Nader and his group -- called &quot;Stop the Congressional Salary Grab,&quot; -- as well as some conservative groups oppose both the raises and the 1985 law that lets them take effect unless both houses of Congress pass bills of disapproval. Paul Weyrich, president of the conservative Coalition for America, said last week that he's asked members of his group to work with Nader supporters to oppose the raises.    On Sunday, designated Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) said the Senate will take a yes-or-no vote on the pay recommendations. It's unclear whether the House will vote on them. </TEXT></DOC>
