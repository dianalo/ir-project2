They predicted that rates will hold at current levels probablyuntil after the November election, but they conceded that thisforecast is contingent on a slowdown in overall economic growth.   If this expected slowdown does not occur and inflationarypressures remain high, then their interest rate forecasts will beproven wrong, analysts said.   Big banks raised their prime lending rate one-half percentgepoint to 9.5 percent on Thursday. It was the second boost this yearand put the key borrowing rate at its highest level since March1986.   The increase followed by one day stern warnings from FederalReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that the central bank stood readyto tighten credit even further if inflation shows signs ofworsening.   Some economists said Greenspan's tough talk put financialmarkets on notice that the central bank will be pushing interestrates higher in the weeks ahead.   But other analysts read Greenspan's comments as a signal thatwhile the Fed did tighten credit conditions significantly from lateMarch to late June, the tightening process is over for the timebeing.   For one thing, Greenspan appeared to downplay prospects that thecentral bank soon would hike its discount rate, which has been at 6percent since last September.   An increase in the discount rate, the interest the Fed chargesto make loans to financial institutions, is the most dramaticsignal the central bank can send of its intentions to tightencredit.   In the first five months of the year, retail prices increased atan annual rate of 4.4 percent, the inflation rate for all of 1987,and inflation appeared to be slightly stronger in the last fewmonths than earlier this year.   Greenspan made it clear that he believed unemployment, whichdropped to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in June, cannot go muchlower without risking accelerating wage demands and higherinflation. But he indicated that he expected both the unemploymentrate and current high factory operating rates will begin levelingoff in the months ahead.   Analysts said these two indicators of economic strength, alongwith the various measurements of inflation, will be the key ones towatch to determine future interest rate moves.   ``Greenspan's testimony indicates that the central bank expectsthe economy to soften and inflation to settle down in the secondhalf of the year,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the BostonCo. ``If that forecast comes true, then there will be no need forthe Fed to tighten further.''   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., said thelatest increase in the prime rate was in response to the Fedtightening which has already occurred.   Greenspan indicated that over the past three months the Fed haspushed up a key short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate,by a full percentage point.   The federal funds rate is the interest banks charge each otherfor overnight loans and it is heavily influenced by Fed decisionson bank reserves.   ``The hike in the prime rate is not the start of something new.It is simply a reflection of the earlier tightening steps,'' Jonessaid. ``I think we will see interest rates remain stable at theselevels for the next few months.''   David Wyss, chief financial economist of Data Resources Inc.,predicted a period of steady interest rates between now and theNovember election, saying that neither the Fed nor major banks wantto risk getting embroiled in the presidential campaign by makingfurther tightening moves.   Wyss said that based on banks' cost of funds, an increase of0.25 percentage points in the prime rate on Thursday would havebeen more justified than the one-half percentage point increasewhich did occur.   ``I think the banks wanted to get all of the bad news out of theway before the election,'' Wyss said. ``The closer you get to anelection, the harder it is to raise rates because the morepolitically sensitive such a decision is.''   While predicting a period of stable rates for now, manyeconomists said they believed rates will head higher before the endof the year, in part because of a belief that inflation will remainhigher than the Fed will be willing to tolerate.   Some analysts said they were looking for fixed-rate mortages,which are currently at 10.4 percent, to be around 11 percent by theend of the year. They said they expected one more rise in the primerate, as well, after the election, boosting it to 10 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
