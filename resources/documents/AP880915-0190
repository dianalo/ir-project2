Temporary catastrophe offices will be opened in Texas to helpresidents and businesses begin the process of adjusting and payinglosses, according to the Insurance Information Institute.   ``The catpool will also have personnel in the field,'' said DonManthe, chairman of the Texas Catastrophe Property InsuranceAssociation, or TCPIA, known as catpool. ``We will move our mobileoffice to the landfall area jut as soon as it's safe.''   The catpool provides windstorm and hail coverage for manycoastal residents. It paid $156 million in losses in 1983 as aresult of Hurricane Alicia.   In Louisiana, where some home owners sought additional stormcoverage and new flood insurance this week, it was too late formany to buy protection against the hurricane.   Most insurance companies stopped writing storm-damage coverageby Wednesday morning. And homeowners gave up the idea of buying newflood insurance after learning that a new policy would not takeeffect for five days.   ``I personally turned down a half-million-dollar risk,'' saidRandy Maddox, president of Morrison Insurance Agency in NewOrleans. The independent agency represents Aetna and the Hartfordand a number of other companies.   Maddox said he even turned down his own father's request foradditional coverage. ``It doesn't matter who it is,'' he said.   Several large companies, including State Farm and Allstate,stopped doing new business at 10 a.m. Wednesday. Others stoppedTuesday afternoon.   Gabrielle Rostran, office manager at the Angelo Leone State Farmagency, said 30 or 40 customers called Wednesday seeking additionalstorm coverage or flood insurance.   The information institute said flood damage as a result ofhurricanes is covered under special flood insurance policies issuedunder the National Flood Insurance Program, which is operated bythe federal government.   Hardship cases will be settled first, the institute said in astatement.</TEXT></DOC>
