<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-64-0713 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new algorithm, along with an initial-guess procedure, has been developedfor the steady-state simulation of a multicomponent, multistage absorber.The algorithm is applicable to systems with trace contaminants such asH/sub 2/S and to systems where the phase equilibria are dependent oncomposition. The equations describing the steady-state operation of amulticomponent N-stage absorber are expressed in 2N, nonlinear, coupledconvergence functions. In contrast to past algorithms that often usednumerical derivatives, this variable-pairing algorithm uses an iterativesolution of mass and energy balances that does not need derivatives.The new algorithm has been demonstrated on a methanol-CO/sub 2/-CH/sub4/-H/sub 2/S system where the vapor-liquid equilibrium was describedwith a Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state.</TEXT></DOC>
