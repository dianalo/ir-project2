The sermon is about assets.    &quot;I don't care whether it's a tank truck, a chemical plant, a refinery, an oil field or a typewriter . . . look at it as if it were your own investment,&quot; Mr. Stegemeier tells his corporate flock. And if that asset doesn't produce an appropriate profit, and won't soon, then consider selling it, he advises.    What's gospel at the oil company these days was heresy not long ago. Fred L. Hartley, who retired July 1 after 24 years as chief executive, firmly rejected asset sales to cut the company's vast debt. Mr. Hartley remains chairman. Mr. Stegemeier is president of the company as well as chief executive.    In his first interview since assuming control of the nation's 12th-largest oil concern, Mr. Hartley's hand-picked successor seems to be outlining a course significantly different from that of his former boss. &quot;I'm going to put my imprint on the company,&quot; he promises.    A number of challenges may make that difficult for Mr. Stegemeier, who is 60 years old. At current oil prices, Unocal's earnings are depressed. It is involved in chemicals that haven't benefited from the boom in that business. Prices for some assets it wants to sell are low. Capping these are the difficulties of managing an organization that was steered by another executive for nearly a quarter of a century.    Something Mr. Stegemeier insists doesn't concern him is the threat of a takeover -- despite persistent speculation that Unocal might make an inviting target. &quot;This company is just not for sale,&quot; he says, adding that &quot;if we spend time looking over our shoulder at what's chasing us down the road, we really can't do a very good job of running the company.&quot;    Within days of his appointment as chief executive, Unocal announced plans to sell its headquarters building and 13 surrounding acres in Los Angeles for what real-estate specialists said may total between $175 million and $250 million. And the prospective changes don't stop there.    Among the assets on the company's &quot;watch list,&quot; Mr. Stegemeier says, are its shale-oil operations and the remaining business at the Beaumont, Texas, refinery. Unocal's mothballed molybdenum and uranium mines likewise are on the list. And millions of dollars of real estate other than the headquarters already is on the block.    Moreover, Mr. Stegemeier says the company would consider joint ownership for its 150,000-barrel-a-day Chicago refinery and marketing network -- although Unocal isn't specifically seeking such an arrangement. Neither does he reject out of hand the possible sale of Unocal's vast geothermal operations, although he adds that these plants -- which extract steam from underground formations to make electricity -- aren't on the &quot;watch list&quot; and that there is no immediate reason to sell them. Industry analysts put the value of the geothermal operations at $700 million or more.    &quot;We're accelerating this asset sale thing; we're moving right along,&quot; says Mr. Stegemeier.    Under Mr. Hartley, Unocal clung fiercely to its assets even as it struggled to lighten a long-term debt load that had swelled to $5.5 billion during a huge company stock-repurchase program that helped end a clash with Texas takeover baron T. Boone Pickens Jr. The long-term debt at June 30 totaled $4.3 billion.    Mr. Hartley held firmly to operations when oil prices plunged in 1986, saying there would no &quot;fire sale.&quot; The vast debt, Mr. Hartley said, should be repaid mostly out of normal cash flows. Critics who urged the company to sell assets were labeled opportunists by Mr. Hartley and accused of trying to torpedo the company.    But roles changed over time on the top floor of Unocal's offices here, Mr. Stegemeier says. &quot;Fred has slowly, for the last year or so, been turning over more and more of the duties to me.&quot; Mr. Hartley's successor reports that he has been running the executive committee for the past year or so.    Henceforth, Mr. Stegemeier says he &quot;will be responsible for running the company,&quot; adding that the 71-year-old Mr. Hartley &quot;. . . is no longer an employee . . . is no longer operating the company . . . is no longer making decisions.&quot;    There are differences between the two men, Mr. Stegemeier notes with a smile. Though he asserts that he's as tough as Mr. Hartley, Mr. Stegemeier says, &quot;Fred has a reputation of being crusty and grumpy and, more recently, a curmudgeon; I don't qualify as a curmudgeon yet.&quot;    People both inside and outside Unocal believe Mr. Stegemeier's elevation marks a significant change. Now, &quot;there are a heck of a lot fewer sacred cows than there were,&quot; says Eugene Nowak, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    One of the most sacred under Mr. Hartley -- Unocal's troubled $650 million shale-oil plant -- &quot;is under intense scrutiny,&quot; according to Mr. Stegemeier. Designed to extract 10,000 barrels a day of synthetic oil from Colorado shale, the plant currently is producing barely half that. It is expected to drain about $30 million in cash this year, although the facility already has been written off.    At 8,000 barrels a day, the plant would have a positive cash flow. And it may be given until the end of the year to hit that target. If it doesn't, however, the plant that Mr. Hartley championed through years of failure is doomed.    Which of the remaining cows are sacred? Mr. Stegemeier leaves that a bit unclear. But outsiders generally point to the company's oil and natural-gas operations, and to its West Coast refining and marketing, as core businesses.    The executive notes that Unocal, despite its debt-reduction program, has pushed efforts to acquire exploratory land. Moreover, Unocal is believed to be bidding on a refinery near Los Angeles operated by a unit of Union Pacific Corp. -- an acquisition that could cost several hundred million dollars. &quot;We're not just servicing debt and letting everything else fall off the wagon,&quot; says Mr. Stegemeier.    Debt, however, remains the preoccupation. &quot;We have to manage the cash flow and the debt -- that just supersedes everything else we do,&quot; says Mr. Stegemeier, adding that the goal is to reduce debt as a proportion of total capital to about 50% from about 70% currently. At the peak, debt accounted for 80% of Unocal's total capital.    Mr. Stegemeier says that, at current oil prices, it will be hard for the company to carve more than about $300 million annually from its remaining long-term debt load.    By itself, this is no change from the company's view under Mr. Hartley -- although proceeds from asset sales could pay down the debt a good deal faster. Mr. Stegemeier says he plans a deliberate approach to redeploying assets and debt reduction. &quot;We're not going to be loose cannons,&quot; he says. &quot;It's easier to wreck a company than to build one. And I'm a builder, not a wrecker.&quot;    Among Mr. Stegemeier's early building projects: a cadre of younger managers at high levels, after years of domination by veterans close to Mr. Hartley. Under Mr. Hartley's strong hand, fearful middle managers often booted petty decisions upstairs. &quot;We're trying to get more responsibility and accountability deeper in the organization,&quot; Mr. Stegemeier explains.    Within days after taking charge, he named four younger vice presidents and told directors that spending authority for senior officers was being almost doubled -- the first boost in eight years.    Other signals have been sent. Analysts were delighted by Unocal's second-quarter reporting -- not so much by the earnings, which at $64 million, or 55 cents a share, on $2.55 billion of revenue, were little changed from a year earlier, despite an overall nonrecurring gain of $19 million -- because of the astonishing thoroughness with which it presented the numbers. For the first time, Unocal disclosed quarterly results from different sectors of its business, as other major oil companies do.    Where Mr. Hartley almost never met with securities analysts, Mr. Stegemeier plans a September tour to meet with almost 1,000 analysts and investors in a halfdozen cities.    &quot;They're peeling off the veil that was placed by Mr. Hartley,&quot; says Marc D. Cohen, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. </TEXT></DOC>
