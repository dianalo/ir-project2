President Bush, who announced the move at a cabinetmeeting, said Mr. Thornburgh had agreed to remain attorneygeneral through the end of July to continue lobbying oncontroversial civil-rights and anti-crime legislation. Mr.Bush didn't name a replacement.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Thornburgh, a former two-term governor ofPennsylvania, will run for the Senate seat previously held byJohn Heinz, a Republican who was killed in a plane crashApril 4. Mr. Thornburgh will face Democrat Harris Wofford,who holds the seat temporarily by appointment, in a specialelection Nov. 5. The winner will fill the unexpired term ofMr. Heinz, which runs through 1994.   Mr. Thornburgh, who had been under strong pressure fromfellow Republicans to run, is widely thought to be thefavorite in the race. Mr. Wofford, who was the state's laborsecretary, hasn't run for elective office.   Close associates say Mr. Thornburgh didn't want to leavehis cabinet post for a shot at becoming Pennsylvania's juniorsenator. A fierce advocate of executive-branch prerogative,he frequently expresses disdain for the legislative processgenerally and hasn't made many friends in Congress asattorney general.   But after postponing his decision as long as possible, Mr.Thornburgh acceded to party pleadings that he run as part ofa long-shot GOP drive to win a Senate majority. A centralreason for Mr. Thornburgh's decision, according toadministration officials, was to preserve the possibilitythat he someday could become a presidential candidate or seekanother term as Pennsylvania governor. If he didn't run nowfor the Senate, and the GOP lost the Pennsylvania seat, partyleaders probably would have blamed him and dismissed hisfuture aspirations. White House officials have said they viewMr. Thornburgh as the party's best candidate for thePennsylvania Senate seat.   Mr. Thornburgh lost a number of fans during his rockythree years as attorney general. Appointed late in the Reaganadministration, he initially was applauded by Republicans andDemocrats alike as a contrast to his predecessor, EdwinMeese, who left the post amid ethical controversy. But Mr.Thornburgh's reputation as a moderate, savvy politicianeroded swiftly. He fumbled in some early confirmation fightsand was attacked for relying too heavily on a secretive bandof Pennsylvania cronies.   President Bush publicly stuck by his attorney general,however, and praised his forceful advocacy on civil rightsand crime. &quot;We are going to miss his wisdom and his support,&quot;the president said at yesterday's cabinet meeting, with Mr.Thornburgh sitting at his side.   The president hasn't signaled a clear choice, or even ashort list of candidates, to succeed Mr. Thornburgh. Amongthose who have been discussed at the White House are MissouriGov. John Ashcroft, Deputy Attorney General William Barr,former California Gov. George Deukmejian, U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.),Solicitor General Kenneth Starr and Transportation SecretarySamuel Skinner.   Democrats questioned Mr. Thornburgh's decision to remainattorney general after deciding to run for elected office.&quot;Serious issues now facing our nation, such as crime, drugsand civil rights, should be addressed by the JusticeDepartment free from the pressures of a political campaign,&quot;said Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden of Delaware. AThornburgh spokesman responded that the attorney generalwon't campaign or accept contributions until he steps down.   Pennsylvania GOP officials said they would postpone theirparty nominating convention, currently scheduled for June 15,until after Mr. Thornburgh formally leaves the JusticeDepartment.</TEXT></DOC>
