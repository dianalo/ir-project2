The heat is removed from thegas as it flows along the pipeline bypassing coolant fluid along respectivelongtitudinal portions of the pipeline in heat exchange relationshiptherewith. At least a portion of the coolant fluid is refrigerated sothat the extent of heat removal along certain of the portions is suchas to change the state of various potential atmospheric pollutants fromthe gaseous to the liquid or solid phase; and the pollutants are separatedin their liquid or solid form from the residual gas substantially atthe respective portions of the pipeline, wherein the flow of gas containscarbon dioxide; wherein the gas is cooled to or about the subliming temperatureof the carbon dioxide, and wherein the cooled gas is passed into a gravitysettlement expansion chamber for sublimation into carbon dioxide snowand settlement along with other particulate matter carried by the gas.</TEXT></DOC>
