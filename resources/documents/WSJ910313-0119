In what may be the first state appeals court decision todeal with this issue, the court said that absenteeism due tochild care requirements doesn't constitute &quot;misconduct&quot; andthus doesn't disqualify the worker from receiving thebenefits. However, the court didn't question the employer'sright to fire a worker who is often absent.</LP><TEXT>   Although child care is a pervasive issue in the workplace,the unemployment benefits issue is usually handled out ofcourt on a case-by-case basis, and thus no broad rule haspreviously emerged.   &quot;This is a hidden problem. Most of these disputes areresolved in unreported, administrative proceedings,&quot; saysSally F. Goldfarb, a senior staff attorney with NOW LegalDefense and Education Fund.   The Minnesota case isn't binding in any other state.However, as apparently the only case on the books involvingthe issue, it is likely to be especially influential oncourts and administrative agencies confronting the questionin other states.   The dissenting judge in the case wrote that the panel'sdecision will force employers into a &quot;Catch 22&quot; position:Either put up with extensive absences or pay for theresulting unemployment at &quot;potentially great expense.&quot; InMinnesota and many other states, employers pay a percentageof payroll based on their previous unemployment rates into astate unemployment compensation fund.   The plaintiff in the Minnesota case, Diane McCourtney, wasemployed for 10 years as a full-time accounts payable clerkat Imprimis Technology Inc. of Minnetonka. In September 1989,she gave birth to an infant who suffered from respiratoryillnesses. The baby's father and other members of the familywere unable to assist with child care. As a result, Ms.McCourtney was frequently absent from work. After severalwritten and oral warnings, she was discharged for excessiveabsenteeism.   Like most states, Minnesota bars individuals dischargedfor misconduct from receiving unemployment compensation. Thestate Department of Jobs and Training determined that Ms.McCourtney wasn't entitled to her benefits because she hadsome child-care alternatives and had violated attendancestandards her employer had a right to impose.   But in its 2-1 decision on Monday, the appeals panel ruledthat Ms. McCourtney had made serious efforts to find care forher child but the cost of day-care or hiring a nanny wereprohibitive, given her income. The panel ruled that Ms.McCourtney's inability to find child care didn't constitutemisconduct. &quot;McCourtney's actions were motivated by a willfulregard for her child's interests and not a wanton disregardof her employer's interest or lack of concern for her job,&quot;the court wrote.   A lawyer for Imprimis Technology said that he couldn'tcomment on the decision because he had not spoken with hisclients.   But employment lawyers representing corporations say thedecision may force companies to bear the costs of what hasbecome a widespread social problem. &quot;Being able to come towork is one of the bedrock requirements that employers havethought was solid. And yet this case directly confronts thisbasic principle,&quot; says Carolyn Chalmers, a Minneapolisemployment lawyer.   Lawrence Meuwissen, the St. Paul lawyer for Ms.McCourtney, cautioned that the Minnesota decision appears tobe limited to circumstancs in which the employee doesn't havereasonable and affordable child-care alternatives when thechild is sick. &quot;The crucial factor here was Diane had noother resources. She did not have a choice,&quot; Mr. Meuwissensaid.   Employment lawyers also note that the decision is part ofa growing effort by courts and legislatures to address childcare problems faced by working women. A number of statesrequire companies to allow employees to take time off for thebirth or adoption of a child, although they generally don'thave such requirements for the care for sick children. A 1990study by a Chicago executive search firm, Heidrick andamp;Struggles Inc., found that 17% of industrial and servicecompanies surveyed offer child-care programs for theiremployees' children.   But women's rights advocates say that the changes haven'tgone far enough and that child care remains out of reach forthe majority of working women and often doesn't accommodatesick children. &quot;I was a single parent for nine years and Iwent through six jobs during that time because my son wasfrequently sick. I ended up having to quit because myemployers held my absences against me,&quot; says Sharon Kinsella,the coordinator of a jobs hotline at 9 to 5, aCleveland-based national association of working women.   ---   WEIGHT RESTRICTIONS are eased for American Airlines'flight attendants.   The airline's action settles a long-running dispute withits 17,000-member flight attendants union. As part of thesettlement, the unit of AMR Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, agreedto reinstate more than 200 flight attendants who weredisciplined or let go. American also agreed to come up with anew height/weight chart for its flight attendants, 90% ofwhom are women.   The union and American seem to have reached middle groundbetween the airline's rule that flight attendants weigh after40 what they did in their early 20s and the union'sinsistence on no standards at all. In addition to twolawsuits by flight attendants, American was sued last Aprilby the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which chargedthat the company's weight rules discriminated against womenover the age of 40.   &quot;We are pleased with our victory,&quot; said Cheryle Leon,president of the Association of Professional FlightAttendants, in a statement. A spokesman for Americanconfirmed that the two sides, with the concurrence of theEEOC, had reached agreement. The settlement still must beapproved by a federal court in Fort Worth, where the twolawsuits and the EEOC challenge are pending.   American was the last airline to have inflexible weightrules. Two years ago Pan Am Corp. settled similar litigationwith its flight attendants and paid 115 employees $2.3million in lost wages. No cash is involved in the Americansettlement.   Most other airlines, such as United and Delta, havechanged to weight rules that vary with age. Some, such asNorthwest and Continental, have abandoned weight rules.   ---   NATIONAL APPROACH to asbestos cases should be considered,judges say.   The 27-judge U.S. Judicial Conference approved a 50-pagereport by a task force of federal judges on the asbestoslitigation problem, but only after diluting therecommendations. The conference of federal-court policymakers voted to recommend that Congress &quot;consider&quot; adopting anational solution that would compensate present and futurevictims of illness caused by exposure to asbestos. The draftreport used somewhat stronger language, repeatedly urgingCongress to &quot;enact&quot; a legislative solution.   Judicial Conference aides who briefed reporters on theclosed-door discussions said the dilution occurred becausesome judges thought it inappropriate for the judiciary tomake specific suggestions to Congress, except on matters ofcourt procedure.   There are some 30,000 asbestos cases in federal courts andtwice that many in state courts, and the number is increasingdaily. The cases take a long time to resolve, and manyworkers suffering from exposure to asbestos products aresuffering from forms of cancer or are dying before theircases are resolved.</TEXT></DOC>
