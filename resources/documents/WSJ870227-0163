Trading was described as nervous and volatile in London and heavy on the Tokyo exchange.    London's Financial Times industrial share index closed at 1601.7, up 16.8, and the 100-share index rose 7.1 points to 1980.2. It was the second consecutive record finish for both.    The London market opened higher and continued rising, then lost its gains and slipped into negative territory before recovering late in the day. &quot;It's been every way today,&quot; one trader said.    Some specialty chemical issues involved in efforts to combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome made big gains. Takeover speculation boosted some other shares, and international oil companies rose as buying by U.S. investors put pressure on traders who had short positions in the sector.    Other pharmaceuticals were hurt by profit-taking.    The gold mines index closed at 321.0, up 4.8.    Tokyo's Nikkei stock average surged 267.57 to finish at 20,453.90, more than 200 points above the previous record set Feb. 19. Volume was about 1.3 billion shares, down from 1.5 billion Wednesday. The stock exchange index rose 10.98 points to 1777.63.    Traders said bullish turnover in the drug sector accounted for much of yesterday's surge in the indexes, which came despite a preponderance of declining issues over advancing ones.    Active trading in pharmaceutical shares in New York Wednesday sparked a surge in the Japanese sector yesterday that was then augmented by heavy buying in construction and other domestic-demand issues. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained a modest 2.96 points on Wall Street Wednesday, a better performance in broader U.S. market indexes was viewed as a bullish signal by Tokyo investors as trading opened yesterday.    Optimism about increased Japanese government spending after last weekend's six-nation Paris economic accord again spurred domestic-oriented issues such as retailers and real estate concerns. Securities companies also continued to be strong amid the high stock turnover.    Export-related shares, including computers, electronics and car makers, were weaker as the dollar showed little change on the foreign-exchange market.    AIDS-related shares, which have been booming amid public debate in Japan over efforts to prevent the spread of the disease, were strong again yesterday, though some encountered profit-taking late in the day.    Utilities also fell on profit-taking induced by a decline in Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Co.'s shares. The utility sector has been performing in line with NTT because of speculation that utility companies will have a major role in plans to upgrade Japan's telecommunications system.    Traders said chances are good that Tokyo share prices will continue to advance, as volume and liquidity entering the market both remain high.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                            Feb. 25      Feb. 24      Year    U.S. .................... 266.2       265.3     + 16.7    Britain ................. 587.9       579.7     + 18.1    Canada .................. 381.2       383.1     + 14.4    Japan .................. 1061.9      1058.2     + 12.4    France .................. 428.1       426.5     +  4.9    Germany ................. 216.1       215.4     - 16.8    Hong Kong .............. 2026.8      2006.7     + 13.9    Switzerland ............. 186.0       183.2     -  7.4    Australia ............... 286.7       291.2     +  8.6    World index ............. 408.5       406.5     + 14.5</TEXT></DOC>
