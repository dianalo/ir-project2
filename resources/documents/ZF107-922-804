(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Off the Shelf Power at the Price Right Price Just because a candy bar thatonce cost a nickel now costs 75 cents, it's easy to believe everything costsmore these days.andP;  But not if you're buying personal computers! The 12 20-Mhz80386-based PCs tested here cost about $2,600 on average, and even less whenyou include dealer discounts.andP;  That's roughly $6,000 less than the price ofthe original Compaq Deskpro 386/20 when it came out in September 1987, andit's about $2,000 less than the 20-MHz Dell System 310 cost at itsintroduction in April 1988.andM;These machines aren't trivial, either.andP;  We asked vendors to send us machinesequipped with 2MB of RAM, a 40MB hard disk, and a VGA display adapter andmonitor.andP;  Most of the computers come in large-format, AT-style cabinets, butothers, such as the Northgate MicroStation 386/20, have newer,small-footprint desktop configurations with fewer slots.andP;  While they're nottop-of-the-line PCs by any means, these machines deserve seriousconsideration from performance-minded users looking for low-cost, entry-levelmodels.andM;But what is it that makes 20-MHz 386 computers so inexpensive today?andP;  Why arethese machines up to $6,000 cheaper to produce now than they were a mere twoyears ago?andP;  And even more importantly, are these new computers in the sameclass as their older and more expensive brethen?andM;COMPETITION A FACTORandM;Competition has certainly made the prices of 386-based PCs go down during thepast two years.andP;  You can bet, for instance, that Dell's bold pricing of theoriginal System 310 brought the price of the equivalent Compaq or IBM systemdown.andP;  Similarly, more-aggressive vendors underpriced Dell and its peers, andtoday that same Dell System 310 cost $4,200 with a VGA monitor and 40MB harddisk.andP;  The Compaq Deskpro 386/20E, the small-footprint model that replacedthe original 386/20, costs $6,100 with built-in VGA.andM;That explains some of the price difference between the original Compaq andthese $2,600 machines.andP;  What explains more of the difference is thatimportant technical and marketing factors have created a class of commoditymachines based on 20-MHz 386 technology and assembled from standard, readilyavailable parts.andP;  You'll want to weight those factors carefully beforeconsidering a high-performance PC that costs as little as these twelve do.andM;To start with something fundamental as well as simple, the price of Intel's20-MHz 80386 processor has tumbled from $475 in 1987 to $201 now.andP;  In thatsame period, the &quot;glue&quot; chips required to merge processor, memory, and otherdiscrete components into a functioning PC system board have come down inprice by equally large proportions owing to increased production.andP;  That pricechange has affected Compaq's and IBM's pricing just as much as it hasaffected those of Amax Engineering Corp., C-Squared Microsystems, and othervendors whose machines are reviewed here, so there is no need for concern.andM;You should be concerned about the performance, construction quality, andservice that you'll get with these machines relative to more-expensivemodels.andP;  Performance is one area where PC Labs' benchmark tests will tell youexactly what to think.andP;  And 10 of these 12 machines suffer from the lack of amemory cache.andM;Intel's 20-MHz 386 technology introduced cached memory to the Pc industry.andO;While caching was nothing new to mainframes and minicomputers, Intel's 82385cache controller, combined with 32K of static RAM, brougth breathtakingperformance to the PCs that use it.andP;  A memory cache allows fast memory toserve as a buffer between a fast processor, such as the 20-MHz 386, andlower-speed memory, including 100-nanosecond or slower dynamic RAM chips.andM;By storing data likely to be needed or recently used by the processor inhigh-speed (expensive) SRAM, you can have a main system memory made up ofslower, less expensive DRAM.andP;  Without a processor RAM cache, wait states haveto be inserted into memory fetch and store cycles to allow the slower DRAMchips to keep up with processor requests.andM;KEEPING THE COST DOWNandM;Like any other performance enhancement, designing and building cachetechnology adds to the cost of a PC.andP;  Eliminating a memory cache is one wayto bring down the cost of building a 386-based PC, and ten of the vendorshere have done that, resulting in performance for those machines that isroughly 11 percent slower than that of the original Compaq Deskpro 386/20.andO;That's not terrible performance, and many higher-priced machines performabout the same.andP;  But you might want to consider the more-expensive machinesreviewed here, which offer memory caching and higher performance.andM;Quality is something that is immeasureable; you have to use a machines forsix months, a year, or even longer to determine just how long your machine isgoing to last.andP;  Our reviewers report on how well each machine seems to be puttogether, but remember that to keep costs down, the manufacturer simply hasto use less expensive and therefore lower-quality parts.andM;The key component among these parts is the system board, and vendors that akethese and other machines report a wide range of prices.andP;  They range fromabout $300 for a bare-bones, Taiwanese-manufactured board (designed to runwithout a memory cache) to about $1,300 for a domestically manufactured boardwith a memory cache and with the processor and memory installed.andP;  Installinga 386 processor and 2MB of RAM in the Taiwanese board brings its cost up toabout $1,000.andP;  These system boards include BIOS chips, and once you have theboard, all it takes to build one of these machines is to equip it withcomponents compatible with the BIOS.andM;The rest of the components, such as the video card and monitor, diskcontroller, floppy and hard disk drives, keyboard, power supply, and cabinet,also have a wide range of prices.andP;  While it seems that these vendors payabout the same as vendors of more-expensive machines, a small difference inthe price of these components can make a significant quality difference.andP;  A300-watt power supply, for example, doesn't cost substantially more than a200-watt model, but you may regret having a smaller one if you add apower-hungry expansion board someday.andM;A small price difference between floppy disk drives can indicate seriousdifferences in reliability.andP;  More important, however, is tha hard disk, andthe disks in these machines differ little in price, performance, and qualityfrom most others on the market.andP;  To prove it to yourself, just take a look atthe disk performance statistics for these machines compared with the originalCompaq Deskpro 386/20 used in PC Labs' benchmark tests.andP;  The drives all haveaccess times in the 26-to 32-millisecond range, and their DOS File Accessbenchmark test scores are quite competitive.andP;  On the other, hand, the videoperformances vary by quite a bit, reflecting the quality of the various VGAadapters used in the machines.andM;WHAT YOU REALLY GETandM;A larger question is what components will be in the machine you actually buy.andO;Assemblers of PCs like to buy these parts in large quantities and are alwayson the look-out for the best buys.andP;  So, while a machine tested for thisreview may have a VGA adapter from one vendor, the one you buy may have anadapter built by another.andP;  The one you get may be inferior or superior to theone tested here, and until you use it, you'll have no way of knowing.andM;The machines tested here are assembled both domestically and oversease.andP;  Themost difficult components to manufacture, system boards and disk drives, arepurchased by these vendors.andP;  The cost of final assembly is relatively small,with the actual place of assembly not being a major concern.andM;Service is also an area that is hard to measure, but every vendor we talkedto while preparing this story said that the biggest factor in holding down itcosts is low overhead.andP;  This includes advertising costs, manufacturingfacility costs, and employee benefits, but it also includes the quality ofthe manuals you get and the service you'll receive if you have trouble.andP;  Somemore-expensive machines come with 24-hour support accessible via 800 numbers,one-year on-site service, and other customer benefits that just can't bedelivered for $2,600.andP;  (Of course, not all expensive machines come with thesebenefits, either.)andM;Don't despair, though--there are some pleasant surprises here.andP;  Ourlowest-priced entry (tied with Tangent), from ACMA Computers, has thestringent FCC Class B rating as proof of its engineering, while the NorthgateMicroStation 386/20 comes with all the service and support that has madeNorthgate Computer Systems one of the leaders in the direct-mail market.andM;So read these reviews carefully and make sure the machine you select is goingto deliver the performance and quality you want.andP;  Then call the vendor toensure that you'll get the level of support you need.andM;In finding out what the 12 lowest-cost machines actually are, PC Magazinecontacted 97 computer vendors.andP;  To reflect the market accurately, we chosesix direct-marketing companies and six dealer-based vendors.andP;  Those companiesmarketing through dealers may offer addtiional discounts to the prices quotedhere, so consult the features table for each vendor's distribution method.andO;The reviews follow alphabetically, while the features table is arranged inascending price order.andM;CONSOLIDATING THE PC MARKET THE INTEL WAYandM;If Intel had its way, this story wouldn't get published.andP;  According to thecompany's plans for the 386 market, the current 16-MHz 80386SX and theup-and-coming 20-MHz 80386SX processors should be the bases for theentry-level 386 market, not these full-fledged 386/20s.andP;  But the market isn'tplaying it that way--at least not yet.andM;The 386SX processor offers 32-bit processing with 16-bit memory access andwas designed to take over for the older--and less capable--80286 processor.andO;Machines like those reviewed here, however, are priced so attractively thatit's hard to imagine why you'd be satisfied with the slower memoryperformance of an upgraded AT-class machine when you can have the real thingfor the same money or less.andP;  Even if you decide to spend $1,000 more than theprice of one of the machines reviewed here, you'll get better performance foryour money in the true 386 market.andM;But lower-priced SX machines are on deck and ready to come up to bat.andP;  Afterall, Intel's plans really require that you stop buying 286-based PCs;consequently, PC vendors have been responding to Intel's aggressive pricingand marketing moves by building SX-based machines that are becomingprice-competitive with 286s.andP;  Look for them here in PC Magazine next month.andO;Also, expect the number of choices to dwindle in the next year or two as the286, the 16-MHz 386, and other PC options are consolidated into a likelylineup of 20-MHz 386SX, 25- and 33-MHz 386s, and 486s.andM;PCs: Why They're Multiplying like RabbitsandM;You may have noticed that the number of vendors selling PCs has increaseddramatically over the past two years.andP;  Largely, this is because quality stockparts have become readily available.andM;Now that the number of first-source vendors selling these parts hasincreased, the clone market has exploded.andP;  Just about anyone can buy all thenecessary parts needed to assemble a competent computer these days.andP;  And justabout everyone does.andM;What does it take to build a 386?andP;  Here is a grocery list of components fromsome of the major manufacturers:andM;System boardandM;American Megatrends Inc.
