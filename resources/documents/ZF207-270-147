(products).andO;Product:   NeXTstep (Operating system) (usage).andO;Topic:     Program Development ToolsUser Ratings.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Sam WhitmoreandM;As developers begin exploring NeXTStep, NeXT Inc.'s new object-orientedprogramming environment, experts are predicting a rich world of softwareauthoring in which users effortlessly create programs precisely tailored totheir needs.andM;NeXTStep, which the company began shipping this month, offers intuitive easeof use and a comprehensive set of programming objects that will enable Cprograms to flow from even the most inexperienced programmers, the expertssaid.andM;''In addition to the objects NeXT has already provided, NeXT machine userswill create objects of their own that can be shared among themselves andincorporated into just about any kind of application, from basic coursewareto advanced research,'' said Jeff Burnett, vice president of marketing atStepstone Inc. of Sandy Hook, Conn.andP;  Stepstone created the Objective-Ccompiler NeXT licensed for the NeXTStep tool kit.andM;Before long, the industry may see roll-your-own NeXT applications proliferateas freely as Apple HyperCard stacks, according to Stephen Wolfram, presidentof Wolfram Research Inc. of Champaign, Ill., another developer under contractto NeXT.andM;''It would be a pity if the market became flooded with pretty applicationsthat didn't do much,'' Wolfram said, ''but [NeXTStep] is so powerful thateven the lowest-common-denominator applications will be fairly impressive.''andM;NeXTStep itself consists of four components:andM;Workspace Manager, the screen area in which developers manipulate NeXTStep'sobject-oriented icons and create their applications;andM;Window Server, underlying software that relays commands from a keyboard ormouse to the applications running in windows on the screen;andM;Application Kit, which comprises two dozen ''building-block'' objects, suchas windows, scroll bars and buttons, that programmers can link together tocreate fully functional C applications; andandM;Interface Builder, a tool kit enabling programmers to build custom graphicaluser interfaces for each NeXT application.andM;The NeXTStep tool kit works atop Mach, NeXT's own operating system thatmirrors the functions of Berkeley 4.3 Unix.andM;NeXT officials say the NeXTStep product shipped this month is stillofficially beta code; release 1.0 of the software will arrive by spring.andP;  Asa result, some developers say it's too early to tell whether NeXT's toolshave lived up to their billing.andM;Others already have formed their opinion about NeXTStep.andP;  ''While the codeisn't 100 percent stable yet, it's quite a nice environment,'' said GregCockroft, senior software engineer at Frame Technology in Dexter, Mich.andO;Frame has adapted its Framemaker desktop-publishing package for use on theNeXT PC.andM;NeXTStep's ease of use helps experts as well as novices, Cockroft said.andP;  Hepraised NeXTStep's Interface Builder for easily allowing him to port C-basedUnix applications originally written for Sun Microsystems Inc. workstationsover to the NeXT environment.andP;  Programmers can lift menus, scroll bars andother discrete elements from a Unix program using NeXTStep, he explained, andtranslate those objects into C code, which then can be translated toObjective-C code compatible with NeXTStep.andP;  Then the symbols can bereincorporated into a NeXTStep application.andM;At this point, NeXT machines are available only to developers, mostly inuniversities.andP;  As more machines arrive, however, developers predict that thecustomized programming now available to higher education will creep intocorporate America as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
