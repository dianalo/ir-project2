One hundred US and CT images of prostaticdiseases collected from 10 medical institutions, including 33 cases ofprostatic cancer, 29 of benign prostatic hypertrophy, 7 of prostatitis,2 of prostatic stone and 29 of normal finding, were read by 21 urologists.As the results, US was found to be more useful than CT for both the detectionof prostatic diseases and the differentiation between prostatic cancerand benign prostatic hypertrophy. The sensitivity of US for the diagnosisof prostatic cancer was 64.2 % on average of all the urologists. However,the sensitivity was 80.0 % on average of 5 urologists who have read morethan 3,000 US images and 59.5 % on average of 16 doctors who have readwithin 3,000 US images.</TEXT></DOC>
