John Hull, who was out on $37,500 bond on charges he violatedCosta Rican neutrality and trafficked in cocaine, said he slippedaway about a week ago.   The drug counts were dropped Wednesday by a judge, but theneutrality charges remain.   In the United States, the 69-year-old rancher faces a subpoenaby a Senate subcommittee looking into similar charges, as well as aJustice Department investigation into an allegation he fraudulentlyobtained a $375,000 U.S. development loan.   Hull vehemently denied all the accusations Wednesday in aninterview with The Associated Press, saying the charges against himwere really charges against the U.S. government.   ``The Costa Ricans are accusing the United States government,the CIA, the past president and the current president of being drugtraffickers,'' he said.   The former Evansville, Ind., resident, who has lived in CostaRica for 20 years, said he was just a ``patriotic American'' whogave humanitarian aid to the Contras seeking to overthrowNicaragua's Sandinista government.   He said the accusations had been pushed by communists and ``drugpeople.''   U.S. prosecutors say they have no evidence to support the drugcharges, but insist Hull was more active than he admits in helpingformer National Security Council aide Oliver North aid the Contraseven after Congress cut off funding.   A chart prepared by then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Feldmanof Miami in 1986 put Hull directly under North and North's aide,Robert Owen.   Hull acknowledges receiving about $10,000 a month from Contraleader Adolfo Calero to feed and supply the rebels, but deniesknowing the money was provided on North's orders.   Hull also denied working for the National Security Council,saying Owen was simply an ``old friend'' he knew through the officeof then-Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.   However, he said he had frequent contact with CIA agents.   ``Constantly there were CIA people passing through the zone,''he said. ``They would visit my house, they would ask questionsabout locations of farms ... it was obvious they were wantinginformation about air drops and so forth.   ``The same as any patriotic American would do, I cooperated withthe agencies of my government,'' Hull said.   Hull was most angry about testimony before a drug subcommitteeheaded by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., that airstrips on his ranchwere used as refueling and transfer stations by pilots bringing inguns for the Contras and taking cocaine and marijuana back to theUnited States.   Convicted drug traffickers Jorge Morales and Gary Betznertestified that they used Hull's ranch for cocaine flights. Otherwitnesses, including former Panamanian official Jose Blandon, saidthey knew of drugs passing through Hull's ranch.   Hull said Wednesday that Morales and Betzner's testimony wasjust an attempt to win lighter sentences.   Kerry counsel Jonathan Winer said the subcommittee wanted totalk to Hull as soon as possible.   ``Hull is under subpoena and has been for a year, and we willseek to serve him,'' Winer said. ``We've sought to serve himbefore, but he has been in Costa Rica, and, from our point of view,evading the subpoena.''   Hull said he was willing to talk. However, he has accused Kerryof being a communist, and, according to the subcommittee, at onepoint tried to stall the panel's investigation by filing a flood offalse affidavits with the Justice Department.   Hull may also have to talk to the Justice Department aboutalleged fraud involving a 1983 loan from the U.S. Overseas PrivateInvestment Corp.   Hull blamed the agency, rather than himself, for any confusionover the $375,000 loan, and insisted it has been paid back.   Hull, saying he suffers from a heart condition and diabetes,said he mainly returned to the United States to seek medicaltreatment. He said he has no money, and intends to return toIndiana until he is treated.   ``Then I want to return to Costa Rica,'' he said. ``I have faithin the Costa Rican judicial system.''</TEXT></DOC>
