Higher tritium contentwas frequently observed, and this was explained by the presence of remoteand local sources. In order to determine the influence of local sources,tritium distribution in the vicinity of neutron generators was also measured.The specific activity of the tritium in the ground layer of atmosphericmoisture, in the absence of local sources, is about 10 Bk/kg. The activityof the abundant tritium along the 'tritium plume' was of the same orderof magnitude, and was decreasing to 1 Bq/kg at 1 km. Reasonable agreementbetween measured and theoretically calculated values was obtained byappropriate chice of diffusion parameters depending on the meteorologicalconditions. The results show that moisture ansport studies using tritiummust take into account the tritium of technical genesis; disturbanciesby local sources can be eliminated by appropriate choice of the locationof sampling.</TEXT></DOC>
