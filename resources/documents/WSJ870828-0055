The most senior change was the appointment of Don Mazankowski to treasury board president. Mr. Mazankowski, one of the most senior cabinet ministers, retains his current positions as deputy prime minister and privy council president.    Prime Minister Mulroney said that giving Mr. Mazankowski the additional portfolio would &quot;consolidate responsibility for the smooth functioning of the government.&quot;    The changes come at a time when the government is placed last in recent public opinion polls measuring political popularity. The mandate of the Progressive Conservative Party expires in 1989, but it is expected that the prime minister will call an election before then.    Some political observers said the changes, announced late yesterday, may have been timed to deflect attention from a scheduled appearance of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau before a parliamentary committee.    As treasury board president, Mr. Mazankowski succeeds Robert de Cotret, who was named minister of the new department of industry, science and technology. </TEXT></DOC>
