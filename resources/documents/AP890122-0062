Internal reviews by the district attorney's office and policedepartment were prompted in part by a work-release prisoner'scomplaint that two investigators threatened to hang him, shoot himor have him raped by other prisoners for refusing to implicate aguard in an alleged February 1988 beating, The Philadelphia Inquirerreported.   The corruption probe, Operation Ferret, has resulted in criminalcharges against 58 prison employees.   The newspaper quoted an unidentified police official as sayingthe department is investigating a police detective in connectionwith his work on Operation Ferret, but declined to give details.   Operation Ferret is a two-year inquiry that District AttorneyRonald D. Castille said last year would eventually result in atleast 100 arrests.   Through spokesman Terry Williamson, Castille declined to comment.Williamson said office policy prohibits public comment on anypending investigation or confirmation of its existence.   The prisoner who complained of the threats, Brian C. Kauffman,27, told the Inquirer a member of Castille's staff questioned himlast week about his allegations.   Last May, according to prison records, Kauffman told a socialworker and a corrections sergeant, who wrote memos about hiscomplaints to their supervisors, that two investigators hadhandcuffed him to a chair and accused him of lying to them about thealleged February 1988 beating of prisoner William J. Kennedy.   That beating led to the first wave of arrests last March. Sevenguards were accused of beating Kennedy at a work-release residenceor lying to conceal the incident. Charges against those guards havebeen dropped or thrown out.   Kauffman, serving a 3{-to-seven-year sentence for theft bydeception told authorities last February that he saw no misconductby guards on the night of Kennedy's alleged beating.   Social worker Janet Grossman and Corrections Sgt. Edward Noblewrote in memos obtained by the Inquirer that Kauffman said he wastaken to the city prisons' internal affairs building and threatenedrepeatedly by two investigators whom he could not identify.   According to the memo, Kauffman said the two men warned him: ``Ifyou don't say what we want, we are going to hang you from the neckhere in the back room.''   Former Deputy District Attorney Odell Guyton, who initiatedOperation Ferret and supervised it until December, said he hadreceived Ms. Grossman's memo, but would not say what he had done inresponse.</TEXT></DOC>
