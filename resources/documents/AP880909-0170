The New York area employees returned to work under court orderhours after the strike began, and officials said train service wasnear-normal during the evening rush hour. Legislation to force theChicago workers to do the same thing passed in Congress on Fridayafternoon, but it was too late to get commuter trains rolling ontime from Chicago.   The strike by 780 track workers in New York's Metro-NorthCommuter Railroad was prompted by the suspension of 37 employeesTuesday for refusing to work overtime, the Teamsters said. Theunion contends that forcing tired workers to continue on the jobcould be dangerous.   Other unions quickly honored the Teamsters' picket lines,shutting down the line and catching morning commuters inConnecticut and New York northern suburbs without warning.   ``The train problem today is a surprise to me,'' said Jim Grantat the South Norwalk, Conn., train station. ``I wasn't evenlistening to radio or TV.'' He said he would drive to a town thathas bus service to New York.   Friday evening, Metro-North operated about a third fewer trainsout of Grand Central Terminal because much of the commuter line'sequipment was left at the northern part of the system by thestrike, said spokesman Dan Brucker.   In Chicago, 2,600 United Transportation Union workers struck theChicago andamp; North Western railway at 9 a.m. CDT when the railroad'sparent company began posting layoff notices eliminating 1,150brakemen's jobs.   The strike could have begun just after midnight, when afederally mandated cooling-off period expired. But the company andunion had agreed to hold off the actions until after the heaviestpart of the morning rush hour.   The delay assured some 41,000 commuters in the north,northwestern and western suburbs a ride to work, but many commuterssought alternate methods of getting to work and ridership was downabout 40 percent.   ``This is terrible. I think it very unfair and just, plainstupid,'' said Marge Miller of Chicago. ``You just can't believesomething like this can happen.''   A bill imposing a compromise settlement in the dispute wasapproved by the Senate on Thursday. The bill, which would trim thenumber of brakemen's jobs by 689, then passed the House on Fridayafternoon. Reagan signed the bill early Friday evening.   The first train pulled out of the company's downtown terminalafter 5 p.m. CDT. But railroad spokeswoman Robin Bourne-Caris saidthe company was having difficulty finding full work crews, addingto the delays.   ``Some of the union people left today and not all have come backeven though many of the pickets are down,'' she said.   ``Most of our people were docked pay'' during a brief strike onAug. 4, the day the cooling-off period was imposed, said DavidWells, a brakeman. ``We informed our commuters that we didn'tanticipate there would be an evening rush hour.''   In New York, the strike was halted after U.S. District JudgeInzer Wyatt ordered the Teamsters back to work.   ``We are going back because we felt we got the point across,''said John Mahoney, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 808. ``Wehad the attention. There's a lot of people involved, a lot ofpoliticians involved now. ... The commuters are screaming.''   The judge set a hearing Monday afternoon on whether to issue apermanent injunction and whether to award damages. The railroad,contending the strike was illegal, sought $1 million in damages andalso vowed disciplinary action against the strikers.   The House vote imposing the settlement in Chicago almost did nottake place Friday.   Under House rules, members must unanimously agree before a billcan be brought to the floor without a waiting period. One Chicagocongressman with close ties to labor briefly blocked that quickaction, raising fears that the Chicago-area strike could havedragged on until at least Wednesday. But he later withdrew hisobjection.   Congress and the president have authority under the RailwayLabor Act to to settle railroad disputes that threaten nationalcommerce.   The dispute stems from the railroad's effort to reduce the sizeof freight crews by eliminating two brakemen per train, sayingthose jobs are obsolete. The union contends that to eliminate thoseworkers would compromise safety.   The strike also halted Candamp;NW's 10-state freight operation, butthe company was prepared to resume those runs with managementpersonnel, said Candamp;NW spokeswoman Leslie Cleveland.</TEXT></DOC>
