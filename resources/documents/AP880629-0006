The drought that has for weeks dried most of the nation'smidsection and some of the Southeast has affected more than justcrops. Animals are being forced from the woods to populated areasin search of food and water.   Vice President George Bush visited a livestock auction inMarion, Wis., and Michael Dukakis went to Iowa on Wednesday, as thehead of a non-profit farmers' organization accused politicians andthe news media of taking advantage of the trouble.   ``We do want to help,'' Bush told about 200 people at theauction during a recess in bidding. ``I dont want toover-promise.'' Dukakis, the Democratic nominee-to-be, got afirsthand look at a relatively healthy corn field but stressed``the importance of pulling together'' to help farmers.   The National Weather Service Long Range Predictions Groupreleased a 30-day forecast Wednesday that called for below-normalrainfall during July for Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,Kentucky and most of California.   But above-normal rainfall was predicted for some drought-plaguedareas, including Montana, Wyoming, southern South Dakota, Nebraska,Kansas, New Mexico and western portions of Iowa, Missouri, Oklahomaand Texas.   ``We went out and sat in it,'' said Wendy Hooyboer, a farmer inFort Calhoun, Neb., which got an inch and a half of rain overnight.``When you're looking at your corn curling, that's what you want todo. It's a nice, slow, blessed rain.''   In Waterloo, Iowa, the third annual Farm Progress Hay Expo, ashow of farm equipment and techniques, was postponed a day toThursday after three-quarters of an inch of rain fell in the area.   ``You can't bale the hay when it gets too wet and too heavy. Andit won't keep, it will spoil,'' said Frank Holdmeyer, managingeditor of Wallaces Farmer magazine, sponsor of the event.   ``I think most everybody is grateful for the rain and aren't tooconcerned about the hay expo,'' Holdmeyer said. ``It'd be kind ofnice to have the rain tomorrow, too, even if it means canceling theexpo.''   ``This isn't a drought-breaker, but the most hopeful developmentfor rain this month,'' weather service meteorologist John Pollacksaid of Nebraska's rainfall, which brought up to 3 inches of rainto eastern parts of the state.   While the storms rolled in much-needed moisture to Oklahoma,forecaster Ken Huckabee said some areas may get no relief at allbecause of the hit-or-miss pattern of the weather system.   ``We had people who lived here in Norman got less than a halfinch of rain, whereas the northern half of Oklahoma City had over 4inches reported,'' said Huckabee.   ``We're still facing our hottest month of the year _ July,''cautioned meterologist Ted Stimach in Madison, Wis., where farmerswho hadn't seen rain for eight weeks rejoiced when more than aninch of rain fell.   Animals are feeling drought, too.   Turtles at a University of Michigan reserve near Pickney arehaving trouble nesting in the baked earth.   ``If we don't get some rain in the next two or three weeks,we're not going to have any baby turtles this year,'' said JustinCongdon, who for 14 years has studied the 6,000 painted, snappingand Blanding's turtles that live on the 1,400-acre Edwin S. GeorgeReserve.   Kentucky farmers have found their crops invaded by deer who havebeen forced from the woods in search of food and water.   ``They head for soybeans, which they prefer over corn. But ifsoybeans aren't available, they'll settle for corn,'' said JohnPhillips, a deer specialist with the Kentucky Division of Wildlife.``None of them are starving but they are running out of naturalvegetation.''   Cattlemen in southeast North Dakota have moved their herds togreener pastures in northwest Minnesota to escape the drought.   ``I don't know what the weight gains will be, but we're hopingto keep them alive at least,'' said McLeod rancher Larry Woodbury,president of the Sheyenne Valley Grazing Association, who said hehad moved more than half of his 240 cattle.   In other developments:   _The president of the American Farm Bureau accused the media andpoliticians of exaggerating the severity of the drought.   ``The national media never met a disaster they didn't like, andthey're playing it for all it's worth,'' Dean Kleckner said Tuesdayat a news conference at Colorado State University. Politicians arehoping to take advantage of the drought crisis in an election year,he claimed.   _The Agriculture Department said prices paid to farmers forgrain and other raw products rose 3.7 percent in June as droughtand searing heat reduced 1988 harvest prospects over much of thenation.   _Trucks were expected to arrive late Wednesday in CharlotteCourt House, Va., to be loaded with hay to send to drought-strickenfarmers in Akron, Ohio. Charlotte County farmers planned to truck2,000 bales of hay to farmers who had sent hay to Virginia twoyears ago. The trucks were expected to leave Friday and arrive inOhio's Mercer County on Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
