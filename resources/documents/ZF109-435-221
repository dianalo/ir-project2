Brown, chief of OMB's Financial Systems and Policy Branch, said thecomprehensive reviews will supplement OMB's annual examination of agencyfive-year plans for financial systems.andP;  Brown said OMB will work withTreasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) to review upgrade efforts infive agencies: the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Treasury andVeterans Affairs and the Internal Revenue Service.andM;These agencies were selected because of the size and scope of their financialsystems and their interest in the new program.andP;  The reviews will ensure theagencies are developing effective plans and have enough money in their 1992budgets to accomplish their goals, Brown said.andM;&quot;We want to do a case-by-case review and offer suggestions on how plans canbe improved.andP;  The most important thing is to get the reviews done in time soour conclusions can be figured into the budget process,&quot; Brown said.andP;  &quot;Thesearen't inspections or audits.andP;  We want to get a thorough understanding of theplans so we can be advocates.&quot;andM;Review TeamsandM;Under the comprehensive review format, OMB and FMS staff members will serveon review teams with a representative from the agency inspector general'soffice and a volunteer from another agency.andP;  The reviews will be done on siteand the teams will match up the agency's five-year plan with the requirementsfor major systems projects.andM;For example, the teams will check to see if hardware requirements are in linewith software development cycles, and whether the plans allow enough time forconversion and testing.andM;&quot;We want to look at them in depth and generate ideas that can improve theplans.andP;  But the main thing is to be sure that the plans are ready, feasibleand practical,&quot; Brown said.andM;OMB's new oversight program comes as Congress and the General AccountingOffice have called for agencies to spell out exactly how they plan to improvefinancial systems and how much it will cost.andM;Under the Reagan administration's Reform '88 program, agencies were supposedto have finished upgrading their financial systems two years ago.andP;  But nowOMB officials acknowledge that the upgrades will require more coordinationand more money.andM;Brown said the reviews should produce lessons that all agencies can use.andO;However, no decision has been made on whether the comprehensive reviews willbecome a regular program, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
