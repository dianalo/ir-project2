He was greeted by amarching band and about 200 invited guests, including Gov. JoeFrank Harris, Mayor Maynard Jackson and Coretta Scott King, widowof the slain civil rights leader.   About 100 people lined an access road nearby, hoping for aglimpse of Mandela, who came from Washington. Security was heavy.   Mandela quickly reminded Atlanta's civil rights leaders, some ofwhom have gently criticized him for not renouncing violence, thathe sees South Africa's black movement as different from the U.S.civil rights struggle.   ``Unlike you, we are still under the grip of white supremacy,''he said in a brief address at the airport.   Mandela then spoke briefly to reporters, saying, ``Non-violenceis a good policy when conditions permit.''   Mandela was scheduled to lay a wreath at King's tomb and then toaddress an audience of civil rights activists at Big Bethel AMEChurch. A later address at Morehouse College was canceled, butMandela still planned to address a sold-out rally at Grant Field.   Mandela's schedule has been trimmed down to give the 71-year-oldleader more rest. He has been touring the United States since June20.   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the King-founded SouthernChristian Leadership Conference, hoped Mandela's visit wouldinspire black Americans to ``see that we can overcome.''   ``We think we have problems. He's overcome and I hope he lightsour fire,'' Lowery said.   In turn, some civil rights figures hoped a first-hand look atracial progress in the South would lead Mandela to try to avoidviolence in his homeland.   Others, including King's widow said more attention is paid toMandela's stance on violence than to the South African government'sviolence toward blacks.   As chairman of the Mandela visit host committee, Mrs. King saidshe hoped to show the African National Congress leader Atlanta's``impressive spirit of interracial cooperation.''   Civil rights leaders who worked with King during the 1960sacknowledged that King's staunch policy of non-violence conflictswith Mandela's stand, but they are sympathetic to the blacknationalist leader.   In general, they say it is more important to free South Africanblacks than to insist on doing it their way.   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a civil rights veteran who has beenjailed 40 times, said: ``Without violence, we were able to turn theSouth into a New South. Maybe being there will give him the will totry, as much as possible, to avert violence.''   ``If our experiences in desegregation can be helpful, we willoffer them, Lowery said.   ``There are some differences in every revolution, but I have toadvocate non-violence. I've seen the results,'' said the Rev. HoseaWilliams, King's field lieutenant during the 1960s.   ``I would tell Mr. Mandela to please study and evaluate theteachings of Martin Luther King Jr. before deciding that violenceis the only way to bring about needed social change.''</TEXT></DOC>
