An eager volunteer,one of 17 blacks in a class of 18, walks to the blackboardbeneath the U.S. flag in a scene familiar to anyone -- untilthe chalk moves.   Instead of the numeral 2, the girl draws two lotusflowers, followed by four coiled ropes, two oxen yokes, andseven vertical strokes.   &quot;Very good, Jeannette,&quot; says Mrs. Smith, praising aperfect rendition of 2,427 in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.&quot;You can take your seat.&quot;   Mrs. Smith's arithmetic lesson is part of a newAfrica-centered curriculum that is fast spreading in urbanschools. Atlanta, Baltimore, Detroit, Indianapolis, Portland,Ore., and Washington, D.C., are in various stages of similarcourse-content changes that stress, to a high degree, thehistory and culture of black people.   This approach, sometimes called &quot;Afrocentric,&quot; claims thattypical school textbooks have played down or outright ignoredblack scholars, writers and mathematicians. One of a set ofessays used in Afrocentrist curricula sees &quot;the vision of theAfrican people as being the wellspring of creativity andknowledge on which the foundation of all science, technologyand engineering rests, and draws continuing inspiration.&quot;   Many prominent scholars say the claims of theAfrocentrists are grossly inaccurate, as well as raciallyinflammatory. According to the Afrocentric essays, forexample, Cleopatra was black and the rich culture of ancientEgypt was largely African. That's why Mrs. Smith's studentslearn hieroglyphics.   But to say that Cleopatra was a black &quot;is baloney,&quot; saysFrank Yurco, an expert on ancient Egypt at Chicago's FieldMuseum, who says the record of her Greek and Macedonianlineage is well established. Mr. Yurco adds that to suggest,as the teaching guides do, &quot;that Egypt derived from CentralAfrica is a major distortion.&quot;   Still, in Atlanta, the first black majority district tointroduce an African-oriented curriculum in all its schools,there is mounting evidence of educational gains.   Many principals and teachers say students are taking moreinterest in school and raising their aspirations since theAfrican Infusion Project started. In 17 schools that piloted&quot;infusion&quot; in the 1989-90 school year, the percentage ofstudents scoring at or above norms on standardized readingand math tests rose by a higher rate than in the system as awhole. Average attendance at the 17 schools rose by about apercentage point to 91.5%, catching up with the overalldistrict rate after trailing it in 1988-89.   &quot;We have seen positive results,&quot; says Eunice Robinson, theprincipal of Cleveland Avenue, where students at or abovereading norms shot up to 64% of enrollment in the spring of1990, from 50%. Sherman Lofton, principal of Brown HighSchool in one of Atlanta's poorer black neighborhoods, adds:&quot;It really helps kids with their self-esteem. We've got moresaying they want to go to college and training school.&quot;   Curriculum change is one of many new efforts aimed atimproving the education of black children, especially in theinner cities, where traditional methods don't seem to beworking. In the 37 years since the Supreme Court struck downsegregated schools, blacks have narrowed the educational gapwith whites, but still lag badly in college-admissions andother test scores, graduation and college-going rates.   Proposed remedies are becoming more radical. Some blacksfavor vouchers they could use at private schools. Milwaukee,New York and Detroit have considered schools exclusively forblack boys that would concentrate on providing role modelsand other help. Ironically, they must overcome the legallegacy of the desegregation decision to get them started.   Proponents of Afrocentrism say it offers something for allschools. In Portland, Ore., the first major system to endorseincreased African input, 74% of students are white. Theschool board there plans to add American Indian, Hispanic andAsian course plans to the African-American Baseline Essays,or teaching guides, that already have been developed.   Atlanta and other cities with African approaches haven'tfocused on curricula tailored to other minorities. They aremerely trying to more effectively address large blackmajorities.   The mere notion, though, that any school would tailor itscurriculum to an ethnic group draws many critics. DianeRavitch, an educational historian and the new White Housenominee to head research at the Department of Education, saysmuch of what is being done under the Afrocentric banner is&quot;teaching racial antagonism.&quot; What's more, she says, &quot;To sayyou're going to make another continent the center of yourcurriculum, and center science, math and English around thiscontinent, is pedagogically unsound.&quot;   Rising test scores don't make her feel any better aboutit. &quot;White southerners used to say to me, `We get the besttest scores in segregated schools. Why integrate?'&quot; sheobserves. &quot;If we discovered that apartheid produced highertest scores, would that make apartheid a good system?&quot;   But Asa Hilliard, a Georgia State University professor andconsultant on Africa-oriented learning, says, &quot;There is amassive amount of validated non-trivial data about Africathat is missing from schools, data without which the generalevents in many areas of content can't be understood. I simplyadvocate that the record be researched and the most truthfulpicture possible be given in the curriculum. I don't thinkthat can be done without including African and black peoplein every subject.&quot;   In many ways, the Atlanta public schools are an idealcrucible for the Afrocentric approach. Enrollment, now about59,600, has been declining for years, first because of whiteflight from desegregation and more recently because of a lowopinion by the public, both white and black, of schoolquality. The system is as Afro-American as they come: 92% ofstudents and 93% of staff are black. Test scores,college-enrollment and dropout rates are consistently amongthe worst in Georgia. Alarmed, business and school leadershave launched studies of the problem. Afrocentrism emergedfrom one of them.   Teachers participating in the Afrocentric curriculum inAtlanta insist they are getting across the traditionalinformation all students need. In Mrs. Smith's class atCleveland Avenue, each drill in hieroglyphics also conveyssomething about addition. When a student writes 214 as KingTut did, for example, her classmates recite together, &quot;200plus 10 plus four.&quot;   Similarly, in an African geography lesson at Sutton MiddleSchool, students demonstrate knowledge that might be usefulin a broader sphere. &quot;What's a word for a high, flat landmass?&quot; asks Virginia Stanley, a sixth-grade teacher.&quot;Plateau,&quot; says one of many students with hands up.Classmates quickly define arid tracts as deserts, find theStrait of Gibraltar on a world map, and relate how sleepinessinduced by the bite of tse-tse fly kills both cattle andpeople. Ms. Stanley's students, about a third of whom arewhite, later get a lesson about a Medieval pilgrimage toMecca by Mansa Mussa, king of Mali.   In teaching from a black perspective, though, the Atlantaschools do cover material many white adults don't know. Theyalso prompt black students to consider racial questions theymight not otherwise ponder. When world history teacher JillBeracki guides her tenth-grade class at Frederick DouglassHigh School through the Industrial Revolution, familiarthemes are explored. But the tour also goes by way of Africawith a major stopover in the African diaspora.   Mrs. Beracki wants to know &quot;why Britain led the way&quot; inindustrialization, and her students respond. &quot;Skilled laborforce,&quot; says one. Government policies and naval prowess arediscussed. Then discussion turns to sources of raw materialsin British colonies and other matters. When, 10 minutes intothe period, Mrs. Beracki asks what role blacks played in theIndustrial Revolution, her students say it can't be found inthe textbook.   &quot;This book is written from a European point-of-view,&quot; saysstudent Emanuel Easter matter-of-factly. &quot;It doesn't reallyfocus on black Americans.&quot; Classmate Tommy Phillips agrees.Europe, he says, gets &quot;two whole chapters&quot; in this unit.&quot;Africa, Asia and the whole rest of the world is just onelittle section.&quot;   &quot;For some reason,&quot; Mrs. Beracki tells the class, &quot;blackAmericans have been omitted from the history ofindustrialization. As a compensation, I've asked you to dosome reports on black inventors.&quot; There is no lack of raisedhands when Mrs. Beracki asks for someone to start.   Emanuel tells of Garrett Morgan, a Clevelander who createdthe first traffic light and gas mask. Makila Sands did herreport on Elijah McCoy, possibly the namesake for the &quot;realMcCoy,&quot; she says, because his automatic machine lubricatorwas much copied but never replicated. A somewhatself-conscious student gets up and turns to face the class.&quot;I want to tell you about James Matzeliger,&quot; he says with anervous stutter. &quot;He was born in Lynn, Mass., in 1852. . . .He made Lynn the shoe capital of the world. . . . Theycouldn't make a machine to sew soles to last. People said itwas impossible to make such a machine.&quot;   But James Matzeliger, a black man, did it.   Much research shows that students do better when schoolsinvolve parents and the community in education. One of thegoals of the Afro-based curriculum is to improve thisinvolvement in Atlanta, where the black community is the mainone served by public schools.   One bright chilly morning, 17 community volunteers gatherin the library of Cleveland Avenue Elementary, makingpreparations for a day of African storytelling and readingsof black American poetry. Some wear the colorful native garbof Nigeria, but others sport a more conventional businesslook. That's more important than middle-class people mightknow, says Eunice Robinson, the principal.   &quot;We have children who don't usually see black males insuits and ties,&quot; she says. &quot;This give them a chance to seethat black males don't all shoot dope. These kids can tellyou what the dope dealer wears, and what he drives, but theycan't tell you how a black businessman is supposed to look.&quot;   Dispersing to the classrooms, the volunteers read aloudtales such as &quot;Why Mosquitoes Buzz in Peoples' Ears&quot; and &quot;Howthe Rabbit Lost His Tail.&quot; Brieu Madison, a local collegestudent, dons a housedress and head scarf to play a sarcasticmother, rousing a lazy child from sleep in the Paul LaurenceDunbar poem &quot;In the Morning.&quot; Avid fifth-graders come forwardto act alongside her, and a tangle of hands shoots up whenMs. Madison asks for comment on a Langston Hughes poem.   After applauding, several students wonder aloud what itmight be like to be an actor. Nse Ufot, a fifth grade fan,pens an acrostic to Ms. Madison, using her first name:&quot;Brilliant, Radiant . . . Important . . . Enthusiastic,Unbeatable.&quot;   Infusion has altered what goes on in many Atlantaclassrooms, but as with any major curricular change,implementation has been spotty. In the 1989-1990 school year,17 pilot schools were supposed to redesign their curriculumat every grade, while five others were picked to introducethe program in selected classes. For the year just ended, theentire system was supposed to be &quot;infusing&quot; at every gradelevel in every subject, but the district admits that outsideof math and social studies, implementation has been spotty.   Afrocentrism isn't merely changing content, but methods aswell. In subjects like history and English, black and Africancontributions can be included without much altering the waysubject matter is covered. It's merely a matter of changingsome of the people and literature studied.   But in science and math, the fit is more difficult. AtCleveland Avenue, Mrs. Smith's students learn Egyptiannumerals before Roman numerals. The system also wantsteachers to personalize math and science. Geometry istraditionally covered with only a passing reference to Euclidand Pythagoras; but Atlanta wants black mathematicians andtheir contributions not only to be mentioned, but to serve asa pivot for lessons.   In a fifth-grade class, teacher Loretta Palmer readies aspecial lesson. &quot;We're going to take a lesson in math andsocial studies together,&quot; she announces. &quot;Our lesson is goingto be about time, with someone who was very concerned withtime&quot; -- Benjamin Banneker, mathematician and maker of thefirst clock in colonial America.   At any opportunity, Mrs. Palmer strives to include a blackmessage. When subtraction exercises concern a boy who isalways late, she tells her children &quot;Benjamin Banneker lovedto be on time.&quot; With the objective of the day -- &quot;Solve aproblem involving time&quot; -- on the blackboard, she tells theclass, &quot;That's part of your great heritage, to be there ontime.&quot;   After class, Mrs. Robinson, the principal, asks thechildren to talk about their black and African-Americanheroes and knowledge. Adrian, an irrepressible contributor,says his hero is &quot;King Tut -- he was king of Africa.&quot;   Turning phrases like a practiced orator, young DaronWalters says what he knows: &quot;Africa has been going on formillions and millions of years. I know this because ofstories I have read. I have learned about great men who ruled1,363 years before Christ, and seen masks that men madebefore Christ was born.&quot; When asked who some of thesepre-Christian kings were, he mentions &quot;Shaka Zulu.&quot; It is anerror. Shaka was indeed a Zulu king, but of the 19th centuryA.D.   Returning to her office, Mrs. Robinson is beaming withpride, but feeling somewhat apologetic. &quot;When you hear mychildren, you hear wrong answers,&quot; says Mrs. Robinson. &quot;Ihear answers where there were no answers before.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
