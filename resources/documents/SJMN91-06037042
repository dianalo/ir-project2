Mayors in Sunnyvale are chosen by council members from their own ranks,for two-year terms, a practice Stone says involves &quot;back-room bargaining,pressure and arm twisting.&quot;;    Stone's petition aims at placing a charteramendment establishing the position on the November ballot. The post would befilled in a special election next June. The mayor elected then would serveuntil November of 1993, when the first four-year mayor would be elected.;   People circulating the petition must gather 9,000 signatures of registeredvoters (15 percent) and the ballot measure must be submitted to the countyRegistrar of Voters by Aug. 9 to get it on the November ballot.;    The papersfiled by Stone specify that the duties and authority of the elected mayorwould be the same as those of the appointed mayor. Terms of council memberswould remain unchanged by the charter amendment, although it would increase a$25 penalty for missing a meeting to $150. Council members earn about $800 amonth, the mayor a little more.;    Stone tried in October to get the councilto put a directly elected mayor measure on the Jan. 22 election ballot, atwhich voters filled a vacant seat. The council instead chose to put the matteron the agenda for its legislative workshop last December, where it was placedon the 1991 legislative calendar -- a list of matters the council wants toconsider during the year -- and a staff report was delivered last week.;   Tuesday night, the city council authorized a committee to prepare a charteramendment dealing with direct election of the mayor. If such an amendmentemerges, it would be placed on the November ballot.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LELAND JOACHIM, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910206  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  348  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 6, 199100037042,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
