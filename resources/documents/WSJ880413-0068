Many investors were awaiting the expected meeting Wednesday of the Group of Seven big industrial nations on foreign exchange matters.    In Tokyo, a late round of buying of bluechip electrical issues helped the market recoup most of its earlier losses.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues rose a slim 5.97 points to close at a record 26930.84. Volume on the first section was estimated at a moderate 750 million shares, down from 900 million shares Monday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 1.56 to 2182.02.    In early trading Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose almost 20 points to 26950.11.    Traders said many investors, and in particular major brokerages, were encouraged by the dollar's stability in Asian trading, and decided to bet that the blue-chip electricals would continue to benefit from dollar stability.    Traders said some market participants were also connecting the move in electricals to renewed speculation that a fire said to have damaged a South Korean audio and videocassette tape plant will reduce supplies of such tape.    Advances for such issues as Sony and TDK were seen as stemming from the South Korean fire story, although Hitachi Maxell was little changed, traders said.    One trader said the rally for electricals was prompted by brokerages and institutional investors, who &quot;decided to take a bet on the dollar.&quot;    Electricals posting sharp gains included Sony, up 170 yen to 5,650 yen ($44.70), and TDK, up 270 at 4,800. Both firms are major makers of video and audio tape.    Traders also noted that electricals have surged ahead of each of the past two U.S. monthly trade reports.    &quot;The electricals have kicked into gear before each of the last two (U.S.) trade figures, and they've been right,&quot; said one trader. &quot;It will be nice if they're right again.&quot; U.S. merchandise trade data for February are due out Thursday, and most Tokyo traders expect the deficit to narrow.    London share prices ended slightly lower in thin, featureless trading, as participants awaited news from the G-7 meeting.    The Financial Times 30-share index was down just 0.1 point at 1433.7, reflecting gains made by several large-capitalization stocks. Volume was scant at 364.7 million shares, down from 405.4 million Monday. The 100-share index was 5.2 points lower at 1805.3.    Shares traded in positive territory for much of the day but fell off in the afternoon on lack of buying interest.    Shares got little help from the pound's continuing easing against both the dollar and mark. &quot;People are awaiting more news on the G-7 meeting,&quot; widely expected to take place Wednesday in conjunction with the interim meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. A disappointing result from the G-7 likely would hit London equities, dealers said.    There was little corporate news to move the market. Among the 100-index stocks, 58 were lower, 14 were unchanged and 28 showed gains.    B.A.T Industries gained 6 pence to 440 ($8.20), continuing gains made Monday on news that Farmers Group had agreed to meet with the company's U.S. subsidiary to discuss B.A.T's takeover bid.    Burmah Oil gained on takeover speculation triggered by a bid for Quaker State of the U.S. by an investor group. Burmah shares rose 8 to 522.    Also in the oil sector, Shell Transport andamp; Trading gained 1 penny to #10.88 ($20.25), but British Petroleum lost 3.5 to 274.    International stocks showed a mixed response to the dollar's gains. BOC Group rose 5 to 389, but Glaxo Holdings lost 2 to #10.29, and Imperial Chemical Industries fell 5 to #10.16.    Frankfurt share prices finished on a mixed note in lackluster dealings amid signs of market consolidation following Monday's rally.    Stocks opened the day at sharply higher levels as some market participants, encouraged by a firm dollar, attempted to push up prices. But their effort wasn't successful, dealers said, because of a lack of enthusiasm among domestic and foreign investors. Trading volume remained thin throughout the day.    Most blue-chip issues ended the day on the minus side, pressured by widespread profit-taking in the second half of the trading session.    Daimler-Benz shares were among the biggest losers, falling 6.50 marks to 632.50 marks ($376). Other car makers didn't follow suit. Bayerische Motoren Werke rose 2 to 520, Porsche fell 1 to 530, and Volkswagen ended unchanged at 249.3.    Retailers gained. Karstadt rose 5 to 468, Horten was 1 mark higher at 193, and Kaufhof edged up 0.5 mark to 398.5.    Preussag, a metals, energy and mining group, rose 3 to 157. The company announced it was in talks with a French mining group to start a joint project in metals processing.    Shares of electronics companies declined. Siemens lost 6 to 368.5, Nixdorf fell 7 to 535, and AEG was down 1.1 to 245.7. Dealers attributed these losses to profit-taking.    Meanwhile, shares closed higher in Stockholm and Milan, mixed in Paris, Zurich and Amsterdam and flat in Brussels.    Stockholm shares edged up to their third consecutive post-crash high in trading dominated by the U.S. market's overnight rise and the stable dollar. Forestry companies and investment concerns posted the day's best gains, while retailers turned in moderate losses.    Asian markets were lower. Share prices fell in Sydney, Manila, Hong Kong, Singapore, Wellington, Seoul and Taipei.    Seoul share prices dropped sharply in the opening session but closed slightly lower after institutional investors began buying issues to support the market. Brokers said most market participants stayed on the sidelines amid spreading labor strikes at major companies.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                    % This                                 Apr 11    Apr 8    Year    U.S. ....................    248.6     247.9   + 8.4    Britain .................    544.6     535.8   + 5.6    Canada ..................    372.5     371.3   + 6.2    Japan ...................   1298.4    1293.0   +27.0    France ..................    303.1     295.7   + 5.1    Germany .................    170.5     168.9   + 8.9    Hong Kong ...............   1902.6    1885.0   +15.7    Switzerland .............    151.2     149.8   + 7.4    Australia ...............    288.8     282.1   +11.4    World index .............    461.1     460.3   +13.0</TEXT></DOC>
