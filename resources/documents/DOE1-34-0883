<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-34-0883 </DOCNO><TEXT>Relative to Alberta, knowledge regarding medium- and long-range transportof air pollutants/acid rain and the biological effects of longterm, low-levelemissions is presently limited. Some concerns are acidification of surfacewaters and the potential consequences for aquatic biota, including fish,acidification of soils and their influence on the total watershed, vegetation,and aquatic systems, direct effects on agricultural crops and foresttree species, and direct and indirect effects on human and animal health.Alberta Environment established an Acid Deposition Research Program (ADRP)to provide scientific information for evaluating and reviewing Alberta'scurrent air quality standards, emission guidelines, and regulatory controlswith respect to socio-economic and environmental consequences of atmosphericpollutants and to satisfy the concerns of Albertans. The objective ofthe monitoring program is to monitor precipitation quality, exposureto SO/sub 4/ and H/sub 2/S in and around urban centres and industrialareas; the potentially adverse effects of atmospheric acid depostionon Alberta's soil resource; and water quality of Alberta rivers and lakes.The research program will undertake studies to determine tha capacityof the ecosystem to resist detrimental effects. Work will be undertakenon control technologies to reduce emissions at their source. The AlbertaEnvironmental Centre is undertaking a study on the health effects ofsulphur gases. The objective is to determine the effects of toxic, orpotentially toxic, gases, vapours, particulates, and aerosols on animalsand, by extrapolation, on humans. 17 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
