Until fairly recently, a high-handed Bank of Japan simplydictated the nation's interest rates and left little tointerpretation.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There was no question of supply and demand,&quot; says oneobserver. &quot;It wasn't a real market.&quot;   It is now. Sweeping deregulation in the past three yearshas transformed Japan's money market into a $1 trillion poolof money, magnified the Bank of Japan's importance in theglobal financial markets and created a whole field ofanalysts who monitor the central bank. Today, the question ofwhether the central bank in Tokyo soon will ease credit keepsworld markets on tenterhooks.   The question is particularly relevant now. Last week,managers from the Bank of Japan's 33 domestic branchesconcluded a closed-door meeting at which they discussedcredit policy. In spite of the central bank's insistence thatthe economy remains strong, market expectations that themanagers would endorse an easing of interest rates, to spurJapan's economy, contributed to a 475.29-point, or 1.8%,rally in the Nikkei average of 225 shares on the Tokyo StockExchange last week, and prompted many banks to lower therates charged to their best customers for loans. But thosemarket indicators aren't what really matter.   Like the Federal Reserve Bank or Germany's mightyBundesbank, the Bank of Japan enunciates most of its majorpolicies through the marketplace, discreetly shifting gears-- and interest rates -- by various kinds of intervention,from buying or selling corporate commercial paper andgovernment bonds to making or recalling loans to banks.   For the Bank of Japan, it's a fragile new realm. Since theauthorities stopped setting rates in 1988, the bank has beentrying to develop an identity of its own, without alienatingthe nation's powerful Ministry of Finance -- which retainsultimate veto power over monetary policy but no longer hasmuch say in day-to-day rates. At the same time, rates inJapan have a more direct impact than ever on rates in theU.S. or Europe, not to mention prosperity at home. Misstepshave sent Japan's financial markets tumbling and causedprofits at some of the world's largest banks and securitieshouses to crash.   One result: One group of economists suddenly is ascendant.Known in the markets as &quot;Bank of Japan watchers,&quot; the newbreed includes former officials of the Fed, the U.S. Treasuryand some international financial institutions, as well as atleast one former employee of the Bank of Japan itself. Thewatchers carefully plot out guideposts that financial marketsand other economists follow.   &quot;You know the basic approach, what they look at, and eventhe personalities,&quot; says Richard Woodworth, an economist atMerrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s Tokyo office and a U.S. Treasuryofficial for nine years. &quot;If you only know the perspective ofmarkets from the private-sector side, you sometimes won'tunderstand&quot; what the Bank of Japan is doing, adds Richard C.Koo, a senior economist at Nomura Research Institute Ltd. anda former analyst for the New York Fed.   The consequences of a misunderstanding can be devastating.The most stunning evidence came at the end of December 1989,when the financial markets misread Bank of Japan motives andtilted into a three-month nosedive that erased more than $1trillion in stock-market capitalization and hundreds ofbillions of dollars more in bond values.   What set off the plunge was the shock of a Christmas Dayincrease in the Bank of Japan's discount rate, the amount thecentral bank charges banks on loans and the lowest rate inthe financial system. Most Bank of Japan watchers werestunned by the move, because few believed the central bankwas in the process of raising interest rates. The centralbank blames seasonal factors for misleading analysts.   The result was market chaos. &quot;The Bank of Japan slippedup,&quot; says Aaron Cohen, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Co.Nomura's Mr. Koo was harsher: &quot;It was a fiasco. Nobody reallyhad a good sense of how seasonal factors worked.&quot;   Because the liberalized money markets are relativelyyoung, the Bank of Japan is still experimenting, saysMarshall Gittler, a bond-market analyst at UBS-Philips andamp; DrewInternational Ltd. Last year, he says, the central bank begantrying to influence interest rates by buying and sellingcommercial paper, a kind of corporate IOU traded mainly amongbanks. But it has largely dropped that mechanism in recentmonths, after analysts began reading too much into thecentral bank's activities.   That's always a pitfall for market watchers. Many now aretrying to figure out just when the central bank will nextalter -- presumably lower -- its discount rate, the one-timebenchmark for most other rates in Japan. The discount ratenow stands at 6%, up from an historic low of 2.5% in early1989. Many analysts think the central bank will have to easecredit soon, to avoid choking the economy. The markets jumpat any hint that the discount rate may be coming down.   But Bank of Japan watchers say that the discount rateisn't the number to follow. Rather, they say, Japan's moneymarket is guided chiefly by the amount charged on overnightunsecured loans among banks, and that rate remains firm. Theovernight rate is the rough equivalent of the overnightFederal Funds rate -- the amount U.S. banks charge on loansto one another. No longer does the central bank focus on thediscount rate, they say; instead, it injects or withdrawsmoney into the overnight market to affect the amount of moneyavailable and its price-interest rates. One senior Bank ofJapan official even calls the overnight rate &quot;my interventionrate&quot; and scoffs at the continuing attention to theonce-crucial discount rate, which now serves as the basis forvery few other interest rates in Japan.   The openness of the central bank is a marked change fromthe past. Until November 1988, nearly all of Japan'sfinancial markets but the stock market were closelyregulated. When the government sold bonds, it negotiated theinterest rates with a cartel of banks and securitiescompanies. When a bank wanted to borrow from another bank, ithad to go through a government-designated broker, who quotedinterest rates set each morning by the Bank of Japan.Regulation even extended to the man on the street: most yensavings accounts at banks paid government-set interest ratesof less than 1% a year, and the size of non-yen accountsindividuals could hold was strictly limited.   The effect of the rules was to keep control of money inJapan's centrally managed economy in the hands of a fewgovernment officials and the Bank of Japan. For most of thepost-war period, the authorities monitored the cash spigotclosely. Only once, after the 1973 oil shock, did the centralbank let inflation get out of hand and into double digits.   By the mid-1980s, though, Japan's economy was second onlyin size to America's and the authorities decided toliberalize, under pressure not only from financialinstitutions but from Washington. &quot;It became necessary,&quot; saysone of the decisionmakers.</TEXT></DOC>
