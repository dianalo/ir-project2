Coastal pointed out that the friend-of-the-court brief dealt only with the breach-of-contract portion of the litigation. Should a federal appeals court in Denver rule for Los Angeles-based Occidental only in that portion of the suit, Coastal added, the $412 million judgment could be reduced by a maximum of about $60 million.    In November 1986, a federal court jury in Wyoming awarded Coastal $724 million in the case. A federal judge later upheld the ruling, but reduced the damages to $412 million.    The suit, filed in 1984, charged that Occidental's Natural Gas Pipeline Co. unit stopped purchasing gas from Coastal's Colorado Interstate Gas Co. unit and refused to release Colorado Interstate from the contract. The Coastal unit, in turn, was forced to cancel its contract with its supplier. Natural Gas Pipeline then secured a contract directly with the Coastal unit's supplier, cutting out the middleman, Coastal alleged.    Though the energy commission challenged the jury's finding that Natural Gas Pipeline had breached its contract with Colorado Interstate, the agency left unchallenged the other two findings, which involve antitrust violations and tortious interference claims, Coastal said. The company, which is involved in oil-and-gas exploration, refining and transmission, said it and its attorneys &quot;remain convinced they will prevail on all three issues.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
