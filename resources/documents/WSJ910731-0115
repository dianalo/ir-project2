GTE has been operating its Airfone service under atemporary &quot;experimental&quot; license for the last 11 years. Thecompany said it currently provides public phone service toair travelers on more than 1,500 commercial planes operatedby 14 domestic carriers and one foreign airline.</LP><TEXT>   However, in granting GTE its permanent license, the FCCprohibited GTE Airfone from enforcing terms of its currentcontracts with airlines that prevent them from immediatelyconsidering rival services.   &quot;The commission felt that GTE had enough market share tocreate a potentially anti-competitive advantage in themarketplace,&quot; said Gregory Vogt, chief of the FCC's MobileServices Division. &quot;The existence of competitive playersshould improve service and the permanent licenses shouldallow these competitors to make technological changes morequickly.&quot;   &quot;The condition (set by the FCC) isn't a problem for us,&quot;said Terry S. Parker, president of GTE TelecommunicationsProducts and Services. &quot;Nobody has told us they'reanticipating going to a rival service.&quot;   The FCC actually notified GTE of its permanent licenselast Tuesday. That was six months after granting permanentgreen lights to four rivals, including In-Flight Phone Corp.,Oak Brook, Ill., which was founded by Jack D. Goeken,Airfone's originator. Mr. Goeken is now a rival of GTE forair-to-ground phone customers.   GTE, which said it has handled more than 11 million callsover the Airfone network, equips each plane that uses itsservice with radio transmitter/receivers and an airbornecomputer unit, which helps the transmitter/receiver on theplane to establish a connection with a ground station. Whenthe station has been found, the call is transmitted via radiosignals and patched into the regular public switched network.GTE charges a $2 flat fee per call, plus $2 per minute.Weekend calls cost a $1 base fee, plus $1 a minute. Rivals'fees haven't yet been been set.   However, the FCC's Mr. Vogt noted that Airfone's servicehad been spotty due to delayed dial tones and poorconnections. And he said GTE will have to retune all of itsequipment to the four megahertz of frequency spectrum thatthe FCC has permanently set aside for air-to-ground radiocommunications.   &quot;Airfone's current service of providing one-way callingand transmission to microwave towers on the ground isantiquated compared with services that will use satellites bythe mid-90s,&quot; said Kenneth Leon, an analyst at Bear, Stearnsandamp; Co.   Mr. Goeken, who fought several court battles with GTE inthe last two years for the right to offer a competingservice, is close to launching his In-Flight service.In-Flight offers all-digital transmission, includingair-to-ground data communications. A data jack in the armrestof the seat will allow a traveler using a portable laptopcomputer or fax machine to send messages to the ground.In-Flight, which began installing its phones in American,USAir and Northwest jetliners in June, is currentlyconstructing a system of 89 ground stations to carry thetraffic to the public network. Service is scheduled to beginby late October, said a spokesman.   &quot;We're installing equipment in every seat, as opposed toevery third seat like GTE's service, offering more lines tothe ground,&quot; said an In-Flight spokesman. &quot;We have to offer abetter mousetrap since GTE (Airfone) is so big.&quot;   However, Airfone is also improving. To boost call-handlingcapacity, GTE recently installed a high-speed digital databackbone network to connect its nearly 100 ground stationsthroughout the U.S. And it has an agreement withCommunications Satellite Corp. to offer satellite-basedinternational service by year end. In addition, GTE has beeninstalling new software that is supposed to give a caller animmediate dial tone and better connections to the ground.&quot;The installation of digital equipment on aircraft won't becompleted for a couple of years&quot; from now, said Mr. Parker.   Airfone's other rivals, licensed by the FCC last December,are Clairtel Communications Group L.P., Kirkland, Wash.;Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp., Jackson, Miss.;and American Skycell Corp., West Atlantic City, N.J. Anotherlicense was granted in February to Jet-Tel Group L.P.,Wilmington, Del.   In late trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,GTE was quoted at $29.125, down 25 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
