Castrejon chargedthat she was a victim of sex discrimination because her employer, TortilleriaLa Mejor, had refused to reinstate her as promised after she tried to returnto her assembly-line job after a maternity leave.;    Douglas Farmer, a lawyerfor the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in San Francisco, whichreceives more than 100,000 complaints filed under Title VII each year, saidthe ruling meant that &quot;our investigators won't have to check the immigrationstatus of every case that comes in the doors -- be a mini-Immigration andNaturalization Service.&quot;;    The ruling clarifies the issue of whetherundocumented workers are protected by federal employment discrimination lawwhile they go through the process of seeking amnesty under the sweepingImmigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, as Castrejon has.;    Her formeremployer, a tortilla factory in Farmersville, a small town in the San JoaquinValley, argued that because the Immigration Act prohibited the employment ofundocumented workers, its purposes would be undermined if those workers wereentitled to bring civil lawsuits under federal law charging discrimination inthe workplace.;    Castrejon, who is now free to pursue her lawsuit againstthe tortilla factory, has worked packing fruit and at a plant nursery over thelast several years.;    She is seeking reinstatement in her job and back pay,the only remedies available under Title VII. Coyle set Oct. 1 for the trial.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910306  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  511  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 6, 199100066154,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
