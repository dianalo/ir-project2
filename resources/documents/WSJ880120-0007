On her left are some ladies' shorts ready to be seamed. And on her mind is politics -- and the Iowa caucuses that, she worries, are deflecting some attention from the New Hampshire primary.    &quot;I was born here in New Hampshire and no one from any other state has ever changed my mind about anything,&quot; says the 61-year-old Republican who works in the Plymouth Stitching Inc. plant here. &quot;They can have their caucuses, but I'm not listening.&quot;    Niels Nielsen, the caretaker of the Old Man of the Mountains, wears a New Hampshire belt buckle and a wooden tie clasp in the shape of the great stone face, the symbol of the rugged independence of New Hampshire's White Mountains. &quot;Iowa's become big,&quot; says Mr. Nielsen, who is a supporter of Pat Robertson, &quot;but nobody's going to tell us in New Hampshire what to do.&quot;    From the seacoast to the still north of New Hampshire, which for more than a third of a century has prided itself as being the nation's presidential selection committee, the people of this state once again are asserting their independence -- and vowing that the Iowa caucuses, which are to be held Feb. 8, won't dictate the results of the New Hampshire primary eight days later.    More than regional pride is at stake. Since 1952, no one has been elected president without first winning the New Hampshire primary. Moreover, the people of this state -- Willa Cather, who is buried in Jaffrey Center, described them as &quot;hard workers, close traders, with good minds, mean natures and flinty eyes&quot; -- have a history of upsetting front-runners, surprising prognosticators and altering the political landscape.    Four years ago Walter Mondale barreled out of Iowa with a big victory only to watch Gary Hart, then an unknown Colorado senator, win a stunning upset in the Democratic primary. George Bush's &quot;Big Mo&quot; campaign, launched by a victory in Iowa in 1980, was derailed by Ronald Reagan. Both Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller were overshadowed by a write-in campaign in behalf of Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge in 1964, and President Harry Truman was decisively defeated by Estes Kefauver in 1952.    But politicians and political experts believe that the importance of the New Hampshire primary has changed as a result of the growing attention paid to the caucuses in Iowa.    &quot;Iowa makes the first cut,&quot; says Joseph Grandmaison, the state's Democratic chairman. &quot;But if Iowa pares the field from seven to four, we cut it down to two -- or two plus Jesse Jackson. We used to frame the questions. Now we choose the finalists.&quot;    A University of New Hampshire poll indicates that a minimum of a third of the state's voters acknowledge they would consider supporting another candidate if their first choice doesn't do well in Iowa. &quot;Iowa has really skewed the New Hampshire primary,&quot; says David Moore, a UNH political scientist. &quot;It affects how a candidate is perceived -- something that used to be determined more in New Hampshire.&quot;    Despite the enormous suburban-type growth in the southern part of New Hampshire, the first primary is still being conducted in a state where being cantankerous is conventional. &quot;We're a small, independent organism trying to retain our identity,&quot; says Donald Hall, the state's poet laureate, &quot;and we've developed a spiny outside.&quot;    Already candidates are shaping their messages to the peculiarities of this state, which contributes less than 2% of the delegates needed for nomination.    Vice President Bush, who is expected to be defeated by Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas in the Iowa Republican caucuses, has begun portraying the primary in New Hampshire, where he holds a substantial lead, as the principal early political test. &quot;America has changed a lot in the last four decades; so has the way we elect our presidents,&quot; says a new campaign brochure for Mr. Bush, who argued the opposite case eight years ago. &quot;But one rule of presidential politics remains the same: New Hampshire chooses presidents.&quot;    At the same time, Mr. Hart is portraying this state, scene of his greatest political triumph, as the first legitimate test. He has calculated that he isn't likely to do well in the Iowa Democratic caucuses because of his lack of a campaign organization.    Mr. Hart's return to the Democratic field, in fact, had the effect of revalidating the New Hampshire primary among Democrats. For several months, Gov. Michael Dukakis of neighboring Massachusetts, a staunch opponent of the nuclear power plant at Seabrook and a constant presence here because of the penetration of Boston television, was regarded as an easy victor in New Hampshire. He is still regarded the strong favorite, but if he prevails now, he will have the advantage of having beaten the only contender in the field with broad name recognition.    Candidates who perform poorly in Iowa but who manage to bring their campaigns east to New Hampshire will seek to portray the New Hampshire primary as a pure democratic (small d) test. &quot;We kind of look down on caucuses,&quot; says state Rep. Patricia Dwyer of Manchester.    The state is so jealous of its role as an early arbiter of politics that even New Hampshire Public Television turned down a live feed from the two Des Moines Register debates, to ensure that the people didn't become so saturated they wouldn't pay attention to last Saturday's GOP debate at Dartmouth College and this Sunday's Democratic debate at the University of New Hampshire.    Even so, the Iowa caucuses inevitably will reshape the political scene here. &quot;I have to believe Iowa will make a difference in New Hampshire if there's an unexpected result,&quot; says Michael Birkner, a columnist at the Concord Monitor. &quot;If the air goes out of someone's balloon in Iowa, it will affect his standing in New Hampshire.&quot;    GOP Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire calculates that a victory by his ally, Sen. Dole, in Iowa, will provide him with a boost of nearly 10 percentage points here. &quot;People aren't going to vote for Dole because he wins Iowa,&quot; says Mr. Rudman. &quot;They'll vote for him because for seven days he'll be all over the media. People will get a very good look at Bob Dole.&quot;    But there remain pockets of resistance. Wendy Stearns, who stands amid the hunters' caps, the extra-sharp cheese, the pots of chili and the cold cuts at the Lyme Country Store, argues that she'll ignore Iowa and reach her own conclusions. &quot;What do you have a mind for,&quot; she asks defiantly, &quot;if you don't use it?&quot;    ---            The New Hampshire Presidential Primary                  PRIMARY    YEAR          WINNERS          NOMINEES       PRESIDENT    1952          R  Eisenhower    Eisenhower     Eisenhower                  D  Kefauver      Stevenson    1956          R  Eisenhower    Eisenhower     Eisenhower                  D  Kefauver      Stevenson    1960          D  Kennedy       Kennedy        Kennedy                  R  Nixon         Nixon    1964          D  Johnson*      Johnson        Johnson                  R  Lodge*        Goldwater    1968          R  Nixon         Nixon          Nixon                  D  Johnson*      Humphrey    1972          R  Nixon         Nixon          Nixon                  D  Muskie        McGovern    1976          D  Carter        Carter         Carter                  R  Ford          Ford    1980          R  Reagan        Reagan         Reagan                  D  Carter        Carter    1984          R  Reagan        Reagan         Reagan                  D  Hart          Mondale    *Write-in</TEXT></DOC>
