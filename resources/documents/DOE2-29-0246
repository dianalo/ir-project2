However, the four-fold rise in oil pricesas a result of the Middle East War in 1973-4 made coal once more economicaland technical development work by the coal supply authority, which inthe United Kingdom is the National Coal Board (NCB), and by suppliersof fume control systems has reduced harmful emissions. Manufacturersof coal-burning boilers have evolved efficient automatic stoking equipment.Many of these manufacturers design and build complete packages, comprisingan integrated boiler, coal feeding and ash removal arrangements, withall functions controlled from one panel to provide a fully automaticsystem. The operation of this equipment is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
