 Aman interrupted and asked the doctor what to do aobut his ulcer.andP;  The doctormumbled something medical and the man, sagisfied, walked away.andP;  The doctorturned to the lawyer and said, 'I never know whether to send a bill whensomeone appropaches me for medical advice at a social function.andP;  What do youthink&quot;'  The lawyer replied that he felt it was perfectly acceptable to doso.andP;  So the doctor sent the man a bill.andP;  And the lawyer sent the doctor abill.&quot;andM;To those who recommended such uncouth retaliation for the party pooper'srudeness, shame on you.andP;  May of you said that you would state your consultingfee up front and ask the party pooper if he wished to continue.andP;  A fewopportunists even proposed setting up a barter system with y our fellowquest, trading technical support for work on your daughter's braces orwhatever.andM;The correct response, as about half of you pointed out, is to apologizepolitely for not wanting to discuss your work at a social function.andP;  &quot;Begracious,&quot; one reader wisely counsels.andP;  &quot;Your profession is ringed withpeople whose hobby is fiddling with computers.andP;  Avid hobbyists may notcomprehend how you feel.andP;  Most people will take a hint, but some will neverget the message.andP;  Keep bobbing and weaving.&quot;andM;After apoligizing, suggest that the party pooper call you at the office.andP;  Heprobably won't.andM;Paperless EtiquetteandM;This question came in two parts.andP;  A university researcher who depends onee-mail correspondence asked: &quot;What is the proper way to handle my salutationand closing when I correspond in this fashion?&quot;andM;E-mail is by nature an informal means of communication and thus calls forless-formal treatment than paper mail.andP;  Most of you felt that e-mailsalutations and closings should be identical to those of paper mail, with a&quot;Dear So-and-So&quot; greeting and a &quot;Sincerely&quot; closing.andP;  You are mistaken.andM;When communicating by e-mail, the recipient's name followed by a colon, dash,or comma is a suitable greeting; your name at the end is a perfectly adequateclosing, preceded by &quot;Thanks&quot; or &quot;Regards&quot; if such sentiments areappropriate.andP;  One reader summed it up nicely: &quot;Most people leave off the'Dear' in the salutation, although it certainly isn't a mistake to put it in.andO;It depends on how well you know the recipient and how often you communicate.&quot;andM;Many of you pointed out that e-mail services often include memo-like headerson messages; this, you said, precludes the need for a traditional greeting.andO;E-mail memo headings should be supplemented, however, with a more personalgreeting: &quot;Mr.andP;  Weatherbee:&quot; or &quot;Hello Walter,&quot; or simply &quot;Walter.&quot;andM;In the second part of the question, the researcher wondered: &quot;If I'm sendinga floppy disk through the mail, should I simply include my transmittal letteron the same disk (with a filename such as READ.ME), or must I print a hardcopy of it?&quot;andM;A chorus of agreement rang out on this matter.andP;  Always, always include a hardcopy of the transmittal letter when sending a disk through the mail.andM;Regarding the printed transmittal letter, a reader suggests: &quot;Whenever youmail a disk, state in a letter and on the disk label what the contents are,your name and phone number, and the program and version used to create thefile(s).andP;  The recipient's mail may be opened by other people, and letters canbe separated from disks.andP;  A DOS text READ.ME file should not substitute for aletter but supplement it.&quot;andM;Font EnvyandM;A manager, disgruntled that a colleague was spending a great deal of timeembellishing interoffice memos with fancy fonts and graphics, observed thathis employer saved all of his colleague's correspondence but only some of hisown.andP;  His question: &quot;Should I start imitating my colleague'sdesktop-publishing efforts?andP;  Is it appropriate for business correspondence tocontain such elaborate designs?&quot;andM;A number of your speculated that the boss might be saving the other fellow'smemos as evidence of how much time he's been wasting on the job.andP;  One readersympathized: &quot;I know just how you feel.andP;  We had a fellow whose presentationsmade the rest of us look as if we were using the first release ofCrayonWriter.andP;  Unfortunately, that did not save his job when the big crunchcame.&quot;andM;There is no place for gratuitous ornamentation in business correspondence.andO;Fussy graphics may make a memo stand out, but if they fail to complement andenhance the thoughts expressed, they detract from the message.andP;  Those temptedto desktop-publishing frippery should take a lesson from advertising magnateDavid Ogilvy, from whose 1963 book Confessional of an Advertising Man wequote this passage, which has an eerie resonance today:andM;&quot;Once upon a time I was riding on the top of a Fifth Avenue bus, when I hearda mythical housewife say to another, 'Molly, my dear, I would have boughtthat new brand of toilet soap if only they hadn't set the body copy inten-point Garamond.'andM;&quot;Don't you believe it.andP;  What really decides consumers to buy or not to buy isthe content of your advertising, not its form.andP;  Your most important job is todecide what you are going to say about your product, what benefit you aregoing to promise.&quot;andM;The same principles apply when you're selling ideas within your business.andP;  Ifyour company has a standard format for interoffice memos, use it.andP;  If itdoesn't, follow this reader's sage advice: &quot;Create a template or style sheet,and use it for every memo you send.andP;  It will save time, and all your in-housecorrespondence will have a consistent look.&quot;andM;A final note: consider whether the boss is impressed by what your colleague'smemos say regardless of their appearance.andP;  One reader advised: &quot;Take abusiness writing course, and make your letters, memos, and reportssubstantive and meaningful.andP;  Spending three hours arranging butterflies inthe margin may yield an impressive-looking memo, but three hours of work on aconcise, interesting, and insightful document will pay off more to you andyour company.&quot;andM;The Dangling ConversationandM;A legal assistant was dismayed by his boss's tendency to rely on e-mail as asubstitute for conversation.andP;  &quot;How,&quot; he wondered, &quot;can I tactfully encourageher to address me face-to-face?&quot;andM;An important question went unanswered: Why does the boss behave this way?andO;Likely reasons are: (1) she's too busy to address you face-to-face; (2) she'stoo shy to address you face-to-face; (3) she doesn't like you.andM;One reader sent these worthy observations on interoffice e-mail protocol: &quot;Ilove my e-mail system.andP;  It saves me hours every day.andP;  Often I send asubordinate a message with the closing, 'Think about this, and let me knowwhen we can get together and talk about it.'andP;  I use the same technique withmy boss; once in a while I close with, 'I'd like to discuss this with youpersonally.andP;  When can you see me?'andP;  It's up to you to pull the boss out ofher e-mail shell.&quot;andM;The polite way to draw out your boss i to answer her e-mail messages in kind(obviously she prefers to make contact this way,) requesting an in-personmeeting to discuss the tasks at hand.andP;  If she agrees, don't waste her time:use the e-mail messages she's been sending you as an agenda for the meeting.andM;If the boss e-mails back that she isn't available for a face-to-face meeting,it may be that she is very busy or very shy.andP;  In this case, make your pointsand ask your questions in another e-mail message, requesting as much detailas possible.andP;  If your boss still can't meet with you, she doesn't like you.andO;Find another job.andM;Those Who Know Don't TeachandM;A PC journeyman wrote to say that he was frustrated by a coworker's tendencyto brush him aside and take over when helping him with a computer-orsoftware-related problem.andP;  He asked, &quot;How can I let him know that I'd ratherlearn the answers and not have someone just show me how to do everything?&quot;andM;Before proceeding to matters of protocol, let's hear the coworker's approachto this problem: &quot;Restrain yourself from asking 'easy' questions and insteadtry to figure out the answers yourself.andP;  Demonstrated that you've made aconcerted effort to solve the problem on your own.andP;  If you still have aproblem, ask your coworker where in the manual you can find a solution, whichshows that you are willing to learn.andP;  This may make him more willing toteach.&quot;andP;  Got that?andP;  The office computer expert probably has work of his ownto do.andM;If you've tried to solve the problem and still need help, consider whatanother computer whiz had to say: &quot;I'm one of those people who find it easierto solve a computer-related problem than to teach the answer.andP;  What mycolleagues do--and this is very effective--is let me solve the problem andthen ask me to show them what I did.andP;  I don't mind teaching the answer oncethe problem is solved.&quot;andP;  When you coworker is kind enough to give you such anexplanation, be prepared.andP;  Pay attention to everything he does.andP;  Write donwthe steps as he shows them to you.andM;Another reader suggested a sneakier gambit, but one that's probably just aseffective: &quot;Get your screen booted up to the point where you're havingtrouble.andP;  Call your coworker and say, 'I've got my screen up, and I can'tfigure out how to ...andP;  Could you boot up the program and talk me throughit?'&quot;  And take notes!andM;Plight of the Would-Be PirateandM;After her request for a financial analysis program was turned down by apurchasing manager, a hospital employee was offered a pirated version of thesoftware.andP;  She mused: &quot;If I take the software, I may be in trouble if someonefinds out how I got it; if I don't, I can't demonstrate to my boss that Ineed the program.andP;  What do you advise?&quot;andM;This hotly contested issue received the greatest reader response of all.andO;Some of you advocated outright theft: &quot;Steal it.andP;  Being forced to buyshrink-wrapped software without the opportunity to test it is outrageous.andO;Never say where you got it.andP;  It's none of anyone's business.&quot;andP;  And another:&quot;Sure, go for it.andP;  Signed: Inmate #156353.&quot;andM;Many others guiltily observed that &quot;borrowing&quot; software for evaluationpurposes is a common practice that can benefit both the prospective buyer andthe software maker: &quot;It pains me to condone such behavior, but I sympathizewith anyone who's plowed through a tedious demo disk that describes everyfeature and function of a program except the ones he's interested in.andP;  Therisk of your being found out during a limited run for evaluation purposes isinsignificant.&quot;andM;Others were not so guilty: &quot;Borrow the pirated version and demonstrate theproduct to your employer.andP;  Such practices are often done.andP;  Neither softwarecompanies nor employers are upset by this, as both stand to gain from it.andP;  Aslong as the software is purchased if it continues to be used, no wrong hasbeen done.&quot;andM;Some of you were philosophical: &quot;Huck Finn confronted a similar dilemma over'borrowing' watermelons: 'Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things,if you was meaning to pay them back, sometime; but the widow said it warn'tanything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.'&quot;andM;We agree with the widow.andP;  If you want to check out a software package,contact the manufacturer and ask for an evaluation copy.andP;  (An overwhelmingmajority of you suggested this tactic.)andP;  If the software company refuses, buythe program from a retailer that has a full-refund policy (generallyeffective for 30 days).andP;  If that doesn't work, try renting the software.andP;  Asa last resort, ask the manufacturer for a demo copy.andM;As long as the soapbox is out, we'll say this: expecting a buyer to make asound purchase decision based on a crippled demo copy--or even asalesperson's demo--is like asking someone to buy a suit before trying it on.andO;Remember this, dear readers, and patronize manufacturers and retailers thatoffer full refunds to buyers who no longer want the software after areasonable test period.andP;  They're setting a good example.andM;Hitting the NotebooksandM;A business law professor, annoyed by the clicking of laptops during hislectures, ruminated: &quot;Is it within my bounds to forbid laptop use?andP;  Or isthere a keyboard muffler that I might recommend?&quot;andM;This is a sticky situation, isn't it?andP;  On the one hand, we have universitiesdemanding that their students become computer literate.andP;  On the other, wehave a professor who is distracted by laptops in the classroom.andM;One side voices this opinion: &quot;This is the most self-serving, ridiculouswhine I've heard in a long time.andP;  One should encourage tools that assist thelearning process.andP;  If the laptops bother you, wear earplugs.&quot;andM;However, we also have this view: &quot;Laptop computer use in a lecture classshould be strictly verboten at all times.andP;  No argument.andP;  No appeal.andP;  Nextcase.&quot;andM;Most of you, though, embraced the spirit of compromise.andP;  Of course aprofessor has the right to ban laptops in the classroom--if the noise isdisturbing to him, surely it must bother non-laptop-equipped students aswell.andP;  But before making a ruling, consider these few alternatives:andM;&quot;Any student who can cough up the dough for a laptop should be able to afforda cassette recorder.andP;  The laptop-rattling technocrats should keep theircomputers at home, record the lectures, and transcribe them at theirleisure.&quot;andM;&quot;Come on, now, all educated people can still take notes on paper, can'tthey?&quot;andM;&quot;Make your lecture notes available on paper and/or on disk.&quot;andM;&quot;If the productivity of the students has improved because of their electronicnote-taking, it might be worth allowing the use of laptops.andP;  Perhaps studentsusing them could sit in the rear of the classroom so the noise is lessnoticeable.&quot;andM;Finally, we received this forward-looking recommendation: &quot;If your collegehas the resources, construct small sound baffles over at least half of thedesks in the classroom, modeled after the printer 'mufflers' used in modernoffices.andP;  The campus carpenter should be able to come up with something usingSonex sound-absorbent foam, plywood, and Plexiglas.andP;  Have him include some ACoutlets as well and maybe a phone jack.&quot;andM;While all this construction is going on, we will be looking forward to theday when laptops are smart enough to do the transcribing themselves.andM;Computus InterruptusandM;An office manager, miffed when his cubicle-dwelling coworkers remainedmesmerized by the computer screen when he walked in, wondered: &quot;Is itacceptable to go on working like this when someone enters an office?andP;  Isn'tthere a more polite way to show that one doesn't wish to be disturbed?&quot;andM;Two blunders are being committed here.andP;  First, you rudely enter yourcoworker's cubicle without an appointment.andP;  Then your coworker rudely ignoresyou.andP;  Common courtesy has gone out the window.andM;One reader summarized cubicle protocol thus: &quot;The entry to an open-sidedcubicle is roughly equal to an open office door.andP;  The same rules of courtesyloosely apply.andP;  Pause at the entry until acknowledged.andP;  If the cubicles aretight and pausing seems unnecessary, enter the cubicle but don't interruptuntil acknowledged.andP;  Then inquire about the timing of your visit.andP;  You mustask because you are the visitor.andP;  If invited to stay, offer your host a fewmoments to finish his work on the task at hand.&quot;andM;This takes care of the first blunder.andP;  If you plan to consume a great deal ofyour colleague's time, you should call or e-mail first and set up anappointment during which you should be entitled to his undivided attention.andM;On to the second blunder.andP;  Entering an office unannounced is indeed impolite,but purposely ignoring a visitor is far worse.andP;  No matter how difficult thetask or how tight the deadline, your colleague owes you his full attention,even if it is only to tell you that he is too busy to talk.andP;  &quot;If time is aproblem,&quot; one reader said, &quot;tell your guest how much time you can spare, anddon't be bashful about excusing yourself when the time has passed.&quot;andP;  Aprominently posted &quot;Do not disturb&quot; sign should, as some of you suggested,stave off all but the most necessary interruptions.andM;A final note: &quot;If you continue to get glassy 'semi-attention' from yourassociates, they may be sending you a quiet message that you are visiting toomuch.&quot;andM;Disappearing InkandM;This was a two-part problem.andP;  An insurance adjuster, weary of straining toread faintly printed output, asked: &quot;How can I urge those who still use dotmatrix printers to replace their ribbons?&quot;andM;First, a plea for mercy: &quot;Don't be too hard on the people with fadingribbons.andP;  Whenever I change a ribbon, I'm amazed at how much darker the printis.andP;  The print fades so gradually that I don't notice.&quot;andM;To our correspondent, who did notice, we forward this recommendation: &quot;Thebest way to urge people outside your office to change their ribbons is tophone the senders and politely request that they relate to you the contentsof the letter, as you are unable to read it.andP;  This requires a duplication ofeffort on their part that they will probably not want to repeat.&quot;andM;The writer also asked: &quot;Shouldn't employees tear off the holes and separatethe sheets when turning in work produced on sprocket-fed paper?andP;  If I tellthem that I will not accept work in this annoying and unprofessional format,how do I reject their requests for laser printers, which I can't afford?&quot;andM;We were shocked--shocked!--that some of you considered this to be a trivialmatter.andP;  Fortunately, you were outnumbered by those enlightened readers whoknow that proper dot matrix decorum requires tearing off the sprocket holesand separating the sheets.andP;  It is tacky in the extreme not to do so.andM;With interoffice correspondence, each office should have acceptable neatnessstandards (legible printing, separating of sheets, and so forth) that allemployees adhire to.andP;  Keep the supply cabinet well stocked with ribbons andtoner.andM;If your company is willing to incur some expense for neater output, considerthese alternatives: buy a cut-sheet feeder for the dot matrix machine, or buyone laser printer for the office and get an inexpensive print spooler so thateveryone can share it.andM;Finally, a special creativity award goes to the reader who came up with thissuggestion: &quot;Your colleagues' goal is to save time and effort.andP;  It does taketime to prepare documents from a dot matrix printer.andP;  Do a time-in-motionstudy detailing how long it takes to tear and burst dot matrix output.andO;Multiply the result by the amount paid to those doing the chores.andP;  Extend itover the life of the machine.andP;  Now join the 20th century and buy a laserprinter.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
