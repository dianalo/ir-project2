No or negligible seasonal pH variations were observed in precipitations.Diminished inputs of SO/sub 4/ and NO/sub 3/ as a result of reduced precipitationquantities and hardly altered outputs of SO/sub 4/ and NO/sub 3/ maybe expected to produce a negative SO/sub 4/ balance and a levelled NO/sub3/ balance in contrast to positive balances obtaining to date. Heavymetals investigated to date revealed Fe, Cu, and Pb to be retained inthe treetops at varying amounts. This is where especially Mn, Zn, andCd, too, are washed out, and all heavy metals except Fe are accumulatedin the soils. To separate run-off components, near-surface slope run-off(interflow) was measured at an appropriate site and determined to makeup 60% of total run-off during a precipitation run-off event. To studyeffects in ecotopes, mineralization of organic matter was linked to establishedclimatic and edaphic site factors. Current N mineralization in the mainrootzone exceeds NO/sub 3/ input by precipitations by far.</TEXT></DOC>
