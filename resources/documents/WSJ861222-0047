The Chantilly, Va.-based company's Fairchild Space Co. division was chosen for the work by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. The contract's value will be set during negotiations leading to an official award in May. The contract will run through 1994.    The satellite will be used as part of the Ocean Topography Experiment, which is planned as a joint mission with France. The satellite, which will be launched by a French unmanned Ariane rocket, will measure the sea level of the global oceans over time to determine their general circulation and surface features. Such data are important to developing a better understanding of the role of the oceans in climate changes. </TEXT></DOC>
