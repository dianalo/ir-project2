Although recent government data suggest only modest economic growth for the second quarter, investors' and analysts' expectations are high that growth in profits will be strong. As corporations begin to report their second-quarter results this month, Wall Street will pay extra attention to see if companies' actual profits meet expectations.    Analysts who expect the bull market to continue through next year say higher corporate profits will be needed to drive up stock prices. Although corporate profit growth has been somewhat anemic in the past four years, a sharp decline in interest rates made stocks attractive and brought many investors to the market.    The same factors that contributed to strong earnings growth in the first quarter are expected to continue. Among them, says Gary Yalen, chief investment officer at Irving Trust Co. in New York, are the big corporate restructurings of the past few years, in which companies shed inefficient and unprofitable plants and units; cost controls, including limited wage increases this year; and a lower dollar, which lessens competition for U.S.-manufactured goods at home and expands their markets abroad.    Some of the industry groups that are expected to show the biggest earnings gains for the second quarter are areas that will be rebounding from losses reported in the 1986 period, such as steel and crude oil producers.    According to Zacks Investment Research Inc. in Chicago, which monitors Wall Street analysts' earnings estimates, three big steel companies, Armco, Bethlehem Steel and USX Corp., are expected to have turned a profit in the second quarter, compared with huge losses a year earlier.    Barry Sahgal, a managing director in charge of research at Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co. in New York, notes that many steel companies closed down unnecessary plants and operations and cut their labor costs. He adds that steel prices have been moving higher since mid-1986 and interest expenses dropped for many steel companies after their restructurings.    For companies tied to the oil industry, &quot;Rising crude prices are a double-edged sword,&quot; Mr. Sahgal says. He notes that while higher oil prices benefit oil producers, they work against companies in the refining and marketing industry. This year, prices for finished products such as gasoline have been slow to rise and inventories are high, he adds, which could put an additional squeeze on profit margins in the refining business.    As the accompanying table shows, airlines are expected to post a big improvement for the second quarter. Big turnarounds are expected in this industry; companies such as Pan Am, Texas Air and Trans World Airlines should show profits, after reporting big losses last year, say analysts at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    The outlook is less rosy for truckers and railroads. The Prudential-Bache analysts say a recent rate war has destroyed operating profits for the truckers.    The Prudential-Bache team also expects a better showing for specialty chemical companies, whose net income was dragged down last year by a disastrous quarter in the fertilizer industry. Higher prices for paper products will benefit such companies as Stone Container and Federal Paper Board, they add.    Higher pricing also probably helped the metals companies. The Prudential-Bache analysts point out metals prices are usually at their highest in the second quarter, but last year was an aberration, and prices stayed flat. Metals prices rose this year, so the earnings gains look big, the analysts say.    Some naysayers on Wall Street warn that analyst and investor expectations for earnings this year may already be too high, pumped up by the strong results of the first quarter. Abby Joseph Cohen, an investment strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, is taking the opposite view. She believes there are some groups for which the consensus might be too low.    She believes companies in this category are those in such industries as broadcasting, computers and business equipment -- including International Business Machines -- drugs, electronics, food, retail department stores and soap.    Ms. Cohen says IBM is a prime example of a company for which earnings expectations are low. She believes demand is strong for IBM's new personal computer systems, which provide a higher profit margin for the company. She also expects that businesses, which aren't likely to spend on new plants, will invest in computer and data processing equipment.    While concern that consumer spending will decline this year has turned some investors away from retailers, Ms. Cohen is less worried. She expects the consumer will still be spending on clothing, cosmetics and other nondurable items, while cutting back on spending for new housing and furnishings.    As usual, investors will be quick to bid up the stock price of companies reporting earnings that exceed expectations, while showing no mercy for companies that disappoint them, analysts add.    ---            PROFIT PREDICTIONS    Selected industries with expected    second-quarter earnings increases:    Airlines                   +718%    Gas utilities              +444    Metals*                    +272    Home furnishing            +184    Gas pipelines              +140    Semiconductors             +135    Selected industries with expected    second-quarter earnings declines:    Construction machinery      -42%    Retail food chains          -39    Brokerage firms             -33    Thrifts                     -29    Radio andamp; TV                  -22    Railroads                   -22   *This group doesn't include aluminum companies   Source: Zacks Investment Research Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
