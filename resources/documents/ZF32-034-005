QuainandM;Much-publicized for years but never actually built into a laptop until late1990, the GRiD IsoPoint is very much an acquired taste.andP;  Users may love orhate IsoPoint, a solid straw-shaped shaft set into the very front of aportable computer, parallel to the Spacebar.andP;  You roll the shaftfront-to-back and slide it left and right to move the mouse cursor around thescreen.andM;The only real design restrictions are that IsoPoint must be built in, notadded on, and that the keyboard must be set back about an inch from the frontedge of the laptop case.andP;  The IsoPoint's rolling shaft is less than aquarter-inch in diameter and about 2.8 inches long.andP;  Two buttons flank eachside of the shaft.andP;  The inner buttons act as the main (left) mouse buttons,the outer buttons as the secondary (right) mouse buttons.andP;  You can also clickon the bar itself, although doing so without simultaneously moving the cursoris difficult.andP;  Using your thumb, you roll the bar to move the cursorvertically, and slide the bar from side to side for horizontal control.andO;There is just enough leeway in the bar's physical sideways motion to move thearrow from one side of the screen to the other.andM;Once you grow accustomed to its interface, you can use the IsoPoint to movethe cursor without lifting your fingers from the keyboard.andP;  The tricky partis using drawing and paint packages.andP;  In its default mode (450 ppi), theIsoPoint zips the cursor around a little too quickly for some tastes, but itssensitivity and acceleration (or ballistic tracking) can be adjusted from theDOS command line or with a TSR control panel.andP;  If you choose to use astandalone pointing device, you can disable the driver from DOS.andP;  TheIsoPoint uses standard Microsoft Mouse drivers.andM;The IsoPoint's mechanical rolling-bar-and-button system was invented by GRiDSystems' Craig Culver.andP;  Currently, if you want the IsoPoint, you are limitedto one computer: the GRiDCase 1550SX, $5,095 with a 60MB hard disk andinternal modem.andP;  (You can also buy the computer with a CD-ROM drive as the1550CD.) At 12.7 pounds and 2.5 by 11.5 by 15 inches (HWD), the GRiDCase isnot on the cutting edge of packaging.andP;  But little of the the unit's bulk(other than an inch of the depth) is related to the IsoPoint.andP;  Zenith DataSystems (708-808-4800) expects to ship its new SupersPort 486 and 486SXportable with the IsoPoint before year's end, but these machines will also beheavy: more than 14 pounds.andM;GRiD IsoPointandM;GRiD Systems Corp., 47211 Lakeview Blvd., Fremont, CA 94537; 800-222-4743.andM;List Price: $5,095 for the GRiDCase 1550SX laptop with the IsoPointinstalled.andP;  In Short: A rotating, sliding, straw-shaped shaft built into alaptop in front of the Spacebar, the IsoPoint adds about an inch to the depthof a portable PC.andP;  Its desirability is much a factor of personal preference.andO;Currently available in the 13-pound GRiDCase 1550SX, it is planned forinclusion later in the year in a pair of equally bulky Zenith portables.andM;CIRCLE 545 ON READER SERVICE CARD</TEXT></DOC>
