Co. agreed to buy the half of Cable Value Network that it doesn't already own and to pay for the stake with warrants that can be converted into common stock.    Terms of the agreement in principle call for the 17 cable-television operators who hold the other half of Cable Value Network to receive about eight million warrants. Each warrant would be convertible into one C.O.M.B. share at an exercise price of $18.125 a share. C.O.M.B. currently has about 18.1 million shares outstanding.    The value of the purchase couldn't yet be ascertained. The cost to C.O.M.B., a direct-mail merchandiser, will depend on how much its share price is above that figure when the warrants are exercised; they expire in five years.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, C.O.M.B. stock closed at $20.25 a share, unchanged.    C.O.M.B.'s purchase would give it full control of the fast-growing home-shopping television network and a long-term commitment from the cable operators that they would carry the network.    C.O.M.B.'s board also voted to change C.O.M.B.'s name to CVN after the purchase.    Among the group of cable-television operators selling the stake are Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, the nation's largest cable operator; Viacom International Inc. of New York; and Warner Communications Inc. of New York.    &quot;There are a lot of positive benefits to this,&quot; said Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel, Calif. &quot;This is a way of bringing the 50% private portion into a public stock. As long as it was held privately it had no market value.&quot;    Such a move will help Cable Value fund its rapid growth through the capital markets and give C.O.M.B. full access to the cable operation's cash flow, Mr. Gerbrandt said. Also, the new setup will be more readily managed than the joint venture arrangement, said Mr. Gerbrandt.    Ted Deikel, chairman of C.O.M.B. and Cable Value, said the new arrangement will allow C.O.M.B. to apply its direct-marketing skill to the cable television business.    Cable Value's cable-company investors hope this marketing ability results in new services to woo and keep subscribers. The object is to clearly distinguish Cable Value from Clearwater, Fla.-based Home Shopping Network Inc.    Home Shopping is its biggest and oldest competitor, with $1 billion in annual sales. It has become even more formidable in recent months by branching beyond cable and onto the broadcast airwaves. It appears on UHF stations in some markets, a fact that concerns cable companies as they are charging subscribers for what Home Shopping is now giving away free in some areas.    Formed about a year ago, Cable Value is expected to have annual sales of $350 million to $400 million, said Mr. Deikel. </TEXT></DOC>
