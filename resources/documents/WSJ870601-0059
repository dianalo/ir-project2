Edelman and Dominion Textile Inc., this one demanding that a proposed leveraged buyout of Burlington be blocked.    As in another Edelman-Dominion lawsuit filed in April, the complaint alleges that Burlington management -- in pursuing alternatives to the Edelman-Dominion group's hostile bid of $77 a share, or $1.84 billion, for the 86.4% of Burlington that it doesn't already own -- is seeking to &quot;entrench&quot; itself at the expense of shareholders. The suit demands more than $250 million in damages.    As previously reported, Greensboro, N.C.-based Burlington, a textile company, has agreed to be acquired by a group led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. in a leveraged buyout for $76 a share, or $2.09 billion. Mr. Edelman and Dominion have said in a Securities and Exchange filing that they had held talks with Morgan Stanley representatives about possibly settling matters, and sources have said the suitors offered to end their hostile bid in exchange for payment of more than $25 million and the right to buy certain Burlington businesses.    Mirroring what Mr. Edelman and Montreal-based Dominion said in a letter to Burlington's chairman last week, the latest lawsuit claims that a $25 million &quot;bust-up&quot; fee that Morgan Stanley would receive if the leveraged buyout falls through is illegal. The lawsuit also names the Morgan Stanley leveraged-buyout group as a defendant.    Meanwhile, BI/MS Holdings Inc., the formal name for the Morgan Stanley group, said Friday that Bankers Trust Co., Chemical Bank and Wells Fargo Bank have committed to $1.5 billion of a $1.85 billion credit facility in connection with the proposed buyout. The three banks expect to syndicate the remaining $350 million over the next several days, BI/MS said.    In addition to the bank financing, Morgan Stanley said it and other investors have committed to provide the remaining $861 million in bridge financing and equity capital.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
