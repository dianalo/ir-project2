We meet on democracy's front porch. A good place to talk asneighbors, and as friends. For this is a day when our nation is madewhole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   I come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich withpromise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make itbetter.   For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedomseems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of thedictator is over. The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideasblown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree.   A new breeze is blowing _ and a nation refreshed by freedomstands ready to push on: there is new ground to be broken, and newaction to be taken. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy _ throughthe door to freedom.   Men and women of the world move toward free markets _ through thedoor to prosperity.   The people of the world agitate for free expression and freethought _ through the door to the moral and intellectualsatisfactions that only liberty allows.   We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedomis right. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life forman on earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, andthe exercise of free will unhampered by the state. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   America today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil _ a placewe cannot help but love. We know in our hearts, not loudly andproudly, but as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyondwhat we see, and that our strength is a force for good.   But have we changed as nation, even in our time? Are weenthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobilityof work and sacrifice?   My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are notthe measure of our lives. In our hearts we know what matters. Wecannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bankaccount. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be aloyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, hisneighborhood and town better than he found it.   And what do we want the men and women who work with us to saywhen we're no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed thananyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child hadgotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word offriendship.   No president, no government, can teach us to remember what isbest in what we are. But if the man you have chosen to lead thisgovernment can help make a difference; if he can celebrate thequieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk, but ofbetter hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then hemust.   America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in highmoral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is tomake kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.   My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost androaming _ there are the children who have nothing, no love, nonormalcy _ there are those who cannot free themselves of enslavementto whatever addiction _ drugs, welfare, demoralization that rulesthe slums. There is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of thestreets. There are young women to be helped who are about to becomemothers of children they can't care for and might not love. Theyneed our care, our guidance, and education; though we bless them forchoosing life.   The old solution, the old way, was to think that public moneyalone could end these problems. But we have learned that that is notso. And in any case, our funds are low. We have a deficit to bringdown. We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need.   We will make the hard choices, looking at what we have, perhapsallocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest needand prudent safety.   And then we will do the wisest thing of all: we will turn to theonly resource we have that in times of need always grows: thegoodness and the courage of the American people.   And, I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others _ anew activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   And we must bring the federal budget into balance. And we mustensure that America stands before the world united: strong, atpeace, and fiscally sound. But, of course, things may be difficult....</TEXT><TEXT>   And our great parties have two often been far apart anduntrusting of each other.   It's been this way since Vietnam. That war cleaves us still. But,friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago; and,surely, the Statute of Limitations has been reached. This is a fact:The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long affordto be sundered by a memory.   A new breeze is blowing _ and the old bipartisanship must be madenew again. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   The American people await action. They didn't send us here tobicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. ``In crucialthings, unity'' _ and this, my friends, is crucial.   To the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: Wewill stay strong to protect the peace. The ``offered hand'' is areluctant fist; once made, strong and can be used with great effect.   There are today Americans who are held against their will inforeign lands, and Americans who are unaccounted for. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   While keeping our alliances and friendships around the worldstrong, ever strong, we will continue the new closeness with theSoviet Union, consistent both with our security and with progress.One might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumphof hope and strength over experience. But hope is good. And so isstrength. And vigilance. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise upunited and express our intolerance. And the most obvious now isdrugs. And when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it mayas well have been a deadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body,the soul of our country. And there is much to be done and to besaid, but take my word for it: This scourge will stop. ...</TEXT><TEXT>   Some see leadership as high drama, and the sound of trumpetscalling. And sometimes it is that. But I see history as a book withmany pages _ and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulnessand meaning.   The new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds _ and sotoday a chapter begins: a small and stately story of unity,diversity and generosity _ shared, and written, together.</TEXT><NOTE>End Bush Text-Excerpts _ 1 Take</NOTE></DOC>
