She's still fighting to be reinstated in the National HonorSociety. She was thrown out of the organization as a senior aftershe gave birth while unmarried, allegedly for not upholdingmembership criteria of character and leadership.   Now 23 and married, her case finally has reached a federalcourtroom in Pittsburgh. The non-jury trial opened Tuesday with hertaking the stand, claiming discrimination by Marion Center AreaSchool District officials.   Mrs. Kerner said she kept up the fight ``because I thought I wasright.''   ``As far as I was concerned,'' she said, ``I still had thecharacter and leadership that was necessary for membership, whetherI was a married mother or an unwed mother.''   Mrs. Kerner sued in early 1984 in U.S. District Court to regainher membership in the National Honor Society. The school districtis about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh.   Mrs. Kerner said teachers told her the two weeks of classes shemissed after having her baby affected her leadership abilities. Thefaculty took the action after giving her the opportunity to resign,an option she refused.   Mrs. Kerner testified honor society faculty advisers at herschool told her their decision ``would have been different'' if shehad been married. She said school officials refused to answer whenshe asked them if she'd have been dismissed had she obtained anabortion.   In his opening statement to U.S. District Judge Barron McCune,attorney Jay Y. Rubin said the school district treated his clientdifferently than it would have treated a male honor student. Rubintried to call as a witness a former Marion Center student who hadbeen allowed to remain a member of the National Honor Society eventhough he got a girl pregnant.   But McCune would not allow the man to testify, saying that caseoccurred two years after Mrs. Kerner had been dismissed. The judgesaid Mrs. Kerner's lawsuit might have affected the board's decision.   Martha H. Munsch, the attorney for Marion Center schools,attempted to show membership in the National Honor Society was notimportant to Mrs. Kerner. Ms. Munsch questioned Mrs. Kerner aboutmissing an honor society function in favor of cheerleading practice.   She said dismissal from the society did not prevent Mrs. Kernerfrom attending college or receiving scholarships. Mrs. Kernertestified she enrolled in college but withdrew after one daybecause her child took up too much time. She also said she neverapplied for scholarships or financial aid.</TEXT></DOC>
