No, it wasn't the latest episode of ``L.A. Law.'' But the twistsin the Wall Street insider trading scandal this past week could wellprovide some real-life fodder for Hollywood writers of the glitzytelevision series.   It began last Tuesday when politically ambitious Manhattan U.S.Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, architect of a massivesecurities-fraud crackdown over the past few years, announced he wasresigning at the end of the month.   Although Giuliani's departure was expected _ because of numerousdropped hints he might run for New York mayor _ it came at aparticularly crucial time in the Wall Street investigation for whichhe is largely responsible.   Giuliani will be leaving more than a half-dozen important casesunresolved, along with increasing acrimony over what defense lawyerscall his brutal and sometimes careless tactics.   Coincidentally, those tactics backfired on his assistants just asGiuliani was calling the press together at his downtown Manhattanoffice to say farewell.   Next door in federal court, a judge decreed a mistrial in thestock-manipulation case against GAF Corp. and a senior companyofficial, the first key prosecution to reach the trial phase in thescandal.   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe said prosecutors broke therules by failing to inform the defense that a key piece of evidencethey introduced may have been altered.   A federal appeals court sided with her in ordering a new trial,but warned the Giuliani aide handling the case: ``Don't withhold anymore evidence.''   The departure of Giuliani also signaled his evident failure toextract a plea bargain agreement from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'shigh-yield bond financier, Michael Milken, who has continued toassert his innocence although his employer capitulated last month.   Drexel, the biggest corporate target of Giuliani's crusade,agreed Dec. 21 to plead guilty to six unspecified felonies, pay arecord $650 million in fines and restitution, settle relatedlitigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and cooperatein the government's expanding fraud probes.   As part of a move to cleanse its sullied image, the firmannounced last Thursday it had offered the chairman's job to JohnShad, the former SEC chief who authorized the investigation thatensnared Drexel in the first place.   It wasn't clear by the end of the week whether the offer would beaccepted by Shad, who is now U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands. Buthe was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying any decision wassubject to ``favorable resolution'' of Drexel's legal problems.   In other business and economic news this past week:   _Government statistics suggested sharp rises in consumerspending, debt and inflation. The Federal Reserve said consumerborrowing swelled at an 8.2 percent annual rate in November, drivenby credit-card purchases; the Commerce Department said retailspending shot up 6.7 percent last year, the fastest growth in fouryears; and the Labor Department said wholesale prices rose 4 percentlast year, the highest rate since the early 1980s.   _Although the stock market appeared to be holding its own, thepost-crash uncertainty of the securities world was dramaticallydemonstrated by sharply different earnings situations at two of WallStreet's biggest firms. Bear Stearns Cos. reported the highestquarterly profits in history, while Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. saidit would suffer a quarterly loss, partly because of the tumblingvalue of its holdings in a troubled Texas bank, MCorp.   _President-elect Bush suggested he might propose tax changes thatwould make debt-financed takeovers less attractive, but there was noevident slowdown in the merger news that colored 1988. CookeCablevision Inc. and the New York Times Co. agreed to sell theircable TV operations in transactions totaling almost $2 billion; andWest Point-Pepperell Inc. reported sharply lower profits partlybecause of efforts to fight a $1.4 billion hostile takeover bid.   _Meanwhile on the cooked and and raw poultry fronts, a judgeruled Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken may resume a $290 milliontakeover attempt of rival Church's Fried Chicken; and Holly FarmsCorp. set Wednesday as the deadline for suitors Tyson Foods Inc. andConAgra Inc. to submit new offers in a $1 billion bidding struggle.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Jan. 14-15</NOTE></DOC>
