The 270-138 roll call, which limits new Contra aid to an estimated $3.5 million in nonlethal &quot;humanitarian&quot; assistance, reflects a bipartisan consensus that any vote on additional arms be postponed until the Central American peace plan takes effect Nov. 7.    A majority of both parties supported the measure, and in the aftermath of this week's visit by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez, leading conservatives softened their criticism of the peace effort. Such Republicans as Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich warmly praised Mr. Arias's performance in informal discussions with House members and portrayed him as a strong &quot;partner&quot; for the U.S. rather than the naive figure often painted by the political right.    The underlying stopgap bill buys an additional 40 days for the long-delayed federal appropriations process. With a week left before the start of fiscal 1988, Congress has yet to enact any of the 13 annual spending bills. Ten have cleared the House, but Senate action has been confined to the Appropriations Committee, which yesterday approved nearly $14.3 billion in fiscal 1988 spending for the State, Justice and Commerce departments.    The estimated $2.53 billion allocated to the State Department represents a 25% cut from President Reagan's request. The measure incorporates substantial legislative changes in the U.S. refugee program, affecting people trying to come to this country from Cuba and especially the Far East.    Among domestic programs, the Economic Development Administration would be preserved at close to its current level, and language was attached prohibiting the administration from proceeding with the planned sale of Small Business Administration loan assets.    The refugee provisions have far-reaching importance and reflect an effort by Sen. Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.) to prod the administration to expedite the processing of hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing Indochina. A minimum of 28,000 refugees would be permitted admission in each of the next three fiscal years, and the Senate committee adopted unusually strong language criticizing the Immigration and Naturalization Service's failure to meet similar U.S. commitments to countries such as Thailand, which have provided asylum to refugees.    The State, Justice and Commerce bill is the sixth to be cleared by the Senate panel, which earlier this week approved nearly $10 billion in fiscal 1988 appropriations for the Interior Department and various energy and forest programs. The measure allocates $350 million for so-called clean coal technology sought by the administration, and funds are provided to increase oil purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100,000 barrels a day by the middle of the new fiscal year.    A ban on oil exploration in waters off New England would be preserved, and new funding for roads in federal timberlands would be held to $145 million under a compromise negotiated with environmentalists and the lumber industry.    Timber interests, which won a prolonged battle last year, are weaker with the Democratic takeover of the Senate. Though promised $166 million in such spending for fiscal 1989, the $145 million figure is $21 million less than the president's request and $35 million below the current funding level.    Aside from Pentagon appropriations, the largest bill remaining for the Senate committee is an estimated $129.3 billion measure covering the Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services departments. As reported from subcommittee, the measure would raise discretionary spending in these accounts by $2.45 billion above the current year -- a 6.7% increase from the current year but more than 29% above the president's budget.    An estimated $946 million would be provided for programs and research related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, an 86% increase from fiscal 1987 funding. But the sharpest differences with the administration appear to come in education. Pell Grants to low-income college students would rise to $4.5 billion, or two-thirds above the president's request. Meanwhile, the total Education Department budget of nearly $21.2 billion would be 8.8% greater than the current year and more than $7 billion, or 50%, greater than the administration's proposal. </TEXT></DOC>
