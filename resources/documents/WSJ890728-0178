Representatives of Rengo no Kai, a political arm of the Japanese Private Sector Trade Union Confederation, or Rengo, won 11 seats in the upper-house parliamentary election on Sunday, defeating the candidates of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in all of the single-seat constituencies where Rengo put up candidates. The four major non-communist opposition parties cooperated by not running their own candidates against Rengo's in the 11 districts, but the extent of Rengo's triumph in the Diet vote still surprised analysts.    &quot;Rengo's emergence as a political force is one of the most important developments of the election,&quot; says Kent Calder, a professor at Princeton University and an expert on Japanese politics. Traditionally, Japan's unions lent their support to the Socialist Party, the Democratic Socialist Party or the Communist Party but had seldom run their own candidates.    The labor organization was set up two years ago with the merger of private-sector unions. Rengo said its aim was to strengthen labor's influence on the government and thus &quot;to realize Western European and U.S.-level living standards.&quot;    A spokesman for Rengo says the original policy of the confederation was to avoid getting too involved with politics. But he said it has become difficult to stay out of politics, given Rengo's expanding influence in Japan. &quot;{We} couldn't fulfill our responsibility if we hadn't been involved in the election at all,&quot; he says.    Rengo's thrust into politics is a roundabout way to help stop the slide of labor's influence in the workplace. The annual wage offensive, known as &quot;shunto,&quot; has been a fixture of Japanese labor relations since the mid-1950s, but management has had the upper hand in negotiations for about a decade. This spring, for example, despite record profits posted by many Japanese companies, the average wage increase granted was about 5%, only one percentage point higher than last year. The proportion of Japanese workers in unions has dropped to 27% from 56% in 1949.    Consequently, unions may be hoping to achieve through the political process what they've been unable to accomplish through negotiations with management. And Rengo's influence could grow. Government and other public-sector unions are scheduled to join the labor organization this fall, boosting Rengo's membership to more than eight million and giving Rengo control of all unionized workers except those affiliated with Japan's Communist Party.    Analysts say they aren't sure how much success Rengo no Kai, the political arm, will have in future elections, though. That's partly because the new quasi-party has yet to clearly define its policy aims. Shoichi Nakagawa, a Diet member who belongs to the LDP, says, &quot;{We} don't know what Rengo wants to do but as far as their young members are concerned, there isn't much difference in philosophy from ours. As they aren't supporters of Marxism, we can talk with them.&quot;    Instead of focusing on policies, Rengo explains its role mainly in tactical terms, saying it wants to coordinate policies among opposition parties. And indeed, political analysts say Rengo could have a considerable impact on Japanese politics as the &quot;glue&quot; holding the non-communist opposition parties together.    Hideo Yamauchi, professor at Keio University in Tokyo, says Rengo is &quot;a new breed of political group that is not conservative and not reformist, pursuing efficacy so it can be an adhesive to tie up various political parties.&quot;    Even in that role, however, analysts say it's too early to judge how much contribution Rengo can make. Kaoru Okano, a professor at Meiji University in Tokyo, says if Rengo doesn't secure seats in the lower house of parliament in the next election, its political infuence will be diluted. </TEXT></DOC>
