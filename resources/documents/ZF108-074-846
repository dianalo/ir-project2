Carabello said the courses are available to programmanagers of automated information systems (AIS) valued at $100 million ormore.andM;The courses were developed last fall in a two-phase process that began withpresentations to experienced DOD officials and included &quot;dry runs&quot; presentedto active program managers.andM;The three new AIS courses are life cycle management, planning and preparationfor major AIS review council (MAISRC) action, and development of functionalrequirements and concepts for systems.andM;Carabello said the courses are structured around a series of lectures and theexamination through simulated program management of case studies drawn fromactual systems.andM;A division of the National Defense University in Washington, DODCI wasestablished in 1964 primarily to teach computer basics.andP;  In November 1988,DOD officials directed the school to upgrade its orientation so that programmanagers for automated systems and their staffs would have access to whatCarabello called a professional curriculum at a graduate level.andM;Case StudiesandM;Carabello said the courses will provide program managers with fundamentals insuch core management issues as design, development, acquisition, fielding,operation and maintenance of systems.andP;  The managers work on case studies ofmodel development schemes.andP;  Students have to contend with cost, schedule andperformance problems, just as they might when developing a real system.andM;The need for such formal training emerged because &quot;DOD has become morecommitted to information systems,&quot; Carabello said.andP;  He said a major systemfaces as many as six or seven oversight reviews from such bodies as agencyreview councils, the DOD Major Automated Information Systems Review Council,the House Appropriations and Government Operations committees, the GeneralServices Administration and the General Accounting Office.andM;&quot;Any player in the milestone program can kill a program with a single 'no,'but it takes a consensus of approval from all of them to keep you going,&quot;Carabello said.andP;  &quot;A PM of a major system faces worse odds than a horse playerdoes at the racetrack.&quot;andM;He said political and management savvy are the crucial skills for asuccessful program manager, followed by technical fluency.andP;  The currentgeneration of Defense Department PMs was surveyed before the institutedesigned the new courses.andP;  The institute has added instructors with AISexperience to the DODCI faculty, which has about 40 members, he said.andM;DODCI's management program will be fully operational next fall, Carabellosaid, when four more courses will be added to the curriculum and the name ofthe school will change.andM;At that point, PM staff members also will be eligible to take the courses.andO;The four courses to begin in the fall cover system acquisition and costcontrol, information system security and decision support systems.andM;Discussing why the current program is offered only to managers of largerprograms, Carabello said, &quot;We presume a great deal of knowledge on thestudent's part.andP;  The program is for people who already have a few knots ontheir heads.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
