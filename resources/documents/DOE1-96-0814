Areas discussed include cycled mass transfer processes, three-phaseliquid extraction, fines removal from suspended submicron particles,adsorption with variable pressure, crystallization from flowing liquidfilms, extraction by dense gases, combined processes, the applicationof electric fields, addition of surfactants and new hydrodynamic regimes.The authors discuss membrane distillation as the membrane separationtechnique in which the driving force is a temperature gradient. Membranedistillation incurs small energy costs and its applications include theproduction of boiler water, the desalination of sea water using the wasteheat from diesel boilers, power stations, or solar energy, the concentrationof product solutions, and the combination of concentration and productionof desalinated water for industrial use.</TEXT></DOC>
