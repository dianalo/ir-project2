Amended systems notices have been published in proposed formelsewhere in today's issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), information maintained in the twosystems of records of OIG is exempt from all provisions of the PrivacyAct of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended, except subsections (b), (c) (1)and (2), (e)(4) (A) through (F), (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and(i), to the extent that information in the systems pertains to criminallaw enforcement. This includes, but is not limited to, information compiledfor the purpose of identifying criminal offenders and alleged offendersand consisting of identifying data and notations of arrests, the natureand disposition of criminal charges, sentencing, confinement, release,and parole and probation status; information compiled for the purpose ofa criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators,that is associated with an identifiable individual; or reports of enforcementof the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from supervision.The disclosure of information contained in the criminal investigative files,including the names of persons or agencies to whom the information hasbeen transmitted, would substantially compromise the effectiveness of OIGinvestigations. Knowledge of such investigations could enable suspectsto take such action as is necessary to prevent detection of criminal activities,conceal or destroy evidence, or escape prosecution. Disclosure of thisinformation could lead to the intimidation of, or harm to, informants,witnesses, and their families, and could jeopardize the safety and well-beingof investigative and related personnel and their families. The impositionof certain restrictions on the manner in which investigative informationis collected, verified, or retained would significantly impede the effectivenessof OIG investigatory activities, and in addition could preclude the apprehensionand successful prosecution of persons engaged in fraud or criminal activity.Information in these systems is maintained pursuant to official Federallaw enforcement and criminal investigation functions of the Office of InspectorGeneral. The exemptions are needed to maintain the integrity and confidentialityof criminal investigations, to protect individuals from harm, and for thefollowing reasons:(1) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make the accounting of eachdisclosure of records available to the individual named in the record athis/her request. These accountings must state the date, nature, and purposeof each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient.Accounting for each disclosure would alert the subjects of an investigationto the existence of the investigation and the fact that they are subjectsof the investigation. The release of such information to the subjects ofan investigation would provide them with significant information concerningthe nature of the investigation, and could seriously impede or compromisethe investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources,witnesses, law enforcement personnel and their families, and lead to theimproper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or thefabrication of testimony.(2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or otheragency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency inaccordance with subsection (d) of the Act. Since these systems of recordsare being exempted from subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access torecords, this section is inapplicable to the extent that these systemsof records will be exempted from subsection (d) of the Act.(3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) requires an agency to permit an individual to gainaccess to records pertaining to him/her, to request amendment to such records,to request a review of an agency decision not to amend such records, andto contest the information contained in such records. Granting access torecords in these systems of records could inform the subject of an investigationof an actual or potential criminal violation of the existence of that investigation,of the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as tohis/her activities, of the identity of confidential sources, witnesses,and law enforcement personnel, and could provide information to enablethe subject to avoid detection or apprehension. Granting access to suchinformation could seriously impede or compromise an investigation, endangerthe physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, law enforcementpersonnel and their families, lead to the improper influencing of witnesses,the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony, and discloseinvestigative techniques and procedures. In addition, granting access tosuch information could disclose classified, security-sensitive, or confidentialbusiness information and could constitute an unwarranted invasion of thepersonal privacy of others.(4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its recordsonly such information about an individual as is relevant and necessaryto accomplish a purpose of the agency required by statute or by executiveorder of the President. The application of this provision could impairinvestigations and law enforcement because it is not always possible todetect the relevance or necessity of specific information in the earlystages of an investigation. Relevance and necessity are often questionsof judgment and timing, and it is only after the information is evaluatedthat the relevance and necessity of such information can be established.In addition, during the course of the investigation, the investigator mayobtain information which is incidental to the main purpose of the investigationbut which may relate to matters under the investigative jurisdiction ofanother agency. Such information cannot readily be segregated. Furthermore,during the course of the investigation, the investigator may obtain informationconcerning the violation of laws other than those which are within thescope of his/her jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement,OIG investigators should retain this information, since it can aid in establishingpatterns of criminal activity and can provide valuable leads for otherlaw enforcement agencies. (5) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to thegreatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when theinformation may result in adverse determinations about an individual'srights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. The applicationof this provision could impair investigations and law enforcement by alertingthe subject of an investigation of the existence of the investigation,thereby enabling the subject to avoid detection or apprehension, to influencewitnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Moreover,in certain circumstances the subject of an investigation cannot be requiredto provide information to investigators, and information must be collectedfrom other sources. Furthermore, it is often necessary to collect informationfrom sources other than the subject of the investigation to verify theaccuracy of the evidence collected. (6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person whom itasks to supply information, on a form that can be retained by the person,of the authority under which the information is sought and whether disclosureis mandatory or voluntary; of the principal purposes for which the informationis intended to be used; of the routine uses which may be made of the information;and of the effects on the person, if any, of not providing all or any partof the requested information. The application of this provision could providethe subject of an investigation with substantial information about thenature of that investigation, which could interfere with the investigation.Moreover, providing such a notice to the subject of an investigation couldseriously impede or compromise an undercover investigation by revealingits existence and could endanger the physical safety of confidential sources,witnesses, and investigators by revealing their identities. (7) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (H) require an agency to publish a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice concerning its procedures for notifyingan individual, at his/her request, if the system of records contains arecord pertaining to him/her, how to gain access to such a record, andhow to contest its content. Since these systems of records are being exemptedfrom subsection (f) of the Act, concerning agency rules, and subsection(d) of the Act, concerning access to records, these requirements are inapplicableto the extent that these systems of records will be exempted from subsection(f) and (d) of the Act. Although the systems would be exempt from theserequirements, OIG has published information concerning its notification,access, and contest procedures because, under certain circumstances, OIGcould decide it is appropriate for an individual to have access to allor a portion of his/her records in these systems of records. (8) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(I) requires an agency to publish a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice concerning the categories of sources ofrecords in the system of records. Exemption from this provision is necessaryto protect the confidentiality of the sources of information, to protectthe privacy and physical safety of confidential sources and witnesses,and to avoid the disclosure of investigative techniques and procedures.Although the systems will be exempt from this requirement, OIG has publishedsuch a notice in broad generic terms. (9) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records withsuch accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonablynecessary to assure fairness to the individual in making any determinationabout the individual. Since the Act defines ``maintain'' to include thecollection of information, complying with this provision could preventthe collection of any data not shown to be accurate, relevant, timely,and complete at the moment it is collected. In collecting information forcriminal law enforcement purposes, it is not possible to determine in advancewhat information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Facts arefirst gathered and then placed into a logical order to prove or disproveobjectively the criminal behavior of an individual. Material which seemsunrelated, irrelevant, or incomplete when collected can take on added meaningor significance as the investigation progresses. The restrictions of thisprovision could interfere with the preparation of a complete investigativereport, thereby impeding effective law enforcement.(10) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable effortsto serve notice on an individual when any record on such individual ismade available to any person under compulsory legal process when such processbecomes a matter of public record. Complying with this provision couldprematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject ofthe investigation. (11) 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(1) requires an agency to promulgate rules which shallestablish procedures whereby an individual can be notified in responseto his/her request if any system of records named by the individual containa record pertaining to him/her. The application of this provision couldimpede or compromise an investigation or prosecution if the subject ofan investigation were able to use such rules to learn of the existenceof an investigation before it could be completed. In addition, mere noticeof the fact of an investigation could inform the subject and others thattheir activities are under or may become the subject of an investigationand could enable the subjects to avoid detection or apprehension, to influencewitnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Sincethese systems would be exempt from subsection (d) of the Act, concerningaccess to records, the requirements of subsection (f)(2) through (5) ofthe Act, concerning agency rules for obtaining access to such records,are inapplicable to the extent that these systems of records will be exemptedfrom subsection (d) of the Act. Although these systems would be exemptfrom the requirements of subsection (f) of the Act, OIG has promulgatedrules which establish Agency procedures because, under certain circumstances,it could be appropriate for an individual to have access to all or a portionof his/her records in these systems of records.(12) 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) provides for civil remedies if an agency fails tocomply with the requirements concerning access to records under subsections(d) (1) and (3) of the Act; maintenance of records under subsection (e)(5)of the Act; and any other provision of the Act, or any rule promulgatedthereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.Since these systems of records would be exempt from subsections (c)(3)and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2), (3), and (4)(G) and (H), (e)(1) through (5)and (8), and (f) of the Act, the provisions of subsection (g) of the Actwould be inapplicable to the extent that these systems of records willbe exempted from those subsections of the Act.Under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the head of any agency may by rule exempt anysystem of records within the agency from certain provisions of the PrivacyAct of 1974, if the system of records is maintained by an agency or componentthereof which performs as its principal function any activity pertainingto the enforcement of criminal laws and which consists of:(1) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual criminaloffenders and alleged offenders and consisting only of identifying dataand notations of arrests, the nature and disposition of criminal charges,sentencing, confinement, release, and parole and probation status; (2) Information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, includingreports of informants and investigators, and associated with an identifiableindividual; or(3) Reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of theprocess of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or indictment throughrelease from supervision.USDA/OIG-2 and USDA/OIG-3 contain information of the type described aboveand are maintained by the Office of Inspector General, a component of USDAwhich performs as one of its principal functions activities pertainingto the enforcement of criminal laws. Authority for the criminal law enforcementactivities of the Office of Inspector General is the Inspector GeneralAct of 1978, 5 U.S.C. app. 3. That legislation authorizes the Office ofInspector General to conduct investigations relating to programs and operationsof the Department of Agriculture.This proposed rule has been reviewed under Departmental Regulations 1512-1and Executive Order No. 12291 and has been determined not to be a ``majorrule'' since it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more.In addition, it has been determined that this proposed rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1</ITAG>Privacy Act.For the reasons set out in the preamble, it is proposed to amend 7 CFR,Subtitle A, Part 1, Subpart G, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart G_Privacy Act Regulations</ITAG>1.
