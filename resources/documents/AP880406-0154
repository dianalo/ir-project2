Gorbachev flew to the Central Asiancity of Tashkent under unusually tight security Wednesday to meetwith Afghan leader Najib, apparently to work out a Soviet troopwithdrawal from Afghanistan.   The official Tass news agency reported that Gorbachev leftMoscow in midafternoon, but waited more than six hours beforeannouncing that he would meet with Najib. No other details wereprovided, and even Soviet photographers were not allowed to coverthe departure or arrival of Gorbachev's plane.   Also flying to Tashkent was Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze, who had been in Kabul for the past four days to workout a plan to pull out Soviet troops in the event that formalnegotiations in Geneva fail to produce an accord to end the10-year-old war.   Tass said Shevardnadze and Najib flew to Tashkent after theirtalks, but the wording suggested they traveled separately.   Tashkent, capital of the Uzbek republic, is about 450 milesnorth of Kabul and about 1,700 miles southeast of Moscow.   The unusual meeting place apparently was a compromise onprotocol, which would make it unsuitable for Najib, who is head ofstate as well as party leader, to be summoned to Moscow for talkswith Gorbachev.   Security concerns would prohibit Gorbachev from traveling toAfghanistan, where guerrillas have used their U.S.-supplied Stingermissiles to shoot planes out of the sky.   Guerrillas aided by Pakistan and the United States have beenfighting the Kremlin-backed Kabul government since an April 1978revolution brought communists to power in the Moslem state.   The current round of the U.N.-mediated Geneva talks, which beganon March 2, has been stalled by a disagreement between negotiatorsfor Afghanistan and Pakistan, which represents the insurgents atthe talks, over continued foreign aid to the warring sides.   The United Staes contends that if the Geneva accords call for anend to American military aid to the guerrillas when the Sovietpullout begins, the Kremlin also should have to halt arms suppliesto the Kabul government.   Soviet officials claim aid to Afghanistan is a bilateral issueoutside the range of the Geneva talks.   While the Americans are not officially represented at thenegotiations, their refusal to go along with the terms of a peaceagreement could render it ineffective.   Diego Cordovez, the U.N. mediator at the Geneva talks, toldreporters he is still awaiting a response from Moscow andAfghanistan on the aid issue. Progress at the latest round of talkshas been ``slow but steady,'' he said.   A member of the Pakistani delegation said ``all parties agreethey are near agreement,'' while another diplomatic sourcecautioned it was ``a little premature'' to consider the superpowerstandoff settled. Both spoke on condition of anonymity.   U.S. and Pakistani officials said publicly Tuesday that aresolution may be only days away.   Shevardnadze flew to Kabul on Sunday and told Tass upon arrivalthat the United States and Pakistan had frustrated the Geneva talksby insisting on ``symmetry'' _ the simultaneous cutoff by bothsuperpowers of assistance to the Afghan combatants.   In New Delhi, India on Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary FrankCarlucci renewed the call for ``symmetry.'' He told a newsconference before flying to Islamabad, Pakistan, that the Sovietshave so far rejected the American proposal for such a moritorium.   ``We are exploring other options,'' he said, but gave no details.   Gorbachev said Feb. 8 that if the Geneva agreement was signed byMarch 15, Soviet soldiers would start pulling out May 15. He alsosaid the withdrawal could be completed within nine months, withmost of the Soviet soldiers removed within three months.   While the deadline has passed, Soviet officials have assertedthe troop pullout will begin this year anyway, with or without aGeneva agreement.   Shevardnadze said Sunday he would work out the details of thepullout, focusing on Afghan and Soviet concerns, in case the Genevaprocess fails.   Gorbachev's meeting with Najib may have been necessary becauseof disagreements between the two governments over terms of theSoviet withdrawal.   While Najib's leadership is closely allied with the Kremlin,there are likely sharp differences over how and when to reduce theSoviet fighting power while protecting Afghan officials from abloody takeover by the guerrillas.   Soviet soldiers entered the war on Dec. 27, 1979, and anestimated 115,000 remain in Afghanistan to help Najib's army fightoff the insurgents.   At a news conference earlier Wednesday, Deputy Foreign MinisterVladimir F. Petrovsky said that a pullout would begin two monthsafter completion of an agreement in Geneva, but noted that theterms could be revised if the troops are to be withdrawn under aSoviet-Afghan pact.   Petrovsky refused to disclose details of the four days of talksbetween Shevardnadze and Najib.   While in Islamabad, Carlucci is to meet with Pakistan PresidentMohammad Zia ul-Haq and Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo, anddiscuss aid to the guerrillas. On Thursday, he is to fly byhelicopter to the Khyber Pass, the gateway to Afghanistan 185 mileswest of Islamabad.</TEXT></DOC>
