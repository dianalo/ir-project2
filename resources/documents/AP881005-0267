The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, rose 1 cent Tuesday to settle at $13.07 a barrel on theNew York Mercantile Exchange.   The contract skidded 86 cents over Friday and Monday to $13.06 abarrel, the lowest close for a near-term WTI contract since August1986.   Concerns about oversupply of crude have brought prices down byabout $2 a barrel over the past five weeks. Those concerns wereheightened Monday by Saudi Arabia's threat to step up its crudeoutput unless other members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries abide by their OPEC production quotas.   Oil prices opened higher Tuesday amid rumors that OPEC wouldmove its ministerial meeting, scheduled for November, up to laterthis month, said John Azarow, a trader with Shearson Lehman HuttonInc.   An early meeting raises speculation over the prospect of anagreement among OPEC members to rein in the cartel's production.   But the rally, which analysts said was based on technicalfactors, soon ran out of steam. The November crude contract went ashigh as $13.30 a barrel before slipping back.   ``We're still in a bear market,'' said Jim Fiedler, a traderwith E.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc. ``The market wasexpecting a rally of up to the $13.70 level and they haven't beenable to get it.''   Besides OPEC rumors, there was no news to affect trading,analysts said.   ``The main thing goes back to the concerns about the Saudioverproduction,'' Fiedler said.   Among refined products traded on the Mercantile Exchange, theNovember contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.87 cent to41.11 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 0.39 cent to38.17 cents a gallon.   Azarow said some of the movement in refined products was due toseasonal factors, such as a decline in driving that lowers demandfor gas and the onset of cooler weather that increases heating oiluse.</TEXT></DOC>
