It has been found thatPd(II) halides are the most effective in the synthesis of {beta}-haloalkylalkyl ethers. Reactivity decreases in the sequence: ethylene andgt; propyleneandgt; 1-hexene andgt; cyclohexene. It has been shown that the presence of Cu(II)halides in the catalyst solution is necessary for the formation of {beta}-haloalkylalkyl ethers. The part played by the oxidant is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
