In recent weeks, the dollar has seen a re-emergence of the feverish bullish sentiment that propelled it during the early summer.    But currency analysts say a climb could be rougher this time because U.S. interest rates, while still seen as attractive, are below the level of a month ago. Also, there are persistent concerns that central banks will pounce on the dollar with heavy sales when they perceive the timing is right.    The dollar &quot;doesn't have the same feel to it this time around. I see a little bit more of a seesaw type movement&quot; as it works its way higher, says Douglas Madison, a corporate trader at Bank of America in Los Angeles.    Hubert Pedroli, manager of foreign exchange dealings at Credit Suisse, says, &quot;It's going to be much slower this time&quot; on the upside.    The dollar has the potential to rise as high as 1.98 marks and 144 yen this week, but it wouldn't be surprising to see a test of support at 1.95 marks and 141.50 yen at some point, contends Mr. Pedroli.    Backing the dollar, traders say, is evidence of continued strength in the U.S. economy and news of the unexpectedly narrow $8.17 billion U.S. merchandise trade deficit in June.    In late trading here Friday, the dollar stood at 1.9563 marks and 142.60 yen, off on profit-taking from 1.9647 marks and 143.53 yen late Thursday. But since the beginning of the month, the dollar has risen more than 10 pfennigs and six yen.    In early Monday trading in Tokyo, the dollar was little changed, but had managed to hold on to gains in early Asian trading. The dollar rose from late New York levels, but buying interest dried up after the dollar reached 143 yen.    As far as U.S. interest rates go, there will be a particularly close watch on rates this week because the Federal Open Market Committee meets tomorrow.    The committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, is expected to leave the central bank's monetary policy unchanged for now. But several U.S. administration officials have made it clear that they would favor another easing of credit by the Fed to avoid a recession.    Many analysts believe the Fed will resist the wishes of the administration, choosing instead to leave its policy steady and continue a gradual easing process that will encourage growth and keep inflation in check. Some see the administration's call for lower rates as a move to avoid being blamed for any recession, rather than a serious attempt to influence Fed policy.    The Federal Reserve probably &quot;doesn't want to tamper with what it has already set in motion,&quot; asserts Roger Shields, chief international economist at Chemical Bank.    The Fed, contends Mr. Shields, is cautious about loosening credit too swiftly because &quot;there seems to be some underlying strength that keeps us away from that recession door.&quot; Also, &quot;Inflation is still a bugaboo,&quot; he says.    As reported Friday, the U.S. consumer price index rose 0.2% last month, following a similar rise in June. The latest data were in line with expectations, but many economists note that the index rose 0.4% in July excluding food and energy, a rise that indicates inflation may still be a problem.    The Fed probably will leave the closely watched federal funds rate around its perceived median at 9% for now, after letting it slip from 9 3/4% in early June, many economists say. The fed funds rate is the rate charged on overnight reserves traded among commercial banks.    The course of U.S. rates is an important influence on the dollar because it helps determine the appetite for dollar-denominated investments.    There are few expectations for a near-term Fed easing, but if the Fed were to surprise the market and loosen credit, traders say the dollar would be in danger.    &quot;If Fed funds eased down to 8 3/4%, the dollar would come under some pressure,&quot; says Louis Quilici, an investment officer at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank in Chicago.    But even if the dollar slid in such a situation, Mr. Quilici doesn't envision a decisive fall below strong support at 1.90 marks and 140.50 yen in the near future.    A possible hurdle to more big dollar gains is the expectation that global central banks will try to slap the dollar lower with sales before it has a chance to hop over resistance at 2.0 marks. Many traders are especially concerned that the Bank of Japan &quot;may come out swinging&quot; with heavy sales, says Mr. Madison of Bank of America.    There are estimates that the Bank of Japan spent more than $6 billion in June to foil the dollar's rally, and some Japanese officials have warned the central bank is ready to act again if the dollar's strength is seen as excessive.    Last week, though, central banks left the market guessing about their plans. There were scattered rumors about intervention by the Bank of Japan and the Fed on several days, but there wasn't any action like the wave of coordinated sales Aug. 11.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $368.10 an ounce, down 20 cents. Estimated volume was a light 2.2 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $365.70 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
