Dismemberment of the nation's 11th-largest bank holding company would be jarring to its employees, to the community here and to the banking industry. But some First Chicago executives see a persuasive argument for breakup. An auction of First Chicago's many valuable businesses could fetch $3.5 billion, or about $63 a share -- more than three times its current market value.    At least for the time being, says First Chicago's chairman and chief executive officer, Barry F. Sullivan, the company isn't planning a breakup or any other dramatic move to bring shareholders an immediate reward. But that hasn't stopped the debate at First Chicago, a debate that reflects wrenching changes under way in the once-staid world of banking.    Like manufacturers over the past decade, banks now face the threat of a hostile takeover if their stock prices lag. Regulators in an era of deregulation look more favorably on bank mergers, and more states are removing their barriers to interstate acquisitions. Consolidation in the industry, only just begun, is expected to accelerate.    So far, no large bank has been the victim of an unfriendly takeover. But the watershed could be Bank of New York Co.'s hostile $1.25 billion offer for Irving Bank Corp., long considered rich in asset value but short on profits. Should regulators allow the bid to proceed, bankers say, a string of hostile attempts to take over big banks would follow.    In anticipation of that, bankers are weighing strategies previously unheard of in their industry. Some are going through painful restructurings -- selling prized businesses, firing workers, shutting down marginal operations -- to raise their stock prices. A restructuring was recently announced, for instance, by First Interstate Bancorp. The Los Angeles company says it fears being taken over cheaply and dismembered at a huge profit.    Security Pacific Corp., also based in Los Angeles, says it is considering spinning off pieces of some of its nonbanking units in hopes that investors would then place a higher value on its stock. Marine Corp. of Milwaukee recently fled into the arms of a white knight, Banc One Corp., to escape a hostile bid from Marshall andamp; Ilsley Corp. And dozens of big regional banks in the Southeast, the Northeast and the Midwest, seeing the handwriting on the wall, have agreed to be taken over in friendly deals.    Meanwhile, investment bankers and Wall Street lawyers smell blood. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, a law firm that advises many corporate takeover targets, including Irving Bank, is recommending that banks adopt so-called poison-pill defenses -- tactics designed to make a takeover prohibitively expensive -- before it is too late.    &quot;Hostile takeovers will no longer be the exception,&quot; the firm warned clients in an Oct. 27 memo.    It is unlikely that bank takeovers will ever be as rapid as acquisitions of manufacturing concerns. The review time required by the Federal Reserve Board and other regulators can take months. Banking laws largely prohibit commercial firms from buying banks. And banks can't be bought with mostly borrowed money; the Fed likes to see a solid base of unencumbered capital beneath a financial institution -- not a pile of junk bonds.    October's stock-market crash may nonetheless encourage takeover attempts. Stock prices are low, yet profits among big banks are rising. First Chicago stock closed yesterday at $20.25, or only about four times the expected 1988 per-share profits.    At that price, First Chicago looks like banking's version of Beatrice Cos., the food and consumer-products concern bought in 1986 for $6.2 billion and dealt off in pieces for an expected profit of more than $2 billion. Which is why First Chicago is among the banks thinking the unthinkable these days. If you're trying to avoid a takeover, breaking yourself up beats just sitting there being a fantastic bargain.    The idea of a breakup of First Chicago was first discussed among its top officers last July, at the company's annual strategic planning session. Three groups of executives presented plans. The first two plans were the usual stuff -- some cost-cutting here, a little repositioning there. But the third group's plan was sharply different: Sell it all off.    The proposal exposed a split between First Chicago executives, with a &quot;Draconian&quot; camp favoring drastic action -- selling all or part of the company -- and another camp guarding the status quo. So upsetting was the breakup proposal to some executives that &quot;we had guys practically throwing up at dinner,&quot; a breakup advocate recalls. But to others the logic seemed compelling. Says the breakup advocate, alluding to First Chicago's rank among bank holding companies: &quot;In a consolidating industry, you don't pick No. 11 to survive.&quot;    Mr. Sullivan won't discuss the inside projections of First Chicago's breakup value. Other executives, though, say the company could raise close to $2.5 billion by selling five businesses: a venture-capital fund; a huge MasterCard and Visa operation; an investment-management business; a leasing business; and a smaller Chicago bank, American National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago.    Or even better, some say, keep those and sell all or part of the main subsidiary, First National Bank of Chicago, which could bring $1 billion. &quot;That would make a lot more sense,&quot; says Chris Kotowski, a banking analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co. who has studied First Chicago's breakup value. The company's headquarters building and its pension fund also could be tapped for cash.    The 57-year-old Mr. Sullivan is a highly analytical man, often just as interested in discussing the business as in running it. He hasn't discouraged the breakup talk. But his favorite plan for enhancing First Chicago's value is to acquire rival Continental Illinois Corp. Mr. Sullivan won't discuss that, but subordinates and directors say that since Continental's 1984 government bailout, he has repeatedly said that a merger of the two big Chicago banks would make sense.    Last year he again had his staff &quot;doing the numbers&quot; on Continental. Such a huge combination would make First Chicago virtually takeover-proof, though it would face resistance from Continental and possibly its controlling shareholder, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., as well as from other banking regulators.    Mr. Sullivan's immediate plan is to try to get profits -- and stock price -- up sharply before Dec. 1, 1990, when Illinois opens its borders to all out-of-state bidders (currently, only banks in contiguous states can bid). &quot;We want to play the 1988-89 string out,&quot; he says. Breakup, he asserts, would mean forgoing the added value that he and his management team bring to the company.    But under Mr. Sullivan's management, First Chicago's stock price has been depressed and the company has sometimes seemed out of control. A huge batch of loans unexpectedly went bad in late 1984, and the Securities and Exchange Commission later forced the bank to restate its 1983 and 1984 results. In 1985, First Chicago threw its support behind a Brazilian bank in which it owned a stake only to find out weeks later that nearly all the bank's loans were bad. A $15.8 million investment turned into a $131 million loss. After that episode, banking regulators questioned Mr. Sullivan's competence, but First Chicago's board stood behind him.    First Chicago came close to being burned again last year. It agreed to pay $200 million for a 35% stake in a Canadian securities firm, Wood Gundy Corp. Analysts were already calling the price too steep, and then the stock market crashed. Still, two days after the crash, in an interview, Mr. Sullivan defended the proposed investment. &quot;They're in fine shape,&quot; he said.    But they weren't. Just a week later, Wood Gundy's underwriting losses from the British Petroleum Co. stock offering became known. First Chicago began backpedaling. It said it was rethinking the investment, and on Dec. 28 the deal was called off.    &quot;Each time they seem to have gotten on track,&quot; says a First Chicago board member, &quot;something comes up.&quot; The result is that First Chicago has performed like the Rodney Dangerfield of bank stocks, lagging behind upturns, leading declines and leaving itself very vulnerable.    Investors are asking, Mr. Sullivan concedes, &quot;Do these guys really know what they're doing?&quot;    After seven years on the job, he says, he has toughened considerably and is ready to take bold action to increase the price of First Chicago's stock. No more small steps, he says. His new motto: &quot;Incrementalism is the enemy.&quot; Last summer he slashed overseas offices, laying off more than 300 employees. The move meant an up-front charge against earnings of more than $30 million but will save at least $20 million a year.    Some subordinates, long impatient for change at First Chicago, are cheered. &quot;He used to be the biggest incrementalist who stalked the earth,&quot; one executive says. &quot;Barry has switched over -- a conversion of amazing magnitude.&quot; But others remain unconvinced. They note that in 1986, just a year earlier, Mr. Sullivan rejected the plan to close foreign offices after a tie vote between the Draconian forces and the backers of the status quo. &quot;My dog could have made that decision three years ago,&quot; complains a member of the Draconian camp.    Vice Chairman William J. McDonough, a former State Department official and now the peacekeeper between First Chicago's two executive camps, smooths it all over this way: &quot;A traumatic decision in 1986 became a no-brainer in 1987.&quot;    First Chicago no longer has the luxury of time to make such decisions. &quot;We have to have a higher urgency in building shareholder value,&quot; Mr. Sullivan says. &quot;That's the lesson of the takeover phenomenon.&quot; He wants to quickly bring the First National Bank unit up to the high profit level of the other businesses, hoping that the stock market will then pay a premium over breakup value for First Chicago shares. That means buying his argument -- &quot;synergy&quot; -- that the pieces are worth more together than apart.    &quot;Now,&quot; Mr. McDonough says, &quot;it's valued at less than the sum of the parts.&quot; First National &quot;is what we need to get fixed. Only then is the synergy argument not {garbage}.&quot;    As a last resort, would First Chicago break itself up to avoid being gobbled up? &quot;We've done a lot of analysis of it,&quot; Mr. McDonough says. &quot;We're not afraid of it. We don't have any hangups.&quot;    Shareholders, including the company's well-stock-optioned executives, would fare nicely. But many of First Chicago's 14,000 workers would lose their jobs, the Midwest would lose its biggest financial institution, and Chicago would lose one of its most generous corporate benefactors. Since moving here from New York, Mr. Sullivan has immersed himself in community work, joining the University of Chicago and Art Institute boards, charities and civic commissions.    &quot;It wouldn't be too popular for the guy from New York to come in and sell off the whole bank,&quot; a subordinate says. &quot;I don't think Barry wants that to happen on his watch. He'd get thrown off the Stadium Commission.&quot;    ---            Breakup: Major First Chicago Units              And What They Could Be Sold For                                                 POTENTIAL                                                   PRICE           UNIT/DESCRIPTION                    (In millions) Venture-capital group                            $560-900    One of biggest venture funds in U.S.,    investments at book value of $476 million    on Sept. 30 Credit-card operation                            $525-800    Third-largest U.S. issuer of Visa and    MasterCard with 4.5 million accounts,    $4.5 billion in loans First Chicago Investment Advisers                $125-150    Manages $10 billion of institutional funds First Chicago Leasing Corp.                      $200    Handles $1 billion annually in leases American National Bank andamp; Trust Co.               $500-700    Chicago lender to small-to-medium-sized    firms, Sept. 30 equity of $295.0 million,    nine-month profits $34.2 million First National Bank of Chicago                   $1,000    Tenth-largest U.S. bank, Sept. 30 equity    $916 million, assets $36.2 billion                                           Total: $2.9-$3.75                                                    billion</TEXT></DOC>
