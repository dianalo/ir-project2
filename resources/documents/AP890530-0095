More than 1,500 people have been arrested nationwide in fivedays of unrest, according to reports from officials in majorcities. Many of the looters were women and children caught eatingin supermarkets and fleeing with food.   At least three people were killed Monday during looting andriots in the northern city of Rosario, the nation's third-largestcity and scene of the worst violence, the government news agencyTelam said.   ``I had a shotgun and had prepared a system to electrify thedoors,'' one shopkeeper in Rosario, Pablo Davola, told the NoticiasArgentinas news agency. But when looters came in, ``there were manypeople I knew, people from the neighborhood,'' he said.   Police said about 750 people were arrested and 41 were injuredin Rosario. Another 500 were arrested in working class suburbs ofBuenos Aires.   Alfonsin declared a 30-day state of siege Monday night. Theorder suspends civil liberties in an attempt to end unrest bypeople angered by soaring inflation, rising unemployment, adevalued currency and shrunken wages.   The Alfonsin government, which replaced a military dictatorship,``had no alternative than this measure to preserve order andguarantee the property and liberty of citizens,'' said InteriorMinister Juan Carlos Pugliese.   Most of the capital's businesses were closed today and someshopkeepers barricaded their stores. Schools, closed Monday,remained shut, and public transportation was scarce.   Two bombs exploded in Buenos Aires early today, but there wereno injuries.   One destroyed the entrance of an office of the Radical CivicUnion Party, which was defeated in May 14 elections. Many have saidthe defeat by the Peronists was because of the economic problems.   The other bomb caused some damage outside a Communist YouthFederation office.   Argentina, rich in resources and once one of the world'swealthiest nations, has been in steady decline for years. Manytrace the crisis back to the policies of former president Gen. JuanDomingo Peron, who nationalized industries and expanded socialprograms and public employment, allowing government to grow too bigafter he was elected president in 1946.   Things took a turn for the worse in February, when the CentralBank stopped selling U.S. dollars to prop up the national currency,the austral. Since then, it has been devalued by 90 percent againstthe dollar.   The country has a $59 billion foreign debt, and inflation hitnearly 388 percent last year. Inflation this month may top 70percent, which amounts to an annual rate of 58,162 percent.Government austerity measures have added to the difficulties facedby Argentina's people.   It was the second uprising of its kind to strike a LatinAmerican nation in four months. In February, at least 276 peopledied in Venezuela when rioting broke out over a governmentausterity plan aimed at easing payments on the foreign debt.   In the western city of Mendoza, where a supermarket wasfirebombed Friday, several others were looted Monday. In Cordoba,where 200 looters were arrested last week, there was a ``hungermarch.'' Cordoba is Argentina's second-largest city, Mendoza itsfourth-largest.   Pugliese blamed the unrest on ``ultra-leftists ... who want tocause anarchy.'' He cited the coordination of assaults, jamming ofpolice radio signals, and pamphlets urging Alfonsin to resign andworkers to strike.   Leftist leaders denounced the state of siege and blamed thedisturbances on the failure of Alfonsin's economic policy.   ``The way to calm people down is to grant an immediate salaryhike of 100 percent, index wages weekly, freeze prices and tellbusinesses and stores _ on pain of confiscation _ to deliverimmediately food and medicine at the frozen prices,'' said deputyLuis Zamora of the Movement Toward Socialism.   The dead in Rosario were identified by police as Jose La Rosa,47, shot in the neck by people firing from a passing car, JuanaAmelia Mazzi, 66, who suffered a heart attack during a melee at asupermarket, and an unidenfied man shot at another supermarket.   Under the state of siege, police may conduct raids withoutobtaining warrants and make arrests without specific charges.   President-elect Carlos Menem, who is due to take office on Dec.10, backed the decree, saying ``this wave of confrontations, ofdisturbances, of lootings must stop.''</TEXT></DOC>
