The paper told the story of pig farmers in Jiangxi province whostuffed four tax collectors into a pig pen after the officialsdemanded payment.   ``Man and pig mixed together as they drove the collectors fromtown to town,'' the story said. ``One of the criminals stood on thecrate and urinated on the officials.'' Police later arrested themand in February they were sentenced to several years in prison.   Tax evasion runs rampant throughout China, especially amongartists, actors and businessmen, who make more than $108 a month,the minimum taxable amount. The average urban Chinese makes about$25 a month; the average rural Chinese makes about $12 a month.   ``Why should I pay taxes?'' said a well-known actress who makesabout $13,500 a year _ 44 times the average. ``All those forms tofill out. I'd rather spend my money on fun things like eating andclothes.''   ``In every corner of China, there's tax evasion,'' according tothe People's Daily. ``Businessmen lie when they fill in forms,famous artists `donate' their paintings for a hefty sum, actorsdon't use their real names and ask for payment in cash.''   But individuals aren't the only ones guilty of malfeasance.State-run companies and collective enterprises also cheat. In recentyears, the percent of tax income in the country's national incomehas fallen from 35 percent to about 26 percent.   Still, most reports concentrate on entrepreneurs, possiblybecause they have less power than larger firms to suppress criticismabout them in the state-run press.   The reports of widespread tax evasion and violent opposition totax collectors are an indication of growing corruption andrestiveness in China.   Economic reforms designed to introduce elements of a marketeconomy in China's state-run system have created vast differentialsof wealth and opportunities for cheating. The reforms have alsotriggered inflation of more than 26 percent, the highest price risessince the 1949 revolution. This in turn has sparked an angryresponse.   Increased tax revenue is supposed to play a critical role infunding the reforms. The government's inability to collectsufficient funds is hurting the program, reports have said.   China began to tax individual incomes in 1980. In 1987, itinstituted a progressive income tax for all citizens and privatebusinesses.   Individuals pay taxes on a sliding scale beginning at 20 percentfor every $108 earned a month and ending at 60 percent for incomesof more than $216.   Large state-run companies pay 55 percent of their profits, whilesmaller companies and collective pay on a sliding scale that topsout at 55 percent. Individual businesses are taxed like individualswith the addition of production and business taxes.   One of the problems is that the state has been slow to punish taxevaders.   ``Every since 1987, we have yet to hear of a tax evader beingsent to court,'' the People's Daily said.   It also said many beatings of tax collectors have gone unpunished.   ``Some of the crimes have been settled by fines, others are beingcalled simply civil disputes,'' it said. ``This has allowed manycriminals to go scot free and hurt efforts to stop anti-taxviolence.''   It said that since 1985, 7,807 cases of beatings and attacks hadbeen reported. In addition to the 13 dead, 27 officials have beencrippled and 786 collectors were seriously injured.   Yu Lei, deputy chief of the Ministry of Public Security, said thesituation had to stop.   ``We will not tolerate a continuation of this situation,'' hesaid, speaking on national television Tuesday night. ``We will begindealing very harshly with these criminals.''</TEXT></DOC>
