Althoughdiagnosis of the optochiasmatic occupying process is simple by scan orNMR imaging, it is generally difficult to identify the chiasma in a processof this type. It is therefore impossible to recognize the two forms ofthese tuberculomas: intra- and peri-chiasmatic histologic types, andyet these have an incidence on therapy and prognosis. Surgical explorationis justified when the diagnosis remains in doubt or when the functionalprognosis is implicated.</TEXT></DOC>
