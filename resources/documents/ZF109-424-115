That's Wang Laboratories Taiwan, but the name &quot;Wang&quot; doesn't appear inthe ads.andP;  Wang's some money from the clone business, while avoiding channelconflict by being coy about the name.andP;  Meanwhile, the mail order customergets a semi-Wang system that the company refuses to put its name on.andO;Bizarre.andM;It makes one appreciate what Hewlett-Packard has done.andP;  They have pursued thePC market and given their VARs a steady stream of elegant, saleablemicrocomputer equipment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
