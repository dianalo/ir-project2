It's a Catch 22 forenvironmentalists that the law intended to protect endangeredmarine mammals also has produced a threat to some endangered fish.</TEXT><TEXT/><BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fishermen, divers and coastal residents on PugetSound are being frustrated by large herds of sea lions and harborseals feasting on bottom fish, salmon and endangered steelheadtrout headed upstream to spawn.   The federal law that protects endangered whales and other marinemammals prohibits killing the sea lions which kill and eat morethan half of the steelhead run each year.   Up to 2,000 sea lions converge on Puget Sound each fall andtheir numbers are on the rise, wildlife experts say.   In addition to their threat to the fisheries, floats designed asdivers' rest spots are typically crowded with barking sea lions,and at least one ferry dock has reeked from their droppings.   California sea lions arrive from their sunny summer climes offCalifornia in October and November and stay in the Northwest intoApril and May before migrating back south.   Sea lions and harbor seals, which reside year-round in the samearea, have flourished under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act,originally designed to save whales, sea otters, and other marinemammals, including some seals and sea lions, whose numbers weredecimated over the past 100 years.   ``People like to watch the bears at Yellowstone Park, but ifthey get into the garbage cans or pose a threat they are taken andremoved, and if they return once or twice, the animals aredestroyed,'' says James Schmidt of Trout Unlimited in Seattle.   ``One learns it from the other. You have to learn to eliminatethe ones that have learned to go to the garbage dump.''   The learning process that brings bears to dumps in parks is thesame learning process that has attracted sea lions to the BallardLocks in Seattle, where salmon and steelhead must use a fish ladderto gain access to fresh waters of Lake Washington and the streamswhere they spawn.   Once one sea lion learns the fish are easy pickings, he bringshis buddies, scientists say.   ``It's just got worse and worse since 1980,'' says Susan Ewing,spokeswoman for the Washington Department of Wildlife. She saidthat while a few sea lions used to show up, up to 26 sea lions areexpected to be on hand at the fish ladder when steelhead startrunning this month.   Last winter, about 800 wild steelhead managed to spawn, with sealions blamed for killing more than that number. The previouswinter, less than 500 fish escaped to spawn.   A group of commercial and sport fishermen had sought changes inthe Marine Mammal Protection Act this year that would have allowedfederal fisheries managers to shoot sea lions that encroached onthe fish.   Jerry Pavletich of the Salmon and Steelhead Council of TroutUnlimited notes that various efforts to chase away the sea lions ornet off the fish ladder approach, have failed.   Unless the sea lions are somehow driven off, he says, theendangered wild steelhead could be goners.   Despite efforts by fishermen, Congress decided against givingmanagers the option of killing the sea lions.   ``I think Congress refused to bite the bullet,'' Pavletich says.``It's understandable. It's a very emotional issue. There is strongsupport to protect marine mammals at any cost. Even at the cost ofour fisheries resources, and that is unfortunate.''   Congress did, however, continue the act five more years, and iscalling for research into fisheries and mammal resources in theNorth Pacific, a move that some fish managers applauded.   A large environmental coalition, led by Greenpeace, also waspleased with the outcome in Congress.   Ben Deeble, Northwest ocean ecology campaigner for Greenpeace,says Congress simply didn't believe the marine mammals should besubject to control by lethal means because of the one problem casein Puget Sound.   Pavletich says the law allows parties to petition for a reviewof marine mammal populations and the head of the U.S. Department ofCommerce could authorize shooting the sea lions in some cases.   Joe Scordino, marine mammal coordinator for the Northwestregional office of the National Marine Fisheries Service, says thesea lion hasn't been endangered since it was hunted in the 1920s.   Guy Thornburgh, executive director of the Pacific MarineFisheries Commission in Portland, Ore., says he would like to see aregional management council for marine mammals, like the fisheriescommission, to develop a policy on marine mammal management.   According to Scordino, an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 sea lionsfeed in Puget Sound each year, from fall to spring. Each year,their numbers and the length of their stay appear to be on therise, Scordino says.   There may be as many as 4,000 more sea lions fattening up eachwinter in British Columbia's Georgia Strait, and as many as 157,000may inhabit West Coast waters altogether.   While direct links between sea lions and hake, or whiting,stocks haven't been established, Cyreis Schmitt, a state fisheriesmarine biologist, said the fishery has plunged from an estimated 45million pounds in 1983 to 14 million pounds this year.   She said the fishery may have to be closed for a couple of yearsif it's to be saved.   Sea lions were estimated to have eaten up to 2 million pounds ofhake this year, while fishermen were allowed to take only 500,000pounds.   Pat Gearin, biologist with the National Marine FisheriesService, says hake, a much slower fish than salmon or steelhead,was found in 68 percent of sea lion scat studied in the sound in1987.   Meanwhile, harbor seal populations in Northwest coastal watershave increased 10 percent a year since 1976. They forage freely inareas where they used to be shot by fishermen, Scordino says.   More than 75 percent of the gill-net salmon fisheries at GraysHarbor and Willapa Bay are being destroyed by harbor seals, hesays, adding, ``I think we're just seeing the tip of the iceberg.''   Fortunately, Scordino says, tackling sea lion nuisance problemsunrelated to fisheries has been a lot easier.   Large timber floats for divers at the Edmonds Underwater Parkwere recently replaced with smaller foam floats that the basking,barking sea lions can't leap onto. A floating platform at the localferry dock has been fenced off, so the stench from the beasts isdissipating.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 13</NOTE></DOC>
