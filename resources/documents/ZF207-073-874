 On the horizon in every direction are enticing islands, withfabled riches desired by the millions of passengers on board -- dBASE usersall.andM;The ship has no rudder and no sail.andP;  Each crew member has a paddle, somebigger than others.andP;  Manning the oars are clever, creative, but strong-willedindividualists, with names like Foxy, Mr. A.T., Old Man Tucket, and Q.andO;Silver.andP;  Each is rowing furiously, trying to force the ship to move in aspecific direction.andP;  Unfortunately, they can't agree on which way to head --each paddles differently.andM;Once in awhile a few rowers manage to synchronize their oars long enough tomaneuver near a particular island.andP;  The passengers cheer, urging them on.andO;But as they approach the beach, someone on the other side of the ship decidesto paddle somewhere else.andP;  As passengers wail, back to sea they go.andP;  Attimes, disagreement among rowers is so high that the ship sits in one spotand twirls.andM;One crew member sports a tattoo of a skull, crossbones, and the crypticsymbol &quot;IV.&quot;andP;  He has a loud voice and a huge paddle, but a poor sense ofpurpose.andP;  More muscle than brain, he can't find an island on his own andwon't cooperate with those who can.andP;  Whenever the ship sets on a course, hepaddles the other direction.andP;  Sometimes he runs from side to side, paddlingthe ship into a spin all by himself.andP;  This puts the other rowers intoconvulsions of laughter; the passengers suffer convulsions.andM;As the sun rises today, the passengers are seasick, the marvelous islands arefrustratingly close, and the ship is clearly going nowhere fast.andP;  Severalhigh powered hydrofoils are glimpsed on the horizon, and a rumor is spreadingthat the constant course changing has buckled the ship's hull.andP;  What shouldthe passengers do?andP;  Sit still and hope they don't go down with the ship?andO;They could wait for the hydrofoils to come close then swing aboard, but whatif these high-powered alternatives turn out to be just a mirage, operated byanother crazy crew, or headed for the edge of the earth?andP;  Some want to jumpship and swim for an island, but the waters are shark-infested, and noteveryone can tread water long enough to make it to solid ground.andP;  A loyal fewcling to the hope that the paddlers will realize they can't keep rowing incircles, especially on a sinking ship.andP;  What should they do?andP;  What would youdo?andM;The Ashton-Tate storyandM;I won't argue the specific case of Ashton-Tate versus Fox Software.andP;  Theseare legal issues that won't be easily resolved.andP;  But Ashton-Tate'spublicly-stated justification for the suit--that they must protect theinterests of their shareholders--is the best reason to sell your stock now.andO;Since 1985, Ashton-Tate has been routinely shooting itself in the foot.andP;  Now,perhaps tired of limping, the gun has been placed squarely between the eyes.andO;The question is, do we want the trigger pulled?andM;Ashton-Tate is trying to regain control of a dBASE world that seems to thrivein spite of them.andP;  Their massive corporate superstructure is balanced on asmall foundation, with pillars named Multimate, Framework, FullWrite and afew others.andP;  Dead center is the massive pillar called dBASE.andP;  Should itshatter, the other supports could buckle and bring the whole thing down.andO;Some industry observers believe Ashton-Tate must maintain their dBASEcustomer base to survive.andP;  How can they best do that?andP;  The obvious answer is:be competitive.andP;  Ashton-Tate, on the other hand, seems to think dominance canbe guaranteed by killing the competition.andP;  History abounds with evidence thateven monopolies don't automatically survive.andP;  Most attempts to buy or bullymarkets fail completely.andP;  Maybe that's why, a few months ago, Ashton-Tatetried the constructive approach.andM;In Sept. 1988, Ashton-Tate gathered over 1,000 dBASE developers for anuplifting &quot;Meeting of the Minds.&quot;andP;  On Ashton-Tate's mind was the urgent needto sell professional dBASE users on trust.andP;  Trust Ashton-Tate to build a goodproduct.andP;  Trust Ashton-Tate to provide power.andP;  Trust Ashton-Tate to deliveron time.andP;  Trust Ashton-Tate to support developers.andP;  Trust Ashton-Tate to mendits ways.andP;  Trust, trust, trust.andP;  Trust is powerful, but fragile.andP;  Truth willtranscend trust every time.andP;  And the truth is:  Ashton-Tate has broken almostevery promise made in September.andM;Down for the countandM;Perhaps exploiting 1,000 people is seen as a minor blunder.andP;  Isn't dBASE IIIPLUS owned by more than a million users?andP;  Users don't know how the developersfeel.andP;  Users will buy the upgrade.andP;  Don't they count the most?andP;  In the shortterm, yes.andP;  Ashton-Tate needs to sell each owner an upgrade.andP;  That'simmediate cash flow.andP;  But beyond the next few months, what counts most ispleasing the rest of the dBASE users, because they are the majority.andP;  Themajority?andM;Let's guesstimate how many dBASE users there are.andP;  Start with the million ortwo who bought Ashton-Tate products.andP;  Add the tens of thousands more whobought FoxBASE+, Clipper, Quicksilver/dBXL and other compatible products.andO;That's a big number, but it's just the tip of the iceberg.andP;  Aren't we missingthe most important group of all?andM;To get the real count of dBASE users, we must ask how many people benefitfrom each copy of a dBASE-type product sold.andP;  What multiplier should we use?andO;Count the copies placed on every computer in an office, whether purchased ornot.andP;  Count everyone on a network sharing a single multiuser copy.andP;  Count thenumber of people using applications running under FoxBASE Runtime, compiledwith Clipper, and compiled with Quicksilver.andP;  This number could run into thehundreds per developer, and we're counting all developers, from SBT tocorporate programmers to you and me, worldwide.andM;The number of dBASE users does not equal the number of boxes shipped byAshton-Tate.andP;  The real importance of dBASE is the number of users around theworld who, day in and day out, perform vital business functions withapplications written in the dBASE language.andP;  Because of its flexibility,capacity, and, yes, even ease of use, the dBASE language is the foundationfor more business applications than we may ever know.andP;  Few of theseapplications require the ownership of Ashton-Tate's brand of dBASE.andP;  Whatevertheir role once was, today's dBASE orbits well above Ashton-Tate's reach.andO;dBASE is now in the hands of consultants, developers, programmers and users.andO;Unfortunately, their collective grip is far from firm.andM;Why dBASE?andM;Many companies misunderstand the appeal of dBASE.andP;  Let's say Microsoft has adatabase manager that uses DBF files.andP;  Will that induce dBASE programmers toswitch?andP;  No.andP;  If an alternative database development environment does notallow dBASE programmers to benefit from their most valuable asset, it willhave no appeal at all.andP;  No one &quot;programs&quot; DBFs.andP;  In fact, one of the mostcriticized aspects of dBASE has been its crude file/index architecture.andM;The never-ending need for custom business applications fuels the developer'srocket.andP;  The dBASE language seems amazingly capable of handling anychallenge.andP;  Many database products claim to be superior to dBASE, but mostfail to give developers everything they need.andP;  Besides, all alternativeproducts suffer from the same fatal flaw.andP;  They're different.andP;  To switch tosomething different means trading your five-star general developer rank forbuck private status.andP;  If we could stop the world for three months, dBASEdevelopers might all buy something better, master it, and emerge strongerthan ever.andP;  Since we can't, the business and developer worlds aren't likelyto abandon dBASE unless dBASE abandons them.andM;The single, most valuable possession of dBASE programmers is their skill withthe language.andP;  The language is the essence of dBASE.andP;  That's why Oracle,SyBase and others want to use dBXL and Quicksilver as a front end to theirdifferent database systems.andP;  As long as a development language is a tastyflavor of dBASE, the file structure matters very little (assuming reliabletwo-way conversion is provided).andP;  Programmers will be productive and clientswill be served.andM;You always hurt the onesandM;you loveandM;Ashton-Tate knows why developers love dBASE, so they're emphasizing theirclaim of ownership of the language.andP;  Presumably they imagine that if theyexclusively own the language, they will exclusively control the hugeapplications development world.andP;  Legal experts disagree on the odds ofAshton-Tate prevailing in its claims, but computer experts agree on theoutcome.andP;  Having tasted quality, users will not allow developers to return tomediocrity.andP;  If the only dBASE product we have to use is the current ornear-future dBASE IV, we'll all be forced to abandon ship.andP;  Self-preservationrequires it.andM;If Ashton-Tate torpedoes all true dBASE language products, users will turn totheir in-house or independent computer professionals for guidance.andP;  Shouldthey switch to dBASE IV, R:BASE, Paradox, or some fantastic product comingout real soon now?andP;  When catastrophe strikes, people instinctively act toprotect themselves from further harm.andP;  They aren't likely to adopt dBASE IVand get back on board the good ship Lunatic.andP;  Instead, they'll seek a powerdatabase that is beyond the range of Ashton-Tate's heavy artillery but withinthe reach of dBASE refugees.andP;  Certainly, some people will wander off tocompletely different environments.andP;  But I think the most desirable haven forpeople fleeing the dBASE shipwreck will be the product that offers completedevelopment tools in the most dBASE-like way.andP;  Such a product will be theleast expensive, least disruptive, fastest path back to full developer/userproductivity.andM;Heir to the throneandM;No one knows where dBASE's successor will come from.andP;  We have ample evidencethat building tight development products can't be done by the committees andhuge teams employed by large companies.andP;  The ultimate winner may be a productfrom a firm as yet unknown to us.andP;  Ironically, one such alternative isalready in the race, and from the originator of dBASE.andM;The dark horse entry is Wayne Ratliff's Emerald Bay database engine and Eaglelanguage.andP;  This is probably the product dBASE IV should have been.andP;  Eagle hasa syntax, style, and feel so familiar that a dBASE developer can beproductive within hours.andP;  Emerald Bay's database engine works on a 640K XT,while other products demand huge memory and very fast machines.andP;  Networkedapplications using the Emerald Bay central server can even run without usingan expensive network operating system!andP;  As additional &quot;surfaces&quot; appear, therichness of an Emerald Bay developer's toolkit will become enviable.andO;Unfortunately, Migent was the initial marketing agent, and their financialproblems have been severe.andP;  But Wayne Ratliff owns Emerald Bay, and he vowsthat it will survive and prosper.andP;  Ratliff wants the Eagle language to be thenext evolutionary step beyond dBASE, and he wants Emerald Bay to be thedatabase engine supported by surfaces ranging from Eagle to Lotus 1-2-3,including SQL, word processors, graphics, UNIX, Macintosh, and OS/2.andP;  Whileothers make fantasy promises, Wayne Ratliff has a real product now.andO;Ironically, the person who started it may turn out to be the person who leadsthe way to dBASE's future--or end.andM;Mob sceneandM;What about the other dBASE contenders?andP;  What does the future hold for thosewho mimic today's dBASE?andP;  Who are the players, and what are they trying todo?andM;According to Nantucket, Clipper will evolve separately from dBASE.andP;  As longas it continues to offer features that power programmers need, Clipper has abright future.andP;  However, as the competition catches up, new product saleswill be harder to come by.andP;  FoxBASE+ will have EXE output soon, theAshton-Tate Professional Compiler has Clipper in its sights, and severalnewcomers are making enticing promises.andP;  Nantucket's McMax has beenoutclassed by FoxBASE+/Mac.andP;  Further, Nantucket might not survive a prolongedlegal battle with Ashton-Tate.andP;  As a possible defense, a dBASE languageproduct might try to sidestep legal attack by changing their language to bedifferent from dBASE.andP;  Clipper users might be the most accepting of such achange, since Clipper has never been the most dBASE-compatible language.andM;Although both Clipper and McMAx will be improved, and are quite nice in theirown right, momentum often means more than technology.andP;  FoxBASE+ is on a roll,reminiscent of WordPerfect just before it went screaming past thecompetition.andP;  Fox Software has by far the most balanced position in the dBASEworld.andP;  FoxBASE+ is a solid performer, FoxBASE+/LAN is the easiest way to rundBASE applications on a network, FoxBASE+/Mac is superb, the UNIX version istolerable, and the new connectivity between the DOS and Mac versions fills amajor market need.andP;  Clipper users grouse, rightfully, about Fox's uninspiredlanguage extensions and poor UDF design.andP;  Network speed freaks wishFoxBASE+/LAN didn't slow down so much.andP;  The UNIX edition, like most UNIXsoftware, is perpetually stuck at last year's version.andP;  The runtime licensingrequirement makes Fox more expensive than Clipper, and Fox applications aremore clumsy to distribute.andP;  Support is variable and the manuals are weak.andO;These are all legitimate complaints, meaning Fox Software could be better,but they are doing most things right most of the time.andP;  Ashton-Tate mayinjure or even kill Fox, but it's difficult to see how this will help fixdBASE IV.andP;  A more likely outcome will give people a reason to abandon dBASEcompletely.andM;WordTech Systems, Inc., maker of dBXL and Quicksilver, seems to have hitchedits wagon to those who want to offer dBASE language front ends to foreign,SQL-oriented database servers.andP;  Why WordTech?andP;  Apparently because they'veclaimed immunity from legal action based upon the agreement that transferredWordTech's early SQL technology to Ashton-Tate.andP;  Ashton-Tate now claimsWordTech does not have such freedom.andP;  Does Oracle want to be in the dBASEworld enough to take on Ashton-Tate?andP;  Can WordTech survive if their strategicpartnerships disintegrate?andP;  If WordTech's strategy pans out, skill with thedBASE language will open even more doors.andM;Bumblebee Software's dBFast is targeting the low-priced market that dBXL hasmoved beyond.andP;  So is Button-ware's PC-File/DB, and other products that may ormay not be real.andP;  None of these companies would be likely to stay in themarket if Ashton-Tate unleashed their lawyers on them.andP;  When you are too newto have market share, and your product's appeal is mostly price, the cost ofdefense is likely to exceed the benefits of winning.andM;The best way to make money is to sell something that has no cost.andP;  Thisobvious principal is the reason dBASE developers should be watching McMax,FoxBASE+/Mac, dBMAN, SCO FoxBASE+, Recital and Emerald Bay very closely.andP;  Ifyou've already developed an application that runs under DOS, and you make itwork on other hardware platforms with minimum tweaking, you'll end up with anextremely high profit margin.andP;  Conversely, users will have access to provensoftware at lower prices.andP;  No other powerful database programminglanguage--not R:BASE, Paradox, or any other--exists in as many forms asdBASE.andP;  (I'm eliminating BASIC and COBOL; if you prefer them, you obviuslyhaven't learned dBASE.)andM;Recital opens up the DEC VAX minicomputer market to dBASE developers.andP;  Thisis an opportunity to relish, but it is a whole new ball game for most DOSprogrammers.andP;  It does require a working knowledge of the VAX environment.andO;Only a few will be qualified and well-financed enough to pursue it.andO;Ashton-Tate has announced an alliance with DEC to develop a dBASE-for-VAXproduct, but Recital is here now in a far more impressive form thanAshton-Tate is likely to produce.andM;SCO FoxBASE+ is the dBASE language door into the UNIX market, where COBOL hasbeen dominant.andP;  Since dBASE programmers are usually more productive thanCOBOL programmers, SCO FoxBASE+ creates a competitive advantage.andO;Unfortunately, the UNIX version trails far behind the DOS and Mac versions ofFoxBASE+ in features (this is typical of DOS to UNIX ports).andP;  SCO will sharewhatever fate befalls Fox Software as a result of the Ashton-Tate lawsuit.andM;The Macintosh world is now open to dBASE programmers who use FoxBASE+/Mac,Nantucket's McMax, or the new dBMAN Mac.andP;  A version of dBMAN also runs on theAtari.andP;  Users of these computers don't necessarily crave dBASE, but theydesperately need good business applications.andM;The dBASE developer now has opportunities to apply existing programmingskills to a wide range of operating systems and platforms.andP;  But are theseopportunities theoretical or practical? Is it really possible to developapplications under DOS, port them to foreign platforms, and expect them torun?andP;  In general, no.andP;  If you intend to program for a specific environment,you'll need extensive access to that environment.andP;  The additional financialand learning investment required to program for UNIX, VAX, or Mac systemsmight be more than many MS-DOS developers will choose to incur.andP;  But forthose who have economical access, the opportunities are substantial.andP;  Mostimportantly, these alternative platform products can give the dBASE languagethe critical mass needed to become the universal mini and microcomputersuccessor to COBOL and BASIC.andM;This is another area where Ashton-Tate's lawsuit could close the door just asit opens.andP;  Ashton-Tate may claim ownership of all dBASE markets, but theyhave absolutely nothing to contribute.andP;  If Ashton-Tate drives away firms whohave developed solutions, it won't be a delaying action; it will be the endof dBASE on alternative platforms.andP;  You don't get two chances.andM;This little piggy goes toandM;marketandM;Add-on tools are as important to programming as they are to cooking.andP;  Havinga drawer full of gadgets makes any task easier.andP;  No product has as manyadd-ons as dBASE.andP;  (Lotus 1-2-3 comes close, but templates aren't the same asadd-ons that increase and extend the power of the programming language.)andO;dBASE add-ons add functions from graphics to spreadsheets.andP;  They giveprogrammers enough tools to structure, document, generate, analyze, trace,debug and manage any development project imaginable.andM;The existence of the huge dBASE after-market is often used as evidence of theshortcomings of dBASE.andP;  A truly powerful database system wouldn't need all ofthat, or so the argument goes.andP;  Asknowledging an element of truth, the realinterpretation is different.andP;  If the marketplace offers 20 documentingutilities, it may prove that dBASE needs one, but it also guaranteeswonderful choices at affordable prices.andP;  Only a large, vibrant primary marketcan support a large after-market.andP;  Products that don't benefit from extensiveadd-ons often suffer from lack of critical mass rather than lack of criticalneed.andM;Treasure huntandM;Where is the dBASE language going?andP;  If it is to survive, it must go wheredevelopers want to go.andP;  So, what do dBASE developers want? More capabilities,more flexibility, more performance, more control, more platforms, moreprogrammer productivity, and more solid support--without losing thefundamentals that make it dBASE.andP;  That's why R:BASE, Paradox, Clarion,Revelation, and others haven't made any serious dents in dBASE (they'vedeveloped markets of their own, but not to the detriment of dBASE).andP;  Thetrauma of switching from the dBASE language to any other, however good, is aprice few dBASE developers are willing to pay.andP;  If dBASE fails them, they aremost likely to switch to the most dBASE-like alternative.andP;  Developers whowant more power now are already making the switch.andM;Some people claim dBASE is a dinosaur whose death is long overdue.andO;Scientists tell us that many dinosaurs died due to a cataclysmic event (likean Ashton-Tate lawsuit?).andP;  But the more adaptive dinosaurs, already ahead oftheir time, did not become extinct.andP;  Instead, they evolved into today'smaster of the sky, the bird.andP;  The most resourceful dinosaurs of yesteryearsoar above us to this day.andP;  I'm keeping my eyes on the Eagle.andM;John L. Hawkins is president of HawkTek Corp., management/technologyconsultants, P.O. Box 6476, San Rafael, Calif.andP;  94903, phone (415) 491-HAWK.andO;Mr. Hawkins is also a dBASE developer, college computer/accounting teacher,president of the Marin-Sonoma PC Users Group, and author of the monthly&quot;Hawk's RAM&quot; report.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
