The respected Middle East Economic Survey said the committee ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is ``expected togo through the formal motions of reviewing the market situation.''   But it said ``the main topic on the agenda will be the U.A.E.'sunilateral decision to allocate itself an `official' quota of 1.5million barrels a day'' and the impact of this on OPEC's productionquota and the market.   There has been no official announcement of the meeting of thecommittee, comprisng oil ministers of Nigeria, Algeria, Indonesia,Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.   A final decision on the meeting may depend on the visit of OPECSecretary-General Subroto, of Indonesia, to the U.A.E., thenewsletter said. He is expected there later this week afterfinishing the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.   The Middle East Economic Survey said Dr. Subroto faces adifficult task because the U.A.E.'s Supreme Petroleum Councildecided July 18 to increase production to 1.5 million barrels aday. The U.A.E.'s OPEC-set production quota is 948,000 barrels aday.   Crude oil prices have fallen below the OPEC benchmark price of$18 a barrel, even without the increase in production by theU.A.E., largely because of increased non-OPEC production andabove-quota production by OPEC members.   To enforce the $18 price, OPEC alloted each of its members aquota with total OPEC production set at 15 million barrels a day.   This excludes Iraq which refused its allotted quota of 1.54million barrels a day and has insisted on a quota equal to that ofIran, its Persian Gulf war opponent, or 2.37 million barrels a day.Meanwhile, Iraq has been producing at a level of about 2.7 millionbarrels a day.</TEXT></DOC>
