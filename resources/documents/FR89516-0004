The rule provided that as of August 19, 1988, the Bureauof Export Administration would begin accepting the Australian Import Certificateas supporting documentation for the export license application (Form BXA-622P).It also provided a grace period until October 3, 1988 within which eitherthe Australian Import Certificate or the Statement by Ultimate Consigneeand Purchaser (Form ITA-629P) would be accepted by the Bureau of ExportAdministration and that after October 3, 1988 only the Import Certificatewould be acceptable. That rule was amended by a notice of August 1, 1988(53 FR 28864) that extended the grace period indefinitely in order to allowboth governments more time to integrate their procedures for implementingnew documentation requirements. This rule amends the previous rule by establishingthe date of June 15, 1989, whereby only the Australian Import Certificatewill be accepted to support an export license application for ``A'' levelcommodities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective June 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Patricia Muldonian, Office ofTechnology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone:(202) 377-2440.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements </ITAG>1. This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. The Import Certificate and Delivery Verification (IC/DV) requirementset forth in Part 775 supersedes the requirement for Form ITA-629P, Statementby Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser (approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0694-0021) to accompany license applications(approved under OMB control number 0694-0005) for exports and reexportsto Australia. The Import Certificate and Delivery Verification are issuedby the Government of Australia and do not constitute collection of informationrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>). 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire this rule be published in proposed form because this rule doesnot impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule. Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is noformal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome ona continuing basis.
