Suburban malls and downtown shopping districts in many citiesand towns were jammed with shoppers eager for hard-to-find Nintendovideo games, electronic gear, costume jewelry, accessories,perfumes and novelty gifts.   Many merchants expanded their hours, anticipating a crush ofbusiness on a day that traditionally is their busiest of the year.   Despite earlier openings, managers in many areas arrived to findcustomers lined up waiting for stores to open, a hopeful sign inwhat has been a so-so year for retailers.   ``It's wall-to-wall people,'' said Dianne Haynes, customerservice representative at the Oxmoor Center in Louisville, Ky.``They're definitely shopping and buying; everybody's got packages.We can't move in here.''   Evon Wright, 35, waited in a crowd for stores to open at ValleyFair Shopping Center in San Jose, Calif. ``My husband is stayinghome with the kids today,'' she said. ``It's freedom at any price.All the women worked hard yesterday and now it's a day for us.''   In nearby Santa Cruz, residents flocked to the opening of a tentpavilion at the site of a downtown mall devastated by the Oct. 17earthquake. ``We just felt we must support Santa Cruz and see itcome out of the rubble and live again,'' shopper Louise Bagnallsaid.   Bob Gilley, manager of the Sears, Roebuck and Co. store at MerleHay Mall in Des Moines, Iowa, said: ``Nintendo is selling awfulgood and camcorders are blowing out. Anything in the electric(department) is selling very well.''   The Santa Claus at Raleigh, N.C.'s Crabtree Valley Mall saidmost of the several dozen children who had confided their requeststo him Friday morning asked for Nintendo items.   A few crowd-stoppers fell into the gag gift category. Pots ofRock 'n Flowers _ colorful, plastic flowers that ``dance'' to music_ entertained customers at the entrances to a number of stores.   Rita Eisenberg, spokeswoman for John Wanamaker's departmentstore in downtown Philadelphia, said Yuppy Puppy products appearedpopular. For $2 to $65, the pet products include Haute Caninegourmet popcorn and bagels, chewable sneakers and french fries,faux pet pearls and gold chains.   Heavy markdowns at some troubled stores triggered waves ofbargain hunters. The six B. Altman andamp; Co. department stores in NewYork, New Jersey and Pennsylvania drew hordes of people toliquidation sales. Altman is virtually going out of business _leaving only its Cincinnati store open _ because its financiallyailing parent Hooker Corp. couldn't find a buyer for the chain.   The morning crowd clamoring to get into B. Altman's main storein Manhattan was so heavy that shoppers were admitted in shifts. Bymid-afternoon police surrounding the exterior of the enormous storewere turning people away, saying the building was dangerouslyovercrowded.   Special prices and services for shoppers who showed up earlyboosted traffic at many places.   The Wal-Mart discount store in Terre Haute, Ind., offered extralow prices on selected items from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., AssistantManager Kris Gates said. During a 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. sale at FredMeyer's, a discount store about 20 miles south of downtown Seattle,shoppers drank free coffee, sipped apple cider and munched ondoughnuts.   Shoppers at Grossmont Center outside San Diego could leave theiryoungsters at a free child care center and take beepers in case ofan emergency. Emporium-Capwell's outside Oakland lured Bay Areabuyers with free valet parking for three hours.   The early starting times weren't a resounding successeverywhere. In West Virginia, only a few shoppers had turned upwhen Charleston Town Center's anchor stores opened at 8 a.m., twohours earlier than usual.   ``It hasn't exactly been a door-busting event,'' said BonnieGodfrey, senior merchandising manager for the J.C. Penney Co. Inc.store there.   The wintry weather that blasted the Northeast may have been ablessing for retailers that had been having poor sales ofcold-weather goods.   New York's first Thanksgiving snowfall in 51 years, combinedwith freezing temperatures, apparently put people in the mood tobuy warm clothing, said Ann Stock, spokeswoman at theBloomingdale's in Manhattan.   Almost half of retailers' annual business is done in the weeksbetween Thanksgiving and Christmas.   Most retailers and industry analysts are expecting cautiousspending this year on expensive, long-lasting goods, such as homeappliances. Overall retail sales are predicted to rise only 5.5percent over last year, compared with 1988's surprisingly strong 9percent gain.   Typically there is a crush of shopping done in the daysimmediately after Thanksgiving and then a long lull until thefinal, frantic days just before Christmas.   For the most part, shoppers seemed happy to jostle their waythrough the crowds if it meant finding good deals.   Shopping at an Atlanta mall, Mattie Wyatt said she didn't mindlooking for presents amid the post-Thanksgiving throng. ``It'sconvenient, there's enough parking, and there are sales,'' Mrs.Wyatt said. ``What could be better?''   But there were indications shoppers would be choosy this year.``I'll probably wait until after Christmas to see if I can getanything cheaper,'' said Alice Guerra, in Austin, Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
