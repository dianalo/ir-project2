The GAO questioned the quality of weapons produced for the armed services dating back to 1983, when the office was installed at the Pentagon. At that time, the office was a subject of controversy between the Defense Department and Congress.    The GAO studied six systems tested by the office: the Aegis missile cruiser; the Tomahawk and Maverick missiles; the AHIP helicopter; the Lantirn targeting system; and the Aquila drone, which the Army chose to discontinue.    &quot;In all six cases, we found significant problems or limitations in the degree to which equipment was realistically stressed and, in five of six cases, in the degree to which personnel were realistically stressed,&quot; the GAO said.    At a news conference, members of the Congressional Military Reform Caucus, a bipartisan group of 135 representatives, said the office had failed to comply with its charter. They called for the resignation of the office's director, John Krings. &quot;He doesn't seem to want to do the kind of testing Congress intended when we created this office,&quot; said Rep. Charles Bennett (D., Fla).    Karl Pflock, a spokesman for the office, said Mr. Krings isn't considering resigning. &quot;Any time we do anything anyone disagrees with, they want to make us less independent.&quot; He declined to comment directly on the report, saying the office hadn't reviewed it, but noted that the office's abilities are limited by funding, safety precautions and security.    The Defense Department said that &quot;Mr. Krings is successfully carrying out the responsibilities of his office&quot; and that the attack on him was &quot;inappropriate and unjustified.&quot; It also said the caucus asked the GAO not to seek Pentagon comment.    The Aegis system was used by the crew of the U.S.S. Vincennes, which mistook an Iranian civilian airliner for a fighter plane and shot it down over the Persian Gulf earlier this month. Members of Congress at the news conference said the system wasn't designed to make such distinctions. The GAO's criticism is that the system was never tested with actual missile firings against aerial targets.    In the case of the Maverick missile, the crews were highly trained before testing and weren't representative of combat crews, the report said. Nor were the crews subjected to simulated attacks like those they would encounter in combat, according to the GAO. Crews testing the Tomahawk missile were shown missile routes in advance to limit navigational and test flight errors, the GAO said.    The GAO concluded that no new legislation or reorganization is needed. The problem, it said, is to get the office to carry out existing regulations. </TEXT></DOC>
