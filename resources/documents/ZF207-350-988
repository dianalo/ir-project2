hebelieves it will become the standard for portable computers; the box will beVGA-compatible with a 640 by 480 screen showing at least 16 shades of grey,perhaps as many as 32 shades, using a new graphics controller from CirrusLogic Inc; he hopes to get eight hours on one battery charge and plans to useNickel Hydride rather than Nickel Cadmium cells, because they have double thepower-to-weight ratio, and instead of a floppy, he is thinking in terms ofthe embryonic 20Mb or 40Mb 2.5&quot; Winchesters, and to load stuff into themachine, he is thinking of unconventional means such as infra-redtransmission and radio-frequency modems; he hopes to show the $4,000 box atComdex/Fall.andM;- o -andM;Following the purchase of a 35% stake in General Automation Inc byandM;Sheffield, UK-based Sanderson Electronics Plc for about $2m, the Anaheim,California Pick-popper is able to start repaying some of its debts, and haswritten a cheque to the Inland Revenue Service for $146,000 in accordancewith the agreement to resolve its recorded tax liability of about $4.2m whichdates right back to an audit of the company's fiscal year in 1974; theremaining warrants with Sanderson entitle it to increase its stake to 51% andare exercisable at the Sheffield Pick-popper's discretion.andM;- o -andM;Strand Software Technologies, a division of Watford,andM;Hertfordshire-based AI Ltd has officially launched its commercial programminglanguage designed for parallel processing called Strand88 which was previewedat the UK Computer Measurement Group Conference (CI No 1,191): the languagehas a foreign language interface enabling existing systems to be embedded ina Strand harness to bring out the latent parallelism in their design, andpreserving large amounts of existing code; Strand88 is currently available onSun Microsystems and Intel iPSC/2 kit, and 60-day test drives cost #150,deductable from any ensuing software licence.andM;- o -andM;Teradyne Inc's Electronic Design Automation Group in Santa Clara,andM;California claims its new MultiSim is the first simulation environment toenable integration of electronic design automation tools from multiplevendors, as well as supporting integration of Teradyne's Aida, Lasar andVanquard tools: basic components of MultiSim include user interfaces,framework tools, simulation bus, and simulation tools from Teradyne and othervendors; prices for the user interface and simulation bus start at $10,000;beta shipments begin fourth quarter, production in first quarter 1990.andM;- o -andM;US West Inc directory enquiry operators routinely gave outandM;subscribers' addresses as well as telephone numbers where requested (CI No1,189) until January 1, when it ended the practice because it was worriedthat the service put it outside the rules governing its business - but whenit stopped, it was greeted by howls of protest from organisationsrepresenting the disabled complaining that those who are blind or severelyphysically disabled were being denied access to necessary information, and soit went back and asked the Justice Department for a waiver, which was grantedon May 26 because Justice recommended the move and no-one lodged anyobjections.andM;- o -andM;North Atlantic Industries Inc of Hauppauge, New York has a letterandM;of intent for Asset Management Associates, New York to buy the company for$7.25 per share: North Atlantic supplies peripherals to both military andcommercial computer users, and instrument products to the aerospace industry,partcularly Tempested matrix and laser printers, and the AN-USH-26 NavyStandard Tape Storage Systems and AN-UGC-143A Navy Standard Teleprinter.andM;- o -andM;Crosstalk Communications Inc, Roswell, Georgia confirmed toandM;Newsbytes that the next version of its Crosstalk Mark IV communicationsprogram for MS-DOS machines will include elements of its older Crosstalk XVIprogram: the new Version 2.0 of Crosstalk Mark IV, due to ship later thisyear, will give users a choice of four ways of working with the program -from command lines, from a Crosstalk XVI help screen, via the menu-orientedMark IV interface, or via an interface that looks like a phone book.andM;- o -andM;Even better than the British Gas order on today's front page,andM;Nixdorf Computer AG also announced yesterday that it had landed a $75mcontract from the Ko-operativa Frbundet AB Swedish retail chain forpoint-of-sale check-out systems.andM;- o -andM;DEC was reportedly showing off a working version of its longandM;talked-of Posix-compliant version of the VMS operating systems at a recentDEC User Society meeting in the US, but a generally available version is notexpected for some time, although some conformance should find its way intoVMS version 5.3, due out in the first quarter of 1990.andM;- o -andM;Hitachi Ltd and Toshiba Corp both said they planned to increaseandM;procurement of semiconductors from the US in the current year to March -Hitachi will increase its purchases by 14% over the $98m it bought last year;no word on Toshiba's plans.andM;- o -andM;'S not going to generate too much excitement among ComputergramandM;readers because it covers only those boring but essential resistors andcapacicitors and suchlike - the brightly-coloured parts that dot circuitboards in between the exciting integrated circuits - but Siemens AG andMatsushita Electric Industrial Co are expected to announce a joint venture onpassive components this week, with the Japanese company perhaps taking overSiemens' German production plants.andM;- o -andM;Star Computer Group Plc has bought the outstanding 49% of itsandM;partial Summit Computer Maintenance and Summit Computer Businessesacquisitions, paying the two individual vendors a total of #135,816 cash.andM;- o -andM;Sun Microsystems Inc, as expected, launched a new GXi graphicsandM;accelerator card for the Sun-386i workstation, claiming that graphicsperformance is boosted by from three to 10 times: using the 5 MIPS TMS34010graphics processor from Texas Instruments Inc, with software drivers writtenby Sun itself, it will cost $2,750 (#2,250 in the UK) for existing Sun 386iusers.andM;- o -andM;The issue of Minitels for Prestel has surfaced yet again, andandM;British Telecommunications Plc yesterday repeated that it is considering thecheap French public database terminals, but has now come out firmly againstthe idea of giving the things away free to subscribers as France Telecomdoes, saying they are much too expensive for that.andM;- o -andM;Fujitsu Ltd has signed a licence agreement with StructuralandM;Dynamics Research Corp under which the Japanese company will market SDRC'sI-DEAS Integrated Design Engineering Analysis Software for its S-series ofengineering workstations: it looks to sell 500 copies at $38,500 a time overthe next three years.andM;- o -andM;Oki Electric Indsutry Co's Oki America Inc unit is establishandM;research centres in New York and in California: the centre in New York willconcentrate mainly on development of communications equipment and theCalifornia one will research and develop computer systems.andM;- o -andM;National Semiconductor Corp and Seeq Technology Inc have scaledandM;back their 1987 agreement on development of Flash memory technology to coveronly the current Flash technology, and Seeq will continue the development ofthe next generation 0.8 micron Flash chips alone.andM;- o -andM;The man who broke up Singer Co - he is still chairman of what'sandM;left of it - looks like being broken up himself: Paul Bilzerian has beenconvicted on nine counts of securities fraud and tax violation, none relatingto the Singer takeover, and the charges carry maximum sentences of $2.2m and45 years inside.andM;- o -andM;The General Electric Canadian Holdings Ltd arm of General ElectricandM;Co, Stamford, Connecticut, has now increased its offer price for all theshares of General Electric Canada Inc it doesn't already own to $Can29.50from $27.50 per share, and extended the offer to June 22: it originally bid$Can25 a share.andM;- o -andM;The dreaded Nintendo Co, which once made playing cards but now isandM;credited with bringing the moribund video games market back to lifesingle-handed with its Famicons or Family Computers, is coming to Europe -not under its own name, but via a distribution agreement with Serif CowellsPlc, the company that drove you mad with Trivial Pursuit; Nintendo gamesplayers have been available from high street retailers since 1987, but Serifis planning to put its marketing muscle behind an array of games cartridges.andM;- o -andM;The US Federal Communications Commission has stamped on an ATandamp;T CoandM;plan to give new customers that sign up for its Megacom, Megacom 800 andSoftware-Defined Network Services free multiplexers and related equipment asan inducement, saying that in tying unregulated equipment to regulatedservices, the plan was &quot;patently illegal&quot;: ATandamp;T says some of its rivals aremaking similar offers and it hopes the FCC will apply the rules impartially;MCI Communications Corp says it had responded to ATandamp;T by bundling equipment,but was happy to be able to terminate the offer.andM;- o -andM;Linotype AG, which is now a free-standing German laser printingandM;company whose shares are quoted in Frankfurt, reports that its sales andprofits were both growing at double-digit rates during the first five monthsof 1989: Linotype net profit grew 27% to $23m in 1988.andM;- o -andM;The US Department of Veterans Affairs has awarded a contract for aandM;new data network to Science Applications International Corp and US SprintCommunications Co: the contract is worth $84m over 10 years.andM;- o -andM;As you mourn the depreciation of the currency and the fact thatandM;the pound in your pocket ain't what it was in jovial Jim Callaghan's day, letalone Harold Wilson's, be grateful that you still have a currency: a would-besubscriber in Iasi, Romania who was offered a four-week trial of ourInternational Businessgram publication writes sadly &quot;having no financialsupport in currency, we should very much appreciate receiving yourperiodical, as a gift, not only in the next four weeks -
