Here the ceramic SiSiC would seemto present an alternative to high-alloy metals. The objective of theproject is to discover applications for SiSiC and to employ the materialas a heat exchanger element in the realistic conditions presented bythe environment of a fluidized-bed furnace in order to ascertain itsresistance to corrosion and erosion. Components of differing geometrye.g. straight tubes, hairpin tubes and U-tubes, were developed, manufacturedand tested. Straight tubes were tested, both cooled and uncooled, ina fluidized bed under varying fluidization conditions for a period of200 h. The conclusion was that is was reasonable to consider the manufactureof heat exchanger elements as being feasible very shortly, provided thatthey were not too complex. Larger components, e.g. with diameters andgt; 42mm, are at present being developed. What is still lacking is a suitablemeans of bonding and jointing the ceramic/ceramic transitions. The straighttubes employed in the fluidized-bed furnace remained mechanically stableand suffered no erosive or corrosive damage to speak of during the testperiod.
