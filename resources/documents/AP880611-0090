(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sparks flew Saturday amongDemocratic platform writers over whether to raise taxes on wealthyAmericans, the issue creating the largest gulf between the camps ofcinch presidential nominee Michael Dukakis and runner-up JesseJackson.   The plaform drafters put off until Sunday discussion of defenseand foreign policy issues, while their staffs worked behind thescenes to draft planks on drugs, civil rights, the economy andother domestic issues.   Janice Thurmond, an Athens, Ga., lawyer and Jackson delegate,urged the platform committee to lend Dukakis ``a hand'' by givinghim a credible platform, including a pledge to raise taxes on thoseearning $100,000-plus a year.   ``I am not trying to hamstring our party's nominee. ... We needto give him an answer that is believable when he is accused ofbeing a tax-and-spend Democrat,'' Thurmond told her 15 colleagueson the drafting panel.   ``It would be irresponsible of us not to give him an answer thathe can look any Republican straight in the eye and say, `I am not atax-and-spend Democrat; I am a raise-revenue-and-invest-in-AmericaDemocrat,' and be proud of that,'' said Thurmond, whose father wasJackson's football coach in high school.   But Lena Guerrero, a Texas state representative and Dukakisbacker from Austin, said the talk of raising taxes troubled her.``I think what we have to do is re-order our priorities,'' shesaid. ``Surely there is a better solution than `Give me more.'''   Other Dukakis delegates said the party should look first tocrack down on tax evaders, as the Massachusetts governor haspromised.   Rep. Robert Matsui of California said, ``I find no need to evenraise it in the platform because that would give Bush theopportunity to say, `Oh, look! They're interested in at least somekind of new taxes.''   Michael Barnes, Dukakis's top emissary to the platformcommittee, made a conciliatory statement, saying, ``If it wererequired to have revenue increases down the road, clearly Democratsare going to see that as a last resort.'' Any new revenues would be``based upon policies that recognize who has the ability to pay,''he added.   But Barnes told reporters afterwards, ``The Democratic platformin 1988 is not going to call for a tax increase.''   ``There's no question we're going to prevail,'' said Barnes, aformer Maryland congressman. ``Bruce Babbitt is a great guy, but hedidn't win the nomination.'' Babbitt, like Jackson, promised toraise taxes.   The drafting committee will hold its third and final day ofmeetings Sunday at this resort's Grand Hotel.   The full 186-member platform committee meets in Denver June25-26.   Rep. William Gray III of Philadelphia, who chairs the draftingpanel, said, ``If we can reach a strong consensus and agreement inthe drafting committee, then I think the chances of a large numberof significant amendments in Denver that potentiallay could bedivisive and ripping of the fabric of our party will be lessened.The same thing will be true in Atlanta,'' said Gray.   Gray, a Baptist minister, left at mid-day to officiate at thewedding of a friend's daughter in Atlanta, but planned to returnafterwards.   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's chief emissary, said the taxdispute was ``perhaps the most difficult issue and perhaps thegreatest difference between the Dukakis and the Jackson campaigns.I cannot say for sure whether we will be able to work outcompromise language.''   ``This is a driving force in the Jackson campaign. Otherwise wethink the Democrats risk being ridiculed for wanting to changepriorities but having no vision of how you get the money to doit,'' she said.   She said Barnes' comments on revenues just restated what Dukakishas said all along. ``One wonders if we aren't already at the lastresort. We've got a deficit that keeps growing. When do you get tothe resort that is the last one? We think you've got to face thisissue now,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
