Introduction and Background  </ITAG>This study addresses obstacles custodial parents encounter in attemptingto recover their children abducted by a noncustodial parent. Such custodialparents need help in overcoming the obstacles they encounter in regainingrightful custody of their children. These obstacles include but are notlimited to:andbullet; Locating the child;andbullet; State laws restricting police authority to take such a child intocustody;andbullet; Conflicting state laws regarding establishment of legal custody;andbullet; Situations in which the other parent may have civil custody; andandbullet; Costs associated with returning the child.  This experience is devastating, especially for the child and the legalparent. Recovery and return of such children to their legal parent is oneof the most complex legal problems in our society. The obstacles such parentsface are often virtually insurmountable. In some instances, legal parentsattempting to recover their child abducted by the noncustodial parent discoverthat the abducting parent has obtained custody in another state (that hascustodial provisions in conflict with those of the original State fromwhich the child was abducted). In other instances, legal parents who haveregained custodial rights do not have the necessary financial resourcesto cover the costs of returning the child home.  Some technical assistance and guidance is provided for parents attemptingto locate and recover their children. More help is needed. This study constitutesthe next step: A detailed, rigorous examination and documentation of theobstacles, in order to target remedial measures.  The Congress has directed OJJDP to undertake such a study. Section 408of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (JJDP Act), as amendedin 1988, directs the OJJDP Administrator to begin (within one year afterenactment of the Act: October 1, 1988) a study * * *<ITAG tagnum="21">To determine the obstacles that prevent or impede individuals whohave legal custody of children from recovering such children from parentswho have removed such children from such individuals in violation of law.</ITAG>A report on the results of this study is to be made by OJJDP to the Congressnot later than November 18, 1991.  The legislative history of the JJDP Act provides guidance upon the ``obstacles''to be addressed in the study. In its report on H.R. 1801, the <T3>Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendments of 1988, </T3>H.Report 100-605, 5 May, 1988, Committee on Education and Labor stated atp. 23 that the:<ITAG tagnum="21">Obstacles (preventing or impeding recovery) should include (but arenot limited to) those that are financial and legal (e.g., intrastate, interstate,or international).</ITAG>This study is expected to involve a review of the following types of information:andbullet; The legal requirements, policies, and procedures of public andprivate organizations that become involved in handling parental abductioncases; andbullet; Interstate Compacts that may eliminate interstate obstacles tothe return of abducted children; andbullet; State, custody provisions; andbullet; The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (with a particular focuson the use of Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution warrants); andbullet; The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International ChildAbduction (and its implementation in the U.S. through the InternationalChild Abduction Remedies Act). In addition, the study must include examination of actual parental abductioncases. Consideration should be given to comprehensive on-site studies ofselected jurisdictions_representative of problems/solutions parents, encounter/employin attempting to regain legal custody of their children. The study shouldinclude a detailed analysis of costs custodial parents experience in recoveringtheir children, together with recommended alternative sources of financialassistance. Efforts should be made to identify ameliorative measures that address therange of involved agencies, for example, schools, law enforcement, courts,and human services from the standpoint of their legal requirements, policies,procedures and practices.  Finally the project should address unique problems encountered by specialpopulations where different systems of justice are involved in the recoveryand return of such abducted children. These might include Indian parentsand parents in military families. Applicants should indicate those specialpopulations they propose to address and explain how they would do so. <T3>Related Projects. </T3>OJJDP is currently supporting five projectsthat are related to this study:  1. <T3>``Investigation and Prosecution of Parental Abduction Cases'' </T3>(GrantNo. 88-MC-CX-0011, 9/30/88_9/30/89, $99,989). Conducted by the NationalDistrict Attorneys Association (NDAA), the purpose of this project is toaddress the legal, jurisdictional and administrative issues faced by prosecutorsin cases of parent/family abductions.  The project consists of four stages:  <T3>State I. </T3>This stage involves legal research, including: (1) Areview of relevant case law and statutes, (2) the collection and reviewof existing information on prosecutorial handling of parent/family abductionsand related issues; and (3) a survey of prosecutors to identify effectiveapproaches to addressing issues in the area.  <T3>Stage II. </T3>During this stage NDAA will develop a trial manual andtraining curriculum for prosecutors responsible for handling parent/familyabduction cases.  <T3>Stage III. </T3>NDAA will provide training and technical assistanceto multi-disciplinary teams in four communities during this stage.  <T3>Stage IV. </T3>NDAA will develop and disseminate materials to facilitatereplication of effective approaches to investigating and prosecuting parentalabduction cases.2.<T3> ``National Study of Law Enforcement Policies and Practices RegardingMissing Children and Homeless Youth''.</T3> (Grant No. 86-MC-CX-K036, 9/9/86-9/30/89,$927,621.) Conducted by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and the URSAInstitute, this study is designed to improve the law enforcement responseto missing children and homeless youth cases. The project's activitiesinclude a determination of the extent of the missing child and homelessyouth problem as reported to law enforcement, the scope and variety oflaw enforcement policies and procedures that relate to missing children,and the effects of current policies and procedures on recovery of missingchildren. In addition, model programs will be designed and disseminatedto police and other juvenile justice agencies.As part of this project, RTI/URSA surveyed 1,060 state and local law enforcementagencies in 1987 regarding the numbers and types of missing children casesduring 1986 and departmental responses. During subsequent phases, the projectalso involved conducting interviews with law enforcement officials in selectedsites and conducting case studies of law enforcement handling of missingand homeless children.3.<T3> ``Reunification of Missing Children''.</T3> (Grant No. 88-MC-CX-K002,10/1/88-9/30/91, $174,840.) OJJDP is also supporting a new effort to developand test prototypical approaches to reunifying missing children, includingparentally abducted children, with their legal parents, and developingsolutions to problems parents and children encounter in this area. TheUniversity of California (UC) began this development program in October1988. It is designed to assess existing information regarding the reunificationof missing children; develop and test program models (based on researchand assessment of selected programs); and develop a dissemination strategy.4.<T3> ``National Center for Missing and Exploited Children''.</T3> (GrantNo. 86-MC-CX-K003, 11/14/85_3/31/89, $6,788,560.) During the past fouryears the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) hasbeen providing police, prosecutors, parents and legislators legal technicalassistance with regard to parental abductions. NCMEC's products in thisarea include:andbullet; Comprehensive digests of state laws relevant to child custodyorders, both civil and criminal;andbullet; A manual that is ``user friendly'' to parents, attorneys and policeon the steps that must be taken to conform to the laws and practices associatedwith parental custody disputes;andbullet; A manual on ``Selected State Legislation'' that includes technicallyaccurate and instructive directions and information to assist the userin reviewing state laws on custody and how to use various resources insearching for and locating a parentally kidnapped child;andbullet; A manual on ``Parental Kidnapping'' that contains a step-by-stepinstructional guide for parents who have experienced a family abduction,whether domestic or foreign; andandbullet; An instructive brochure_``Just in Case You Are Using the FederalLocator Service''_that assists a searching parent in using this resourceto locate a parent who may be the subject of a family abduction dispute.5.<T3> ``Missing and Exploited Children Comprehensive Action Program''.</T3>(Grant No. 88-MC-CX-K001, 9/30/88-9/30/91, $382,768.) The Public AdministrationService is conducting this project for OJJDP. The Missing and ExploitedChildren Comprehensive Action Program (M-CAP) is aimed at promoting thecoordination, concentration and direction of community resources to addressingthe problems of missing and exploited children. A strategic planning processwill be demonstrated in selected sites.The award recipient for the Study of Obstacles to the Recovery and Returnof Parentally Abducted Children will be required to coordinate its workwith these five OJJDP projects.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Program Goals</ITAG>andbullet; To identify and describe significant problems encountered by custodialparents attempting to recover their children abducted by a noncustodialparent;andbullet; To identify programs and strategies for eliminating such obstacles;andandbullet; To make recommendations for improving the handling of child abductionsby non-custodial parents.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Program Strategy</ITAG>A variety of agencies may be involved in the recovery and return process,including schools, police, prosecution, courts, child protection agenciesand private organizations.The role each plays in a particular parental abduction case is affectedby legal requirements, agency policies, procedures, and practices. Thesepoints should be kept in mind in relation to development of the strategyof this study.Section 408 of the JJDP Act, and the related legislative history suggestthat this study should emphasize the role of law enforcement, schools,and other human service agencies in the recovery and return of abductedchildren; and the <T3>civil</T3> process of assisting the legal parent in the recovery ofthe child from the abducting parent and return to the home. Furthermore,the NDAA project: ``Investigation and Prosecution of Parental AbductionCases'' addresses the governmental prosecution function.This program will be conducted in three discrete, incremental stages: (I)The research design stage, which involves the development of a researchmethodology for the assessment of obstacles to recovery and return of parentallyabducted children; (II) the data collection stage, in which data will becollected using the methodology developed in the previous stage; and (III)the data analysis and report preparation stage, which involves the analysisof the data and the preparation of reports that summarize the results ofthe study and provide recommendations for ameliorating obstacles encounteredby parents attempting to regain custody of their children abducted by anoncustodial parent.All technical and subject matter portions of the program will be guidedby recommendations of a project advisory committee established specificallyfor the program. The project advisory committee will provide comments andrecommendations regarding the strategies and activities for this program.It may be necessary to change or supplement project advisory committeemembers for different stages of the program. However, the objective willbe to select technical and subject matter experts capable of addressingissues related to each of the program stages. Thus the project advisorycommittee must have combined expertise in legal research in the parentalabduction area, experience in the recovery of parentally abducted children,and criminal/juvenile justice research and evaluation.The applicant must specify the necessary qualifications of the advisoryboard members, roles and responsibilities, anticipated tasks and levelof compensation. The composition of the board must reflect an appropriatebalance of skills and expertise (both programmatic and technical) and havea sufficient level of independence (i.e., no conflict of interest) to effectivelyadvise the project. It should consist of five members to ensure an appropriaterange of expertise.Stage I: Research DesignThe main objective of this stage is to review existing information relatedto significant obstacles encountered by custodial parents in the recoveryand return of their children, and to use this information in the developmentof a detailed research design for the data collection and analysis/reportingstages of the study. In developing the research design, applicants arestrongly encouraged to build on the information produced by the OJJDP projectsdescribed in the Introduction and Background Section. Applicants shouldaddress how this will be accomplished.Applicants must describe how the following activities will be performed.andbullet; Establish a project advisory committee;andbullet; Develop a plan for preparing the research design;andbullet; Review related literature, including materials developed by theOJJDP-supported projects identified in the Introduction and BackgroundSection;andbullet; Develop a research design;andbullet; Obtain project advisory committee review of the research design;andandbullet; Develop a dissemination strategy to inform the field of the statusof the project.<T3>Stage I Products.</T3> These research activities will result in threeproducts:andbullet; A plan for developing a research design that includes:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Research objectives;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A description of activities, including a literature review, the methodologyand a time/task plan; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Staff assignments</ITAG>andbullet; A literature review that describes and assesses existing informationon legal, policy, procedural and practical barriers for custodial parents.andbullet; A research design that specifies:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Objectives;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Definition of key concepts;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A sampling strategy for examining parental abduction cases;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A data collection plan;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Data analysis plans;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Anticipated reports; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A time/task plan for implementation.</ITAG>Stage II Activities: DataCollectionThe main objectives of Stage II are to: Collect information and data onthe nature and extent of significant obstacles to parental recovery andreturn of their abducted children, and on effective programs and strategies(including laws, policies, procedures and practices) for eliminating suchobstacles.Major activities during this stage include the following:andbullet; Preparation of a data collection plan;andbullet; Project advisory committee review and appropriate adjustmentsto methodology and/or data collection plans;andbullet; Data collection;andbullet; Data processing; andandbullet; Preparation of data and analysis.The major products to be completed during this stage are:andbullet; A data collection plan; andbullet; Data base prepared for analysis to include all necessary documentation;and andbullet; A dissemination strategy to inform the field of the status ofthe program. Stage III Activities: Data Analysis and Preparation of Report The main objectives of Stage III are to: analyze the data collected inthe course of examining actual cases representative of the most significantobstacles encountered by legal parents in recovering their abducted children,and prepare a set of reports that will communicate the findings to a varietyof audiences. A major product will be a description of the study and asummary of the results to be used by OJJDP in preparing a report for Congress.Applicants must describe how the following activities will be undertaken:andbullet; Preparation of a plan for report development; andbullet; Analysis of data; andbullet; Preparation of draft reports on analyses related to the researchobjectives; andbullet; Project advisory committee review of analysis and draft reports;and andbullet; Preparation of the final reports. The products to be completed under this stage are: andbullet; A plan for data analysis and preparation of reports that identifiesthe report to be prepared and the outline; andbullet; Draft reports; andbullet; The final reports; and andbullet; A dissemination strategy to inform the field of the results ofthe program. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Dollar Amount and Duration </ITAG>Up to $300,000 has been allocated for the initial award. One grant willbe awarded competitively, with an initial budget period of twelve (12)months.
