 Amongthe myths of federal government information technology contractsare that the government spends over $17 billion annually on suchcontracts (only about half that goes for outside contracts) andthat the federal government spends less than $17 billion on thecontracts (not all agencies are included in that figure, and noone knows how much those agencies spend).andP;  Other myths are thatthe government does not spend enough on information technology (itoverspends compared to the private sector), that government ISspending will decrease (maintenance and upgrades of existingsystems will continue) and that IBM dominates the federal market(Unisys leads in dollar value, and DEC has more total computers inplace).andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     National GovernmentMISGovernment AgencyGovernment ContractsMarket AnalysisOutlookEquipment Acquisition.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Don't Bet Your Life on Computer Researchers' DataandM;George Bernard Shaw once remarked that if all the economists in the worldwere laid end to end, they wouldn't reach a conclusion.andP;  The same might besaid of the market analysts and technology forecasters who follow thegovernment marketplace.andM;Figures can't lie but liars can figure, the old saying goes.andP;  Although themarket data served up by computer researchers is produced in good faith, thefigures -- and conclusions based upon them -- often are grossly misleading.andM;Though I must admit to snoring through some of these presentations, I haveseen enough data to identify several recurring misinterpretation of federalinformation technology spending patterns.andP;  Herewith are a few of these&quot;myths.&quot;andM;Myth: The federal government is spending more than $17 billion a year oninformation technology contracts.andM;Reality: This commonly used figure is based on agency budget data for fiscalyear 1989 as published by the Office of Management and Budget.andP;  However, thisfigure reflects &quot;total obligations&quot; for information systems.andP;  Only about halfthe $17 billion figure reported goes for outside contracts.andP;  A largepercentage is allocated to such internal costs as salaries for agencycomputer people.andM;Myth: The federal government is spending less than $17 billion a year oninformation technology contracts.andM;Reality: That's wrong too.andP;  Though the OMB data shows only about $10 billiongoing for &quot;commercial services,&quot; all the official budget figures areseriously understated for two main reasons.andM;First, they do not include agencies such as the Postal Service, TennesseeValley Authority, the Government Printing Office and Congress.andP;  Second, thedefinition of ADP and communications used to compile annual budget data doesnot include computers and software &quot;embedded&quot; in weapons systems.andM;How much the unreported agencies are spending is anybody's guess.andP;  I haveseen spending estimates for embedded and other excluded Defense Departmentsystems ranging between $20 billion and $50 billion.andP;  It would be aconservative guess that federal spending for computer and communicationsproducts and service is at least $30 billion a year.andM;Myth: The government isn't spending enough on information technology.andM;Reality: A good case can be made for more spending when one looks at theproblems of information-intensive agencies like the Internal Revenue Service,but it is specious to compare spending ratios of federal agencies to those ofFortune 500 companies.andM;For one thing, industry analysts usually compute privat-sector spending forinformation technology as a percentage of gross sales, and obviously there isno comparable benchmark for federal agencies.andM;Looking at information resources management spending as a percentage of theagency's program budget would yield one figure.andP;  The same expenditures as apercentage of the &quot;administrative&quot; budget would produce another.andP;  Neitherwould be a valid basis for comparisons with companies whose spending ratiosvary widely from industry to industry.andM;Myth: There's going to be a big turndown in government spending forinformation systems.andM;Reality: Even when one takes into account the probable curtailment of majordefense programs, there's still no need to push the panic button.andP;  The bulkof the government's spending goes for information processing applicationsthat still have to be maintained and upgraded.andM;Over the past decade of supposed budgetary austerity, there has been a steadyyear-by-year increase in OMB's published figures, from around $9 billion infiscal 1982 to $17 billion in fiscal 1989.andM;Unless someone decides to bring back Jimmy Carter and zero-based budgeting,it's unlikely that ths spending pattern will be reversed.andM;Myth: The government should spend more to upgrade its obsolete computersystems.andM;Reality: This one is the all-time winner in terms of persistence, having itsbasis in a December 1980 GAO report that the Grace Commission resuscitated inthe mid-1980s.andP;  Recent data shows that the federal government and privatesector are about on a par with respect to the age of their mainframe andminicomputer technology.andP;  When it comes to microcomputers, there is probableparity also.andM;Myth: IBM Corp. dominates the federal marketplace the way it does the privatesector.andM;Reality: Despite the brouhaha over &quot;endemic bias &quot;toward IBM by the Navy andother agencies, the fact is that IBM is not, and never has been, the dominantmainframe supplier to the federal government.andP;  That distinction goes toUnisys Corp. with respect to dollar value of computer gear, and to DigitalEquipment Corp. with respect to number of computers.andM;When I look at all the questionable data being dished out by &quot;experts&quot; on thefederal government computer marketplace, I can't help but recall the story ofthe statistician who drowned while walking across a pond with an averagedepth of 3 feet.andM;Robert V.
