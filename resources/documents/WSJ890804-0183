The financial service and casualty insurance company said net income in the second quarter fell to $23.7 million, or $1.15 a share, from $38.2 million, or $1.85 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.    The company said weather-related damages, including a Midwest tornado earlier this year, cost the company about $8 million in payouts compared with about $2.4 million in the year-earlier period.    In the first six months, profit dropped 40% to $39.3 million, or $1.91 cents a share, from $64.1 million, or $3.11 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The decline, the company said, was also caused by natural disasters. </TEXT></DOC>
