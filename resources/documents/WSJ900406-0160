Fearing a federal ban on the use of these chemicals inmanufacturing, many of the nation's largest high-technologyconcerns are scrambling for substitutes. InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., the world's largest electronicsmanufacturer, pledges to eliminate the chemicals, known aschlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by the end of 1993. Most otherlarge electronics manufacturers have less ambitious plans,but only a few have refused to join the war on CFCs.</LP><TEXT>   For high-technology companies, kicking the CFC habit isn'teasy. The most popular type of CFC, 113, turns up in morethan 100 different high-tech manufacturing processes, fromcleaning freshly soldered circuit boards to etching a chipdesign into a silicon wafer.   &quot;With all these different uses, finding one magic snakeoil to replace them is very difficult,&quot; said David Chittick,American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s vice president forengineering and safety. Mr. Chittick, who also heads a newindustry cooperative attempting to spur cuts in CFC use, saidtechnical difficulties &quot;have made a number of companiesreluctant to pledge to completely eliminate CFCs from themanufacturing operations.&quot;   Progress is being made. Since the start of 1988, IBM hascut CFC emissions by 31%. ATandamp;T is cutting its use by makingsome of its circuit boards with a process that doesn'trequire the removal of excess solder; for some otherprocesses it is switching to a cleanser derived from citrusrinds.   And Digital Equipment Corp., one of the biggest computermakers, has devised a way to clean the most advanced type ofcircuit boards, using so-called surface-mount technology,with a water solution that eliminates the need for CFCs.Digital had said it will offer for free to other high-techmanufacturers directions on how to use and make the newsolvent.   CFCs, which also are used in Styrofoam containers,automobile air conditioners and refrigerators, are blamed fordepleting the earth's atmospheric ozone layer. Scientistsbelieve &quot;holes&quot; in the ozone, created by CFCs, increase thepossibility of skin cancer by letting in more ultravioletradiation.   The industry's decision to rely more heavily in the 1980son the ozone-eating chemical is harshly criticized by someobservers.   Defenders of the electronics industry concede that itshould have moved more swiftly to curb CFC use. &quot;Should wehave done something {to cut back} sooner? In hindsight, weshould have,&quot; said Cheryl Russell, a lobbyist for theAmerican Electronics Association, an influential trade groupthat advocates a 50% cut in CFC emissions by 1993.   But Ms. Russell said the industry had good reasons forembracing one type of CFC, 113, even after the alarm bellsbegan to sound. An effective cleanser, CFC-113 was popularwith electronics manufacturers because it posed fewer, ifany, hazards to workers than traditional solvents and waseasily handled and stored, she said.   As a result, CFC-113 won out in a push to rid the industryof other, patently hazardous chemicals, includingcancer-causing agents.   Even now, many companies are slow to move forward with CFCsubstitutes because of uncertainties about theireffectiveness. &quot;We recognize CFCs must go, but we want along-term fix. We don't want to try {a substitute} out andfind it doesn't work,&quot; said Cliff Bast, who heads a CFC taskforce at Hewlett-Packard Co., which manufactures medicalinstruments, computers and related products. Through variousconservation measures, H-P did cut its use of CFCs by 8% inthe fourth quarter of last year.   Other electronics manufacturers say they haven't yetidentified substitutes for some processes. &quot;We haven't foundany acceptable substitute for critical cleaning needs,&quot; saida spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a semiconductormaker.   But given the prevailing political winds, the high-techindustry won't have CFCs around for long. In January, thefederal government placed a hefty tax on new purchases andexisting inventories of CFCs. And on Tuesday, the Senatepassed a comprehensive clean-air bill that, among things,calls for a phase-out of CFCs. The House may pass an eventougher provision restricting CFCs.</TEXT></DOC>
