<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0958 </DOCNO><TEXT>One of the latest arms control initiatives being debated outside the governmentis a proposal for a complete ban on the testing of ballistic missiles.The ban is not a new idea, but recently it has been given greater visibilitythrough the endorsement of the initiative by all but one of the Democraticpresidential candidates. Its proponents assert that a flight test banwill prevent destabilizing modernizations of ballistic-missile technology,thereby decreasing the preemptive nuclear attack threat to US. ICBMsand strategic bomber forces, lessening incentives to launch a first strike,and adding overall to crisis and arms race stability. Closer analysissuggests, however, that although some flight-test restrictions couldprove to be a useful component of a broader arms control regime, a totalban on ballistic-missile flight tests is unlikely to produce anythinglike the dramatic benefits claimed. It would block important programsneeded to maintain stable deterrence, would present a number of verificationproblems, and would divert the superpowers from pursuing more fruitfuland effective arms-control measures.</TEXT></DOC>
