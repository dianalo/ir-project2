Traders said the intervention took some momentum out of the dollar's recent rally.    The dollar traded higher in Asia and Europe early Monday, hitting peaks of 1.8300 marks and 131.70 yen near the close of the Tokyo session, largely because it appeared central banks would continue to hold off from acting to stem the dollar's ascent.    Early in the New York trading day, however, the Fed was sighted selling dollars for marks at around the 1.8210 marks level, according to dealers. The dollar slipped as low as 1.8145 marks and 130.90 yen after the reported intervention.    A spokesman for the Fed would neither confirm nor deny the central bank had intervened, as is its usual policy.    During the New York afternoon, the dollar recovered to levels above those at which the central bank reportedly intervened. Traders expressed surprise at the dollar's resilience, but said the move higher was on very thin volume.    Late in the New York day, the dollar was quoted at 1.8218 marks, up from 1.8130 marks late Friday, and at 131.15 yen, up from 130.45 yen.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar opened at 130.48 yen.    The dollar also posted sharp gains against the pound Monday, which fell to $1.7023 from $1.7270 late Friday. The pound was hurt by news that Britain's trade deficit unexpectedly widened to a record #1.705 billion ($2.94 billion) in May from #1.228 billion in April. Forecasts had been for a deficit of between #450 million and #800 million. The current account gap widened to a record #1.205 billion in May from a revised #728 million in April. Economic forecasters had expected the gap to total about #600 million in May.    Traders said the Fed intervention wasn't particularly aggressive, but was sufficient to give pause to a market that was already jittery over the dollar's steep climb of the past few weeks.    &quot;The market's getting hesitant about pushing the dollar to higher levels because of the extent and the velocity of the run it has had,&quot; said Jeffrey Mondschein, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s Merrill Lynch Capital Market Group.    Like others, Mr. Mondschein said the intervention &quot;wasn't too convincing,&quot; but was well-timed. &quot;It was an appropriate time for intervention -- the market was looking to back off anyway, and that's when you get the most out of intervention.&quot;    Still, some traders say the market will try to take the dollar higher to test the resolve of central banks. They said Monday's action appeared to be the Fed acting alone, rather than in concert with other central banks.    Carol Callanan, assistant vice president at Credit Lyonnais, said the Fed intervention hadn't been &quot;aggressive or effective.&quot; But she said caution by traders could prompt some profit-taking ahead of the long July 4 weekend in the U.S. and the release of U.S. trade data for May next July 15.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, current-delivery gold was unchanged at $443 an ounce. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.7 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $443.90 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Monday, June 27, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
