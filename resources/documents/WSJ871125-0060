The microwave and cable-television transmission concern said it will use the funds to repay debt. The company said most of the service agreements were to be in effect through 1994 and provided about 10% of Western's microwave revenue, or about $381,700 a month. United Telecommunications, based in Kansas City, Mo., is a partner in US Sprint, a telecommunications network.    Western said that the latest termination is one of several related to long-distance concerns switching to use of fiber-optics networks from microwave transmission. The company said cancellations in 1987 have equaled about one-third of its microwave revenue.    Microwave-transmission revenue comprises about 50% of Western's total revenue. For the nine months, Western had profit from continuing operations of $4.7 million, or 55 cents a share, on revenue of $70.9 million.    The company said it will continue to write down the value of its microwave routes in conjunction with the terminations. </TEXT></DOC>
