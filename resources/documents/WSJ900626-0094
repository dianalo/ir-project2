Elderly farmwomen no longer get together once a week for coffee. Boyhoodfriends shun each other.   Resentments are eroding even the most enduring rite ofrural life, the wave hello. Farmers sometimes pass onChippewa County 17 without even a nod of acknowledgement.</LP><TEXT>   What caused this rupture? Sugar.   Residents of this heartland hamlet (population 428) areembroiled in a modern-day range war, this one pitting the&quot;beeters&quot; -- the sugar beet growers -- against theirgrain-farming neighbors. Many farmers fume that the richbeeters are getting richer at their expense -- thanks topreferential treatment by the federal government.   Across a broad swath of southern Minnesota and elsewhere,beeters, flush with sugar profits, are outbidding otherfarmers whenever land is rented or a farm is sold. They aredriving up land prices and rents, and crowding less fortunatefarmers off the land. &quot;We've lost a whole generation of youngfarmers,&quot; asserts Owen Gustafson, a Maynard grain grower anda leader of Fair Farm Policy, a group protesting &quot;inequities&quot;of sugar subsidies.   The protests extend to international trade negotiationsand Congress, where the sugar program is under sharp attackas lawmakers debate the 1990 farm bill. Arguably, it's thesweetest deal in American agriculture: The government propsup domestic sugar prices by curtailing imports of lower-costsugar. Producers are guaranteed a &quot;market stabilizationprice&quot; of 22 cents a pound, about nine cents higher than thecurrent world market price.   The result: Although some other crops are also subsidized,sugar beets often bring growers four times more per acre thanwheat and corn. Large beeters here reap $100,000 to $200,000each in annual sugar benefits. That's not money from thegovernment, but from consumers in the form of higher prices.Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana claims this &quot;hiddentax&quot; costs consumers $2.4 billion a year -- although sugargrowers contend the figure is far-fetched.   &quot;That's super-welfare -- that isn't a safety net,&quot; saysThomas Hammer, chief lobbyist for major sweetener users,which are allied with Fair Farm Policy in seeking cutbacks insugar price supports.   Counters Irvin Zitterkopf, president of Southern MinnesotaBeet Sugar Cooperative: &quot;We aren't making as much as some ofthe people using our products, like candy makers and cerealpeople.&quot;   For the farmers in this area, the debate taking place inWashington couldn't hit closer to home. &quot;What we're trying todo is save our hides,&quot; says 51-year-old David Hovda, aRenville County cattle feeder. &quot;They {the beeters} havereally been endowed by the government. . . . They're going todrive us all out.&quot;   In Maynard and nearby Clara City and other small towns,widespread fear for the future, edged by envy of wealthyneighbors, is turning farmer against farmer, family againstfamily -- even dividing families.   Marvin Freiborg, a member of a large family of beetgrowers who himself worked with hogs, assailed the sugarprogram two months ago in a letter to the editor of the ClaraCity Herald. &quot;I've kept quiet longer than I should have,&quot; hewrote. &quot;I'm tired of watching the majority of beet growersoutbid neighbors on land, expand their operations year afteryear, drive nice pickups, buy new equipment. . . .&quot;   &quot;My mom was just disgusted with me,&quot; says Mr. Freiborg,who had to give up his land last fall when his landlordraised the rent. &quot;But I told the truth about what'shappening. I had an awful lot of people call me, thanking me.They're just too timid to speak out.&quot;   The range war has been building for several years. Itbroke out into the open here when Mr. Gustafson, 39 yearsold, went to Washington early last year to protest the sugarprogram. He and his brother, Philip, have lost three piecesof rented land totaling 488 acres to higher-bidding beeterssince 1985.   Driving home one night, Mr. Gustafson passes a gentlyswelling field, 160 acres of soft black earth under a canopyof stars. He and his brother had rented it for $63 an acreper year. It was sold last year, and the new owner rented itto a big beet grower from the town of Sacred Heart for morethan $100 an acre. &quot;There's no way we can pay that,&quot; he says.What's more, the Gustafsons aren't members of the localcooperative, so they can't profitably switch to growing sugarbeets.   Accompanying Mr. Gustafson to Washington was an equallyfeisty neighbor, Ronald Carpenter, 43, who says that when heshowed up at a land-rent auction here at LaRae's Cafe, aloneamong 20 beeters, &quot;They laughed at me. They knew I couldn'tafford the cash rent. I bid just to run up the price.&quot;   Soon after the men returned from Washington, vandals brokeinto Mr. Carpenter's machine shed while he and his familyslept. They dumped sugar into the gas tank of a tractor andspray-painted farm equipment with graffiti like this, stillemblazoned on the side of his old pickup: &quot;We Love Sugar.&quot;   On Maynard's main street, business at the Hair Affair, thebeauty salon run by Mr. Carpenter's wife, Mary Ann, hasfallen 50% from last year because of a boycott by some wivesand daughters of beeters.   Her mother-in-law's coffee klatch has broken up. &quot;She usedto have coffee once a week with neighbor ladies,&quot; says Mrs.Carpenter. &quot;They had been friends for 40 years. They juststopped calling.&quot;   The dispute is two-sided. &quot;One farmer purposely sprayedherbicide so that the wind would drift it into the end rowsof a beet field and kill the beets,&quot; says the Rev. MartinScott Lucin, co-pastor of Immanuel Lutheran Church in ClaraCity.   Nobody is more troubled about the schism than thesmall-town ministers, who have been trying to help theantagonists better understand each other. In a sermon lastyear, the Rev. Ronald Duty, pastor of the Maynard LutheranChurch, admonished his parishioners: &quot;When we are jealous ofanother's prosperity or greedy for their land, instead ofhelping them to preserve their economic livelihoods . . . wedo damage to the human community.&quot;   But for now, neither side is in the mood forreconciliation. Mr. Lucin recounts a farmhouse visit lastyear to a man dying of cancer: &quot;He looked out the window andhe vowed, `The sugar beet guys aren't coming over here evenafter I'm gone.'&quot;   Wayne Schwitters, a Clara City beet grower, telling of alost friendship with a local farmer, chokes up and looksaway: &quot;Him and I can't talk in church.&quot;   The rancor saddens Mr. Schwitters, one of the biggest beetgrowers in an area homesteaded a century ago by immigrantsodbusters, mostly from Scandinavia and Germany. &quot;I feelsorry for those people raising corn and soybeans,&quot; says the48-year-old farmer. &quot;I think in reality corn and beans areway too cheap, and they are having a tough time.&quot;   Sugar also is making things tense in the Red River Valleyalong the Minnesota-North Dakota border. &quot;Wheat farmers arestarting to hate sugar beet growers,&quot; says Jacob Bakke, anelevator manager in Prosper, N.D. &quot;It's unfair that they arejust breaking even and the beet growers are making bigbucks.&quot;   And in southern Louisiana, the expansion of sugar-caneplanters is raising tempers in Cajun country. &quot;These guys netmore than I can gross per acre,&quot; complains Bill Burley, asoybean grower in Youngsville, La.   Economic dislocations from the sugar program extend farbeyond the Farm Belt. To guarantee U.S. sugar cane and beetgrowers the market-stabilization price, the governmentslashed imports of raw sugar to 1.25 million tons last yearfrom four million a decade ago. Critics of the sugar programsay this has deprived numerous sugar-producing nations in theCaribbean, Latin America and Far East of export earnings,harmed their economies and caused political instability,while increasing Third World demand for U.S. foreign aid.   At home, the sugar program has helped make possible thespectacular rise of the high-fructose corn syrup industry --to the point that Americans now consume more corn sweetenerthan refined sugar. The syrup industry itself is not coveredby the U.S. program. But by pegging their prices just belowthe sugar support price, corn-sweetener producers capturednot only market share but huge profits.   Sugar producers contend that the program protects U.S.consumers from wild swings in world sugar prices whileshielding the producers from the sugar-dumping practices ofexporters, particularly the European Community, which heavilysubsidizes production.   Minnesota and North Dakota beet growers say they wouldn'tmind fending for themselves in a free market, but only if allsugar producers were put on equal competitive footing aroundthe world.   The sugar program is under broad attack. At the urging ofAustralia, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade hasdecreed U.S. sugar-import quotas illegal. The Bushadministration appears ready to phase out the sugar programand other forms of protectionism in its quest for abreakthrough GATT agreement to end trade-distorting farmsubsidies.   In Congress, strong bipartisan support is building for anoverhaul of the sugar program, beginning with a 10% cut insugar price supports.   Opposing change is Big Sugar's lobby and its phalanx ofpolitical-action committees, long fabled on Capitol Hill fortheir generosity. From 1983 through mid-1989, sugar andcorn-sweetener lobbyists supported their pitches to membersof Congress with $3.3 million in campaign contributions,according to an analysis of Federal Election Commissionrecords by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, aWashington-based consumer group.   That's a lot of money from about 10,000 beet growers inthe Midwest and the West; 1,000 cane producers, dominated bya few big sugar planters and corporations in Florida,Louisiana and Hawaii; plus a handful of sugar processors andcorn refiners. But they can afford it.   Two of the biggest beneficiaries of the sugar program arethe U.S. Sugar Corp. and the Cuban-born Fanjul family of PalmBeach, Fla., led by Jose (Pepe) Fanjul, who contributed$100,000 toward Republican campaigns in 1988 alone, and hisbrother Alfonso, who is similarly generous toward DemocraticParty endeavors. Between them, U.S. Sugar, based in the sugarmill town of Clewiston, Fla., and the Fanjul corporate empirecontrol more than 60% of Florida's cane acreage and producemore than 25% of the nation's cane sugar. Together theycollected what the sweetener-users group calls a &quot;windfall&quot;of $180 million in sugar benefits last year.   Here in southern Minnesota, beet growers such as Mr.Schwitters say that other farmers could be growing beets ifthey hadn't passed up chances to buy shares in the SouthernMinnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative in 1974, when it wasorganized, and four years later, when it was rescued fromruin by a government-guaranteed $11.5 million bailout.   To grow sugar beets, farmers must join the cooperative,which is the only processor in the area. But for mostfarmers, the cost of joining -- currently at $900 per share-- is prohibitive, and the number of shares available islimited. (Typically, one share entitles a farmer to plant oneacre of beets.) Many of the transactions occur betweenmembers of beet-growing families. With the future of thesugar program in doubt, other farmers would have troublegetting financing for a new co-op.   Mr. Schwitters's rewards for taking the initial risk? Adiamond-studded stickpin in his tie. A 3,800-acre farmingoperation, including 1,700 acres of beets. Seven hired handsand seven families of migrant farm workers. A big house withtwo-story cathedral ceilings and a veranda where, his wifeJan says, &quot;it's fun to sit and see the crops coming up andthe migrants working out there.&quot;   Similarly rewarded are 330 other co-op shareholders. Lastyear, they reaped an estimated $35 million in sugarprice-support benefits.   Wheat, corn and some other crops are subsidized, but theyaren't protected by federal import controls as sugar is. AFair Farm Policy study of Minnesota farm data calculates thatthe beet growers made an average profit of $206.40 an acrefrom 1984 through 1988 -- about eight times what corn andsoybeans brought in at $25.53 and $25.94, respectively.   The beet growers say that profit figure is greatlyexaggerated, although Mr. Schwitters concedes that beetersearn more per acre than other farmers. &quot;By golly, if Ididn't, I'd quit,&quot; he says. &quot;It's a lot more work. It's aspecialized crop.&quot;   The beet growers also maintain that local land prices andrents haven't gone up nearly as much as the opposition says.&quot;Yes, there are rents in excess of $100&quot; an acre, saysWilliam Rudeen, a beet grower near Bird Island, Minn., andcurrent cooperative chairman. &quot;But we're too small to havethe impact they say we have.&quot;   Their neighbors also are irritated that the beeters, inaddition to sugar benefits, also collect wheat and feed-grainsubsidies for the part of their land devoted to those crops.   But while the government limits subsidized grain acreageeach year to try to prevent surpluses, beeters can plant asmany beets as the cooperative's plant in Renville canprocess. The result: Sheltered from foreign competition to agreat extent, they have expanded their beet acreage over 50%since the cooperative started.   The disparity deepens the local rifts, and merchants areunder pressure to take sides. &quot;It's a tough fence to sit,&quot;acknowledges one farmer, Rolan Ammermann. His father-in-law,a Clara City insurance agent, was aghast to hear from a beetgrower that Mr. Ammermann was baling oat straw for thebeeters' arch-foe, Ron Carpenter. Alarmed about appearances,his father-in-law called him up. &quot;It's got real tense for awhile,&quot; says Mr. Ammermann. &quot;I just told him it's a businessdeal.&quot;   Also caught in the middle are landlords, including retiredfarmers and widows. One young farmer, Randy Berends, has beenall but dispossessed because he can't afford to rent hisretiring father's 320 acres at $105 an acre. All he figureshe can afford is $70.   &quot;You can't blame the landlords for taking top dollar,&quot; hesays. &quot;It would have been crazy for Dad to rent to me.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
