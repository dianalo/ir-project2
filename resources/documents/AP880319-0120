The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision Friday,reversed a December ruling by U.S. District Judge Diana Murphy thatenjoined Northwest from imposing new wages and work rules and andordered the parties to federal mediation.   The appellate ruling is a defeat for the InternationalAssociation of Machinists, which represents the mechanics and hadsought to include them in negotiations covering another 7,000employees who operate under two other contracts.   Terry Erskine, vice president for law and labor relations forthe Minneapolis-based airline, said Friday night that Northwestofficials have not yet decided whether to impose new work rules inlight of the appeals court ruling.   It's not clear whether the ruling will have any impact on theunion's ability to support a possible walkout by Northwest's 6,700flight attendants who have threatened to strike at midnight March29.   Talks with the flight attendants also have stalled, andNorthwest has announced plans to impose new contract terms on themApril 1.   Under the Railway Labor Act, which governs collective bargainingin the airline and railroad industries, the 2,900 mechanics remainfree to strike.   In a related development, Erskine said Northwest askedmachinists union International President William Winpisinger toclarify the union's position on a sympathy strike. Local unionofficers implied earlier in the week that they would support aflight attendant walkout.   Erskine said a union attorney wrote Northwest on Wednesday andacknowledged that the machinists cannot call a formal sympathystrike. That also is the position of Guy Cook, the union's generalpresident in Minneapolis, the Star Tribune reported Saturday,quoting unidentified sources who also said that individual unionmembers are free to honor another union's picket lines.   Cook, who was out of town, did not return a reporter's phonecall Saturday.   Friday's court ruling was a setback for the union's efforts tokeep its 10,000 mechanics, baggage handlers and cleaners in one setof contract talks. Another 10,000 members work under a separatecontract that does not open for negotiations until 1989.   The legal issue addressed Friday stems from Northwest's effortsto negotiate transition agreements with the union in the wake ofits 1986 acquisition of Republic Airlines.   When Northwest announced plans to impose new terms on the 2,900mechanics in October, the union asked for federal mediationinvolving all 10,000 employees whose contracts would be undernegotiation in 1987 and 1988. Murphy said Northwest should notimpose new terms before going to mediation.   The appeals panel, however, said the National Mediation Boarddoes not have authority to adjudicate the question and that theunion's request for mediation was improper.   A machinists spokesman said the union had not yet decidedwhether to appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
