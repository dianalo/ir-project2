The purchase of jets made by Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp.and Europe's Airbus Industrie is the largest civilian aircraftorder ever, topping Delta Air Lines' $10.5 billion order for up to225 Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft last September.   The Delta order was followed by other huge purchases, as severalU.S. airlines scrambled to buy new planes.   At news conferences in New York, London and Paris, GPA officialssaid the leasing company had placed firm orders for 121 new planesand had taken options on another 187, most of which are likely tobe exercised.   GPA, based in Shannon, Ireland, is one of the world's biggestaircraft leasing firms. Its leading rivals include InternationalLease Finance Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Ansett TransportIndustries Ltd., a huge Australian company that is half-owned bymedia tycoon Rupert Murdoch.   GPA's order reflects the growing importance of aircraft leasingcompanies, which account for about one-fifth of all aircraftorders. It also underscores the airlines' concern about replacingtheir aging fleets.   Boeing is the major beneficiary of the orders. GPA said it willbuy 182 Boeing airplanes for $9.4 billion, comprised of 92 Boeing737 narrow-body, twin-jet planes, 50 Boeing 757 narrow-bodytwin-jet models and 40 Boeing 767 twin-engine wide-body jets.   GPA will pay McDonnell Douglas $3.1 billion for 64 MD-80narrow-body twin-jets and 8 MD-11 wide-body, three-engine jets.   The leasing company also is ordering $4.3 billion worth ofairplanes from Airbus Industrie, a European aircraft manufacturingconsortium. GPA will buy 30 Airbus A320s, 10 A330s and two A340s.In addition, the company took options on another 10 A330s and twoA340s.   GPA plans to take delivery of 80 to 100 new planes a year overthe next six to seven years.   GPA said the engine suppliers include CFMI, a joint venture ofGeneral Electric Co. of the United States and France's SocieteNationale d'Etudes et Construction de Moteurs Aviation; GeneralElectric; United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt and Whitney;Rolls-Royce PLC, and International Aero Engines, jointly owned byUnited Technologies, Daimler-Benz AG and Rolls-Royce.   ``This significant commitment means that we expect to purchaseabout 10 percent of all of the commercial jet aircraft deliveredthrough the mid-1990s,'' GPA Chairman and Chief Executive T.A. Ryantold reporters in New York. ``We will thus maintain our leadershipand dominant market share of the new aircraft operating leasebusiness which continues to grow rapidly.''   Aircraft leasing fills the gap between manufacturers unable tokeep up with demand and airlines in a hurry to get planes to staycompetitive. Lessors like GPA buy up batches of different kinds ofplanes and lease them to carriers in a pinch.   ``For the first time, it provides massive flexibility for theairlines and particularly the smaller carriers,'' Ryan said. ``Theairline business is going to increase and the number of passengersis going to increase very dramatically.''   The average length of a GPA operating lease is 6{ years. Itsrelatively young fleet of planes are an average 3 years old,compared with around 12 years for jetliners operated by U.S.carriers.   Ryan said the financing for the purchases will be provided by agroup of U.S. and Japanese banks led by Citibank.   GPA, one of Ireland's largest firms, is privately owned byseveral companies, including Air Canada, the Irish airline AerLingus, Prudential Insurance of the United States and MitsubishiTrust Bank of Japan. Air Canada and Aer Lingus hold stakes of 16percent ats for 1988-1989 are expected to total $150 million, upfrom $101 million in the previous fiscal year.</TEXT></DOC>
