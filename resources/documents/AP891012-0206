The skeleton of Andrea Marion Childers, who was 19 when shedisappeared in 1983, was found Wednesday by a worker cutting brushjust 50 yards from where three other victims had been uncovered sixyears ago near Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.   Police believe the killer in the nation's worst unsolvedserial-murder case has not operated in the Seattle area since 1984.In addition to the 41 known victims, eight young missing women arelisted as presumed victims.   Ms. Childers had not been on that missing list, but the GreenRiver Task Force had information about her because she was reportedmissing in 1983, said King County Police Capt. Robert Evans, thetask force commander.   Investigators weren't surprised that she turned out to be aGreen River victim and that her skeleton was found in an areaheavily searched previously, Evans said.   ``If you go back to our experience with recovering bodies _waiting two years before a family member calls and says, `I thinkyou ought to look at this' _ it's just not unexpected anymore. ...Everything has some sort of a bizarre twist.''   Few personal details about Ms. Childers were available, butEvans said she fit the profile of other Green River victims. Thosekilled were young women, most with links to prostitution.   Seattle police had at least one contact with Ms. Childers, whenthey arrested her on March 14, 1983, on a prostitution charge,Seattle police spokesman Mark Amundson said.   One month later, Edmonds, Wash., police received a missingperson report about Ms. Childers. She was last seen by herboyfriend as she was on her way to a shopping area frequented byprostitutes near the airport, police said.   Many Green River victims were known to frequent the ``Sea-Tacstrip'' near the airport south of Seattle.   ``The time of disappearance, what little we know now about thebackground of the victim is similar to a lot of our victims,''Evans said. ``The location ... the circumstances of the foundvictim, those kinds of things are certainly indicative of a GreenRiver victim.''   The missing person report on Ms. Childers was among hundredsthat Green River investigators had collected as they strove toidentify several victims found earlier.   However, Edmonds police later withdrew the missing-personreport, saying a witness had reported seeing Ms. Childers crossingthe Canadian border.   The Green River killings occurred from the summer of 1982 toearly 1984. The killer operated primarily in the Puget Sound area;the bodies of the first five victims were found near the GreenRiver, giving the case its name.   No arrests have been made, but William J. Stevens II, 38, ofSpokane, has been described by task force investigators as a``viable suspect.'' He has been jailed in Spokane on federalweapons charges but he has not been charged in connection with theGreen River killings.</TEXT></DOC>
