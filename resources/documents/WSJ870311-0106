They would be surprised to learn that people of such conflicting views as Winnie Mandela, Gatsha Buthelezi and novelist Alan Paton all agree on one thing: A bestselling book in South Africa may offer a workable framework for a peaceful, post-apartheid society.    &quot;South Africa: The Solution&quot; by Frances Kendall and Leon Louw has sold over 25,000 copies since last year. As Ms. Kendall and Mr. Louw see it, South Africa's central government is like a big, lumbering tank. White bureaucrats are in the driver's seat and blacks rightly fear what the tank's weapons can do to them. Many want to storm the tank and take it over. But if the history of other African nations is any guide, whites, Indians and small black tribes should fear that.    Ms. Kendall and Mr. Louw believe that a radical decentralization of the current all-powerful national government is a must if the polyglot populations of South Africa are to feel secure. Drawing on a federal system similar to that of the early U.S. and the current Swiss canton arrangement, they show how the rights of every South African can be protected and civil war avoided.    The authors envision a democratic system of &quot;one man, many votes&quot; in which most political decisions would be made at a local level. All race and economic restrictions would be repealed and each &quot;state&quot; would, as in the U.S. Senate, be represented equally in a national parliament whose powers would be limited to defense and the protection of rights.    Individual cantons would handle most government functions -- including public education, police and courts. Blacks, Indians and coloreds would have equal political rights with whites, but if one group tried to dominate an area, the right of free emigration between cantons would curb such tendencies.    In a surprising foreword to the book, Winnie Mandela, wife of imprisoned African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, writes that it is an &quot;extraordinary and long overdue challenge to South Africa. . . . {The authors} offer South Africa what she needs most -- a broad alternative we have been looking for. . . . Here lies hope for a shattered nation . . . from a voice white South Africa will listen to without fear.&quot; Gatsha Buthelezi, the leader of six million Zulus and someone often at odds with Mrs. Mandela, is also enthusiastic, as is Alan Paton, author of the anti-apartheid novel &quot;Cry the Beloved Country.&quot;    &quot;The Solution&quot; is also having a political impact. Desmond Clarence, chairman of the indaba, a commission that has proposed a multiracial, power-sharing arrangement for the province of Natal, says the indaba was influenced by the Swiss example and that Ms. Kendall and Mr. Louw were among the few people called to testify. And as reported by the Journal's Roger Thurow last week, Ciskei, a tiny, impoverished black &quot;homeland,&quot; is reaping the benefits of the local autonomy already allowed. Deregulation and a top marginal tax rate of 15% have led to the creation of 23,000 new jobs, record tax revenues and a growth rate of more than 6% in 1986, while the rest of the country had zero growth.    U.S. policy makers, who are now acutely aware of the failure of sanctions, should acquaint themselves with this book's vision of the future (San Francisco's Institute for Contemporary Studies will publish the U.S. edition this spring). It isn't enough for Americans to back a transfer of power in South Africa from a minority to a majority. The U.S. must support a solution that creates lasting democratic institutions and leaves all of South Africa's people with more political and economic freedom than they have now. </TEXT></DOC>
