<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-1338 </DOCNO><TEXT>A heat transfer drying apparatus includes an acoustically augmented heattransfer chamber for receiving material to be dried. The chamber includesa first heat transfer gas inlet, a second heat transfer gas inlet, amaterial inlet, and a gas outlet which also serves as a dried materialand gas outlet. A non-pulsing first heat transfer gas source providesa first drying gas to the acoustically augmented heat transfer chamberthrough the first heat transfer gas inlet. A valveless, continuous secondheat transfer gas source provides a second drying gas to the acousticallyaugmented heat transfer chamber through the second heat transfer gasinlet. The second drying gas also generates acoustic waves which bringabout acoustical coupling with the gases in the acoustically augmentedheat transfer chamber. The second drying gas itself oscillates at anacoustic frequency of approximately 180 Hz due to fluid mechanical motionin the gas. The oscillations of the second heat transfer gas coupledto the first heat transfer gas in the acoustically augmented heat transferchamber enhance heat and mass transfer by convection within the chamber.3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
