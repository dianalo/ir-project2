Don Edwards,D-Calif., and Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a letter to AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh.   ``Congress has not adopted a criminal statute for leaks, andcertainly never intended the theft of property law to be used inthis way,'' they wrote.   Edwards is chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civiland constitutional rights and Schumer chairs the subcommittee oncriminal justice.   Thornburgh on Sunday said subpoenaing reporters' telephonerecords was constitutional. He had said on Aug. 3 he wouldn'tprosecute reporters who obtain news leaks about criminalinvestigations but could charge federal officials who are theirsources with stealing government property.   ``The statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved inmisusing sensitive information that comes to them in an officialcapacity,'' said Thornburgh.   The department's reversal of an 11-year-old policy that wasintended to protect whistleblowers and reporters from prosecutionwas announced the previous day in testimony submitted to Congress.   The congressmen said they were ``deeply disturbed by thedepartment's decision to seek criminal sanctions against governmentemployees who leak information,'' and were ``opposed to forcingreporters to disclose their sources, through compulsory process orsubpoenas for reporters' telephone records.''   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday thatthe department had considered subpoenaing the telephone records ofCBS-TV reporter Rita Braver, who reported earlier this year that anFBI investigation involved Rep. William Gray, D-Pa.   Stories about Gray abounded during the House Democraticleadership election and the Justice Department took the unusual stepof announcing he was not the subject of an investigation. Gray waselected House Democratic Whip.   FBI agents interviewed department officials about the leak and atleast one official testified before a grand jury.   CBS learned several weeks ago about the plan to subpoena Braver'sphone records before it happened, and confronted the department,said the source.   Tom Goodman, a spokesman for the network in New York, said therecords had not been subpoenaed.   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian declined to comment onthe issue.</TEXT></DOC>
