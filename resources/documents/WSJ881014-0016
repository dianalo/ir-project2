A 10.4% gain in imports overshadowed a 3.9% export advance, contributing to a seasonally adjusted U.S. trade deficit of $12.18 billion in August, wider than a revised $9.47 billion in July. The deficit in July was originally estimated to be $9.53 billion.    The August shortfall exceeded economists' estimates about $1 billion but matched foreign exchange market participants' projections of a wider gap that had been circulating since last week.    Late in New York yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8155 marks, down from 1.8353 marks late Wednesday in New York, and at 127.43 yen, off from 129.06 yen late Wednesday. A good portion of the dollar's losses came prior to the release of the trade figures as the U.S. currency dropped below 128 yen and 1.8300 marks during early Tokyo trading. Dealers in Japan said the dollar might have fallen further were it not for comments from Japanese finance officials, who indicated their displeasure with a yen that advanced too swiftly.    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters, &quot;I have an impression that {the speed of the yen's appreciation this week} may be a little too fast.&quot; And Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank would &quot;act appropriately and flexibly&quot; if needed to smooth currency and price movements.    In Tokyo on Friday, the U.S. unit opened at 127.66 yen, down slightly from 127.98 Thursday.    Notwithstanding the dumping of the dollar in New York, dealers said they were impressed with the U.S. currency's basic resiliency in the face of widespread negative sentiment. &quot;It wasn't a freefall,&quot; said Victor Polce, a trader with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. in New York. He said that while the deficit was bad, &quot;The market had been expecting it for so long that the report was almost taken in stride.&quot;    Traders said the dollar slipped through key technical suppport at 1.8180 marks and 127 yen after the trade figures were released, then weakened to lows of 1.8105 marks and 126.60 yen. However, it bounced back during midday New York trading on rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve was intervening to shore up the U.S. currency, they said. No dealers confirmed the interventions, however.    Profit-taking also played a part in the recovery.    The dollar waned again in very choppy late trading that included a brief half-pfennig slide on a report quoting C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics and a former U.S. Treasury official.    Mr. Bergsten said it is a &quot;brutal reality&quot; that the U.S. dollar will have to decline to a rate of about 100 yen over time to bring about a necessary correction of the huge U.S. international trade deficits.    Dealers and analysts think the dollar is headed for more losses soon, but in the meantime they think the market will experience increased volatility that should trigger some large swings in exchange rates.    &quot;After a not-so-successful year, traders are ready to make some profits and kick things around a bit,&quot; said Michael McGuinness, an investment officer in foreign exchange at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank in Chicago. He said while there is a &quot;bearish edge&quot; to the dollar, &quot;I think dealers want to be daring and try to create some spreads.&quot;    At the same time, he added, &quot;the central banks will be trying to avoid a dollar collapse. Even if the lower dollar helps the trade imbalance, no one wants the dollar to get smashed and panic the financial markets.&quot;    William Harrington, the senior foreign exchange analyst with the WEFA Group in Pennsylvania, said the dollar's decline in the past week reflects the yen's new predominance as a leader in the currency markets. To a large extent, he said, the attitudes of Japanese financial officials will determine the fate of the U.S. currency.    &quot;The yen is leading the way again, as opposed to during the summer, when the BOJ (Bank of Japan) hung back and gave the market permission to raise the dollar above 130 yen.&quot; Now, said Mr. Harrington, Mr. Sumita and others have given their tacit approval to the yen's rise, even if these officials express some concern over the pace of the Japanese currency's advance.    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fell $1.50 to $406.90 an ounce, in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.6 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Friday, gold was quoted at $407.20 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
