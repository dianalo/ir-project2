About 80 percent of oilproduction and almost all of natural gas production are exported, because69 percent of energy is supplied by water-power generation. They have23 projects of prospecting and development since 1966, and productionof oil and gas has been operating in 17 fields, supplying over 1 millionbarrels per day in total of crude oil. Oil and gas fields are situatedunder the sea off Norway to the south of N62{sup 0}. The proved reserveis estimated to be 49.8 hundred million tons (in petroleum) in 1987.In the areas to the north of N62{sup 0}, the reserve of gas is inferredto predominate. Due to the effect of a fall in the price of oil since1986, the ordinary revenue does not cover expenditure and the prospectingactivity has been retarded. (3 figs, 16 tabs, 6 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
