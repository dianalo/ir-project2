In truth, however, some states are far more aggressive than others in going after tax revenue.    &quot;Tax effort&quot; measures how a state exploits its tax base relative to other states. &quot;It's what you do with what you have,&quot; explains a state-tax expert.    Connecticut, for example, has the highest per capita income in the U.S., but it doesn't have a personal income tax. New Yorkers also have high income levels, on average, but the state tries to recapture a big chunk of those funds with a stiff income tax. Thus, New York has a higher tax effort than Connecticut when it comes to taxing personal income.    The Washington-based Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations has ranked the states in terms of overall tax effort, using 1985 data. It looked at major revenue sources -- sales taxes, property taxes, license fees, user charges, mineral revenues, and personal and business income taxes -- in calculating the size of the burden each state imposes on its tax base.    The top 10 in tax effort: New York, District of Columbia, Alaska, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Iowa, Utah and Wyoming. New York's tax effort was 56% greater than the U.S. average.    Nevada and New Hampshire had the lowest tax-effort scores, 64% below the national norm. Other states with comparatively low tax efforts: Florida, Texas, Delaware, Tennessee, Missouri, Oklahoma and Colorado.    Study Disputes Union   On Mexican Border Jobs   ORGANIZED LABOR has long complained about the bustling manufacturing belt that's sprung up in Northern Mexico. Union officials argue that U.S. companies have exported thousands of jobs to factories in the Mexican border cities, taking advantage of that country's 90-cent-an-hour minimum wage.    Helping to spur this job migration across the Rio Grande has been a provision in the U.S. tariff code that allows duty-free movement of U.S. products and components into Mexico, as long as those items are integrated into products re-imported to the U.S.    Labor has been urging Congress to repeal the tariff provisions as a means of saving jobs in the U.S. Now comes an exhaustive report by the International Trade Commission that says scrapping the tariff breaks would cause scarcely a blip in the U.S. employment picture.    It's the huge differential between Mexican and U.S. wages resulting from successive peso devaluations, not favorable tariff consideration, that's currently driving the U.S.-Mexican border economy, the ITC says. The commission couldn't find a single U.S. company doing business on the border that said it would return to the U.S. if the tariff provisions were repealed.    Repeal of the tariff provisions would likely cost jobs in U.S. factories that have opened to supply components to the Mexican assembly plants, but the overall employment effect in the U.S. &quot;would be small,&quot; the ITC says. The bulk of these new supplier companies are in Texas.    Any movement to repeal the provisions would require action by a trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee. Says a subcommittee staff member, after reviewing the ITC's findings: &quot;The people who were scared to death about losing their program don't have anything to fear.&quot;    Retirees Shun Sun Belt   And Most Other Moves   PICTURES of retirees basking in Sun Belt retirement havens are everywhere in the winter months. So it's easy to assume that older Americans are migrating en masse to warmer climes. Wrong.    People aged 65 years and older actually show a marked tendency to stay put. Census Bureau figures show that fewer than 5% of this age group change their geographic location.    The result is that the Midwest, the Great Lakes region, and parts of the Northeast are actually getting &quot;grayer&quot; than most of the Sun Belt. Younger people are moving out of these states, seeking better opportunities, and older people are staying on. In 1986, 19 states had at least 12.5% of their population aged 65 or older. Only one, Florida, is a bona fide Sun Belt representative.    Florida is a stark exception to the graying of the Frost Belt. With a median age of 36, it has the oldest population of any state. In fact, for a glimpse of the U.S. population in roughly 30 years, look at Florida right now. Its share of elderly (18% of the population is 65 years plus) is roughly what the U.S. population will look like in the year 2020.    Six States Gain Bulk   Of Legal Immigrants   WHILE ILLEGAL aliens make the headlines, an unheralded but steady stream of lawful immigrants continues to pour into the U.S. In 1986, nearly 602,000 foreigners were granted legal immigrant status. That's the highest figure in more than 50 years and a total slightly less than the population of Washington, D.C.    Where did these people go? The Immigration and Naturalization Service says that nearly three-quarters of the new arrivals headed for six states: California, New York, Florida, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois.    As for where they came from, the just-released INS 1986 Statistical Yearbook has an intriguing breakdown. California took in 13,600 Vietnamese immigrants. Nearly 22,000 Cubans landed in Florida, as did 121 Romanians. Mississippi admitted 69 Filipinos and one Peruvian. And 68 Poles found a home in Idaho. </TEXT></DOC>
