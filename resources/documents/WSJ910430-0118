Top officials of CBS and Turner will meet in the next fewweeks to discuss a partnership between CBS News and Turner'sCable News Network. The two organizations may agree to sharenews footage and facilities in foreign and domestic bureaus,and CBS News may end up having CNN cover lesser news events,such as a political rally or a routine presidentialannouncement, people familiar with the plans said.</LP><TEXT>   Spokeswomen for CBS and Turner confirmed the discussions,which were first reported yesterday in Electronic Media, atrade publication. Ed Turner, executive vice president ofCNN, said the revived talks were initiated by CBS ChairmanLaurence A. Tisch. &quot;We'll listen and hear what CBS has tooffer,&quot; Mr. Turner said. &quot;CNN isn't going in there with awish list.&quot;   A shared news gathering arrangement would be the mostdrastic step yet by a network news division to pare the highcosts of coverage. The news operations of all three majorbroadcast networks are examining ways of reducing costs. Theyeach spent upward of $40 million to cover the war, at a timewhen many viewers were tuned to CNN and advertisers werewithdrawing commercials rather than let them run duringspecial war coverage.   The cost pressures have been toughest, however, at CBS.The broadcasting company, hurt by an industrywide advertisingslump and by large losses on its sports programming, islaying off 6% of its work force, or about 400 employees, in1991. CBS News is taking the largest cut, laying off about100 of its 1,065 employees and reducing staff in various newsbureaus, including the one in Atlanta, where CNN is based.   But CBS and Turner Broadcasting haven't made progress inprevious efforts to link up; discussions in February 1990ended after the two sides couldn't come to terms. And theprospect of joining forces with Turner concerns some insidersat CBS News, who fear that the organization would becomemerely a packager of the news.   A partnership with CNN, however, would enable CBS News todevote its limited resources to the production of profitableprime-time programs, including &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;48 Hours.&quot;   Once fierce competitors, the three networks and CNNalready cooperate to a limited degree on some stories. InApril 1990, for example, CBS News, CNN and ABC News, a unitof Capital Cities/ABC Inc., combined equipment and crews tocover the release of a U.S. hostage in the Middle East, eachsaving about $12,000 by pooling the coverage.</TEXT></DOC>
