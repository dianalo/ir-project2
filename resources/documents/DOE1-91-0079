There are 50,201 men in the study for a total of 754,391person-years and 6,757 deaths were observed in this population over theperiod of the study. The most serious hazard in this population was deathdue to violent causes. The population was subdivided into gold miners,nickel-copper miners, iron ore miners, other ore miners, mixed ore miners,and uranium miners. Only in certain types of miners was an increase indeaths from non-neoplastic lung disease detectable. A significant increasewas noted in underground gold miners, mixed ore miners and in uraniumminers. This increase was largely due to increased death rates from silicosisand chronic interstitial pneumonia. In addition there were 43 deathsdue to silicotuberculosis in gold miners and 36 deaths due to the samecause in mixed ore miners. It is estimated that the total differencebetween observed and expected deaths from silicosis and chronic interstitialpneumonia as well as from silicotuberculosis which was observed goldminers and in mixed ore miners can actually be attributed to gold miningonly. Increased cancer risk in non-uranium miners is observed for cancerof the trachea, bronchus and lung in full-time underground gold minersand full-time underground mixed ore miners, and cancer of the stomachin full-time underground gold miners. It is assumed that the increasedrisk of lung cancer in both these groups of miners is in fact due tounderground gold mining only. As to uranium miners, previous studieshave already demonstrated an increased lung cancer risk in these menand this finding was confirmed in this study. Men who have also workedfor Eldorado Nuclear Limited show a siginificantly increased risk ofdeath from all causes and from all disease causes.</TEXT></DOC>
