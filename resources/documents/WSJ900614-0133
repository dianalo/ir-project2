Themoney was invested in dummy companies in Hong Kong.</LP><TEXT>   Libya maintains that the plant produces medicine. But theprosecutor's 100-page indictment accuses the 49-year-olddefendant of helping to build a chemical-weapons plant inRabta. &quot;He didn't confirm this, but he also didn't deny it,&quot;Mr. Wechsung said. Prosecutors hope to receive confirmationof the plant's purpose later in the trial.   Mr. Hippenstiel referred to the Rabta facility as a&quot;chemical plant.&quot; Mr. Wechsung said Mr. Hippenstiel explainedhe was withholding further details for reasons of personalsafety.   Mr. Hippenstiel's admission added a new chapter to thealleged violation of West Germany's export controls byexporters of technology useful in weapons production.Embarrassed by the Imhausen scandal and pressured by the U.S.to crack down on arms exporters, the Bonn government spent ayear crafting tougher export measures, which are expected tobe passed into law within a few weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
