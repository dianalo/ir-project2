Ross Johnson Buys, Sells And Then Reverses Field; Now He Would Go Private --- The Biggest Transaction Ever </HL><AUTHOR> John Helyar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> RJR </CO><IN> TNM TOB FOD PRO BIO </IN><TEXT>   Maybe it should come as no surprise that F. Ross Johnson has moved to take RJR Nabisco private, in what would be the biggest corporate transaction ever. In his two years at the helm of the venerable food and tobacco giant, he has engineered one abrupt corporate turnabout after another.    The $17.6 billion buy-out proposed yesterday is the latest lightning-fast course shift the unpredictable Mr. Johnson has made, reversing a plan for steady internal growth of a public company through capital investment. It also is the consummate expression of the trait that has propelled Mr. Johnson to the front rank of American business: a genius for solving his companies' problems by selling out.    The master plan for the latest deal apparently calls for the private company to retain the core cigarette business and probably shed most of its Nabisco food business -- acquired just three years ago by what was then R.J. Reynolds Industries. That would bring RJR right back to what it was before it started diversifying in the 1970s: a simple tobacco company. But it is one with big problems, not only because of the siege of anti-smoking groups but because of its own missteps.    The move also goes against an industry tide: the trend for big tobacco and other consumer-products concerns to gobble up food makers. There is Philip Morris bidding for Kraft, Grand Metropolitan going after Pillsbury, Tyson Foods driving for Holly Farms. But this trend means food companies are a hot market -- one that Mr. Johnson can sell into. Timing is also a trait the RJR chief is known for.    He is striking now at a time when financing for big deals is readily available and the stock price is down. As recently as August, RJR's stock was trading lower than its $49 level when Mr. Johnson took over in January 1987. The offer for a leveraged buy-out probably will be at about $75 a share, and now other tobacco stocks are soaring too.    One motive for the buy-out plan seems obvious. As an owner instead of a mere proprietor, Mr. Johnson, along with vice chairman Edward A. Horrigan Jr. and whoever else may be involved, could personally reap the rewards from spinning off brand-rich businesses like Nabisco and Del Monte. He would profit, too, if his initiative merely put the company &quot;in play,&quot; attracting another bidder hungry for assets like these. Nabisco controls a huge 45% of the $5 billion cookie and cracker market, with famous brands like Ritz and Oreo.    The tobacco business RJR would be left with, for all its image problems, is a lushly profitable one, now accounting for two-thirds of earnings. Its brands are equally well-established: Camel, Winston, Salem.    Throughout his career, Mr. Johnson has been more an opportunistic deal-maker than an operational manager. He rose to the top of Standard Brands and sold it to Nabisco, then rose to the top of Nabisco and sold it to R.J. Reynolds. Now he is at the top of RJR Nabisco, a company that is almost too big to sell; the alternative is to take it private.    Heading a private rather than public company would suit Mr. Johnson well. An impatient man, he would be spared a years-long wait for a payoff from his planned $2.8 billion cookie-plant modernization and $1 billion investment in a &quot;smokeless cigarette,&quot; a product that in any case is beginning to look embattled.    Going private would free him to exercise his unnerving management style unfettered. It is a style that includes selling off businesses with blinding speed, slashing staffs and operating heedless of corporate traditions -- as when, three weeks after taking over at RJR, he announced it would leave its 112-year home of Winston-Salem, N.C., for Atlanta.    His style is also one of sending out executives like firemen to handle short-term assignments, and compensating his best people aggressively. Last year the top 30 executives at RJR earned an average of $414,000 in salaries and bonuses, and even lowly middle managers get luxury company cars and company-paid country-club memberships. Mr. Johnson says the siege condition of a tobacco company and the results he demands dictate such a policy. &quot;I'd rather pay twice as much and have half as many people,&quot; he said recently. (He wasn't available for an interview yesterday.)    Going private also would free him from the need to keep a board of directors happy. At RJR Nabisco, this seems to have been a major project. Mr. Johnson raised directors' pay to $50,000 a year, among the highest in the nation. Four of the outside directors also get hefty consulting contracts, ranging from $78,000 to $250,000 a year. And through contributions he has seen to it that some other board members are honored in academia.    Above all, Mr. Johnson as a private-company manager would have the freedom to exercise his habit of turning on a dime. A gregarious former basketball player (at the University of Manitoba) who is drawn to famous sports figures, the 57-year-old executive portrays a seeming chaos in the corporate suite as a virtue, saying it promotes a culture of fast response and flexibility.    Still, what ensued when Mr. Johnson took over as president of RJR Nabisco 22 months ago sometimes looked like the product of a short attention span. In his first week as chief executive, RJR agreed to buy Almaden Vineyards for its Heublein spirits subsidiary; in his third week, RJR agreed to sell Heublein.    When Mr. Johnson decided to move corporate headquarters to Atlanta -- also immediately after taking over -- RJR donated its old headquarters building to Wake Forest University. Six months later, when RJR decided to move its Planters andamp; Life Savers division from New Jersey to Winston-Salem, it had to rent back the old headquarters from Wake Forest.    Or consider this reorganization saga: First RJR Nabisco combined Nabisco with Del Monte (which it has had since 1979). Then it broke off Del Monte's fresh-fruit business into a separate subsidiary. This was soon reintegrated with Nabisco. Then the company combined fresh fruit with Del Monte USA into a new separate subsidiary. That, too, was soon reintegrated into Nabisco. Then the company split it off all over again this past May.    Mr. Johnson cheerfully admits this works out to a reorganization about every half-year. &quot;We had to take it apart to figure out what we had,&quot; he said recently. And he can point to results: Overall, RJR Nabisco's per-share profit has grown at a robust 24% annual clip in the first two years of the Johnson regime.    But this sort of thing takes a toll. Fernando Germucio, the well-regarded president of Del Monte's American business, became fed up with it all, according to associates, and took early retirement at the end of 1987. Peter Rogers, No. 2 man at Nabisco, is leaving a few months after being reassigned in that subsidiary's latest reorganization. A group of major banana suppliers to Del Monte left in May, upset at all the reorganizing. The suppliers, who accounted for about one-third of Del Monte's production from Guatemala, joined a newly formed company -- headed by the former head of Del Monte fresh fruit, Sam Gordon.    Mr. Johnson, however, has also made some changes at RJR that even some of its victims agree were needed, like trimming a fat headquarters staff. &quot;I would have gotten rid of me, too,&quot; says a former RJR planner. &quot;You don't need 1,000 people whispering in the CEO's ear.&quot; Now, however, this man wonders whether too much planning has been replaced with too little.    Though Mr. Johnson is expected to hang onto tobacco after a buy-out and shed food operations, it was food companies -- Standard Brands and then Nabisco -- through which he came to RJR. Eighteen months after R.J. Reynolds took over a Johnson-led Nabisco, Mr. Johnson became chief executive of the merged company.    RJR Nabisco executives under Mr. Johnson have been similarly peripatetic. The corporate ethos is that an employee doesn't have a job but an assignment. Headquarters is in a suburban mall-office complex overlooking an interstate highway exchange. The tone is transitory. A retired chairman shakes his head over the situation. &quot;I see this company marching to a different drummer now, and one that I don't understand,&quot; says J. Paul Sticht.    Ironic words, for Mr. Sticht was the man who took the helm of a provincial Reynolds tobacco company 15 years ago and set about making it a thoroughly modern enterprise: acquiring other businesses, bringing in professional managers and setting in motion events that introduced bloody corporate politics to a once-genteel company. It is the sort of passage made by many American companies in that time, with the rise of merger mania, rampant restructuring and corporate sharks. But RJR Nabisco isn't just any company. It is the 19th-largest concern on the Fortune 500 list. Its very size magnifies the problems and consequences of this passage, and its most important business, tobacco, has been under siege.    Ironic, too, that RJR Nabisco's strengths today have far less to do with the maneuvers of its current executives than with the sagacity of earlier ones, who built the eminent brands it owns. Today's RJR is blessed by the inherited advantage of huge market shares and the inherently profitable nature of cigarette-making. It is adept at throwing its weight around, whether firing Saatchi andamp; Saatchi for its anti-smoking commercials (as it did earlier this year) or using its huge sales force to muscle out extra shelf space in supermarkets.    But its core businesses are mature at best, and in permanent decline at worst. Mr. Johnson has sold off a number of businesses that did have growth prospects, including Canada Dry and Del Monte's frozen foods. For growth, he was saying as recently as two months ago, he would turn to quality and manufacturing efficiency, building a state-of-the-art, multibillion-dollar baking facility. &quot;We're at the stage where if we're going to grow, it has to be internally, like Ford did with the Taurus and the Sable or like Chrysler came back with the K-car,&quot; Mr. Johnson said then.    All such plans regarding food are probably on hold now, but not the heavy spending to market a smokeless cigarette, Premier. RJR bills this as a revolutionary breakthrough. Yet the move can equally well be seen as symbolic of RJR's failure to nurture its cigarettes with smoke.    R.J. Reynolds had been the first company to come up with a mass-marketed cigarette brand, Camel. It was the first U.S. company to develop a filter cigarette and a menthol cigarette -- Winston and Salem, respectively, in honor of its home city. For years, Winston was the best-selling cigarette in the country, and the Reynolds stable of brands held a commanding market-share lead on archrival Philip Morris.    But while the company was out on acquisition adventures in the 1970s and early 1980s, Philip Morris was gaining ground, preparing to teach Reynolds a tough business lesson. In 1973, Mr. Sticht began the process of buying other kinds of businesses and bringing in executives from other sorts of consumer-products companies. The former diverted money from cigarettes when Reynolds needed to build new plants. The latter found that what worked for marketing toothpaste didn't necessarily work for tobacco. Reynolds began floundering around, looking to rediscover the formula by changing ad agencies, ad campaigns and marketing managers.    Meanwhile, Philip Morris was growing Marlboro into a monster brand and investing in new plants. Marlboro, with the same cowboy theme and the same ad agency for 30 years, passed Winston as top brand. And in 1983 R.J. Reynolds lost its title of No. 1 cigarette marketer to Philip Morris.    Now, if the leveraged buy-out goes through, the cigarette business will get a chance to grow again in a new environment -- free of oversight by shareholders, securities analysts, directors and to a certain extent public critics. It's the kind of situation well suited to a manager given to bold and sometimes baffling strokes.    But one financial analyst, Roy D. Burry of Kidder Peabody, sees the proposed buy-out in a much narrower light. &quot;I think it's an effort to take the company private on the cheap,&quot; Mr. Burry says. &quot;I think Ross Johnson is trying to get rich.&quot;    ---                      RJR Chronology   1875 -- Company is founded by Richard Joshua Reynolds in Winston, N.C., a town later merged with nearby Salem.   1913 -- Introduces Camel, the first mass-produced cigarette.   1954 -- Introduces Winston, the first filter-tip cigarette.   1963 -- Makes its first diversification move with the acquisition of Hawaiian Punch.   1969 -- Acquires Sea-Land Services Inc., originator of containerized freight shipping.   1979 -- Acquires Del Monte Corp.   1984 -- Sells Sea-Land.   1985 -- Acquires Nabisco Brands Inc.   1986 -- Sells Canada Dry and Kentucky Fried Chicken units.   1987 -- F.
