Police reported at 5 p.m. they arrested 99people, but clashes kept up and reporters saw additional arrests.No injuries were reported immediately.   Columns of marchers, carrying banners and posters of oppositionpolitical groups, converged at Plaza Italia, near the city center,but police kept most of them from proceeding downtown on thecentral boulevard, the Alameda.   Some protesters succeeded in entering the city center and foughtrunning skirmishes with helmeted riot police, who fired tear gasgrenades and used water cannon mounted on armored trucks to breakup the groups.   On Oct. 5, 1988, voters rejected a proposal that Pinochet, whoseized power in a 1973 coup, remain president until 1997.
