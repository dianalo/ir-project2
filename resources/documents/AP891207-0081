The rebels claimed they shot down a military helicopter, but thegovernment said it suffered a mechanical problem and crashed.   A statement by the armed forces press office said columns ofrebels infiltrated the metropolitan area from the north, east andwest during the night, including the upper-class Escalon and SanBenito districts.   There were no immediate reports of casualties, a militaryspokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity for securityreasons.   Planes and helicopter gunships flew over the city during thenight, dropping flares and strafing suspected rebel positions,while troops on the ground opened up with automatic weapons fire.   But the new outbreak was much smaller than the fighting thatbegan when guerrillas launched an urban offensive on Nov. 11 aspart of their decade-old struggle for power against a succession ofU.S.-backed governments.   Fighting had subsided to a few scarce shots since Friday afterthe rebels withdrew from an incursion in Escalon and San Benito.   Also reported under attack were the working-class neighborhoodsof Aytuxtepeque, San Ramon and Soyapango, north and east of thecity, and the small town of Apopa, to the north, the military said.   The military spokesman said a U.S.-made helicopter crashedduring the night because ``of mechanical failure,'' but the rebels'clandestine Radio Venceremos claimed it was shot down by guerrillafire.   In the broadcast, the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front also announced they were renewing their sabotagecampaign against electric power installations and other economictargets.   Rebel groups destroyed two city buses, and five privateautomobiles were destroyed by guerrillas in Santa Ana, 25 mileswest of the capital, and a burlap bag factory in San Miguel, 85miles east of San Salvador.   The rebels also were reported to have dynamited a bridge on theLitoral Highway near the city of Usulutan, 70 miles east of thecapital.   In an unrelated development, the government allowed three U.S.Episcopalian bishops to enter the country to check on severalEpiscopalians who were imprisoned during the recent offensive byleftist guerrillas.   Bishops William Frey of the diocese of Colorado, David Reed ofKentucky, and William Swing of California arrived Wednesday on acommercial flight from Miami and went through immigrationproceedings with no problems.   The first two had come on Tuesday and were told by immigrationauthorities their visas were invalid. They were put on a flightback to Miami, where they spent the night before making the secondattempt to enter.   Frey said President Alfredo Cristiani sent a letter by telefaxapologizing for the previous day's problems.</TEXT></DOC>
