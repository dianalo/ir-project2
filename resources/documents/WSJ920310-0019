So far, they are still waiting. Investment groups arebuying at a much slower pace, if at all, with the more than$3 billion they earmarked in 1991 to buy cable systems. Thethreat of new regulation has damped some of the enthusiasmfor cable acquisitions. And while cable's reliance onsubscriber fees has enabled it to weather the recessionbetter than other media businesses that depend onadvertising, at least one investor group says a harder lookat cable's growth projections suggests they may be overlyoptimistic.</LP><TEXT>   In some ways, the cable market is like real estate: Buyersare looking for bargains and sellers are holding out for thevalues put on their properties in the 1980s, when cablesystems traded at prices equivalent to 15 times their cashflow, or, by another measure, more than $2,500 a subscriber.&quot;There are a bunch of potential sellers out there who arewaiting for prices to get back to the levels of the late'80s,&quot; says Alan Gerry, chairman of Cablevision IndustriesCorp.   Cablevision, Liberty, N.Y., teamed up with the buy-outfirm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. last year for cableinvestments, planning to spend from $800 million to $1billion through a combination of equity and borrowing. Ineight months, Mr. Gerry has bought one 68,000-subscribersystem, in California, for $132.5 million, or about 10 timescash flow. &quot;We're still looking to buy,&quot; says Mr. Gerry, &quot;butonly if we can pay a fair price.&quot;   Others who pledged to spend big sums have been even lessactive. In late 1989, Narragansett Capital Inc. inProvidence, R.I., and Lazard Freres andamp; Co. pledged to raise$300 million to spend on media properties including cable;they recently concluded their fund-raising efforts at about$170 million and haven't yet bought any properties.Executives at both American Express Co.'s Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc. unit and investment concern Blackstone Groupsaid last year that they had earmarked substantial funds frommoney management partnerships for cable purchases. AmericanExpress has made no investments, and a senior official atBlackstone, which has several hundred million dollars undermanagement, says the company has revised its plans.   While Blackstone officials say they view cable as a soundbusiness, they say they have re-evaluated its prospects. &quot;Ifyou believe the catechism of the cable industry, consumersare just going to keep spending more money for moreprogramming and more channels, and cash flow is just going tokeep growing,&quot; said one Blackstone official, who asked not tobe identified. &quot;But for the amount of money we have undermanagement, we don't think cable offers a high enough rate ofreturn&quot; for investors, unless asking prices for systems comedown substantially, he adds.   The cable industry now reaches 55.8 million, or 61%, ofthe nation's 92 million TV households, so the days of headysubscriber growth are indeed past. Industry boosters maintainthat cable will continue to grow cash flow at least 9% to 12%annually with new revenue streams from pay-per-view and avast expansion in channel capacity. But skeptics contend thatconsumer demand isn't infinite and there won't be enoughadvertising dollars to split among new channels.   Cable operators jacked up their rates after de-regulationby the Cable Act of 1984; with the lure of burgeoning cashflow, buyers piled on massive debt to pay for systems. But bythe late 1980s, the pace of sales slackened as bank financingdried up. And spiraling cable subscriber fees attracted theire of consumers and legislators, who began a drive tore-regulate the industry.   The threat of re-regulation persistsone measure toregulate prices and encourage competition from alternativevideo delivery systems has already passed the Senate and asimilar measure will be debated in the House. Some analystsbelieve prospects are now stronger than ever that some kindof regulation will be imposed on cable rates -- and that hassome potential cable system buyers worrying about profitmargins.   The volume of cable system sales did pick up last yearfrom an eight-year low in 1990. There were numerous smalltransactions as cable companies sought to buy propertiescontiguous to their existing systems. Big deals were farfewer. Hallmark Cards Inc., Kansas City, Mo., and cableindustry veteran James Hoak formed Crown Media Inc. in March1991 and announced it would acquire a majority stake inCencom Cable Associates Inc. in St. Louis, a system with550,000 customers, in a transaction valued at about $536million.   But other systems are still waiting for buyers. Thoughinterest rates have come down and strict federal guidelinesthat restricted borrowing for highly leveraged media dealsare being eased, credit is still tight and banks are askingbuyers to put up more equity than in the past. Andprospective buyers are more carefully scrutinizingproperties.   Last September, Sutton Capital Associates, New York, put&quot;for sale&quot; signs on three systems in New Jersey andMassachusetts with a total of 161,500 subscribers. Investmentbanker Goldman Sachs expected to sell the properties by yearend, and though it is said to have found a buyer, has notclosed a deal yet. &quot;It's taking longer to kick the tires,&quot;says Robert Smith, a spokesman for Sutton.   Buyers are also discovering it is hard to find systems inattractive, fast-growing, suburban areas. And many cablesystems were built more than a decade ago and will requireexpensive upgrades before they can offer new channels andservices. &quot;There's an excess of cash to buy and a shortage ofquality properties to sell,&quot; says Brian Deevy, president ofcable broker Daniels andamp; Associates. The funds raised last yearare &quot;not all going to get spent,&quot; he adds.   As for large cable companies who might be buyers of othercable systems, many are now paying down debt they piled on inthe 1980s and focusing their resources on new technologiessuch as fiber optics to improve service. The heavy scrutinyof cable in Washington has focused attention on the power ofsome of the biggest companies. And debt-laden industryleaders like Tele-Communications Inc., Denver, and TimeWarner Inc., New York, have not been in the market in anysignificant way to buy new cable systems.   For owners of cable systems, meanwhile, many would ratherhang on to properties with strong cash flow than sell themfor cut-rate prices. &quot;Put simply,&quot; says Steve Rattner, apartner at investment banker Lazard, &quot;no one has to sell.&quot;Viacom Inc., New York, is still shopping a system in Dayton,Ohio, and a system in Milwaukee, both of which have been onthe market for nearly two years. But the company won't sellunless it gets its price. Says Viacom Chief Executive FrankBiondi, &quot;People aren't going to leap to do a deal unless theyhave to.&quot;   Despite the current doldrums, many in the industrymaintain that the pace of transactions will pick up andcontend that a number of deals are quietly in the works now.&quot;We're looking at a lot more deals coming down the pipe thisyear,&quot; says John Waller, chairman of cable broker WallerCapital Corp. &quot;There will be more buyers, especially as moredeals are announced.&quot; Adds Julian Brodsky, vice chairman ofComcast Corp., a large cable operator in Philadelphia, &quot;Therewill be more deals in 1992, if for no other reason than arelease for the pent-up pressure.&quot;   ---             The Cable Industry by the Numbers                                                                                                          Five new equity partnerships formed last year to buy cablesystems have spent about a third of a nearly $3 billionwarchest.
