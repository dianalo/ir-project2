Case to Rule on Right to Jury Trial</HEAD><HEAD>Eds: Corrects spelling of breaching in 2nd graf</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to decidewhether union members who sue their union for allegedly denying fairrepresentation are entitled to a jury trial if they also seekmonetary compensation, such as back pay.   Lawsuits accusing unions of breaching their duty of fairrepresentation generally are tried before judges without juries.   But ruling in a case from North Carolina last year, the 4th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals said a jury trial can be demanded whenmonetary compensation is part of the relief sought.   Other appeals courts have ruled differently.   The 4th Circuit court's ruling was a victory for 27 truck driverswho sued Local 391 of the Teamsters union in 1983.   The suit stemmed from the drivers' transfers from variouslocations to the McLean Trucking Co.'s terminal in Winston-Salem,N.C.   After the transfers, the 27 were laid off and recalled on severaloccasions.   The drivers contend that McLean breached a collective-bargainingagreement by manipulating recall procedures so it could give otherdrivers preference over them, and that Local 391 failed to fairlyrepresent them in the resulting grievances.   The suit sought, among other things, compensatory damages forlost wages and benefits.   The case is Local 391 vs. Terry, 88-1719.</TEXT></DOC>
