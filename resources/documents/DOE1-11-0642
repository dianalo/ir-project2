The contrast material was injected into a vein in 21 patientsand into an artery in the other 4. Amipaque (2 mg/kg) followed by 4 mlof saline was injected intravenously. We recorded the digital subtractionangiography images on videotape and analyzed them with a Nexus ImageProcessor and a Vax-11/750 computer. The region of interest (ROI) wasset at the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid and sinus confluence.Time-density curves were obtained for two ROIs, and cerebral circulationtime (CCT) was measured as the time from the carotid peak to the sinuspeak. Images of the diagnostic value were obtained in 16 patients inwhom the contrast material was injected into the carotid artery, superiorvena cava or peripheral vein at the elbow. The images obtained in patientsin whom the contrast material was injected into the peripheral vein onthe hand were of no value. No advers effects were seen when the totalinjection volume was limited to 4 ml/Kg. CCT was measured in 14 patients.In 9 patients, no cerebrovascular disease was disclosed, the mean CCTin this group was 4.3 +- 0.54 sec with a range of 3.73 to 5.06 sec. Theprolongation of CCT was found in patients with superior sagittal sinusthrombosis, moyamoya disease and frontal hematoma. The mean CCT in thisgroup was 6.1 +- 2.48 sec. DSA was useful for diagnosing cerebrovasculardiseases in neonates and children. In addition, measurement of CCT wasvery useful for quantitating the cerebral circulation in pediatric patients.</TEXT></DOC>
