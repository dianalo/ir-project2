(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan sees communism on therun, Jimmy Carter is concerned about another oil crisis, and GeraldFord worries about ``an economic time bomb'' exploding if thenation's deficit keeps expanding.   They, along with former President Nixon, are among 47 of thenation's top statesmen and scholars who peer into the 1990s in acautionary, mostly conservative guidebook to the future releasedfor review Monday.   ``We must not fall into the trap of thinking that a reduction inU.S.-Soviet tensions means the end of the conflict,'' Nixon warnsin ``Thinking About America _ The United States in the 1990s.''   Nixon has the first word and Reagan the last in this collectionof essays that also includes observations by Atlanta Mayor AndrewYoung, Secretary of State George Shultz, Soviet writer AlexanderSolzhenitsyn, Attorney General Edwin Meese and three NobelPrize-winning economists.   The 590-page book, which goes on sale in September, waspublished by the influential Hoover Institution on War, Revolutionand Peace.   A similar collection of essays by the think tank eight years agoserved as a blueprint for the Reagan administration, according toone reader who is quoted in the introduction to the current book _Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.   Despite a few pieces by liberals and moderates, most of thecontributors are conservatives.   Physicist and ``Star Wars'' defense advocate Edward Teller,former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger, and former nationalsecurity adviser Richard V. Allen write about the need for strongdefense. Special envoy Philip Habib discusses the world's troublespots.   Other essays focus on foreign policy, national security,international economic issues, domestic policy and national purposeand philosophical views on peace, prosperity and liberty.   Reagan claims he succeeded with ``three urgent foreign policytasks'' he faced in 1981: to restore the nation's economic strengthand reinvigorate the world economy; to rebuild U.S. militarystrength; and to restore America's self-confidence.   Reagan sees the world heading into the ``Information Age'' withgreat advances to come in computers and telecommunications thatwill play a large role in opening up communist countries.   He argues ``it is no coincidence that this new burst ofinnovation has originated in the free nations, where knowledge andinformation flow freely...''   The communist system faces a dilemma because of informationtechnology, he says. If it allows technology to develop foreconomic growth, it risks challenges to the party's monopoly ofpower. If it resists modernization for fear of losing politicalcontrol, it will fall farther behind.   ``Probably it has no choice,'' he says. ``These regimes willfind they cannot resist the forces of change and the power of thehuman spirit.''   Carter warns of threats to civil liberties when ``well-meaningpeople look for simple solutions to their problems.''   He hopes for improved relations with the Soviet Union but saysthe United States must be cautious in negotiations with Gorbachev.   The United States also must ``accommodate the burgeoninginfluence of such countries as China, Japan and Brazil,'' he says,``and deal with a more tightly aligned Europe that is alreadylooking eastward and becoming equivocal about its singularcommitments to the West.''   He said the United States could face another energy crisis inthe 1990s and must overcome ``a lackadaisical attitude (that) isnow causing a disturbing reversal of our nation's domesticproduction and importation of foreign oil.''   Ford says the nation's deepening debt poses a more seriousproblem.   ``Mark my words,'' he writes, ``unless we as a nation face up tothe facts of fiscal reality and responsibility, and the sacrificesrequired to restore it, the economic time bomb we are sitting onwill do us in as surely as any sudden enemy assault.''   Nixon proposes bolstering American conventional forces inEurope, Korea and the Persian Gulf and argues that the UnitedStates ``must take advantage of Moscow's flagging economic strengthto improve our own competive position around the world.''   He also advises Michael Dukakis and George Bush to campaign for``a new America,'' recalling that was suggested to him by France'sCharles de Gaulle in 1959.   ``As vice president, I could not take advantage of that advice,for it would appear I was repudiating President Eisenhower,'' Nixonrecalled. ``But John Kennedy did run on that theme, and he won.''</TEXT></DOC>
