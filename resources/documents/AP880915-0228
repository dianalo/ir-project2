(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The $1.3 billion plan to split PlaytexHoldings Inc. into two companies will enable each one to focus ontheir own areas of business, while giving a big return to investorswho bought Playtex in 1986, says Chairman Joel E. Smilow.   On Wednesday, the Stamford-based company said it would divideinto two separate companies under a series of buyout transactionsled by two groups each headed by Smilow.   The deal would separate Playtex' family products businesses fromits intimate apparel operations, allowing their respectivemanagements to operate more independently of each other.   The group led by Smilow, members of Playtex Holdings managementand Thomas H. Lee Co., a Boston-based investment firm, agreed topay $9.60 in cash and $1 in face value of a new issue of preferredstock for each of the company's 50 million outstanding,privately-held common shares, a total of about $530 million.   The Smilow-Lee group also will acquire or redeem PlaytexHoldings' outstanding debt and preferred stock worth $770 million.   A second group, led by Smilow and members of Playtex ApparelProducts Inc. management, then would acquire that business for $380million in cash.   Smilow said the deal does several things including give ``awonderful return'' to shareholders, who invested about $10 millionto acquire Playtex in 1986, and creating two separate companies,each focused on their own areas of business.   Playtex Holdings acquired the businesses of InternationalPlaytex Inc. from subsidiaries of BCI Holdings Inc. in a $1.25billion leveraged buy-out on Dec. 12, 1986, retaining Playtex'intimate apparel and family products businesses while selling itscosmetic and fragrance units for $350 million.   The company last year made an aborted attempt to sell its familyproducts division, which makes products such as Playtex tampons, toJohnson andamp; Johnson Inc. for $726 million.   Management owns 28 percent of Playtex Holdings stock, with therest held by institutional investors, BCI Holdings and theinvestment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   Playtex Holdings had 1987 sales of $614.4 million, including$310.4 million from the intimate apparel division. Overalloperating profit was $154.8 million, including $46.4 million fromintimate apparel.   Smilow, who also is Playtex' chief executive and president, saidthe sale of the apparel business would allow Playtex Holdings toconcentrate on its family products and hair care businesses. Italso would allow management of the separate businesses to operatemore independently of each other, while keeping current topmanagement, namely Smilow and vice chairman Hercules Sotos, incommand.   After the transactions, management will own 40 percent to 50percent of the family products group and 100 percent of the apparelbusiness, Smilow said.   The transactions are subject to the execution of definitiveagreements, finalizing financing arrangements and obtaining anynecessary approvals.   Thomas E.
