However, Botha said he was not embarrassed to have made thecharges, even if the messages were the work of ``a crackpot.''   Botha claimed he was simply trying to avert conflict prior tothe Nov. 7-11 elections that are to lead Namibia, a South Africancolony, into independence.   ``If these transmission are a hoax, I would be the first to beoverjoyed,'' Botha said in a statement today. ``At least it has hadthe result that everybody has been sensitized to the need tocurtail violence or intimidation.''   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, fought a23-year war in the territory against the guerrillas of theSouth-West Africa People's Organization. South Africa signed aregional peace accord last year under which it has agreed to grantthe territory independence with U.N. supervision.   Botha announced Wednesday that South Africa had placed itstroops on alert and was prepared to delay the elections due to analleged incursion by Namibian guerrillas. He said members of theU.N. monitoring force reported in internal radio traffic theinfiltration of 600 guerrillas from Oct. 26-31.   However, Fred Eckhard, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeepingtroops in Namibia, said Thursday the messages ``are phony incontent and format.''   South African military technicians investigating the matterfound the radio traffic was sent on frequencies allocated to theU.N. monitoring group, Botha said.   However, Botha's statement provided no evidence that it was U.N.personnel who sent the messages.   ``Whether it was a crackpot or (U.N. officials) is to me not theimportant issue,'' he said. ``My purpose is to avoid bloodshed.''   U.N. soldiers and territorial police regularly patrol the borderarea and have not reported any incursions. A reconnaissance team ofSouth Africans, Angolans and U.N. personnel also is searching theborder by helicopter, Botha said.   The Angola-Namibia border stretches for several hundred miles ofthinly populated scrub brush. Many civilians cross each way daily,ignoring the few isolated border posts.   The guerrillas and Angolan officials have denied that anyguerrillas are massing on the Angola-Namibia border or have crossedinto Namibia.   The U.S. State Department said Thursday it had no independentinformation to confirm the South African allegations.   The South-West Africa People's Organization is widely favored towin next week's elections and run Namibia's first independentgovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
