Below is Kume's contribution.</TEXT><BYLINE>By YUTAKA KUME</BYLINE><BYLINE>President, Nissan Motor Co.</BYLINE><BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   It has been said for a long time that the world is shifting froma bipolar structure, with the United States and the Soviet Unionhaving overwhelming influence, to a multipolar one.   The situation is changing quickly now. Symbolized by the openingof the Berlin Wall, there is rapid reconciliation between East andWest. There are calls to build a new political and economic orderfor the world in the 21st century, and expectations are mountingfor the United States to exercise its leadership.   Former President Reagan began the rebuilding of a strong UnitedStates ready and able to act as a true world leader. President Bushhas taken over where Reagan left off and moved forward. This isespecially so in the area of economic revitalization, and thefuture outlook appears to be bright.   Without doubt, the United States began to face up to itsproblems with the ``twin deficits'' in the area of the macroeconomyin the 1980s.   However, I would like to make note of the voices graduallygrowing in U.S. industry to make efforts to improve productivityand quality and to become more export-oriented.   I see it as evidence of a significant turning point for theoverall economy in the United States. Especially notable was thereport last June by the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyentitled ``Made in America.'' It was a proposal to bolster U.S.manufacturing industry, and it clearly pointed out problems inindustry and indicated directions for improvement.   The report:   _Criticized the pursuit of short-term profit.   _Said there was overconfidence in U.S. technology and delay inadapting to technological innovation.   _Found a lack of efforts to improve quality.   _Found disharmony in actions of the government and privatesector.   _Recommended increased investment, better education of the workforce, a more harmonized and cooperative relationship betweenorganizations and their employees, and more international thinking.   It is certainly true that U.S. leadership of the world'spolitics and economies since World War II has been sustained by itsindustrial competitiveness, based on its eminent productivity andtechnological strength.   Now, since the United States has begun to reconstruct itsmanufacturing industry, I believe the revitalization of the U.S.economy is real, and the United States will continue to hold thereins of power, leading the world politically and economically inthe future.   Many Japanese corporations, determined to satisfy changingcustomer wants and needs, have been opening up factories in theUnited States to put production close to the consumer.   We are making efforts to expand local employment, increase thelocal-content ratio of our products and blend into localcommunities. In other words, we have been establishing ourselves asU.S. corporations.   As international business activities continue to transcendnational boundaries, the need to bolster U.S. industrialcompetitiveness has already become an important issue, not only forcorporations with bases and business operations in America, butalso for us, corporations based in Japan.   We, as international business people, would like to contributeto the further strengthening of the U.S. economy.</TEXT><TEXT>   Yutaka Kume, 68, a 1944 graduate of the University of Tokyo,began work for Nissan in 1946.
