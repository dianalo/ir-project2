Capt. Larry Seaquist, the Iowa's commanding officer until lastMay, refused to speculate on the exact cause of the accident thatleft 47 sailors dead.   But he told reporters at a Pentagon briefing that an air systemto clear debris from the breech must be operated manually, raisingthe possibility that the procedure was overlooked before freshgunpowder was loaded into the gun during a firing exercise.   ``It seems from the reports that those powders exploded,''Seaquist said.   ``We simply do not know what caused that powder to go,'' hesaid. ``The early reports are that it was up in that gun room,''immediately behind the gun breeches.   Other Navy officers, speaking on condition they not beidentified by name, said red-hot debris ``seems to be the logicalexplanation'' for the explosion.   A Pentagon spokesman, Fred Hoffman, confirmed that the explosionoccurred ``during a firing exercise.''   One of the 47 men killed in the explosion was the lone officerstationed in the turret, Phillip Edward Buch, lieutenant juniorgrade, from Las Cruces, N.M.   The officer would normally be stationed in a small compartmentat the rear of the swivelling top of the turrent, adjacent to theroom in which shells are loaded.   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, en route home from a NATOmeeting in Brussels, said ``we have no eyewitnesses to whatactually transpired.''   ``I've been told in reports today that everyone who was in theturret at the time of the explosion was killed,'' Cheney said,apparently referring to the swiveling gun house at the top of theturret, rather than the mechanical compartments and ammunitionmagazines below it.   Under questioning by reporters, Seaquist said one possible causeof the explosion was debris left in the breech from a previousfiring.   To clear the breech of such debris, he said, a sailor mustmanually activate a one-inch tube containing air pressurized at3,000 pounds per square inch, and then visually inspect the breech.   ``It ejects the gases out of the muzzle of the gun,'' he said.   ``Each of these men is well-trained and formally qualified to dothis,'' he said, and they drill regularly.   The turret and the ship are constructed of thick steel and aredesigned in such a way that a fire or explosion in one compartmentof the turret will not spread to other sections, ignite powdermagazines and spread the damage.   ``This gun, the Mark VII, 16-inch 50 gun remains the finestnaval gun in the world. It was the pinnacle of gun design art, andit is still a front-line system,'' Seaquist said.   ``It was designed specifically to contain this kind of damage,to limit the cascading effects,'' he said, referring to explosionsthat occurred aboard ships of earlier designs.   At some point during the accident Wednesday, the crew floodedthe turret, activating an overhead sprinkler system that sprays thecompartments with pressurized salt water while still allowingsailors to scramble through exit hatches.   A complement of 74 sailors normally work inside each turret,said Seaquist.   Hoffman said ``the reports coming in from the ship indicate thatit was fully manned at the time of the firing ... There weresurvivors (in the turret).''   Hoffman said he could not say whether all of those killed wereinside the turret at the time of the explosion.   To launch a 1,900-pound projectile from the 62-foot-longbarrels, a team of sailors packs six gunpowder canisters weighing110 pounds each into the breech, Seaquist said.   The black gunpowder, a total of 660 pounds, is ignited,propelling the shell from the barrel at a speed of 1,500 miles anhour, he said. ``They actually don't explode. They burn extremelyrapidly ... in a matter of a fraction of a second.''   Hoffman declined to speculate on the exact cause of theexplosion, saying that Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commanderof the USS New Jersey, a sister ship to the Iowa, was directing theNavy board inquiry.   ``An investigation into the incident has already begun,''Hoffman said. He declined to predict when the inquiry would befinished, reviewed by the Navy and Defense Department, and thenreleased in summary to the public.   ``The ship ... experienced an explosion and a fire in its No. 2turret about 10 a.m. yesterday some 200 miles Northeast of PuertoRico,'' said Hoffman. ``The ship was part of an exercise calledFleetex-389.''   ``Reports from the Iowa say that 47 crewmen are dead. Between 10and 12 have suffered minor injuries. Most of these, I understand,are in the fire-fighting parties, Hoffman said. ``There are noserious injuries, and all those who have been hurt have beentreated aboard ship.''   Each of the three turrets aboard the Iowa has three 16-inchguns, is as tall as a seven-story building, and weighs 1,800 tons,as much as a World War II destroyer, Seaquist said.   The 17{-inch armor is so thick, he said, that when a Japaneseshell hit the No. 3 turret aboard the Iowa in World War II, ``thecrew inside didn't even know they had been hit. Now that is safetythat comes from this massive armor and the compartmentation.''   No one is known to have died in combat aboard the Iowa during acareer that spanned World War II, the Korean War and patrol dutyoff the mouth of the Persian Gulf last year.   The black gunpowder used aboard the Iowa was manufactured duringthe Korean War, and stored in Crane, Ind., in sealed bins, Seaquistsaid.   When the Iowa was recommissioned in 1984, the Navy emixed thegunpower, tested it and repacked it into the 110-pound charges thatare stored in a magazines at the base of the turret. The chargesare passed through revolving doors designed to seal the magazinefrom the rest of the turret and the ship.</TEXT></DOC>
