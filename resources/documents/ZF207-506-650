(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>286s No Frills, Few Thrills It's no secret that PC Magazine wholeheartedlyendorses the 386-based PC as the standard machine for business computing.andO;The 32-bit operation and memory-handling capabilities of 386-based PCs makethem far superior to 286-based systems, and Intel's aggressive January pricedrop for the 386SX chip virtually guarantees that the 386SX will somedayreplace the 286 as the entry-level business system.andM;At present, however, 286-based machines still dominate the PC market.andP;  The386 may constitute the fastest-growing market segment, but the 286 is stillthe biggest seller and probably will be for some time.andM;Why?andP;  The answer is price.andP;  For VGA systems, the averagestandard-configuration price of a 16-MHz 386 machine is about $1,300 over theaverage standard-configuration price of a 12-MHz 286 PC: $4,550 versus $3,250(based on figures from this roundup and those in the January 31 and May 30,1989, issues of PC Magazine).andM;A 386-minded consultant might point out that after factoring in a 5-yeardepreciation and the corresponding tax savings, the additional cost of a 386machine seems trivial and is more than justified by the increase in employeeproductivity.andP;  For individual consumers and corporations alike, however,depreciation and tax savings don't mean much when a PC is needed and $2,500is all the budget will allow.andP;  A 12-MHz 286 runs WordPerfect, OS/2, andPageMaker far better than a steno pad and No.andP;  2 pencil can.andM;Intel, Microsoft, and others promise that buying a 386 will pay off in thelong run, even for mundane computing chores: 32-bit OS/2 Presentation Managerapplications will bring such great innovations and productivity gains thatanyone who does not join the party will be left out in the rain.andP;  Even if youshare at least some faith in this happy vision of tomorrow-computing, youmust still grapple with the question of how far in the future its fulfillmentlies.andP;  Will any machine you buy now still be gasping along by the time thisnew world arrives?andM;286 KILLERandM;In theory, the 386SX--Intel's 286 killer--makes the timing a moot issue.andO;Though boasting all the functionality of the 386, including 32-bit internaloperation, the 16-MHz 386SX communicates with the remainder of the system viaa 16-bit bus, just like the 286.andP;  Manufacturers therefore should be able toproduce a 386SX-based machine as cheaply as a 286 machine of the same speed.andO;The price differential between a 286/12 and a 16-MHz 386SX should be $500 atmost.andM;That hasn't happened yet, at least not on a large scale, primarily because ofthe limited supply and original high price of the 386SX chip.andP;  In January,Intel lowered the SX bulk price from the original $165 to $89 per chip inquantities of 1,000.andP;  (Typically, 12-MHz 286 chips cost $20 to $30 each inlike quantities, while 16-MHz 286 chips sell for $60 to $80.)andP;  Intel has alsostepped up production of its SX chips.andP;  These moves have prompted severalvendors, including Compaq, to reduce the prices of their 386SX machines.andP;  Atleast one vendor--Club AT--has announced a base-configuration 386SX machineat a price below $2,000.andP;  The trend can only continue.andM;Do lower SX prices augur the death of the 286?andP;  Yes--maybe.andP;  The 386SX willkill off anything within a few hundred dollars of its price range.andP;  16-MHzand 20-MHz 286 machines, which require components just as expensive as thoseof a 16-MHz 386SX, will die a quick death.andM;The 286/12 stands a chance, but just barely.andP;  Any cost incentive the 286/12can legitimately claim results from its slower, less expensive DRAM and itsless expensive processor.andP;  Assuming that DRAM and the 386SX chip itselfcontinue to fall in price, the 286/12 cost incentive will continue todwindle.andM;Of course, the will of PC vendors also affects pricing and availability.andO;Some vendors, like Compaq, continue to introduce new 286 machines and lower286 prices.andP;  Other vendors seem content to let the 286 rest in peace.andO;Advanced Logic Research recently began shipping a 386SX priced at $1,795, thesame price as its 12.5-MHz 286.andP;  It subsequently discontinued the 286 ratherthan lowering its pricetag.andP;  Whether the move resulted from a real concernfor the buyers' best interests, the desire to be viewed as a forward-lookingcompany, pressure from Intel, or a combination of these, the end result isthe same.andM;THE BOTTOM LINEandM;What does it all mean?andP;  It's simple: whether or not you share Intel's visionof a 386/386SX world, there will be a time, soon, when pricing andpresent-day performance alone will justify acceptance of the 386SX as theentry-level business machine.andP;  It may not happen overnight, but it willhappen.andP;  In the meantime, the 286/12 remains an attractive entry-leveloption--if you're prepared to live with its limitations for years to come.andM;If money is no object, buy a full-powered 386-based machine.andP;  If you can'tstomach 386 prices, try a 386SX.andP;  By the time this issue hits the newsstands,you should be able to find a few attractive deals, and you'll buy with thesecurity of knowing you're ready for whatever &quot;killer apps&quot; tomorrow has instore.andM;But if your decision is between buying a 286-based machine and not buying atall, or if you honestly don't care about the wonderful applications the 386promises to inspire, then take the plunge.andP;  The 286 has been the mainstay ofbusiness computing for some time now, and the 386 and 386SX haven't caused itto run any slower.andM;A MATTER OF PRIORITYandM;Should you decide to buy a 12-MHz 286, your first item of business should bedetermining what's most important to you in a machine.andP;  How you rank theimportance of several factors--compatibility, economy, speed, andservice--will largely determine which machine you should buy.andP;  No one machineoffers the best of all, but several provide good overall performance.andM;Compatibility involves much more than simply which BIOS each machine uses.andO;Some vendors write their own BIOSs, but most machines use either the AMI,Award, or Phoenix BIOS.andP;  While Phoenix enjoys the best reputation forcompatibility, BIOS makers and large PC vendors alike have had plenty of timeby now to fine-tune their code.andP;  Be it the Award, AMI, Compaq, or EverexBIOS, you shouldn't have to worry about BIOS incompatibilities.andM;Similarly, most of the machines we looked at here are based on one of ahandful of 286 chip sets--from Chips and Technologies, Faraday (a subsidiaryof Western Digital), Intel, Suntac, or VLSI Technologies.andP;  While no batteryof tests can try compatibility as effectively as months of real-world use,all of the machines--including those based on the Suntac, a relativenewcomer--performed flawlessly on PC Labs' tests.andM;The biggest area of uncertainty lies in the machines' compatibility witholder expansion boards designed to work with PCs, XTs, or early ATs.andP;  Oneindicator is bus speed.andP;  If you intend to run older expansion cards, youshould consider buying a machine that can run the bus at 6 MHz.andP;  Several ofthe machines build bus-speed switching into the turbo switch, which isprimarily a processor speed control, or let you choose among two or threealternative bus speeds by setting DIP switches or jumpers on the motherboard.andO;Such flexibility of control allows you to find the top speed at which yourexpansion cards will operate properly.andM;Expansion-card compatibility also involves more-complicated issues, such ashow machines handle memory-refresh cycles.andP;  Compaq and a handful of othermanufacturers have gone to great lengths to ensure compatibility with everyexpansion card ever to grace the bus of a PC, usually at the cost ofperformance.andP;  If you won't be moving old cards into your new machine, theperformance sacrifices do nothing but slow you down.andM;At the opposite end of the spectrum, some of the fastest machines to maketheir way into this roundup were also the least expensive, built by assemblyhouses using low-cost, high-performance motherboards and brand-namecomponents.andP;  The Destiny, MultiMicro, and Telemart machines fit thisdescription, and each is based on the Suntac chip set.andP;  Will you haveexpansion-card compatibility problems with these machines?andP;  Probably not, butif it's that important to you, you should probably look elsewhere or choose amachine with a 30-day money-back guarantee.andP;  Again, you must set yourpriorities.andM;Finally, a word about mail-order PCs.andP;  Some mail-order vendors, such asCompuAdd, Dell, and Northgate, have been around for so long and have earnedsuch excellent reputations for quality and service that their machines are assafe a buy as anything.andP;  The machine components are the same, month aftermonth, and the documentation, technical support, and service are tops.andM;On the other hand, there are bargain-basement assembly houses that buildtheir PCs from whatever motherboard and name-brand components are cheapestthat week and then ship the PC with documentation that is meager oraltogether inaccurate.andP;  These machines deliver the best bang per buck around,and they will probably run just fine.andP;  But it's also likely that you'll spendinordinate amounts of time trying to decipher the documentation, get thecover of the flimsy case back on, or reach a technical support person to findout which jumper controls what.andP;  If you love to tinker with your PC, you'lllove these machines.andP;  If you expect your PC to be a trouble-free servantrather than a hobby, go with a more established, more conventional vendor.andO;The reviews in this issue, as well as those in the January 31, 1989, issue,should give you a good feel for what sort of quality, documentation, andservice you can expect from each vendor.andM;THE LINEUPandM;This roundup encompasses a field of 21 of the latest desktop 12-MHz machines,including Compaq's new Deskpro 286e.andP;  For obvious reasons, machines wereviewed in the January 31 issue--including machines by Dell, Zeos, andothers, as well as the Austin and Northgate Editor's Choices--are notreviewed here.andP;  But we have made every attempt to keep these machines in mindduring the evaluation process.andP;  Some of the vendors we contacted, includingAmstrad, Gateway 2000, and Twinhead, failed to send machines, although wecontacted them well in advance of the deadline.andP;  Other manufacturers are notrepresented either because, like Tandy, they do not offer a 12-MHz machine,or because, like Zenith with its new Z-286 LP/12, they were not shipping atthe time of our testing.andP;  As usual, we eliminated vendors who are active onlyas original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or who sell strictly to valueadded resellers (VARs).andM;If there is an obvious common thread among the machines reviewed here asidefrom their speed, it is their size and appearance.andP;  Nearly every machineoccupies less desktop space than the power-user ATs of old; and manufacturersseem to be acquiring a regard for aesthetics, if only because buyers aredemanding nicer-looking PCs.andP;  However visually appealing the new chasis maybe, the important question is to what extent these machines can be upgradedand how.andP;  We address that issue both in the individual reviews and in thesidebar &quot;How Far Can They Go?&quot;andM;As you examine the features table and reviews that follow, remember that inany purchasing decision no factor is more important than your own needs andpreferences.andP;  Also keep in mind that the prices cited for each machine aresuggested list prices.andP;  While mail-order vendors typically advertise a priceand stick to it, other companies often list an inflated price and offerdiscounts to dealers and large accounts.andP;  The actual selling price can be 30percent lower than the list, depending on the company and dealer.andM;HOW FARandM;CAN THEY GO?andM;Whether you're agonizing over the 286-versus-386 issue or simply trying todecide which 286 to buy, upgrade considerations should play a major role inyour purchasing decision.andP;  Just how far into the future a 286 machine willtake you depends on which machine you buy and how much money you're willingto pour into it later.andM;First, even if you're banking on the 286's ability to run OS/2 to carry youinto the future, you'll need to plan on buying plenty of RAM.andP;  OS/2 requiresa bare minimum of 2.5 megabytes, and you're much better off with 4.andM;That being the case, the maximum amount of RAM a system's motherboard willaccommodate becomes important: while memory added through expansion cards islimited by the speed of the bus--8 MHz, or perhaps even 6 MHz--motherboardRAM flies along at a full 12 MHz, often with zero wait states.andP;  The amount ofmotherboard RAM may mean the difference between being able to live with your12-MHz 286 or having to cough up the dough for a faster machine.andM;Another feature to look for is LIM 4.0 capability.andP;  The latest chip sets byChips and Technologies, Suntac, and VLSI Technology have the memory-handlingfeatures necessary to implement LIM 4.0 fully, using all that extended memoryon your motherboard.andM;Of course, when it comes to system upgrades, the number of drive bays andexpansion slots always rates as an important consideration.andP;  Several of themachines in this roundup sacrifice a few slots and a drive bay or two for thesake of aesthetics or to conserve desktop space.andP;  Think seriously about whatyour future needs may be before you opt for one of these models.andM;What recourse will you have if you find you just can't live without a 386?andO;The 386SX's 16-bit external data path, as well as its relatively low cost,makes it a natural for 286 upgrades, and several vendors have announced orare already shipping upgrade products based on the 386SX.andM;The Cumulus 80386SX card, which should be shipping by the time this issuemakes it into print, promises to be among the most dependable and leastexpensive of the lot.andP;  With a list price of $595, the card measures less than3 square inches and plugs directly into the 286 socket, simply replacing the286 with a 386SX microprocessor and effecting the necessary translation.andO;Cumulus reports that it will support all three 286 socket standards: PGA,LCC, and PLCC.andP;  The company also plans to offer an adapter that accommodatesan 80387SX math coprocessor.andP;  Everex is offering a similar, $699 386SXdaughtercard that works only with the Everex Step 286-12.andM;Neither of these cards will increase your system's clock speed or makestandard applications run any faster; though rated at 16 MHz, the 386SX canrun only as fast as the system that drives it.andP;  What these cards will do isallow you to run all the software you could run on a 386, includingWindows/386 and Paradox 386.andM;Taking a slightly different approach, SOTA Technology promises a solutionthat will both replace the 286 with the 386SX and run the 386SX at a higherclock speed.andP;  The product, planned for fourth-quarter shipment, will comprisea 16-bit adapter with a 20-MHz 386SX processor and 16K static RAM cache(upgradable to 64K), according to SOTA.andP;  It will also contain a socket forthe 80387SX.andP;  The PGA-socket version will retail for $695, and the LCC/PLCCversion will list at $795.andP;  The company claims performance gains of 300percent for an 8-MHz AT and 200 percent for a 12-MHz machine.andM;You might even opt for one of the 386 accelerator boards that have been onthe market for a good while.andP;  Intel's popular Inboard 386/PC does not support12-MHz 286 machines, but the $1,799 PC-Elevator 386, by Applied ReasoningCorp., and the $1,299 Jet 386, by Orchid Technology, do.andP;  Both run at 16 MHz,and both include 32-bit RAM to optimize performance.andM;Of the three basic approaches--a simple 386SX plug-in card, a 386SXaccelerator, and a 386 accelerator--using a 386SX plug-in card should proveby far the most trouble-free.andP;  Just make sure the machine you buy has asocketed processor.andM;Does it make sense to buy a 286 now and add a 386SX adapter or 386accelerator later?andP;  Not really.andP;  Even with one of the inexpensive adapters,you'll spend more on the 286 system and board together than you would havespent on a 386SX.andP;  If you're determined to buy a 286, however, rest assuredthat upgrade options are out there.andM;12-MHZ 286 PCS: SUMMARY OF FEATURESandM;The following commentary analyzes some of the terms in this table offeatures.andP;  The phrases in bold type are listed in the same order as in theleft-hand column of the table.andM;Basic configurationandM;This price represents the most stripped-down machine the vendor will sell,typically including 1MB RAM, one floppy disk drive, and serial and parallelports.andM;Hard disk optionsandM;The available hard disks are identified in terms of their storage capacity.andO;Each disk uses an ST-506 interface except as otherwise indicated (see diskcontroller interface/encoding, below).andP;  The number of different hard disksthe vendor offers for a machine is often indicative of how much customizingis available.andM;Standard configurationandM;For the sake of price comparisons, our &quot;standard&quot; configuration normallyincludes 1MB RAM, a 40MB hard disk, at least one floppy disk drive, a VGAmonitor, at least one parallel and one serial port, DOS, and a keyboard.andO;Because the closest approximation of our standard package may differ fromthis configuration, the price of each system is followed by the total RAM (ifother than 1MB), the size of the hard disk (if other than 40MB), and anyother departures from our specification.andM;Tested configurationandM;The specifications of the evaluation units depend on what configuration eachmanufacturer has sent us (based on our guidelines).andM;Bus clock speedsandM;Bus speed becomes more important as computers run at faster clock speeds.andP;  Acomputer's bus speed may actually be too fast for expansion cards, most ofwhich operate at 8 or 10 MHz.andP;  Time-out periods, sometimes called waitstates, are often used to slow down the bus.andM;Disk controller interface/encodingandM;Several interfaces are used to control the way data is transferred from thehard disk to the computer.andP;  The most common disk interface standard isST-506/412, used in the IBM PC-XT and PC AT.andP;  Two other common data transferinterfaces are SCSI (Small Computer System Interfac) and ESDI (Enhanced SmallDevice Interface).andP;  Both SCSI and ESDI require special hard disk controllersand cannot run off existing PC-XT or PC AT controllers.andM;Disk encoding techniques currently include RLL (Run Length Limited) and theolder MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation) scheme.andP;  All data is encoded ontoand read from your hard disk as a series of polarity-reversing bitsrepresenting ones and zeros.andP;  Nine such bits would be needed to store 12 bitsof data in MFM format, and only six polarity changes are required with RLLformat; thus, MFM takes more space than RLL but provides a more stableenvironment and is more commonly used.andP;  ST-506 technology, for instance, usesthe MFM encoding scheme.andM;BIOS version and dateandM;The BIOS date is important to those planning to use 3-1/2-inch disk drives.andO;Early BIOS versions cannot handle this format.andM;Memory chip typeandM;Kb and Mb refer to kilobits and megabits, respectively.andM;Chip packagingandM;Memory chips come in a variety of styles: DIPs, SIPs, and SIMMs.andP;  The DualIn-line Package (DIP) is the traditional buglike computer chip sprouting 8,14, 24, or even 40 or more metal legs (evenly divded between right and leftsides).andP;  Single In-line Packages (SIPs) are single-package arrays of computerchip logic assembled so that all connecting legs are in a straight line, likethe teeth on a comb.andM;Single In-line Memory Modules (SIMMs), on the other hand, are individuallogic devices that are installed on their own smal circuit board, creating acomponent module that can be plugged into a larger device.andP;  Their physicalarrangement duplicates the integrated structure of a SIP but allows for thepossibility of replacing an individual memory component if necessary.andM;All of the computers in this features table use dynamic RAM chips (DRAMs).andO;These cost less and are more common than static RAM chips (SRAMs), but theyalso yield slower performance.andM;Interleaved memoryandM;CPU Speed is usually faster than memory speed.andP;  Interleaved memory increasesprocessing speed by splitting the memory into two or more portions.andP;  The CPUthen sends information to a section at a time, allowing one section toprocess while another receives data.andM;Shadow RAMandM;Shadow RAM is a Technology that loads system BIOS and/or video BIOS directlyinto fast RAM on boot-up of the computer.andP;  The BIOS then operates muchfaster.andM;FCC certification classandM;Two classes of FCC (Federal Communications Commission) approval may be givento computers: Class A and Class B.andP;  These classes concern levels ofradio-frequency interference.andP;  With Class A approval, a computer may beoperated in a business locale.andP;  The tougher Class B rating allows home use aswell, where computers are likely to be placed near radios and televisionsets.andM;THE SERVICE QUESTIONandM;Personal computers are surprisingly reliable, and it's tempting to makepurchase decisions based just on hardware features, performance, and price.andO;But what do you do if something goes wrong?andP;  Your choices include fixing ityourself, carrying or shipping the computer to a dealer or vendor, or buyingan on-site service contract.andP;  You can take your chances, hoping thateverything will be OK, and face the question only if a component fails--butif your business computer needs demand that serivce interruptions be minimal,it makes sense to plan ahead.andP;  Many businesses today demand on-site servicecontracts as the least disruptive way to handle service problems.andM;Of course, computer systems come with parts-and-labor warranties, usually ineffect for 1 year.andP;  Pleasant exceptions include Arche Technologies' machineswith 2-year coverage, as well as Hyundai Electronics America and HeadStartTechnologies Co., both of which give 18-month warranties.andP;  Warranties don'tusually cover shipping costs, however.andP;  Unless you have an on-site servicecontract, you are responsible for delivering or shipping a failed componentto a dealer, vendor, or service center.andP;  If the serivce site is local, timemust be spent carrying the machine to and from the location; the service youget is called carry-in or depot service.andM;Shipping a machine to a remote vendor is costly.andP;  For example, sending a45-pound, AT-class computer insured at $2,000 from Connecticut to San Diegofor second-day delivery costs $50.25 via UPS or $63.60 with Federal Express(including pick-up at your office).andP;  Next-day service costs even more: $66.50for delivery by noon via UPS, or $96.35 for delivery by 10:30 A.M.andP;  viaFederal Express.andM;Most people don't ship computers for service unless they buy them frommail-order dealers that don't use local service firms.andP;  Standard practicewith most mail-order companies is what's called &quot;mirror&quot; shipping, in whichthe vendor pays to ship the computer back to you and uses the same shippingmethod you selected.andP;  The only exception to this practice among majormail-order vendors is HiTech International in Milpitas, California; thiscompany insists on having customers pay shipping both ways, even for warrantyservice.andP;  HiTech maintains that part of the secret of offering low systemprices lies in not making people whose machines never fail subsidize theshipping costs for the few machines that do.andM;After you've carried in or shipped your computer, turnaround time--the timeit takes to diagnose and repair your machine--varies so widely that we canonly generalize.andP;  In most cases, figure 2 to 5 business days, with betterresponse from larger dealers or vendors with adequate staffing.andM;For fastest response and repair turnaround, get yourself an on-site servicecontract.andP;  Depending on the contract's specifics, you'll be up and running inanywhere from 4 hours to 2 business days.andP;  Some on-site contracts eveninclude a provision for equipment loaners if the repair can't be made on thespot.andP;  Large corporations increasingly specify on-site service contracts intheir orders.andM;Mail-order companies, in their never-ending fight for credibility, rely moreand more on on-site service contracts, often including them free with systempurchases.andP;  Some machines sold only through dealers include standard on-siteservice contracts as well.andP;  Austin Computer Systems, Dell Computer Corp.,andO;FiveStar Computers, Fortron Corp., HeadStart Technologies Co., Hertz ComputerCorp., Northgate Computer Systems, Premier Computer Innovations, Telemart,and Televideo Systems all give free on-site service through the duration ofthe warranty.andM;Two companies, recognizing that most part failures occur early in acomputer's life, offer full-year warranties but include on-site service forjust part of the time: Hewlett-Packard Co. for the first 90 days and AcerTechnologies Corp. for the first 4 months of the warranty period.andM;If your computer doesn't come with an on-site contract as standard, you canusually buy one from the dealer, whether local or mail-order, or from anational service center such as TRW, Sorbus, or GE-OnSite, all of which havesites in major metropolitan areas in the U.S.andP;  These, incidentally, are thecompanies that most mail-order dealers use for their on-site contraxts.andM;ComputerLand franchise stores in the New England area sell on-site contractsat yearly rates ranging from 8 to 12 percent of the original system listprice.andP;  For the $4,448 Compaq Deskpro 286e reviewed in this issue, a 1-yearcontract would cost between $355 and $533, the difference determined by thelenght of the response time.andP;  A 1-year contract for the $2,267 Tusseycomputer Prodcuts Swan 286/12, including the VGA monitor, costs $270 (Tusseysells the contract but Sorbus provides the service).andM;Carry-in, mail-in, and on-site service aren't the only ways to get help.andO;Some of the better-known mail-order vendors offer special ways to help withsystem problems: quick, cheap, and effective if you can do some of your ownwork.andP;  Many vendors, including CompuAdd Corp., Tussey Computer Products, andZeos International offer toll-free technical support.andP;  DataWorld uses anothertechnique: since all of its systems include the &quot;host&quot; half of theremote-operation software pcAnywhere III, DataWorld's technicians candiagnose your system via telephone (you must provide a modem and phone linefor them to get into your system).andM;If you're hardware savvy and have the time, you can often perform computerservice yourself, which in most cases consists of either tightening cablesand cards or locating and replacing failed components.andP;  However, if you don'thave the time, the computer knowledge, and the inclination to figure out andfix problems yourself, on-site service contracts are your best bet.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
