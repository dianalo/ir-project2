A year earlier, Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. had net income of $11.6 million or 23 cents a share. The troubled thrift concern previously said it expected a loss in this year's second quarter of $150 million to $200 million.    Analysts said the big loss provision is evidence of Financial Corp.'s continuing troubles and increases the likelihood that the company will be merged into another institution with financial assistance from federal regulators.    The leading candidate to absorb Financial Corp. is Ford Motor Co., through its San Francisco-based First Nationwide Bank unit. On Wednesday, another major bidder, an investor group led by former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, said it would drop its &quot;active pursuit&quot; of Financial Corp. to concentrate on other potential acquisitions.    The loss cut Financial Corp.'s net worth -- assets minus liabilities -- to $140.3 million, or 0.4% of assets, from $320.2 million or 0.9% of assets at March 31. The capital of its American Savings andamp; Loan Association unit, figured by regulatory accounting rules, fell to $382.9 million from $560.9 million at March 31. The most recent amount is about $1.24 billion short of the capital required by federal regulators.    Financial Corp. said a portion of its second-quarter loss provision had been required by a recent change in rules on accounting for renegotiated loans. However, the company didn't specify how much of the provision stemmed from the rule change, which took effect in April.    In addition, Financial Corp. wrote off its $22.7 million investment in the secondary reserve of the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., as required by federal regulators and current accounting rules.    Financial Corp. said its operating loss in the quarter narrowed to $9.7 million from $14.3 million a year earlier. Gains on the sale of loans and mortgage-backed securities, which have provided most of Financial Corp.'s profit in recent quarters, fell to $18.3 million from $85.1 million because rising interest rates depressed the value of fixed-rate loans and securities.    Scheduled items, which are delinquent loans and foreclosed real estate after subtracting loss reserves, were $1.38 billion at June 30, down from $1.68 billion at March 31. Scheduled items fell because the amount of delinquent loans declined and because of the loss provision, which boosted reserves, a Financial Corp. spokeswoman said.    Financial Corp. noted that it continues to report scheduled items under old rules, rather than the rules that have been in effect since January 1986, because it is still discussing the effect of the new rules with regulators. Analysts and thrift executives believe the new rules will force Financial Corp. to make even bigger loan loss provisions.    Jonathan E. Gray, a thrift analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., said Financial Corp. &quot;is in a very vulnerable position&quot; because of its thin capital base and high level of nonearning assets. He noted that a letter from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board promising not to take action against Financial Corp. because of its capital deficiency expires in eight months.    Financial Corp. said it had a net outflow of deposits in the second quarter of $381.7 million, or about 2.2% of its $17.3 billion total. The company said the outflow was &quot;almost entirely&quot; from institutional deposits, and was the result of Financial Corp.'s pricing strategy. Institutional deposits generally exceed the maximum insured amount of $100,000.    Financial Corp.'s common stock fell 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $3.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    People familiar with the Bank Board's discussions with potential acquirers of Financial Corp. said that Ford has an advantage over the Simon group because the highly protitable auto maker is better able to use the tax benefits -- estimated at more than $1 billion -- that would flow from absorbing Financial Corp. with regulatory assistance. </TEXT></DOC>
