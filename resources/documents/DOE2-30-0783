<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0783 </DOCNO><TEXT>During this reporting period, the focus of activity in the Materials Sciencewith Muon Spin Rotation (MSMSR) program was muon spin rotation studiesof superconducting materials, in particular the high critical temperatureand heavy-fermion materials. Apart from these studies, work was continuedon the analysis of muon motion in metal hydrides. Results of these experimentsare described in six papers included as appendices.</TEXT></DOC>
