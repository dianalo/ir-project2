SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   East Germany's struggling Communists calledfor a ``human, democratic socialism'' and stressed their oppositionto German reunification as an emergency party congress ended Sunday.   The 2,700 Communist delegates scrapped their old party platformand adopted a new one designed to guide the party until its nextregular congress in February.   The congress ended with a new name for the discredited party,which is trying to maintain a role for itself as elections approachnext May. Delegates changed the party's official name from theSocialist Unity Party of Germany to the Socialist Unity Party ofGermany-Party of Democratic Socialism.   Under pressure from mass pro-democracy protests, the party inthe past two months has ousted hard-line leaders, opened the BerlinWall and other borders, promised free elections and ushered inreforms.   In the latest change, Premier Hans Modrow announced that EastGermany's new domestic intelligence services will be under directcontrol of the government. The new agency will replace the hatedMinistry for National Security, which was dissolved.   The new Communist platform says the party roots lie in the``Communist and social democratic workers' movement,'' a phraseaimed at disassociating the party from 40 years of Stalinist rulefrom the top.   ``The goal is a new, human, democratic socialism'' in EastGermany, the platform said, in an echo of a phrase used by formerCzechoslovak Communist leader Alexander Dubcek. Dubcek's attempt tocreate ``socialism with a human face'' was crushed by East Germanyand four other Warsaw Pact nations that invaded his country in 1968.   ``It was the first democratic party congress we have staged indecades,'' East German party chief Gregor Gysi told delegates.   Gysi, a 41-year-old lawyer who has defended the rights of theopposition, was elected to head the Communists during the firstpart of the congress Dec. 9-10. The meeting resumed on Saturday.   In a keynote speech Sunday, Gysi urged further political,economic and military reforms.   He reiterated the Communists' opposition to Germanreunification, saying East Germany must remain ``a humanistic,socially oriented alternative'' to its capitalist western neighbor,the official news agency ADN reported.   He said the existence of two Germanys is ``the guarantee forensuring peace and stability in Europe,'' according to ADN.   However, in Leipzig on Sunday, delegates at the founding partycongress of Democratic Awakening, a church-led reform movement,voted 350-35 that the right of German unity should be inscribed inthe East German constitution.   Gysi also urged the adoption of a new national constitution andcreation of a supreme court to defend it. He urged a reduction inthe length of army service and ``an immediate freeing of militarycapacities for the economy.''   Gysi called for discussions with church leaders on a lawprotecting religion in East Germany. He said the Communists favorprotecting ``Jewish religion and culture'' and urged Modrow'sgovernment to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.   Modrow was quoted by an Israeli newspaper Sunday as saying EastGermany is willing to change its policy of denying responsibilityfor the Nazi Holocaust as a way to establish diplomatic ties withIsrael.   ``We have approached Israel officially with a request to discussestablishing diplomatic relations,'' Modrow was quoted as saying inan interview in the daily Haaretz.   While West Germany has paid billions of dollars in reparationsto Holocaust survivors, East Germany traditionally has deniedresponsibility on the grounds that it did not exist as a state atthe time.   On Saturday, meanwhile, President Bush said he would be ``veryresponsive'' to any request from East Germany for emergencywintertime food aid.</TEXT></DOC>
