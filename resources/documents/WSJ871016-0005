According to a National Research Council study that the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics requested, the accuracy of basic department measures such as the number of work-related fatalities is unknown, and the government hasn't made adequate efforts to check injury reports employers make against independent sources like death certificates and hospital records.    The council is an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, a federally chartered private organization that does scientific studies at the government's request.    The council's report is critical of the data-collection methods used by the bureau and by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The study said OSHA officials have little understanding of how some data could be used to effectively manage their programs. And the bureau's data systems can't provide OSHA with the information it needs because they aren't detailed enough, the panel concluded.    Responding to the report, Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, called the study &quot;thorough, timely and well thought-out.&quot; She said that in some cases, the bureau already is working to improve its data collection, and she pledged to study all the panel's recommendations.    Among those were suggestions to list categories of injuries, like amputations and burns, and also group together those that result in death, hospitalization or surgery. The commissioner said a pilot project on such reporting planned for this fiscal year will address that issue.    A spokesman for OSHA called the report a &quot;useful road map&quot; for improvements in data collection and evaluation. But he said that the report seemed to suggest &quot;an ideal world,&quot; and that OSHA is subject to limitations on technological, human and financial resources and because of the need for privacy.    Margaret Seminario, associate director of safety and health for the AFL-CIO and a member of the research panel praised the report, saying, &quot;We need major reforms to ensure proper and complete data.&quot; Davitt McAteer, director of the Occupational Safety and Health Law Center, a non-profit group, said the labor bureau's reporting system initially was established simply to get an overview of occupational hazards, but that the government and industries now should have enough experience to collect comprehensive information.    The study comes in the wake of a series of stiff fines OSHA has issued in recent months for safety record-keeping violations. Some critics have charged that OSHA's aggressive moves, including fines against Union Carbide Corp., Chrysler Corp. and a unit of General Dynamics Corp., were a reaction to congressional criticism of the agency. OSHA officials say they are pursuing the record-keeping issue because their inspectors use the records to decide which work sites need more complete reviews. </TEXT></DOC>
