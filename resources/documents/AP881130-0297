The fatter offer from the group led by chief executive F. RossJohnson topped its $22.7 billion proposal submitted at 5 p.m.Tuesday, which was the deadline the company had established forfinal bids.   The move sent RJR's stock roaring higher, partly in anticipationthat the unprecedented auction might be prolonged yet again.   RJR outside directors conducting the auction said earlier in theday that they were evaluating all bids and an announcement wouldcome later. But Johnson's surprise delayed the directors'deliberations and their intentions were unclear by late Wednesday.   There also was no word from Johnson's main competitors in thehistoric takeover fight, buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co. and the investment firm First Boston Corp.   But sources familiar with the bidding said they understoodKohlberg also may have raised its offer after the deadline in afrantic effort to stay in the race. Those sources said Johnson'sgroup may have raised its offer even higher, to as much as $24.75billion. Neither report could be confirmed.   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified, alsosaid First Boston was still in the auction, contrary to some reportsthat said it had withdrawn.   The sources said First Boston's bid was valued at between $103and $115 a share, or $23.17 billion and $25.87 billion, but wasconsidered more tentative than the others and given practically nochance of success.   They said that before Johnson's last-minute offer, Kohlbergappeared to be the winner with its own sweetened bid of more than$23.1 billion. Kohlberg was so confident it had triumphed that thefirm's senior officers were said to be standing by to arrange pressinterviews.   The events led many speculators and securities analysts watchingthe biggest takeover fight in history to conclude that it wasn'tover.   ``We've got an auction going,'' said John Maxwell, a strategistat Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va. ``If you were an RJRdirector, would you say everything is closed, goodbye? I don't seehow they can really close it down for a while. They don't have todecide right away. There's no rule.''   Although Johnson's move came as a surprise, it wasn'tinconsistent with the unpredictable takeover brawl that already hassmashed all records and raised major concerns about the frenziedlevel of dealmaking on Wall Street.   The management group said in a brief statement that it wasprepared to offer $108 a share for the company, vs. the $101 a shareoffer submitted Tuesday, $100 a share offer of Nov. 18, $84 a shareoffer of Nov. 4 and $75-a-share opening salvo Oct. 20 thatprecipitated the takeover struggle.   The group said the latest offer included $84 a share in cash,preferred stock it valued at $20 and additional preferred stock itvalued at $4, convertible into 15 percent of the common stock in theacquired company.   Johnson's group also promised unspecified protection to RJR'semployees and said they were prepared to further negotiate ``allaspects of their proposal, including price.''   Sources familiar with the Kohlberg bid said it was worth $103 ashare, vs. its earlier $94-a-share offer. The cash component of thelatest bid was said to be about $95.   A crucial element of each proposal is the portion of cash eachbidder intends to pay, because the value of the securities segmentis difficult to determine. These securities often are worth lessthan their face amount.   RJR stock surged in frantic New York Stock Exchange trading andthe Big Board briefly halted it when buy orders overwhelmed sellorders. The stock resumed trading by midafternoon and closed up$2.25 to $93 on volume exceeding 6.7 million shares.   RJR stock was trading at less than $56 a share when the battlebegan in late October.   Johnson's group incited the battle in October when he proposed totake the nation's 19th-largest industrial company private byborrowing massive amounts of money to acquire all RJR shares, atransaction known as a leveraged buyout.   RJR's board of directors then put the company up for sale toattract rival bids and conducted the first round of an auction Nov.18-20. They decided to prolong it because the offers received weretoo vague and inadequate.   Based in Atlanta, RJR is one of the largest consumer productscompanies, with more than 120,000 employees. It makes well-knownbrands that range from Camel cigarettes to Shredded Wheat cereal toLife Savers mints.</TEXT></DOC>
