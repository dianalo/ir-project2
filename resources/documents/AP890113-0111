(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President-elect Bush arrived this morningfor a pre-inaugural weekend of fishing to ``clear the mind'' for thetask ahead.   ``I doubt I'll get another chance to come here as president,'' hesaid in this self-proclaimed sportfishing capital. ``There won't beany winter or summer White House anywhere. I have no intention ofbuilding something else.''   Bush arrived at Marathon Airport aboard Air Force Two. He wasdressed casually in a blue blazer, gray slacks and boat shoes.   ``Why go fishing?'' asked Bush, whose inauguration is Jan. 20.``Contentment, environment, total relaxation, peace of mind, clearthe mind for the decisions ahead.''   He said he was looking forward to ``splendid isolation'' on hisvisit to the Florida Keys.   Bush was greeted by pigtailed 6-year-old Melissa DeFoor, daughterof the local sheriff. Wearing a flowered dress and black patentleather shoes, she said she was ``very excited'' about thepresident-elect's arrival.   The vice president and a crew of Washington fishing buddiesplanned to drive 32 miles north, check into a townhouse, then headfor the shallows of Florida Bay.   Fishing guide George Hommell, who has taken Bush out before, saidhe had his 17-foot skiff ready for excursions into EvergladesNational Park waters and the home of ``bonefish, which is probablythe fastest fish in the world.''   Weather permitting, Bush will spend all three days of his weekendpursuing redfish, snook, sea trout, ladyfish, jack and barracuda,Hommell said.   ``These are all fish that you use light tackle for, with 8- or10-pound test line, and you cast in shallow water,'' he said.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady was expected to join Bush,along with Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; Dr. Burton James Lee III ofMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York; Fred Zeder, asenior transition adviser and longtime friend; and the usualentourage of Secret Service agents and reporters.   The excursion is Bush's third fishing or hunting trip since hiselection two months ago. He went fishing in Gulf Stream, Fla., inNovember and went hunting and fishing in Texas and Alabama the weekafter Christmas.   It was not the first stay for Bush in this island community of5,000. Bush also spent time last April at Tarpon Flats, a townhousedevelopment where prices start at $425,000.   J.W. ``Jim'' Gibbs, executive director of the Islamorada Chamberof Commerce, was elated at the prospect of another Bush visit.   ``We've had him here many times before and we've enjoyed hisvisits,'' he said. ``The nice thing about our area is they come torelax and escape all the hubbub, and that's what we allow them todo.''</TEXT></DOC>
