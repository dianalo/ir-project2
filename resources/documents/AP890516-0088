Alan Shaw, manager of the Office of Technology Assessment'sinternational security and commerce program, said the once-largeU.S. advantage in a variety of defense technologies has beenreduced.   ``The defense technology base is not in crisis,'' Shaw told theSenate Armed Services subcommittee on defense industry andtechnology. ``But it does face major problems.''   Among those problems, cited in a report released today by theOffice of Technology Assessment, are an increase in the number offoreign competitors, a vast number of rules and regulations thatslow the acquisition process and delays in translating researchinto practical use.   In addition, these problems will worsen in the face of``declining defense budgets and the erosion of high technologyindustry in the United States,'' Shaw said.   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the subcommittee, saidthe United States in this century has ``convincingly demonstratedour superior science and engineering capabilities.''   ``Maintaining that lead will require us to change our thinkingand approach in some key areas. We cannot legislate this change,but we may have to change the legislation to achieve our goals,''Bingaman said.   The Pentagon now spends about $9 billion a year on a variety oftechnology programs, including research, exploratory developmentand advanced demonstration.   The laboratories where some of the research is conducted aregovernment-owned, and ``there has been a continuing and, in recentyears, rising concern that they are inefficient, ineffective,self-serving and duplicative of industry work, and increasinglyhampered in doing their jobs by the conditions of being part of thegovernment,'' the report said.   Specifically, the report found it takes the Pentagon longer totranslate lab advances in the laboratory into fielded militarysystems. That conclusion echoes previous findings by other studiesof how the Pentagon builds weapons.   The report also found that a large amount of technology oftencomes from industries that sell to both military and civiliancustomers.   In many instances, these ``dual-use industries'' areinternational, a situation that creates tough competition for U.S.companies and makes the United States more dependent on foreignsupplies, the study found.   ``U.S. leadership in high-technology industries that are vitalto defense is eroding in the face of strong internationalcompetition,'' the report said.   Another problem is the myriad of government rules and lawslimiting the ability of the Pentagon to develop technology, thereport said. Congress enacted the laws to prevent abuses, but thevast number have made the technology system ``slow, cumbersome andinefficient.''   Congress should decide if the office of the secretary of defenseshould have greater oversight of the technology programs, orwhether the services should act independently, the report said.   In a related development, a study by the Center for Strategicand International Studies released Monday found that almost 100,000companies stopped doing business with the Pentagon over a five-yearperiod despite an increase in the defense budget.   The report found that in 1982, more than 138,000 companiesprovided goods to the Defense Department. But by 1987, the numberdropped to less than 40,000.   ``Some of the 80,000 went out of business, including about20,000 small businesses,'' the report said. ``Most of the 80,000firms, however, simply quit doing business with the DefenseDepartment and opted for other customers.''   The report described the drop-off as ``remarkable'' in light ofthe increase in the defense procurement budget from $54.9 billionto $87 billion in constant fiscal 1989 dollars.   The study attributed the decline to predatory pricing tacticsused by the larger companies. In some instances, those companieslowered prices below marginal costs, making it impossible for thesmaller companies to compete.   In addition, the report found that in comparison to otherindustries, ``defense is not a highly profitable business.''   CSIS is a private, non-profit think tank which issues studies ona variety of national security issues.</TEXT></DOC>
