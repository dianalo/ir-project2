Ithas many advantages over traditional fossil fuels, especially when usedfor heating. The most striking benefits are the fact that when burnedit does not pollute the atmosphere and that it is safe to use. The onlyeconomical way of transporting natural gas is through a pipeline. Longpipelines are very expensive to build. Furthermore, once the pipelineis built and branch lines set up, the only way of recovering those costsis if the number potential customers is large. Finland receives its supplyof natural gas from the Western-Siberian gas field about 4000 kilometresfrom Finland. It is said that this field produces the world's cleanestnatural gas that is also of a consistent quality.</TEXT></DOC>
