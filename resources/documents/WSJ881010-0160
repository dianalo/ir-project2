Clifton E. Haley, Budget president, said the company's directors think the market price of Budget's stock &quot;does not adequately reflect Budget's true value.&quot; He said the decision to study a possible sale of the third-largest car-rental company wasn't triggered by the receipt of any takeover or merger queries.    Mr. Haley added that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has been retained to advise Budget management relating to the sale.    Budget could sell for $15 to $20 a share, or $167 million to $222 million, based on 11.1 million common shares outstanding, said Charles Finnie, a securities analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore. The company may be worth as much as $24 a share, or $266.4 million, to an auto company that could then use the rental company as its largest &quot;captive&quot; customer, Mr. Finnie said.    Following Friday morning's announcement of the possible sale, Budget's stock gained $2.625 to close at $14.25 in national over-the-counter trading. Budget went public in May 1987, with 3.2 million shares offered at $14 a share. In late 1986, an investment group led by the New York investment-banking firm of Gibbons, Green, Van Amerongen Ltd., and including Budget's top officers, bought the company from Transamerica Corp. for $205 million, plus the assumption of some $296 million of Budget debt.    Gibbons Green currently owns more than 50% of Budget's common shares outstanding, and Budget management as a group own about 10%.    Neither Gibbons Green officials nor Mr. Haley would comment on what they estimated was an appropriate value for the company. </TEXT></DOC>
