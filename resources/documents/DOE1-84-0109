Details aregiven on small-scale electric heat pumps for water and space heatingpurposes, electric cold and hot water generators, electric heat pumpsfor steam generation, small-scale gas absorption heat pumps, and gasengine heat pumps (gas engines equipped with heat exchanger, compressor,evaporator and condenser). Reference is made to both the number and theoverall capacity of dual-purpose power plants in the Federal Republicof Germany (300 plants; 180 MW electric power output, 285 MW installedthermal power). Further remarks are dedicated to catalytic convertersreducing pollutant emissions. The paper concludes with details on solarwater heating. Presently lower energy prices are found to be impedingthe marketability of innovative, environmentally compatible systems knownto considerably contribute to energy conservation. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
