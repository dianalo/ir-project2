 This powerful deskside system replaces the MicroVAX3400 computer and uses new CPU technology for double the performance at thesame price;andM;o  Enhanced datacenter solutions for the VAX 6000 line.andP;  These include newlow-priced storage subsystems, resulting in lower system prices; dual-hostconfigurations that provide high availability at lower prices than waspreviously available; ULTRIX support for the VAX 6000 Model 500; andDigital's intention to deliver a high-performance Fiber Distributed DataInterface (FDDI) adapter for high-speed communications; andandM;o  New DSSI storage products for VAX systems, including a DSSI-to-XMI diskand tape adapter, Storage Array subsystems, a new competitively priced1-Gbyte 5.25-inch disk, and a new Tape subsystem that provides 2 Gbytes ofunattended back-up.andM;NEW LOW-END VAX 4000 MODEL 200 The VAX 4000 Model 200 uses the sameDigital-developed RISC I/O technology as the VAX 4000 Model 300, delivering800 I/Os per second.andP;  It is ideal as a server or as a timesharing system fordistributed transaction processing.andP;  The system also is available in dualhost configurations for production systems applications such as banking,process manufacturing, and others that require low system downtime and highapplication availability.andM;VAX 4000 Model 200 versions are available in the following configurations: timesharing, server, dual host for high availability applications, realtime,and standard, 19-inch-wide rackmount configurations for space savings.andM;Digital is targeting the Model 200 in the $25,000 - $75,000 price range foruse in departments, branch offices, and warehouses.andP;  Digital is alsorecruiting resellers to sell the systems to small businesses with sales ofless than $250 million.andM;For distributed transaction processing applications, the system achieves 13transactions per second (TPS).andP;  It is positioned with the HP 3000 Model 932or IBM AS/400 Model B50.andP;  However, the base price of the VAX 4000 Model 200is significantly lower than that of the HP or IBM systems.andM;&quot;For server applications, the VAXserver 4000 Model 200, with its base priceof $20,000, mainframe-class I/O, and superior desktop integration software,competes favorably with Sun's Sparcserver systems and Compaq's System Pro 486series of computers,&quot; said Duncan Anderson, marketing manager for EntryBusiness Systems at Digital.andM;ENHANCED VAX 6000 DATACENTER SOLUTIONS Digital is now making majorprice/performance enhancements to the VAX 6000 series based on the additionof low-priced DSSI storage products.andP;  VAX 6000 systems that incorporateindustry-leading DSSI storage arrays provide high-performance I/Ocapabilities at lower system prices than were previously available.andP;  Forexample, price/performance has been improved by 15 to 20 percent for criticaldatacenter applications such as transaction processing.andM;VAX 6000 systems now support dual host VAXcluster systems based on DSSIstorage technology to complement CI VAXcluster systems.andP;  Clustering one VAX6000 system with another provides double the throughput of a single systemand a high-availability solution at a lower price than was previouslyavailable.andM;Preconfigured VAX 6000 systems based on DSSI technology are availableimmediately, with prices starting at $139,000.andP;  Preconfigured dual hostsystems also are available now, with prices starting at $448,000.andP;  Digital isalso offering several new VAX 6000 preconfigured systems designed for keycustomer datacenter applications, available immediately.andP;  These include Rdbdatabase/TP servers, third-party database/TP servers, database/TP developmentsystems, software development systems, and vector compute servers.andM;FDDI Digital is announcing its intention to connect the XMI (the VAX 6000system bus and VAX 9000 I/O bus) directly to the Fiber Distributed DataInterface (FDDI), an open networking standard with high-speed 100megabit-per-second I/O.andP;  Planned for availability this spring, FDDInetworking will greatly enhance the performance of transaction processing andimaging applications.andM;To further enhance the openness of VAX systems, Digital announced fullsupport for both the VMS and ULTRIX operating systems on all VAX 6000computers, including the VAX 6000 Model 500.andP;  VAX 6000 Model 500 systemsrunning ULTRIX Version 4.1 are available immediately with prices starting at$204,000.andM;The VAX 6000 platform strategy ensures that all 10,000-plus existing VAX 6000systems can take advantage of these enhancements to provide solutions forcritical datacenter applications.andM;STORAGE PRODUCTS FOR VAX COMPUTERS DSSI storage technology now allowscustomers to configure dual-host VAX 6000 systems, resulting in a 40-percentimprovement in storage price/performance, and the high availability andincreased performance of VAXcluster systems.andP;  According to Tom Burniece,Manager of Storage Systems Group, &quot;The new DSSI storage options providebalanced storage solutions for VAX 6000 systems, and the foundation forcost-effective, entry-level dual host VAXcluster systems.&quot;andM;The new storage products, which extend support of DSSI Storage Technology toVAX 6000 systems, include:andM;o  The new KFMSA disk and tape adapter, a single module connecting DSSI tothe XMI bus of the VAX 6000 systems.andP;  It supports up to 14 integrated storageelements (ISE), two of which can be tapes, and is priced at $14,000.andM;o  The new SF200 Storage Array, which can be configured with up to 24 GB ofdisk capacity and up to two TF837 tape subsystems in a single cabinet thatoccupies only 5 square feet of floor space.andP;  The new SF200 Storage ArraySubsystem offers a 75 percent savings in valuable floor space over previousconfiguration options.andP;  Pricing starts at $33,000.andM;o  The new TF837 tape subsystem, first in a family of tape backup subsystemsproviding 2 GB of unattended backup in a single 8-hour shift.andP;  It can beeasily upgraded to future members of the family for higher capacity andperformance, and is priced at $18,000.andM;o  The new SF72 Storage Array building block for SF200 Storage ArraySubsystems.andP;  It provides 2 or 4 GB of incremental disk capacity.andP;  Pricingstarts at $26,000.andM;o  The new RF72 1 GB 5.25-inch DSSI disk.andP;  It provides high-end disk featuresat a very competitive price of $13,000 and is the foundation for the new DSSIStorage Arrays.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
