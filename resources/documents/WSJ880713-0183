They say many arrive with forged documents in an effort to support their claims for political asylum.    &quot;A few hundred Chileans a year came to Sweden at the beginning of the 1980s,&quot; Mats Baurmann, a Swedish immigration official, said. &quot;Last year, 4,000 applied for political asylum. Most of them came for economic reasons.&quot;    Economic reasons aren't enough for an alien to stay in Sweden or Norway, where officials are concerned that their liberal refugee policies are being abused.    The problem also involves nationalities other than Chileans, but it is particularly acute among Chileans wanting to join the 17,000 other Chileans who immigrated as long ago as 1973, when Gen. Augusto Pinochet took power at the head of a military government in Santiago.    About 18,000 people applied for asylum in Sweden last year. About 14,000 were accepted, but most of their applications had been pending for at least a year. Sweden had a total of 37,000 immigrants in 1987, the goverment's Immigration Agency said.    The Swedish government is said to be considering tightening its immigration laws, similar to legislation adopted by Norway in June requiring all visiting Chileans, starting July 1, to obtain entry visas in advance of arrival.    Norwegian officials, rejecting claims that their move reflected a wave of anti-immigration sentiment among voters, said they wanted only to sift out political refugees from the growing tide of people seeking to improve their economic well-being.    Annette Thomessen, head of the Norwegian Organization for Asylum Seekers, said in Oslo that she supported the new regulations.    She claimed that some travel agents in Chile promise jobs and housing to those who buy tickets to Norway. &quot;But when they arrive here, they get nothing,&quot; she said. &quot;Instead, they are sent back, deeply in debt.&quot;    Neighboring Denmark, which also has a relaxed immigration policy, has registered no significant increase of requests for asylum from Chileans, a Justice Ministry spokesman in Cophenhagen said.    Mr. Baurmann, the Swedish official, said most of the Chilean applicants come from poor areas of their country. They borrow from banks or from relatives to pay for the return ticket, which they need to enter Sweden without a visa, he said.    &quot;They arrive saying they are tourists, but after a while they apply for political asylum,&quot; Mr. Baurmann said.    He confirmed Swedish press reports that a would-be immigrant can buy a forged document in Chile that testifies that he or she is a victim of political persecution. The documents usually bear the signature of a purported priest, politician or human rights representative, he said.    The Dagens Nyheter newspaper quoted Luis Bork, head of the Human Rights Commission in the Chilean city of Valparaiso, as saying: &quot;I have seen my name on more than 200 forged documents. We categorically oppose this kind of exile. People should stay here and fight for democracy. Only if the person is threatened by jail or death do we help.&quot;    Mr. Baurmann said most documents presented by Chileans are authentic but are signed by people without authority or credibility.    Swedish authorities &quot;do not deny that there is political oppression in Chile,&quot; but Sweden's rules must be tightened, he said.    About 65% of the Chileans coming to Sweden are allowed to stay, even though many are rejected for asylum, he said.    Processing an application can take as long as two years, while living expenses are paid by the government. Even if an applicant is denied asylum, &quot;Many of them get rooted in Sweden&quot; and eventually are allowed to stay, Mr. Baurmann said.    Anita Doratio, head of the Swedish Organizations for Asylum Seekers, told the national radio that it would be &quot;cynical&quot; to tighten the rules. She argued that Swedes weren't turned away when poverty forced one million of them to emigrate to the U.S. 100 years ago. </TEXT></DOC>
