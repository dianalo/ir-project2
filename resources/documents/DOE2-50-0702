Chapter threedeals with the preparation and degradation of 6-[{sup 13}C]sorbic acidin order to find evidence for, or against, the mechanism proposed inchapter two. It also gives details of syntheses attempted in order toobtain 6- [{sup 13}C]sorbic acid. The interaction of sorbic acid andsulfur dioxide in real food systems is the subject of the fourth chapter.The food systems studied were mayonnaise, tomato puree, orange juiceand cottage cheese. The effect of packaging on the rate of degradationof sorbic acid was also investigated. The final chapter deals with amicrobiological study of two homologues of sorbic acid, 2,4-heptadienoicacid, 2,4-octadienoic acid. The fungicidal activity of these two compounds,towards selected fungi, was analyzed. 4-Oxobut-2-enoic acid, a degradationproduct of sorbic acid in aqueous systems, was also analyzed as a possiblefungistat.</TEXT></DOC>
