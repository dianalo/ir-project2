This is due to thepotential advantages of continuous processes. These include an increasein labour efficiency, a decrease in specific energy consumption, andthe production of a more homogeneous product. Fused silica is difficultto produce continuously because of its high viscosity even hundreds ofdegrees above its melting point. In industry, silica is currently fusedby both processes which are inefficient in terms of furnace utilizationand labour efficiency. In this paper, a three-phase 50 Kw alternatingcurrent arc furnace was developed and tested for the continuous productionof fused silica. The fusion mechanisms were studied for both batch andcontinuous melting. Also, the physical and chemical properties of theproducts were compared. In addition, the energy requirements were determinedfor the two melting techniques and for two different electrode configurations.In the commerical process for fused silica production, the single phasefurnace (500 KVA) operates at about 480 volts and 1000 amps. Generally1000 kg of sand are fused in a three hour cycle. Thus, a typical energyconsumption value would be about 1.44 KwH per kg of fused silica. Inthe present continuous tests the feed rate was approximately 80 kg/minand the energy comsumption was about 4.69 KwH per kg of fused silica.It would be expected that the energy requirements for the continuousprocess would be expected that the energy requirements for the continuousprocess would be higher because an open arc is employed. However, sincethe continuously extracted product has much smaller dimensions than thecommerical ingot, the energy requirements for crushing and grinding wouldbe reduced. In addition, a more efficient operation would be expectedas the furnace size increases. 1 ref., 7 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
