U.S. officials have said the agency's participation insuch a project -- a consortium of the Japanese government andprivate companies -- would breach Japan's 1990 commitment totreat domestic and foreign suppliers of commercial satellitesfairly and impartially. After a complaint by the U.S. TradeRepresentative's Office, Japan's Ministry of Post andTelecommunications yesterday said it would support thefacility only as long as it isn't used to test commercialsatellites.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. officials weren't aware of the ministry's interest inthe facility, called the Space Chamber International, untilthey learned of it Sept. 4 in the business daily Nihon KeizaiShimbun. &quot;We were dismayed and disturbed by the pressreport,&quot; a senior U.S. official said. &quot;We communicated withTokyo, and {obtained} an understanding that the plan waswithdrawn.&quot;   A spokesman for the telecommunications ministry said theministry will continue to seek $15 million in funds for thespace chamber. However, the ministry generally won't allowthe chamber to be used for purposes other than testingcommunity antenna television, or CATV, systems, anddata-transmission equipment, the spokesman said.   The ministry acknowledged that the facility could be usedfor testing Japanese-designed satellites if they are intendedexclusively for research purposes. The 1990 bilateralagreement proscribing the ministry's buy-Japanese policiesmakes an exception for research satellites.</TEXT></DOC>
