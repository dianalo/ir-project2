Chief Federal Prosecutor Kurt Rebmann said the charges againstformer Army Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad involved an ``especially gravecase'' of supplying American and NATO defense secrets to theSoviets through the spy ring.   The most recent delivery took place last month in Vienna,Rebmann said.   ``We can't exclude the possibility that millions of dollars areinvolved'' in the case, said Alexander Prechtel, a spokesman forRebmann. He said it was too soon to say exacly what damage was doneto NATO.   The U.S. State Department said in a statement in Washington,``We understand that there has been an apprehension by West Germanauthorities, but do not consider it appropriate to comment at thistime.''   But FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich said: ``This is a verysignificant matter. The interest to this country is acute. It is amatter of intense interest to the FBI.''   Authorities in Sweden said today they have detained twoHungarian-born brothers who confessed to working for the Hungariansecret service and who apparently were members of an internationalspy ring.   Sven-Olof Hakansson, chief prosecutor of the Goteborg district,said the men, both physicians who immigrated in the 1960s, weredetained on Tuesday with radios and coded messages.   ``We have worked in cooperation with German police because itwas very important to arrest these people at the same time so theycould not warn each other,'' said Torsten Bjorkhede, chief of theSwedish security police.   Prechtel said the arrested Swedes were suspected of being partof the same ring, which he said was based in West Germany and usedcouriers from Sweden.   Hakansson said the suspected spies had traveled several times toWest Germany.   Prechtel, said in a telephone interview that he couldn't ruleout the possibility the charge of espionage against Conrad might beraised to treason. The spokesman said Conrad was ``the head'' ofthe ring.   Prechtel said Conrad was from Ohio, but he could not provide thehometown.   The statement came after The New York Times reported today thatSwedish and West German authorities had arrested eight peopleinvolved in a spy ring that supplied secret military documents tothe Soviets for at least 10 years.   Prechtel, speaking from his office in the city of Karlsruhe,confirmed virtually all of the Times report on the case.   He confirmed that documents concerning North Atlantic TreatyOrganization defense plans for Europe were believed stolen as wellas the U.S. Army contingency plans for a ground war in Europeagainst the Soviet Union.   But he emphasized that officials were still conducting in-depthinvestigations to determine exactly what was missing.   Prechtel said that while ``several'' people had been taken intocustody or arrested, he could not confirm that the number was eight.   The ring was based in West Germany, while couriers were based inneutral Sweden, the spokesman also confirmed.   Rebmann said Conrad sold secret documents to ``a Soviet blocsecret service.''   Conrad has been sent to investigative detention following hisappearance before a special panel of the West German Supreme Court,Rebmann's office said.   Rebmann's statement said that Conrad had worked for the U.S.military for 20 years before his discharge in 1985. It said he wasborn in 1947, but did not give his hometown in the United States.   Principals in the newly uncovered ring, which operated through aGerman-Hungarian connection, caused a major security loss to theUnited States, according to the Times report, later confirmed byRebmann.   The report said investigators believe the spy ring providedAmerican, West German and NATO secrets to the Hungarianintelligence agency. The Hungarians then shared the secrets withthe Soviet Union, officials told the Times.   The Times said the network was uncovered by West German and U.S.officials, including agents from the FBI and the Army. The Army hasabout 250,000 military personnel in West Germany at more than 200installations.   Rebmann's written statement said the charge against Conrad was``compelling suspicion of espionage activities in an especiallygrave case.''   The statement said that in the seven years before his 1985discharge, Conrad had access to military defense plans at a U.S.base in the West German city of Bad Kreuznach.   ``The accused is under compelling suspicion of having deliveredthese documents to a Soviet Bloc secret service by means of acommand officer and couriers living abroad in return for highpayment,'' the statement said.</TEXT></DOC>
