These are not toll-free numbers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Under section 4219(c) of the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA''), the PensionBenefit Guaranty Corporation (``the PBGC'') promulgated a final regulationon Notice and Collection of Withdrawal Liability. That regulation, codifiedat 29 CFR Part 2644, deals with the rate of interest to be charged by multiemployerpension plans on withdrawal liability payments that are overdue or in default,or to be credited by plans on overpayments of withdrawal liability. Theregulation allows plans to set rates, subject to certain restrictions.Where a plan does not set the interest rate, andSection; 2644.3(b) of theregulation provides that the rate to be charged or credited for any calendarquarter is the average quoted prime rate on short-term commercial loansfor the fifteenth day (or the next business day if the fifteenth day isnot a business day) of the month preceding the beginning of the quarter,as reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System inStatistical Release H.15 (``Selected Interest Rates'').Because the regulation incorporates interest rates published in StatisticalRelease H.15, that release is the authoritative source for the rates thatare to be applied under the regulation. As a convenience to persons usingthe regulation, however, the PBGC collects the applicable rates and republishesthem in an appendix to Part 2644. This amendment adds to this appendixthe interest rate of 11\1/2\ percent, which will be effective from April1, 1989 through June 30, 1989. This rate represents an increase of 1 percentfrom the rate in effect for the first quarter of 1989. See 53 FR 52995(December 30, 1988). This rate is based on the prime rate in effect onMarch 15, 1989.The appendix to 29 CFR Part 2644 does not prescribe interest rates underthe regulation; the rates prescribed in the regulation are those publishedin Statistical Release H.15. The appendix merely collects and republishesthe rates in a convenient place. Thus, the interest rates in the appendixare informational only. Accordingly, the PBGC finds that notice of andpublic comment on this amendment would be unnecessary and contrary to thepublic interest. For the above reasons, the PBGC also believes that goodcause exists for making this amendment effective immediately.The PBGC has determined that this amendment is not a ``major rule'' withinthe meaning of Executive Order 12291, because it will not have an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more; nor create a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, or geographicregions, nor have significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, innovation or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Because no general notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this amendment,the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply.
