In the clubby worldof international finance, you can dine out the rest of yourcareer after being a &quot;sherpa,&quot; one of the aides who decide inadvance what the industrial world's heads of government getto talk about. So there's not much point proposing any newsubject for Houston along with agricultural subsidies, aid tothe Soviet Union and the rest.   There is a broader and more philosophical issue, though,that the presidents and prime ministers might set the sherpasworking on for some future meeting. Quite simply, what's gonewrong with economic growth throughout the world?</LP><TEXT>   President Bush, Chancellor Kohl, Prime Minster Kaifu andthe rest preside at a most hopeful moment. There is peace, byworld standards, with the threat of war receding. The greatinflations of the 1970s have been subdued. The technologicalpossibilities are stupendous, promising a new industrialrevolution. And yet, growth is grudging at best. Despitepassing bright spots, the world has not been able to recoverthe growth rates it enjoyed from the end of World War IIuntil 1973.   This was brilliantly documented by Angus Maddison in animpressive study for the OECD, &quot;The World Economy in the 20thCentury.&quot; He compared average compound growth rates between1950 and 1973 with growth rates between 1973 and 1987. U.S.growth fell to 2.5% from 3.7%. But Japanese growth fell to3.7% from 9.3%. In 16 OECD countries it fell to 2.4% from4.9%.   Similar declines were recorded throughout the world: inLatin America, the Middle East, the Soviet Union, EasternEurope. Asia, aside from Japan, was the sole exception, andmay have joined the crowd with the evident economic plunge inChina after the events of 1989. In some regions, growth inthe 1973-1987 period fell behind the increase in population,so that GDP per capita actually declined -- by 0.3% a year inLatin America, 0.8% in the Middle East and 0.9% in Africa.   The question the sherpas ought to study, in short, is&quot;Whatever happened in 1973?&quot;   Everyone remembers that 1973 was the year of the Arab oilembargo and sudden increases in energy costs. As Prof.Maddison says, &quot;The suddenness of the slowdown points up therole of external shocks,&quot; the oil price explosion and theLatin American debt crisis. But he sagely adds, &quot;the shocksare far from the whole story.&quot;   He identifies two more reasons for the slowdown. One is achange in growth potential, since the pre-1973 periodincludes recovery from World War II. Against the growth ratesof 1900 to 1950, what looks unusual is not the slow growthafter 1973 but the rapid growth in 1950-1973.   Prof. Maddison's third reason for the post 1973 slowdownwas the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange-rate system.&quot;This removed the monetary pillar of the postwarinternational order,&quot; he writes. &quot;Henceforth there was anon-system,&quot; with the U.S., U.K. and Japan favoring floatingexchange rates and Germany and France seeking &quot;an island ofstability&quot; with the European Monetary System.   My argument is that the final collapse of Bretton Woodswas the decisive event of 1973. With the technologicalopportunities before us, the world economy should not besatisfied with the growth rates of 1900-1950, a period thatincluded two world wars and the Great Depression. The oilshocks were dramatic and painful, and no doubt amplified thebasic problem. But they were only an artifact of theunderlying monetary disorder.   The collapse of Bretton Woods was a gradual process,measured by the dissolution of the London gold pool in March1968, the closing of the U.S. gold window in August 1971 andfinally the advent of generalized floating rates in March1973, a few months before the Arab oil embargo. To strip awaythe caveats, the breakup of Bretton Woods caused the oilcrisis. Many observers will find this an extraordinaryassertion; what is the evidence for it? For one thing, OPECtold us so, and in advance.   Five weeks after the closing of the gold window, the OPECconference convened an extraordinary meeting in Beirut andissued Resolution XXV.140:                                                                                                          The Conference, having considered the report of theSecretary General concerning the recent internationalmonetary developments and their adverse effect on thepurchasing power of the oil revenue of Member Countries;noting that these developments have resulted in a de factodevaluation of the United States dollar, the currency inwhich posted prices are established, vis-a-vis the currenciesof the major industrialized countries; recalling ResolutionXXI.122 which calls, inter alia, for adjustment in posted ortax-reference prices so as to offset any adverse effectresulting from de facto or de jure changes in the parity ofmonies of major industrialized countries; resolves 1. thatMember Countries shall take necessary action and/or shallestablish negotiations, individually or in groups, with theoil companies with a view to adopting ways and means tooffset any adverse effects on the per barrel real income ofMember Countries resulting from the international monetarydevelopments as of 15th August, 1971. 2. that the results ofnegotiations shall be submitted to the next Conference. Incase such negotiations fail to achieve their purpose, theConference shall determine such action as necessary for theimplementation of this Resolution.                                                                                                          At this same meeting, the OPEC nations moved to takedirect interests in the oil concessions previously owned byforeign companies. In reporting these actions at the time,this newspaper remarked: &quot;Several oil sources said theyregard the new OPEC demands as breaking the agreements signedlast spring, which supposedly fixed financial terms onforeign oil production for the next five years. At the time,the oil companies had hailed the agreements as guaranteeing asemblance of stability in oil prices to consumers despite theagreed increases.&quot; As events unfolded, the OPEC resolution's&quot;such action as necessary&quot; became known as the &quot;energycrisis.&quot;   For perspective on this issue, though, I once asked thehelpful folks at Cyrus J. Lawrence to program up the price ofoil in terms of gold. At the historic price of $35 gold and$2.75 oil, an ounce of gold bought 12.73 barrels of oil. Thisratio prevailed so long as the London Gold pool lasted. In1969, the price of gold started to creep up, and an ounce ofgold would command 13 barrels of oil. In 1972, it would buy16 barrels of oil. By the eve of the Arab oil embargo in1973, an ounce of gold commanded 26 barrels of oil. After theembargo, in the first half of 1974, an ounce of gold wasworth 12.76 barrels of oil.   Only for a brief period -- from mid-1975 to the end of1977 -- did OPEC push up the price of oil fast enough toimprove its value in gold. The oil/gold ratio touched 8.84barrels an ounce in the second half of 1976. By 1986, withthe collapse of the cartel, an ounce of gold was worth 33barrels of oil.   Readers can attach their own caveats to this, but surelyit suggests that the sudden emergence of OPEC was not thedriving force in the post-1973 economy. There was no goldcartel, yet by and large the nominal prices of gold and oilmoved in tandem. While the parallel movement was not perfect,it certainly does not look like a coincidence. There musthave been some more fundamental underlying force.   This force was the explosion of international monetaryreserves during and after the collapse of Bretton Woods. Thisis not well understood by economists thinking in terms ofclosed national economies, but was quickly understood byinternational economists, who see the world as one integratedsystem. Prof. Robert Triffin, for example, linkedinternational reserves and the oil crisis as early as 1975.In papers delivered that year at the American EnterpriseInstitute and elsewhere, he wrote that international reservesincreased by 168% from January 1, 1970, through Sept. 30,1974. He added:   &quot;This fantastic expansion well preceded the oil priceexplosion of the fall of 1973 and fueled the world-wideinflation of which oil prices are only one -- and not themajor -- of the components. World reserves had already morethan doubled over the years 1970, 1971 and 1972, increasingin this short span of three years by more than in allprevious years and centuries since Adam and Eve. If such aprocess were not arrested -- and it has not been so far -- itwould continue to fuel world inflation even if the energyproblem could be solved tomorrow.&quot;   Similarly, another great international economist, Prof.Robert Mundell, wrote in this newspaper on Jan. 31, 1983,which also happened to be the inaugural issue of The WallStreet Journal/Europe:   &quot;The oil price increases of the 1970s would not have beenpossible without the accompanying rise in the price of gold(hence gold reserves) and foreign exchange holdings. Afterthe price of oil was raised industrial countries and the LDCsfaced the prospect of deficits which would have meant eitherdeflation or depreciation of their currencies against thedollar, had the U.S. not provided the reserves upon which theEurodollar market could expand to finance the oil deficits inthe great lending spree of 1973-81.&quot;   The reserve explosion continued because generalizedfloating rates lacked any external discipline, Prof. Mundelladded. In one month of 1982, more international liquidity wasadded than in all the years prior to the 1971 closing of thegold window. &quot;Balance-of-payments discipline under a fixedexchange rate system was replaced eventually by the barrierof fiscal discipline, reached after a once-for-all explosionof lending exhausted government credit.&quot;   Ultimately, an impending collapse led to the appointmentof Paul Volcker as Federal Reserve chairman in 1979.Inflation was wrung out of the system at great cost,especially to developing nations still straining under a debtload assumed when both borrower and lender assumed furtherrapid erosion of the dollar. A world recession seemedimminent, but was averted with recovery starting in the U.S.in 1983, which was also the year of the first effective ratereductions under the Reagan tax program. We are nonethelessleft with inflation above Bretton Woods norms, and theslowdown in secular growth documented by Prof. Maddison.   Precisely how would the collapse of Bretton Woods slowgrowth? First and most obvious, the inflationary experienceof 1973-1980 and its subsequent correction would be noeconomists' prescription for growth. Also, the floating-rateregime with free capital movement, Prof. Maddison comments,forced government policy makers to become more cautious:&quot;Full employment was no longer an objective of policy,economic growth had become a secondary goal. The toppriorities were to stop inflation and avoid paymentsdeficits.&quot; (In this new orthodoxy, he adds, &quot;The UnitedStates has been an important deviant, with policy actionwhich has been a quixotic version of the old Keynesianmode.&quot;)   I would submit, though, that there is an even morefundamental reason why the present international monetaryregime retards world growth from its potential. To unite thethemes I have been striking, in a one-world economy,exchange-rate movements thwart Adam Smith's invisible hand.   All of Adam Smith's great perceptions depend on accuratetransmission of prices. The division of labor, for example,depends on the trade-off between the product of one man'slabor and the product of another's. To achieve an efficientresult, however, their output has to be measured by theyardstick of common prices. If there are two yardsticks, andtheir lengths keep changing, labor will not flow to its bestuse.   We once imagined that floating exchange rates would merelyiron out differences in inflation and other extraneousinfluences, and allow the accurate transmission of realprices throughout an integrated world economy. But that hasnot been our experience.   Between the middle of 1985 and the end of 1987, both theyen and the mark doubled in value against the dollar: inround terms, from 240 yen to 120 and from three marks to 1.5.This was, of course, without a hyperinflation or depressionin the American economy. There is simply nothing in theeconomic fundamentals to explain a 100% change in 2 1/2years. The same can be said of exchange-rate volatilitymeasured on a monthly or even daily basis.   What's more, exchange rates obviously overshoot purchasingpower parity in both directions. Purchasing power parity,when exchange rates do not affect the buying power of a givenamount of money, is presumably an indicator of long-runequilibrium. The 1989 estimate of PPP by Prof. Ron McKinnon,the leading proponent of the idea, is 1.9 to 2.1 marks and155 to 175 yen. At the time of the Plaza meeting in September1985, the dollar was obviously overvalued against PPP; inmost of 1988 it was undervalued. This produces disequilibriumin the various economies, for example pressure towardinflation and deflation through the international arbitrageof goods.   From the point of view of the individual firm, such swingsare certain to swamp the profit margins in cross-bordertransactions. From a macroeconomic point of view, similarly,they are going to swamp such concepts as the division oflabor, comparative advantage and Pareto optimality. That is,they distort the exchange of goods and services, and destroythe efficiencies Adam Smith saw in free exchange.   The pull of an integrated world economy is so powerfulthat individual firms find it worthwhile to find ways aroundthe swings of exchange rates. They can, for example, set upplants in each of the three major currency areas, and shiftproduction from one to another depending on exchange rates.Politically, the seesaw adjustments implicit in this kind ofscheme are a breeding ground for protectionism among affectedsuppliers, workers and communities. Economically, they are awaste of capital and a drain on efficiency. The firms mayadjust, but the economy will produce sub-optimum growth ofthe kind recorded in Prof. Maddision's numbers.   It should scarcely be a surprise, then, that the BrettonWoods period goes down as a &quot;golden era&quot; in world economicgrowth. Come to think of it, the previous golden eraapparently took place during the gold-standard years prior toWorld War I. And today, with instant world-wide communicationand 24-hour financial markets, it is surely more disruptivethan ever to try to run one integrated economy with multiplecurrencies.   This is not the place to discuss the economictechnicalities or political difficulties of constructing anew international monetary order. But let me suggest a fewthings:   A new fixed-rate regime, albeit with very wide bands, isalready implicit in the G-5 and G-7 agreements at the Plazaand Louvre meetings; I regard it a major failing that theU.S. refused to accept even the minimum financial disciplineof the Louvre parities, allowing the dollar to sink belowthem. The evolution of the European Monetary System isproviding much valuable experience; perhaps Britain wouldhave found it easier to join a world-wide system than astrictly European one. In the U.S. there is a buddingrecognition that, whether or not a lower dollar helps thebalance of trade, it provides a bargain sale of U.S. assets.And finally, if governments worry about the loss ofsovereignty, episodes like France's abandonment of theMitterrand economic policies or the U.S. abandonment of&quot;benign neglect&quot; of the dollar leave one to wonder how muchsovereignty they have left to lose.   A great deal of progress, it seems to me, would resultfrom the adoption of one seemingly simple principle. Theobjective of an international monetary order is not tobalance the flow of goods and services among differentregions of the world economy. It is not to liberatepoliticians in individual regions from the disciplines of themarketplace. Rather, the purpose of an international monetaryorder is to provide accurate transmission of price signalsacross arbitrary borders, to let Adam Smith's invisible handwork throughout an increasingly integrated world economy.   ---   Mr. Bartley is editor of the Journal.
