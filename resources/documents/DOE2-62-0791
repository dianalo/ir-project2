The variation and behaviour of selected lowfrequencies during fault conditions are herein presented. These are contrastedto normal events such as feeder switching and capacitor bank operations.Recorded field data has been analyzed and is statistically presentedin the paper. Specific behaviour characteristics such as arc duration,arc repetition rate, and magnitude of low frequency spectra are presented.Comparisons are made for different soil types and conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
