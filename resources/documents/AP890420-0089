Helicopters brought ashore the bodies of those killed inWednesday's explosion inside a gun turret aboard the USS Iowa asthe huge battleship anchored offshore. Then, after a briefceremony, a plane bearing the bodies took off for a militarymortuary in Dower, Del., and the ship left for its home port ofNorfolk, Va.   The Pentagon today put the death toll at 47 and said other crewmembers were accounted for. Earlier, spokesmen had said the deathtoll could be higher.   Ten to 12 crew members, most of them firefighters, sufferedminor injuries. They were treated aboard ship and were back at worktoday, the Navy said.   A blue Navy van carrying the coffins to the airstrip were met byspecial honor and color guards bearing the U.S., Navy and U.S.Marine Corps flags. The guards saluted each coffin as eight sailorsacting as pallbearers placed them in the cavernous belly of acamouflaged, C-5 Galaxy cargo plane.   The cargo doors closed at 11:30 a.m. EDT and the plane began itslong flight to Dover.   Some 100 reporters and photographers who had been allowed insidethe base for a press conference and to watch the boarding ceremonywere then told to leave and were not allowed back in.   The blast occurred during a gunnery exercise while the46-year-old ship was on maneuvers about 330 miles northeast ofPuerto Rico.   The explosion and fire were in the second of the two forwardturrets, at the loading position of the center gun in the three-gunturret, said Bruce Nason, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon.   Eleven crewmen inside the turret escaped, from a magazine areaat the bottom of the seven-story-high turret, said Vice Adm. JeromeJohnson, commander of the U.S. 2nd Fleet, who was aboard the Iowa.   ``I can tell you the fire and explosion was instantaneous.Because it was instantaneous, we have no other injuries,'' Johnsontold reporters at a Roosevelt Roads news conference this morning.   The ship's captain decided to remain 10 to 15 miles out to seabecause the Iowa draws 36 to 38 feet of water and the RooseveltRoads harbor is only 40 feet deep, said Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, aNavy spokesman. He said the ship would head for its home port inNorfolk, Va., after all bodies were brought ashore.   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said an investigation of theincident has already begun and will be led by Rear Adm. Richard D.Milligan, commander of Cruiser Destroyer Group 2 and a formercommanding officer of the battleship USS New Jersey.   In Norfolk, about 200 relatives of the 1,600 crewmen aboard theIowa spent the night at a Norfolk Naval Station gym out of sight ofreporters. Military policy requires that families of dead orinjured personnel be notified before their names are released.   ``There are those who are really struggling, and those who arereally stoic,''said Navy Chaplain Barry Brimhall. ``Right now, forsome of these families, they would rather have bad news than nonews at all.''   In Temple, Texas, Lorene Barron said all she could do was prayfor her son, Monte Barron, and hope she would hear from the Navy bytelephone.   ``They told me if he was among the deceased, they wouldpersonally visit us,'' Mrs. Barron said. ``But I believeeverything's going to be OK. And I'm praying for all the motherswho are waiting just like I am.''   Lt. Russell A. Greer, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman in Norfolk,said the explosion occurred while the ship was conducting open seasgunnery practice, but did not know if it occurred as the gun wasbeing fired.   Each gun's 16-inch-diameter projectile is propelled byexplosives in fabric bags loaded separately from the projectiles.The gun requires up to five bags, each containing 110 pounds ofpowder to fire a 2,700-pound round.   Asked about the safety of the ship by reporters this morning,President Bush said he would want to ensure that procedures werechecked ``to be sure that safety is at the highest point.''   ``But I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that because that kindof powder was put into these turrets in that way that that makes auseful platform obsolete,'' Bush said.   Naval officers familiar with the Iowa's gun turrets said anexplosion can occur if a gun breech, or back end of the barrel, iscracked, or from a shell that ``cooks off'' _ ignites prematurelyfrom the heat of the barrel or smoldering debris left in the barrelfrom the last round.   ``The first thing that comes to mind is something like acook-off,'' said Capt. Paul Hanley, another spokesman for theAtlantic Fleet. ``It could have been a (powder) bag, or aprojectile. We just don't know yet.''   Capt. Larry Seaquist, the Iowa's commanding officer until lastMay, told reporters at a Pentagon briefing that a compressed airsystem to clear hot debris from the breech must be operatedmanually, raising the possibility that the procedure was overlookedbefore fresh gunpowder was loaded into the gun.   ``Each of these men is well-trained and formally qualified to dothis,'' he said, and they drill regularly.   It was the worst loss of life in a naval accident since 1977,when 49 sailors died when a 56-foot launch returning sailors fromshore leave in Barcelona, Spain, to the USS Guam and the USSTrenton was hit by a Spanish freighter.   An Iraqi missile attack on the USS Stark in May 1987 killed 37crewmen and wounded 21.   A similiar explosion occurred in the center gun turret aboardthe heavy cruiser USS Newport News during the Vietnam War inOctober 1972, killing 20 crewmen and injuring 36.   ``It is a great tragedy and a matter of terrible sadness,''President Bush said in Washington. ``I will take this opportunityto express my regrets, especially to the families of the kids thatwere killed.''   A complement of 74 sailors normally man the massive turret,which is seven stories tall and weighs 1,800 tons, as much as aWorld War II destroyer, said Capt. Larry Seaquist, a formercommander of the Iowa who spoke to reporters at the Pentagon thismorning.   Burnett said the explosion and fire were confined to the turret,which is encased in 17-inch-thick steel armor on the sides and7\-inch armor on the top. Several forward powder magazines wereflooded by crewmen to prevent a second explosion.   The USS Iowa was one of 29 U.S. ships participating in athree-week training exercise to test fleet readiness, which beganApril 13.   The Iowa was commissioned in 1943. Besides its 16-inch guns, the887-foot Iowa is equipped with 12 five-inch guns and Tomahawk andHarpoon missiles. The Navy, in accordance with policy, declined toconfirm or deny whether any nuclear weapons were aboard.   The 58,000-ton warship is one of the biggest in the world,dwarfed only by the Japanese World War II battleships Yamato andMusashi, each at 72,000 tons.</TEXT></DOC>
