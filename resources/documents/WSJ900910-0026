Indeed, industry experts say a supplyglut will prevent renewed concern about alternative energysources from quickly resuscitating the depressed uraniummarket.   While spot uranium prices, quoted by Nuexco, a nuclearfuel broker, now are smartly higher than their February lowsof $8.70 a pound, they failed to follow oil's surge lastmonth. In fact, they dipped 25 cents to $11.45 a pound inAugust.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's more than sufficient supplies of uranium tosatisfy demand and it takes long lead times to propose andbuild new nuclear power plants,&quot; says Earl Hoellen, presidentand chief operating officer of Nuexco.   Spot uranium prices soared to a peak of $43.70 in 1978from $6 in 1973, mainly because of the two previous oil-priceshocks. Yet jaded delegates at a conference last weekorganized by the London-based Uranium Institute don't expecta repeat performance this time.   Uranium needs of nuclear reactors will rise marginally to47,500 metric tons in 1995 from 45,700 metric tons in 1990,estimates the institute, which represents producers andconsumers. Meanwhile, actual and potential supplies fromWestern producers, the Soviet Union, China and reprocessingplants will rise to 60,606 metric tons in 1995 from 46,848tons this year, the institute forecasts.   Over and above this projected imbalance of production overdemand are inventories of around 182,000 metric tons, theinstitute says. These stocks are likely to grow, conferencedelegates said last week, because of the U.S.-Soviet Unionagreement to reduce nuclear arsenals.   Nevertheless, nuclear power will be used more widely as aresult of the Gulf crisis and worries about the &quot;greenhouseeffect,&quot; contends Kunihiko Uematsu, director general of theOrganization For Economic Co-Operation and Development'sNuclear Energy Agency.   Primary energy use will rise by more than 60% world-widebetween 1985 and 2020, he predicts. A surge in demand isalready taking place in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,Mr. Uematsu says, and consumption will grow in developed, FarEastern, South American and Third World nations, he says.Currently, only 5% of the world's total primary energy isgenerated by nuclear power, he says.   Provided plants are vigilant about safety, nuclear powerhas clear environmental advantages, Mr. Uematsu says. Nuclearplants in operation and under construction will produce400,000 megawatts of electricity, he says. An equivalentamount generated by fossil fuels would release anunacceptable two billion tons of carbon dioxide.   The Chernobyl disaster made the public wary of nuclearpower however, Mr. Uematsu says. As a result, highly trainedworkers are leaving &quot;a declining industry,&quot; while fewerstudents are taking courses in nuclear engineering.   Some brokers blame the uranium glut on a market that isn'ttruly free. The vast majority of utilities, particularly inEurope and the Far East, buy uranium from producers at priceswell above the spot market price, says Heera Clark, vicepresident marketing and consulting, Uranium Exchange Co.   Utilities purchase uranium at $20 to $30 a pound to ensuresecurity of supplies, she says, an unnecessary premium giventhe surfeit of potential supplies. If users bought moreuranium on the open market, producers would be encouraged tolower output, she says, and the market would become morebalanced.   U.S. utilities, however, buy more uranium on the spotmarket than other international players, Ms. Clark says. Theyare forced to do so because rate payers keep a close watch oncosts.   &quot;Spot market transactions only account for about a seventhof annual uranium supplies,&quot; says Treva Klingbiel,director-market analysis at Nuexco. &quot;Yet, there are signsthat more U.S. and international utilities are takingadvantage of low prices.&quot;   Spot and near-term transactions rose 33% to 33 millionpounds (15,000 metric tons) last year and this year havereached 30 million pounds (13,600 tons) by the end of August,she says.   Nevertheless, uranium exploration spending tumbled to $128million in 1989 from $738 million in 1989, because of lowprices, says Douglas Underhill, Manager GeotechnicalConsulting, Nuclear Assurance Corporation. Unless minesexpand in the 1990s, he says, production will fall belowconsumption and prices will surge.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          Futures prices boomed Friday and could continue strong.Traders are growing increasingly concerned over productionproblems in foreign countries that could reduce supplies.   The most-actively traded December contract on New York'sCommodity Exchange rose to a new life-of-contract high of$1.3050 a pound before ending just slightly under that level,at $1.3035, a gain of 6.95 cents.   Chile recently suffered its third cave-in in a principalmine, and other producing countries such as Peru and Zambiaalso have troubles, analysts said.   Demand for futures contracts in New York was alsotriggered by strength in London, where Far Eastern buying offutures touched off buying by traders who previously soldshort contracts in anticipation of continued price declines,analysts said.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          Futures prices plunged Friday on profit-taking and otherselling, but analysts said concern over obtaining immediatelyavailable supplies of green coffee remained a strongpotential price-supporting factor.   The December contract ended with a loss of four cents apound at 98.25 cents after trading early in the session ashigh as $1.0260.   &quot;The price drop should be only a transitory development ifthe prospect that supplies of coffee over the near-term aregoing to be tight,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;Also, a price declineof this kind may cause roasters, who are now entering theirpeak processing season, to come in and buy needed supplies.&quot;                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          The latest government corn and soybean crop estimates tobe released Wednesday will be a dominant factor influencingfutures prices this week. Private sector estimates releasedlate last week of the corn crop as of Sept. 1 predicted aslightly higher figure than the Agriculture Department Aug. 1estimate of 7.85 billion bushels of corn. If those estimatesare borne out by the government figures on Wedneseday, cornfutures prices could come under selling pressure.   Private soybean estimates straddle the government's Aug. 1figure of 1.836 billion bushels. Traders said it was unlikelythat speculators would be amassing any sizable tradingpositions in either crop ahead of release of the governmentestimates after the close of trading Wednesday.   Hot and dry weather forecasted for most growing regionsthis week may threaten harvest yields and lends support tofutures prices. But analysts said that a slight increase inthe chance that it may rain in Mississippi River deltagrowing areas this week, may rein in any weather-relatedfutures price advances.</TEXT></DOC>
