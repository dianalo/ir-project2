 What we actually do is quitedifferent.andP;  Announcements, unsolicited newsletters, releases informing us ofnew conferences and &quot;junk&quot; express mail fill our mailboxes and clutter ourdesktops--and trash cans.andP;  The more paper we receive, the easier it is tothrow out envelopes and packages routinely we &quot;suspect&quot; aren't terriblyimportant.andP;  Our E-mail files inflate to the point where we start to deleteunread notes based on message headers, whim, expedience, and our currentevaluation of the hierarchal importance of the message's author.andP;  We log ontothe important internal and external conferences we belong to less frequentlyand our contributions become increasingly cursory.andM;The overload of information has swung the pendulum far to one side and we arereacting to that extreme.andP;  Just when increasing the surveillance of all thisinformation would yield the greatest payoffs for our business, we cut back onour access more and more.andP;  Keeping up with the information is too much of asecond job; we have real jobs to get done every day.andP;  Or so the argumentgoes.andM;A VIEW OF THE WORLD.andP;  Several months ago, I attended a seminar that focusedon the issue of retrieving and managing large amounts of information.andP;  At onepoint, the speaker placed a diagram on the whiteboard, labelled it minimally,and left it there for a while to act as a backdrop to his comments.andP;  Thecryptic diagram the speaker drew is shown in Illustration 1.andM;The smallest slice of the pie represents what we know.andP;  These are the annualreports that fill the shelves of our offices, the volumes of documentation,of system and corporate procedures, threaded conferences and E-mail systemsthat we can navigate through, paper files our assistants can find and bringto us, lists of things-to-do and next-steps, the myriad heuristic andgenerally unwritten rules and patterns that guide us through our jobs, and,of course, information in those ubiquitous yuppie-books that allocate thehours of our lives in 15-minute segments.andM;Of considerably more interest is the next slice, a much larger one than thefirst: What we know we don't know.andP;  We know there are IRS rulings and SECregulations that contain important information that we'll probably never havea chance to discover.andP;  We know there are informative seminars and keynotepresentations going on out there, but short of sending teams of our employeesout to all the conferences, this is information that we may never get holdof.andP;  We know that, every day, there are scores of important press releasesand online conversations that are dealing with precisely the same issues orproblems that we're grappling with at our home offices--but chances are we'llnever see them.andP;  And finally, we know there are legions of graduate studentsand post-docs working on technological products we have a use for today, butwe know some of them don't publish the results of their work in anything wewill ever read, or in anything that we can ever hope to get a translation of.andO;We have an advantage here.andP;  We know, at the very least, the broad outlines ofthe information we're lacking.andP;  What we need to do, quite often, is fill inthe gaps in our knowledge.andM;A critical problem exists.andP;  Often, we don't know either where missinginformation may be found, or worse, where there are gaps in our knowledge.andO;In other words, we don't even know how to ask the right questions.andP;  Hence,the third slice of the diagram.andP;  The richest source of information can bedescribed as what we don't know we don't know.andP;  This is truly the mother lodeof missing pieces to the puzzles we face, these are the solutions or at leastclear restatements of our business problems, these are the novel andimaginative ideas, and, most importantly, these are business opportunitiesthat can be exploited quickly.andM;WWDKWDK CAN HURT YOU.andP;  The following are items from a wide range of onlinesources.andP;  Each had the potential to generate business.andP;  The chances arebetter than even that those who could have profited most never knew thisinformation existed.andP;  They didn't know what they didn't know, and businessopportunities were lost as a result.andM;Item That Should Have Triggered Interest.andP;  The first entertainment arcadeusing Virtual Reality interfaces has just opened in a Chicago suburb.andP;  Costis $7 per half-hour of play, the average time spent by the patrons is twohours, and 6,000 people have lined up to play during the first week of thearcade operation.andM;Your company is monitoring business visualization techniques, and yourAdvanced Technology Group is looking at interface techniques that make thedata especially compelling.andP;  How likely is it that your graphics anduser-interface group saw this message and will follow up with queries to thearcade games' designers?andM;Item That Should Have Suggested a Business Opportunity.andP;  In an effort toacquire Western currency, the government of Yugoslavia is selling all futuredevelopment rights on kilometer stretches of the coastal highway that hugsthe Adriatic coast of that country.andP;  Investment requires cash only, and, inreturn, any and all development on &quot;your&quot; stretch of highway is a right youcan sell or lease to others forever.andM;How many speculators took advantage of the opportunity?andM;Item That Clarified an Issue.andP;  Over the last few months, numerous mentions ofthe creation and charter of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) havebeen made.andP;  For the most part, press coverage of the EFF has focused on itspursuit of the clarification of First Amendment Rights as applicable tomaterial found in public access electronic bulletin boards.andP;  The announcementof the creation of the foundation first appeared in a newsfeed on theInternet.andP;  In that release, the EFF described its broad charter to creatediscussions and pursue a wide range of issues.andP;  How many of us are aware ofthe much more encompassing goals of this important foundation?andM;LOOKING FOR CONCEPTS, NOT KEYWORDS.andP;  How do we get atwhat-we-don't-know-we-don't-know?andP;  How can we be on the alert for informationthat may help us, but the exact parameters of which we cannot know untilafter we have retrieved it?andP;  How can we, in some electronic sense, send outthe equivalent of our alter egos, digital persona with interests similar toours, to graze on an informational savanna?andM;The Topic retrieval software, available from Verity Incorporated, offers whatis probably the most elegant of current solutions to this major problem.andO;Algorithms used in Verity's software engine differ significantly fromexisting keyword- and Boolean-based retrieval techniques.andP;  Retrieval is basedon the assumption that, usually, information that can help us the most isneither completely relevant nor completely irrelevant to any particular querywe can formulate.andP;  Moreover, the software recognizes the fact that ourevaluations of relevance are often subjective and that retrieval mustaccommodate to our changing focus on what is important.andP;  Topic softwareallows us to build retrieval &quot;concepts&quot;--structured outlines of weightedideas--that can be sent out to peruse information.andP;  What we get back is aranked list, a list where articles closest to our interests are at the top,and those furthest away, at the bottom.andP;  The performance of this retrieval isby use of a set of algorithms that operate according to the rules ofevidential reasoning.andP;  (See Illustration 2.)andM;AND THEN THERE WERE NONE.andP;  There's a well-worn dramatic vehicle in suspensestories where the heinous crime takes place in some enclosed environment--aGothic mansion or a train rolling through the Balkans.andP;  One character thenproceeds to examine the evidence, weight the likelihood of actions, and applyclear logic to determine the most likely culprit.andP;  We can twist thecircumstances only slightly and have the Topic's evidential reasoning searchthrough information about the suspects for us.andM;We can imagine a large database of information about people, ranging fromdemographic information to personal histories and anecdotal stories.andP;  Buriedwithin that body of data are the clues for our investigation: Who knew thevictim, does he/she have an alibi, are his/her fingerprints on the murderweapon, is there a witness claiming to have seen the guest leaving the sceneof the crime, and finally, how did each guest feel about the dear departed?andM;Each of those six questions is potentially a bit of evidence that can condemnor exonerate any particular guest.andP;  In an attempt to locate a likely suspect,any probe through our database using conventional retrieval techniques wouldrequire an extensive set of Boolean search statements.andP;  For example:andM;1.andP;  Person X knew victim OR had no alibi OR hated victim OR ..andM;2.andP;  Person X knew victim AND had no alibi AND hated victim AND ..andM;3.andP;  Person X (knew victim AND eyewitness) OR (no alibi AND hated victim ANDfingerprints on murder weapon) .. ...andM;A complete set of Boolean search statements for these factors contains 6! (6factorial) statements, i.e., 720 permutations.andP;  With fewer queries,information--and the identity of the murderer--can slip through the fingersof our resident sleuth.andM;The approach taken by Topic is considerably more efficient than this sort ofretrieval of simple linear text strings.andP;  In this hypothetical case, anoutline describing the concept of &quot;guilt&quot; would be constructed.andP;  Making upthis concept outline, this &quot;topic,&quot; are series of terms or phrases (or other,previously constructed concept outlines).andP;  Terms and phrases are givenrelevance rankings by the outline creator.andP;  Several factors can point toguilt in our example.andP;  Some facts are more condemnatory than others.andP;  Forexample, hating the victim is clearly important in determining who performedthe crime, and although it is less conclusive than having one's fingerprintson the murder weapon it is more so than simply having known the victim.andO;Together, these weighted arguments combine to form the retrieval concept ofguilt.andM;The creation of these outlines of relevance can be done manually orautomatically.andP;  In the latter case, the Topic user can find an article thatis of interest and have the software construct the outline automatically.andP;  Inour murder example, you could (conceivably) feed in the relevant sections ofthe last chapter of an Agatha Christie novel--the chapter in which thereasoning is described--and one of the many resulting topics would be arelevance outline of the concept of guilt.andM;MINING THE MOTHER LODE.andP;  So how does this allow us to find out what we don'tknow, or, more importantly, how will it direct us to &quot;what we don't know wedon't know?&quot;andP;  We've already hinted at the answer.andP;  By creating or adjustingretrieval &quot;topics,&quot; or by allowing the software to build Topics-by-Examples,what we're doing is creating a constellation of intersests that can go forthand point out information we might never have known about.andP;  Articles andreferences are found and are presented to us in order of the relevance theyhave to our selected queries.andP;  In this simple example, we build (or havebuilt for us) a retrieval topic of &quot;guilt.&quot;andP;  This topic is sent out toevaluate the information we've compiled about a number of people.andP;  What weget back is a ranked list of suspects, with the most likely murderer being atthe top of the retrieval list, and the least likely suspect, at the bottom.andO;In the more commonplace searches we do in our offices, the articles,newsfeeds, and chunks of ongoing conference conversations that most closelyapproximate our specified interests are presented to us in ranked order.andO;Those that most closely approximate our interests are ranked higher thanthose sources that only touch on some of our interests.andM;The result is that we see more information that interests us, and we do sowith less work than would be demanded by any other current retrievaltechnique.andP;  We come back to the recurring theme for the Office ComputingGroup's ongoing Knowledge Base project.andP;  Our goals have always been simple:They are to find ways that allow more people to gain access to moreinformation more easily, to find ways that allow people to perform their jobsmore effectively.andP;  We believe Verity's Topic retrieval engine can perform apivotal role in our ongoing efforts at building a corporate Knowledge Base.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
