At least four deaths were blamed on Allison, which at its heightreached the status of tropical storm, the first of the Atlantichurricane season. A tropical storm is one step below a hurricane.   Southeast Texas began drying out today, although scores of peopleremained out of their homes because of streams and rivers thatcontinued to flood.   But rain continued this morning in Louisiana, where the NationalWeather Service reported more than 7 inches in Baton Rouge lateTuesday and early today.   Street flooding near Louisiana State University knocked out powerand canceled classes. Flooding also closed part of Interstate 110 inBaton Rouge.   Just south in Plaquemine, more than 150 homes had about 2 inchesof water in them, forcing the evacuation of about 20 people, ChiefDeputy Ralph Stassi said.   ``This is the most rain that's fallen in this short a period oftime that I can remember,'' said Stassi.   The tornadoes Tuesday moved along a mile-long path near Monroe,La. No serious injuries were reported, but more than 100 homes weredamaged.   Jachin Little, Ouachita Parish civil defense director, said fiveof the homes were destroyed and 10 more had damage that made themuninhabitable.   Buddy Sharp, who sought safety in the bathroom of his home whenthe twister hit, said he heard windows blow out and an outside walltorn off.   ``That is some awesome power,'' Sharp said. ``It takes anythingit wants, and does what it wants with it.''   Meanwhile, a thunderstorm in Wapakoneta, Ohio, on Tuesday toppledscores of trees and damaged several houses, tearing the corner offof a brick home, officials said. No serious injuries were reported.Wapakoneta is about 70 miles northwest of Columbus.   ``It was overpowering,'' said Niki Dunham, who saw a 200-year-oldwalnut tree in her backyard felled by the storm. ``It was like a bigblack ball of smoke. It almost actually pushed me in the house. Iwas terrified.''   In Texas, Harris County Sheriff's Department divers pulled thebody of 18-year-old Don Gilliam from rain-swollen Spring Creek lateTuesday. Friends said Gilliam went under while trying to swim acrossthe creek. On Monday, a traffic death in the Beaumont area wasblamed on the storm.   A 7-year-old Houston girl survived an overnight ordeal inside astorm sewer, clinging to the bricks for 12 hours before beingrescued by construction workers. Latricia Reese suffered cuts on herknees and elbows and mild shock and was hospitalized in goodcondition.   Divers at Beaumont found the bodies of two boys, ages 15 and 16,who disappeared Tuesday while playing on a rubber raft in a drainageditch, police said.   For many Houston-area residents, the storm marked the second timein six weeks that they were rousted from their homes by floods.   ``We were just about finished with the work (from the May storm)and I guess we'll have to rework it now,'' Bruce Jett said of hishome in nearby Spring, where 14 inches of rain fell.   In Pasadena and Deer Park, southeastern suburbs of Houston, morethan 16 inches of rain was recorded in the past four days.   Traffic resumed on Interstate 45 north of downtown Houston atmid-afternoon Tuesday, nearly a full day after the main north-southfreeway was blocked by high water.   Many side roads in the area remained flooded today.   In its final statement on the progress of the storm, the NationalHurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., said Tuesday the center ofwhat was once Allison was breaking up about near Lufkin, Texas,which is about 120 miles north of Houston.   Allison on Monday became the first named storm of the 1989Atlantic hurricane season when its sustained winds reached 39 mph.It came ashore south of Houston and then inched its way throughsoutheast Texas at about 5 mph.</TEXT></DOC>
