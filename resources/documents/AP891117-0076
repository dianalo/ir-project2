By daylight, fighting had tapered off, and San Salvador woke toits quietest morning since a rebel offensive began six days ago.The latest casualties included a British journalist who was shotand seriously wounded.   The offensive _ the rebels' biggest in their 10-year-old warwith the U.S.-backed government _ has killed at least 800 peopleand wounded 1,600 nationwide, according to hospitals and thegovernment.   Although gunfire was heard throughout the night, it was mildcompared to the intensity of previous days. An overnight curfewmade it impossible to reach battle zones to assess the situation.   U.S. Ambassador William Walker told The Associatd Press todaythat the United States was prepared to offer protection to anyonewho would come forward with information about the massacre Thursdayof six Jesuit priests.   Walker said he would contact officials at the Jesuit universitywho have said two witnesses saw about 30 men in army uniforms enterthe priests' residence just before the shooting began.   The entire capital seemed to be under fire Thursday. Air forcejets screamed overhead, followed by thundering explosions as bombsdropped on rebel strongholds.   Several hundred guerrillas descended overnight from the hillsabove the northern neighborhood of Mejicanos to try to take controlof the main streets.   That is where the British journalist, David Michael Blundy ofthe Sunday Correspondent of London, was caught in a crossfire andwounded early today. Blundy was shot in the right shoulder andtaken to Rosales Hospital, where he was listed in serious condition.   In Soyapango on the eastern side of the city, the rebelsappeared to have backed down after intense house-to-house combat.   Fighting also raged in northern Zacamil, a neighborhood therebels have held since Saturday.   About 1,500 guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front are thought to be involved in the attack in SanSalvador.   Thousands of Salvadorans have been forced to flee their homes,and many have blamed the guerrillas for their misery.   ``We were caught in the cross fire,'' Angel Erazo said Thursdayas she clutched a kitten in one hand and a bag of clothes in theother. ``It was a horrible night.''   Residents of one neighborhood who had been without food for dayslooted a marketplace.   ``We have no food, no money, nowhere to go,'' sobbed AdiliaHernandez of Zacamil.   Rebel leaders have acknowledged they cannot win the war. Theguerrillas, estimated to have 7,000 full-time fighters and 11,000backups nationwide, are heavily outnumbered by the 56,000-memberSalvadoran army and other security forces.   The rebels said they attacked to prove the army also cannot win.   They say rightist President Alfredo Cristiani cannot governwithout granting a role to their front.   The guerrillas began their attacks Saturday, three days afterthey broke off peace talks with the U.S.-backed government,claiming it was not serious about reaching a settlement.</TEXT></DOC>
