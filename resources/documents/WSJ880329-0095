The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said production at Japanese factories and mines rose 12.5% in February from a year earlier -- the biggest gain since output began a series of monthly increases last June -- and a seasonally adjusted 2.3% from January.    The ministry said the report showed that Japanese manufacturers have recovered from a slump caused by the strong yen. Largely through the use of stimulative spending, Japan has shifted its economy so that it is dependent on domestic demand, instead of exports, as its chief source of growth.    MITI said separately that sales at major retail stores rose 8.6% in February from a year earlier, illustrating that personal spending remains strong.    Meanwhile, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said that steel exports fell 12.1% in February from a year earlier, to 1.8 million metric tons, the 18th consecutive monthly decline. But shipments to the U.S. rose 7.9%, to 346,600 tons.    Exports of steel products with a high degree of added value generally rose, while shipments of basic products -- which face strong competition from other Asian nations -- declined.    In a fourth report, the Japanese Foreign Trade Council said export contracts concluded by 17 big trading houses rose 16.7% in February from a year earlier, while import contracts grew 10.6%. The houses handle about 50% of the nation's exports and 65% of its imports, and the data provide an early indication of short-term trade trends. </TEXT></DOC>
