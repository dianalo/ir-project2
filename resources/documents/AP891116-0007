(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two years ago he wore tailored suits anddined at the Harvard Club. Today, Wall Street felon Ivan Boesky issaid to eat at Mister Donut and wear a bushy beard and long,unkempt hair like Howard Hughes.   Boesky, the focus of Wall Street's insider trading scandals, ison a three-week furlough from a minimum-security federal prisoncamp in Lompoc, Calif.   The owner of a local convenience store said Wednesday that a manidentified as Boesky in a front-page photo in the tabloid New YorkPost ``looked like a homeless person'' and asked about the sugarand salt content of foods during a weekend shopping visit.   The newspaper reported that Boesky is staying with friends inthe Stamford area during his release.   The man in the photo, wearing unkempt, long white hair and abeard, was dressed in sweat pants and running shoes and carried agym bag and a full change of clothing.   Pete Tournas, 22, owner of For Your Convenience near downtownStamford, said the man shopped at the store two or three times overthe weekend. But Tournas said he didn't know who he was untilseeing the newspaper photos.   On one trip, the man believed to be Boesky bought $45 worth ofgroceries and asked questions about the sugar content of somecereals and the salt in other foods, Tournas said. He ``seemed tobe on a health kick,'' Tournas said.   Boesky, whose fortune once was estimated at $200 million, wasaccompanied by a friend who paid for the groceries, he said.   ``He was a real friendly guy, a good-natured type,'' Tournassaid. ``But he stuck out like a sore thumb.''   Boesky, 52, applied for and was granted the furlough, whichbegan last Thursday, prison officials said. He is due back atLompoc, where he is serving a three-year term, around the end ofthe month.   Boesky attorney Leon Silverman on Wednesday declined to discusshis client's release.   In Stamford, Boesky also supposedly was spotted in a MisterDonut coffee shop, across the street from the Yeshiva BaisBinyomin, a Jewish academy for Talmudic research.   Boesky is known to have developed an interest in Judaic studiesand had endowed a $20 million library at the Jewish TheologicalSeminary in New York City.   He was rumored to have attended night classes at the Stamfordacademy over the weekend, but the head of the Yeshiva denied Boeskyhad been there and said he knew of no plans for Boesky to attend.   Boesky's rabbi in New York City, Wolfe Kelman, also declined tocomment.   Boesky, who owns a 75-acre estate north of New York City, iseligible for release from prison next April. In prison, Boeskyreportedly has been working on a cleanup crew, lifting weights andgrowing the beard.   Three years ago Tuesday, Boesky paid $100 million to theSecurities and Exchange Commission and agreed to plead guilty toone criminal count to settle charges related to a large insidertrading network.   Boesky is cooperating with the government and still is expectedto testify against former junk bond financier Michael Milken, whosetrial is set for next year.   Legal experts said they expect defense lawyers in the Milkencase to try to use the Post photos, in which the subject resemblesthe late eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes, to discredit Boesky.But they were expected to have a tough time getting them admittedin court.   ``If he looks weird or erratic it's the kind of information agood defense attorney will want before a jury,'' said Harvey J.Goldschmid, a Columbia University securities law professor.</TEXT></DOC>
