Although Kuwait has said it won't interfere in BP's management, its stake -- most recently reported at 18.35% -- eventually could aid another bidder for BP.    In early October, BP looked set to become the biggest success yet in the government's privatization program. Then the Oct. 19 stock-market crash threatened disaster, as the market price of BP's shares plummeted far below the level at which underwriters had agreed to buy the BP stock offered by the government.    A temporary price-support system, under which the British government agreed to buy back BP shares at a floor price, allowed the government to proceed with the #7.24 billion ($13.1 billion) public offering Oct. 30. Within two weeks, the Kuwaitis emerged as steady buyers of BP shares, providing unexpected help for the government. When the buy-back offer expired last week, the government had been stuck with less than 1% of BP's shares and the Kuwaitis had acquired more than 18%.    Though the price-support plan allowed the government to shed nearly all of its BP shares amid market turmoil, critics questioned the wisdom of allowing a foreign entity to acquire such a large stake in the country's biggest oil company.    The latest round of reassurances came Friday from the British government itself. After weeks of silence, the Treasury said in a statement that &quot;Kuwait authorities have assured us that they have no ambitions to control BP nor any interest in any management role.&quot; The Kuwaitis made their assurances in mid-December, by which time they had a 16% stake in BP.    A Treasury spokesman said Friday's announcement was made in response to increasing press interest in the matter. BP and the Kuwait Investment Office, Kuwait's London-based investment arm, declined to comment.    In trading late Friday on London's stock exchange, BP was quoted at 262 pence ($4.73), down seven pence (12.6 cents) from Thursday. The new BP shares, sold on a partly paid basis in the offer, were quoted at 77 pence, down 2 1/2 pence. Buyers of those shares paid 120 pence apiece at the time of the offering and are due to pay the remaining 210 pence in two further installments.    Under British takeover rules, Kuwait can acquire as much as 29.9% of the company. Beyond that level, Kuwait would have to make a bid for all of BP's shares -- an action that could be blocked on national-interest grounds.    The Treasury spokesman said Friday that the government and the Kuwaitis haven't discussed limiting the stake. He also said there isn't a ceiling beyond which the government would become concerned.    Kuwait's state-owned oil company is seeking to expand its refining and marketing operations in Europe; stock market traders have speculated Kuwait may yet seek some form of cooperation with BP.    What may worry BP more is that Kuwait, known as an opportunistic and shrewd investor, would sell its stake to another company with more predatory aims. That possibility mightn't be strong, because of BP's mammoth size and because of the inevitable political opposition such a move would provoke. But Kuwait, by staying off the board and out of management, remains free to act swiftly.    The government's tolerance of Kuwait's role, convenient this time, could make opposing future foreign investments in major British companies more difficult. Foreign ownership is an emotional topic in Britain. A fracas over the acquisition by U.S.-based United Technologies Corp. and Fiat S.p.A. of Italy in a British helicopter maker, Westland PLC, caused a political crisis two years ago, leading to the resignations of two cabinet ministers.    Late last year, some politicians objected to a proposal by Scandinavian Airlines System, a carrier owned partly by three Scandinavian governments, to buy a large stake in British Caledonian Airways. SAS agreed to limit its stake, but British Caledonian eventually accepted a sweetened offer from British Airways.    The question of foreign involvement may arise again in the battle for control of Britoil PLC, a smaller British oil company. BP, which owns 29.9% of Britoil, has offered to buy the rest in a bid valuing Britoil at a total of #2.27 billion. But BP may face opposition from Atlantic Richfield Co. of the U.S., which last Friday said it boosted its stake in Britoil to 22.93% from 22.24%. The government would be hardpressed to justify favoring BP over Arco, particuarly because BP only last year completed its takeover of Standard Oil Co. of the U.S. Currently, the government says it intends to use a special share in Britoil to block any bidder from gaining control. </TEXT></DOC>
