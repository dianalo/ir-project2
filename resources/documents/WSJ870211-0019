Garcia</HL><DD> 02/11/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices sank in moderately active trading as investors began to worry that some widely anticipated interest rate declines might not materialize soon.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 18.70 to 2158.04 after dropping nearly 25 points in the previous two sessions. Prices began to sink at the opening bell, with many investors taking profits in blue-chip issues, which have had a large run-up since year's end. The sell-off accelerated around midday as a few sell programs tied to stock-index futures surfaced.    The decline was again broad, with losers on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbering gainers by a margin of about 2 to 1 for the second consecutive day. Volume rose to 168.3 million shares from 143.3 million Monday. But yesterday's pace was much slower than the frenzied trading that characterized many sessions during January's rally.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.09 to 275.07, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 1.65 to 157.18.    Smaller-capitalization issues also gave ground. The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index dropped 3.01 to 313.64, and the Nasdaq OTC composite index fell 2.28 to 403.50.    The word &quot;correction,&quot; which was dropped temporarily from Wall Street's lexicon in the past five weeks, is back as the Dow Jones Industrial Average has declined for three consecutive sessions and investors have begun focusing on the potential negative consequences of the dollar's swift decline.    Investors had quickly bid up the stocks of companies that benefit from a lower dollar, primarily multinational concerns such as drug and chemical firms. Now they worry that the Federal Reserve System, concerned about inflation, might not be so eager to lower interest rates. A few analysts believe the Fed has already shifted to a less accommodative monetary policy by restricting the growth of non-borrowed reserves.    &quot;When the market is going up, everything is bullish,&quot; said one New York-based broker. &quot;But when the market is going down, they reinterpret the news.&quot;    Steven Einhorn, co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman Sachs in New York, advised clients to raise the cash position in their portfolios to 10% from 5%. He sees a lull in the stock market rally because stocks are slightly overvalued compared with bonds and there aren't any short-term prospects for lower rates. He expects the rally to continue later in the year.    The recent rise in crude oil prices and some government data hinting at a more robust economy in January could further deter any rate cuts by the central bank, analysts added.    Michael Metz, a market strategist with Oppenheimer andamp; Co. in New York, said that the gain in valuation that stocks derive from lower interest rates and slower inflation &quot;is already in the market and can't take it any higher.&quot; He added that investors have already made a huge downpayment on a resurgence in corporate earnings this year, but evidence of that revival is still quite mixed.    With profit-taking on their minds, investors zeroed on semiconductor issues. The prospects for a revival in the industry seem less than rosy.    The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the U.S.-Japanese trade agreement covering semiconductor sales in both countries seemed close to collapse as U.S. concerns asked President Reagan to take punitive measures against Japanese chip producers.    Texas Instruments tumbled 6 1/2 to 152; Motorola dropped 1 1/2 to 46 1/2; Advanced Micro Devices fell 5/8 to 21 1/8; and National Semiconductor declined 1/8 to 14 1/4. But Intel ended up 1/4 at 35 1/4 after trading as low as 34.    Other technology issues also lost ground. Digital Equipment fell 2 1/4 to 150; Cray Research, which introduced four supercomputers, fell 1 1/4 to 117 3/4; NCR fell 1 3/8 to 57 1/2; and International Business Machines eased 3/8 to 133 3/8.    Honeywell ended unchanged at 64 7/8. The company said earnings for the first quarter should be about even with a year earlier, when it earned 57 cents a share. But it expects earnings to improve substantially as the year goes on, exceeding $5 a share in 1987.    Profit-taking continued in paper, forest product and chemical issues. Bank, thrift and utility stock prices sank as bond prices weakened. Federal National Mortgage Association fell 1 1/2 to 45 3/8 on volume of more than 3.6 million shares, highest on the Big Board.    ITT fell 2 to 60 in active trading. The stock moved up 2 3/8 Monday on expectations that the company's board, which met yesterday, might announce a stock buyback. However, the board didn't make any announcements after its meeting.    First Interstate bucked the trend and rose 1 to 57. The West Coast bank dropped its takeover offer for BankAmerica, saying BankAmerica's continued asset sales made First Interstate's $3.23 billion takeover proposal too high. BankAmerica fell 1 to 12 7/8 on more than 2.1 million shares.    Gulf States Utilities rose 1/2 to 9 3/8 on more than one million shares. The cash-strapped utility asked a Louisiana state court to order resubmission of a Gulf States rate increase request to the state's public utilities commission, which originally rejected it.    Diamond Shamrock eased 1/8 to 14 3/4 on heavy trading. The company turned down a $300 million tender offer for 20 million shares from T. Boone Pickens Jr. and launched its own tender. There were rumors Mr. Pickens was a seller of the stock; he declined to comment.    Salomon fell 5/8 to 39 1/8 in active trading. The investment banking and brokerage concern reported a decline in fourth-quarter earnings to 54 cents a share from 90 cents.    RJR Nabisco slid 1 5/8 to 58 1/2. The tobacco and food company said earnings from continuing operations rose to $1.26 a share in the fourth quarter from $1.15 a year earlier. Other food and tobacco issues were mostly lower.    Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a private investment firm, agreed to take Owen-Illinois private at $60.50 a share. Kohlberg Kravis made an initial proposal for Owens-Illinois last December. The stock eased 1/4 to 59 3/4 in active trading.    Viacom International rose 1/8 to 44 5/8. The entertainment concern rejected a takeover offer received last week from a unit of National Amusements, saying it was less favorable than an existing offer that includes some members of senior management.    First Capital Holdings rose 5/8 to 25 5/8. The company agreed to acquire E.F. Hutton's insurance unit for $300 million. Hutton declined 7/8 to 40 5/8. </TEXT></DOC>
