Jefferson   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/07/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><CO>   GD</CO><IN>AEROSPACE (ARO)EARNINGS (ERN)</IN><LP>   General Dynamics Corp. posted a fourth-quarter net loss of$530.1 million, or $12.71 a share, after taking the biggestcharge in its history -- $566.9 million -- for severaltroubled programs, including the canceled A-12 Navy attackplane.   Without the charges, the St. Louis aerospace concern wouldhave earned $36.8 million, or 88 cents a share, less thanhalf the year-earlier net income of $82.8 million, or $1.98 ashare. Sales fell to $2.6 billion from $2.64 billion.</LP><TEXT>   The charges, which amounted to $858.9 million beforetaxes, included a $274 million pretax increase in reservesagainst investments made on the A-12. That was in addition toa $450 million charge on the program General Dynamics took inthe second quarter. Early last month, Defense Secretary DickCheney canceled the A-12 program, declaring that the companyand its team partner, McDonnell Douglas Corp., had defaultedon the contract.   The Pentagon has said it will seek to collect $1.35billion in payments it believes it is due from thecontractors as a result of the cancellation. It has agreed,however, to wait to collect that money until the two sidesagree to settle the matter or until the issue is decided inthe courts.   The decision to delay collection of the $1.35 billion isintended &quot;to avoid putting extreme financial pressure onthese companies,&quot; Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams toldreporters at a briefing. &quot;It is not a bailout by any means.&quot;If and when the Pentagon does collect that amount, it willcharge interest, which under terms of the Contract DisputeAct is currently set at 8 3/8%.   General Dynamics didn't rule out the possibility it willhave to take further charges on the A-12 program, though itdid say that with the fourth-quarter charge it has expensedall unreimbursable costs associated with the A-12. &quot;It wouldbe premature to state whether this is the last charge relatedto the A-12 program,&quot; a company spokesman said. This week,McDonnell Douglas took a $219 million write-off on the theA-12, its first charge on the program.   Analysts were more surprised by the other hits GeneralDynamics took in the fourth quarter than by the A-12 charges.The additional charges included a $300 million loss on itsAtlas commercial launch business; a $70 million charge on theSingle Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System; and aone-time charge of $214.9 million for various restructuringactions taken in light of the decline in defense spending.   &quot;The write-offs were absolutely stunning,&quot; said JerryCantwell, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. in NewYork. &quot;Nobody was expecting anything of this magnitude.&quot;   Given the timing and the size of the charges, GeneralDynamics appears to have &quot;cleaned the slate&quot; for its newchairman and chief executive officer, William Anders, whotook over at the beginning of the year, Mr. Cantwell added.Still, the operating performance in the quarter -- withper-share earnings from continuing operations of 88 cents --was lower than expected. &quot;At a running rate of 88 cents forthe quarter, you wouldn't make $5 for the year,&quot; which iswhat the analyst is projecting the company will earn a sharein 1991.   For 1990, General Dynamics had a loss of $577.9 million,or $13.86 a share, on sales of $10.17 billion. The lossincluded $881.1 million of charges and $61.5 million ofearnings from discontinued operations. Without the charges,earnings were $303.2 million, or $7.27 a share. In 1989, thecompany earned $293.1 million, or $7.01 a share, on sales of$10.04 billion. Backlog of funded U.S. government orders atthe end of 1990 was $18.6 billion, and total backlog was$23.1 billion.   The company posted its earnings after the close ofbusiness. In New York Stock Exchange composite tradingyesterday, General Dynamics shares closed up $1.50 at $28 onthe news of the Pentagon's agreement to defer collecting thedisputed $1.35 billion on the A-12 program.   Mr. Anders said the financial results &quot;reflect theunprecedented market uncertainties of our industry,&quot; addingthat &quot;these uncertainties will test our ability as anorganization to adapt effectively to the new realities of ourbusiness.&quot;   General Dynamics said it doesn't anticipate any immediateimpact on its sales because of the Mideast war, a factclearly displayed by the $214.9 million restructuring chargein the fourth quarter. &quot;Because of an anticipated decline indefense spending, which became particularly evident duringthe fourth quarter, the company recognized that additionalrestructuring actions were necessary,&quot; General Dynamics saidin explaining the charge.   The $300 million write-down on the commercial Atlasprogram reflects the overall slump in the commercial launchbusiness, with the company having fewer launches than plannedin 1990 and 1991. Prospects for commercial launchers lookeven gloomier in the years ahead, with increased competitionexpected from the Soviets, the Chinese and the Japanese.Still, General Dynamics said it &quot;remains committed&quot; tocommercial launches.   ---   Andy Pasztor in Washington contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
