The revised rule states an alternate ECCS performanceanalysis, based on best-estimate methods, may be used to provide morerealistic estimates of plant safety margins, provided the licensee quantifiesthe uncertainty of the estimates and included that uncertainty when comparingthe calculated results with prescribed acceptance limits. To supportthe revised ECCS rule, the NRC and its contractors and consultants havedeveloped and demonstrated a method called the Code Scaling, Applicability,and Uncertainty (CSAU) evaluation methodology. It is an auditable, traceable,and practical method for combining quantitative analyses and expert opinionsto arrive at computed values of uncertainty. This paper provides an overviewof the CSAU evaluation methodology and its application to a postulatedcold-leg, large-break loss-of-coolant accident in a Westinghouse four-looppressurized water reactor with 17 {times} 17 fuel. The code selectedfor this demonstration of the CSAU methodology was TRAC-PF1/MOD1, Version14.3. 23 refs., 5 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
