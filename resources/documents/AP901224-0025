Mayor Will Sign Landmark VDT Law, Aides Say</HEAD><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Businesses will have up to four yearsinstead of two to provide safer equipment and working conditionsfor video display terminal users, under a compromise Mayor ArtAgnos has agreed to sign, his aides say.   What was hailed as the nation's toughest VDT law won finalapproval last week from the city Board of Supervisors, but Agnoswouldn't commit to signing it until he talked to business and laborgroups about its impact and cost.   After a weekend meeting with Agnos, the two sides agreedSaturday to several amendments, one extending the compliance periodfrom two years to as many as four years, the mayor's aides said.   The compromise, which Agnos plans to sign Thursday, must go backto the supervisors for approval.   ``This is an example of what happens when both sides come to thetable. And we now have something that both sides can live with,''said Claude Everhart, deputy mayor for government operations, whomediated the negotiations.   The compromise measure still calls for frequent work breaks,proper lighting, anti-glare screens, adjustable computer furnitureand equipment to make VDT use safer.   Among the problems associated with regular work at a computerkeyboard are nerve damage to the wrists and fingers, back and neckstrain, eye strain, sleep disturbances, chronic headaches, nauseaand fatigue.   Labor leaders hope the VDT law will be a model for other citiesand counties in California and for the state and other statesnationwide.   Business groups have consistently opposed efforts to pass suchlegislation because of its expense and because some doubt VDT usecauses health problems.   City budget analysts estimate businesses will spend as much as$76.5 million and the city as much as $6 million to comply with thelaw.   The board on Dec. 17 passed the ordinance on a 7-4 vote, justshort of the eight votes needed to override an Agnos veto.   At Saturday's eight-hour meeting, business and labor leadersagreed to implement the law in three stages.   First, any new equipment purchased one year or more after thelaw is adopted must conform to the new standards.   Within 30 months, businesses must bring most workstations intoconformance with VDT safety standards.   If doing so costs more than $250, those businesses will have anadditional 18 months to comply.   The law applies to companies with 15 or more employees. It alsocreates an advisory panel to monitor research about possibleradiation hazards and other heath effects from VDT use.</TEXT></DOC>
