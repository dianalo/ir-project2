Home Affairs Minister Moven Mahachi cited sabotage andinfiltration by agents of white-run South Africa as a continuingthreat to national security.   He said the government expected ``hostile activities'' by SouthAfrica against its black-governed neighbors to increase afterindependence elections in Namibia in November scheduled to endSouth African control over the southwest African territory.   In the past, South Africa has mounted several attacks inZimbabwe against facilities of the African National Congress, themain guerrilla organization fighting the government in Pretoria.   ``That regime (in South Africa) always blames us whenever thereis an uprising in their country,'' Mahachi told legislators.   Since the last renewal of the emergency in January, there was a``marked increase'' in cross-border attacks by rebels inneighboring Mozambique, he said, as well as what he described as``counterrevolutionary and anti-social activities'' in Zimbabweitself.   About 80 Zimbabweans were slain by Mozambique NationalResistance rebels who were also blamed for 78 abductions, 14clashes against troops and 72 armed robberies, Mahachi said.   Zimbabwe has been under a state of emergency since 1965, when itwas introduced by the government of former Rhodesian prime ministerIan Smith to crack down on black nationalists.   The emergency, which has been renewed by parliament every sixmonths since independence in 1980, allows for detention withouttrial.   On Tuesday, one outspoken legislator was prevented on proceduralgrounds from listing 50 alleged abuses of the state of emergencysince 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
