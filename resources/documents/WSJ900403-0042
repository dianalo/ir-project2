Mr. Ryan, a Washington labor and pension lawyer, wasnominated last month to be director of the Office of ThriftSupervision. The Senate Banking Committee approved thenomination by an 11-10 vote last week and sent it to the fullSenate for consideration.</LP><TEXT>   Some senators have complained that Mr. Ryan lacksfinancial experience, but the administration has argued thatthe nominee must be confirmed quickly. A federal court rulingcould bring the savings-and-loan restructuring to a haltunless the Senate promptly confirms a new director for thethrift office. An appeals court stay has put the federalcourt ruling on hold until April 11.   Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have drafted aone-page bill that would give the president the authority toappoint a temporary replacement. Sen. Donald Riegle (D.,Mich.) outlined the proposal as one option that may bepursued. The bill would allow the president to name atemporary director under procedures that would pass musterwith the court, and the administration would have more timeto seek another candidate for the full five-year term.   The administration also has argued that Mr. Ryan'sfinancial background isn't as important as his record as anable administrator and strong enforcer during his time withthe Labor Department. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady hasasked the Senate to &quot;trust his judgment&quot; on his selection ofMr. Ryan and continued calling on senators to push for thenominee.   The narrow basis of the court case hanging over the thriftbailout was that Danny Wall, director of the thrift officeuntil late February, wasn't approved for his post underconstitutional provisions. When he resigned, therefore, theadministration didn't have standing under the Vacancies Actto appoint a temporary replacement.   A floor vote this week appears likely, the administrationand Senate Democrats said. The legislation that Sen. Rieglediscussed wouldn't necessarily have to be approved before thevote, a committee staff member said, as long as senators knewthe bill was in the offing.   Sen. Riegle has hammered away that Mr. Ryan lacks thebackground necessary for the job at a time of crisis in thethrift industry. In a speech to the Independent BankersAssociation of America, Sen. Riegle said he was unhappy aboutthe choice for the &quot;single most important financial positiontoday,&quot; adding that he believes Mr. Ryan would be unqualifiedto be chief executive officer of any of the small banks thetrade group represents.   Disclosures during the weekend that Mr. Ryan briefly triedmarijuana and cocaine in the early 1970s won't help thenominee but aren't likely to be as important a factor in theSenate deliberations, congressional sources said.</TEXT></DOC>
