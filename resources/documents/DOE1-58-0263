<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-58-0263 </DOCNO><TEXT>The invention concerns a process for laying district heating pipes withoutcompensators, where the district heating pipe consists of an inner metalmedium pipe for the district heating medium, an outer metal jacket pipecoaxially surrounding the medium pipe, a large number of radial spacersbetween the medium pipe and the jacket pipe and a large number of counterbearingrings connecting the medium pipe and the jacket pipe together spacedout longitudinally in the district heating pipe, where the medium pipeand the jacket pipe are manufactured by welding together individual sectionsof medium pipe and of jacket pipe and possibly welding the appropriatecounterbearing rings to them and where, after welding one medium pipesection and one jacket pipe section to one counterbearing ring at oneend, the medium pipe section is expanded elastically by heating and themedium pipe section in the expanded state is welded at its other endto the next counterbearing ring and the counterbearing ring is weldedto the appropriate section of jacket pipe. The purpose of the inventionis a district heating pipe which can be laid without compensators. (orig./HAG).</TEXT></DOC>
