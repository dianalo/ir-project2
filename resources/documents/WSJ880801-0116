Never mind that Japan has increased defense expenditures by about 5% a year since 1981. Never mind that by next year Japan will have the third-largest defense budget in the world. The calls for greater Japanese burden-sharing persist.    One would have thought, therefore, that Japan's desire to buy the Aegis battle management system would have played well on Capitol Hill. Aegis would help the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Forces deter a full-scale Soviet naval attack, and it would increase the inter-operability of the U.S. and Japanese navies.    Similarly, Congress has criticized Japan for its failure to open both government procurement and domestic markets to American products. Here again, Aegis would seem to be a welcome response. Each system costs about half-a-billion dollars, and the Japanese navy would like to buy up to eight of them. Although defense sales are not included in trade figures, and so will not result in a reduction in the trade deficit, Aegis sales will create American jobs and contribute to the increased health of the U.S. economy.    Despite the strategic and economic benefits of such a sale, however, some in Congress have sought to block it. A Senate vote is scheduled for this week.    Opponents of Aegis for Japan have argued that we cannot guarantee the military or commercial security of the technology, particularly in the hands of the people who brought us the Toshiba scandal. Yet this objection ignores the following:   --The Japanese Self-Defense Forces have an excellent record in protecting military secrets. In the 30-plus years of U.S.-Japan defense cooperation, there is no evidence that the Japanese military has compromised any American military know-how. The sad truth is that when it comes to security, the Japanese navy's record is better than that of the U.S. Navy.    --The Japanese Self-Defense Forces are not Toshiba. If Toshiba Machine Co. had established even some of the security controls that exist in the Japanese military, the diversion to the Soviet Union of equipment to silence submarine propeller noise would never have occurred.    --The most sensitive part of the Aegis system is the computer software -- the brain that coordinates the radar and fire-control systems. The Japanese will not have access to the source codes to that software. Consequently, even if a Japanese &quot;Red October&quot; defected to the Soviet Union, it would avail our adversaries little to obtain the hardware.    --Although the system theoretically might be reverse-engineered, it would take a major effort. Copying Aegis is not something a rogue engineer could do on weekends. The Japanese government would have to mobilize substantial resources for such a task. Yet the certain crisis in our bilateral relationship that would result from U.S. detection of such an effort makes it virtually inconceivable that Japan would attempt it.    The other argument advanced against the proposed sale is that the administration should have jaw-boned the Japanese into purchasing the hulls on which Aegis will be deployed, as well as the system itself. The Defense Department appropriations bill that the Senate is expected to vote on this week contains an amendment prohibiting the sale of the system unless the Japanese purchase ships as well. However desirable it would be for Japan to buy the hulls here, such a condition would sink the entire sale.    The last time the Japanese navy purchased a foreign-made naval combatant was 1880, 27 years after Admiral Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay. It is extremely doubtful that a century-old tradition will be breached now.    Indeed, the Japanese have made it clear that they will not buy Aegis if the U.S. insists on selling American-built hulls as well. Tokyo can take that position because it has other options. It can, over time, develop its own Aegis. In the interim, it can buy from the Europeans ship-defense systems that, while not as advanced as Aegis, would still enable Japan to upgrade its capabilities.    Those Americans who insist on conditionality for the sake of jobs in our shipbuilding industry are likely to wish they had settled for the bird in hand. It is estimated that one Aegis for Japan will result in 5,400 man-years of U.S. labor, and that U.S.-built Aegis-capable hulls would bring 2,700 more. Thus, for every ship-building job we insist on, we risk losing two jobs in the electronics industry.    Japan is both an ally and a democracy. Its leadership is bucking pacifist public opinion and the imperatives of fiscal austerity to assume a larger burden of the common defense. An effort to squeeze even more out of the Japanese only undermines our own interests and demeans our most important bilateral relationship.    ---   Rep.
