 The problems of handling color oncomputers were solved by Scitex, Crosfield, Hell and Dainippon Screen in thelate 1970s and '80s.andP;  Now the focus has shifted to handling color innon-proprietary &quot;fourth-wave&quot; systems.andM;Color separations can be created with off-the-shelf computers, software andoutput devices.andP;  But the process can be difficult, expensive and slow, andthere are quality issues still to be resolved.andM;In-house separations on fourth-wave systems are beginning to have an impactin the newspaper market, but not yet in other markets.andP;  The obstacles arestill too great.andM;Phases of color-separation use.andP;  In his presentation, Mike Templeman of Aldussummed up the four stages through which he went (and through which all newusers of color separation are apt to go):andM;* Unbounded (and unwarranted) enthusiasmandM;* Deep confusionandM;* Deeper depressionandM;* Guarded optimismandM;Having reached the fourth stage, Templeman was in a position to describe boththe potential and the pitfalls of color separation on desktop platforms.andP;  Hispresentation alerted would-be desktop separators in the audience to some keyareas of potential difficulty.andM;* Scanner performance.andP;  High-quality desktop scanners such as the Nikon,Array and new Howtek models can take 10 minutes to make a scan.andP;  There can bea bottleneck at the scanner, especially if re-scans are necessary.andM;* Network performance.andP;  Templeman moved files on Aldus internal localnetworks to test performance.andP;  The test file was 4 MB in size--notparticularly large as color images go.andP;  On LocalTalk, the file took 3 minutesto move from one machine to another in the middle of the night, 6 minutesduring the day when other network activity was happening.andP;  Switching toEthernet reduced the times, but only fractionally.andP;  The nighttime transfertook 1-2/3 minutes, and the day-time one took 4-1/2 minutes on Ethernet.andO;Clearly, network bottlenecks are a real possibility.andM;* Halftoning performance.andP;  PostScript imagers can be a bottleneck too.andO;Halftoning a 5-MB file took 20 to 30 minutes on various Linotype andVarityper devices and 85 minutes on a Compugraphic 9600.andM;* Scanner quality.andP;  Desktop scanners are getting better, but they still havetheir limitations.andP;  These include lack of dynamic range (resulting inflat-looking scans), limited color gamut (resulting in some similar colorsbeing recorded as identical), and improper handling of metameric colors(resulting in some colors the eye sees as identical being recorded asdifferent).andP;  There is still no accepted standard for how colors should berepresented on the computer, so different scanners provide different (butequally valid) data for the same image.andM;* Halftoning quality.andP;  Researchers are still experimenting with screenangles, resolutions and spot functions to provide good results and eliminatemoire.andP;  Questions about the applicability of Hell's halftone patents remain.andO;The new generation of machines is less likely to show the banding problemsthat have plagued some imagesetters.andM;* Halftone calibration.andP;  The output device must be calibrated faithfully atleast once a day, and changes must be compensated for.andP;  This process involvesreading test films with a densitometer.andP;  In one case, an L-300 produced 6-15%larger dots before calibration than it should have, based on the requestedscreen density in the test file.andP;  Similar problems occur with other devices.andM;Templeman emphasized the need for training and for easy-to-use colorsoftware.andM;But is this really desktop publishing?andP;  No, answers Templeman, this isprofessional publishing using desktop tools.andP;  The cost ($100,000 to $150,000for a color setup), the training and personnel needed, and the attention todetails such as calibration mean that the causal user--key to the success ofblack-and-white desktop publishing--is not going to be involved with colorseparation.andM;Color without separations.andP;  Templeman's presentation touched briefly on oneadditional area that may become important long before desktopcolor-separation technology is widely used.andP;  It is the reproduction of colorusing a copier rather than an offset press.andP;  Of course a copier cannot rivala press in quality, and the economics of using a copier are unattractive ifquantities rise above a few hundred.andP;  But for small quantities, color copiersmay be attractive.andP;  Templeman called this area &quot;office color.&quot;andM;With a color copier, you need a color original.andP;  This can be produced by oneof the color printers commonly used for desktop proofing.andP;  If color printersbecome fast enough and cheap enough, the color copier may not be needed.andO;Each &quot;copy&quot; can be produced directly on the printer.andM;Templeman's presentation outlined the basic themes that dominated most of thediscussion of color.andP;  It is probably a sign of industry maturation that fewpresenters could be placed in either of his first two phases (unboundedenthusiasm and deep confusion).andP;  Both of the other stages (deep depressionand guarded optimism) were well represented, however.andM;Quality issuesandM;The deepest depression registered on the color issue was expressed in RayHammond's presentation.andP;  Hammond has concluded that widespread production ofdesktop color separations simply will not happen, at least not in Europe.andO;The reason lies in who the user of the system is.andM;John-in-the-box.andP;  Hammond wryly described how he had returned to England fromthe Seybold Seminars a year ago, full of excitement about the potential ofdesktop color.andP;  He had set up a desktop color system in rented space inside aconventional color house.andP;  He had an arrangement with his landlord for theexchange of information and expertise.andM;Hammond came to realize that there was one missing element in his system thattechnological advances could not cure.andP;  It was the expertise embodied in&quot;John,&quot; the operator of the conventional color scanner in the neighboringcolor shop.andM;John knew how to evaluate transparencies and see exactly how they had to beadjusted in the scanning process.andP;  He could take several poorly shot candidsof movie stars stepping out of limousines and make them look reasonablybalanced when printed together on a page.andP;  He could make colors in the firstpicture of a soccer match (taken in sunlight by a clear-headed photographer)look like those of the last one (taken later in the day, under lights andafter a few beers).andP;  He knew how to make fleshtones look like fleshtones(even when they didn't in the original photo) and he could make theadjustment without turning the grass blue.andM;All of these areas were problems for Hammond's desktop group.andP;  But theproblems weren't with equipment.andP;  When John tried his hand at the desktopequipment, things came out fine.andP;  The problem was that the desktop grouplacked John's experience and his eye for color.andP;  John had developed thesequalities through long apprenticeship and he was well compensated for hiscraft.andP;  What was needed on the desktop was a &quot;John-in-the-box,&quot; a magicalsource of built-in color craft knowledge.andM;Alas, a John-in-the-box is not offered, even as an option, on any desktopsystems; and it doesn't seem likely that it ever will be.andP;  Hammond decided toabandon the desktop approach and to offer customers the Scitex Visionarysystem instead.andM;Other quality issues.andP;  While John's expertise is hard to duplicate, otherquality problems are more amenable to technical solutions.andP;  A few speakersnoted progress on several fronts.andM;Scanners are improving rapidly.andP;  At the high end of desktop (or is it the lowend of professional?) scanning is the new $70,000 Optronics ColorGetter,introduced at the seminar (see Optronics, below).andP;  Other scanners are beingimproved.andM;In particular, flatbed vendors are working to extend the dynamic range oftheir machines.andP;  The most straightforward way to interface CCD arrays withdigital electronics, used in first-generation flatbeds, lacks range.andO;Voltages collected by the CCDs are converted directly to 24-bit color values,but a lot of color data are lost in conversion.andP;  This problem is being fixedby taking multiple readings (Array), by preadjusting the voltages beforedigital conversion (Howtek), or by converting the voltages at higherprecision (36 bits/pixel) and then converting this high-precision data to 24bits in a way that preserves as much data as possible (Sharp).andM;On the output side, quality questions have focused on moire problems inPostScript devices and on the accuracy and repeatability of roller-fedmachines (which includes most imagesetters).andP;  The moire problem is beingaddressed with careful selection of screen angles and frequencies, and itwill probably go away in due course.andM;With these machines, both the mechanics of the roller mechanism and thepossibility of slight stretching of the film during imaging can createproblems.andP;  In his presentation on newspaper color, Richard Dannenberg ofBidco described how his company is addressing these issues with the use of a&quot;stability platen&quot; that maintains an even tension over the width of the filmand with special types of film engineered not to stretch.andM;We can expect technical improvements from the other vendors of roll-fedmachines as well.andM;Performance issuesandM;Performance--how quickly things get done--has not been a priority in thedesktop world.andP;  Getting functionality into the software (and onto the specsheet, though not always in that sequence) has been the focus for mostvendors.andP;  For many features, implementation efficiency is not too critical,especially for the casual user.andM;With color, however, efficiency looms large.andP;  Text files are measured in tensof kilobytes, and an extra second per kilobyte for a text function (such assearching or justifying text) results in only a few seconds of delay.andP;  Colorimage files, on the other hand, can be tens of megabytes.andP;  When processingsuch a file, an extra second per kilobyte can mean several extra hours ofcompute time.andP;  Even the most casual user would balk at that!andM;Compression.andP;  File compression is the first line of defense against hugefiles.andP;  One company that has been working with compression of color files isElectronics for Imaging (EFI).andP;  Compression is one of the topics that companypresident Efi Arazi discussed in his presentation.andP;  EFI will providecompression software to work with compression chips and boards as they becomeavailable.andM;The first such chip, from C-Cube Microsystems, has just become available.andO;C-Cube cofounder Adriaan Ligtenberg talked in his presentation about themethod of compression used by the chip.andM;The chip adheres to a new standard (not yet formally adopted, but close)called JPEG.andP;  This approach uses the compression method called &quot;discretecosine transform&quot; to remove much of the redundant data from a color image.andO;The changes are calculated to be difficult for the eye to detect.andP;  (A summaryof the approach appeared in Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  1.)andP;  It works on blocks of animage, 8 pixels square.andM;The JPEG approach can result in compressions between 10X and 20X withoutsignificant visual change.andP;  But the time required for a program to compress afile is excessive for most applications.andP;  That is why the C-Cube chip isimportant: it permits very rapid compression and decompression of an image,typically in a second or two.andM;With chips like this, plus some standards for how compressed files should bestored, it will be possible to store large image files on floppies, to movethem around on networks, and to transmit them over telephone lines withoutthe performance penalties these steps now entail.andM;Compression will not affect times for most image manipulation operations,however, because the files will have to be decompressed before themanipulations can be performed.andP;  Speed improvements in computers and programsfor displaying and manipulating images will still be needed.andM;Ligtenberg (who left C-Cube in December to form an independent company)believes that there are a number of tricks that can be played within the JPEGstandard that will be of particular help for high-resolution publishingapplications.andM;One of these tricks will be to compress different parts of the image bydifferent amounts: lower compression ratios (and hence less quality loss) forareas that contain critical subject elements, higher compression ratios forimage portions that contain less important elements.andM;Ligtenberg noted that even better compression processes will eventuallyappear.andP;  It will be a while, however, before they are standardized andincorporated into chips.andM;PostScript performance.andP;  An example of a type of manipulation that can't behelped by compression is image halftoning.andP;  This is the step that makesPostScript output slow, and it is being addressed by new and faster hardware.andO;Constant speed improvements are being made, as evidenced by the benchmarks wepublish periodically on various PostScript machines.andM;PostScript timings are just one part of a more complicated output picture.andO;This picture was described vividly by Ed Lehr of the St. Paul Pioneer PressDispatch.andP;  Lehr set out to find a PostScript device that could match theimaging speed of his Hell 299 drum scanner: a set of four broadsheet-sizeseparation films (not including text) in 30 minutes.andM;This challenge proved to be difficult.andP;  An initial benchmark test, with afairly simple page, included Linotype L-300s with two different RIPs, aMonotype unit, and a Hyphen RIP driving an ECRM PelBox.andP;  None of them wasfast enough, but the Hyphen, running in a Mac II, seemed promising.andP;  In fact,after some performance fixes were installed, the Hyphen RIP was able tohandle the page in 20 minutes.andM;The result was promising enough that a second test was conducted, this timewith 14 MB of images on a broadsheet page.andP;  The Hyphen RIP, with a time of30:47 for the page, could not quite achieve the required standard.andP;  Addingmemory (to 8 MB) improved things, but not enough; the time: 30:27.andM;A breakthrough came when a Mac IIx was substituted for the Mac II.andP;  Theresulting 15% performance improvement brought the elapsed time well under the30-minute requirement.andP;  The performance improvement seemed to be due not toimproved RIP speed, but rather to faster AppleTalk transfers.andP;  This findingwas a surprise, since the IIx is not supposed to handle AppleTalk differentlythan the II.andM;The Pioneer Press Dispatch is now running four pages a week of PostScriptcolor.andP;  Front pages of sections such as Business, Health andamp; Fitness, Money andEntertainment are assembled in Quark Xpress.andP;  By running them as fullPostScript pages, the paper can incorporate art from MacDraw, Illustrator andFreeHand.andP;  Separations are handled by PrePress Technology's SpectreMatch andSpectrePrint software.andM;An unanticipated dividend is improved black-and-white halftones.andP;  These hadbeen handled as screened positives, pasted in and shot as line art along withthe type.andP;  Now they are part of the negative; the result is better halftonedots on the plate.andM;Making color easier to useandM;Color for the &quot;lay tech&quot; user.andP;  Earlier, Efi Arazi had set the stage for theweek's color discussion with a vision of where color technology and colorreproduction is heading.andP;  He traced the evolution of typesetting and drew aparallel to what he expects to see happen for color reproduction.andM;Handset and hot-metal type was the domain of craftsmen.andP;  This was the &quot;craft&quot;phase of the industry.andP;  Then, computer-based composition systems drivingphototypesetters and digital typesetters made it possible for technicians toset type without the benefit of the full craft training, bringing about the&quot;technician&quot; phase.andP;  Finally, desktop publishing made type accessible to laypeople with a just a little technical knowledge--what Efi calls the &quot;laytech&quot; phase.andM;He believes that color is progressing along the same path.andP;  Cameraseparations and drum scanners represented the &quot;craft&quot; phase, which is nowcoming to an end.andP;  The &quot;technician&quot; phase began with theScitex/Crosfield/Hell systems and continues with the current crop of desktopcolor separation packages.andP;  We are still waiting for the systems that willsupport the &quot;lay tech&quot; phase.andM;How do we get there?andP;  To break the lay barrier, Arazi feels that we needseveral technology advances:andM;* Image compression, to reduce the cost of the hardware required to store andtransmit huge color image files.andM;* True device-independent color portability, so that users can be confidentthat the color they see on one device predictably approximates the color theywill get off another device.andM;* Lay tech tools, building craft skills into the system so that users do notneed to possess those skills themselves.andM;* Improvements in hardware, especially in PostScript output screening.andM;There was wide agreement with both the lay tech objective and statement ofwhat needs to happen to get us to this goal.andP;  But there was also wideagreement that we are not yet there.andP;  As evidenced by the otherpresentations, desktop color production is still very much in the &quot;craftsman&quot;phase.andM;Color portability.andP;  As we have noted before, an essential prerequisite for aheterogeneous multivendor color production system is a system- anddevice-independent means of specifying color.andP;  The logical way to accomplishthis is to agree on a standard color space, then develop ways to calibrateall relevant devices to this independent standard.andM;Efi showed pictures of impressive examples of this &quot;color portability&quot; overtwo display screens (a $2,000 Sony monitor and a $6,000 Barco monitor) and awide variety of printers.andP;  Although one of the monitors (ironically theBarco, although Efi did not say this) completely washed out when the roomlights were turned on, the results were, in general, impressive.andM;Which color space?andP;  Jacob Aizikowitz, also of EFI, expanded on this themewith a closer look at the various device-independent color spaces.andP;  These arebased on the way the human eye perceives color, rather than the way color isscanned by an input scanner or rendered by a particular output device.andM;The basis for device-independent color was created by a series of colorexperiments in the years after World War I.andP;  These experiments, conducted bythe international commission on illumination (Commission Internationale del'Eclairage, or CIE), led to the notion of a &quot;standard observer&quot;--actuallythe average of a number of test subjects--whose color vision could bedescribed in terms of the spectral sensitivity of the red, green, and bluereceptors in his eyes.andM;Using the CIE standard, colors can be specified using three numbers.andP;  In theinitial CIE scheme, however, it was not possible to tell from these numbershow similar two colors were.andP;  The system lacked &quot;perceptual uniformity.&quot;andO;Later systems, including CIELAB and CIELUV, correct this shortcoming and canbe used to create perceptually based color image files.andM;Scanners could be calibrated to produce image files that are coded in thisdevice-independent, visually based way.andP;  Any properly calibrated monitor oroutput device could then render the image without knowledge of its source.andO;That would be portable color.andM;To date there is no standard for this type of portable image file.andP;  One isbadly needed.andM;In response to a question, Aizikowitz acknowledged that the RGB color space,used now in a nonstandard way by scanners and monitors, could be carefullydefined and tied to the CIE standards.andP;  An RGB standard is appealing becauseit would be immediately displayable on a CRT.andP;  If the CRT conformed exactlyto the standardized RGB, the display would be accurate.andP;  But an RGB colorspace has the disadvantage (like the original CIE space) of not beingperceptually uniform.andP;  This means that if you wanted to do accurate colorchanges on the monitor, the calculational burden imposed on the user wouldnegate the value of the simplicity sought by using RGB.andM;Color printersandM;Color printers are coming to market in ever-increasing numbers.andP;  Performanceis improving and prices are dropping.andP;  A broard range of products isavailable.andM;At one end are very expensive printers with large formats and high-qualitycolor.andP;  These machines, with price tags from $50,000 to several times that,are beginning to be good enough to displace some proofing work that wouldotherwise be done using proofing processes like Chromalin that depend on thecreation of a set of negatives.andP;  At the other end of the scale are slow,under-$10,000 machines whose job is to produce an initial proof for designreview or (in some applications) as a master for a short run of color-copierprints.andM;David Spencer, of Spencer and Associates, reviewed some of the conclusions hehad drawn from a recent study of 15 of these devices.andP;  He tested them withtext and line art as well as continuous-tone color images.andP;  The test groupincluded printers from Seiko, Tektronix, Howtek, Canon, Iris and Du Pont aswell as still-in-test machines from Panasonic, Colorocs, Oce and Kodak.andM;The results showed a reasonably steady improvement in quality in moving frominexpensive low-resolution machines to expensive, higher-resolution ones.andP;  Animportant finding: dot variability at a coarse resolution can give bettercontone results than fixed dots at higher resolution.andP;  For example, thePanasonic printer, with only 160 pixels per inch but four bits of data perpixel, did much better on contones than a 300-pixel-per-inch, fixed-pixelprinter.andM;Spencer concluded that there were no clear winners: you basically get whatyou pay for with these machines.andP;  Don't overlook the role of the RIP indetermining quality, he emphasized.andP;  It can be as important as the markingengine for some types of images.andM;Spencer did not assess the variability of these machines over time.andP;  He didget a run of 25 prints off of each one, and these showed little variability.andM;Spencer also mentioned three interesting new printers that should appearsoon.andP;  They are: a Mitsubishi machine based on dye sublimation, a Honeywelldry-silver color printer, and a Dainippon Screen printer using the MeadCycolor process.andP;  The latter is a 300-dpi, 8-bit-per-pixel machine.andM;Mills Davis, of Davis Inc., discussed a somewhat similar review he isundertaking.andP;  He has assembled a number of devices and programs dealing withcolor and is beginning to evaluate them.andP;  He will test various &quot;pre-presslinks&quot; with service bureaus.andP;  File exchange is via 45-MB Bernoullicartridges, since phone lines are too slow for really large files.andM;The new color systemsandM;Just as Print 80 ushered in Scitex and its competitors a decade ago, it looksas if Drupa '90 in late April will mark the beginning of a new generation ofsystems.andP;  They aim to stake out a territory between the large dedicatedsystems and the small desktop ones.andP;  Whether these new systems will age asgracefully over the next ten years as their predecessors have over the lastten remains to be seen.andM;Linotype.andP;  In recent years, Linotype has become increasingly output-oriented.andO;This is especially true in North America, where the success of the LinotypePostScript output devices has overshadowed everything else the company hasdone.andM;Linotype wants to reverse this situation with a new series of products beingreadied for Drupa.andP;  The products will combine some Linotype elements withmany off-the-shelf pieces, both hardware and software.andM;The Linotype approach, as described by Erwin Konigs at the seminar, willinvolve Macintoshes networked to a Unix file server.andP;  The Macs will run someoff-the-shelf software--ColorStudio and Photoshop were mentionedspecifically--but Linotype will provide production software, file managementand cabling, as well as input and output peripherals.andM;The workstations will be Macintosh IIx's with a RISC-based coprocessor forimage processing.andP;  They will be equipped with lots of memory (16 MB or 32 MB)so that large images can be held entirely in RAM.andM;Peripherals will include a new imagesetter, the LTC 300, and new flatbed CCDscanners.andP;  The scanners will handle opaque art at up to 600 dpi and slides atup to 2,000 dpi.andP;  They will collect data at 12 bits per color (or 36 bits perpixel) instead of the common 8 (or 24) bits.andM;The system will be built around a device-independent, CIE-based color spaceto which each peripheral is calibrated.andP;  Image files will be stored,compressed, in this color space.andP;  Linotype will supply the output separationsoftware, which will convert files from the system color space into CMYKdata.andP;  The software will be able to be tailored to various print processes.andO;It will support UCR and GCR.andM;Detailed pricing must wait for Drupa, but a full-blown two-user system shouldcost in the neighborhood of $200,000.andM;Agfa Compugraphic.andP;  Agfa outlined a system that is in many ways similar.andP;  Ittoo has a Unix file server, supporting both Macintoshes (primarily fordesign) and Sun workstations (for production).andM;But there are important differences too.andP;  Lee Silverman, presenting Agfa'sapproach, emphasized that the company wanted to offer a full system, not aset of independent but linked products.andP;  Agfa prefers to provide a totalsystem, then take total responsibility in areas such as training users andservicing and calibrating the equipment.andM;Silverman noted that his company's system will use as its internal colorstandard &quot;companded RGB&quot;--a version of the RGB color space that has beenadjusted to match the output gamut of the printing process.andM;Agfa has a new approach to halftone screening in the works, but Silverman didnot elaborate on it.andM;No detailed pricing was provided, but Silverman estimated that a minimumsingle-user system would be priced around $100,000.andM;Gems.andP;  Alan Gibson represented a relatively new vendor, Gems of Cambridge,Ltd., from England.andP;  Gibson talked about the changing roles of production andeditorial processes as new color systems are introduced to newspapers.andM;Gibson sees editorial users taking a much bigger role in production of colorimages, just as they have in typesetting and page layout.andP;  There willcontinue to be a place for production experts, but they will gradually moveinto a quality-assurance role, with editorial users doing the actual imagemanipulation, he said.andM;Newspapers will want to do more of their own integration of new elements intotheir existing environments, according to Gibson.andP;  That will give them morecontrol over their own destinies than if they leave this task to theirsupplier of choice.andM;Gibson briefly described his company's product, which is color prepresssoftware running on a Unix workstation (a Sun Sparcstation).andP;  The product isdescribed in the equipment section of this issue.andP;  With a scanner, butwithout an output device, the single-user version costs about $60,000.andM;Optronics.andP;  Optronics, which makes input scanners, output recorders andassociated software, is looking for a niche between the high-end systems andthe imagesetters and scanners used in today's service bureaus.andP;  The companyoffers a film recorder (the ColorSetter) and a scanner (the ColorGetter).andO;The latter was introduced at the seminar and is described in the equipmentcoverage section.andP;  Both are based on the traditional spinning-drumtechnology.andM;Terry Wellman of Optronics discussed his company's view of the color market.andO;He emphasized the need for handling color in absolute, CIE-based terms, notdevice-dependent ones.andP;  This is what Optronics's own software does.andM;Optronics is looking for VARs that would be interested in handling itsproducts.andM;Crosfield.andP;  The high-end vendors are not resting on their laurels.andP;  BrianJordan described Crosfield's approach and discussed some of the new itemsthat will be shown at Drupa.andM;He began by noting why color was difficult to master.andP;  It has high qualityrequirements, and poor quality is easily spotted.andP;  (Poor quality is lessnoticeable and more acceptable with black-and-white, Jordan asserted.)andO;Calibration and experience level are both important factors in color quality.andM;Jordan also noted the performance problems that come with large file sizes.andO;And there are a number of new functions required that don't have a monochromecounterpart.andP;  He mentioned specifically chokes and spreads (known as &quot;grip&quot;in the UK) and press registration problems.andM;Cost can be a problem with color too.andP;  But in a production environment,Jordan noted, it is not so much cost itself as the cost/performance ratiothat matters.andP;  In other words: how many pages per hour do I get for each$100,000 of investment?andP;  Only when systems are viewed in this way, and whenproper allowance is made for rework time on pages that weren't quite rightthe first time, can a comparative cost judgment be made.andM;At Drupa, Crosfield will emphasize enhancements to its 9500 workstation.andO;This machine, introduced primarily as a stripping station, will get fullretouching at Drupa.andP;  There will also be an optional package (StudioFill) forflood-filling black-and-white line art, such as cartoons.andP;  It will be joinedby the 9600, a RISC-based workstation that runs all the 9500 software, butfaster; and the 9700, a design-and-paint workstation whose primary outputwill be high-resolution transparencies.andM;In response to a question, Jordan said that Crosfield is not movingdown-market; it is concentrating on improving the productivity of itsexisting products.andP;  The company is not yet ready to tie its systems closelyto Macintoshes in such a way that accurate color can be seen on the Macintoshscreen.andP;  That step will wait for better standards for color on the desktop.andM;Where is color going?andM;No clear direction for color emerged from the seminar.andP;  For now, it seems,there are opportunities for everyone.andP;  Some people will focus on improvingthe quality and ease of use of the desktop systems.andP;  Others will work on theefficiency of the high-end systems.andP;  Several pioneering efforts will seek tocarve out niches between the high end and the desktop.andP;  Still others willseek their fortunes in a market that doesn't yet exist: color reproductionbased solely on printers and color copiers.andM;The end-user will be left with many choices to make.andP;  Should I take on colormyself with a desktop system?andP;  Should I choose one of the new mid-rangesystems from a company such as Agfa or Linotype?andP;  Or should I interface toone of the high-end systems?andM;At the trade shows, all these options and many more will be loudly promoted.andO;But one additional option deserves quiet and careful consideration.andP;  It won'tbe promoted at Drupa, and it was hardly mentioned at these future-orientedseminars.andP;  It is the conventional separation and stripping process.andM;Conventional separation and stripping for contone color images, when combinedwith full-page PostScript output of text and line work, can be a veryattractive option.andP;  For most color pages--jobs that do not involve retouchingor fancy overlapping of contone images and tints--this approach can providehigh quality at a cost that is often lower and a speed that is often fasterthan the all-electronic options can offer.andP;  Eventually, this situation willchange and electronic systems will have all the advantages.andP;  But for now,many applications are still well served by a hybrid approach: filmseparations for the contones and PostScript output for the rest.andM;Where do we go from here?andP;  The March Seminars were also the setting for thesecond user/vendor &quot;summit meeting&quot; sponsored by Aldus and moderated by PaulBrainerd and Jonathan Seybold.andP;  (The first &quot;summit&quot; was held at the ComputerPublishing Conference in September.)andM;The purpose of the meetings has been to identify issues that need to beaddressed by cooperative action and to encourage the interested parties toresolve these issues through informal dialog and cooperation.andP;  Two of theissues discussed in this meeting related directly to color: data compressionand device-independent color spaces.andM;A task force led by EFI has been formed to review the JPEG standard to makecertain that it is adequate for the requirements of large, high-resolutioncolor images.andM;Companies interested in device-independent color agreed to work with Adobe(which already had a draft effort under way in this direction) to reachconsensus on which standards to support.andP;  (We expect that the decision willbe to support normalized RGB, plus either CIELUV or CIELAB.andP;  The generalfeeling was that the differences between CIELUV and CIELAB, in particular,were less important than the need to rally a critical mass of vendors behinda single standard.)andP;  We left the meeting optimistic that such an agreementcan be reached relatively soon.andP;  The will is clearly there.andP;  The technicalissues are well understood.andP;  The need is pressing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
