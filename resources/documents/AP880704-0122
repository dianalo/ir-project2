In one of a series of resolutions adopted at last week's partyconference, the delegates said any citizen attacked in the pressshould have the right to respond in the same newspaper.   The Soviet press also must not publish ``unobjective informationinjurious to a citizen's honor and dignity,'' Tass said insummarizing the resolutions.   The national conference, the party's first since 1941, wascalled by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to chart political reforms andreassess the role of the 20 million-member party in Soviet life.   As well as setting certain limits for the Kremlin policy of``glasnost,'' or openness, the 5,000-member conference decreed asweeping agenda of political and legal reform.   The Central Committee, the party's policy-making body, will meetat the end of July to discuss how to put the conference'sresolutions into effect, Tass said.   Further indicating the speed with which the Soviet leadershipwants to move, the Politburo, the party's supreme body, held anextraordinary Monday session to discuss how to fulfill theresolutions.   The 13-member body led by Gorbachev ordered all party andgovernment bodies to ``act without delay'' in implementing thedecisions of the conference, which ended Friday.   Gorbachev, the party's general secretary, has repeatedly saidpast efforts at reform failed because they were not accomplished bypolitical changes.   As summarized by Tass, the party conference's resolutions:   _ State that more openness ``is an indispensable condition forunfolding the processes of democratizing every aspect of life andupdating socialism.'' But they say the press is not free to act``to the detriment of the interests of the Soviet state andsociety.''   _ Acknowledge that Gorbachev's program for political and socialrestructuring, known as ``perestroika,'' is proceeding more slowlythan planned. ``Many causes of all this are to be sought in theflaws of the present work of the party, government and economicbodies and public organizations.''   _ Attach ``prime importance to improving drastically foodsupplies to the population.'' The shortest route to that goal, theconference said, is for bureaucrats to stop meddling in theoperations of collective and state farms.   _ Give ``top priority'' to sweeping political reform, includinga 10-year limit on the tenure of elected party and governmentofficials and a reinforced role for the governing councils, whooften were supplanted in practice by local party committees.   Party officials have said the political changes include thecreation of a full-time legislature and of a more powerfulpresidency that could be filled by the 57-year-old Gorbachevhimself.   Other resolutions adopted include instructions on fightingbureaucracy, reforming the legal system and changing the apparatusof the party.   The delegates to the four-day conference rejected the legacy oftotalitarian methods bequeathed by dictator Josef Stalin, and alsorepudiated the complacency and corruption now viewed as endemicunder the reign of President Leonid I. Brezhnev.   The party, the resolutions said, ``shall never allow therepetition of anything similar to what is associated with theperiods of the cult of personality and stagnation, which causedprofound deformations in socialist society, retarded itsdevelopment for whole decades and brought about immense humancasualties and immeasurable moral and ideological losses.''   In a further break with Stalin's legacy, the Politburo on Mondayapproved the construction of a monument in Moscow to the victims of``illegality and repression'' during the 29 years Stalin led thenation.   Gorbachev had proposed at the conference that such a memorial bebuilt, and said Friday: ``This would be an honest step, and it willbe supported by the entire Soviet people.''   At the conference, some delegates had called for publication ofthe responsibilities of members of the party hierarchy, which untilnow had not been mentioned by state-run media.   The communique on Monday's Politburo meeting, distributed byTass, spelled out for the first time which leaders had been chargedwith specific tasks by the ruling body.   Apparently heeding some delegates' complaints that food supplieswere wholly inadequate in some regions, the Politburo directedPremier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, fellow Politburo member Viktor P.Nikonov and other officials to improve food production and supply.</TEXT></DOC>
