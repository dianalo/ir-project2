The alarm will be converted into IBM's Network Management VectorTransport format and forwarded to NetView by a Systems Services ControlPoint-to-physical unit session.andM;Previously, NetView could send SNA management information to the Integratorvia Systems Center Inc.'s Net/Master.andP;  The Integrator, however, could notsend alerts to NetView.andM;Finally, a remote command facility will let NetView users query theIntegrator.andP;  The commands can be issued from the NetView station, or can bedefined as subscripts in a NetView program and run automatically when analarm is sent.andP;  Again, data exchange is via Systems Services ControlPoint-to-physical unit session.andP;  To ensure compatibility with IBM and ATandamp;T'sinstalled product base, the new software will use existing interfaces.andP;  Thisdecision also means users will see the products soon.andP;  However, futureimplementations will conform to OSI standards.andP;  IBM will make its newsoftware available for NetView Version 1 Release 3 and higher in the firsthalf of 1992.andP;  ATandamp;T will make its new software available for AccumasterIntegrator Release 2 at the same time.andP;  ATandamp;T will offer its software as aseparate product; IBM declined to comment on the packaging of its software.andM;Under the agreement with HP, IBM is licensing HP OpenView Network NodeManager and Network Management Server.andP;  The SNMP-based Network Node Managerlets a network administrator manage a TCP/IP network from a singleworkstation.andP;  The Network Management Server is a set of OSI and CMIP APIs forthe Node Manager.andM;IBM plans to use HP's technologies in a NetView management product for AIX-and Unix-based network environments.andP;  Currently, the company is evaluatingwhich pieces of the licensed HP technology to use.andP;  An AIX NetView productwill be available within a year, according to Bill Warner, IBM'scommunication systems director of network management.andM;Looking to capitalize on growth in the personal computer-based LAN market,Digital Equipment Corp. has introduced the Desktop Interconnect Family.andP;  Thenew line features two repeaters, a terminal server, and a bridge that canstand alone when used with an optional power supply.andP;  As the number ofworkgroup users grows, these units can be plugged into DEC's new eight-slothub backplane.andM;DEC is already the number one LAN vendor with a 19-percent market share inrevenue,&quot; says Brad Baldwin, program director at the Gartner Group, a marketresearch consulting firm.andP;  DEC's strength lies in host connectivity andterminal servers, but the company has been weak in the workgroup area,according to Baldwin.andP;  The Desktop Interconnect Family attempts to remedythis shortcoming.andM;The DEC repeater 90C and 90T provide six coaxial and eight twisted-pairports, respectively.andP;  The repeaters retime, amplify, and repeat all incomingsignals.andP;  They automatically detect cable faults and isolate the faulty portfrom the rest of the LAN.andP;  The repeaters measure 11.0 x 5.5 x 1.4 inches andweigh approximately three pounds, as do the bridge and terminal server.andO;DEC's terminal server, the eight-port DECserver 90L, supports terminal andprinter speeds up to 38.4 Kbits/sec via DEC's Local Area Transport protocol.andM;While the ability to work in either stand-alone or hub-based mode issignificant for the whole line, it's essential for the terminal server, saysBaldwin.andP;  &quot;By 1995, 48 percent of terminal ports shipped will be part of anintelligent wiring platform and stand-alone terminal server ports will be onthe decline.' With a 38-percent market share of terminal server portshipments, DEC is moving to retain and enhance its standing, notes Baldwin.andM;The DECbridge 90 supports up to 200 users within a workgroup.andP;  It featuresSpanning Tree Protocol and traffic and protocol filtering to isolate usersfrom the larger network.andP;  The unit forwards packets at 14,847 frames/sec andfilters at 29,694 frames/sec.andP;  Network addresses are learned automatically.andM;DEC engineers used a single table architecture in the bridge to reduce thenumber of integrated circuits and increase the table-lookup speed.andP;  Users canmanage the bridge from any DECnet node that supports the MaintenanceOperation Protocol/ Console Carrier protocol.andP;  DEC plans to add SNMPmanagement capabilities by fall and Enterprise Management Architecturecompatibility by year end.andM;As workgroups grow, the DEChub 90 can be configured with terminal servers,repeaters, and a bridge.andP;  The hub provides power and a single managementpoint for eight individual modules.andP;  Modules can be installed and removedwithout disturbing the network.andP;  Users can mount the hub on a wall or in arack.andP;  The DECrepeater 90C and 90T retail for $1,590.andP;  The DECserver 90Lcosts $1,450.andP;  The DECbridge 90 is $2,890, and the DEChub 90 is $890.andP;  Allunits are available now.andM;Banyan Systems inc. recently unveiled VINES Version 4.10, which featuressupport for network clients running Microsoft Windows 3.0 and OS/2.andP;  At thesame time, Banyan announced an enhanced Applications Toolkit supportingdevelopers of Windows, OS/2, DOS, and Unix applications.andM;The toolkit offers two new sets of APIs, in addition to those available inthe Version 4.0 toolkit.andP;  Mail Client is an API set for developingapplications that communicate with the VINES mail transport mechanism.andP;  TheBanyan mail environment is built on and integrated with StreetTalk,VINES'global directory service.andP;  The second set of APIS, VINES Network andSystem Management (VNSM), lets developers create network monitoring andmanagement applications.andM;VINES Version 4.10 supports OS/2 APIs.andP;  The most popular of these, namedpipes, is supported in the Windows, OS/2, and DOS environments.andP;  As a result,Windows and DOS workstations can access an OS/2-based application server(such as Microsoft's SQL Server) and share the distributed database with eachother and with OS/2 workstations.andP;  All VINES-specific APIs are now availableas Dynamic Link Libraries for Windows and OS/2.andP;  The new DLIs are acollection of common, shared program functions that can be referencedsimultaneously by the operating system and by multiple applications.andP;  Theyprovide a direct interface to VIM services, aiding in development ofdistributed OS/2 and Windows applications.andM;VINES Version 4.10 will ship this month.andP;  Suggested U.S.andP;  list prices are:$2,495 for VINES Team (10 users); $7,495 for VINES Unlimited; and $13,995 forVINES SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing).andP;  Customers purchasing Version 4.0releases between April 8 and june 8 of this year - and all users of Version4.0 having software support contracts with Banyan or its resellers - willautomatically be upgraded to VINES Version 4.10 at no additional charge.andM;MICROSOFT CORP. HAS COMPLETED ITS acquisition of Consumers Software Inc. andannounced its first product to come out of the new relationship.andP;  MicrosoftMail for PC Networks, which the company developed with CSI, is based on CSI'sNetwork Courier.andP;  Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, which is currentlyshipping, runs on all IBM PC and compatible networks, such as LAN Manager,NetWare, LAN Server, and VINES.andP;  It will be sold in mail server packs andworkstation packs.andP;  Each Microsoft Mail server pack comes with Modem Mail,which supports remote users dialing into the network.andP;  The remoteworkstations will need to run Microsoft Mail Remote Workstation software,which is purchased separately.andM;The Mail server pack is $695 per server.andP;  Workstation packs are $395 for fiveusers; $1,349 for 20 users;  S,500 for 100 users; and $22,500 for 500 users.andO;Existing users of Network Courier (any version) can upgrade to Microsoft Mailfor PC Networks at no cost.andM;Microsoft also plans Microsoft Mail gateways to mail systems based on MHS,X.400, IBM PROFS and SNADS, DEC VAX Mail, MCI Mail, and Simple MessageTransfer Protocol (SMTP).andP;  CISCO SYSTEMS INC. AND NEC AMERICA Corp. havejoined to develop the Switched Multimegabit Data Service (SMDS) routerinterface operating at the DS-3 speed of 44.736 Mbits/sec.andM;Under terms of the joint agreement cisco and NEC's Switching System Divisionwill develop the high-speed interface that enables cisco's multiprotocol AGS+router/bridge to link remote LANs over a packet-switched WAN using SMDS.andP;  Anemerging standard data service will be offered by the Regional Bell OperatingCompanies.andM;The two-part interface, to be completed by the end of this year, will consistof software developed by cisco Systems running on the AGS+, and anNEC-developed SMDS DSU/CSU unit called the SMDS Adapter  SADP).andP;  cisco willsell the router and DSU/CSU portions of the interface.andP;  NEC will sell bothwith its SMDS switch, the NEAX 61E SMDS service node.andP;  ORGANIZATIONS NEEDINGENTRY-LEVEL LAN access to national and international internetworks can turnto Performance Systems International Inc.'s LAN Dial-up Connection Service.andO;LAN DCS provides access to the PSINet national internetwork, which in turnconnects to the other national interworks, via the Commercial InternetExchange, and to international networks.andP;  Using only a phone line, a router,and a modem, users of the dialup service now have access to a TCP/IP-basedglobal internetwork.andM;To use LAN DCS, users dial in to a PSINet point of presence.andP;  (Currently,points of presence are in Boston, New York, Albany, N.Y., Reston, Va.,andO;Mountain View, Calif., and Santa Clara, Calif.) The user then sets up apacket session, which establishes the communications link for data transferbetween the user's workstation and the dialed-up node.andM;The service supports V.32 modem technology, which can provide 19.2Kbit/secthroughput rates when combined with data compression.andP;  LAN DCS usesPoint-to-Point Protocol and is compatible with internetworking routerproducts such as Telebit Corp.'s NetBlazer and KA9Q public-domain routersoftware.andP;  The service costs $300 per month plus a one-time registration feeof $300.andM;AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN DIGITAL EQUIPment Corp. and QStar Technologies Inc.andO;makes DEC a direct marketer of QStar optical storage subsystems.andP;  The dealcovers subsystems for DECstation 5000s and RISC and VAX systems runningUltrix.andP;  Under the agreement, customers will place their QStar orders withDEC distributors, who will then place the order with QStar.andP;  QStar will shipthe unit directly to the customer and provide service and maintenance.andP;  QStaris currently the only optical storage dealer on DEC's third-party supplierfist for Ultrix machines.andP;  The QStar drives for the DEC systems range from asingle 5.25-inch disk 650-Mbyte rewritable unit to a multiple 12-inch disk328Gbyte jukebox.andM;EAGLE TECHNOLOGY, A SUBSIDIARY OF Anthem Electronics Inc., has been grantedthe exclusive rights to manufacture and market Novell Inc. Ethernet NICS.andO;The Novell cards include the NE1000, NE2000, NE3200, NE/2, and NE/2-32.andP;  Theline is marketed under the Novell NetWare and Eagle Technology co-label andsold through Novell's authorized distributors and resellers.andP;  Anthemoriginally signed a manufacturing and marketing agreement with Novell in1989.andP;  In addition to assuming Anthem's responsibilities, Eagle plans toproduce its own connectivity line or co-produce another line in the future.andO;9</TEXT></DOC>
