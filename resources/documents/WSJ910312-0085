Errantpolicemen could be disciplined without excluding validevidence of a criminal's guilt. Legal strategists willrecognize this as a Tomahawk missile aimed at theexclusionary rule.   So it is not quite true that the President has no domesticagenda. We do think he needs an economic policy. As StephenMoore demonstrates alongside, while Budget Director RichardDarman was out negotiating tax increases, federal spendinghas been running out of control. The much-bemoaned $300billion deficit is almost exactly equal to the $300 billionspending increase under Bush-Darman budget scrutiny.</LP><TEXT>   Still, the crime agenda is not nothing. The Republiccertainly does need the &quot;domestic tranquility&quot; envisioned bythe Founding Fathers. Making the criminal-justice system workand reducing the crime problem would certainly serve thepublic interest. It would also be a big political issue, asWillie Horton demonstrated. And the way to start is by endingthe notion of excluding evidence instead of discipliningpolicemen. This is a peculiarity of the Americancriminal-justice system, applied by the Supreme Court to thestates only in 1961, and since elaborated into Mirandawarning rules and other ludicrous extremes.   &quot;I'm not a lawyer, but I put great stock in common sense,&quot;President Bush told a gathering of state attorneys general.&quot;And it never did make sense that because a policeman hasmade a mistake, a dangerous criminal can get off scot-free.The Supreme Court has invited legislative experimentationwith a direct action to prevent illegal searches andseizures. And so today, I'm announcing that we are acceptingthat invitation.&quot;   Yesterday's Bush proposal, which Attorney General DickThornburgh and his top aides devised over the past few weeks,says that when federal agents commit a Fourth Amendmentviolation in seizing a firearm, the evidence can still begiven to the jury in two situations. One is where the gun wasused during a violent crime or serious drug offense. Also,regardless of the offense, when the defendant is alreadydisqualified by federal law from possessing a firearm -- acategory that includes everyone who has already beenconvicted of a felony, which means all repeat criminals. Callthis real gun control.   Those civil libertarians who suffer from proceduralitiswill no doubt always object to any move to dilute theexclusionary rule. But Mr. Bush is right that the SupremeCourt has often said that nothing in the Constitutionrequires the extreme step of suppressing improperly seizedevidence. Indeed, the court has strongly urged the politicalbranches of government to come up with what justices havecalled &quot;more efficacious sanction.&quot;   So the Bush proposal sets up sanctions to punish federalagents who commit unlawful searches and seizures and alsocreates a way to compensate the innocent victims. The billwould set up a Justice Department Review Board to overseethis alternative to the exclusionary rule. This group wouldimpose disciplinary action directly on the federal agents whobroke the rules. It would also administer a new program topay damages to the people who suffered unlawful searches orseizures.   For the first time, then, we would end the situation wherewhen two people commit offenses -- the criminal and thelaw-enforcement officer -- both get to go free. The criminalcan be convicted because the jury can see the evidence. Thenthe officer would be subjected to internal punishment.   As remarkable as this proposal is, it could go further. Wedon't know why guns should be the only evidence subject tothis alternative. Why not also include evidence of drugs,knives, lead pipes? For that matter, so long as confessionsare voluntary why ban them just because the Miranda warningis garbled? Indeed, why not allow all relevant evidence of acrime to go to juries regardless of errors by lawenforcement.   The other problem, of course, is that some 95% of crimesare tried in state courts, not in federal court. The billincludes language aimed at state and federal judges remindingthem that the exclusionary rule is not a constitutionalrequirement so long as there is a better way in place topunish errant policemen. This is a not-so-subtle hint thatthe states can abolish their own exclusionary rules byadopting similar methods of disciplining officers andcompensating victims.   All this could come in time if the initial Bush proposalis passed and works in practice, and it is of coursepolitically clever to link the issue with the liberal petcause of gun control. But the important point is JudgeCardozo's classic remark that it makes no sense to say &quot;thecriminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
