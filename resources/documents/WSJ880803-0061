Doskocil last week began a tender offer to acquire Wilson for $12.50 a share, or about $115 million for the 90.4% of the pork producer and processor that it doesn't already own.    Wilson, Oklahoma City, said it filed a suit charging that Doskocil made improper disclosures in its tender offer materials. Wilson asked the court to enjoin the offer until proper disclosures are made.    A Doskocil spokesman couldn't be reached to comment on Wilson's suit. But the company, a Hutchinson, Kan., maker of pizza toppings, said it asked the Delaware Chancery Court to issue a temporary restraining order preventing Wilson from issuing a new convertible exchangeable preferred stock. Doskocil has charged that the proposed stock offering would reduce the value of Wilson's common shares.    A Wilson spokesman, noting that a hearing on Doskocil's request is scheduled for today, declined comment. </TEXT></DOC>
