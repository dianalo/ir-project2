Col. William R. Higgins was abducted in February 1988,the U.S. Marine was on duty for the United Nations in a land sodangerous for Americans that the State Department had declared itoff-limits.   Higgins, 44, commanded an international group monitoringcease-fire violations on the Lebanon-Israel border. He waskidnapped while returning from talks with a moderate Shiite Moslemmilitia leader, who said their conversation touched on the subjectof foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.   A statement from the kidnappers issued Dec. 12, 1988, said theyhad sentenced Higgins to death as a spy for Israel.   ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute thisAmerican spy,'' said the statement signed by a group calling itselfthe Organization of the Oppressed on Earth. It did not set a datefor killing him.   On Monday, his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors said they hadhanged the American in retaliation for Israel's abduction of SheikAbdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite cleric in south Lebanon.   They released a videotape in which a man said to be Higginsdangled from a gallows, his hands and feet bound with rope. Therewas no way to verify whether the victim was Higgins or when thehanging had occurred.   A diplomatic source told The Associated Press the United Nationshad received unconfirmed reports Higgins was killed after the USSVincennes shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf on July3, 1988.   On Monday, Israeli analysts questioned whether Higgins was alivebefore Obeid was captured Friday.   Higgins, born Jan. 15, 1945, in Danville, Ky., had been an aideto Caspar W. Weinberger, secretary of defense in the Reaganadministration. When he was abducted Feb. 17, 1987, he led a75-member observer group assigned to the U.N. peacekeeping force insouth Lebanon.   In January 1987, the State Department declared Lebanonoff-limits to U.S. citizens, except for the families of kidnapvictims, journalists and others with special permission.   The Pentagon has said American officers chosen for duty with theUnited Nations are under U.N. command and the Pentagon has nocontrol over where they serve.   Higgins was kidnapped while returning from a meeting in Tyrewith Abdel Majid Saleh, a political leader in the area of themoderate Shiite militia Amal, Saleh told reporters. He said thetopics of discussion included efforts to free foreign hostages.   U.N. officials said Higgins was driving a marked U.N. stationwagon, following a similar vehicle carrying two other members ofthe observer force. The first car lost sight of Higgins around abend, returned to look for him and found his vehicle abandoned.   Security sources in Tyre said two gunmen in a brown Volvo passedHiggins' station wagon, blocked the road, forced him into their carand drove north toward Tyre.   They said the abduction occurred between Ras el-Ein and DeirQanoun, villages controlled by Amal, and that members of themilitia helped with the search search for Higgins.   Reporters in Tyre said at the time the influence of thefundamentalist Shiite militia Hezbollah, or Party of God, had beengrowing in the villages. Hezbollah, allied with Iran, is believedto be the umbrella group for radical factions holding most foreignhostages in Lebanon.   Higgins' uncle, Delbert Eagle of Lancaster, Ky., said of hisnephew soon after the kidnapping: ``He loves his country. `He iscapable of standing up as well as an ordinary man will under thecircumstances. ... I don't think they could bring enough pressureor pain to cause him to betray his country in any way.''   Higgins grew up in Jefferson County, Ky., and won appointment toWest Point, but chose instead to attend Miami University in Oxford,Ohio, on a Navy ROTC scholarship.   He was commissioned a second lieutenant when he graduated in1967 with a business degree, and later earned master's degrees inhuman resources management at Pepperdine University and politicalscience at Auburn University.   Higgins served in Vietnam in 1968 and 1972. He later was a riflecompany commander in Okinawa, Japan, an instructor at the academyfor non-commissioned officers at Quantico, Va., and a rifle companycommander at Camp Lejeune, N.C.   In 1980, he graduated from the Air Force Command and StaffCollege at Maxwell Air Force Base. Higgins served in various staffpositions at Marine Corps headquarters in Washington and at thePentagon, and graduated from the National War College in 1985.   He and his first wife, the former Bonita Spalding of Louisville,had a daughter, Christine Lynn. His second wife, Marine Maj. RobinHiggins, works at the Pentagon.   Both parents have died _ his mother, Mary Ethel Higgins, in1979, and his father, William F. Higgins, soon after the abduction.</TEXT></DOC>
