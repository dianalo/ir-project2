Introduction</ITAG>In May 1987, the Commission proposed for comment a revision to Form BD,\1\<NOTE/> the uniform registration form that is filed by an applicantto become registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Actof 1934 (the ``Act''). The revision provided that the applicant consentsthat service of any civil actions brought by or notice of any proceedingbefore the Commission or any self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') inconnection with the applicant's broker-dealer activities may be given byregistered or certified mail or confirmed telegram to the applicant's contactemployee at the main address identified on Form BD, or mailing addressif different.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24402 (May 7, 1987),52 FR 17301.The Commission received one comment letter on the proposed revision.\2\<NOTE/> The commentator, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation(``SIPC''), requested that the proposed Form BD consent provision be expandedto include language explicitly providing that the applicant broker-dealerconsents that service or notice of any application for a protective decree(``application'') filed by SIPC may be given in the same manner as providedin the proposed consent, that is, by registered or certified mail or confirmedtelegram to the applicant's contact employee at the main address identifiedon Form BD, or mailing address if different. The Commission is proposingfor comment inclusion of this provision in Form BD, and at the same timehas adopted the proposed revision in a separate release.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Letter from Theodore H. Focht, President andamp; GeneralCounsel, SIPC, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 5, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25285 (January 22,1988).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion</ITAG>SIPC's request arises from the difficulty it has experienced in a numberof instances in obtaining adequate service of process in applications forprotective decrees for broker-dealers that failed financially. These difficultieshave resulted in delays in filing applications or in some cases refusalsto entertain such applications by the courts. SIPC, a non-profit membershipcorporation,\4\<NOTE/> created by the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970(``SIPA''), files applications for protective decrees in its essentialrole of providing protection to customers of member broker-dealer thatfail financially. If SIPC concludes that a member broker-dealer has failedor is in danger of failing to meet its obligations to customers, and findsconditions suggestive of financial irresponsibility, SIPC, upon noticeto the member broker-dealer, files an application for a protective decreein a United States Federal District Court. If the court agrees with SIPC'sdetermination, it will appoint a trustee to oversee the liquidation ofthe member broker-dealer. SIPC is required to advance the trustee sufficientfunds to ensure that customers of the broker-dealer receive return of theirfunds and securities left with the broker-dealer up to certain limits.SIPC funds are available to satisfy the claims of each customer up to amaximum of $500,000 including up to $100,000 on cash claims (as distinctfrom claims for securities). Thus, SIPC's ability to obtain timely serviceof its applications for protective decrees is important for the protectionof customers of broker-dealers that fail financially.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ SIPC membership is composed of all broker-dealers registeredunder section 15(b) of the Act, with some minor exceptions.SIPC's functions are subject to broad Commission supervision. SIPC mustfile with the Commission proposed rule changes for approval and proposedby law changes which become effective thirty days after filing unless disapprovedby the Commission. The Commission can require SIPC to adopt, amend, orrepeal any bylaws or rules. The Commission may examine SIPC's operationsand require SIPC to furnish it with such reports as it considers to bein the public interest. In addition, should SIPC fail to file an applicationfor a protective decree in what the Commission determines to be an appropriatecase, the Commission may apply to a United States Federal District Courtfor an order compelling SIPC to file an application for a protective decree.SIPC has no simple way of obtaining consent to service of process on itsown behalf. The Commission and SROs provide SIPC's only official channelof information regarding the financial health of its members. It does notreceive regular filings and the SROs serve as collection agents for SIPC-imposedassessments. Consequently, the Commission preliminary believes the FormBD should include a provision obtaining consent that service or noticeof process provided to the Form BD contact employee for any applicationfor a protective decree by SIPC is adequate for notice and jurisdictionalpurposes. The Commission requests comment on this provision.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Flexibility Act Considerations</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act establishes procedural requirements applicableto agency rulemaking that has a ``significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.'' \5\<NOTE/> The Chairman of the Commission has certified that the proposedrevision to Form BD, is adopted, would not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed amendmentswould not provide any additional cost on broker-dealers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Although section 601(b) of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct defines the term ``small entity'', the statute permits agencies toformulate their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitionsof the term small entity for purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordancewith the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Those definitions, as relevant tothis proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule 0-10, 17 CFR 240.0-10.<T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 18452 (January 28, 1982).A broker or dealer generally is a ``small business'' or ``small organization''if it had total capital of less than $500,000 on the date in the priorfiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were preparedpursuant to 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d). <T3>See </T3>Rule 0-10(c).It is highly unlikely that the proposed amendment to Form BD would havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. New broker-dealerswould consent to service of process only when completing the Form BD. Inaddition, existing broker-dealers will execute this consent to serviceof process only when they amend Form BD for some other reason.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Statutory Authority</ITAG>The proposed change to Form BD would be adopted pursuant to sections 15(b),17(a) and 23(a) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 249_FORMS, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934</ITAG>Form BD prescribed by andSection; 249.501 is amended by revising the Executionparagraph to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 249.501 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Amended]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Uniform Application for Broker-Dealer Registration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>Execution<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>The applicant consents that service of any civil action brought by or noticeof any proceeding before the Securities and Exchange Commission or anyself-regulatory organization in connection with the applicant's broker-dealeractivities or of any application for a protective decree filed by the SecuritiesInvestor Protection Corporation, may be given by registered or certifiedmail or confirmed telegram to the applicant's contact employee at the mainaddress, or mailing address if different, given in Item 1G.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
