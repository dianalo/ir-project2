Ward McCarthy, amanaging director at Stone andamp; McCarthy Research Associates,Princeton, N.J. He said that trading volume was thin becausemany dealers and investors &quot;are reluctant to be active in themarket because of the uncertainty regarding the Treasuryrefunding announcement.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   On Wednesday, the Treasury will announce details of itsquarterly refunding of the federal debt. The refundingpackage -- which will consist of three-year notes, 10-yearnotes and 30-year bonds -- is expected to total at least$34.5 billion. That was the amount that the Treasury sold atthe previous refunding in February, which set a record forsize.   But with the government's budget deficit soaring, someanalysts believe the size of the next refunding will be evenlarger. Investors worry that the large supply of new notesand bonds will overwhelm demand, causing prices to fall andyields to rise.   The Treasury's latest 30-year bond, the market's benchmarkissue, fell nearly 1/4 point yesterday, a loss of nearly$2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue'syield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price,rose to 8.22% from 8.20% on Friday.   In addition to supply worries, the bond market was hurt bythe latest economic report, which was stronger than expected.   In fact, bond prices had been as much as 1/4 point higherduring early trading. But the market reversed directionshortly after the Commerce Department released the latestdata on personal income and personal consumption expendituresfor March. The government said that personal income rose 0.2%in March while consumer spending rose 0.6%. The averageestimate of 11 economists surveyed by Dow Jones CapitalMarkets Report on Friday was for a 0.3% rise in personalincome and a 0.2% rise in personal consumption expenditures.   Even though other recent economic indicators havesuggested that the economy remains weak, some analysts saidthe personal income and consumption report seems to indicatethat the economy, spurred by consumer buying power, may berebounding.   However, Robert Brusca, chief economist at NikkoSecurities Co. International Inc., disagrees. &quot;The economy isweak, and people will buy bonds,&quot; he said. &quot;Signs ofbottoming {in economic activity} are very ephemeral, and wecould see a lot more declines in interest rates.&quot;   Still, dealers and investors &quot;don't want to start to getconstructive ahead of the refunding,&quot; said Mr. Brusca. &quot;Insome sense, {the market} is still digesting the auctions oflast week, so it's a difficult time for the bond market.&quot;Last week, in addition to the regular weekly bill auction,the Treasury sold $12 billion of two-year notes and $9billion of five-year notes.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Prices of most corporate bonds edged lower in quiettrading.   Junk bond traders said most high-yield, high-risk bondsfinished the day with losses of 1/4 point.   Meanwhile, Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc., thesecond largest U.S. bottler of soft drink products forCoca-Cola Co., filed with the Securities and ExchangeCommission to offer $150 million of 10-year subordinatednotes.   The bonds are expected to be offered in late May throughunderwriters at Salomon Brothers Inc. If completed, the salewould be the second junk bond offering to reach the publicmarket this year. Two weeks ago, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.became the first company since last fall to offer public junkbonds when it sold $1.5 billion of the senior notes.   Joseph Bencivenga, deputy director of stock and junk bondresearch at Salomon, said the RJR Nabisco offering &quot;provedthere was an opening&quot; for new high-yield bond issues.However, Mr. Bencivenga doesn't expect a wave of new issues.   &quot;Currently, banks are offering much more attractive rates{to companies that want to borrow} than the high-yield marketis, even for the best credits,&quot; he said.   Market participants expect the Johnston Coca-Cola notes,when offered, to be priced in line with comparable securitiesfrom the company -- now yielding about 11.375%. The notesaren't backed by Coca Cola Co.   The proceeds will be used along with about $150 millionfrom a new bank term loan to pay debt under the company's$305 million revolving credit facility, the prospectus says.   The proceeds will also go toward paying off $40 million ofnotes held by Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. in connection withJohnston Coca-Cola's acquisition last year of Coca-ColaBottling Co. of Northern Ohio. Johnston Coca-Cola is based inChattanooga, Tenn.   Since the public market for new junk bond issues hasfallen on hard times, much of the slack has been picked up bythe private market.   Citicorp recently completed a $75 million redemptionamount offering for Warnaco Inc., the apparel concern. Thesenior secured discount notes were priced to yield 18%. BTSecurities Corp. is currently in the market with a $125million note offering for Food 4 Less Supermarkets Inc. Thetargeted price talk for the offering wasn't immediatelyavailable.   Johnston Coca-Cola's subordinated debt is currently ratedsingle-B-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. anddouble-B-plus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Most municipal bonds ended unchanged after a session ofextremely quiet dealings.   Today, municipal bond market participants will be focusingon New York City's planned sale of $1.25 billion short-termrevenue anticipation notes.   Late yesterday, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. assigned a ratingof SP-2 to the RANs and downgraded some existing New YorkCity RANs, a move that will make it tougher for underwritersto sell the notes and will put more upward pressure onyields.   Prior to the Sandamp;P annoucement, the price talk on thetwo-month notes -- which will be sold via competitive bid at11 a.m. EDT -- was for a yield in the 6.70% range, nearly twopercentage points higher than the yield oncomparable-maturity notes from such issuers as California.   Sandamp;P said the lower RAN ratings reflect, among otherthings, the city's aggravated short-term cash position forfiscal 1991 and New York State's delay in passing its budgetand distributing fiscal aid to the city. Sandamp;P said that if NewYork City does not receive its state payments by late June,the city &quot;will not have sufficient funds at such time to meetits cash flow requirements without taking additional actionswhich would require approval by the state Legislature.&quot;   Despite the downgrade, some municipal funds are able topurchase the notes because they still carry investment-graderatings. SP-2 is Sandamp;P's lowest investmentgrade rating forshort-term municipal notes.   Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasury notes and bonds ended unchanged to moderatelylower in quiet trading.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of96 to yield 8.22%, compared with 96 7/32 to yield 8.20% onFriday. Prices of some short-term notes were unchanged. Thelatest two-year notes, for example, ended at a price of 1007/32 to yield 6.86%, the same as Friday.   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 366-day year.                                                                                                                                      13-Week          26-Week                                                                                                        Applications ...........  $24,393,000,000   $21,571,005,000 Accepted bids ..........  $ 8,008,200,000   $ 8,007,620,000 Accepted at low price ..              23%               48% Accepted noncompet'ly ..  $ 1,257,160,000   $   773,560,000 Average price (rate) ...   98.584 (5.60%)    97.128 (5.68%) High price (rate) ......   98.592 (5.57%)    97.139 (5.66%) Low price (rate) .......   98.582 (5.61%)    97.123 (5.69%) Coupon equivalent ......            5.78%             5.95% Cusip number ...........        912794WS9         912794XL3                                                                                                          Both issues are dated May 2, 1991. The 13-week billsmature Aug. 1, 1991, and the 26-week bills mature Oct. 31,1991.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Prices of mortgage securities ended lower.   The 8.5% securities for May delivery from all threeagencies were down 5/32. Government National MortgageAssociation 8.5% securities were at 97 14/32, Federal HomeLoan Mortgage Corp. Gold 8.5% securities were at 97 5/32 andFederal National Mortgage Association 8.5% securities were at96 30/32.   Ginnie Mae 8.5% securities were yielding 8.99%, 0.92percentage point above the yield on 10-year Treasurys. Thatspread was 0.02 percentage point wider than late Friday.   Mortgage securities have generally been keeping pace withTreasurys for most of the month because dealers have beenpurchasing a sizable amount of mortgage securities ascollateral for real estate mortgage investment conduit deals.Underwriters have said the huge amount of new Remics havebeen placed with investors, but some traders and analystshave been saying that the market would soon reach asaturation level, if it hadn't already reached that point.   Once the housing industry recovery becomes moresignificant, mortgage originations will rise and there willconsequently be more mortgages to securitize. Supplypressures will build, some market participants say, causingmortgages to lag further behind Treasurys and yield spreadsto widen more.   In primary activity, Fannie Mae announced a $300 millionRemic, series 199163, which was backed by Fannie Mae 15-year9% securities and underwritten by Lehman Brothers.</TEXT></DOC>
