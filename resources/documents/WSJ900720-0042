In a suit filed in Texas, Maxus alleged that it paid morethan it should have in its 1983 acquisition of Natomasbecause inside information was passed by former Kidderinvestment banker Martin A. Siegel to convicted former stockspeculator Ivan F. Boesky. Maxus, formerly Diamond ShamrockCorp., sought $1.6 billion in damages.</LP><TEXT>   Senior U.S. District Judge Milton J. Pollack rebukedMaxus's lawyers for litigating the same issues in state courtin Dallas that he said he had already decided in Manhattan.   &quot;Semantic adroitness will not serve to obscure what waslitigated, argued and then decided in this court,&quot; JudgePollack wrote in the injunction issued late Wednesday.   Judge Pollack had ruled in April that Maxus, based inDallas, hadn't suffered injury during the 1983 Natomaspurchase and wasn't entitled to make claims against Kidderbased on the alleged stock price run-up.   Judge Pollack's order reversed a ruling by state DistrictJudge Adolph Canales of Dallas. In that ruling last month,Judge Canales denied Kidder's request to dismiss most of theclaims. In seeking a dismissal, Kidder had cited the Aprilruling by Judge Pollack, which Maxus has appealed. The appealis pending.   Maxus had argued before Judge Canales that Judge Pollack'sorder had no effect on its Texas action and that it was &quot;notclear.&quot; Judge Pollack's April order and this week'sinjunction don't affect Maxus's efforts in the Texas suit torecover more than $4 million in fees and expenses it paid toKidder in the transaction.   Gary Naftalis, the lawyer for Kidder, a unit of GeneralElectric Co., declined to comment. Charles E. Davidow, theattorney for Mr. Boesky, who would have been required totestify in the Texas case, said, &quot;Judge Pollack seems to takethe view that once he enters an order, it will be viewed asbinding and not merely a recommendation.&quot;   A Maxus spokeswoman said, &quot;We have already appealed {JudgePollack's} earlier ruling and no decisions about furthersteps have been made at this point.&quot;   ---   WORKERS MAY NOT BE BOUND by agreements not to sue for agebias.   A federal judge in Tampa issued the ruling in a battleover whether companies can enforce signed statements in whicholder employees agree not to sue for civil rights claims orback wages. Fired employees often waive their legal claimsagainst a company in exchange for higher severance pay.   But Judge William Castagna ruled that the AgeDiscrimination in Employment Act makes the waiversunenforceable unless the severance agreement is supervised bythe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or a federalcourt.   Many other courts have enforced unsupervised waivers ifthe waiver was found to be &quot;knowing and voluntary.&quot; JudgeCastagna rejected that standard, arguing that &quot;unsupervisedwaivers of ADEA claims are contrary to the intent of theCongress that passed the ADEA.&quot; He said Congress repeatedlyhas suspended EEOC regulations permitting employers to obtainwaivers without supervision.   The case involves more than 100 workers fired byBrown-Forman Corp., Louisville, Ky., in November 1986.William Gormin, the plaintiff who initially filed the suit,alleges he was fired as part of the company's policy to forceolder employees to retire early &quot;despite theirqualifications, ability and willingness to work&quot; and toreplace them with younger workers.   Brown-Forman asked Judge Castagna to dismiss the casebecause the lead plaintiff had signed a release of all claimswhen he accepted $56,000 in severance pay. But the judgerefused, saying that when older workers sign waivers as partof a severance agreement, they face &quot;little more than aHobson's choice,&quot; with no real alternative.   Ed Fessenden, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, saidthe judge's decision effectively blocks Brown-Forman'sefforts to avoid a trial. Lawyers for Brown-Forman refused tocomment on the case.   ---   LICENSING COMPANY allowed to pursue controversial patentsuit.   Refac International Ltd. sued six major software companiesin 1989 after buying a 5% stake in a patent allegedly used inspreadsheet software. But last May, Judge Michael Mukasey infederal court in Manhattan ruled that the suit would bethrown out because of Refac's licensing agreement. The judgesaid the licensing arrangement violated New York state lawagainst champerty, which occurs when someone helps pay thecost of someone else's suit in exchange for a share of anyproceeds.   To comply with the judge's ruling, Refac, a subsidiary ofRefac Technology Development Corp., said Forward ReferenceSystems Ltd. has joined as a plaintiff in the suit. TheCanadian company owns the remaining 95% of the patent. Thejudge had said Refac was illegally acting as the surrogatefor Forward Reference Systems.   Eugene Lang, president of Refac Technology, said thecompany also has moved to drop its claims against all but oneof the defendants, Lotus Development Corp.   Mr. Lang said he disagreed with Judge Mukasey's rulingthat Refac had bought a stake in the patent for the purposeof pursuing litigation. &quot;Our purpose is to license, not tolitigate,&quot; he said.   Henry Gutman, an attorney for Lotus, said the allegationsof patent infringement were &quot;entirely without merit.&quot; He saidthe company is exploring whether Refac's role in the case isstill illegal despite the change in plaintiffs.   ---   EX-CITIBANK EXECUTIVE sentenced to eight years forstealing $25 million.   Mario Rios Pinochet, formerly a vice president in chargeof safeguarding assets at Citibank, was convicted in May ofembezzling five bearer securities valued at $5 million each.Prosecutors accused Mr. Pinochet, 48, of taking thesecurities on Jan. 25 while inspecting a vault in Manhattanas part of an effort to improve security procedures atCitibank, a unit of Citicorp.   At the sentencing before Judge Robert J. Ward in federalcourt in Manhattan, Mr. Pinochet strongly denied anywrongdoing and said he would appeal. He also told the judgethat the securities he allegedly took had no market value.   Judge Ward rejected Mr. Pinochet's request to be releasedon bail pending appeal, citing the possibility that Mr.Pinochet, who has family in Chile and other countries, mightflee the U.S. One of the five securities taken from the vaultis still missing.   The judge ordered Mr. Pinochet to make restitution of asmuch as $5 million to Citibank if the bank makes payments onthe security during Mr. Pinochet's sentence.   ---   FORMER TEXAS THRIFT OWNER Edwin T.
