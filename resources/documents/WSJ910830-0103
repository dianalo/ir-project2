His reluctance is buttressed by a new Wall StreetJournal/NBC News poll showing that voters by 56% to 39%oppose direct economic aid. Still, White House officials sayhe will eventually back stepped-up food, technical and otherassistance, and they already scramble to figure out how topay for it. Using the budget law's &quot;emergency&quot; loophole ispolitically impossible unless Bush is willing to use it toextend domestic unemployment benefits, too.</RE><TEXT>   Bush may face longer-term complications if more alliesstart to break ranks and push for more-massive aid. If theSoviets give the Kuril Islands back, Japan would quickly turnon the aid spigot. But the islands are part of the Russianrepublic, and Yeltsin is ambivalent about letting them go.   Some European officials push a triangular aid plan inwhich the West would give money to the Soviets to buy EasternEuropean goods.                                                                                                          FALLING DOMINOES? Losers from the coup span the globe.   Foes of China's government are bolstered: U.S. officialsfigure the hard-liners will hold on only until the old guarddies off -- or until the army is no longer willing to do whatit did at Tiananmen Square. Castro may be out in two years,says Richard Millett, a Southern Illinois University expert.He sees a possible coup by &quot;soft-liners&quot; as Cuba's economysinks out of sight.   North Korea looks like communism's last bastion: Recentvisitors say it is plastered with pictures of Kim Il-Sung'sson and putative successor. Other losers include Libya, Iraqand the PLO, because they supported the coup. A possiblesilver lining for the losers: The desperate need for hardcurrency in Moscow could well compel continued arms sales.                                                                                                          COMMUNISM'S COLLAPSE plunges U.S. conservatives intodisarray.   &quot;Even a majority of conservatives now believes the ColdWar is mostly over,&quot; say Journal/NBC pollsters Peter Hart andRobert Teeter. Without the glue of anti-communism, theconservative coalition may collapse. Many conservativesstruggle to shift the debate to domestic issues. GOP Rep.Dornan calls for a crusade against &quot;the internal enemy --decadent self-destruction.&quot;   But a social crusade threatens to alienate GOP-leaningyounger voters. Another split looms between internationalistsand isolationists. Norman Podhoretz complains &quot;there's been areal declaration of war&quot; on neoconservatives by a &quot;small gangof foreign-policy isolationists,&quot; while the Cato Institute'sEdward Crane criticizes those who &quot;think that the collapse ofcommunism is a rationale for us to be the policemen of theworld.&quot;   One major flash point for conservatives: foreign aid,especially if the U.S. is seen to be bailing out communistfailures.                                                                                                          FEARS OF FASCISM grow. There are already moves in SovietGeorgia to limit Muslims' political rights, and to formGeorgia's own version of the dreaded &quot;Black Beret&quot; policeunits. The Wiesenthal Center worries that the new CroatianDemocratic Union is forming a special police force of &quot;pureCroats without mixture of other blood.&quot; Heritage Foundationexpert Leon Aron cites Serbia and Romania as major concerns.                                                                                                          COUP CASUALTIES will include Soviet Ambassador toWashington Viktor Komplektov, a protege of ousted ForeignMinister Bessmertnykh whose embassy started churning outpress releases by the Emergency Committee on the day of thecoup.                                                                                                          STATE DEPARTMENT SNICKERS grow at the agility of GeorgiArbatov of the Soviets' U.S.A. Institute and articulate TVcommentator Vladimir Pozner. Brezhnev apologists a decadeago, they now criticize Gorbachev for not going far enough.                                                                                                          HELPING HAND? The breakaway Baltics figure to be in linealmost immediately for Western aid. U.S. officials suspectthe Baltics, with their &quot;sweatshop&quot; economies, don't graspthe problems they face in creating whole new economic systemsfor themselves. U.S. trade authorities ready favorabletreatment for them, assuming Western technology is adequatelyprotected.                                                                                                          CHOPPING BLOCK: Navy and Air Force face big hits in thebudget meltdown.   The Navy's Seawolf nuclear-powered attack submarine andArleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers stand to becut. The Air Force's hopes for 75 B-2 Stealth bombers are outthe window. The Army's next-generation armored vehicles, theupgrading of nuclear-weapons plants and development oflong-range, mobile ballistic missiles also face significantcuts.   Aides say Defense Secretary Cheney knows he'll lose somebig-ticket items but, for now, he adopts a hard line, arguingthat the Soviet situation is still too fluid to make suchdecisions. A possible winner amid the carnage: the StrategicDefense Initiative.   House Armed Services Chairman Aspin says the Sovietrevolution has &quot;strengthened the case&quot; for limited deploymentof ground-based defenses that are part of SDI.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: There's talk of a movie about the failed coup-- a remake of &quot;Eight Men Out.&quot; Only this time, the team isthe Reds. . . . Die-hards: The new Journal/NBC poll finds 24%of voters still agree with Reagan's famous pronouncement thatthe Soviet Union is an &quot;evil empire.&quot; . . .
