 Although it is a capable design and drawing tool (its strengthsare in architectural design and facilities management), its databasecapabilities are not in the same league with the other two products in thisreview.andM;The built-in database is limited to a flat-file data structure -- adequatefor many design applications, but neither as flexible nor as powerful as therelational organization possible in CADvance and Cad/Base.andP;  (See Analyst'sNote, Page 37, for flat-file vs.andP;  relational comparison.)andM;However, because the Drawbase data structure is customized for themaintenance of data for drawings, it offers advantages over databases builton general-purpose database managers.andM;Data concerning objects in a Drawbase drawing is kept in one or more tables,each consisting of a set of attributes chosen from a predefined list.andP;  Theproduct comes with a starter list of standard attributes, to which the usercan add.andP;  The attribute list acts as a master data dictionary for the drawingdata; there may be one master list in the system, or a different one for eachproject.andM;A drawing may have as many as 16 tables associated with it, but each tablemay be linked to only one drawing.andM;To enter data, the user selects an object on the display and issues a commandthat pops up a data-entry window.andP;  Each object can have only one recordattached to it.andP;  To save time in entering data for multiple objects, the usercan enter a data record once and then attach identical copies of it to everyobject in a predefined group.andM;One feature of Drawbase's integrated database is the ability to track datafor special objects, called &quot;spaces,&quot; in the drawing.andP;  If the data form for aspace object contains the system-defined attributes -- area, perimeter,length and width -- then the associated values are automatically calculatedand written in the database, and automatically updated as the shape and sizeof the object are changed on the drawing.andM;Graphic responses to queries are another advantage of the close integrationof drawing and database functions in Drawbase.andP;  Instead of producing a listof records that matches the search criteria, Drawbase can highlight theassociated objects on the screen.andP;  A variety of printed reports, includingbills of materials, can also be produced.andM;Drawbase includes a programming language for writing procedures to performgraphic and database functions.andP;  The language has some of the flavor of BASICbut the syntax is different enough to require a significant time investment.andO;In ease of programming, Drawbase is at a disadvantage compared with the othertwo products, which use better-known languages -- dBASE in CADvance, and aderivative of BASIC in Cad/Base.andM;Drawbase's installation is marred by a very unintelligent procedure thatblindly appends statements to existing CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT fileswithout asking or even checking whether the required statements alreadyexist.andP;  CADWorks is aware of the problem and is working on a fix for the nextrelease.andM;Documentation consists of two thick binders of almost 1,000 pages each.andP;  Onlythe reference manual, which is organized alphabetically anyway, has an index;the larger &quot;how to&quot; manual does not.andM;CADWorks Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., can be reached at (617) 868-6003.andM;----------Buyers say: Easy to learn, transferandM;Ron Swenson, vice president of Dyer/ Brown andamp; Associates Inc., anarchitectural firm in Boston, chose Drawbase for its speed, capacity andcost-effectiveness.andM;When a symbol for an item is input into a drawing, Swenson said, it is tiedto the corresponding information in the database.andM;&quot;We've used it to quantify the furniture systems, the workstation-panelsystems and the file-shelving units,&quot; he said.andM;He found this ability very useful in laying out an office area.andP;  &quot;We haveworked on about 40,000 square feet of computer room [where] we were able toadd information about power and HVAC requirements,&quot; he said.andM;Drawbase is installed on four Compaq 25MHz 386 computers with 6M bytes ofRAM.andP;  A user can store files and access information across the company'sNovell Inc. network.andM;Drawbase has the ability to export database files to spreadsheets and toimport text files, according to Swenson, who has converted Drawbase drawingsto and from Intergraph Corp.'s MicroStation PC, VersaCAD Corp.'s VersaCAD andAutodesk Inc.'s AutoCAD.andM;Ron Mallard, project manager for Stratus Computer Inc., a computermanufacturer in Marlboro, Mass., chose Drawbase because of its easily graspedmenu structure and database.andM;&quot;We have a tutorial, and within a week [users] are putting out drawings,&quot;said Mallard.andP;  &quot;[We allocate] 14 hours for training, and we have time leftover.&quot;andM;Drawbase is running on two Compaq 386 machines with 40M-byte hard drives.andM;Drawbase is used to transfer drawings to sales offices or to engineers andarchitects who may make changes in the office design.andM;&quot;We will forward the drawings to landlords and/or architectural firms,&quot;Mallard said.andP;  &quot;An engineering group may lay out something.andP;  They will giveus the floppy, and we transfer it to a DXF file [so] we don't have to redrawit.&quot;andM;</TEXT></DOC>
