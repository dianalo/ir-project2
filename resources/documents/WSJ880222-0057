The payout to about 160,000 eligible Ford hourly and salaried workers will be substantially higher than last year's average $2,100 and marks the fifth consecutive year of profit-sharing payments for the No. 2 auto maker. Ford said checks will be distributed March 8.    In a speech broadcast Friday to more than 200 Ford offices in the U.S., Donald E. Petersen, chairman, credited Ford's 1987 record $4.6 billion net income to the efforts of Ford workers. He said Ford believes its total profit-sharing pool of more than $635 million for 1987 is the largest single-year payout for a major U.S. corporation.    For the second consecutive year, Ford beat out General Motors Corp. on earnings and on profit-sharing payments. GM, which recently reported 1987 net income of $3.55 billion, won't pay profit-sharing to its eligible hourly and salaried workers because of low earnings from domestic-vehicle operations. &quot;Given the current competitive climate, we feel that jobs are more important than profit sharing,&quot; a GM spokesman said. &quot;But our goal is to provide both in the future,&quot; he added.    The Ford and GM profit-sharing programs are based on earnings in the U.S. Both programs were established through contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union in 1982.    Stanley A. Seneker, Ford executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the bonus pool for Ford's approximately 5,500 top executives also reached a record level in 1987, but the percentage increase over 1986 wasn't as large as the more than 70% increase in the profit-sharing pool. He said Ford won't disclose the amount of the bonuses until it publishes its proxy statement in early April.    In 1986, Ford paid a total of $164 million in executive bonuses, or an average of about $30,000. Bonuses for Ford's five highest-paid officials were far above the average, however, with Mr. Petersen and Ford's president, H. A. Poling, getting more than $1 million each. </TEXT></DOC>
