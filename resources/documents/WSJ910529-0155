For less than $65,000 in computers and software, the stateteachers' union has established itself as a competing powercenter in the most partisan activity in politics. The unionis one of scores of special-interest groups nationwide that,for the first time, are emerging as major forces inredistricting.</LP><TEXT>   Advances in computer capability and increasinglysophisticated software are shining some light into thebackrooms of politics, if not exactly inviting the publicinside. &quot;Reapportionment happens only every 10 years, andevery 10 years we get a total revolution in technology,&quot; saysDonald Cooke, president of Geographic Data Technology Inc., aLyme, N.H., company that sells redistricting software. &quot;Themachines are more powerful, easier to use and cheaper thanever before.&quot;   A decade ago, it would have required about $1 million ofcomputers, programming and software just to begin to make amark in redistricting. Now the price of entry is under$100,000. Sammamish Data Systems Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., haseven come out with a rudimentary package of software,geographic boundary files and census data for $79.   The results of this trend are clear in Indiana, where aparticularly bloody redistricting battle is keeping the stateLegislature in a special session. &quot;The process is a lot moreopen now,&quot; says Democratic state House Speaker MichaelPhillips. &quot;People can make suggestions and proposals thistime around.&quot;   When the state redistricting computers broke down thiswinter, the teachers' computer, humming away on the ninthfloor of the union building, became something of analternative redistricting headquarters. Now, as party leaderscirculate state legislative redistricting plans this spring,backbenchers wander across the street to the teachers'building to check the union's computers for an independentanalysis.   &quot;They showed the pitfalls in what I thought would be agood district for me,&quot; says freshman Democratic state Rep.Jerry Denbo, who represents parts of five counties in theFrench Lick area in the very southern part of the state.&quot;They showed me the numbers. They pointed out some things tome.&quot;   For politicians, the technological advances enhance theirability to fine-tune their redistricting plans. But forunions, lobbying associations, advocacy groups and black andHispanic organizations across the country, this increasedaccess to information puts them in a position not only tochallenge the politicians' plans but also to come up withplans of their own.   &quot;We want to empower local groups to draw their own plans,&quot;says Robert Brischetto, executive director of the SouthwestVoter Research Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan researchinstitution studying Hispanic political issues. &quot;This is aprocess that involves incumbents' protecting their turf, andthey don't necessarily have the best interests of minoritygroups in mind.&quot;   Redistricting is a political earthquake, reflectingmassive population shifts and rumbling through the nation'stown halls, city council chambers, county commission offices,state houses and reaching into the halls of Congress. Datafrom the 1990 census, for example, will affect the size ofcongressional delegations in 21 states and will giveCalifornia, Texas and Florida control of about a quarter ofthe House.   The implications for politics can't be overestimated.&quot;This is the whole political game, because it's setting therules for the next 10 years,&quot; says Rick Scott,political-action director of the American Federation ofState, County and Municipal Employees, the public-employees'union that is running its own computer plans in New York andOhio. &quot;The political winners and losers are being picked now,and we want to be in on it.&quot;   So do a number of black groups, which now have thecapability to argue for -- and to win -- minority districtsin several states. Hispanic activists are offeringalternative redistricting plans in Texas and are ready tofile suit in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and California.The Community Service Society, a 150-year-old nonpartisanadvocacy group for the poor in New York City, worked with thePuerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, the Asian Legal Defense Fundand the National Association for the Advancement of ColoredPeople to come up with its own redistricting plan for the NewYork City Council.   &quot;We're trying to maximize the power of people of color --blacks, Hispanics and Asians -- to elect their ownrepresentatives,&quot; says Terry Rosenberg, director of thegroup's population studies unit. &quot;We started with the censusdata rather than with a list of incumbents.&quot;   This openness is permitting special-interest groups toachieve what political cartographers since Elbridge Gerry,who in 18th century Massachusetts lent his name togerrymandering, have sought: political districts designed toachieve a specific outcome. &quot;Now minority groups and specialinterests are redesigning a geography in which a minoritybecomes a majority,&quot; says Martha Farnsworth Riche, directorof policy studies for the Population Reference Bureau, anonpartisan Washington research group. &quot;In some cases thatenhances democracy and in some cases it undermines it.&quot;   Few groups have become as influential in redistricting asthe Indiana teachers' union. &quot;The teachers ended up havingthe best data of anyone,&quot; says Paul Mannweiler, theRepublican leader in the state House.   The union's impact can be traced to a decision severalyears ago, when its leaders calculated that the way toinfluence state politics was to influence redistricting. Now,&quot;with the computers, we will know as much or more than thetwo political parties about the districts,&quot; says RobertMargraf, the union's chief lobbyist. &quot;We will be the primelibrarian of political information.&quot;   Moreover, that library of information will have an impactlong after this spring's special session on redistricting iscompleted. The teachers' computers, for example, can spew outhow many union members are in each precinct or legislativeand congressional district. &quot;We'll be able to tell acandidate what our strength is within his district,&quot; says Mr.Margraf. &quot;It will help them choose where to place lawn signsor to select a block captain or to organize walk lists,street by street.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
