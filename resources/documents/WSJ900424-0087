Last week's market activity was led by the bond market,where investors bid prices down sharply. As bond prices fell,the interest rates on those securities rose, posing a threatto already sluggish economic growth and giving investors anattractive alternative to stocks. Although the bond pricedecline moderated considerably yesterday, analysts said thelikelihood of further rate increases, including thepossibility that the Federal Reserve might soon pushshort-term rates higher, continued to frighten investors awayfrom stocks.   There also are worries that Japanese investors will beassuming a much lower profile in the U.S. bond market incoming months, a development that also could drive interestrates higher. James Solloway, chief economist at ArgusResearch in New York, noted that while Japanese investorsaren't the largest block of bondholders in the market, theyare influential. And with interest rates in Japan approaching7.25%, the real returns available to them in Japan are aboutas good as they are here without the currency risk ofinvesting in dollar-denominated securities.   Mr. Solloway, contending stocks already are overvalued atcurrent interest rates, said there is likely to be apsychological reaction among investors if the yield on theTreasury's benchmark 30-year bond rises to 9%. The yield isat 8.96%.   &quot;It's very difficult for stocks to beat a 9% yield on along-term basis,&quot; said Mr. Solloway. He suggests that stockprices could tumble 10% to 15% if interest rates rise muchfurther.   The dollar's rise against the West German mark followedpublished reports that German monetary union will include aone-to-one exchange rate for the bulk of East German savingsas well as wages and pensions. Currency traders said a broadone-to-one exchange rate between the two Germanies'currencies would be inflationary. The West German Bundesbankhas said it opposes a one-to-one exchange rate and centralbank officials have threatened to drive interest rates higherif such an exchange rate is approved.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices sank in light trading.
