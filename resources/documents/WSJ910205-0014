Sen. William Cohen of Maine, a senior Republican on theSenate Armed Services Committee, said the administrationshould continue the current air campaign &quot;for the nextseveral months,&quot; rather than seek &quot;a quicker, more rapidresolution of the conflict by going in on the ground.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The lawmaker asserted at a meeting with journalists thatmany of President Bush's supporters fear a ground war wouldbe too costly in American lives. &quot;I think there are more thanyou think on Capitol Hill and the Republican circles whothink we ought not to go to a ground war,&quot; he said. Theseopponents of a ground war don't want to move &quot;unless anduntil {we reach} a point where they {the Iraqis} are sodemoralized, so deprived of an ability to defend themselves,that we would suffer a minimum amount of casualties,&quot; headded.   Such sentiments, which have been relayed to the WhiteHouse, could pose a serious problem for the Bushadministration. The White House insists it isn't in any hurryto turn to ground combat. But it also is worried that seriousstrains could develop in the anti-Iraq international allianceif the war drags on inconclusively. The latter danger wasillustrated by an enormous anti-war demonstration Sunday inMorocco, which has sent troops to join coalition forces.   Sen. Cohen acknowledged that the question of whether toturn to a ground campaign poses an &quot;exquisite dilemma.&quot;Stretching out the war for months might only allow sympathyfor Saddam Hussein and Iraq to grow in Arab and Muslimcountries now backing the war, he noted.   But Sen. Cohen also argued that there will be politicalproblems in Arab and Muslim nations if the U.S. launches aground war in which many Iraqi soldiers die. It would bepreferable, he maintained, to continue economic sanctions towear down Iraq, &quot;supplemented&quot; with air power to block anymovements of military supplies to forces occupying Kuwait.   Some of Sen. Cohen's colleagues in Congress disagree,though. They argue that political leaders ought to letmilitary leaders decide what option to pursue. &quot;We have beensuccessful so far because we have given the militarydecisions to the military,&quot; said Rep. David McCurdy (D.,Okla.), the designated chairman of the House IntelligenceCommittee. But he added, &quot;I think the bombing has a marginalreturn after a while.&quot;   President Bush personally will approve any decision toturn to a ground campaign. That is shaping up to be the mostmomentous decision he faces in prosecuting the war to driveIraq out of Kuwait. In many ways, the debate over launching aground war parallels the earlier one about whether to go towar in the first place. In that debate, opponents said thatthe U.S. could go slow, relying on sanctions to weaken Iraqrather than attacking.   Administration aides insist that President Bush hasn'taddressed the issue yet, but he may consider it soon. Withoutadmitting to any fixed schedule, military officials speakprivately of the air war continuing for another 10 days.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney again asserted yesterdaythat the administration isn't in any hurry to turn to aground war. He said war plans always have assumed that groundforces will have to be sent to &quot;liberate Kuwait&quot; at somepoint; that was the only &quot;safe assumption&quot; to make forplanning purposes, he argued.   &quot;We do not want to do that until we've taken maximumadvantage of our capability to use our air forces . . .against {Saddam Hussein's} ground forces,&quot; Mr. Cheney said.&quot;We think we are doing very effective work at present in thatregard.&quot; A decision on a ground offensive &quot;will awaitdevelopments,&quot; he said.   President Bush yesterday sent similar signals, assertingthat &quot;we are going to set the timetable for what lies ahead,and not Saddam Hussein.&quot; And he declared, &quot;There will not beany quick changes.&quot;   U.S. officials are uncertain about the effectiveness ofB-52 strikes against Iraqi forces. Officials are confidentmajor havoc has been done to bridges and supply routes,though. This, in turn, is likely to lead to bottlenecks bybacking up Iraqi convoys, creating future targets for alliedwar planes.   Ground probes launched last week by Iraq into Saudi Arabiamay have been designed to draw the U.S. into a ground warquickly. The Iraqis may have hoped to inflict casualties andthus make the war unpopular inside the U.S. But U.S.officials said yesterday that Iraq's ground forces, whichwere repelled after suffering fairly heavy losses, seem tohave drawn back into their dug-in fortifications, perhaps tore-evaluate their plans.   The Pentagon believes last week's ground fightdemonstrates the advantages of allied air power. The Iraqiarmored units are credited with beginning the night operationwell, but they then came apart under the pressure from theair.   Separately, military officials also disclosed that Iranrecently turned back two Iraqi helicopters that apparentlywere attempting to seek haven in Iran, where nearly 100 Iraqiaircraft have taken refuge. That incident is anotherindication that Iran, which insists it is neutral and willimpound Iraqi planes there, isn't actively cooperating withIraq in a plan to store planes for later use in the war.   While reasserting its neutrality, Iran seems to bestepping up its efforts to become a diplomatic broker in thewar against Iraq. Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjaniannounced at a news conference in Tehran that he is willingto meet with Saddam Hussein to try to work out an end to thefighting. In addition, Iran's news agency announced thatSoviet Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Belonogov wouldvisit Tehran today for &quot;an exchange of views.&quot; Iran in recentdays has hosted envoys from Kuwait, France, Algeria andYemen; all of them traveled to Tehran to discuss the Gulfconflict.   Meanwhile, there were two troubling signs that pro-Iraqiterrorists may be stepping up their activity. In Norfolk,Va., authorities discovered a cluster of pipe bombs attachedto a big methanol tank about five miles from the NorfolkNaval Base, the country's largest such facility. Bomb expertsdisarmed the devices. The Federal Bureau of Investigation,which was brought in because of the possible terrorist link,insisted that the placement of the bombs didn't appear to bean act of terrorism, though. &quot;We have no claim of a terroristact,&quot; said FBI agent Jim Waters. &quot;It's very highly improbablethat this was terrorism.&quot;   At the same time, a gunman fired shots at a bus in Jedda,Saudi Arabia, that was carrying two American militaryofficials and a Saudi official. The Americans suffered slightwounds from flying glass. The incident appears to be thefirst terrorist attack on allied forces in Saudi Arabia,where the anti-Iraq coalition is based.   Last night, Iraq's state radio began broadcasting a seriesof cryptic messages from &quot;the main center&quot; tellingunidentified listeners to &quot;implement the program.&quot; Themessages could have been signals to its operatives outsideIraq or merely psychological warfare aimed at the West.   In the war with Iraq, there was a further sign that U.S.commanders may be able to supplement the air campaign againstIraqi forces without turning to a full-fledged groundoffensive. The American military command said the battleshipMissouri fired its 16-inch guns at Iraqi bunkers in Kuwait,the first time the ship has fired since the Korean War.   The firing is an indication that the U.S. now is confidentthat it can move the Missouri, whose guns have a 25-milerange, close to the Kuwaiti shore without worrying it will behit by anti-ship missiles. U.S. officials believe they havedestroyed all the Iraqi patrol boats capable of firingpowerful Exocet missiles, which are capable of inflictingheavy damage on warships. The guns of the Missouri and otherbattleships can fire rounds packed with more than 2,000pounds of explosives.   Meanwhile, the State Department said yesterday that it had&quot;credible information&quot; that some civilian oil-truck convoystraveling from Iraq to Jordan that have been attacked by U.S.aircraft were carrying military equipment.   Responding to reports that some of the convoys had beentargeted by allied aircraft, Margaret Tutwiler, thedepartment's spokeswoman, said, &quot;We have credible informationthat war materiel, including some related to Scud missiles,has been transported in convoy with civilian oil trucks.&quot; Shesaid the convoys, traveling from Iraq toward Jordan, havebeen used as cover for vehicles carrying military equipment.She said the vehicles carrying military equipment leave thehighway while still in Iraq to deliver their loads.</TEXT></DOC>
