Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FIN WNEWS FWF </CO><IN> BNK </IN><TEXT>   The chief financial officer of deeply troubled Financial Corp. of America resigned to become president of a healthy California thrift, marking the second departure of a top Financial Corp. executive in the last two months.    Victor H. Indiek, 50 years old, resigned from Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. effective Aug. 15 to become president of Far West Savings andamp; Loan Association, the main unit of Far West Financial Corp., Los Angeles. As president, Mr. Indiek succeeds David E. Blackford, who resigned effective June 30 to become a real estate consultant.    Financial Corp. is the parent of American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the nation's second-largest and most troubled thrift. Federal regulators are negotiating to provide massive assistance for Robert M. Bass Group Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, to acquire American Savings.    Mr. Indiek's resignation comes less than a week before the Aug. 1 expiration date of an exclusive negotiating agreement between Bass Group and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Officials familiar with the negotiations have said the deadline might be extended to allow time to resolve a question about how federal assistance to Bass Group will be treated under California tax laws.    Mr. Indiek's resignation follows by about two months the departure of J. Clark Coleman, an executive vice president of American Savings and the company's top trader of mortgage-backed securities. He joined Miami-based American Savings andamp; Loan Association, a unit of Montgomery, Ala.-based Kinder-Care Inc., as chief financial officer. The identically named thrifts are unrelated.    When Mr. Coleman announced his resignation, William J. Popejoy, chairman of Financial Corp., said he expected more departures of key employees to follow because of the uncertainty surrounding Financial Corp.'s future.    Neither Mr. Popejoy nor Mr. Indiek could be reached for comment yesterday.    Mr. Indiek, who also held titles as an executive vice president of Financial Corp. and a senior executive vice president of American Savings, previously served as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., Washington.    Far West Savings, based in Newport Beach, Calif., has assets of about $4 billion, far smaller than American Savings' assets of about $30 billion. The Belzberg family of Canada controls more than 50% of Far West Financial's common shares. William Belzberg, a member of the family, is chairman of both Far West Savings and Far West Financial.    &quot;Vic has groomed himself for the presidency of a major savings and loan association for more than 15 years and brings hands-on management and forward thinking leadership to our company,&quot; said Fred Kayne, president of Far West Financial. </TEXT></DOC>
