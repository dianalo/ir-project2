<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-95-0517 </DOCNO><TEXT>Major projects put forward in the original proposal were: radiation damagestudies of the heavy fermion superconductors UBe{sub 13} and UPt{sub3}; chemical substitution experiments, including CeCu{sub 6-x}M{sub x};high magnetic field specific heat measurements; search for new heavyfermion systems (HFS). A summary of results on these projects will bediscussed first, followed by additional work done during the contractperiod - some of which is still in progress.</TEXT></DOC>
