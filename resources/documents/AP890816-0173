The cancer rate among natives of the Chukotka peninsula is 2-3times higher than the national average, virtually the entirepopulation suffers from tuberculosis and 90 percent from chroniclung disease, Moscow News said.   It said the general radiation level on the peninsula was at leasttwice as high as normal and equal to the average dose received bypeople living in areas around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.   In part because of their drastically reduced immunity, theaverage lifespan of the natives, known as the Chukchi, is only 45years, Moscow News reported.   The article attributed the unusual radiation to nuclear testscarried out in the 1950s and 1960s.   ``Peaceful hunters and reindeer herders who in no wayparticipated in the conflict of the superpowers are now paying themost for big politics,'' Moscow News said.   The authors of the article, Dr. Vladimir Lupandin and historianYevdokia Gayer, said they visited one village on Chukotka where theywere told virtually every resident had cancer.   Scientists measured up to 100 times the normal amount of someradioactive elements in some deer hunters, the article said.   Infant mortality is also especially high among the natives, withup to 100 deaths per 1,000 infants, the Moscow News said.   The Chukchi, a Mongoloid people inhabiting the northeastern-mostportion of Siberia, traditionally settle in small groups and liveoff hunting and fishing.   The article in the Moscow News was one of many to appear in theSoviet media recently denouncing the conditions in which the peoplesof the Soviet Far North live.</TEXT></DOC>
