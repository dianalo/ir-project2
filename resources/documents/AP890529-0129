No one in the Palestine Liberation Organization confirmed thisreported change in its position, nor was it confirmed by othersources in Israel.   Sarid's remarks came during a stormy Parliament session on aspeech last week by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III lastweek. Baker asked Israel then to ``lay aside once and for all, theunrealistic vision of a Greater Israel'' that would include theoccupied lands.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Baker harmed Israel and thepeace process when he publicly denounced Israeli policies in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He noted that Baker broke along-standing tradition that the United States and Israel discusstheir differences privately.   One facet of a peace plan advanced by Prime Minister YitzhakShamir is for elections in the occupied territories.   On Monday, Sarid of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement, said:   ``The PLO has already agreed to elections and passed this on toWashington.''   Israel views the PLO as a terrorist organization and refuses todeal with it.   Sarid said the PLO told U.S. officials it would agree toelections under five conditions, including partial Israeli armywithdrawal and a U.S. pledge that it views the PLO as a partner inthe second stage of talks on a final settlement.   The conditions appeared an effort at compromise.   In the past the PLO has demanded complete Israeli armywithdrawal before elections. Shamir has ruled this out, but hassaid that as part of an interim autonomy agreement, the army couldpull back from Arab population centers.   If Sarid's report is accurate, it would also appear that the PLOis trying to sidestep Israel's refusal to deal with the PLO byinsisting only on American, not Israeli recognition, and only at amuch later stage of the process.   The other PLO conditions include international supervision ofelections, participation of Palestinians from Israeli-annexed eastJerusalem, and immunity for candidates, said Sarid, a member ofParliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee.   Arens said Monday in lashing out at Baker's speech, ``The imageof close relations helps the advancement of peace in the region.It's important that the Arabs understand that these are therelations between the United States and Israel. This image is alsoimportant for Israel's deterrent power.   ``I'm sure Baker didn't intend to harm Israel ... but sometimesyou hurt someone without intention.''   Referring to media descriptions of Baker's speech as balanced,Arens said: ``How can one of our allies take a balanced positionbetween us and our enemies, between us and those who attacked usfive times?''   Arens suggested Baker harmed the peace process by emphasizingU.S. and Israeli differences on a final settlement of the conflict.   Washington insists Israel return some occupied land in such asettlement. The right-wing Likud bloc to which Shamir and Arensbelong opposes all territorial compromise.   ``I'm very sorry that Baker related to the character of thefinal settlement. We are convinced, and I thought the United Stateswas also convinced that we have to concentrate on the interimagreement,'' Arens said.   He urged the United States ``not to raise the hopes of the Arabsabout the final settlement.''   Under Israel's peace plan, Palestinians elected in the ballotingwould negotiate an interim settlement of limited Palestinianself-rule in the occupied lands.   Arens' tough rhetoric appeared aimed, in part, to calm far-rightcritics of the peace plan in Likud.   Three influential Likud Cabinet ministers are waging a campaignto have the plan rejected in a Likud Central Committee meetingtentatively scheduled for June.   Shamir, head of Likud, threatened to resign if the party rejectshis initiative. Shamir rules in a coalition with the left-leaningLabor Party which backs the elections proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
