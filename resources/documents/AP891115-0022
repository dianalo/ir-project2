WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The White House says President Bush'sopposition to abortion rights is ``not subject to change,'' thoughhe will campaign next week for a pair of pro-choice HouseRepublicans.   The two, Reps. Lynn Martin of Illinois and Claudine Schneider ofRhode Island, were among four GOP women who met with Bush onTuesday to press their point that the Republican Party shouldremain open to those who don't go along with Bush's opposition tomost abortions.   ``We could see the wheels of thought going through his mind,''said Schneider. ``I think he heard us.''   The House, meanwhile, took a step in Bush's direction on thequestion of federally funded abortions.   The Appropriations Committee approved new versions of twospending bills Bush vetoed last month. The new versions comply withBush's demand that they maintain a ban on federal funding for mostabortions, including cases of rape or incest. However, one measurestill could draw Bush's objections by allowing the District ofColumbia to use local money for abortions.   Abortion rights leaders said they may continue their fight toloosen the restrictions on abortions for poor women, at least inthe Senate.   But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said it was time for thepro-choice side to accept that Bush will prevail for now and devotetheir energies toward another try next year.   ``Without the votes to overturn that veto, we have to face thefact that there's going to be a denial of funds,'' Foley said.``The president has to take responsibility for that decision.''   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidBush would speak at a fund-raising event Monday for Martin andSchneider, who are planning 1990 races for Senate seats in theirrespective states.   Both have been advocates of abortion rights. They are amongRepublicans voicing concern that the party's anti-abortion platformand identification with abortion foes hurt it in the odd-yearelections last week and may do more damage in the 1990 elections.   ``Abortion is not a test of support ... no matter what one'sposition is,'' Fitzwater said.   ``The president supports all Republicans,'' Fitzwater said. ``Hesupports Republican candidates without regard to specific positionsthat differ from him.'' He said Bush's own views ``are based on hisfirm moral beliefs and they are not subject to change.''   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who also attended the meeting, saidthe Republicans gained no commitment from Bush and did not expecthim to reverse positions. But, she said, they hoped ``there couldbe some gradations in his position'' in the future.   ``We certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about theimplications for our party,'' Snowe said. ``We want to avoidpolitical losses.''   Also attending was Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut.   Bush supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw mostabortions.   The appropriations panel approved without dissent the revisedversions of a $157 billion bill for 1990 spending on labor,education and health programs, and a bill appropriating $558million for the District of Columbia government. Bush vetoed bothlast month because of their more liberal abortion provisions.   The House's approval of the larger bill last month marked thefirst time in a decade it had voted to loosen a restriction onfederally financed abortions except in the cases where the mother'slife is in danger. But the House failed by 51 votes to overrideBush's veto.   Abortion opponents said they still objected to the D.C. bill,however, because it would permit the district government to uselocal money to pay for abortions for poor women. Bush objected toeven that financing in his veto message, and Doug Johnson, lobbyistfor the National Right to Life Committee, said the new versionwould invite yet another veto.   On still another abortion front, the House backed away from athreatened Bush veto on a foreign aid bill that includes $15million for the United Nations Population Fund, a family planningeffort that opponents charge indirectly supports coerced abortionsin China.</TEXT></DOC>
