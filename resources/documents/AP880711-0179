Understandably,most of the customers of the National Intelligence Book Centerprefer to remain anonymous.</TEXT><BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Psst! Tucked away on the sixth floor of adowntown Washington office building is a bookstore for spies, whereyou can learn how to change your identity, determine if yourtelephone is bugged, look inside the KGB or get some self-helpguidance on becoming an agent.   But you almost have to engage in espionage to find the NationalIntelligence Book Center, which specializes in books, magazines,computer software and tapes on spies, cryptography, surveillance,the CIA, the KGB and spooks of all kinds.   It is one of Washington's secrets, this whispery one-room shop.Once you find it, there are plenty of clues that this is not yourrun-of-the-mill bookstore.   Access is controlled by a high-tech security door. Callers onhold are treated to tape-recorded readings from famous spy tales.The store is open to the public only three days a week and visitorsmust check packages in lockers before entering.   There is no telling who you'll bump into among the clientele.   Elizabeth Bancroft, the store's founder and director, refuses toname her customers. They prefer to remain covert. But patronsinclude famous authors, literary editors, doctors, lawyers and, ofcourse, government officials from the United States and abroad.   One customer of Ms. Bancroft's mail-order service was said to bethe late William J. Casey, former director of the CIA and author of``The Secret War Against Hitler,'' posthumously published memoirsof his service in the CIA's World War II forerunner, the Office ofStrategic Services. Norman Mailer and Jacqueline Onassis reportedlyhave contacted the store.   ``It's a crossroads for people in the intelligence community,''says writer Jim Hougan. ``I consider myself knowledgeable in thisarea, but some of the stuff in her store is really astonishing.''   Joseph Goulden, another writer hooked on true spy tales, limitshimself to about one visit a month. ``If I went too often, I'd bebroke. I could easily spend $2,000 in there.''   Browsers _ there are about 30 or 40 a day _ often spend severalhours at the center. Ms. Bancroft said she finally had to removechairs from the room to prevent patrons from parking themselves allday.   Ms. Bancroft, a crisp, black-haired woman who turned herfascination with the netherworld of spying into her life's work,prides herself on the range of books she has compiled.   Most of the 1,400 titles are non-fiction, but the center stocksa smattering of spy fiction, such as the works of John Le Carre andIan Fleming's James Bond stories.   The store carries everything from the Soviet-inspired ``Deviland His Dart: How the CIA Is Plotting in the Third World,'' to``The Whole Spy Catalogue: an Espionage Lovers' Guide'' and DavidKahn's seminal volume on cryptography, ``The Code Breakers.''Foreign language books are also displayed, mainly Russian andFrench.   On the lighter side, there are coffee mugs displaying KGB andCIA emblems, government maps, ``James Bond's Bedside Companion,''the ``Comic Book of MI5'' and a how-to book on passing the FBI'sentrance exam. The shop doesn't stock material on explosives orsilencers.   The most popular books, Ms. Bancroft says, are from obscurepublishers: ``How To Disappear Completely And Never Be Found'' and``How To Create A New Identity.'' The latter, written by``Anonymous,'' outlines step-by-step ways to get a new driver'slicense, credit cards, birth certificate and other documents.   Among the duds: anything to do with the Iran-Contra affair.   ``I had to give some Ollie North books away because no one wasbuying them,'' Ms. Bancroft says. North, a former Marine lieutenantcolonel, has been indicted for his role in selling weapons to Iranand diverting the profits to the Nicaraguan Contras.   Bancroft, a Harvard-educated New Yorker who had worked as aprofessional fund-raiser before she plunged into the book business,started the center as a mail-order operation in her home about twoyears ago. She specialized in finding obscure books on intelligencegathering.   So successful was the operation _ people routinely showed up ather doorstep _ that she sold her house, moved into an apartment andstocked a rented office with books. She expanded into new quartersin the same building a few months ago.   Until just recently, Ms. Bancroft didn't advertise. The shopdepended on whisper-of-mouth for customers to learn of itsexistence.   Although she has received strong moral support from well-knownex-CIA officials, Ms. Bancroft says financing for the store comesfrom private investors and loans.   ``We have had people invest who are interested in the subjectmatter, but no one I know of is being funded by an intelligencegroup,'' she says.   With only one assistant, Ms. Bancroft often works 18-hour days,answering questions from customers, ordering books and wrappingpackages at the store, which started to turn a profit recently.   Bancroft has no plans to expand to a regular, street-leveloperation.   ``People like the idea that we are hidden away,'' she says.Besides, she adds, ``I am not big on dealing with the public.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 24</NOTE></DOC>
