USDA stated thatveterinary biological products produced through such processes will betreated similarly to products prepared by conventional techniques and reviewedunder its regulations in 9 CFR 101-118. USDA stated that for purposes of licensing, biologics derived by recombinantDNA techniques or developed from hybridomas may be classified into threebroad categories. The first category includes inactivated recombinant DNA-derived vaccines,bacterins, baterin-toxoids, virus subunits, or bacterial subunits. Monoclonalantibody (hybridoma) products used prophylactically, therapeutically, oras components of diagnostic kits also are included in this category. The second category includes those products containing live microorganismsthat have been modified by the addition or deletion of one or more genes.The third category of genetically-engineered veterinary biologics includesproducts using live vectors to carry recombinant-derived foreign genesthat code for immunizing antigens and/or other immune stimulants. USDAstated in its policy statement that with respect to products in the thirdcategory, characteristics of safety and transmission must be examined beforequestions and concerns dealing with safety to humans, animals, and releaseinto the environment can be answered and before such products can be consideredfor licensing. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) hasdetermined that the best approach when considering category three productsfor licensing and release is to analyze each product individually to assurethat all questions regarding safety, transmission, and other considerationsare properly addressed prior to granting any approval or license. APHIS, after reviewing its regulations in 9 CFR 101-118 for veterinarybiological products, has determined that the requirements of such regulationsare sufficient to enable the agency to obtain the types of environmental,safety, purity, potency, and efficacy data needed to properly evaluatecategory three products, prior to making a decision on the field testingand licensure of such products. APHIS has received a request under 9 CFR 103.3 for authorization to conducta limited field trial of a category three product, a live vaccinia vectoredrabies vaccine that expresses the rabies virus surface glycoprotein. Thefield trial protocol calls for orally immunizing raccoons in the wild viaa bait containing the vaccine. A copy of the sponsor's preliminary safety data and field trial protocolis available and may be obtained by contacting the person listed under.<T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT''. </T2>In deciding whether authorization will be granted to conduct the limitedfield trial, APHIS' review of data shall include but will not be limitedto the following areas: <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Human Safety </ITAG>A. Probability of human exposure. B. Possible outcomes of human exposure. C. Pathogenicity of parent virus in man. D. Effect of gene manipulation on pathogenicity in man. E. Risk associated with widespread use of the vaccine. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Ecological Concerns </ITAG>A. Extent of release into the environment. B. Persistence of the vector in the environment. C. Extent of exposure to nontarget species. D. Behavior of parent virus and vector in nontarget species. E. Potential of vector to infect nonvertebrate organisms. F. Physical and chemical factors which can affect survival, reporduction,and dispersal. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Characterization of the Vaccine Virus </ITAG>A. Characteristics of parent virus. 1. Identification, sources, and strains. 2. Reproduction and capacity for genetic transfer. B. Source, description, and function of foreign genetic material. C. Method of accomplishing genetic modification. D. Genetic stability, expression, and potential for recombination of thevaccine virus. E. Advantages and disavantages of the modified virus compared to conventionalproducts. F. Comparison of the modified organisms to parental properties. G. Route of administration. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Animal Safety </ITAG>A. Fate of the vaccine in target and nontarget species. B. Potential of shed and/or spread from vaccinate to contact target andnontarget animals. C. Reversion to virulence resulting from back passage in animals. D. Effect of overdose in target and potential nontarget species. E. Relative safety when compared to conventional vaccines. F. The extent of the host range and the degree of mobility of the vector.G. Safety in pregnant animals and to offspring nursing vaccinated animals.If approval is granted for the sponsor to conduct a limited field trial,APHIS shall publish a notice of availability of an environmental assessmentin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>30 days prior to the commencement of the fieldtesting. <ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 29th day of December 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James Glosser, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">December 29, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-40 Filed 1-3-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-34-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
