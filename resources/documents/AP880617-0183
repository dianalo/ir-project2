In the broadcasts, which began Thursday night and were monitoredby the FCC, the Cubans said they would continue broadcastingthrough Sunday night on the frequencies as part of a music festivalon the Caribbean island.   The FCC said the Cubans did the same thing a year ago as part ofthe same music festival, but the National Association ofBroadcasters said the transmissions were ``clearly a show offorce'' in response to a Senate proposal to beam Americantelevision programs to Cuba.   The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday approvedspending $7.5 million to start a U.S. government TV service to Cubato supplement Radio Marti, which has been broadcasting to thecommunist-run nation for three years.   When Radio Marti was being debated on Capitol Hill in 1983,Cuban leader Fidel Castro fired up powerful transmitters and beamedmusic and political programs to the United States, interfering withbroadcasts by U.S. radio stations as far away as Salt Lake City,Utah.   The NAB has raised concerns about TV Marti, citing thepossibility of retaliatory jamming by Cuba of American AM stationsand interference to southern Florida TV stations from the TV Martisignal itself.   The FCC said the Cubans broadcast Thursday from about 7 p.m. or8 p.m. to 12:16 a.m. at 150 kilowatts of power on the 1040 and 1160kilohertz frequencies. The Cubans broadcast at that power duringthe day, but ordinarily they lower their power at night so as notto interfere with two U.S. stations that use those frequencies,said FCC spokeswoman Rosemary Kimball.   She said the two stations whose signals might have been affectedby the broadcasts were WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, which uses the 1040frequency, and KSL in Salt Lake City, which broadcasts on 1160.   John Dehnel, chief engineer at KSL, said the station received nocomplaints of interference from listeners Thursday night, ``but itusually takes two or three nights for people to realize it's notsomething wrong with their radio, that it's interference.''   Kimball said the Cuban broadcasts Thursday night were aimed attourists at the Cuban beaches and that no political programming washeard.</TEXT></DOC>
