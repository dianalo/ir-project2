Texas Easternstates that it intends to commence construction activities, upon receiptof timely authorization, which would enable it to receive the Canadiangas supplies commencing November 1, 1990. The estimated cost of the proposedfacilities is $5,110,000, which Texas Eastern would initially finance fromfunds on hand or short term borrowings. Permanent financing would be undertakenas part of Texas Eastern's overall long-term financing program at a laterdate. Texas Eastern also states that the incremental cost of service ofthe proposed facilities would be rolled-in to Texas Eastern's system costof service.Texas Eastern states that the gas purchase agreements underlying the Canadiannatural gas for Texas Eastern's sysem supplies are the sales agreementsdated November 2 and November 3, 1986, between ProGas Limited (ProGas)and Texas Eastern providing for the sale of Daily Contract Quantities (DCQ)of 50,000 Mcf and 51,000 Mcf of natural gas at the Niagara Falls deliverypoint. Texas Eastern also states that ProGas and Texas Eastern have agreedthat certain quantities of the total DCQ of 101,000 Mcf of natural gaswould be released and sold directly by ProGas to North Jersey and Northeastfor their proposed cogeneration plants, in Sayreville, New Jersey, andBellingham, Massachusetts, as reflected in the Amending Agreement betweenProGas and Texas Eastern dated September 30, 1988, which merges the November2 sales agreement into the November 3 sales agreement. Texas Eastern statesthat under the sales agreement Texas Eastern's DCQ is 101,000 Mcf lessthe sum of the Northeast and North Jersey DCQ. As a result of combiningthe two ProGas sales agreements and releasing a portion to the cogenerationpurchasers, the resulting Texas Eastern DCQ is 29,000 Mcf of natural gaswhen both of the cogeneration plants are in full operation. Texas Eastern states that during the Winter Period of any contract year,the DCQ of Texas Eastern under the gas sales agreement with ProGas wouldbe increased by the quantity of gas which is not purchased by Northeastand North Jersey and which becomes available for sale by ProGas to TexasEastern for a period of not less than two weeks. Texas Eastern also statesthat it is necessary for the cogeneration plants to shut-down each yearfor maintenance purposes for a period of three to four weeks. Accordingto Texas Eastern, if quantities of natural gas available to the two cogenerationplants are not taken by them during the remainder of the year, those quantitieswould be available to Texas Eastern on an interruptible basis and wouldbe eligible for sale as special purchase gas under the provisions of theSales Agreement and Special Marketing Agreement. Texas Eastern furtherstates that the Special Marketing Agreement provides for sales of naturalgas imported and released by Texas Eastern under the Sales Agreement fordirect purchase from ProGas by third parties. Payments would be made bymarketers directly to ProGas. The available quantities would be those thatTexas Eastern does not schedule for delivery under the Sales Agreementand would be sold at freely negotiated, competitive prices in Texas Eastern'smarkets. The National Energy Board of Canada has authorized the exportation of the101,000 Mcf referred to herein by License Nos. GL-80 and GL-81. Texas Easternalso states that it has applications pending before the Economic RegulatoryAdministration (ERA) in ERA Docket Nos. 82-05-NG and 85-19-NG to importup to 50,000 Mcf and 51,000 Mcf of natural gas per day to be purchasedfrom ProGas to Niagara Falls.
