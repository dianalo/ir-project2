XIV_Termination This Final Judgment will expire on the tenth anniverary of the date ofits entry. XV_Public Interest Entry of this Final Judgment is in the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: <T2>XXXXXXX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Court approval subject to procedures of Antitrust Procedures and PenaltiesAct, 15 U.S.C. 16.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">United States District Judge. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Competitive Impact Statement </ITAG>The United States, pursuant to section 2(b) of the Antitrust Proceduresand Penalties Act (``APPA'') 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), files this CompetitiveImpact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted forentry in this civil antitrust proceeding. I_Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding Contemporaneously with this statement, the United States filed a civilantitrust Complaint under Section 15 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 25,alleging that two proposed partnership joint ventures between Asea BrownBoveri Inc. and Westinghouse Electric Corporation (``Westinghouse'') wouldviolate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18. The Complaint namesas defendants Westinghouse and Asea Brown Boveri, Inc. and its parent company,ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.\1\<NOTE/> The Complaint alleges that the effects of the joint venturesmay be substantially to lessen competition in the United States marketsfor power transformers, converter transformers, steam turbine generatorequipment and steam turbine generator service. The Complaint seeks suchinjunctive relief and relief by way of preservation of assets and divestitureas is appropriate to prevent the anticompetitive effects of the joint venturesand to maintain existing competitive conditions in these markets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Hereinafter, the term ``ABB'' means ABB Asea Brown BoveriLtd. and Asea Brown Boveri Inc. Together with the filing of this Competitive Impact Statement, the UnitedStates and defendants have filed a stipulation by which they consent tothe entry of a proposed Final Judgment designed to eliminate the anticompetitiveeffects of the proposed joint ventures. Under the proposed Final Judgment,as explained more fully below, ABB would be required, within six months,to sell any and all interest it has or shall acquire in all the transformerbusinesses of ABB Electric, Inc. in Waukesha, Wisconsin (``Waukesha business'').If it does not do so, a trustee apponted by the Court would be empoweredfor an additional six months to sell the Waukesha business. If the trusteeis unable to do so, the Court may extend the trustee period or enter suchother orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purposeof the trust. The proposed Final Judgment would also require Westinghouse, within sixmonths, to sell its converter transformer and related smoothing reactortechnology, or grant the right to use and to license that technology toan eligible person. If it does not do so, the Court would be empoweredto appoint a trustee to accomplish such a sale or grant. Under the proposed Final Judgment, Westinghouse would be further requiredto release General Electric Company from its covenant not to compete withWestinghouse in power transformers, which General Electric agreed to inconnection with the sale of its power transformer business to Westinghousein 1986. The proposed Final Judgment would also enjoin, for a period of 10 years,Westinghouse and ABB from combining their steam turbine generator equipmentor steam turbine generator service businesses in the United States. The United States and defendants have stipulated that the proposed FinalJudgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA, unless the UnitedStates withdraws its consent. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment wouldterminate the action, except that the Court would retain jurisdiction toconstrue, modify, or enforce the provisions of the proposed Final Judgmentand to punish violations of the proposed Final Judgment. II_Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation ABB, with headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, is the world's largest producerof electric power equipment. Westinghouse, with headquarters in Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania, is also one of the world's leading producers of electricpower equipment. ABB and Westinghouse have agreed to form two partnershipjoint ventures,\2\<NOTE/> one relating to electric power transmission and distributionproducts, and the other relating to electric power generation products.The power transmission and distribution joint venture would combine, amongother thing, the companies' respective power transformer and convertertransformer businesses in the United States. The power generation jointventure would combine defendants' respective steam turbine generator equipmentand steam turbine generator service businesses in the United States. Defendantswould transfer certain manufacturing plants, technology, or other assetsto the new joint venture companies. ABB also would pay Westinghouse morethan $500 million in cash. Each of the joint ventures would be conditionedon the performance of the important terms of the other joint venture. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Defendants agreed to a preliminary Memorandum of Understandingin April of 1988. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Power Transformers </ITAG>Power transformers are static devices used to transfer electric energyfrom one circuit to another by induction.\3\<NOTE/> They are used by electric power utilities to convert lowvoltage electricity produced by a power generating unit to higher voltagesthat are more efficiently carried over transmission lines, and to reducevoltages between transmission and distribution lines to deliver electricitysafely to utility customers. Investor owned utilities and utilities ownedand operated by federal, state, county and municipal governments are theprincipal purchasers of power transformers in the United States. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ As used herein, power transformers refers to transformerswith minimum OA power ratings of 40 megavolt-amperes (`'MVA'') or higher.The Complaint alleges that the sale of power transformers constitutes aline of commerce and a relevant product market, and that the United Statesis a section of the country and a relevant geographic market in which powertransformers are sold within the meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.Successful entry into the power transformer market is difficult becauseof the cost and time required to develop the necessary technology to producepower transformers, to construct the physical facilities required for productionof power transformers, to assemble the necessary technical, sales and servicepersonnel, and to become a qualified source of power transformers for domesticelectric utilities. ABB was the largest seller of power transformers in the United States in1987. In that same year, Westinghouse was the second leading seller ofpower transformers in the United States. In terms of unit sales, the 1987power transformer market shares of ABB and Westinghouse were 27 percentand 26 percent, respectively. The Complaint alleges that the United Statesmarket for power transformers is highly concentrated. Based on 1987 unitssales, the proposed combination would increase the Herfindahl-HirschmanIndex (``HHI'') \4\<NOTE/>by over 1386 to 3264. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The HHI is a measure of market concentration calculatedby squaring the market share of each firm competing in the market and thensumming the resulting numbers. for example, for a market consisting offour firms with shares of 30, 30, 20, and 20 percent, the HHI is 2600 (302+302+ 202+ 202^ 2600). The HHI, which takes into account the relative sizeand distribution of the firms in a market, ranges from virtually zero to10,000. The index approaches zero when a market is occupied by a largenumber of firms of relatively equal size and reaches its maximum of 10,000when a market is controlled by a single firm. The HHI increases both asthe number of firms in the market decreases and as the disparity in sizebetween the leading firms and the remaining firms increases. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Converter Transformers </ITAG>The manufacture of converter transformers involves a technology differentfrom that used in the manufacture of power transformers. Converter transformersare sold primarily to companies that design high voltage direct current(HVDC) systems, which are used in transmitting electricity over long distancetransmission lines. They are also used to connect asynchronous transmissionsystems. Converter transformers are major cost items in HVDC systems.The Complaint alleges that sale of converter transformers constitutes aline of commerce and a relevant product market, and that the United Statesis a section of the country and a relevant geographic market in which convertertransformers are sold, within the meaning of section 7 of the Clayton Act.ABB is the largest seller of converter transformers in the United Statesand, since 1981, has accounted for more than 50 percent of all convertertransformers sold in the United States. General Electric Company was amajor competitor of ABB until it sold its converter transformer technology(and related smoothing reactor technology \5\<NOTE/>) to Westinghouse in 1986. Westinghouse is one of only a fewcompanies possessing such technology since 1986, Westinghouse has beenone of only four companies bidding to supply converter transformers inthe United States. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ A smoothing reactor is a device used to introduce reactanceinto a circuit for the purpose of reducing the alternating current componentin a direct current power system. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Steam Turbine Generator Equipment </ITAG>Steam turbine generator equipment consists of a turbine and a connectinggenerator. Steam passes through the turbine causing the generator rotorand an attached electromagnet to rotate within a stator, generating electicity.Steam turbine generator equipment is the principal means by which nuclearand fossil-fueled utility plants generate electricity from steam energyproduced by nuclear reactor or conventional boiler operations. The principalpurchasers of steam turbine generator equipment are utilities. Steam turbinegenerator equipment is also sold to cogenerators, independent power producersand industrial customers. The Complaint alleges that the sale of steam turbine generator equipmentconstitutes a line of commerce and a relevant product market, and thatthe United States is a section of the country and a relevant geographicmarket in which steam turbine generator equipment is sold within the meaningof section 7 of the Clayton Act. Successful entry into the steam turbinegenerator equipment market in the United States is difficult because ofthe cost and time required to develop the necessary technology to producesteam turbine generator equipment, to construct the physical facilitiesrequired for production and service of steam turbine generator equipment,to assemble the necessary technical, sales and service personnel and tobecome a qualified source of steam turbine generator equipment for domesticelectric utilities. In the period 1983 through 1987, total sales of steam turbine generatorequipment in the United States were approximately $442 million. Westinghouseand ABB were the first and third largest suppliers of steam turbine generatorequipment in the United States in that period, with market shares of 43percent and 19 percent, respectively. The Complaint alleges that the United States market for steam turbine generatorequipment is highly concentrated. The proposed joint venture would createa firm controlling approximately 62 percent of steam turbine generatorequipment sold in the United States, based on sales in the period 1983through 1987. The proposed combination would increase the HHI by 1566 to4693.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Steam Turbine Generator Service    </ITAG>Owners of steam turbine generator equipment may at times require equipmentrepairs involving the replacement or retrofitting of major components,or equipment modernization efforts aimed at significant efficiency enhancementsor life extensions. Such steam turbine generator service is provided principallyto private and public utility companies. In the past several years manufacturersof steam turbine generator equipment have begun bidding to provide suchservice not only for equipment of their own manufacture but also for equipmentmanufactured by others.    The Complaint alleges that the sale of steam turbine generator serviceconstitutes a line of commerce and a relevant product market, and thatthe United States is a section of the country and a relevant geographicmarket in which steam turbine generator service is provided within themeaning of section 7 of the Clayton Act. Successful entry into the steamturbine generator service market is difficult because of the cost and timerequired to develop the necessary technology to provide steam turbine generatorservice, to construct the physical facilities required for provision ofsuch service, to assemble the necessary technical, sales and service personnel,and to become a qualified source for steam turbine generator service fordomestic electric utilities.    The Complaint alleges that the United States market for steam turbine generatorservice is highly concentrated. Westinghouse and ABB are leading suppliersof steam turbine generator service in the United States. Only five companieshave provided such steam turbine generator service in the United Statesduring the period from 1983 through 1987.III_Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment    The United States brought this action because the effect of these jointventures may be substantially to lessen competition in the United Statesmarkets for power transformers, converter transformers, steam turbine generatorequipment and steam turbine generator service, in violation of section7 of the Clayton Act. As described in detail below, the provisions of theFinal Judgment are designed to eliminate the anticompetitive effects ofthe proposed joint ventures.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Remedy as to Power Transformers    </ITAG>The proposed Final Judgment contains two remedies that will preserve thecompetition in power transformers that the joint venture of defendantswould otherwise eliminate. First, the proposed Final Judgment requiresABB, within six months of its filing, to divest itself of its power transformerplant at Waukesha, Wisconsin, which is its only power transformer facilityin the United States.\6\<NOTE/> If ABB cannot accomplish the required divestiture withinthat period, the proposed Final Judgment provides that, upon applicationby the United States, the Court shall appoint a trustee to effect the divestiture.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ ABB also manufactures power transformers at plants inCanada and Europe. The proposed Final Judgment provides that the Waukesha business must bedivested in such a way as to satisfy the United States that this businesscan and will be operated by the purchaser as a viable, ongoing businessthat can compete effectively in the power transformer market. ABB musttake all reasonable steps necessary to accomplish the divestiture and shallcooperate with bona fide prospective purchasers and, if one is appointed,the trustee.        In a trustee is appointed, the proposed Final Judgment provides that defendantswill pay all costs and expenses of the trustee. The trustee's commissionwill be structured so as to provide an incentive for the trustee basedon the price obtained and the speed with which divestiture is accomplished.After the trustee's appointment becomes effective, the trustee will filemonthly reports with the parties and the Court setting forth the trustee'sefforts to accomplish divestiture. At the end of six months, if the trusteehas not accomplished the divestiture, the trustee and the parties willmake recommendations to the Court and the Court shall thereafter entersuch orders as it shall deem appropriate in order to carry out the purposeof the trust, including extending the trust or the term of the trustee'sappointment.    The proposed Final Judgment provides the United States an opportunity toreview any proposed divestiture before it occurs. If the United Statesrequests information from defendants to assess a proposed sale, the salemay not be consummated until at least 20 days after defendants suppliedthe information. If the United States objects to a proposed divestiture,the sale may not be completed.    The proposed Final Judgment provides that until the required divestiturehas been accomplished, ABB must preserve and maintain the Waukesha businessas a viable and active competitor. ABB must hold the Waukesha business,including all books and records, separate and apart from its other assetsand businesses, and must maintain the Waukesha business as a saleable andeconomically viable, ongoing business.    The second element of the power transformer relief in the proposed FinalJudgment provides for the restoration of General Electric Company as acompetitor in the United States power transformer market. In 1986 GeneralElectric sold most of its power transformer business to Westinghouse; thesubstantial terms of this transaction are reflected in an agreement betweenthe parties dated November 18, 1986. As a part of that transaction GeneralElectric agreed not to compete for the sale of power transformers of 40MVA and above for a period of ten years; that period expires in November,1996.\7\<NOTE/> General Electric again desires to compete in the power transformermarket. On February 9, 1989, it agreed with Westinghouse to an amendmentto the 1986 agreement which abrogates the covenant not to compete and alsogrants to General Electric a license to use the technology relating topower transformers that General Electric sold to Westinghouse. The amendmentwill become effective upon the commencement of operations by the Westinghouse-ABBjoint venture. The proposed Final Judgment requires Westinghouse to consummatethat agreement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ General Electric continues to manufacture power transformersof less than 40 MVA at its plant in Rome, Georgia.    Thus, the proposed Final Judgment requires the divestiture of the assetsused by ABB in the manufacture of power transformers in the United States.In addition, it will permit General Electric Company, which in years pasthas been the largest United States manufacturer of electric equipment,again to become a competitor in the power transformer market. The combinationof the two elements of relief will restore the competition in power transformersthat would otherwise be eliminated by the joint venture of Westinghouseand ABB.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Remedy as to Converter Transformers</ITAG>In its 1986 agreement with General Electric Company, Westinghouse alsopurchased General Electric's technology relating to converter transformers.That technology enabled Westinghouse to enter the converter transformermarket and to begin bidding to supply converter transformers for use inhigh voltage direct current (HVDC) systems. As alleged in the Complaint,Westinghouse and ABB are two of only a few firms possessing such technologyand currently bidding to supply converter transformers in the United States.The proposed Final Judgment requires Westinghouse to sell or to grant theright to use and license its converter transformer (and related smoothingreactor) technology. The sale or license would be subject to any pre-existingrights held by any third party with respect to the relevant technology.The sale or license is to be made to a person, for whom it is demonstratedto plaintiff's sole satisfaction, that intends to sell and is capable ofselling converter transformers in the United States. Westinghouse is tohold separate and not disclose to ABB the technology pending completionof the requried disposition.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The February 9, 1989 amendment to the Westinghouse-GeneralElectric agreement also permits General Electric to reenter the convertertransformer market and grants to General Electric a license to use theconverter transformer technology it sold to Westinghouse in 1986. Thattransaction is independent of the requirement of the proposed Final Judgmentrelating to converter transformer technology. Plaintiff takes no positionat this time as to whether that transaction satisfies the converter transformerrequirement of the proposed Final Judgment.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Remedies as to Steam Turbine Generator Equipment and Steam TurbineGenerator Service</ITAG>The proposed Final Judgment enjoins and restrains Westinghouse and ABB,for a period of 10 years, from entering into their proposed joint venture,or any similar agreement, relating to steam turbine generator equipmentand steam turbine generator service without the prior written approvalof the Antitrust Division.IV_Remedies Available to Potential Private LitigantsSection 4 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 15) provides that any person whohas been injured as a result of conduct prohibited by the antitrust lawsmay bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages theperson has suffered, as well as costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. Entryof the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringingof any private antitrust damage action. Under the provisions of sectdion5(a) of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 16(a)), the proposed Final Judgmenthas no <T3>prima facie</T3> effect in any subsequent private lawsuit that maybe brought against defendants.V_Procedure Available for Modification of the Proposed Final JudgmentThe United States and defendants have stipulated that the proposed FinalJudgment may be entered by the Court after compliance with the provisionsof the APPA, provided that the United States has not withdrawn its consent.The APPA conditions entry upon the Court's determination that the proposedFinal Judgment is in the public interest.The APPA provides a period of at least 60 days preceding the effectivedate of the proposed Final Judgment within which any person may submitto the United States written comments regarding the proposed Final Judgment.Any person who wishes to comment should do so within 60 days of the dateof publication of this Competitive Impact Statement in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The United States will evaluate the comments,determine whether it should withdraw its consent, and respond to comments.The comments and the response of the United States will be filed with theCourt and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Written comments should be submitted to: Ralph T. Giordano, Chief, AntitrustDivision, New York Field Office, United States Department of Justice, 26Federal Plaza, Room 3630, New York, NY 10278-0096.VI_Alternatives to the Proposed Final JudgmentWith respect to the power generation joint venture agreement, the injunctionin the proposed Final Judgment prohibiting Westinghouse and ABB from combiningtheir respective steam turbine generator equipment and steam turbine generatorservice businesses provides all the relief that could be obtained by theUnited States with respect to that joint venture after a full trial onthe merits.With respect to the transmission and distribution joint venture agreement,an alternative to settling this action pursuant to the proposed Final Judgmentwould be for the United States to seek preliminary and permanent injunctionsagainst consummation of the joint venture agreement that relates to, amongother things, the market for power transformers and converter transformers.The United States rejected this alternative because the sale required underthe proposed Final Judgment of ABB's Waukesha business will establish aviable, independent competitor in the power transformer market in the UnitedStates. The Waukesha plant is ABB's only power transformer facility inthe United States and manufactures a substantial range of the sizes ofpower transformers that sells in the United States. ABB manufactures largersizes that it sells in the United States at plants in other countries.A buyer which, like ABB, also makes large power transformers at plantsin other countries, will assume a similar position in the United Statesmarket as that now held by ABB. Whether or not the purchaser of Waukeshaproduces large power transformers, however, Westinghouse's release of GeneralElectric Company from its covenant not to compete in the United Statesin the manufacture and sale of power transformers will likely result inGeneral Electric's reentry as a viable, independent competitor in the powertransformer market in the United States.With respect to the converter transformer market, the sale or grant ofthe right to use and license Westinghouse's converter transformer and smoothingreactor technology will facilitate new entry into that market. That transactionwill duplicate the transaction that brought Westinghouse into the convertertransformer market.The United States is therefore satisfied that the proposed Final Judgmentfully resolves the anticompetitive effects of the proposed joint venturesalleged in the complaint. Further, although the proposed Final Judgmentmay not be entered until the criteria established by the Antitrust Proceduresand Penalties Act (15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h)) have been satisfied, the publicwill benefit immediately from the safeguards in the proposed Final Judgmentbecause defendants have agreed to comply with the terms of the Judgmentpending its entry by the Court.VII_Determinative DocumentsAmendment 3 to the 1986 Asset Purchase Agreement between General ElectricCompany and Westinghouse Electric Corporation, dated February 9, 1989,and the 1986 agreement itself are determinative documents within the meaningof the APPA that were considered by the United States in formulating theproposed Final Judgment. Accordingly, these documents are filed with thisCompetitive Impact Statement. However, insofar as the contracts containconfidential, commercially sensitive information relating to the pricespaid for the various transfers of rights, that information has been redacted.The United States is prepared to file unredacted contracts with the Court,under seal, at its request.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated:<T2>XXXXXXX</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ralph T.
