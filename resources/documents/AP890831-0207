The U.S. government allocated $54.9 million for cocaineinterdiction and police training programs for the fiscal year 1989for all countries south of the United States before President Bushannounced a $65 million emergency package for Colombia's anti-drugwar.   The U.S. Congress allocated to Bolivia $10 million for fiscal1989, $5 million less than in 1988. A single planeload of cocainefrom Bolivia to Colombia _ usually about 14,500 pounds _ would fetch$10 million for the shipper.   Bolivian anti-drug police trained by U.S. soldiers and assistedby members of the U.S. Border Patrol and American agents havedestroyed three cocaine labs and 5,723 cocaine paste processingpits, compared to 3,542 pits in 1988.   But vast areas of the Bolivian tropical lowlands are beyond theirreach and traffickers' planes fly cocaine from the northern regionsof Bolivia to Colombia or Brazil without interference.   At least 60 U.S. experts operate in Bolivia alongside 1,050Bolivian anti-drug police.   Ecuador is becoming an important money laundering and traffickingcenter in South America. Cocaine shipments for the United States andEurope have been discovered in everything from canned fruit to woodand handicrafts. While coca-leaf production is relatively small inEcuador, traffickers are using that Andean country as a transitpoint for drugs, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) says.   Police estimate that $200 million to $400 million was launderedor invested in Ecuador last year. The United States provides Ecuadorwith $1 million a year for interdiction activities.   ``As pressure increases in Colombia and Peru, cocaine traffickingwill increase in Ecuador because traffickers will move to thecountry with the least amount of pressure,'' said William Fernandez,a U.S. DEA station chief for Ecuador.   Newspapers in Ecuador have expressed concern in editorials aboutthe danger of corruption of judges and government officials by drugcartels.   In Ecuador's most publicized case so far, two judges signed anorder for the release from jail of an important drug trafficker. Thejudges then fled into hiding. One was captured later with nearly$20,000 officials said he apparently had received as a payoff. Theother judge and the trafficker are still at large.   The security threat in Peru is concentrated in the expandinginsurgency of the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla organization thatin the last two years has received millions of dollars from itsinvolvement in the drug trade. The money has allowed Shining Path tobetter arm itself and is the principal reason the Peruviangovernment is concerned about the drug trade.   At the same time, corruption of lower-level officials and policein Peru's Huallaga Valley hampers government efforts to wipe out thecocaine trade in the jungle region.   In the campaign for Bolivia's national elections this year, somecongressional candidates received backing and money from cocainetraffickers.   Bolivian traffickers also have even staked out whole towns orareas as their own.   When police tried recently to capture Bolivian and Colombiantraffickers in the town of Santa Ana, hundreds of townspeople cameto the traffickers's defense and forced the police to leave. Thetown is considered a haven for traffickers.   In San Borja, a cocaine trafficking center, police and U.S.agents tried to confiscate airplanes that had small traces ofcocaine, but thousands of area residents forced them out.   Cocaine corruption has reached high places in the Boliviangovernment in years pase. A right-wing government installed after amilitary coup in 1980 was backed by cocaine traffickers.   Luis Arce Gomez, that government's minister of the interior, isunder indictment in Miami on drug trafficking charges.   Bolivia's new president, Paz Zamora, says several hundred milliondollars is needed to combat the cocaine trade in Bolivia.   ``We can win the war,'' he said, ``but we must change the focusso that the war is backed by the people of the country.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon AMs Sept. 4</NOTE></DOC>
