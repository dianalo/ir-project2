<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-28-0642 </DOCNO><TEXT>The deuterodesulfurization of thiophene was investigated using selectedMoS{sub 2} and reduced molybdenum sulfide (Chevrel phase) catalysts.The extent of deuterium incorporation into thiophene and into specificdesulfurization products (hydrogen sulfide, butadiene, and butenes) wasdetermined at 400{sup 0}C for thiophene conversions near 4%. UnpromotedMoS{sub 2} introduced up to 10 times more deuterium into thiophene thandid the promoted catalysts (including the Chevrel phase materials). Forall catalysts, H{sub 2}S was formed almost exclusively (typically 90+%),with only small amounts of HDS and D{sub 2}S being detected. Except forthe unpromoted MoS{sub 2} catalyst, the deuterium distributions determinedfor the cis- and trans-2-butene products were nearly identical; the deuteriumdistribution found for 1-butene was distinct. A mechanism of thiophenehydrodesulfurization can be proposed in which butadiene is the initialdesulfurized reaction product. The hydrogen available for hydrogen sulfideformation is derived via hydrogen exchange with thiophene. 23 references.</TEXT></DOC>
