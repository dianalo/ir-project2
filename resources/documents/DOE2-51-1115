<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-1115 </DOCNO><TEXT>A flow instability has been observed in a rectangular thin conductingwall duct in MHD experiments at ANL's ALEX facility. It developed ina side layer jet attached to a side wall parallel to the applied B-field.The nature of the instability resembles very strongly that of a classiclaminar instability in ordinary fluid mechanics. The phenomenon is distinguishedfrom ordinary turbulence by its strong periodicity and its lack of smallscale structure. A preliminary identification of the factors which mayinfluence the instability has been made. For the conditions and testsection geometry reported here, the instability appears at an approximatelyconstant critical Reynolds number 2650 andless; Re{sub cr} andless; 5100, independentof Hartmann number in the range 2700 andless; M andless; 5400. 6 refs., 18 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
