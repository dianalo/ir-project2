If die Apple PostScript device usesApple-format fonts and the Adobe device uses Adobc-format fonts, you have areal problem.andM;Apple expects to develop an answer to this problem.andP;  The preferred solutionwould be a utility program that converts Apple-format fonts into downloadableAdobe-format fonts.andP;  In concept, users would have one font library on theirMacs.andP;  The same font outlines would be used for screen display, for QuickDrawprinter output, for Apple PostScript printer output and (via a conversionprogram that would be invisible to the user) as downloadable fonts on AdobePostScript printers.andM;Adobe, if you recall, has already countered by announcing its own TypeManager (ATM) font technology, which will allow Adobe-format outline fonts tobe displayed on the Macintosh screen and to be used to drive QuickDraw outputdevices that are driven via a software Ku, running in a host Macintosh.andM;Adobe Postscript printers.andP;  Although Apple expects that its customers willmigrate towards the Apple Post- ' Script printers, it rectsognizes that somecustomers will prefer Adobe PostScript machines using Adobe fonts.andP;  For thisreason, it will continue to offer both Apple and Adobe PostScript printersfor as long as there is sufficient customer demand for both.andP;  It has, infact, signed a new PostScript product development agreement with Adobe.andM;Why Apple PostScript? Apples decision to develop its own PostScript iscertain to be controversial.andP;  Why is Apple doing this? One incentive must bethe fact that it will not have to pay Adobe royalties on Apple PostScriptmachines.andP;  However, with the volume discounts that Apple gets from Adobe, wedoubt that this was die deciding factor.andP;  Rather, we think that Apple wantsto control all of its core technology-induding imaging models and fonttechnology.andP;  It also wants to be able to provide a single font format thatcan drive all Apple displays and output devices.andM;Customers with heterogeneous (mixed Mac, PC and/or Unix workstation)environments are not likely to be thrilled by this.andP;  They already face asituation in which Apple ii adopting its own font technology and Microsoft islikely to do the same.andP;  PostScript and PostScript fonts remain a commonstandard that both camps support.andP;  Now Appk will be moving Apple PostScriptinto the Apple Royal font world.andM;This is one reason why many Macintosh users may continue to prefer AdobePostScript printers, which can be driven by PCs and Unix workstations as wellas Macs, to Apple PostScript machines, which are likely to be essentiallyMac-specific.andM;Apple strategies.andP;  In typical Apple fashion, the decision to build a clonestrikes us as being inward-looking rather than outward-looking.andP;  We havealways wondered why Apple was not more aggressive in selling LaserWritersinto die PC market.andP;  Apple dearly dominates the Macintosh PostScript printermarket.andP;  We think that it could have done much more to move its printers intoPC and mixed Mac/PC installations.andM;Apple makes healthy profit margins on LaserWriters.andP;  Why not sell diem to PCusers as well as Mac users? Moreover, you would think that placingLaserWriters in PC shops would be an attractive means of getting a foot inthe door.andP;  IBM put an Apple LocalTalk interface on its PostScript printer;why hasn't Apple put a Centronics parallel port on its LaserWriters?andM;The move to Apple (rather than Adobe) PostScript printers is not somethingyou would do if you were concerned with selling the machines to nonApplesites.andM;Consequences.andP;  Somelikely effects of Apples decision (in no special order):andM;* It legitimizes PostScript clones.andP;  If the company that put Adobe PostScriptprinters on the map can move to clone technology, why shouldn't others?andM;* It should open up the Macintosh Adobe PostScript market.andP;  If customersbelieve that Apple's heart is in its own PostScript printers, the Apple brandon an Adobe PostScript device may carry less weight than it has.andM;* It will certainly reduce the price of Adobe stock.andP;  Not only is Adobe'slargest customer migrating to PostScript clones, but almost 1/6 of theauthorized Adobe stock will be put on the market.andM;* It should help to strengthen the market position of Apples Royal fontformat.andP;  More printers that can use the Royal font format means morecustomers for Royal-foffnat font?, which means more incentive for fontvendors to convert their fonts to this format.andM;* Typesetters, printers and others who accept PostScript files will beunhappy, because Apple is fragmenting the PostScript market.andP;  If Apple isable to supply a Royal-to-PostScript font converter, service bureaus willstill have to know which fonts were used to create the file.andP;  If it wascreated using Apple fonts, the customer will have to send the fonts alongwith the job.andP;  Since the only way to use Apple fonts on an Adobe device is toinclude the fonts with the job, there could be a real incentive for rampantcopying of Apple format fonts.andP;  Apple will certainly have to deal with thisproblem.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
