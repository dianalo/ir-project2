Evening Post on response to oil spills:   If anything good can be said to come from the three recent oilspills, it was government's quick and effective cleanup response.   What happened in Rhode Island _ and in Delaware and Texas _ wasin dramatic contrast to the spill in Valdez ... when Exxonploddingly presumed to clean up after itself. ...   The success and speed of response to the Rhode Island spillindicates that cleanup is better coordinated by government handsthan the slow, sticky hands of the oil industry.   If the government had delayed action as usual, to determine thefault, the resulting enviornmental damage to the sensitive marshareas surrounding Narragansett Bay would have been more severe.Instead, it was a case of cleanup first, fault and fines later. Thatshould be the prototype for subsequent spills.   Prompt cleanup, however, was not enought for Delaware Gov.Michael Castle, who was ``more interested in prevention thanresponse.'' Castle has a point.   While government efforts to contain the dregs, plus the oilindustry's recent announcement of a multimillion-dollarspill-response program are both commendable, making sure thesemesses don't happen in the first place is still the key.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 17   Los Angeles Times on offshore oil drilling:   There will be considerable debate in the U.S. Senate soon overthe level of oil imports. But once the rhetoric is over, senatorscan vote with a clear conscience for a one-year moratorium on oilexploration and production in the outer continenal shelf, includingthe entire California coast. ...   The House-approved moratorium obviously comes in reaction to theExxon Valdez accident in Alaska in March and more recent tankerspills in the East.   Critics claim the legislation is overkill, since offshore oilproduction does not necessarily lead to tanker spills.   But oil in the water is oil in the water. The year's delay mayfinally force Congress and the administration to honestly weigh thebenefits of offshore oil production against the liabilities withinthe context of a real energy policy. ...   There will be more time to consider replacing dirty oil withcleaner-burning natural gas. Officials can factor in the oil savingsfrom the use of alternative fuels in autos, as proposed in thepresident's amendments to the Clean Air Act.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 14   Peninsula Daily News, Port Angeles, Wash., on militaryprocurement:   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney understands where the real militarysavings can be found. That is in procurement. Defense buying willaccount for more than $60 billion of this year's $305 billiondefense budget.   The problem, of course, is how to get at those potential savings.Any number of Defense officials before Cheney have tried tostreamline the procurement process, and failed.   It is the Gordian knot of the Defense establishment. And, asCheney noted ... in calling for reform, Alexander the Great's fabledsingle-stroke solution _ simply cutting the knot _ does not apply tothis 20th century problem.   Cheney says he has no ``quick fix'' for streamlining thePentagon. But he does have a complex plan to overhaul theweapons-buying bureaucracy. And he hopes to achieve some $30 billionin total savings by the 1993 fiscal year.   Whether or not that is a realistic expectation is anybody's guess.   It is important that Congress cooperate, because defense budgetsare certain to decline in the years immediately ahead. The only wayto keep the nation's defense capabilities from declining as well asto spend more carefully.</TEXT><TEXT>   July 15   Chronicle-Tribune, Marion, Ind., on flag burning:   Monroe County Sheriff James Young says a U.S. Supreme Courtdecision isn't going to stop him from arresting people who burn theAmerican flag.   Young has told his deputies to continue arresting people whodeface the flag. He based his policy on two theories:   _That flag burning fits the definition of disorderly conductunder Indiana law.   _That desecrating an American flag violates the First Amendmentfreedom of expression of U.S. citizens who revere the flag as asymbol of their country.   Young believes he's on solid ground with the disorderly conductlaw because few public acts provoke a more violent response thandefacing an American flag. ...   Young also defends his policy on constitutional grounds, arguingthat the flag is a ``collective expression'' of public patriotismthat should be protected under the First Amendment. ...   Young may be stretching the point a bit too far. But the U.S.Supreme Court also has been known to do that occasionally.</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
