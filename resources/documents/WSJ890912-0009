The guilty pleas and check-signing capped a long-delayed process that was set in motion in January, when Drexel agreed to plead guilty and to pay $300 million in fines and penalties and another $350 million in civil restitution. The firm also agreed to allow a high level of control over its operations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    The government began investigating possible insider trading and securities fraud at Drexel in 1986, when former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky began providing information to the government. After repeatedly asserting its innocence and vowing to fight any charges, Drexel agreed to plead guilty to certain lesser offenses rather than face potentially crippling racketeering charges.    Yesterday afternoon, Drexel sent three checks totaling $300,196,770.97, which included interest that accrued since last January, to the U.S. Postal Service and federal marshals. Most of that money could be used to help finance the Bush administration's ambitious plan -- unveiled last week -- to fight the nation's drug war, according to Acting U.S. Attorney Benito Romano.    Checks totaling another $200 million were placed into an escrow fund to be used to settle the dozens of civil claims that have been filed against Drexel in recent years. Drexel will pay another $150 million into that fund over the next two years.    U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood accepted Drexel's guilty plea yesterday morning. The plea was made by Drexel outside counsel Thomas Curnin of Cahill Gordon andamp; Reindel. No Drexel official participated, and Chief Executive Officer Frederick Joseph wasn't in the courtroom.    The plea had been delayed in part by Drexel's lengthy negotiations to reach a separate pact with the SEC. The SEC agreement, which called for sweeping changes within Drexel, was approved in June.    Of the $300,196,770.97 in fines and restitution that Drexel paid, $78 million will be considered criminal penalties for Drexel's illegal gains from the crimes to which it pleaded guilty. Another $16 million of that money is the civil penalty Drexel must pay under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act.    The remainder will be deposited into a forfeiture fund supervised by the Department of Justice. Mr. Romano said yesterday that in the past the fund has been used largely to finance the construction of federal prisons. But beginning Oct. 1, the fund will be turned over to Secretary William Bennett, the nation's drug czar. Secretary Bennett, he said, will decide how the funds will be allocated.    In a news release issued yesterday, Drexel said that while its decision to plead guilty is &quot;a highly sobering event, we are determined to make Drexel a model of how a securities firm ought to conduct its business in the nineties and to focus energies and resources on the opportunities which lie ahead of us.&quot;    Drexel pleaded guilty to the following acts of wrongdoing, which the government alleges occurred between 1984 and 1986: fraud in the sale of securities of Fischbach Corp. between April 1984 and March 1985; mail fraud in connection with Golden Nugget Inc.'s sale of MCA Inc. common stock; fraud in the sale of securities of Phillips Petroleum Co.; fraud in the sale of securities of Harris Graphics Corp. common shares; fraud in the sale of securities of Stone Container Corp. common stock; mail fraud in connection with trading in securities of C.O.M.B. Co.    As part of its deal with the government, Drexel agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in their continuing investigation of Michael Milken, Drexel's former chief of junk bond operations. The government said that Mr. Milken was behind all of the crimes to which Drexel pleaded guilty. In March, Mr. Milken was indicted on 98 counts of securities and tax fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. He has repeatedly declared his innocence.    As soon as next month, prosecutors are expected to seek an expanded indictment against Mr. Milken. The government also is continuing to investigate certain present and former Drexel employees and clients.    Others who have been notified that they are likely to be indicted soon include Warren Trepp, Drexel's chief junk bond trader, Roy Johnson, a Drexel bond salesman, Peter Gardiner, a former Drexel trader and Allen Rosenthal, a former senior vice president in Drexel's junk bond department.    Individuals familiar with the investigation say that Mr. Trepp has been offered, and has declined, immunity in exchange for his grand jury testimony. Another Drexel salesman, David Sydorick, has accepted an immunity agreement from the U.S. attorney's office and is now negotiating a similar agreement with the SEC.    James Dahl, a Drexel salesman who was granted immunity last year, continued his report to prosecutors in Beverly Hills yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
