Political analysts were divided last night on whether the exchange would help Mr. Bush because he sparred with Mr. Rather so vigorously, or hurt him because he may have appeared too defensive and evasive. But in any event, the interview seems certain to be one of the most memorable moments of the 1988 campaign.    &quot;It was television history,&quot; said Michael Robinson, a Georgetown University professor specializing in press and politics. &quot;I don't think we've ever seen a fight like this on live TV between a high ranking government official and a news anchor.&quot;    Mr. Bush agreed to the interview on the condition that the network would carry his remarks live. He appeared after CBS aired a long story asserting that he hadn't answered many questions about his role in arms sales to Iran and his knowledge of arms shipments to Nicaragua's Contra rebels.    When the interview began on the network's regular evening broadcast, the vice president immediately attacked CBS and Mr. Rather, asserting that he had been lured into the interview under the false pretense that it would be part of a general political profile. Mr. Bush then charged that the CBS report &quot;impugned my integrity&quot; by suggesting that he had been told about secret arms shipments to the Contra rebels. He said the report represented nothing more than a &quot;rehash&quot; of questions already examined extensively.    At that point, Mr. Rather began asking questions, but Mr. Bush interrupted to dispute assertions made within the questions. Eventually, Mr. Rather asserted that Mr. Bush has been unwilling to give detailed answers. &quot;This is what leads people to say either, quote, George Bush was irrelevant or he was ineffective,&quot; the anchorman said.    The exchange became more acrimonious, with the two men often speaking at the same time. Mr. Rather asserted that Mr. Bush was told in a 1986 meeting with an Israeli official that the arms sales to Iran were in exchange for the release of American hostages. Mr. Bush replied that the Israeli official was talking about what the Israeli government -- not the U.S. -- was doing.    Mr. Rather then pressed the vice president on his assertion that he never heard Secretary of State George Shultz object strenuously to the arms sales to Iran, even though Mr. Bush apparently was at a meeting in which Mr. Shultz claims to have spoken out.    Mr. Bush said he never heard the objections, then said to Mr. Rather: &quot;It's not fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?&quot; That was a pointed reference to last Sept. 11 when Mr. Rather left the set in anger because a tennis match cut into his 22-minute newscast. The walkout left the network black in some markets for several minutes.    &quot;I think it hurt them both,&quot; political analyst Alan Baron said of the exchange. &quot;But Rather isn't running for anything.&quot;    Other political observers said the forum chosen by the vice president, CBS Inc.'s news program, was more favorable to Mr. Rather. &quot;It's the equivalent of going on the Tonight Show and criticizing Johnny Carson's lowest moments,&quot; said Democratic poll taker Peter Hart, who thinks the spat will hurt the vice president.    Others, however, thought the episode would redound to Mr. Bush's advantage both because he blasted the media and because Mr. Rather went too far in his questioning. The Bush campaign claimed that its offices around the country were immediately flooded with telephone calls supporting the vice president.    To bolster the vice president's assertion that CBS misrepresented the purpose of the interview, the Bush campaign released a letter the network sent Mr. Bush Jan. 5 requesting the interview. The letter, from Richard M. Cohen, senior political producer, said the network was doing &quot;a series of candidate profiles.&quot; It doesn't mention the Iran-Contra affair.    But CBS denied that it had misled Mr. Bush. Mr. Cohen said that while CBS initially asked Mr. Bush for an interview for a profile, it subsequently decided to focus on Mr. Bush's role in the Iran-Contra affair. &quot;Then we informed them (the Bush campaign) that the interview would be substantive, issue-oriented and tough, and those were the exact words we used,&quot; Mr. Cohen said. And, he added, the network widely advertised that the interview would deal with the Iran-Contra issue.    Indeed, in New York, the nation's largest media market, and on the West Coast, where the newscast is aired on tape, CBS News could have edited out the interview but chose not to. &quot;There was no reason for us not to run it in its entirety,&quot; a CBS News spokesman said. Moreover, Mr. Rather appeared as usual on the network's broadcast of President Reagan's State of the Union address later last night. i2   ---   Dennis Kneale in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
