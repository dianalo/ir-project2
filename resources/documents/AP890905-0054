Also today, Israel media said the government has begun usinghelicopters to track down wanted Palestinians in remote villages andmountain hideouts in the occupied West Bank.   In a letter this week to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, PresidentBush turned down an Israeli request for aid to rehabilitate refugeecamps in the occupied territories, said Shamir spokesman YossiAhimeir.   He said the United States, Japan, Canada and European nations allrejected the request and said any additional refugee assistancedepends on further progress in stalemated peace efforts.   Bush's letter came in response to Shamir's request about twomonths ago for the United States to take a leading role in aidingrehabilitation of the camps, Ahimeir said.   ``We consider the refugee problem to be a very important humanproblem,'' Ahimier said on Israel radio. ``Resolving it could helpadvance the entire peace initiative.''   The issue arose as Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanayahu ofShamir's right-wing Likud bloc headed to Washington to drum up moreAmerican help for peace efforts and to argue against PLO chiefYasser Arafat receiving a U.S. visa to address the United Nations.   Netanyahu blamed the Palestinians for holding up the peaceprocess, saying slayings of 107 residents in the territories byfellow Arabs were aimed at blocking agreement to Israel's peaceintiative. Most of those killed were accused of collaborating withIsraeli authorities.   Maariv quoted Bush as saying in his letter to Shamir that therefugee camps had to be part of a ``comprehensive plan to resolvethe conflict'' between Israel and Arab states.   Bush also reportedly reminded Shamir that the United Statesalready plays a prominent role in aiding the refugees bycontributing to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which administersthe refugee camps.   The United States is the U.N. agency's top contributor, anddonated more than $60 million of its $223 million budget his year,agency officials said. According to the agency, 844,708 Palestinianrefugees live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Resolving the refugee problem is part of Israel's four-pointpeace plan. The ramshackle camps in the West Bank and Gaza Striphave been key trouble spots since Israel occupied these lands duringthe 1967 Middle East War.   The camps also have been at the center of the 20-month uprisingagainst the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The centralpoint of Israel peace initiative is elections in the occupiedterritories to chose Palestinian representatives to negotiate withIsrael on interim autonomy for the territories, with their finalstatus to be settled later.   After criticism of the elections proposal by the PLO and otherPalestinians, Israeli officials called for a worldwide program toimprove conditions in the camps.   Also today, Israel radio said the army is using helicopters totrack down wanted Palestinians in remote villages and mountainhideouts in the occupied West Bank.   An army spokesman said the military has used helicopters forspecific missions in the occupied territories but refused to verifythe use of the choppers was part of a new policy for arrestingleaders of the Palestinian uprising.   In the Gaza Strip, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy died of woundssuffered in a earlier clash with soldiers, Arab reports said. Theboy, Ahmed al-Abed el-Bittar from the town of Khan Yunis, died of ahead wound sustained in a clash with troops last week, the reportssaid.   His death raises to 558 the Palestinian death toll in the morethan 20-month uprising against Israeli occupation. Thirty-nineIsraelis have also died in the violence.   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, masked Palestinian youthsstabbed to death Naeem Fakhri Afana, 27, Arab reports said. Theysaid Afana was suspected of collaborating with Israel.   The army confirmed both deaths and said in Rafah one other Arabwas severely beaten.</TEXT></DOC>
