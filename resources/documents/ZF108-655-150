 In this section of our Drupa report, we will provide an update on thenew developments that were shown in Dusseldorf.andM;In addition to the items included here, we call attention to some of thevendors that appeared in the composition section in the first part of ourDrupa report.andP;  Among these exhibitors, which displayed products of generalinterest that also support non-Roman languages, were Abacus, Amicus andDiwan.andP;  We covered Abacus's PC-based editorial and pagination system, but wedidn't show samples of the newspapers it is putting out using Indian scripts.andM;Agfa demonstrated the Apple LaserWriter II NTX-J supporting Kanji andEnglish, plus the Arabic version of Letraset's ReadSetGo, but these weren'tnew.andM;Atex enters Arabic market with 3000andM;In part one of our Drupa report, we discussed progress on Atex's PC-based3000 system developed in the UK in conjunction with APt Systems.andP;  Besides thepagination and graphics developments (integration of Chelgraph's graphicssystem) that were demonstrated as part of the overall product offering, Atexunveiled a system for composing and outputting Arabic.andM;It is a bit of a shock to see XyWrite working from right to left, with Arabiccharacters on the screen.andP;  (The system supports mixing Arabic and Romancharacters.)andM;Atex claims that the quality of Arabic composition it produces is unsurpassedin the marketplace.andP;  We find it so difficult to evaluate such claims inEnglish that we wouldn't even think about trying to do so regarding Arabic.andO;But Atex has included one feature that is particularly notable: bothautomatic and manual insertion of kashedas for justification.andP;  (As most ofour readers probably know, kashedas are the horizontal extensions of Arabicwords to justify text lines.andP;  Good Arabic typesetting has uniform wordspaces,with kashedas providing the necessary &quot;stretch.&quot;)andM;Atex's development has taken about two years, during which it consultednewspapers in the Middle East.andP;  Automatic kasheda insertion is based onlookup tables that evaluate character pairs to determine where insertion islegal (which most programs do) and it also views whole words to try toachieve aesthetic consistency.andM;The interesting aspect of the program, though, is the manual function.andO;Kashedas of any length can be &quot;drawn&quot; manually on the screen as desired.andO;This makes it possible to tailor the output to the user's (or the scribe's)satisfaction.andP;  We've heard Arabic scholars complain over the years thatcomputer programs can't duplicate closely enough the results a scribe wouldproduce, particularly in headlines, where &quot;customizing&quot; is common.andP;  PerhapsAtex's approach will mollify those users, even if the average typesetterwon't bother to use the manual facility.andM;Linotype exhibits broad lineupandM;Linotype, a grandfather in the multilanguage typesetting market, used a largeportion of its space to demonstrate support for non-Roman scripts: Arabic,Hebrew, Thai, Devanagari, Gujarati, Malayalam and Tamil, all of which arecurrently being used in the field.andP;  Soon to be released are Bengali, Teluguand Kannada.andM;Among the products demonstrated were the Abacus PC pagination system withEnglish and Indian scripts, Diwan's wire service capabilities for Arabic andEnglish, and ReadySetGo running Thai and Devanagari.andP;  It was the first timewe had seen the Thai implementation.andM;Arabic Series 1000.andP;  Continuing a 75-year commitment to Arabic typesetting,Linotype demonstrated the Series 1000 for Arabic.andP;  As with the company'sother Series 1000 products, this one is based on the Macintosh and uses avariety of third-party software for many functions, nicely integrated withLinotype typefaces and output devices.andP;  It runs the gamut from text entry tocomposition to image processing to wire service to page makeup, supportingArabic and either English or French in the same files.andM;Third-party products used in the system include Adobe's Illustrator 88,Diwan's NewsNet and PictureNet systems (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  19), andLetraset's ReadySetGo and DesignStudio.andP;  They are tied together usingLocalTalk or Ethernet networks and AppleShare or Tops software.andM;Linotype has been expanding its Arabic typeface library, which now totals 13different designs and 23 faces counting light, bold and outline versions ofthe same designs.andP;  In the display set are Al Harf Al Jadid (regular andoutline), Mofid Mahdi, Qadi, Ahmed (regular and outline), and Kufi (regularand outline), the first five of which are available in PostScript format.andM;Text faces are Ruq'ah, Badr (light and bold), Jalal (light and bold), ASVCodar (light and bold), Nazanin (light and bold), Lotus (light and bold),Yakout (light and bold) and Mitra (light and bold), the last four pairs ofwhich are offered in PostScript format.andM;Linotype is attempting to move its traditional-quality faces to PostScript asfast as possible.andP;  PostScript faces use a hinting scheme that works the sameway that hinting is accomplished for Roman scripts, which makes themgenerally suitable for output at high or low resolution.andP;  There is onecomplicating factor, though, that is worth mentioning here.andP;  One of theArabic characters, called the alef, is a nearly vertical stroke that issubject to jaggies (stair-stepping) when output at low resoltuion, even withhinted fonts.andP;  Diwan's approach with its systems is to output the alef as aperfectly vertical stroke at low resolution and with its traditional slope athigh resolution.andP;  Linotype, on the other hand, preserves the true design atall resolutions, but suffers from the jaggies at low resolution.andM;Linotype reported that 11 Middle Eastern publishers have bought Series 1000to produce 16 newspapers.andM;Linotype also has an Arabic version of its LinoSetting systems, which runs ona Macintosh and supports the CRTronic input command language, with addedfacilities for handling graphics and advanced PostScript capabilities.andM;Japanese.andP;  Linotype showed the Linotronic 200PJ and the RIP3J with the L300Japanese typesetters, focusing on PostScript, but not the traditional Coramachines.andP;  Initial shipments took place last December.andP;  Sales are through sixdistributors, five of which handle only the PostScript machine.andP;  They includeLinotype's long-time partner Morisawa, a division of Mitsubishi, a localdistributor of Claris and Quark software, and design-oriented firms in Tokyoand Osaka.andM;Linotype still runs joint ventures with Morisawa, which currently involvemanufacturing of typesetters and development of Kanji fonts.andP;  Two fonts areavailable and three more are coming.andM;Thai.andP;  Linotype introduced a Thai version of ReadySetGo, developed byLinotype in conjunction with Letraset.andP;  It employs the same logic that wasdeveloped for the Linotron 202 in 1982 and is in use in a dozen or soinstallations in Thailand.andP;  As readers may be aware, the most difficultaspect of composing text in Thai is that it uses no space between words,although it does insert spaces at the ends of sentences, around numbers andin a few other places.andP;  So finding appropriate line breaks is a challenge.andM;Initial computer programs many years ago required the operator to type a worddelimiter after each word to tell the program where it could break a line.andO;Not surprisingly, this practice didn't go over well with typists who wereused to typing words without anything between them.andM;Linotype's program uses word-breaking logic with an operator's option ofinserting forced or discretionary breaks where desired.andP;  It also employsletterspacing.andM;The success of such a program depends on the sophistication of thelogic--provided the user doesn't want to be shackled with the responsibilityof fixing all the computer's mistakes.andP;  We didn't have a chance to study theresults, but on one newspaper page we looked at, we did notice that wherespaces were inserted (such as between sentences), they tended to be huge,which suggests that the logic isn't finding enough valid break points.andO;Linotype said that improvements are being worked on, including a facility forconsulting a list of exception words and enhancements to the logic program.andM;In case you wondered how the word processor handles selecting words whenthere is no space to delimit them, the answer is that double-clicking on acharacter selects the entire sentence or line.andM;The Thai ReadySetGo supports English and Thai, which both read from left toright, in the same stories.andP;  To find out which language is currently active,there is an indicator: the flag of the country in which the language isspoken.andP;  Fonts available include Sirichana light and bold.andP;  Three weights ofThongterm and two of Sukhothai will be available later this year.andM;India.andP;  Besides the Abacus pagination system for newspapers and Yellow Pages(see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  19), Linotype showed its Indian versions of ReadySetGo,which have been developed further since we last saw them.andP;  On display wasDevanagari, the script used in Hindi and other languages.andP;  Also beingdeveloped and scheduled for release soon are Gujarati, Malayalam and Tamil.andO;Planned for August release are Kannada, Telugu and Bengali.andM;For generating conjunct characters in these languages, Linotype useskeyboarding conventions similar to those we described in our discussion ofSolustan's Macintosh desk accessory at the March Seybold Seminars.andP;  TheLinotype system requires the operator to strike the CONJUNCT key once if thenext two characters are to be formed into one conjunct character or twice ifthe next three are to be joined.andM;Linotype says that some of these scripts require as many as 2,000 differentconjunct characters.andP;  Font character sets vary from language to language, butthey generally require the use of two fonts because they comprise about 350characters.andM;Linotype has three distributors for its PostScript machines in India,including one in Delhi and two in Bombay (Abacus and Linotype Associates).andM;Glyph font utility adds Arabic, HebrewandM;Glyph, an American company founded last November to develop software forinternational markets, showed its multilingual font-generation andfont-management programs.andP;  It has licensed the entire Compugraphic typelibrary, including the Arabic fonts, and uses CG's Intellifont routine torender them on the screen of PCS and on output devices.andM;The program, called Typographer, accommodates both Roman and non-Roman fonts,scaling outlines to generate sizes from 4-point to 200-point in half-pointincrements.andP;  It is menu driven and has built-in help functions.andP;  It runs witha range of applications including Ventura Publisher, Page-Maker, WordPerfect,Microsoft Word and XyWrite.andP;  Version 2 of the program, demonstrated at Drupa,adds support for the LaserJet III and additional screen displays andapplications.andM;The Typographer, a joint development between Glyph and Agfa, is available andinstalled in Australia, Cyprus (Glyph's base for international support) andthe Middle East.andP;  It costs $549 with CG Times, CG Times Italic, CG Times Boldand two additional fonts, depending on the country.andP;  Additional outlinetypefaces are available for $60 each.andM;Arabic, Hebrew for Ventura.andP;  Glyph also announced its Arabic Publisher andHebrew Publisher to run with Ventura.andP;  Arabic Publisher uses a standard IBMPC running any standard version of Dos with which Ventura Publisher runs.andO;Menus and icons appear in English and are the same as in the English version.andO;The reason for this, Glyph says, is that it would be difficult to translatesome of the concepts into Arabic and have them fit within the space availableon a menu.andP;  This approach should work fine for people who read some English,but it must be difficult for people who don't read any English.andM;Text, of course, appears in Arabic.andP;  Glyph applies automatic contextualanalysis at keystroke to access the correct characters, which are displayedin WYSIWYG format on the screen as they are keyed.andP;  Using the Typographer'sability to generate floating accents for European languages, Glyph rendersArabic diacritical marks (vowels and other distinguishing signs) above andbelow the text line.andP;  The system currently is limited to two positions abovethe text and two below it, which isn't sufficient for quality work, but thislimit is expected to be removed when the product is released.andP;  This will beparticularly important in children's and religious literature, which requiremuch greater use of accents than do newspapers and similar applications.andM;Another limitation is that two diacritics can't be placed close together,such as the &quot;A&quot; vowel (fattah) sitting over the shaddah (which lengthens aconsonant sound).andP;  Similarly, the combination of a vowel and a hamzah (whichindicates a glottal stop to start a syllable) occurs frequently, but it isn'tyet possible on the Glyph system.andM;One other problem related to placement of diacritics occurs when marks placedbelow one line clash with marks placed above text on the next line.andP;  The onlyway Glyph can deal with these conflicts is to increase interline spacing.andP;  Itcan't move them slightly to avoid having them touch.andP;  (We have heard ofsystems that supposedly support thousands of different positions fordiacritics to avoid these problems, but we have never asked to see more thana few of them demonstrated.)andP;  Glyph says it will correct this problem in theversion of the software that is released.andM;Arabic Publisher also can mix Roman and Arabic text, although Englishhyphenation hasn't been implemented yet.andP;  Roman text is inserted inleft-to-right sequence, while the line of Arabic text continues to run rightto left (i.e., the cursor stays to the left of the English text, not to theright of it, as is the case when text is entered from left to right).andM;Kashedas are inserted automatically both while text is entered and duringjustification.andP;  Checks prevent the use of kashedas in certain charactercombinations, such as the so-called nonconnectors (d, dh, w, r, z), which canbe attached only to a preceding character.andM;Regarding kashedas, it is useful to bear in mind that Arabic is a scriptedlanguage (the writing uses a script, cursive-like style) and therefore ismuch more closely related to the language's orthographic system than is thecase with languages where the printed version has devolved so far from thescripted hand-written language as to exist as a separate system.andP;  PrintedArabic still is relatively close to its handwritten equivalent, so aestheticjudgment regarding its vagaries and nuances is tricky.andP;  In the case ofkasheda lengthening to aid in justifying lines, any violation of theaesthetics of the compositor or the reader is greatly frowned on.andO;Unfortunately, trying to put into formal rules the aesthetic values that havebeen handed down through the ages is extremely difficult.andM;A few ligatures and logos are supported, but not nearly the 300 or sorequired for Gulf Arabic (the exact number depends on whom you talk to).andO;These can be turned on to make the program look constantly at characterclusters for possible logos and ligatures without significant degrading speedof typing.andP;  If logos and ligatures are not required, this function can beturned off.andP;  Twenty logos and ligatures are currently supported in the basefont, although for the final product a conclusive decision hasn't been madeyet.andP;  Glyph currently offers 11 typefaces for the various Arabic languages,including Farsi.andP;  If the Typographer product is used in conjunction withArabic Publisher, a much wider range of faces is available.andM;The Hebrew product is essentially the same as the Arabic versions, supportingright-to-left text entry and display, mixing Hebrew and Roman text within ajob, and positioning of accent markers in multiple locations.andP;  The limitationof two accents above the text line and two below it isn't a problem in Hebrewbecause the language doesn't need more.andM;Filters for the most popular Hebrew word processors have been developed.andP;  Theproduct is expected to be released in June.andM;Output for both the Arabic and Hebrew packages is to a Laseret II, althoughthe released version will support the LaserJet III with Intellifonts.andP;  Glyphexpects to support PostScript soon, but it hasn't completed the driver.andM;Glyph is positioning these products as desktop publishing solutions,although, Glyph says, Agfa Compugraphic is positioning them higher in themarket.andP;  Pricing hasn't been determined, but the official launch will be inthe summer, with Polydiam handling it in Europe.andP;  Glyph is actively seekingother representation in various countries.andM;Morisawa shows Kanji systemandM;Morisawa andamp; Company, of Japan, demonstrated the MK-300 workstation based on akeyboard and the new MK-300P version that uses a digitizing pad.andP;  For anyonewho hasn't seen Japanese input systems before, these units are a sight tobehold.andP;  The main keypad on the 300 contains 480 keys, most of which havenine levels, accessing more than 4,000 characters.andP;  In addition, foursupplementary rows of key labels can access some 900 additional characters.andO;Then there are 59 keys on four small pads, used in various way to bring thetotal of available characters near the 8,000 mark; from a total of 647 keys.andM;The MK-300's keyboard supports Kanji (ideographic) characters as well as 50hiragana and 50 katakana syllabaries (used to build foreign words oradditional Kanji characters).andM;The 300P is even more complex, supporting a main pad area to pick characterswith a four-button puck, plus supplementary pads around the edges.andP;  It isintended for production of catalogs and business forms.andM;The MK workstations use a 17&quot;, high-resolution monitor that displayscharacters in WYSIWYG form.andP;  Fonts are stored in outline format andrasterized on the fly for screen display edited in a non-WYSIWYG environment.andM;These workstations support display in left-to-right orientation forhorizontal text and right-to-left sequence for text arranged vertically.andO;That is, text that reads from top to bottom proceeds from right to left aseach line is completed.andP;  Text that reads horizontally across a line goes fromleft to right.andM;For composing forms, the software includes commands for automatic generationof equidistant rules, grabbing and stretching elements, drawing rules betweentwo marked points, and horizontal and vertical alignment of text blocks.andO;Commands can be edited on the command line.andM;Output devices supported are a 486-dpi Panasonic laser printer for A3-sizeplain paper, the Linotronic 300E and 500E for high resolution on photographicmaterial, and the Morisawa FP film recorder.andP;  The Linotron 202E is no longeravailable in Japan.andM;Morisawa puts together several system configurations using the MK-300workstations, a PC workstation (which supports Ventura Publisher in English),a RIP using a 68030 processor, and a choice of output devices.andP;  They are soldin Japan and other Asian countries that require Japanese, Chinese or Koreantext composition.andM;Software programs available include Ebessan for making up text pages,Bentensan for tables and rules using a mouse, The Equal for math composition,and Copymm for conversion of files between MS-DOS and Morisawa format.andM;Morisawa said its RIP can rasterize 1,000 Kanji characters in one minute.andM;We were told that 150 300P workstations have been sold since its introductionin the middle of last year and that about 1,000 Cora-based Kanji typesettershave been sold in the last two years.andM;PostScript.andP;  Morisawa has an agreement with Adobe under which it isdeveloping fonts that Adobe will license to its OEM customers.andP;  The first twoare Ryumin Light (Mincho), designed by Morisawa, and Medium Gothic.andP;  Threemore PostScript faces under development are Futomin (Bold Mincho), FutogoB101 (Bold Gothic) and un 101 (Round Gothic).andP;  Each font has about 7,000characters.andM;Morisawa said that those five faces should be enough for most business users,but that the newspaper market requires 10 or 12.andP;  For catalogs and brochures,the target is to have about 30 fonts available.andM;Morisawa demonstrated a Kanji version of the QMS ColorScript 100, which willbe available soon.andM;Solustan adds Russian, fontsandM;We became acquainted with Solustan at the Seybold Seminars in March, where itdemonstrated a nice facility for using Indian scripts as desk accessories ona Macintosh and for composition within Ventura Publisher on a PC.andP;  At Drupa,it demonstrated those products plus two new ones.andP;  One of these is a Russianword processing and desktop publishing package on a PC and Mac, using theCircle Noetic hyphenation product announced in Boston.andM;Russian is relatively simple in comparison to the work Solustan has alreadydone with Indic scripts.andP;  The Russian language has only two special accents,which are required for textbooks, and no conjunct characters.andP;  The Cyrillickeyboard follows the Russian typewriter standard, with two shift levels.andP;  Aphonetic keyboard layout is available optionally.andM;The software is memory resident on a '286 AT.andP;  Russian and English can bemixed by selecting alternate languages from the keyboard and particular fontsfrom menus.andM;Solustan also markets the Casady andamp; Greene Fluent Laser Font product, withType 1 and Type 3 versioins bundled with the system.andP;  Solustan is matchingthe Casady andamp; Greene font codes with its own implementation of Ventura.andM;Solustan now offers hyphenation in 16 different languages, covering words ofat least four, five or six characters, depending on the hyphenation routineloaded by the user into Ventura.andP;  These modules have been developed inconjunction with Ventura, although Xerox is not selling them.andP;  Because thesoftware is memory resident, the modules on a PC work only within Ventura.andO;On a Macintosh, they can be used with any software because they serve as deskaccessories.andP;  On a Mac, though, there is a danger of losing formattinginformation because the hyphenation is essentially done on the clipboard:text is taken out, handamp;j'ed and put back, so if the user isn't careful toselect the hidden information at the beginning of a file (instead of startingwith the first visible character), formatting information could be lost.andM;The product is sold in single-language units.andP;  Output is PostScript on boththe PC and the Macintosh, but Solustan will provide LaserJet II and IIIoutput soon.andP;  Currently only Type 3 fonts are supported, but Solustan is inthe process of preparing Type 1 fonts hinted using Fontographer.andP;  Completionis imminent.andP;  Also under way is support for Adobe Type Manager, which willallow better rendering of screen fonts on a Macintosh.andM;The Devanagari system hasn't changed since the Seminars, but Solustan isaiming for LaserJet II and III output soon.andP;  It needs to provide the fonts inIntellifont format and to get a LaserJet driver from Xerox to complete thisproject.andP;  So far, Xerox has been responsive to Solustan's efforts, so noproblems are anticipated.andM;Solustan's products are distributed by Polydiam in the UK and Europe.andM;Image Ltd. develops Greek systemandM;One company that didn't exhibit but that did bring samples of its output wasImage Ltd., of Athens, Greece.andP;  It has developed Greek fonts and ahyphenation program for systems running on PCs on Novell networks.andP;  Aneight-PC pilot system has been installed at a newspaper with a dailycirculation of 30,000.andP;  A three-PC network is in use at a magazine site.andM;We haven't seen the system, but the developer says it supports editorialworkstations for writers and editors, job tracking and pagination usingVentura Publisher or another package.andM;Fonts are in PostScript Type 3 format using Nimbus hints.andM;Testing will continue until August, we were told, with regular sales to startthen.andM;Although Interleaf obviously cannot promise to keep the offer open forever,the company expects that this will be a long-term proposition.andP;  The move isdesigned to &quot;seed the market&quot; with young programmers who grow to likeInterleaf software.andP;  David Weinberger, an Interleaf spokesman, expressedInterleaf's confidence: &quot;We don't think they'll ever go back after they useInterleaf.&quot;andM;Slim TPS.andP;  The latest announcement is &quot;Slim TPS Basics,&quot; a new version of TPS4.0 for Sun stations.andP;  So named because it takes less hard disk space, SlimTPS relies on PostScript fonts for output and Flexifonts for screen display,omitting the Bitstream fonts Interleaf usually offers with TPS.andM;Slim TPS Basics is targeted at first-time publishing buyers in theengineering market.andP;  It is installed by the user; it includes an easier menusystem and has a new &quot;instant expert&quot; tutorial; and its functionality,slightly less than that of Core TPS, includes the equation option of CoreTPS.andP;  The clincher is a promotion in which Slim TPS Basics will be $795 untilSeptember 30.andP;  To encourage buyers, Interleaf is also offering a free trialversion of Slim TPS (it doesn't save files).andM;Following the expiration of the promotional period, Slim TPS will be pricedat $2,250.andP;  For those wondering how it compares with Core TPS, Slim Basicsdoes not include the book facility, automatic indexing and list generation,pair kerning, raster editing of line art and the ability to set irregularrun-arounds--all features in Core TPS.andP;  Slim TPS Basics may be upgraded toinclude these and other options.andP;  It runs under SunView and is preconfiguredfor upgrading to a network site license.andM;HP promotion in Europe.andP;  The free trials are not limited to Slim TPS,however.andP;  In Europe, Hewlett-Packard is currently offering its Unixworkstation users a three-month Interleaf software license free of charge.andO;If they elect to purchase the software during the period, the price isdiscounted by 42%.andM;The numbers: silver lining?andP;  Interleaf posted a modest profit of $149,000($.01/share) on $22.8 million in sales in its last quarter, ended April 30.andO;This compares with earnings of $549,000 ($.05/share) on sales of $26 millionin the same quarter last year.andP;  For the year, Interleaf suffered losses of$16 million on $88.8 million in sales--primarily because of write-offs lastquarter, when Interleaf left the turnkey system business.andM;Interleaf is still on the rocky road of transition from turnkey systemsupplier to software house and system integrator, but its software sales inthe last six months have remained strong.andP;  Company president Bob Weiler saidthat Interleaf has made up in software revenues all of the revenue lost dueto terminating hardware sales.andM;WEiler predicted that Interleaf will break even for the first half of theyear and begin to show its profitable turn-around in the second half.andM;New managers.andP;  As might be expected of a new president, Weiler has brought innew executives to help him complete Interleaf's transition.andP;  One new slot wasthe filling of the vacancy left by the sudden departure of George Potter,co-founder and chief sales executive since the company's inception.andP;  Potterleft in January, shortly after Weiler arrived.andP;  He remains on the board butis no longer actively involved with Interleaf.andM;Potter's replacement is Mark Ruport, who has just joined the company assenior vice president of world sales.andP;  Ruport was most recently vicepresident of sales for Informix and previously worked in sales and operationsat Cullinet and Applied Data Research.andM;Reporting to Ruport are Ed Mallen, VP of U.S.andP;  sales; Steve Cummings, VP ofinternational sales; Steve Cummings, Meyer, head of system integration.andM;Formed last year, the system integration group currently accounts for nearlya quarter of Interleaf's sales.andP;  Weiler said he expects that percentage toincrease to 35% to 40% in the next few years.andM;Moving to Waltham.andP;  In the midst of the other events, Interleaf announcedthat it will soon move its headquarters from Cambridge to an office park inWaltham, a suburb west of Boston.andP;  The move is perceived as both a financialand aesthetic improvement by most people with whom we talked.andP;  The rents andtaxes in Cambridge are among the highest in the Boston area.andP;  The annualsavings could be several million dollars.andM;Less tangible, but also attractive, will be the benefits of suburban living.andO;Located just west of Boston along the Route 128 beltway, Waltham is much moreeasily reached by employees and customers, and the new building has on-siteparking, a long-standing problem at the current building.andM;The upcoming move will consolidate three Interleaf facilities--two inCambridge and one in Wilmington--and reflects the company's need to scaleback the size of its operations.andM;What's ahead?andP;  Interleaf has been synonymous with the icon-based desktop ofTPS, but there are indications that its image may change.andP;  Interleaf recentlyannounced that it was developing an Open Look versions of TPS.andP;  No timetablewas revealed, but Weiler hinted that the move was part of a much largereffort within Interleaf to &quot;pry the interface from the product'sfunctionality&quot;--shades of a similar move by Frame last year.andP;  Weilerindicated that Interleaf's goal is to offer its customers a choice of userinterfaces, with TPS fully conforming to the standard interfaces of thecomputer market.andM;Such a move is in step with Interleaf's transition from turnkey system tosoftware that interacts with other applications on a computer desktop.andP;  Itsusers once demanded consistency within the Interleaf application acrossplatforms; now the market is saying it wants consistency among applicationson the same platform.andP;  No matter which way you turn, it looks like a minefield.andP;  But Interleaf is confident.andP;  Aside from the hit it took last fall, sofar it has moved ahead unscathed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
