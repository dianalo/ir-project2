P. Krans, president of Royal Dutch/Shell operations inIndonesia. &quot;It requires a lot of tact and patience to getaround problems.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The big Anglo-Dutch company has a mixed track record inthis country, where its roots are deep. Still, says Mr.Krans, &quot;it's a good business environment at the moment.&quot;   Good -- but risky, he might have added. And almostimpossible to generalize about.   For Indonesia is a country of 182 million people spreadover a 3,000-mile-long archipelago, with thousands ofislands, disparate cultures and enormous natural resources.It is a nation whose economy and politics are closelyintertwined.   Until recent years, few multinational companies other thanoil concerns knew about Indonesia. Then in the late 1980s,the nation suddenly entered the limelight, and a range offoreign investors started looking at it. Their interest wassparked mainly by a government reform program to deregulate apreviously shackled economy. Indonesia opened the way forprivate companies to help tap its abundant resources.   The economy grew by more than 7% a year in 1989 and 1990.This year growth will be lower but still above 5%, followingmoves by authorities last year to begin squeezing credit outof the banking system to keep the economy from overheating.Interest rates soared, and many Indonesian companies wereleft starving for cash.   Investors are privately concerned about whether Indonesiawill remain politically stable. Power is concentrated in thehands of President Suharto, but a growing number ofIndonesians are seeking a more open society. There is alsoincreasing but muted criticism of the business activities ofhis children, who, executives feel, get preferentialtreatment. (Four of the six have entered a variety ofventures.)   The complexities of doing business in Indonesia can beseen by examining some of the companies that have attemptedto make significant investments. Here are the stories of foursuch concerns-two American, one Anglo-Dutch and oneJapanesethat have met with varying degrees of success.                                                                                                          ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL                                                                                                          In the late 19th century, this company began exploring foroil in Indonesia when it was still the Dutch East Indies.Since then, it has had both successes and failures. Today,the company would like to invest billions of dollars inIndonesia, although one major project has been stymied.   The company enjoyed a pleasant existence here in the olddays, growing nicely until a serious dispute betweenIndonesia and its former colonial master in the early 1960s.As a result, nearly all of Shell's operation was nationalizedor forced to close.   But in the past decade, Shell units have again becomeactive in Indonesia. They are involved in oil exploration,mining, forestry and other areas. In 1988 a unit of RoyalDutch/Shell received approval from the Indonesian governmentfor a $1.7 billion petrochemical complex to produce olefins,oil-based derivatives used in making plastics.   Although Shell had already renewed its presence inIndonesia, the large petrochemical project was considered themultinational concern's way of saying it was back in itsbirthplace in a big way.   However, unexpected snags appeared. As many recentinvestors had done, Shell and two Japanese partners took on acorporate group controlled by one of President Suharto's sons-- in this case, as a 5% shareholder. But rather than smooththe way, this move seemed to complicate matters as the group-- PT Bimantara Citra -- later demanded a larger equityshare.   Negotiations with Shell dragged on for months. The issuewas eventually resolved, with the group getting a 12% shareat the start and the promise of a bigger long-term stake. Butwhile Shell was losing time, other hurdles cropped up. Asecond, competing proposal by domestic investors for anolefins complex was approved by the government. The state oilcompany, Pertamina, said it would give priority for supplyingneeded naphtha feedstock to the competing project. Thepolitics of petrochemicals became further complicated when anexecutive of Bimantara Citra emerged at the same time as adirector of the competing project.   Nearly two years after Shell had hoped to break ground,there's still no sign it can go ahead. Meanwhile, thecompeting project appears stymied by a lack of financing,something Shell had already lined up.   Despite the discouragement and difficulties, Shell hasn'tgiven up on that project -- or on Indonesia. Mr. Krans, thecompany official, says that &quot;it's quite impressive what thegovernment has achieved over the last five to 10 years inderegulating the economy and attracting investment.&quot;                                                                                                          SCOTT PAPER CO.                                                                                                          In 1988 Scott Paper Co. received a government license fora $654 million tree plantation and pulp mill in Irian Jaya,Indonesia's largest province. Scott had a strong localpartner in PT Astra International.   But in late 1989, having prepared to plant a small trialeucalyptus plantation, Scott announced in Philadelphia thatit was withdrawing from the project after &quot;re-evaluating&quot; thecompany's future world-wide fiber needs. Indonesian officialsand businessmen were baffled by Scott's withdrawal so soonafter it began to set up.   Some believe Scott threw in the towel because of pressureby environmental groups in the U.S. Newspaper advertisementsthere accused Scott of planning to destroy a large tract oftropical rain forest -- even though the project area isn'train forest -- and disrupt tribal life. Some groups talked ofa consumer boycott of Scott tissues. The attacks on thecompany showed no sign of abating despite its efforts to workwith local environmentalists and tribesmen.   Other people say that following preliminary work, Scottdid further studies and decided that the cost was too high todo business in rugged Irian Jaya.   Scott has never shed more light on its departure, sayingonly that the kind of eucalyptus pulp it planned to harvest&quot;no longer plays the leading role we once thought it did&quot; inthe company's plans. A Scott executive in Jakarta describedas &quot;garbage&quot; the theory that environmentalists forced theU.S. company out. Astra is trying to carry on with theproject together with an Indonesian state forestry company,though its prospects without Scott are uncertain.   In any event, the net result for Scott was much time andplanning that ultimately went for nothing.                                                                                                          FREEPORT-MCMORAN                                                                                                          One of the oldest American investors in Indonesia,Freeport-McMoRan Copper andamp; Gold Co., arrived shortly afterGen. Suharto assumed power in the mid-1960s. And despite somedifficult times, the company -- a subsidiary ofFreeport-McMoRan Inc. -- has literally struck it rich inIndonesia.   Freeport Copper andamp; Gold's subsidiary, Freeport IndonesiaInc., will be kept busy for decades working in what ViceChairman Louis Clinton says might prove &quot;the greatest mineraldistrict in the world.&quot; Freeport has found vast reserves ofcopper, gold and silver in mountains in Irian Jaya,Indonesia's least-developed province.   Freeport won favorable terms from a government desperateto get investment. But the company spent heavily to build aroad through inhospitable swamps, jungles and mountains toreach the remote copper lode that others had located decadesearlier but doubted could be tapped.   Eventually, Freeport completed its engineering marvel,which included the world's longest single-span tramway (abouta mile) to move ore and miners. But for many years, becauseof poor mineral prices, the mine was barely paying foritself. In the late 1980s, Freeport was thinking of shuttingdown when it discovered a new, much larger mineral mountainnearby. Freeport says the new find, Grasberg, contains thesingle largest known gold reserves in the world. (The companyputs the gold reserve now at 22 million ounces, compared withone million ounces in 1986.)   &quot;We were struggling,&quot; says Mr. Clinton. Now, he adds,&quot;we've got a great longterm horizon. We're betting the ranchon Indonesia.&quot;   In addition to weak prices and a remote location, Freeporthas had to deal with occasional trouble with local tribesmenunhappy with it and the Indonesian government. The tribesmenwere apparently sympathetic to a small rebel movement tryingto end Jakarta's rule and make Irian Jaya independent. Theycut the company's pipeline for moving copper concentrate in1977 and again in 1986.   Although there's been no trouble in recent years, Freeportnow has other concerns. For one thing, environmentalists inIndonesia and the U.S. have charged it with damaging theprovince. The company is also under pressure to hire morelocal Irianese, a difficult task since most lack the skillsfor industrial jobs.   Freeport has increased spending on an environmentaltesting program and on jobtraining programs for Irianese.With the discovery of the huge new reserves, Freeport isassured of a solid cash flow to support these efforts, whichthe company acknowledges it neglected before.   &quot;We have a lot of faith in Indonesia,&quot; Mr. Clinton says.&quot;It has earned that.&quot;                                                                                                          TEIJIN                                                                                                          Teijin Indonesia Fiber Corp., mostly owned by fiber giantTeijin Ltd. of Japan, is in the right place at the righttime.   In 1976, Teijin and minority investors began makingfilament yarn for Indonesia's domestic textile industry at aplant 15 miles west of Jakarta. It was a minor operation atfirst, as Indonesia only had a small industry. In recentyears, textile and garment exports have boomed, and PTTifico, as the company is known locally, has beenwell-positioned to ride the boom as the largest producer ofsome types of yarn needed by spinning and weaving companies.   The company is in the middle of a $147 million expansionproject, and by 1994 it expects to have the capacity to make150 metric tons a day of filament yarn, up from 90 metrictons at present.   Devaluations of Indonesia's currency have been the majorfactor affecting business here, says Shosaku Yasui, Tifico'spresident-director. They have been both good and bad for thecompany.   Tifico was hurt by devaluations of the rupiah in 1978 and1983, which depresssed Indonesia's economy and the domestictextile market. But a 1986 devaluation, combined with aseries of deregulation moves, fueled the textile export boom.With the buoyant demand, Mr. Yasui says, &quot;We startedexpanding in 1988, and we've been increasing production everyyear since then.&quot;   At present, the official says, Tifico's biggest problem isother companies' raids on its trained middle managers andsupervisors. Indonesia's economic growth has caused a severeshortage of middle managers, and he says competing fibermakers have been offering some salaries up to three timestheir current level.   Mr. Yasui describes Indonesia as a good place to invest,although newcomers may face power shortages. &quot;Lucky for us,we don't have this problem,&quot; he says. &quot;We have our own powerplant.&quot;   ---   Mr. Borsuk is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's Jakarta bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
