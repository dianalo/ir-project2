The money should be earmarked for the CHPteddy bear program (so patrol cars can have teddy bears for officers to giveto children in situations where children are frightened and need comforting).The $10 represents a reward I received from some stranded motorists lastFriday. The elderly couple were southbound on Interstate 880 and they hadtaken the southbound 280 off-ramp and ran out of gas. Besides being stranded,they had just come from the hospital where the husband had just had atracheotomy performed. I went and got them gas and followed them to a gasstation so they could fill up before getting home. When I returned, a CHPofficer had stopped and was with them to make sure they weren't stranded. Theyinsisted I take the money. I didn't feel right doing so and told them I woulddonate it to a charity.;   -- Bill Britton, Santa Clara  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CHP, OPERATION HUG AND CITIZEN EMBRACE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Action Line  </MEMO><TEXT>  A  Thanks are coming your way from Operation Hug, a program sponsored by theWomen's Assistance League of San Jose.

My husband (her stepfather) petitioned for herto become a citizen. So far, she hasn't received her alien registration card.I wrote to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and was told to file aform I-90. We did this on Sept. 30, 1988. More letters and visits haven'tproduced any answers.;   -- G. Bova, San Jose; A  Our INS contact couldn'tfind any record of the filing for an alien registration form for yourdaughter. This official had you and your daughter come to the San Jose officewhere the paper was processed. Your daughter now has a temporary alienregistration card and the official says the permanent one should arrive infour to six months. Your daughter's status was also noted on her passport sothere would be no problems.;   A lighter price; Q  On May 11, I attended theBerryessa Art and Wine Festival in Noble Park in San Jose. There was a boothwhere the artists were selling light-switch plates for $5 each. At thefestival I purchased several 49er plates. I would like to buy more for giftsfor friends but have no idea who these artists were or how to contact them. Ionly remember that they had come in from somewhere around theRoseville/Sacramento area. Any chance of finding out how I can reach them?;  -- M.C., San Jose; A  They're not from the Sacramento area. Lee Spanier isowner of Lights-On, which sold the 49er light-switch covers at the BerryessaArt and Wine Festival. Spanier says you can contact him at his home at 1434Arch St., Berkeley 94708 (415) 848-0857. He says those plates cost $5.50 each,but we gave him your name, so he will sell you what you want for the $5 priceyou paid when you attended the festival.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910820  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  605  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, August 20, 199100233146,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
