As the search for hidden explosives began, a committee of Sikhelders that manages the 400-year-old temple began trying to workout ways to reopen the temple to worshipers.   Police Chief K.P.S. Gill said workers found four bodies insidethe shrine Thursday, one day after the last of the militant Sikhsemerged and surrendered to Indian authorities.   ``We are still searching for dead men and arms. It may be by theweekend we can say it is all clear,'' Gill said.   A curfew was in effect in the temple's immediate vicinity.Residents were kept out of an area extending for 300 yards outsidethe walls of the sprawling complex.   The temple is the center for Sikh extremists who have waged aguerrilla war since 1982 for an independent Sikh homeland in therich farming state of Punjab. Sikhs are a religious minority inIndia but a majority in Punjab.   Forty-five men and one woman walked out of the temple Wednesdayduring a cease-fire by the 2,800 policemen, commandoes andparamilitary troops posted outside.   Twelve of the men, described by authorities as ``hard-coreterrorists,'' were charged with murder and possession of arms.   At least 46 people, mostly militant Sikhs, died in the siege,according to official statements. Four other militants committedsuicide.   Despite the government's success in ending the siege, itsauthority is still challenged by continuing Sikh attacks elsewherein Punjab state.   The United News of India said Sikh gunmen shot and killed 25people across Punjab in seven separate overnight attacks, raisingthe death toll since the start of the year to 1,088.   At least 40 people were killed Tuesday and Wednesday, including30 migrant Hindu laborers shot to death as they slept at a campnear the state capital, Chandigarh. A note found near the laborers'bodies said the killings were to avenge the siege of the GoldenTemple.   The temple siege _ the strongest government anti-terroristaction since a 1984 army raid on the shrine _ began May 9 afterSikh extremists inside fired at police commanders on an inspectiontour outside the temple. Five officers were injured.   Eight hundred pilgrims and temple workers were evacuated fromthe temple May 10, and 146 people, including some Sikh extremists,surrendered during a cease-fire Sunday.   During the surrender Wednesday, the last of the militantsemerged from the temple in small groups and were taken forquestioning by police.</TEXT></DOC>
