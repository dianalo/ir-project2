News of the write-offs, following similar disclosures earlier this year, hammered Honeywell stock and raised a question of management credibility among some Wall Street securities analysts. &quot;They're suggesting they bought a can of worms&quot; with the 1986 acquisition of Unisys Corp.'s Sperry aerospace group, said George Podrasky of Duff andamp; Phelps Inc., Chicago.    Honeywell stock fell $2.75 to close at $58.75 a share in composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday.    The new write-offs come on the heels of Honeywell's June announcement it expected to take a $23 million charge against second-quarter earnings for cost overruns and asset write-downs in its defense avionics systems division, which includes Sperry's military avionics unit. By the time the quarter's results were announced, the figure had risen to $27 million.    The write-offs raise questions about the $1.03 billion acquisition Honeywell hoped would give it a leadership role in the avionics industry. At the time the company had called the acquisition &quot;a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&quot;    Honeywell said yesterday that it would take additional charges in the current quarter because of &quot;inadequate contract cost recognition practices and asset write-offs&quot; in its defense avionics division. It didn't specify the charges.    A Honeywell spokeswoman said that while many of the uncovered problems were inherited in the Unisys unit's acquisition, other problems may have been part of Honeywell's avionics unit, which merged with the Unisys business. Those problems &quot;predate Honeywell's implementation in 1985 of tougher contract management policies,&quot; she said. She wouldn't elaborate.    The company said the problems, discovered by an internal audit team, proved &quot;deeper and more widespread than originally thought.&quot; Asked whether Honeywell believed it had identified all such problems, the spokeswoman said, &quot;We continue to scrutinize the division. . . . This is a very complex business, and therefore the company can never be completely certain.&quot;    Honeywell also said yesterday it is considering a further restructuring of its Solid State Electronics division by year end. In the second quarter, the company took an after-tax charge of $16 million related to losses on the division's semiconductor product line.    Besides the repeated charges, Honeywell said profit for the year might be affected by adoption of an accounting change for deferred taxes, which could result in a charge to earnings.    The company wouldn't disclose the depth or specifics of the latest series of contract problems in the defense avionics business, but the second-quarter write-offs related primarily to test equipment on the Air Force's advanced F-15E two-seat fighter and avionics equipment on the B-52 long-range bomber.    As a result of its audit, Honeywell replaced the Sperry military avionics unit's top management and implemented what the company called &quot;very disciplined contract management procedures.&quot;    Yesterday's announcement surprised and disappointed analysts. &quot;This damages management credibility,&quot; said Mr. Podrasky. &quot;You would think they would have provided an extra cushion in there&quot; in the initial write-downs. And Barry J. Tarasoff, who follows Honeywell for Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co., agreed that the latest disclosure raises questions of credibility. &quot;When they had the first write-off, they said they thought they had it behind them. That might suggest some small amounts slopping over, but this sounds like some significant amounts.&quot;    Asked whether Honeywell was contemplating seeking compensation from Unisys, the spokeswoman replied, &quot;We can't comment on that.&quot;    Unisys couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
