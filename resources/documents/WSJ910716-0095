Increases in the tax rates on income are on the way inMinnesota and probably in California. New Jersey, of course,got an early start with Jim Florio's uproarious package lastyear; so did Kentucky. But 10 states have somehow avoided alevy on wages and salaries all these years, and so they'regetting a lot of attention now in the running debate overtaxes and growth.</LP><TEXT>   In Connecticut, Lowell Weicker brought home the fervor forgrand government that was one of the hallmarks of his saladdays in the nation's capital. He wants a billion-dollar taxboost, keyed to an income tax. Some folks there would insteadraise the state's sales tax (already the nation's highest)still more. Big Business has bought Gov. Weicker's line aboutcutting its tax in return for an income tax, as have someinvestors who pay a 14% rate on &quot;unearned income.&quot; Both thesecamps may find themselves with an earnings tax and littlerelief on the side.   A similar situation in Tennessee was headed off when thelegislature quashed Gov. Ned McWherter's income-tax schemeand told him to cut the budget instead. He did. But a courtorder to equalize school financing (a familiar story) may belooming, and this could restart the governor's campaign intime for a fall special session. In any event, Tennesseanscan count the absence of an income tax as one reason theirstate expenditure problem isn't as bad as Kentucky's nextdoor.   Comparisons between adjoining states can be goodindicators of what a difference freedom from an income taxmakes. South Dakota, for example, enjoys a much lightergovernment burden than North Dakota. New Hampshire isfamously less fettered than Vermont. Texas and Florida arethe only big states with relatively small public sectors,though that may change as both could see special legislativesessions later this year to consider income taxes.   The James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, Fla., studiedwhat happened in the eight states that added income leviesbetween 1969 and 1976. It found that in all but one,government growth rates jumped up when the tax was imposedand remain above their pre-tax trend line today. The soleexception is Pennsylvania, which is also the only one of thegroup to have lowered, rather than raised, the rate at whichthe tax was first imposed.   The fact that a tax is difficult to get rid of onceestablished, and tends to increase in severity, leads DavidKeating, an official of the National Taxpayers Union, to urgethat it be resisted at the outset, no matter how dire astate's &quot;temporary&quot; fiscal crisis may be. Referendums, wherethey are allowed, are a quick way to undo a scheme that can'tbe stopped in the legislature.   As we've noted before, there's evidence that manyAmericans still vote with their feet on tax policy -- withmigration flowing away from income-tax progressivism andtoward the greater opportunity seen in low-income-tax states.While restless feet may always remain the ultimate votingdevice, it would save wear and tear on millions of folks ifthe politicians in the states could just keep the tax groundfrom shifting beneath them.</TEXT></DOC>
