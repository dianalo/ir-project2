McKay.   McKAY'S CONCLUSION: Finishing a 14-month investigation, McKayissued a report saying Meese probably broke two tax laws and twiceviolated a criminal conflict-of-interest statute. However, he tolda news conference that ``I have decided that we will notprosecute'' _ a decision ``based on prosecutorial discretion.''   MEESE'S RESPONSE: Meese declared that he was outraged andappalled by McKay's findings, saying that if Justice Departmentlawyers had issued such a document ``they'd be fired.'' Decrying``the tarnishing of our system of justice,'' Meese contended thatMcKay had ``violated every principle of fairness and decency.''   TAXES: McKay said in his report that ``A trier of fact wouldprobably conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Meeseviolated'' a section of the Internal Revenue Code by filing ``amaterially false tax return.'' He said Meese and his wife failed toreport a net capital gain of $20,706 on the sale of $54,581 insecurities in 1985.   McKay also said Meese probably also violated a section of theInternal Revenue Code for ``willfully failing to pay tax at thetime required by law.''   CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST: According to McKay, Meese probablyviolated the conflict-of-interest law in connection with hisholdings of $14,000 in regional Bell telephone stock. Meese ownedthe stock in 1985 and 1986, when he set in motion a review processthat led to a reversal of Justice Department policy on the regionalBell companies.   McKay also found that Meese participated in discussions ofproposed legislation to shift regulatory responsibility for thebreakup of ATandamp;T from a federal court and the Justice Department tothe Federal Communications Commission.   CONGRESSIONAL REACTION: Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina,ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, ``Itappears from the special counsel's report the attorney general didnot exercise good judgment in a number of instances. The attorneygeneral has announced his pending resignation and I hope ... thisreport finally puts this matter to rest.''   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of a Senate subcommittee thatinvestigated Meese's involvement in the Wedtech scandal, said ofthe McKay report: ``The findings I believe are devastating to Mr.Meese, to his claim that he has been ethical. How anyone other thanEd Meese could claim that this report vindicates him is beyond me.''</TEXT></DOC>
