<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-46-0747 </DOCNO><TEXT>An extended series of experiments has been used to investigate transitionradiation in the X-ray spectral region. The X-rays were generated atthe Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory electron-positron linear acceleratorby 54 MeV electrons traversing multiple thin-foil targets. The measuredangular and spectral distributions have shown excellent agreement withcalculated predictions based on a simplified theoretical descriptionof transition radiation. Recently, energy-resolved measurements of X-raygeneration by targets consisting of multiple closely-spaced foils hasclearly demonstrated the longitudinal coherence of transition radiation.This behavior might lead to a variety of applications such as tuneablenarrow-band X-ray sources, measurement of X-ray dielectric constants,or particle beam diagnostics. These issues will be discussed and recentresults will be presented.</TEXT></DOC>
