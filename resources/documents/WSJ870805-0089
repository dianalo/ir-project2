Coastal becomes the fourth pipeline company or consortium of companies seeking regulatory approval to construct major natural-gas lines to Kern County. In addition, two California-based companies already are providing natural gas to the heavy-oil fields, where pumping stations consume great quantities of fuel in lifting the sludge-like crude oil to the surface.    Complicating matters further is a continuing fight between the state of California and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over who has jurisdiction over pipeline construction and operations in the area.    Analysts said that despite the area's growing need for natural gas, the area can only support one additional pipeline. &quot;FERC may consolidate to give all the companies a piece of the action,&quot; said John Olson, pipeline analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;There's not enough space to accommodate four.&quot; Even one new, major pipeline into the region, he said, could more than double the area's receipts of natural gas.    In announcing its effort to obtain FERC approval, Coastal called its proposed 1,000-mile pipeline &quot;one of the largest such construction projects proposed in recent years in the U.S.&quot; Based on Coastal's projections, its pipeline would cost more than twice that of a much shorter pipeline from Arizona proposed by the Mojave Project, a joint venture of Houston-based Enron Corp. and Seattle-based Burlington Northern Railroad Holding Co.    &quot;There is a sufficient requirement for gas in the enhanced-oil recovery needs of the region to warrant construction of the pipeline,&quot; said Michael G. Morris, president of Wyoming-California Pipeline Co., the Coastal unit that would own the pipeline.    A Coastal spokesman asserted that regulators may look more favorably on the company's proposal over those of its competitors. For one, the Coastal project would draw natural gas from a diversity of sources, including the Overthrust Belt of Wyoming, the Gulf Coast and Canada. In addition, he said, Coastal would operate the pipeline as an &quot;open access&quot; carrier, meaning that it would provide cartage for any natural-gas supplier, rather than merely to transport natural-gas supplies that it has secured.    Though the outcome of the dispute between California and federal regulators is unclear, the energy commission is going ahead with hearings on the pipeline proposals scheduled to resume Sept. 17. On that date, two of the four would-be pipeline operators will present their cases before an administrative law judge.    A third proposal has been preliminarily dismissed because of lack of action by the sponsor. In addition, the commission has been reviewing ways to supply more natural gas to the oil fields without major, new pipeline construction.    Though a FERC spokeswoman said it wasn't certain whether the Coastal proposal would be heard at the next hearing, the Coastal spokesman said the company expects its proposal to receive prompt attention. Because of the nature of its application, the spokesman added, Coastal expects to be exempt from certain preliminary hearings. </TEXT></DOC>
