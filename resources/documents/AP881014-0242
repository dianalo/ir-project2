Hussein Sheikholeslam, a deputy foreign minister for Arab andAfrican affairs, spoke at a news conference late Thursday in Dubai,the United Arab Emirates, where he stopped en route to Kenya.   He said Republican candidate George Bush and Democraticcandidate Michael Dukakis made contact with Iran through thirdparties, including governments and individuals.   Bush has denied this, and officials in Washington insist theUnited States has no direct or indirect contacts with the Iranians.   Sheikholeslam said the identity of the intermediaries is ``atouchy question'' and that he did not want to get involved ``in theelection games of the United States.''   But he said the contacts were not at the level of thoseconducted in 1986 that led to the Irangate scandal, in which armswere secretly sold to Iran. He did not elaborate.   Sheikholeslam stressed that normalizing relations with theUnited States should be separated from the issue of the hostagesheld in Lebanon.   Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem militants are believed to hold mostof the 14 Westerners missing in Lebanon. Nine of the captives areAmerican.   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Sheikholeslam said Iran also was concerned about four Iranianswho have been missing in Lebanon for six years.   He said that while Iran was appealing for the release of itsnationals, it was not necessarily linking their fate to that of the14 Westerners.   Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani Sadr, who lives inexile in Paris, said recently that Richard Lawless, a former U.S.official, negotiated with Iranian government representatives onbehalf of Bush for the release of the American hostages.   In Washington on Friday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwaterdenied again that the U.S. government was negotiating with Iran.   Fitzwater took issue with a report Friday in The Nation, aJerusalem weekly, that talks on the hostages were held but recessedbecause of news leaks.   ``No one is authorized to talk for the (U.S.) government,'' hesaid. ``As we have said before, there are all kinds of peoplearound the world freelancing on this situation.''   Fitzwater also predicted more such stories, although he did notsay why.   ``Suffice it to say, we find them (the news reports) mostlydetrimental,'' he said. ``What they do is build up people'sexpectations when they are not warranted.''</TEXT></DOC>
