Last year, 50 Texas banks failed to set a national record. Sofar this year, 23 have failed. Another 179 state-chartered banksare on the regulators' problem list and Littlefield said Tuesdaythat few will last until the state economy makes a rebound.   He blamed troubled real estate loans for accelerating theclosure rates. In addition, he said problem assets are squeezingnet interest margins and forcing losses for the banks.   But if the banks sell off those assets in a falling market, itcould mean even more losses as the banks absorb the differencebetween the book and market values.   ``A good number of Texas banks are in an almost helplesssituation,'' said Littlefield, who is encouraging federal aid forbanks rather than closing the institutions. ``Through moreaggressive use of open-bank assistance, much can be done (to help)the smaller banks.''   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported Texas banks lostalmost $2 billion in 1987 and had $12.63 billion in bad loans andrepossed properties at the end of the year _ a 44 percent increaseover 1986.   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said owners of failing banks oftendon't ask for assistance because they feel their case is hopeless.Whitney said FDIC is working to merge failing banks to pay offdepositors.   Of the 23 Texas failures, 13 were merged with other banks.</TEXT></DOC>
