The proposed rule would provide that afterthree years from its adoption, in determining whether to grant, modify,or revoke any order of exemption under section 3(a)(1) (15 U.S.C. 79c(a)(1))of the Act, the Commission shall not deem interests of any intrastate public-utilityholding company in non-utility businesses to be detrimental to the publicinterest or the interest of investors or consumers within the meaning ofthe ``unless and except'' clause of section 3(a) (15 U.S.C. 79c(a)) ofthe Act\1\<NOTE/> if either (a)(i) the interests in businesses which are notfunctionally related (``unrelated'') to the operations of public-utilityaffiliates of the holding company are of limited size, as specified inthe rule, to assure that the public-utility business remains the primarybusiness of the holding-company system and that the extent of the risksto utility operations from possible financial reversals of unrelated activitiesand the possible effect of those activities on the filling of capital needsfor utility purposes are limited; and (ii) certain other conditions aresatisfied which are intended to insulate the utility business to the extentpossible from legal liabilities stemming from non-utility operations andto prevent the diversion of utility resources for non-utility purposes;or (b)(i) the state has enacted a statute governing the formation and/oroperations of intrastate public-utility holding companies and their affiliates;(ii) the state has considered, or authorized the appropriate state commissionto consider, the issue of diversification of intrastate public-utilityholding companies into non-utility businesses in light of the public policygoals of the Act, and the state and/or state commission has written policieswith regard to such diversification; and (iii) the holding company is incompliance with any state statute and any state commission rules, regulationsand orders pertaining to diversification activities. Holding companiesexempt under section 3(a)(1) of the Act by order of the Commission whenrule 17 and the related proposals become effective would have a one-time,and then an annual, filing requirement of certain information requiredof companies claiming exemption under rule 2(a)(1) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\Section 3(a)(1), in essence, provides that the Commission,by rules and regulations, or by order upon application, shall exempt anypredominantly intrastate holding company (and its subsidiaries) from anyprovision or provisions of the Act ``<T3>unless and except </T3>insofar as <T3>it finds the exemption detrimental to the public interest or the interestof investors or consumers.</T3>'' 15 U.S.C. 79c(a)(1) (emphasis added).Holding companies not exempted by section 3(a)(1) are not the subject ofthis proposed rulemaking because their diversification activities, if any,are already subject to appropriate review, or because diversification isnot relevant to their operations. Section 3(a)(2) exempts a holding companythat is predominantly a public-utility company. Such a company's diversifiedactivities, whether conducted directly as a division of the holding company,or through a subsidiary, make it possible for state regulatory authoritiesto monitor and delimit such activities in the context of ratemaking orthe approval of security issuances. Section 3(a)(3) exempts a holding companythat is primarily engaged in an industrial or other non-utility businesswhere the utility subsidiary is functionally related to the (primary) non-utilitybusiness. Section 3(a)(4) exempts a holding company that is temporarilya holding company by reason of the acquisition of securities for purposesof liquidation or distribution in connection with a bona fide debt previouslycontracted, or in connection with a bona fide arrangement for the underwritingor distribution of securities. Section 3(a)(5) affords an exemption onlywhen the utility operations conducted by a holding company are such thatthe holding company's utility interests are essentially foreign and includeat most a small or minor domestic utility.(2) An amendment of rule 2 under the Act that would provide that afterthree years from its adoption, any intrastate public-utility holding company,and every subsidiary company thereof as such, upon the filing of an exemptionstatement on form U-3A-2 under the Act initially and as required each yearthereafter, shall be exempt from all the provisions of the Act and therules thereunder, except section 9(a)(2) (15 U.S.C. 79i(a)(2)) of the Act,if, in addition to satisfying present paragraph (a)(1) of rule 2, suchholding company meets one of the safe harbor provisions of rule 17. A special,one-time filing of form U-3A-2 will be required following the effectivedate of amended rule 2 for entities which can claim exempt status underrule 2(a)(1) on such effective date.(3) an amendment of form U-3A-2 to require intrastate holding companiesclaiming exemption under rule 2 to furnish information supporting the company'sability to rely on one of the safe harbor provisions of rule 17.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>1. Purpose of the Section 3(a)(1) ExemptionIn adopting the Act, Congress determined to exempt from any provision orprovisions of the Act a public-utility holding company that although engagedin interstate commerce, has an essentially intrastate character.\2\<NOTE/> Congress' decision is consistent with indications in theAct's legislative history that a major purpose of the Act was to createa system to control public-utility holding companies that escaped effectivestate regulation because of their interstate activities.\3\<NOTE/> While Congress' purpose in adopting the section 3(a)(1) exemptionis not entirely explicit, it appears that Congress believed that a companythat is ``predominantly intrastate'' could be effectively controlled bythe state in which it is primarily located.\4\<NOTE/> This assessment is supported by the Senate and House Reports,which state that a predominantly intrastate company is ``essentially notthe kind of public-utility holding compan[y] at which the purposes of thelegislation are directed * * *.''\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ H.R.

Other parts of the legislative history discussparticular difficulties faced by states in regulating interstate holdingcompany systems. For example, the House Report describes a holding-company'skeeping of its books in a state other than the one in which it is located,in order to escape effective state regulation, as ``* * * [o]ne of themost obstructive features of the holding-company device from the pointof view of State regulation of local' operating companies.''

Operation of Sections 3(a)(1) and 3(c)Section 3(a)(1) of the Act provides that the Commission ``shall'' grantan exemption from ``any provision or provisions'' of the Act and the rulesthereunder to a predominantly intrastate   holding company and its subsidiaries``unless and except'' the Commission finds the exemption ``detrimentalto the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers'' (hereinafterreferred to as ``protected interests'').\6\<NOTE/> The terms ``provision or provisions'' allow for a partialexemption; that is, the Commission can condition or qualify an exemption,or limit an exemption to particular provisions of the Act.\7\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The original draft of S. 2796 provided that the Commission``may exempt'' a holding company. This was amended to ``shall exempt''in order to remove the Commission's discretion whether to grant an exemption.79 Cong. Rec. 8391, 8394, 8395 (Wheeler). Nevertheless, Congress made itclear that the Commission retained the ability to make certain that theexemptions conformed to the Act's purposes: By thus imposing a mandatoryduty upon the Commission to exempt companies falling within defined categoriesexcept where such exemption is definitely detrimental to the basic purposesof the statute, the Committee has felt free to broaden the exemptions beyondwhat would be justified if the exemptions had been made unqualified andself-operative and beyond the power of the Commission to correct when abusedor used to circumvent the purposes of the title.

Relationship of Detriment to Diversification To determine the meaning of ``detrimental'' in the context of the ``unlessand except'' clause of section 3(a), and the extent to which ``diversification''is to be considered in the analysis, it is necessary to consider the languageof the statute and its purpose, as well as the Act's legislative history.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Section 1: Abuses Sought To Be Eliminated by the Act </ITAG>Non-utility diversification and investment in speculative ventures by publicutility holding companies was of concern to Congress in the passage ofthe Act. To eliminate the abuses identified in section 1(b)(4)\10\<NOTE/> and other abuses and to further the Act's policies, Congressadopted section 11(b) (15 U.S.C. 79k(b)) which by its terms applies onlyto registered holding companies.\11\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Section 1(b)(4) provides that a detriment to protectedinterests exists when the growth and extension of holding companies bearsno relation to economy of management and operation or the integration andcoordination of related operating properties. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Section 11(b)(1) (15 U.S.C. 79k(b)(1)) requires a registeredholding company to limit its utility operations essentially to ``a singleintegrated public-utility system.'' Section 11(b)(1) also forbids a registeredholding company from diversifying into any non-utility business unlessthat business is ``reasonably incidental or economically necessary or appropriate''to its utility operations. With respect to section 11(b)(1), it has beenthe Commission's consistent interpretation, subject to certain limitedexceptions, that a registered holding company may not engage in a non-utilitybusiness unless it is functionally related to the operations of the public-utilitysystem of the holding company. <T3>See Michican Consolidated Gas Co. v. S.E.C </T3>444 F.2d 913 (D.C.Cir. 1971). Congress did not make strict compliance with section 11(b)(1) a prerequisiteto obtaining an intrastate exemption under section 3(a)(1).\12\<NOTE/> Thus, it appears that Congress did not intend that diversification<T3>per se </T3>should make an exemption under section 3(a)(1) unavailable.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ <T3>See North American Co. v. S.E.C., </T3>327 U.S. at 698-99: Not allcompanies that are engaged in interstate activities, however, must necessarilycomply with section 11(b)(1). By the terms of section 3(a)(1), if a holdingcompany and all of its subsidiaries are predominantly intrastate in character* * * the Commission may grant an exemption from any provision of the Actunless and except insofar as it finds the exemption detrimental to thepublic interest * * * There also are indications in the legislative historythat ``the exemptions granted to such companies (pursuant to section 3(a))would, of course, free them from the provisions of Section 11.'' 79 Cong.Rec. at 10359 (statement of Congressman Eicher). Since intrastate holding companies meeting the provisions of section 3(a)are not prohibited from non-utility diversification <T3>per se, </T3>it is the Commission's obligation under section 3(a)(1)to determine the circumstances in which such diversification is or couldbe detrimental to protected interests and, therefore, provide a basis fordenying an exemption.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Section 11(b): Exempt Company Diversification. </ITAG>In the early years of the administration of the Act, the Commission insome cases granted exemptions under section 3(a), which permitted retentionof non-utility properties that were not functionally related to the operationsof public-utility companies. The Commission did not press for full compliancewith the standards of section 11(b)(1) only as a matter of discretion,not for lack of authority under the Act.\13\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ This basis for Commission action was made explicit bythe Commission in <T3>Public Service Corp. of New Jersey, </T3>27 S.E.C. 682, 706-08 (1948).More recently, the Commission, on a few occasions, has considered the availabilityof a section 3(a)(1) exemption and the extent to which section 11(b)(1)should be applied to intrastate public utility holding companies that diversifyinto, especially, unrelated non-utility areas.\14\<NOTE/> The most extensive, albeit inconclusive, consideration ofthe subject is found in <T3>Pacific Lighting Corp., </T3>45 S.E.C. 152 (1973), where four Commissionersconsidered for the first time whether a predominantly intrastate holdingcompany's diversification into non-utility businesses made its continuedexemption detrimental to protected interests within the meaning of the``unless and except'' clause. Because a majority of the Commission consideringthe issue were unable to agree on whether Pacific Lighting met the appropriatestandards, the company retained its exemption.\15\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ The Commission, in construing section 11(b)(1)in  relationto <T3>registered </T3>holding companies, has adopted what has been referredto as the ``functional relationship'' test. <T3>Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. v. S.E.C., </T3>444 F.2d 913, 916-17(D.C. Cir. 1971), <T3>citing North American Co. </T3>v.<T3> S.E.C., </T3>327 U.S. at 697 (dicta approving functional relationshiptest). To retain (or acquire pursuant to sections 9 and 10) a particularnon-utility business, a registered holding company or its subsidiary mustshow that its ``other business'' is reasonably incidental or economicallynecessary or appropriate to the operations of such integrated public-utilitysystem, and that the retention of the other business is necessary or appropriatein the public interest. <T3>Id. </T3>at 916. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ A similar result was reached in <T3>National Utilities andamp; Industries Corp., </T3>45 S.E.C. 167 (1973).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>Recently, substantial diversification activities by some exempt intrastateholding companies have raised questions concerning whether these companiescontinue to be entitled to their exemptions from the Act.\16\<NOTE/> Moreover, utilities whose major construction projects arecompleted or nearing completion or have been deferred because the increaseddemand for utility services, at least temporarily, has slowed or haltedmay be expected, because of surplus retained earnings, to increase unrelatednon-utility business investment.\17\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ As of October 31, 1988, there were 88 companies thatclaimed exemption under rule 2 as intrastate holding companies. About one-halfof such claimants had only non-utility interests that were functionallyrelated to the utility operations of the holding-company system. The othersdivide roughly equally into two groups: One group consisted of claimantswith 10% or more of consolidated assets attributable to non-utility, non-functionallyrelated interests; the other group comprised claimants that were less diversified.Of the 34 companies exempted by order of the Commission under section 3(a)(1),about one-fifth appeared to be significantly diversified at that date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Other possibilities for surplus earnings are: (1) Payhigher dividends to shareholders; (2) repurchase common stock; (3) retiredebt and preferred stock; (4) diversify into functionally related non-utilityprojects; (5) expand current plant beyond anticipated needs; (6) hold liquidcapital for potential increase in plant capacity; and (7) decrease consumerrates.When an exempt public-utility holding company engages in non-utility activities,there is a potential for detriment to protected interests.\18\<NOTE/> Should non-utility investments prove unsuccessful, the investmentcaliber of the exempt holding company's securities may decline, the costsof raising additional capital for contribution to utility affiliates mayrise, and the rates charged to consumers, which support the securities,may become higher than might otherwise be necessary. Other potential detrimentsthat could result from non-utility diversification include the transferof expertise and management acumen created within a utility to non-utilityventures, cost-shifting to the utility, utility purchases from non-utilityaffiliates at above market prices, and the potential for decreased reliabilityof utility service.\19\<NOTE/> On the other hand, diversification by  holding companiesinto areas unrelated to their core business could translate into improvedearnings prospects for investors and could be potentially beneficial toconsumers by reducing the utility's cost of capital and improving its accessto the capital markets. To clarify the appropriate standards for permittingdiversification activities of exempt intrastate holding companies, theCommission, pursuant to its authority under the Act, is publishing forcomment this proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Actual harm to investors, consumers, or the public interestis not required to invoke the ``unless and except'' clause. The Commissionhas recognized that potential harm to protected interests is itself a detrimenteven though no actual harm has yet occurred. <T3>Standard Oil Co., </T3>10 S.E.C. 1122, 1129 (1942), <T3>citing Detroit Edison Co. v. S.E.C., </T3>119 F.2d 730, 739 (1941).(``The statute contemplates action prospectively. It is a preventive measureintended to regulate action before the interests of those concerned areadversely affected.'') <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC'') hasalso recognized the potential detriments of an unfettered diversificationprogram. Twice recently, first in <T3>Central Vermont Public Service Corp., </T3>39 FERC Para. 61,295 (1987),and then in <T3>Central Illinois Public Service Co., </T3>Docket No. EL 87-60-000 (January20, 1988), FERC invoked the provisions of section 203 of the Federal PowerAct to assert jurisdiction over the formation of a new holding company.In <T3>Central Vermont, </T3>FERC stated its reasons for asserting jurisdictionas follows: Reorganizations wherein a jurisdictional public utility becomesthe wholly-owned subsidiary of a parent holding company may present potentialfor abuses adverse to the public interest. <T3>To the extent that utility revenues are used to finance non-utilityoperations, the cost of utility services may be increased. If the parentmakes unwise investment decisions the reliability of service of jurisdictionalfacilities could be impaired. </T3>This aspect of the holding company/operatingutility relationship was a concern to those who enacted Title II of thePublic Utility Act. (Footnote omitted.) We are asserting jurisdiction overthis type of transaction so that in cases where (FERC) finds sufficientpotential for abuse, (FERC) may disapprove the transaction, or place appropriateconditions on the use of operating utility funds, pursuant to its authorityunder section 203(b) of the statute (emphasis added). We believe that the issues are most appropriately addressed through rulemaking.That process does not call into doubt the exempt status of any companythat has substantially diversified into unrelated non-utility businesses.Rather, as a safe harbor  15 rule, rule 17 does not express the only circumstancesin which diversification activities may be conducted without constitutingdetriment to protected interests. Moreover, our proposals afford a periodof three years from their adoption for (1) an exempt intrastate public-utilityholding company to adjust its degree of diversification in businesses unrelatedto its utility operations and satisfy certain other conditions or (2) theholding company's state of organization to provide a regulatory structuremeeting the requirements of the ``state'' safe harbor set forth in paragraph(a)(2) of rule 17. At the end of the three-year period, any company exempt by order wouldcontinue to be exempt until, under section 3(c) of the Act, the Commissionby order revoked its order. Claimants under rule 2 with investments inunrelated non-utility businesses at the end of such three-year period andnot able to meet one of the safe harbor provisions of rule 17 would losetheir exemptions at that time and would either have to register or filegood faith applications for exemptions which would afford temporary exemptionspending Commission action on the applications. 1. The Proposed New Rule The Commission believes Congress intended that the Act, among other things,regulate holding companies that escaped effective state regulation becauseof their interstate activities.\20\<NOTE/>  Congress also intended that the Commission have jurisdictionover companies exempt from the Act under section 3(a)(1) as predominantlyintrastate. In addition, Congress did not intend that exempt intrastatecompanies be subject to section 11(b)(1) prohibitions against non-utilitydiversification to the same extent as registered companies. The nature,extent, and structure of such diversification and the regulatory environmentin which it occurs would be relevant in the Commission's determinationwhether there is a detriment to protected interests that would limit theavailability of an exemption under section 3(a)(1).\21\<NOTE/> Where the  relevant state has made a judgment that diversificationwould not conflict with its ability to exercise regulatory control andthat control is manifested in a state public-utility holding company statute,an exemption from the Act under section 3(a)(1) for a predominantly intrastatecompany which has, or intends to have, diversification activities wouldbe consistent with the purposes of the Act.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Section 1(a)(5) (15 U.S.C. 79a(a)(5)) states that public-utilityholding companies and their subsidiary companies are affected with a nationalpublic interest in that, among other things, ``their activities extendingover many States are not susceptible of effective control by any Stateand make difficult, if not impossible, effective State regulation of public-utilitycompanies.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Consistent with the legislative history supporting theview that a major purpose of the Act is to control public-utility holdingcompanies that escape effective state regulation, the Commission's decisionshave at times given weight to the determinations of local authorities whenanalyzing the issue of detriment. In late 1986, in approving a restructuringtransaction by Wisconsin Energy Corporation (``WEC'') that essentiallychanged the basis for the company's exemption from section 3(a)(2) (15U.S.C. 79c(a)(2)) to section 3(a)(1), the Commission reiterated its positionthat the ``unless and except'' clause does not subject unregistered holdingcompanies to the diversification limits of section 11(b)(1) to the sameextent as registered holding companies. <T3>Wisconsin Energy Corp., </T3>HCAR No. 24267, 37 SEC Docket 387 (December18, 1986). The Commission noted that there was a comprehensive Wisconsinlaw governing the formation and operation of utility holding companiesand an order of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (``PSCW'') limitingWEC's investment in non-utility assets to approximately 25% of holding-companyassets, ensuring that the holding company would maintain its predominantlyutility orientation. The Commission found that WEC's diversification activities,as specifically limited by the Wisconsin statute and PSCW order, wouldnot be detrimental to carrying out the provisions of section 11(b)(1),as they might be applied to intrastate exempt holding companies under the``unless and except'' clause of section 3(a). <T3>Id. </T3>at 395. <ITAG tagnum="28">More recently, the Commission took the same position regarding diversificationit had taken in WEC in a very similar restructuring by another Wisconsinintrastate holding company. </ITAG><T3>WPL Holding, Inc., </T3>HCAR No. 24590, 40 SEC Docket 634 (February26, 1988).Accordingly, and assuming no other basis existed for denying an exemptionunder section 3(a)(1), the proposed rule would provide a ``state'' safeharbor under the following circumstances: _The state has enacted a statute governing the formation and/or operationsof intrastate public-utility holding companies and their affiliates; _The state has considered, or authorized the appropriate state commissionto consider, the issue of diversification of intrastate public-utilityholding companies into non-utility businesses in light of the public policygoals of the Act, and the state and/or state commission has written policieswith regard to such diversification; and _The holding company is in compliance with any state statute and any statecommission rules, regulations and orders pertaining to diversificationactivities. The Commission recognizes that this formulation may be perceived as notreflecting the degree of state involvement appropriate under the Act. Specificcomment is invited concerning alternative standards for the state safeharbor that would provide greater assurance to the Commission that thepurposes and policies of the Act were being followed. Not all states, however, have enacted or may enact a statutory structureaddressing diversification. In the absence of a state judgment as to whatis necessary for it to exercise regulatory control over diversificationby intrastate holding companies, the rule would provide a ``regulatory''safe harbor for companies seeking to diversify. In addition, should stateregulation of diversification prove to be ineffective in safeguarding protectedinterests, the Commission could amend its rules to provide only for a ``regulatory''safe harbor. Paragraph (a) of the proposed rule sets forth the general proposition ofthe safe harbors that, on and after three years from the adoption of therule, for purposes of the ``unless and except'' clause in section 3(a),interests in non-utility businesses would not be deemed detrimental tothe protected interests specified in that clause in either of two situations.Paragraph (a)(1) states the conditions of the ``regulatory'' safe harborprovision. The first three conditions are intended to insulate the utilitybusiness of an intrastate holding company to the extent possible from beingadversely affected by losses in non-utility operations and to prevent thediversion of utility resources for non-utility purposes. The fourth conditionwould require that each unrelated non-utility interest, and the totalityof such interests, be limited in size, relative too the consolidated assetsof the holding company, and therefore that all other non-utility interestsbe attributable to functionally related businesses, that is, businessesa registered holding company could retain. Paragraph (a)(2) is the ``state'' safe harbor provision, which providesthat the Commission would not withhold exemption on the basis of diversificationif (i) the state of organization of the holding company has enacted a statutegoverning the formation and/or operations of intrastate public-utilityholding companies and their affiliates; (ii) the state has considered,or authorized the appropriate state commission to consider, the issue ofdiversification of intrastate public-utility holding companies into non-utilitybusinesses in light of the public policy goals of the Act, and the stateand/or state commission has written policies with regard to such diversification;and (iii) the holding company is in compliance with any state statute andany state commission rules, regulations and orders pertaining to diversificationactivities. Holding companies exempt under section 3(a)(1) by order of the Commissionwhen rule 17 and the related proposals become effective would have a one-time,and then an annual, filing requirement of certain information requiredof companies claiming exemption under rule 2(a)(1) under the Act to enablethe Commission to determine if a safe harbor is available. Where none isavailable, the Commission would determine whether to initiate a proceedingto revoke the exempt company's order because of changed circumstances andpotential detriment to protected interests. The rule would have no force or effect for a period of three years afterits adoption to allow affected companies to make any necessary adjustments,or to allow states to enact the appropriate public-utility holding companylegislation to achieve regulatory control over intrastate holding companies.2. The Proposed Amendment to Rule 2 There are two ways an intrastate holding company can obtain an exemption:by order upon application under section 3 or under rule 2. Rule 2(a)(1)allows a company to obtain the exemption afforded by section 3(a)(1) byfiling a claim of exemption on form U-3A-2. Such a claim exempts the holdingcompany from all provisions of the Act (except section 9(a)(2)). No noticeis published and no order is issued, but the claim must be renewed by annualfilings on or before March l of each year.\22\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Under rule 6, the exemption may be terminated by a registeredletter from the Commission stating that a question exists about the holdingcompany's entitlement to the exemption. A company receiving a terminationletter has 30 days to either register under the Act or file a formal applicationfor an exemption which, if filed in good faith, exempts the company fromthe Act until the Commission issues a final order. The Commission is proposing an amendment to rule 2 to provide that, onand after three years from the adoption of the amendment, claims of exemptionby an intrastate public-utility holding company would, <T3>in order to be effective, </T3>require that, in addition to satisfyingparagraph (a)(1) of rule 2, such holding company meet one of the safe harborprovisions of rule 17. Companies relying on rule 2 on its effective datewould have 60 days in which to file an updated form U-3A-2, as proposedto be amended. Claimants who could no longer rely on amended rule 2, wheneffective, because they did not come within one of the safe harbor provisionsof rule 17, may be able to file a good faith application for an order ofthe Commission under section 3(a)(1). In any proceeding on such an application,unrelated non-utility investments would not be presumed to be detrimentalto protected interests.3. The Proposed Amendment to Form U-3A-2 Form U-3A-2, the statement by a holding company claiming exemption underrule 2(a)(1) from all provisions of the Act except section 9(a)(2), wouldbe amended to solicit information that would enable a determination thata rule 2 claim by an intrastate holding company was meritorious in viewof the requirement added to rule 2. <ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments </ITAG>The Commission requests public comment on proposed rule 17, proposed amendedrule 2, and proposed amended form U-3A-2. Specific comment is invited on:(1) The available empirical evidence with respect to the benefits and/ordetriments of diversification into unrelated non-utility businesses bypublic-utility holding companies; (2) whether the conditions of the safeharbors in proposed rule 17 are appropriate, whether more restrictive conditionsare needed, or whether less restrictive conditions would be adequate. Inparticular, the Commission invites comment on whether the consolidatedasset test and the percentage limitations, in paragraph (a)(1)(iv), whichderive from the Commission's opinions in <T3>Pacific Lighting Corp., </T3>are appropriate, or whether some othertest, for example the approximately 25% of holding-company-assets testin Wisconsin's holding company statute, which makes no distinction betweendiversification which is related and unrelated to utility operations, wouldbe an appropriate standard; and (3) whether other measures (e.g., grossassets, total revenues, net income, shareholder equity, etc.) would bemore appropriate. If you suggest other measures, please include relatedpercentage figures that you recommend, and the basis therefor. Pacific Enterprises (formerly Pacific Lighting Corporation) (``Pacific'')and a subcommittee of the American Bar Association (``ABA'') have submittedproposals, dated July 11 and July 14, 1988, respectively, concerning diversificationby exempt holding companies. Pacific suggests that the Commission issue a statement of administrativepolicy regarding exempt holding company diversification (``Policy Statement'').Under the Policy Statement:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Diversification would not, in and of itself, be deemed detrimentalto protected interests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Diversification would be first and foremost a matter for state regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A comprehensive state holding company statute should not be the onlymeans by which states can adequately protect the interests the Act is intendedto protect. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Five non-exclusive factors (concerning operational and functionaldealings between utility subsidiaries and the holding company and non-utilitysubsidiaries) would be listed for diversifying exempted holding companiesto consider, these being factors the Commission would consider importantin determining whether diversification is conducted in a manner that maybe detrimental to protected interests.</ITAG>The ABA's proposed Interpretive Release would create presumptions as tosituations, on account of diversification, when the Commission would notchallenge exemptions, and when it might do so, in its discretion. Underthe Interpretive Release:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Diversification would not affect an exemption if a state regulatorwith jurisdiction over utility rates and services has (1) approved or sanctioneddiversification by formal decision or statement of general policy; (2)informed the Commission that the holding company diversificaticn programis consistent with local laws and no substantial. detriment to protectedinterests is perceived; or (3) in a proceeding involving a utility subsidiaryof the holding company, in which any material question involving or arisingout of diversification was specifically in issue, made no finding thatdiversification in and of itself is detrimental to protected interests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Diversification could cause the initiation of formal proceedingsby the Commission in exceptional circumstances, such as when (1) a stateregulator has determined that the diversification has a continuing materialadverse effect on rates and services; (2) the state regulator, or others,have for good cause petitioned the Commission to initiate a proceedingunder the ``unless and except'' clause to determine if the exemption isdetrimental to prctected interests; or (3) the Commission's staff has determinedthat there is imminent danger of substantial harm to a utility subsidiaryof the exempt holding company by reason of diversification.</ITAG>These submissions, which differ in form and substance from the Commission'srulemaking proposal, have been placed in the public comment file on theCommission's proposal and are available for inspection. While these submissionsare not proposed as alternatives to the proposed Commission rule set forthbelow, the Commission invites comment on whether some or all of the provisionsof these proposals should supplement or supplant the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="85">Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis(``Analysis'') in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding the proposal ofrule 17 and the proposed amendments to rule 2 and form U-3A-2. The Analysisexplains that proposed rule 17 would specify certain circumstances, onand after three years from adoption, in which non-utility diversificationby an intrastate public-utility holding company would not be deemed detrimentalto the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers. By creatingsafe harbors, the proposed rule is intended to provide intrastate public-utilityholding companies with greater certainty in determining the circumstancesunder which, because of diversified activities, exemptive orders wouldbe entered or, having been granted, continued. The proposed amendment torule 2, on and after three years from its adoption, would require thata claim of exemption under that rule by an intrastate holding company,in order to be effective, would require such holding company to meet oneof the safe harbor provisions of rule 17. The proposed amendment to formU-3A-2 would require intrastate holding companies claiming exemption underrule 2 to furnish information supporting the company's ability to relyon one of the safe harbor provisions of rule 17. In passing the Act, Congressincluded in section 3(a)(1) a broad exemption for intrastate public-utilityholding companies. The exemption apparently stemmed from Congress' beliefthat for such companies state regulation would provide sufficient publicprotection to obviate the need for additional federal regulation. Congressdid not, however, shield such companies entirely from federal regulatoryoversight; section 3(a)(1) requires the Commission to grant exemptionsto intrastate holding companies ``unless and except'' as the Commissionfinds the exemption detrimental to protected interests. The Analysis statesthat substantial diversification activities by some intrastate holdingcompanies have brought to the fore the need for the Commission to clarifythe standards for determining when such activities jeopardize exemptionsfrom the Act. The Analysis notes that presently only one exempt intrastatepublic-utility holding company, out of a total of 122, is a small entityas defined by the Commission's rules. The Analysis also states that theCommission believes that additional reporting or recordkeeping requirementsimposed by the proposals call for information that is readily availableand can be assembled with no significant increase in cost to any intrastateholding company. The proposals could significantly impact a small entitythat intended to diversify and rely on one of the safe harbors by possiblycausing such a holding company to limit its acquisition of unrelated non-utilityinterests as might be required by the ``regulatory'' safe harbor, or asmight be required by a ``state'' safe harbor, depending on its requirements.The Analysis notes that the Commission has considered certain significantalternatives, including requiring fewer or less burdensome conditions tobe satisfied for a safe harbor to be available to a small entity. The Analysisstates, however, that the Commission believes that such an alternativewould be inconsistent with the legislative intent of section 3(a). Withrespect to the reporting provisions the proposals would add, the Analysisstates that the Commission believes that an exemption from all or partof those provisions for small entities is not appropriate in view of theminimal compliance costs involved and the need by the Commission of theinformation to evaluate entitlement to a safe harbor.

Cimmet, Esq., Mail Stop 7-1, Securitiesand Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. <ITAG tagnum="84">Cost Benefit of Proposal </ITAG>The proposed rule, rule amendment, and form amendment (``the proposals'')could significantly increase regulatory compliance costs for those intrastatepublic-utility holding companies that have substantially diversified, orintend to substantially diversify into non-utility businesses unrelatedto their utility operations. The proposals could require an intrastateholding company that seeks an exemption, or that seeks to preserve an existingexemption, to (1) forgo an acquisition of an unrelated non-utility interestor to divest itself of such interests previously acquired; or alternatively,(2) seek enactment by the legislature in its state of organization of aregulatory structure meeting the requirements of the ``state'' safe harborset forth in paragraph (a)(2) of rule 17. Hcwever, the consequence of anintrastate holding company having to tailor diversification activitiesto come within a ``regulatory'' safe harbor, or a ``state'' safe harborwhere one exists, to ensure the availability or continuation of exemptstatus, carries out the Commission's mandate to delimit detriment to protectedinterests that could result from diversification by intrastate holdingcompanies into businesses bearing no relationship to the economy and managementof utility operations. Where the states do not act, the federal standard embodied in the ``regulatory''safe harbor is intended to delimit detriment that could stem from diversification.However, where the relevant state has made a judgment that holding companysystem diversification would not conflict with its ability to exerciseregulatory control over utility services, and that control flows from astate public-utility holding company statute, the Commission would permiteffectuation of Congress' apparent view that an intrastate holding companycould be effectively controlled by its state of organization. The Commission invites specific comments as to its assessments of the costsand benefits associated with the proposals, in addition to estimates ofany costs and benefits perceived by commenters.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Basis and Text of Amendments</ITAG>Rule 17 and the amendments to rule 2(a)(1) and form U-3A-2 are being proposedpursuant to the authority set forth in sections 3(a)(1) and 20(a) of thePublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 17 CFR Parts 250 and 259</ITAG>Accounting, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities, Utilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Text of Proposed Rule, Rule Amendment, and Form Amendment</ITAG>Chapter II of Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed tobe amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 250_RULES AND REGULATIONS, PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACTOF 1935</ITAG>1.
