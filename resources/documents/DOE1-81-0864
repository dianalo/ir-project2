One of these responses is the change of repair capacity of DNAdamages induced by UV light irradiation. In the present work they haveinvestigated the possible relations between poly/adenoribosyl/synthetase(PAR) activity, UV endonuclease activity and alteration of the compositionof dNTP pool. PAR synthetase activity changed parallel to induced DNArepair activity resulting in a correlation coefficient of R = 0.82 betweenthe two parameters. There was no significant relationship between thechange of endonucleases activity and induction of DNA repair. Inductionof DNA repair by methyl methanesulfonate was different in the functionof deoxypurine and deoxypyrimidine pools, respectively. Change of DNArepair described saturation curves in the function of dATP and dGTP concentrationsof spleen lymphocytes and produced cubic curves in the function of dTTPand dCTP content, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
