Financial markets were shocked by the news of the first rate hikesince a full-point increase on Aug. 25 and of the unexpectedly largetrade shortfall of 2.93 billion pounds, or about $5.4 billion.   Share prices plunged on the London Stock Exchange, with theFinancial Times 100-share index falling as much as 50.5 pointsbefore recovering somewhat. The index finished 38.3 points, or 2.1percent, lower at 1,794.7.   The pound also plummeted on the trade news, but the interest rateincrease pushed it back up. It was quoted at $1.8435 in latetrading, up from $1.8375 late Thursday.   The developments raised new questions about the effectiveness ofPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher's policy of fighting inflation _her No. 1 economic priority _ by discouraging consumption withhigher interest rates.   But Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the interestrate hike was ``a clear indication that this government is notprepared to take any risks with inflation.''   The government has pushed up interest rates by a total of 5.5percentage points since June. But the annual inflation rate stillhas risen to 6.4 percent from 3.3 percent in January, partly becausethe rate hikes have meant higher mortgage rates.   The poor trade figures for October confirmed that consumptionhasn't slowed: car imports were up 10 percent, for example. But theDepartment of Trade and Industry partly blamed the figures onerratic items as well as distortions caused by a mail strike inSeptember.   Lawson, speaking to a group of businessmen in Birmingham, said hewould prefer to average September's good figures and October's``freak'' result.   ``Having said that, it is perfectly clear that we have gotimports still rising strongly,'' he added. ``Although the earlierrises in interest rates have been undoubtedly having an effect,which you can see in the housing market for example, interest ratesdo take time to have their full effect.''   Chris Anthony, an economist at the London brokerage firm ofPhillips and Drew Ltd., said the October trade report was ``a clearindication that the government's policies haven't begun to work onthe trade front. There is still no clear sign of a downturn inconsumption.''   David Smith, economist at the brokers William de Broe HillChaplin and Co., said: ``Consumption hasn't appeared to be thatinterest-rate sensitive.''   Some economists said interest rates had to go still higher.   But opposition legislator Bryan Gould, who serves as the LaborParty's spokesman on trade issues, said Lawson's strategy wascausing ``great damage'' to British industry.   A half-hour after the Department of Trade and Industry reportedat 11:30 a.m local time that exports fell 10 percent as importssurged 12 percent in October, the Bank of England, by raising itsmoney-market lending rate, signalled commercial banks to increasetheir 12 percent base lending rate to 13 percent. That is the keyrate's highest level since April 1985.   Britain's four leading commercial banks _ Barclays Bank PLC,National Westminster Bank PLC, Lloyds Banks PLC and Midland Bank PLC_ quickly raised their lending rates to 13 percent.   Commercial borrowers can get loans at 1 percentage point abovethe base lending rate.</TEXT></DOC>
