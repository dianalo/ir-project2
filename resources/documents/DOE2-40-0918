The findings indicated thatdifferent types of dust generated different biological responses. Theeffects of various foreign materials adhering to dust particles werealso explored. An analysis of the uptake of polycyclic hydrocarbons onvarious types of asbestos fibers and their release in conjunction withthe proliferative effect on the respiratory epithelium was one such researchproject. Studies demonstrated the importance of the zeta potential indetermining cytotoxicity. The role of naturally occurring substancesin altering the interaction of these particulates with the epithelialcells was discovered.</TEXT></DOC>
