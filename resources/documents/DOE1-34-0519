This system involvesthe use of the letter T with appropriate numerals and letters to describethe size of the primary lesion. The letters N and M with appropriatesubscripts indicate the presence or absence of regional lymph node metastasesand metastases to distant sites, respectively. This system is based onthe premise that cancers of similar histology or site of original sharesimilar patterns of growth and dissemination. While both organ of originand histologic classification of a tumor can provide information of someprognostic importance, this information generally lacks sufficient precisionfor determining the prognosis for a given patient with most common solidtumors. Therefore it has become a basic principle in the evaluation ofpatients with cancer that the extent of tumor dissemination is the mostsignificant factor determining prognosis. Perhaps this is most readilydemonstrated in reviewing the impact of postsurgical pathologic stagingof squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.</TEXT></DOC>
