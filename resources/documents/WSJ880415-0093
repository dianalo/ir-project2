In a letter to Secretary of State George Shultz, the lawmakers urged the administration to &quot;reconsider any new arms sales&quot; to the Saudis because of the kingdom's purchase of intermediate-range East Wind missiles from China, a move the senators called a &quot;tremendous threat to regional security.&quot;    Enough senators signed the letter to defeat a request for the sale that the administration earlier this year told Congress it would make.    The move by lawmakers is a means of pressuring the administration into examining the intelligence failure that resulted in the U.S. not knowing that a close ally was obtaining Chinese weapons until after they were delivered last year.    It is understood that Mr. Shultz asked Saudi officials during his recent Mideast trip for detailed information about the missiles but was rebuffed. Israeli officials say they are concerned because the missile, which has a range of as much as 1,600 miles, is capable of carrying nuclear or chemical warheads. Saudi officials reportedly have told the U.S. that the weapons don't have nuclear warheads, but it isn't known whether similar assurances have been made about chemical warheads.    Last year, Congress forced the administration to drop a proposal to sell Saudi Arabia Maverick ground missiles. The weapons were part of a $1.4 billion weapons package that also included F-15 fighter aircraft earmarked to replace similar airplanes previously sold to the kingdom. </TEXT></DOC>
