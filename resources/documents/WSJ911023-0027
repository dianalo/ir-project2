Although computer checking of personal returns againstpayers' Form 1099 reports of dividends, interest, and thelike is highly productive, the IRS contends that a matchingprogram for company returns would face burdensomecomplications. The General Accounting Office disagrees. Itclaims that a program could produce $1 billion in added taxrevenue a year by 1995 at a cost of $70 million a year. Italso says the IRS underestimates the benefits of a programand overstates the costs to companies.</LP><TEXT>   Now the GAO advises Congress to require reporting ofpayments to corporations, but to phase in the process. Theplan: Give payers and the IRS a few years to prepare systems,then have all payers report only certain payments -- perhapsinterest, dividends, and rents. After the process gets going,other kinds of payments could be added. The GAO suggests thatmatching could begin with small companies -- the leastcompliant ones -- and extend to larger ones later.   The GAO also advises Congress to earmark IRS fundsspecifically for the corporate matching program.                                                                                                          A BADLY PLANNED WILL blocks an estate from deductingcharitable gifts.   To be deductible, a charitable bequest's value must beascertainable at the time of death. The late Dr. David N.Marine of Oxford, Md., wanted to leave most of his estate toJohns Hopkins and Princeton universities. He also wanted toreward certain people who cared for him to the end of hislife; so his will empowered two friends to name -- after hisdeath -- an unlimited number of beneficiaries for limitedamounts, with the remainder to go to the universities.   The friends made two awards totaling $25,000; the schoolsgot $688,351 each. But the IRS denied the estate's charitabledeductions, and the Tax Court upheld the IRS. Because thewill didn't limit the number of the potential privatebequests, they could have consumed the whole estate, leavingnothing for charity, Judge Wells said, so the value of theresidue couldn't be determined at the time of Dr. Marine'sdeath.                                                                                                          THE EYES OF TEXAS were particularly attracted to thisproperty.   When the Texas Turnpike Authority condemned Grover Hope'sland for a tollway extension, he objected to the $600,000offer. Although Hope later settled for $2,250,000, he claimedthe land was actually worth $4 million. By accepting thelesser amount, he declared, he'd made a gift to the staterepresenting the difference. But the IRS disallowed thecharitable deduction, asserting he had been fullycompensated. The IRS disputed that the deal was a &quot;bargainsale&quot; in which a donor makes a gift by intentionally sellingproperty at less than market value.   Both parties asked the U.S. Claims Court for a summaryjudgment, and the IRS prevailed. Once he signed away theclaim, the court said, Hope had no &quot;excess value&quot; to transfervoluntarily. Moreover, it declared, &quot;condemnation proceduresshould not be forced to compete with the tax procedures forthe right to determine value in a condemnation case.&quot;   Tax lawyer Conrad Teitell, Old Greenwich, Conn., says adonor should make his intentions clear early on.                                                                                                          THE USER FEE for recreational boats would be repealed,more or less, next Oct. 1 under a House Ways and Means plan;but it would reappear in any year through 1995 when the lostrevenue wasn't offset by other income. Outraged by this&quot;half-baked&quot; provision, the Boat Owners Association of theU.S. calls for outright repeal.                                                                                                          ELDERLY RESIDENTS of an exempt care facility may deductdonations to it to build a walkway to a neighboring hospital,IRS private ruling 9141011 says. That's because the gifts arevoluntary and not in exchange for a substantial benefit andthe use of the walkway won't be limited to donors.                                                                                                          THE TOP CAREER OFFICER in the IRS, Michael J. Murphy, 54,will retire as deputy commissioner by March 1. He was actingcommissioner for four months in 1989. Murphy hasn't disclosedhis plans; the IRS has said nothing about a successor.                                                                                                          LET'S DROP THE TAX in taxidermy, Louisiana's officialhunter proposed.   Darwin A. Miller of Houma, who died in 1989, hunted theworld over for ibex, ibis, eider, and other beasts and birdsto shoot and have mounted in the hope of starting a statemuseum. Edwin Edwards, governor in 1972-80 and 1984-88, namedhim Louisiana's &quot;official big-game hunter&quot; and agreed toaccept gifts of wildlife trophies that Miller would keepuntil the state could fund a museum. No state officialaccepted gifts in 1981-83, but Miller took charitabledeductions of $2.4 million in 1981-85 for gathering andmaintaining hundreds of trophies.   The IRS denied the deductions, so Miller's estate turnedto the Tax Court. Now the court says the estate didn't proveany gifts were legally transferred and accepted in 1981-84.Only for 1985 was there documentation for completed gifts --and the deductible value of the gifts was just $71,000. Forall five years, Judge Ruwe denied, as unproved, anydeductions for maintenance.   Ruwe rejected claims that Miller acted both as donor andas Louisiana's official agent for accepting the gifts.                                                                                                          BRIEFS: The administration opposes for revenue and otherreasons a bill by Sen. Daschle (D., S.D.) that would offerspecial deductions to people who buy surplus agriculturalcommodities and donate them to hunger-relief organizations. .. . The U.S. agreement to exchange taxpayer information withHonduras has gone into effect.</TEXT></DOC>
