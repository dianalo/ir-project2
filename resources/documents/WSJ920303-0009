Medical insurance is among the most contentious issues inunion contract talks nationwide. In California, however,&quot;health care trust funds&quot; are helping to ease the frictionbetween school unions and management.   Ten trusts are now scattered across California, with atotal of about 50,000 members, about 10% of the state'sschool employees. Most are made up of several schooldistricts and range in size from 500 to 18,000 members.   The trust itself is a board of about 16 people dividedequally among representatives of labor and of management.Meeting monthly, a trust monitors its health plan and hammersout ways to contain costs. A session might touch on wellnessprograms, new contracts with doctors or hospitals, ormembers' individual concerns about benefits.   By tackling such issues monthly and by constantlyeducating each others' constituencies about the cost ofmedical care, management and labor have been able to curbquarrels and costs.   &quot;It used to take us anywhere from three weeks to sevenmonths to negotiate benefits,&quot; says Pam Marone, a laborrepresentative for the Bay Area Schools Insurance CooperativeTrust in San Jose. &quot;In the last two negotiations, we did itin an hour.&quot; Her management counterpart, Herb Wadley, adeputy school superintendent, notes that the trust has usedvarious managed-care options to cut its costs about 5% a yearfrom what it normally would have paid its insurers.   &quot;There's no reason,&quot; says Jeff Malek, a principal at NobleLowndes in San Francisco, a benefits consulting firm thatassists the trusts, &quot;why this can't be brought into theprivate sector.&quot;                                                                                                          Doctors Turn to Software   To Avoid Malpractice Suits                                                                                                          ONE ANSWER to the stifling cost of malpractice litigationmay lie in a new software package.   ADAM, which stands for Animated Dissection of Anatomy forMedicine, is made by Adam Software in Marietta, Ga. The$8,000 program, which its makers describe as a &quot;flightsimulator&quot; for physicians, allows users to dissect the bodyin exhaustive detail on a color screen. Wielding an animatedscalpel, physicians can perform surgery exactly as they wouldin an operating room.   Marketed primarily to medical schools, ADAM is being usedin physicians' offices to educate patients about their achesand pains and how best to treat them. That process, saysGregory Swayne, Adam's president, should go a long way towardgaining patients' &quot;informed consent,&quot; an understanding andapproval of what will take place in surgery.   He estimates that 70% of malpractice suits stem frominstances in which patients aren't familiar with proceduresor possible side effects. A major insurer, he adds, isconsidering discounts on malpractice premiums to doctors whouse ADAM.   Last year, Lester Dennis, a podiatrist in Brooklyn, N.Y.,bought part of the software, which costs from $5,000 to$8,000. Before surgery, he sits patients in front of hiscomputer, reviews the operation and even makes a printout thepatient can sign.   &quot;With an understanding of the procedure, there are fewerunreasonable expectations,&quot; he says. &quot;That could limitmalpractice.&quot;                                                                                                          National Health Care   Rankles Older Physicians                                                                                                          SAY GOODBYE: If national health care becomes a reality, alot of older doctors say they will stop going to work.   A study of physicians aged 55 and older by Merritt,Hawkins andamp; Associates, a search firm, found that 50% ofsurveyed doctors said they would retire immediately oraccelerate retirement if there's universal health care.   With 29% of U.S. physicians already 55 or older, such anexodus would seriously wound the nation's medical system,particularly in rural areas, says Joseph E. Hawkins, chiefexecutive of Merritt Hawkins, Irving, Texas.   &quot;The people who are proposing {national health care} andwho make the decisions aren't aware&quot; of the level ofdiscontent already present among doctors, or theirunwillingness to become, in effect, civil servants, he says.   Much of that discontent, according to the firm's survey,stems from the massive changes in medicine in the pastdecade. Almost 60% of the doctors surveyed said they andtheir staffs now devote 20 hours a week or more to paper workfor insurers and government regulators. For almost half ofthose surveyed, that figure was one to two hours in the earlyyears of practice.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          HOSPITAL CHAINS that went through leveraged buy-outs inthe 1980s were found to be more efficient and have lowercosts than other hospitals, according to a study by HealthCare Investment Analysts Inc. in Baltimore. The study, whichdidn't look at quality of care, found that the big debt loadscarried by the hospitals, as well as greater freedom amongmanagement in a non-public setting, prompted them to slashoverhead, reduce staff and shed unprofitable facilities morereadily than other hospitals. . . . Minority workers are lesslikely to be covered by health insurance. A study of 11,500workers by researchers at the University of Florida inGainesville found that almost half of the Hispanic employeessurveyed and 40% of blacks receive no health insurancethrough employers. That compares with 38% of white employees.Narrowing the group to eliminate workers who obtainedbenefits through a spouse, they found that almost 30% ofHispanics and 21% of blacks had no coverage. That compareswith 14% of whites.</TEXT></DOC>
