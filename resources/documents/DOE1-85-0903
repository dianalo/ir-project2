A few powder processed materials have also beenstudied. Significant improvements in high temperature compressive propertieson alloying have been related to increases in the DO3 - B2 transitiontemperature and the associated changes in the nature of the dislocationsinvolved in the deformation processes. 8 references.</TEXT></DOC>
