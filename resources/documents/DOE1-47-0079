This arrangement is now being dismantled, and has allowed exportsince 1983, with modest free-market sales since 1985. Much of the exportedcrude is currently from older, established fields, but with a numberof new fields that have come into production recently, some of the newerstreams are beginning to find their way to many distant parts of therefining world. There are five important Australian crude oils eithernow being, or likely to be, exported: Barrow Island and Gippsland crudes,which are produced from fields discovered in 1960s; and Jabiru, Jacksonblend, and Northwest Shelf condensate, all coming to production duringthe last 5 years. This article discusses each of these oils.</TEXT></DOC>
