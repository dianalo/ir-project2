(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Students at the National Fire Academysometimes are given a field assignment: Find as many fire codeviolations as you can at the nation's top fire safety trainingcenter.   There are 180.   Embarrassed federal fire officials hope federal budget-cuttersthis year don't ax the $4.6 million needed to comply with theMaryland state fire code. The money was part of a $78 billionspending package passed Tuesday by an appropriations conferencecommittee.   The center has corrected minor fire code violations in the pastfew years, but now needs $4.6 million to make structural changes tobuildings that have failed inspections by the state fire marshal'soffice.   The state last inspected the campus April 27 and plans to returnNov. 4.   ``Not all of those 180 violations are consideredlife-threatening, but they do have a few that are serious,'' DeputyState Fire Marshal Bob Thomas said Tuesday.   Inadequate exits in the campus dining hall and auditorium arethe two most urgent problems, he said.   ``This is our national fire station, and we need to make sure itis fit for duty,'' said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairman ofthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Veteran's Administration,Department of Housing and Urban Development and IndependentAgencies.   The fire academy's money still must pass floor votes in bothchambers and be signed by President Bush.   The fire academy, part of the National Emergency ManagementAgency, has been based on a quiet campus of old, red-brickbuildings in the Catoctin Mountains 70 miles northwest ofWashington since 1980.   Each year, thousands of career and volunteer firefighters attendtraining sessions to learn the latest in fire prevention and firedepartment management.</TEXT></DOC>
