Marchers from the movement's high time swayed and clapped togospel music. Movement royalty _ King's widow, sister and three ofhis children _ were on hand for festivities that lasted untilmidnight.   But one person was noticeably absent: Dexter Scott King.   He called himself ``the son of a son of a movement'' when hebecame president of his father's memorial center, but left thecenter in a huff four months later amid a reported power strugglewith his mother, Coretta Scott King.   King, 28, the youngest son, has kept a low profile since hisresignation Aug. 4 from the Martin Luther King Jr. Center forNonviolent Social Change. Neigher he nor his mother responded torepeated requests for interviews.   The King Center's directors emerged from a six-hour meetingWednesday with a new job for King, but they have not announced whatit is. King has given no indication whether he will accept the job.   The directors have said the center's presidency will remainvacant and they consider the matter basically resolved.   As the Southern Christian Leadership Conference convened herelast week, there were several who identified with Dexter King'sposition: that of a young leader who wants his ideas heard in amovement where the old guard is reluctant to surrender control.   Among them was U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a leader in theStudent Non-Violent Coordinating Committee during the 1960s. Lewis,49, said such power struggles were a problem nearly 30 years ago.   ``The sit-ins and the Freedom Rides in SNCC were also a revoltagainst the old leadership,'' he said. ``What made it different inthat period was we had been provided a role, and a place at thetable.   ``You cannot take the dream ... to participate, put it in abottle and put a cap on it. We should open the doors, make youngpeople feel welcome.''   ``One thing about Martin Luther King Jr. _ he welcomed theinvolvement of young people,'' Lewis said. ``He praised the vigorthey could bring to a struggle.''   Civil rights leaders, many of whom have acted as surrogatefathers to King's children, said they are concerned about DexterKing's welfare.   ``I do plan to talk to him,'' said SCLC President Joseph Lowery,a member of the King Center's board of directors and a longtime Kingfamily friend. ``I think some mistakes were made on both sides.   ``I think he's amenable to working it out. He loves the centerand I'm sure he wants to be involved in the vital work the centerdoes.''   But another King aide, Hosea Williams, said, ``He ain't goingback in there.'' Williams said King left because the center'sleaders, by giving him the role of ``president-in-training,'' showedthey were unwilling to give him power to change things.   ``They killed the boy's spirit. He sees now how costly it is, howtough it is to be a true leader,'' Williams said.   ``They talking about training. What kind of training does heneed?'' Williams asked. ``Old age is the inability to accept change.And that is just the problem that Dexter ran into.''   The Rev. Tony Minor, 30, could readily identify with what DexterKing experienced.   Minor, the SCLC's youngest chapter president, pulled together aconference chapter in Cleveland, Ohio, that, after eight months, has150 members _ mostly people under 35.   A graduate of Martin Luther King's alma mater, Morehouse College,Minor spent five years as an aide for Lowery and Atlanta MayorAndrew Young, learning how to move his ministry into the communityand listening to stories about the movement days.   Minor said the SCLC has made room at the top for youth before,and he doesn't mind waiting for his day in the sun.   ``The challenge is for younger leaders to respect and supportveterans who have been around,'' he said. ``Those veterans should,in turn, adopt the young leaders, teach them, support them.''   But Williams said, ``Young leaders must not back up or submit toold leaders like me.''   ``They've just got to come up and push old leaders on out of theway,'' he said. ``Old leaders must realize ... we should voluntarilyallow the young leaders to take over and meet today's challenge.   ``If we don't do that, then what we have suffered for willperish.''</TEXT></DOC>
