Thailand's ambassador to Laos, Niran Panupong, said both sideshave different interpretations of the treaty between his countryand what was then French-ruled Laos.   In addition, Thongsi Intapon, a Laotian official of the PrimeMinister's Office, said Laos first wanted to define the role andduties of a joint border committee proposed by the Thais beforesuch a body is formed.   ``If we commit ourselves to that committee now, we will findourselves arguing in the jungles,'' Thongsi told reportersaccompanying the 15-member Thai delegation to the talks.   The Thais want an agreement defining the location of the borderin the disputed wedge of hills between Thailand's northernPhitsanulok province and Laos' Sayaboury province.   Top Thai army officials have said 147 Thai soldiers and 402Laotian troops died before the two sides began a truce and pledgedto enter into peace talks Feb. 19.   The Thais say they will take the dispute to the World Court if abilateral agreement is not reached. But Thongsi said such a movewould be ``a last resort and not necessary.''   He said the prime ministers of both countries want a speedyagreement but added the talks could take ``quite a while'' if theatmosphere at Friday's meeting persisted.   The 1,030-mile border is poorly defined, and a similarterritorial dispute over three border villages led to battles in1984.</TEXT></DOC>
