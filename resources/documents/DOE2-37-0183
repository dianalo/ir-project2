Unitoperations include: Charging and discharging of liquid nitrogen, He gasreplacement, Dewar pressurization and transfer of liquid He, check ofsubmerging, and valve operation. Insufficient purging of nitrogen resultsin wasteful consumption of liquid He and impaired performance of He gaspurification unit. The electromagnetic valve for liquid He with vacuumadiabatic structure was developed and automated. A protective actionwas incorporated in the quenching and pouring interruption for the safety.The system was tested with a 15.5 Tesla superconducting magnet. Consumptionof liquid nitrogen was 60 liters from the start of preliminary coolingto immersion. About 60 liters of liquid He was consumed, including evaporation,from the pouring of liquid He to immersion. The preliminary cooling withliquid nitrogen has reduced the He consumption to only 1/3 and made theprocess less costly. Operators are do not have to carry out long andcomplicated cooling work due to this new automated system. (3 figs, 7refs)</TEXT></DOC>
