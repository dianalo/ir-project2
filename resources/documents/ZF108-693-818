 When communications must beestablished in a certain area, a network configuration must be designed thatwill accommodate both fixed- and mobile-communications users quickly.andP;  Only avery limited set of automated tools exists to aid in this planning, which isextremely time-consuming.andM;Additionally, this equipment must be allocated efficiently and effectively.andO;In a typical configuration, each 23,300 square-mile area will have more than350 pieces of equipment and about 10,000 users.andP;  The primary types ofequipment to be configured are:andM;* Node centers: switching centers linked into a backbone communicationsnetworkandM;* Extension nodes: local switching centers that support fixed usersandM;* Mobile switching centers: trucks with antennas that support mobile usersandM;* Mobile radios: similar to commercial cellular telephones.andM;Two interesting AI problems surfaced while designing a mobile communicationsnetwork.andP;  The first one is a constraint-satisfaction problem because theplanner must balance many variables and restrictions on equipmentconnectivity.andP;  For this problem, constraint-directed search techniques wereemployed to design a network configuration in near-real time.andP;  The secondproblem involved calculating radio-signal propagation emitted from a mobileswitching center.andP;  The objective was to find the best spots for signalpropagation, but because these calculations are extremely time-consuming ancomplex, heuristic approximation of a ed engineering models was used toestimate the propagation for potential locations.andM;MAJOR TASKSandM;The first task in designing the network is to allocate extension nodes.andO;Large and small extension nodes service fixed, or stationary, users.andP;  Thelocation and number of these users dictates the placement of the extensionnodes.andP;  Since locations are predetermined, the assignment of the extensionnodes is straightforward.andM;The second task is to locate the mobile switching centers that service mobileusers by emitting an omnidirectional signal from their antennas.andP;  A graphictool was built that allows users to &quot;paint&quot; the areas of requiredcommunications coverage for mobile users since the planner often wants toconcentrate equipment assets in critical areas.andP;  In addition, users canspecify degrees of required coverage along a three-point scale.andP;  Althoughusers can choose areas for communications coverage, potential mobileswitching-center locations cannot be confined exclusively to these areas; alarger area must be examined for possible locations since a good site couldfall outside the requested coverage area.andP;  Unfortunately, no highly effectiveway exists to prune the search space of locations although mobile usercoverage may only be necessary in certain areas.andP;  The most obvious (butlimited) technique is to exclude locations where the transmission range ofthe equipment would not reach the desired coverage area.andM;The third task involves clustering equipment into small groups for attachmentto a node center.andP;  Node centers serve as switching centers and provide entryinto the communications network.andP;  Clustering the equipment reduces the searchspace of possible node center locations.andP;  Once a cluster is formed, alocation is hypothesized for the node center that attempts to maximize theline of sight, or direct path, connections to other equipment.andP;  If all theline-of-sight constraints cannot be satisfied, a location is suggested wherethe greatest number of constraints have been met.andM;The last task is to connect the node centers into a backbone communicationsnetwork.andP;  Line-of-sight constraints must be observed and network redundancyprovided in case of failure at a single node (Figure 1).andM;CONSTRAINT REASONINGandM;The network design challenge involves devising an effective spatialconfiguration of mobile network equipment to support communications needsadequately in situations of many variables and constraints.andP;  Equipmentcharacteristics, terrain features, and the projected locations ofcommunications users must be considered.andP;  Some examples of the constraints onthis design process are:andM;* All fixed users must be supportedandM;* Radio coverage should be maximized where mobile users are concentratedandM;* Line-of-sight links between mobile network equipment should be maximizedandM;* Network vulnerability should be minimized by providing adequateconnectivity between node centers (but complete connectivity isn't practical)andM;* Range restrictions for each type of equipment must be observed.andM;The complexity of this situation can be illustrated by dividing the designconsiderations into continuous decision variables, binary decision variables,and constraints.andP;  Continuous decision variables correspond to the placementof all equipment; the variables are continuous because the equipment could beplaced at any location in a wide geographic area.andP;  Binary decision variablescorrespond to the line-of-sight links.andP;  The variables are binary becauselinks between pieces of equipment either do or do not exist.andP;  Constraintsexist because equipment must be placed within cable range of its fixed user,each piece of equipment must be connected to at least one node center, andnode centers must be placed within ranges of the equipment they support.andP;  Inaddition, node centers must form a complete backbone network and be placedwithin range of other node centers.andM;A mathematical analysis based on this formulation demonstrates thatapproximately 400 continuous decision variables, 900 binary decisionvariables, and 1,100 constraints are possible.andP;  While certain algorithmictechniques are designed to search for solutions to this problem, finding asolution was expected to be time-consuming.andP;  Furthermore, the need to expressall the variables and constraints in mathematical terms makes it difficult toaccount for subjective judgments.andP;  Users may want to add or alter constraintsbased on their preferences.andM;Three approaches to this constraint-satisfaction problem were used:andM;* Divide the problem into loosely coupled subproblemsandM;* Work on the most constrained part of the problem firstandM;* Relax the elasticity of the lowest ranking constraints.andM;In the first approach, the global problem was partitioned into looselycoupled sub-problems.(1) This approach localizes the constraints so that theyneedn't be considered simultaneously.andP;  The technique of structuring theconstraints and variables into a series of smaller, more tractable, problemsis commonly used to reduce the complexity of many design processes.(2)Because the problem has been partitioned, the number of constraints that mustbe handled at any one time is bounded sufficiently to find a solutionquickly.andM;The next technique entailed identifying the most restrictive constraints.andO;The placement of extension nodes was chosen as the most constrained becausenode locations are dictated completely by the location of fixed users.andO;Essentially, they must be co-located with these users, and the only factorconsidered in their placement is the number of users they can support.andP;  Anappropriate number of extension nodes is assigned to service the amount offixed users.andP;  Because there is virtually no flexibility in the placement ofthese extension nodes, initial handling of this task bounds the rest of theproblem.andP;  The subproblems identified in the first step are ordered so thatthe most tightly constrained subproblems and independent constraints arehandled first and the dependent constraints last.(1,3) Figure 2 shows thesesubproblems and their interdependencies.andM;Finally, constraint-relaxation approaches were identified for the lowestranking, or least rigid, constraints.andP;  In this case, the elasticity of theline-of-sight restriction for all equipment attached to the node centers wasmanipulated to derive a solution.andP;  This constraint was relaxed from a &quot;hard&quot;constraint to a flexible one.andP;  Attempts were made to maximize line-of-sightconstraints at each stage of the design process, but when it was impossibleto achieve line-of-sight in all cases, relays were used.andP;  (A limited numberof relays are permitted.)andM;The elasticity of this constraint contributed greatly to a timely solution.andO;Had the lineof-sight restriction not been relaxed, the system may have beenforced to reconfigure equipment repeatedly, in turn causing dislocation ofother equipment and disrupting the constraint satisfaction achieved atearlier stages.andP;  This disruption would have required global backtrackingtechniques to avoid redesign.andM;By increasing the elasticity of selected constraints, a search problem wasformulated that could produce a satisfactory solution.andP;  This architecture hasbeen effective for providing an initial, feasible network design.andP;  However,the degree of global backtracking that would be required to produce a designwith less relays  always a desirable goal) is still unclear.andM;APPROXIMATING MATH MODELSandM;The second interesting AI problem involves the heuristic approximation ofengineering models for radio-signal propagation.andP;  A mobile switching centerhas an omnidirectional antenna whose signal must reach a potential user'smobile telephone for successful communications.andP;  However, the radio signalemanating from the switching center is affected by the type of terrain overwhich it travels.andP;  The locations for switching centers must be based on thebest spots for radiosignal reception.andP;  But because signal propagation isinfluenced by many physical and transient factors (such as atmosphericconditions) predicting precisely what the propagation will be in any givenarea is difficult.andP;  Terrain characteristics and adherence to the constraintsrelevant to switching-center placement must be considered when selectingmobile switching-center locations.andM;The area of radio coverage, or signal propagation, provided by a mobileswitching center is called a  &quot;footprint.&quot; Signal propagation can have twotypes of signal loss: free space and obstruction.andP;  Free-space loss is due totraveling through air from a transmitter to a receiver assuming no particularobstruction in its path; a well-defined, simple equation will predict thistype of loss.andP;  Obstruction loss is less well-defined; it comprises loss dueto factors such as vegetation, hills, and buildings.andP;  As a radio wavetravels, it may be impeded by something in its path and diffract (bend)around an object, causing some signal loss.andP;  As long as the sum of free-spaceand obstruction loss falls below a certain threshold, the radio signal willbe strong enough for a receiver to detect.andP;  But when the loss exceeds thatthreshold, receivers in the area will not be able to communicate with thetransmitter.andM;A large body of mathematical knowledge can be used to calculatesignal-propagation loss over terrain.andP;  Included in these statistical methodsis work by P. L. Longley and A. G. Rice in 1967 called the Longley-RiceAlgorithm for Tropospheric Radio Propagation.(4)  The algorithm has beentranslated into a computer model implemented in Fortran by the Institute forTelecommunications Sciences in Boulder, Colo.andP;  The model is considered to bea representative, popular signal-propagation algorithm.andM;The Longley-Rice method requires elevation data at equally spaced intervalsalong some given terrain path.andP;  It analyzes the proposed propagation path,particularly with respect to diffraction, and uses an empirical database toweigh different kinds of propagation losses.andP;  The analysis of the propagationpath is rigorous, considering such factors as the roughness of the terrain,slope and height distribution of obstructing terrain, atmospheric scatter ofthe radio wave, ground conductivity, climate, and terrain-elevation angles.andM;However, two problems emerge when attempting to use a statistical model.andO;First, no complete theoretical model of signal propagation exists.andP;  For thisreason, several algorithms (including Longley-Rice) use empirical data basedon terrain measurements representative of particular terrain types (forexample, signal loss might be measured over terrain consisting primarily ofrolling plains).andP;  These measurements are used to supplement the model where acomplete theoretical foundation is lacking.andP;  Each mathematical model also hasits limitations: the Longley-Rice model does not include loss due tovegetation and some models work well only for certain types of terrain.andM;The second limitation of the statistical approach is its heavy computationalburden.andP;  While these algorithms are suitable for small-scale scenarios inwhich only several transmitter and receiver locations are examined at any onetime, the need to examine many locations in near-real time precludessubstantial algorithmic calculation.andP;  Furthermore, a good, quickapproximation of the radio coverage for an area is far more useful to thecommunications planner than a perfected result that may take days to design.andM;ESTIMATING SIGNAL PROPAGATIONandM;Rather than employ a statistical model of signal propagation our approach wasto develop a heuristic approximation of the statistical models.andP;  In additionto the time required to compute the math for a large geographic area, noeffective methods to constrain the search space for mobile switching-centerlocations are available.andP;  Consequently, heuristics that analyze the possiblepropagation paths were used to limit the time required to perform thecalculations; more sophisticated spatial reasoning would allow this burden tobe reduced further.andP;  For example, valleys (typically poor signal-propagationsites) could be excluded from consideration.andM;A hexagon terrain data representation is used to reason about signal lossover terrain.andP;  The terrain is discretized into a field of hexagons, andwithin each hexagon terrain features are assumed to be homogeneous.andP;  Each2.22-mile interval is described by a single hexagon with fourcharacteristics: urbanization, forestation, roughness, and elevation.andP;  Eachof these terrain characteristics has four possible values to indicate thedegree of that characteristic.andP;  Each aspect of the terrain is examined alongthe path from a proposed transmitter location to the potential receivers inits range.andP;  A heuristically determined decibel loss per mile is assigned foreach terrain type.andP;  For example, a hexagon classified as &quot;heavily forested&quot;will have a 20-decibel loss per mile, while a forestation classification of&quot;open&quot; will have no loss factor at all.andP;  In this manner, the terrain profilefrom transmitter to receiver is analyzed to determine whether the radiosignal would be strong enough to reach the receiver.andM;The collection of hexagons that fall within the transmission area of anyparticular mobile switching center constitutes its footprint (Figure 3).andO;Areas with smooth, flat terrain will have a signal loss not much greater thanpure free space loss, while terrain with heavy vegetation will have a muchgreater loss.andP;  These loss calculations are precomputed for the entiregeographic area of interest.andP;  This one-time calculation is done deliberatelyto reduce interactive time during a planning session.andP;  Although the heuristicmethod of propagation loss is very fast compared to mathematical models, moresophisticated heuristics are being investigated to reduce computation time.andM;The key to the AI approach is the attempt to characterize a propagation pathin terms that will limit the computational burden compared to theconventional approach, which performs brute-force statistical calculations.andO;If, for example, a path can be identified as a line-of-sight one, signal-losscalculations are greatly minimized.andP;  The heuristic approach is clearly closerto the methods human planners employ as they attempt to use their knowledgeof the terrain and propagation-path types during map inspection.andM;The Longley-Rice model and the Bigfoot heuristic model were compared, asshown in Table 1.andP;  The Longley-Rice model in its original Fortran form wascompiled for use on a Symbolics workstation and then executed in place of theheuristics.andP;  While the comparison is slightly unfair since rewriting thealgorithm in LISP could have produced more efficient LISP code (compared toits compiler-generated counterpart), it provides some idea of the magnitudeof the difference.andM;Even if the algorithm's computation time were reduced by as much as half, itwould still not be feasible for an interactive activity.andP;  The algorithm wouldbe considered only for very special situations in which it clearly excelled(for example, complex diffraction paths consisting of multiple obstructions).andO;However, the benefits of such a hybrid approach are unclear.andP;  BecauseLongley-Rice doesn't model the complete set of factors affectingsignal-propagation loss, the system may still need to supplement the resultwith heuristically determined numbers for unincluded factors.andP;  Such a hybridapproach would only be contemplated in situations that illustrate  clearstrengths of the algorithm.andM;In summary, the heuristic model of propagation loss has several advantagesover its corresponding statistical models: it produces results that agreeapproximately with its mathematical counterparts (as shown in Table 2), andit is more appropriate for a near-real-time task due to its speed.andP;  Themagnitude of the problem and the need for a timely design clearly suggest theuse of heuristics.andP;  For a first-pass attempt at planning the communicationsnetwork, the precision of a statistical model is unnecessary, time-consuming,and will still never be exact.andP;  The mathematical precision provided bystatistical models is generally not worth the increased time it takes to findan answer.andM;HEURISTICS VS.andP;  MATH MODELSandM;Many of the principles that apply to the choice of heuristics overalgorithmic models for our domain can be generalized and are relevant toother domains.andP;  The advantages of mathematical approaches are welldocumented; they're extremely precise and have a strong theoretical backing.andO;Such approaches possess a clear set of assumptions and limitations-they seekto model the real world as closely as possible, deriving abstract principlesfrom concrete events.andP;  Because they reflect these principles, their theorycan be potentially applied to many domains, and results can often be verifiedagainst physical phenomena and are repeatable and predictable.andM;However, some disadvantages may make math models unsuitable for certaindomains.andP;  First, they tend to require excessive amounts of computation time.andO;Their formulations consist of complex equations that can only be interpretedby skilled mathematicians.andP;  Hence, they cannot be readily changed or easilyaltered to consider new data.andP;  These models are typically employed in thelaboratory to predict theoretical results but are often ignored in practicalsituations because that level of sophistication is unnecessary.andM;Classic algorithmic techniques search for an optimum solution; AI techniqueslook for a satisfactory solution.andP;  This approach is acceptable for manyreal-world problems because what constitutes the optimal solution is oftenunclear.andP;  Algorithmic models can also require input data that may not bereadily available.andP;  Lastly, introducing any subjective judgment into amathematical model is very difficult due to its very precise nature.andP;  Theheuristic approach also has its disadvantages.andP;  It is less precise thanalgorithmic models and more difficult to validate.andP;  However, the AI approachemulates the human's method of problem solving much more than the algorithmicone.andP;  The use of heuristics addresses the problem of computational complexityand solves tasks in real or near-real time.andP;  Some cases can be easilydismissed or quickly handled if they can be characterized at the outsetaccording to predetermined patterns-exactly what humans do to reduce thecomplexity of large problems to manageable proportions.andP;  Heuristics are alsoeasier to update as new knowledge is acquired and somewhat morestraightforward than their algorithmic counterparts.andP;  Subjective judgment canbe encoded in the knowledge base to account for special or sensitive cases.andM;Most importantly, the heuristic approach can often approximate the results ofmuch more precise models in a fraction of the time.andP;  In many situations wherea timely estimate is crucial, heuristic models offer an option wherealgorithmic models would not.andM;To gauge the appropriateness of heuristics for a domain, some key factorsshould be considered:andM;* How do people typically solve this problem? Are shortcuts used?andM;* Do some pieces of a task require less precision than others?andM;* Is some margin of error acceptable in a &quot;less precise&quot; result? Are resultsthat are not mathematically rigorous still useful, or will they be too coarseto yield any value?andM;* Are real-time, or near-real time, answers required?andM;* Does the problem need its computations limited in some way?andM;* Do existing algorithms model all the relevant variables?andM;* Do subjective considerations need to be accounted for?andM;* Is an absolute, validated answer possible? Because many problems need to besolved under both time and financial constraints, perfection is rarelyachieved in the real world.andP;  Without a reduction in the search space of manyproblems, humans would be unable to derive a satisfactory answer under theimposed constraints.andP;  Some bounding of the search is crucial for many typesof problem solving; otherwise, the process would be fraught with manyuseless, time-consuming attempts.andP;  But the ultimate justification foremploying heuristics lies in that they emulate the human decision-makingprocess.andM;PLANNED ENHANCEMENTSandM;Several areas were identified for future work; the first is an enhancementcalled terrain reasoning.andP;  This capability entails creating an abstractterrain representation above the hexagon level for aggregation into areasrepresenting physical entities such as roads and mountains.andP;  This featurewould lay the foundation for the capability to reason about real-worldobjects just as the human planner does and reduce the computational burden bygrouping contiguous hexagons into a single entity.andP;  The system could alsoreason about the logistics of moving equipment when recommended locations areremote and inaccessible.andM;Next, investigation of global backtracking techniques needs to be undertaken.andO;Users now can replan only at certain stages of the design process.andP;  However,methods for more flexible replanning (to &quot;undo&quot; pieces of the plan ifconstraint elasticity is manipulated) should be provided.andM;Both of these enhancements would give the system a more intelligent way ofhandling equipment placement and make it more compatible with an expert'splanning style.andP;  The ultimate goal, to use the same kind of intelligence thatthe human eye brings to the map when it embarks upon a planning session, isripe with interesting AI challenges.andM;Special thanks to Martha Farinacci for her valuable mathematical analysis,Pam Jordan for all her hard work and design/programming efforts, and theoriginal Bigfoot design/hacking team: David Vogel, Karl Keller, Rick Tucker,and, of course, Pam.andP;  REFERENCESandM;1.andP;  Fox, M., and S.
