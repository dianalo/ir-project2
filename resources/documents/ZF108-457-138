(portrait)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PTO's Inventive Ways With ImagingandM;On the banks of the Potomac lies the biggest paper factory of them all: theUnited States Government.andP;  Across the murky river on the Virginia side,resides one of Uncle Sam's oldest and biggest paper generations: the U.S.andO;Patent and Trademark Office (PTO).andP;  since the-time of Thomas Jefferson, thePTO has been rolling out reams upon reams of paper in service of the200-year-old patent process--a process that's been in desperate need ofinformation-processing help since the 1950s.andP;  That help now seems to be athand thanks to imaging technology that promises to revolutionize the PTO'sstorage and search operations.andM;This is a revolution that Jefferson himself would welcome.andP;  The PTO hopesthis technological revolution will yield a dramatic reduction of paper and amuch more streamlined patent process.andM;The paper-plagued PTO is currently home to 27 million documents.andP;  Most ofthose documents pertain to the 5 million U.S.andP;  patents, some of which dateback more than two centuries.andP;  Destined to add to this deluge are 15 millionforeign patents that will be incorporated into the imaging subsystem once itbecomes fully operational.andM;The text and imaging subsystems are part of the PTO's ambitious AutomatedPatent System (APS), an $800 million effort that has been in the works since1982.andP;  The project is now on a course toward its 2002 implementation date.andO;Helping set that steady course is Tom Giammo, the PTO's assistantcommissioner for information systems.andP;  In a recent interview, the 51-year-oldIS chief told DATAMATION about the PTO's requirements and the innovativemethods he's using to manage one of the world's most massive and inventiveimaging initiatives.andM;Q: What is the status of the text and imaging subsystems of the AutomatedPatent System?andM;A: The text subsystem currently contains the full text of U.S.andP;  patents backto 1970.andP;  We are continuing to deploy this subsystem, gradually installingmore workstations for our patent examiners.andP;  The earlier deficiencies withthese workstations have been corrected, and they are undergoing final testingright now to make sure that they deliver the degree of resolution and speedthat we require.andM;On the imaging side, we've improved the speed and performance of thesubsystem and given the patent examiners some additional capabilities.andP;  Wewill be deploying this subsystem slowly to accommodate the different workhabits of the examiners.andP;  Chemical searchers, for example, have to do a lotmore detailed reading than mechanical engineer searchers, who can rely on thedrawings a lot more.andP;  So we expect a different pattern of machine usage willemerge once we get the chemical engineer examiners on the imaging subsystem.andM;Q: How are you planning to convert the PTO's 5 million patents from paper toimage?andM;A: All 5 million patents will be on our imaging system within the next threeyears.andP;  We're already storing the ASCII code of the text from these patentson tape.andP;  Ultimately, we will have two copies of every patent image on thesystem.andP;  One copy, at a density of 300 dots per inch, will be on slow,high-density devices [HDDs].andP;  The other copy, at 150 dpi, will be stored onrapid access devices [RADs].andP;  This is where the system will look first for animage of a page requested by an examiner.andP;  We have almost attained that 150dpi resolution.andM;Q: Are the patent examiners who are on APS using it for text as well asimage?andM;A: There are currently 50 or so users on the system.andP;  They may use it fortext, but they must use it to retrieve images.andP;  One of the problems is thatwe don't have the full database up yet.andP;  On average, we estimate that only60% of their references--the things that they absolutely have to look at--areactually on the automated file.andP;  The other 40% is still on paper.andP;  Thematerial has already been scanned.andP;  Right now, we're in the process ofburning platters.andP;  In the production mode, we'll initially burn from the HDDsand then burn from them onto the RADs.andP;  We plan to have everything on theHDDs by September 1991.andP;  It will take us another year to get everything ontothe RADs.andM;Q: That database is set to expand further when the foreign patents are added.andO;How will this formidable task be accomplished?andM;A: Once we eliminate duplicates, there will be approximately 15 millionforeign patents that will be added to our system.andP;  We have arrangements withboth the European Patent Office and the Japanese Patent Office to exchangeimages of patents.andP;  We are already getting those images, and we arecompressing them on a page-by-page basis.andP;  Today, an examiner usually doesnot look at foreign patents.andP;  So once they are added to the database, we willessentially be giving patent examiners four times more information to lookat.andM;Q: How does the PTO propose to handle this increased workload?andM;A: You don't want the examiners to slow down.andP;  What you want is betterquality work from them.andP;  Therefore, you can't just throw the additionalinformation at them in the same way they've been dealing with paper.andP;  Youwant to filter it better so that they're seeing higher quality informationthat they can dispose of in the same amount of time.andP;  In order to do that wehave to give examiners better tools to win-now down the duplicates betweenU.S.andP;  and foreign patents.andP;  We also have to sharpen their ability to narrowthe search much more rapidly using computer tools.andM;We have to experiment with different methods because no one has workedmechanically with files like this before.andP;  Many schemes have been proposed onhow to do this, but they've never really been tested.andP;  No one has mechanicalaccess to images like we do.andP;  So we have to provide a vehicle that willenable our examiners to experiment with the various techniques that promiseto help them work smarter.andP;  And before we actually get the foreign patents upand on line, we want to make sure that these capabilities are there.andP;  It willprobably require us to write special software.andM;Q: How does the current cadre of users feel about the APS?andM;A: They've had a lukewarm reaction to the responsiveness of the system.andP;  Butwe believe that will be cured once the new workstation screens come in.andP;  Thealmost unanimous opinion is that the system is better than paper, and theysay they don't want to go back.andP;  In fact, they say that they'd like all oftheir files to be put on the system so that they could fully utilize it.andP;  Ourcurrent ojective is to have one workstation for three examiners.andP;  And,ultimately, we will have every examiner on the system.andM;Q: How many workstations does this effort ential, and what capabilities areyou looking for?andM;A: We expect that there will be 2,000 patent examiners by the time we finishinstalling in 1996.andP;  If we keep that 3:1 ratio, that translates into roughly700 workstations for the examiners.andP;  Another 200 workstations for the publicwill bring the total to approximately 1,000.andP;  The current requirement for theexaminer workstation is that the machine be able to flash one page per secondup on the screen.andP;  When you flash a page a second onto a screen, you'reexpecting an examiner to recognize the document if it's been seen before andto make some instantaneous determination whether it is or is not relevant.andO;Therefore, that image better be absolutely crystal sharp, stable and damnnear perfect--because an examiner has to be able to comfortably look at itfor a session that can stretch out four or five hours.andP;  So we will alwaysneed a cadre of very high-speed workstations because in a browsing-type ofsearch, examiners have to glance through an enormous amount of information.andM;Q: Will there be less intensive use of the workstation, which would mean thatthe PTO could resort to less powerful machines for some applications?andM;A: When examiners are only looking at a few patents and do not have to domuch rapid draw of information from the file, then they should be able to getby very adequately with a much lower priced terminal.andP;  Using this type ofterminal, examiners should also be able to interface with the productioncontrol system or what we call the electronic file wrapper.andP;  Examiners willbe able to pull up other correspondence that the inventor has sent inrelative to the patent application.andP;  The examiner will also be able to lookat comments or previous decisions that have been sent back to the inventor.andO;A terminal designed for these purposes should be able to handle theselow-speed patent-searching applications.andM;So, at some point in time, we think we might be able to do better than the3:1 ratio on workstations.andP;  If we could actually take some of the workloadoff our high-speed workstations and put it on these other terminals, thatmeans that we could get by with fewer of the more powerful machines and endup with more workstations overall.andP;  But that day isn't here yet because thetechnology still isn't available.andP;  Today's 386 and 486 PCs can't take acompressed image and expand it back up rapidly enough.andP;  That scenariopromises to change within the next two years when 486-class machines withspecial screens should be able to handle some of the slower speed work that'snow intended for the big workstations.andP;  We don't have to make that decisionon the 486 before we start to buy in quantity in 1992.andP;  We will certainlyhave a lot more information by then.andM;Q: What type of communications network will all these workstations be linkedinto?andM;A: We have been in the first stage of implementing a massive digital switch.andO;Our original plan was to use a cascade approach, whereby a pyramid ofswitches would switch into other switches and so on, so that we would end upconnecting everything point to point.andP;  Any workstation could connect throughthis maze of switches to any optical device that it needed to pull a filefrom.andP;  At the time, this was the only way we could maintain ourone-page-per-second pace.andM;After considering the findings from a recent study, we decided to replacethat network with an FDDI [Fiber Distributed Data Interface] network.andP;  Usingfiber as the backbone, we will construct local area Ethernet loops for thedifferent clusters.andP;  This approach is much cheaper than the switch.andP;  We arealso impressed by the flexibility that FDDI will give us.andP;  First of all, itwill enable us to accommodate our examiners who have different work patternsand who move around from building to building.andP;  With FDDI, there's almost nolimit to the capacity you can get.andP;  You just string more fiber and make moreloops.andP;  So after I get some idea of utilization, I can then relativelyrapidly reconfigure for higher utilization if necessary.andP;  Secondly, bystringing fiber all over the campus, we can have a universal network withessentially the same amount of overhead it takes to support the imagesubsystems on the APS.andP;  We think that we can go out with our procurementlater this year, looking for a bid shopping list of FDDI equipment.andM;Q: What's so unique about the Automated Patent System?andM;A: What's unique about our system is not the size of the files.andP;  A lot ofpeople could conceivably have files as large as ours.andP;  And other people havefast file retrieval requirements that are similar to ours.andP;  But nobody hasboth large and fast.andP;  Just imagine 1,000 workstations banging away at a filethe size of ours and everyone expecting to see pages at a rate of one persecond.andP;  Both these requirements of speed and file size drive you in twodifferent technological directions.andP;  Since we have a large-scale imagingapplication, we had to build it around the jukebox or HDD technology.andP;  Thespeed mandate meant that we had to go for special high-end workstationsbecause 386 technology simply did not have the horsepower we needed.andM;Q: What is the biggest technological hurdle you face?andM;A: If you have our problem, which is rapid access to massive amounts of data,then you are forced to do component-level integration.andP;  The workstation, thestorage device, everything is an off-the-shelf component.andP;  So that has meantthat we've had to do board-level integration work.andP;  And because softwaresimply doesn't exist, we've had to write our own.andM;Q: In what areas is the APS breaking new ground?andM;A: We are breaking a lot of ground in terms of moving big volumes at highspeed.andP;  We have learned how to pump as much as possible out of opticaldrives.andP;  We've also been good at configuring our networks and protocols.andP;  Onthe people side of the image-processing equation, we've learned a lot aboutthe ergonomic effects of the technology.andP;  We know what the examiners canstand and what they can't.andP;  We've learned a great deal about the technicalrequirements needef for screens, furniture and things like that.andP;  In fact, weare spending lots of money so that examiners will be able to electronicallyadjust essentially everything in their work environment to suit theirindividual needs.andP;  The angles of everything from the screen to the keyboardand chair are all adjustable.andM;Q: How are you managing a project of such mammoth proportions?andM;A: We have organized this on what we call a spiral or evolutionarydevelopment model.andP;  In following that model, we periodically reassess ourrequirements based upon information as we gain it.andP;  And at the same time, welook at technology and reassess what's happening there.andP;  The goal is to tryto keep a balance.andP;  You can't constantly be jerking the system around.andP;  Yet,on the other hand, you don't want to commit to something early that ends upbeing obsolete.andP;  So we do a lot of technology forecasting.andM;We are taking a theoretical approach that has been used by some privatesector companies on a small scale.andP;  We are doing it on a gargantuan scale.andP;  Iknow of no one who's working on this scale with this kind of methodology.andP;  Inaddition, we are helping establish some formal methodologies for how tomanage technical uncertainties.andP;  Many people talk about it, but we areactually developing whole new methods for managing uncertainty and givingthem a formal structure.andM;The necessity to coordinate a project of this scope with its inherentuncertainty forces you to manage that uncertainty explicity forces you tomanage what you're uncertain about, defer things until they're more certainand to undertake activities that will reduce that uncertainty.andM;Q: How does this translate in terms of technology?andM;A: I've had to start off on my journey toward a goal knowing that I don'thave all the details in hand that will permit me to finish.andP;  It's a longprocess.andP;  Technology is changing under me as I'm going along.andP;  I want to beable to take advantage of that.andP;  To do that, your understanding of yourrequirements has to evolve as you gain experience with the technology.andM;Q: Has this management of uncertainty been your biggest challenge?andM;A: Yes, this has been the most challenging part of the project and certainlythe area where I've learned my biggest lesson.andP;  I have to constantly focus onwhat I don't know, yet at the same time I have to keep moving.andP;  There's noway to simply stop and learn because, by the time I've learned something,other uncertainties have arisen.andP;  Technology may have changed again or theexperience of examiners using the system may have shed new insights.andP;  So thisis a truly dynamic process.andP;  And how to manage a dynamic process isn't wellunderstood.andM;Q: Isn't the uncertainty factor implicit in imaging technology?andM;A: It's true that the imaging area is high in uncertainty.andP;  That's because itends to make basic changes in the way business is done.andP;  So you can't trustthat you understand the technical requirements well to start with.andO;Prototypes are no help here either, because it's my belief that the systemthe user has must actually do real work.andP;  This is especially true in imagingenvironments where you are making fundamental changes in the way things aredone.andP;  This means that the users have to be committed to the system's usedand to its success.andP;  Only then can they begin working together with you tohelp break down the boundaries created by paper.andP;  We already see thathappening with our examiners.andM;Q: What is the historical organizational setting for imaging technology?andM;A: The easy IS chores have already been done.andP;  We've done the payroll.andP;  We'vedone the accounting systems.andP;  We've done the integration at the low levels.andO;With imaging, our reach is now expanding to encompass the massive kinds ofintegration programs that promise to radically change the way information iscommunicated through companies, through divisions and through governmentdepartments.andP;  It would have been unheard of to be this ambitious 15 yearsago.andP;  But now we can.andM;Q: Is the U.S.andP;  government at the forefront of this imaging frontier?andM;A: I think the government is the leader here because of its size.andP;  Thegovernment has problems of scale and of scope that really bring all theelements I've discussed to the fore.andP;  Here at the Patent and Trademark Officewe have a 200-year-old process that's absolutely embedded in paper.andP;  Andpeople here, no matter how well thinking they are, simply cannot make theleap to understanding how we should handle that process with electronicimages.andP;  And, quite honestly, there is no way to make that leap because thechanges are going to be too subtle.andP;  Ten years from now, this office is goingto operate in a substantially different way than it operates now.andP;  Butexactly what those differences will be, I'm not sure.andP;  What I'm trying to dois design the order of implementation, design the use of the system by usersin such a way that I can derive the most information--information that I canuse to comprehend the changes that are necessary.andP;  Only then can I activelyincorporate those changes into the system.andP;  And we're already doing thistoday.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
