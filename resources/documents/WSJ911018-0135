If theopposition wins, Turkey's future could be the deja vu of theeconomic devastation and political chaos of the 1970s.   Economic growth and political stability over the pastdecade have transformed Turkey into an important commercialcenter and one of the West's most reliable allies in avolatile region. Since his party came to power in 1983, Mr.Ozal's free-market reforms helped Turkish consumers growaccustomed to a wide range of foreign goods, higher qualitydomestic products, a growing tourist industry and new exportmarkets.</LP><TEXT>   But the inflation rate is around 70%, unemployment at 15%and there have been some troubled privatizations of stateindustries. To most outsiders Turkey's economic troubles arethe growing pangs of a country unloading the dead weight ofpast statist policies. To the Motherland Party's competitionthey are seen as a ticket to a change of government.   One of the main opposition contenders is SuleymanDemirel's True Path Party. Mr. Demirel is a politician of theold school. He has been prime minister six times and twicewas forced to resign by the army for policies beset bycorruption, economic crises and a complete breakdown oforder. Mr. Demirel has capitalized on charges of corruptionand nepotism against Mr. Ozal. Still, Mr. Demirel's record ofpolitical expediency and opposition to opening Turkey toforeign competition make many wonder if he has experienced agenuine free-market conversion.   Mr. Ozal's main competition on the left is Erdal Inonu,leader of the Social Democratic Populist Party. Apparently,Mr. Inonu's party has allied itself with the pro-KurdishPeople's Labour Party, which in turn has the backing of theoutlawed Marxist Kurdish Worker's Party. The alliance maybring in important votes since, for much of eastern Turkey,the election is viewed as critical to chances for a Kurdishnation.   The yeasty political process now bubbling in Turkey is awelcome product of reform. But even democracies arevulnerable to reaction. A Demirel victory invites back theeconomic crises and political free-for-all of the '70s. AnInonu victory promises to further ignite volatile Kurdishresistance movements and to reverse the policies that haveopened Turkey's economy.   Though the position of president isn't directly at stake,the opposition parties have sworn to oust Mr. Ozal. Turkeyhas endured three military regimes in as many decades,resurgent waves of terrorism, corruption and economicdevastation. But despite its progress, Turkey is still new atthe game of multiparty democracy. Every election is a testnot only of the parties and candidates but the strength ofdemocracy itself. The new government, however constituted,will determine whether Turkey continues forward or reverts tothe darkness and disorder of its past.</TEXT></DOC>
