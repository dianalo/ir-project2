Whilenatural gas's share of total energy use has been declining in the UnitedStates, it has risen in the Soviet Union from 23 percent in 1970 to thehigh 30s now. The current decade has brought gas not just recognition,but dominance. As oil supplies began to decline and coal failed to meetits quotas, Soviet leaders in the 1970s twice studied the possibilityof an energy policy centered on gas. In 1980-81 they considered thatoption a third time - and finally chose it. For all its rapid growth,however, the gas industry of the USSR has had problems as well. Someof them are described in this article. Discussion also is included aboutthe Soviet Union increasing its gas exports to Western Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
