A kinematical model for the expanding ring has beenfitted to the positions and velocities of the observed molecular peaks.It suggests that the ring is tilted by 36 deg with respect to the lineof sight and is expanding at 14 km/s. The molecular clouds, which lieon a well-defined ellipse just outside the edge of the H II region, coincidewith a ring of dust clouds and diffuse IR emission. The distributionand velocity of ionized, atomic, and molecular gases suggest that LambdaOri formed at the center of a flattened molecular cloud which was disruptedby a combination of the gas pressure within the H II region created byLambda Ori and the rocket effect. A model is presented for the evolutionof a flattened or oblate molecular cloud at whose center an O star forms.The parameters of the model compare favorably with the observed characteristicsof the Lambda Ori system, with the exception of the velocity of LambdaOri itself. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are noted. 47 references.</TEXT></DOC>
