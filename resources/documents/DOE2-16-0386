When the spark cell is dried, the S{sub 2}F{sub 10}yield was 6.8 {times} 10{sup {minus}11} mol/J at an SF{sub 6} pressureP = 133 kPa. Moisture appears to suppress the S{sub 2}F{sub 10} yield,although once formed, the S{sub 2}F{sub 10} is quite stable with respectto moisture. This could explain the variation in observation from experimentto experiment in the literature. These results also raise important questionsas to the influence of drying agents that are used in high-voltage systemson the S{sub 2}F{sub 10} yield. 13 refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
