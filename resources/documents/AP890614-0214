(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Charles ``Chuck'' Simmons took over aspolice chief in this Atlanta suburb last year, the first thing hedid was get rid of the traditional six-shot, .38-caliber revolver.   ``We've just finished our transition to the 9mm Glocksemiautomatic pistol, which can carry up to 20 rounds,'' Simmonssaid. ``Now, we're looking at replacing our shotguns with 9mmcarbines.''   Simmons isn't alone in beefing up his arsenal. More and morepolice departments, big and small, are switching to semiautomatic orfully automatic weapons. Most of the new weapons fire 9mm bullets,which are slightly smaller than .38-caliber rounds. Butsemiautomatics use clips that hold many more bullets thantraditional police arms.   Simmons said clip-fed pistols and rifles give the police threethings they badly need to combat today's heavily armed criminals:more firepower, quicker reloading and greater accuracy over longerdistances.   Simmons came to Marietta from Palm Bay, Fla., where, he says, hisofficers ``were outgunned'' in a 1987 shootout at two shoppingcenters with a man carrying a semiautomatic rifle with a 30-roundclip.   ``Two police officers were among the six people killed,'' hesaid. ``It appeared one of our officers was fatally wounded whiletrying to reload his empty revolver.''   Simmons, who said Palm Bay was switching to semiautomatic pistolsat the time of the shootout, now has re-armed three departments inseven years.   ``I'm either a leader in the field or a jerk, depending upon yourpoint of view,'' he said.   The trend goes against other efforts to ban high-firepowerweapons, such as California's recent law against civilian possessionof the AK-47 assault rifle, and it troubles some law enforcementofficials.   ``It's true the police are facing ever more dangerous weapons,''said Hubert Williams, director of the Police Foundation, a lawenforcement think tank in Washington. ``However, the police are partof the civilian population in this country and, to the degree weincrease the type of arms they bear, they become, to that samedegree, a more military-type police force.''   Simmons feels much the same.   ``Ideally, we shouldn't need these new weapons,'' he said. ``Butthere are so many semiautomatics on the street these days it wouldtake years to get rid of them, even if we banned them tomorrow.Meanwhile, we simply can't afford to let ourselves be outgunned whenthe shooting starts.''   Police SWAT teams have used powerful weapons for years, but it'sthe cop on the beat who is getting the new 9mm pistols with nameslike Glock, Beretta, Ruger, Sig Sauer and Taurus.   ``These new `nines' with the funny names are where it's at rightnow,'' said Dewey Stokes, president of the 198,000-member FraternalOrder of Police.   ``We know that many, many of our members have switched over to`nines,' but we don't know just how many,'' he said. ``We're pollingthem in an effort to find out.''   The National Sheriffs Association is conducting a similar poll ofthe nation's 29,000 sheriffs and deputies.   ``We feel that the wheel gun, or revolver, just isn't adequateanymore,'' said Bud Meeks, director of the sheriffs association.   Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Miami, Boston, Atlanta andColumbus, Ohio, are among big city police departments converting tosemiautomatic pistols, and Chicago is studying the idea.   New York decided to stick with six-shot revolvers, but several ofits suburbs have switched.   ``The movement definitely isn't confined to big cities,'' saidCheryl Epps of the International Association of Police Chiefs.   ``While D.C. is going to 9mm, for example, Prince William County,Virginia, further up the road, also is armed to the teeth with fullyautomatic weapons. They're everywhere now,'' she said.   In Winnetka, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, Police Chief Herbert Timmcreated a stir when he proposed putting Uzi machine guns in squadcars.   Simmons, here in Marietta, said he also has considered machineguns.   ``We feel the shotgun is outdated as a street weapon, given whatwe're coming up against,'' he said. ``Just a few days ago, forexample, we answered a routine trouble call and wound upconfiscating an AR-15, the commercial variety of the M-16semiautomatic rifle.''   Sgt. Jack Schmida, firearms expert with the Los Angeles PoliceDepartment, said an LAPD officer was killed last year by a gunmanwith an AR-15.   ``The drug dealers usually shoot each other with these weapons,but they do shoot at us from time to time,'' said Schmida, whosedepartment will begin Monday to slowly phase in 9mm Berettas byissuing them to new recruits.   In Columbus, Ohio, police officers are given a choice.   ``Our officers can carry a 16-shot, 9mm semiautomatic or anine-shot, clip-loaded .45-caliber pistol,'' said Dewey Stokes, amember of the 1,300-member force.   ``With the .38s the officer carried a total of 18 rounds,counting the 12 in his belt and six in the revolver,'' Stokes said.``Now, with the `nines,' they will carry 48 rounds, and that's aheckuva difference.''   In Houston, officers are armed with a variety of pistols.   ``They buy their own weapon and can carry practically anythingthey want,'' said firearms instructor J.W. Walston. ``As a result,our officers carry a multitude of calibers, everything from 9mm to.44 Magnums to .45s. However, we do encourage them to not carry.38s, and we suggest they use hollow point rounds.''   Many urban police departments have begun using hollow pointbullets, a soft-nosed round that has greater stopping power. Ittends to spread out and produce more wallop from increased tissuedamage.   Some financially strapped cities can't make make across-the-boardpurchases of semiautomatic pistols, which cost from $350 to $550.But they frequently permit officers to buy their own sidearms.   That is the case in Stockton, Calif., where a gunman armed withan AK-47 rifle opened fire on a schoolyard in January, killing fivechildren and wounding 29 students and a teacher.   Sgt. Ed Williams, a 24-year veteran of the Stockton force, saidhe made the switch and became a big fan of the 9mm pistol.   ``I'm not a gun nut,'' he said. ``In fact, I wouldn't mind goingto the English method of unarmed police officers, but the switchfrom a .38 to a 9mm has greatly improved my accuracy andconfidence.''   Officers in Walla Walla, Wash., Huntington, W.Va., and Muskogee,Okla., also may buy their own semiautomatic pistols. In Muskogee,three-fourths of the 75 officers have switched to 9mm, police Maj.Rex Eskridge said.   Like many towns in Florida, where drug trafficking isparticularly heavy, Palm Bay has come to see 9mm weapons as anecessity.   ``In addition to the 9mm sidearms, we also provide our officerswith 9mm rifles,'' said Frank McBee, the department's firing rangeofficer. ``Right now, we're getting five to 10 requests a week fromother law enforcement agencies for information about the rifles. Therequests have come from all around the country; even the FBI hasrequested information about them.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 18</NOTE></DOC>
