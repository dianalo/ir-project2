The magnitudeof vertical salt loss due to dissolution is interminable at this timebecause original salt thickness is unknown. Gradual thinning of the UpperSeven Rivers Formation is recognized from south to north across the PaloDuro Basin. Anhydrites within the formation pinch out toward the basinmargins, indicating that section loss is in part depositionally controlled.Additionally, informal subdivision of the Upper Seven Rivers Formationsuggests that salt dissolution has occurred in the uppermost salt. Anortheast-trending zone of thin Upper Seven Rivers Formation in portionsof Deaf Smith, Randall, Castro, and Parmer Counties is possibly relatedto Tertiary dissolution. In New Mexico, local thinning of the Upper SevenRivers Formation may be associated with faulting. Triassic erosion onuplifted fault blocks has affected the Upper Permian section. The Saladosalt margin is located within the interior Palo Duro Basin. Geophysicalwell logs and core evidence indicate that the salt margin has migratedbasinward as a result of dissolution. Permian dissolution probably contributedto some salt loss. 106 refs., 31 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
