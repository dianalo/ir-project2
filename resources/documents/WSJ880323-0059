Tokyo share prices skidded on uncertainty regarding the course of U.S. stocks and interest rates in the wake of Monday's 20.23-point fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks fell 123.51 points to close at 25842.75. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 7.49 to 2127.40. Volume was estimated at 1.1 billion shares, down from 1.2 billion shares Friday. The Tokyo market was closed Monday.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, share prices were firmer. The Nikkei index rose 89.57 points to 25932.32 at the end of the morning session.    Light electrical issues declined Tuesday. Issues connected with the huge Tokyo Bay redevelopment project outperformed the rest of the market on a raft of speculative buying prodded by large Japanese securities houses.    Traders said most share prices closed lower despite strength in development-related and other speculative issues, as major brokerages took a cautious stance toward recent weakness in the U.S. bond market and feelings that U.S. interest rates will move higher later this year. Fear of a U.S. economic downturn in mid-1988, higher interest rates and possible inflationary pressures are being blamed in Tokyo for Monday's drop in New York.    &quot;The prevailing wisdom is that U.S. and Japanese prices ran up too quickly since the crash,&quot; said one broker, predicting that Japan's big securities houses will avoid pushing share prices too high in the next few weeks to guard against a potential correction.    A meeting among representatives of the securities companies to select &quot;hot issues&quot; for promotion with investors, however, furnished the impetus for Tuesday's surge in development-related stocks.    Shares such as Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, with extensive land holdings figuring in the Tokyo Bay redevelopment, surged as a result. IHI rose 57 yen to 970 ($7.50), while Tokyo Gas, another property holder, sprinted ahead 20 to 1,230.    Also notable were shares of Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales, a vehicle sales dealer affiliated with Nissan Motor, which soared on rumors that it was the takeover target of an unknown buyer. Tokyo Nissan last traded at 2,460, up 250 points for the day.    London share prices closed narrowly mixed, with many prices depressed by continued thin trading volume in the opening days of an extended trading account period.    The Financial Times 30-share index gained 0.5 point to 1463.2, but the 100-share index was down 5.7 points at 1835.4. Volume was barely changed at a scant 357.1 million shares, compared with 357.3 million Monday.    Shares opened lower following the Monday decline on Wall Street. They attempted a rally in midmorning but quickly ran out of steam. A feeble opening in New York on Tuesday further damped sentiment in London afternoon dealings.    Dealers said there was little institutional business as many participants kept to the sidelines in the early days of the extended trading account, which runs for three weeks instead of the usual two. Trading was heavier in selected shares in response to corporate earnings announcements.    Peninsular andamp; Oriental Steam Navigation reported its 1987 pretax profit rose 58%. The results favorably surprised the market and Pandamp;O shares jumped 16 pence to 605 ($11).    Prudential Corp. slumped 23 to 858. The company said 1987 pretax profit rose 15.7%, falling short of analysts' forecasts.    Share prices ended mixed in uneventful dealings on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Traders said price consolidation continued despite a firmer dollar.    The dollar was set at the official rate of 1.6914 marks at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing, up from 1.6907 marks Monday.    Traders said activity was light throughout the session with domestic and foreign investors on both sides of the market. &quot;There wasn't much interest in stocks,&quot; said one dealer.    Dealers said the only lively issue was Volkswagen, whose stock went up 4.8 marks to end at 245.6 ($145). Late Monday, the West German government announced it would sell its 16% stake in the car maker at 238 marks a share Thursday.    Dealers said placement of Volkswagen shares isn't expected to be a problem. One reason Volkswagen seems attractive is that the government stake comes with a 10-mark dividend for each common share. There's also talk in the market of an additional 1-mark anniversary dividend to be paid this year on each common share.    Shares of other car makers retreated. Bayerische Motoren Werke fell 7 to 526, while Daimler-Benz declined 3 to 688.5.    Stocks of chemical companies were mixed. BASF declined 1.7 to 250, and Bayer went down 1.4 to 273.7, while Hoechst edged 1.1 higher to 264.7, and Schering was up 1 at 461.    Share prices closed lower in Stockholm, Paris, Milan and Zurich, and mixed in Brussels and Amsterdam.    Paris was hit by a combination of month-end technical selling, concern about the weak tone on Wall Street and domestic political uncertainty, traders said.    In Pacific markets, share prices closed lower in Sydney, Seoul and Singapore and were mixed in Wellington, Hong Kong, Manila and Taipei.    In Sydney, profit-taking and futures-related program selling sent share prices reeling in sometimes hectic activity. Hong Kong shares ended mixed for the second consecutive day, as the decline on Wall Street overnight left many investors uncertain about the local market's direction.
