The tentative proposal for RJR Nabisco from a group led by theinvestment firm First Boston Corp. and the Pritzker family ofChicago would be nearly double the biggest acquisition on record,Chevron Corp.'s $13.4 billion purchase of Gulf Oil Corp. in 1984.   The First Boston proposal, its first expression of interest inthe consumer goods giant, easily topped two sweetened offers made byRJR management and the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   RJR Nabisco, which is based in Atlanta, is the nation's 19thbiggest industrial company, and the maker of hundreds of consumeritems that range from Jose Cuervo tequila and Salem cigarettes toLife Savers candy and Milk Bone dog snacks.   The offers disclosed Sunday top all previous bids, and a specialRJR committee that is running the auction indicated that itsdecision to extend the bidding period could produce even higheroffers.   ``Due to the varying potential values and nature of theconsideration offered in the two bids and the proposal, and thevarying terms, conditions and contingencies associated with each,the special committee determined not to make any recommendation atthis time'' regarding any of the proposals, said Charles E. Hugel,the committee's chairman.   The five-member committee of RJR Nabisco's board of directorsalso said it would accept bids through Nov. 29. The panel hadinitially cut off bidding at 5 p.m. last Friday.   The preliminary offer by the First Boston-Pritzker group wouldinvolve the acquisition in 1989 of RJR's tobacco business, whichaccounts for about 40 percent of its annual sales, followed by theinstallment sale of its food businesses.   First Boston indicated the total consideration could range from$98 to $110 cash a share, plus securities and stock warrants valuedat from $7 to $8 a share. The warrants would entitle RJRshareholders to acquire up to 20 percent of the tobacco business.   At $118 a share, the maximum possible offer from the group wouldbe $26.6 billion.   The committee said the management-led group, which is allied withthe investment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and SalomonBrothers Inc., had raised its offer to $100 a share in cash for 175million of the company's 225.3 million outstanding common shares.   The group said it would acquire the remaining shares for $56cash, plus securities and common stock in the surviving company thatit said would bring the total consideration to $100 a share. Thecommon stock would equal about 15 percent of the surviving company'soutstanding shares, according to the special committee.   The $100 a share offer values RJR at $22.5 billion. Themanagement group's previous offer had been for $92 a share, or $20.7billion.   The new offer by Kohlberg Kravis _ which previously had offered$90 a share, or about $20.3 billion _ included $94 cash a share forabout 178 million RJR Nabisco shares, with the remaining shares tobe exchanged for preferred stock and securities the firm valued at$94 a share, giving its offer an indicated value of about $21.2billion.   Management started the bidding a month ago when it announced itwas considering a buyout offer, and Kohlberg Kravis quickly enteredthe fray with a competing bid.   Both parties submitted firm offers to the RJR committee byFriday's deadline, but they said late Sunday they were undecidedwhether to make new offers.</TEXT></DOC>
