(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Micro CAD SoftwareandM;Twenty years after the advent of computer-aided design, PC-based CAD enjoysone of the most successful vertical software markets, accounting for 20percent of 1988 computer graphics sales.andM;CAD software used to run only on expensive workstations.andP;  But by 1988, 73percent of all CAD systems shipped were PC-based according to Dataquest Inc.andO;of San Jose, Calif.andM;That percentage may rise as high as 90 percent in 1990.andP;  Vendors ofworkstation CAD products have been improving their engineering capabilitiesto regain market share.andM;Tom Kucharvy, president of Summit Strategies of Boston, predicted the PC andworkstation distribution channels will merge, with PC distributors offeringmore complex operating systems and more powerful network configurations.andM;Because most PC-based CAD sales are software packages rather than completesystems, buyers often look to value-added resellers for advice on hardwarememory requirements, monitors, input/output and networking devices.andM;Prices for PC-based CAD software range from $99 up to $5,000.andP;  Software fromcompanies like American Small Business Computers Inc., Foresight ResourcesCorp., IMSI and Generic Software Inc. compares favorably with highendworkstation packages.andM;More CustomersandM;Many PC-based CAD packages still have copy protection, which seemsunnecessary because they are hard to use without manuals and vendor support.andO;Despite this handicap, low-end CAD packages steadily are increasing theiruser bases, according to Research Analyst Gesela Wilson of International DataCorp., Framingham, Mass.andM;Wilson said the installed base for Generic Software Inc.'s Generic CADD was170,000 in 1988 and is projected at 260,000 in 1989.andP;  Evolution Computing'sEasyCAD2 user base is expected to rise from 75,000 in 1988 to 125,000 in1989; American Small Business Computers Inc.'s DesignCAD from 156,000 to206,000; and Foresight Resources Corp.'s Drafix CAD from 30,000 to 41,150.andM;Wilson also said high-end CAD systems like Intergraph Corp.'s MicroStationare being ported down to the PC level.andM;One way low-end developers can offer high-end features is through extensions.andO;Generic Software Inc., for example, sells three levels of software as well assolids-modeling extensions.andM;However, high-end developers argue that their packages already include allthose features at one price, and that low-end software costs just as muchwith the extensions added.andM;CADkey Inc. president Livingston Davies said users are demanding greatercomplexity in CAD packages, but with interfaces that are easier to learn anduse.andM;Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and icons spare the user from having toremember text menus and commands.andM;The top GUI contenders are Windows from Microsoft Corp., Hewlett-PackardCo.'s New Wave, Digital Research Inc.'s GEM and Presentation Manager for IBMCorp. PS/2s, as well as various UNIX interfaces such as Open Look, News and XWindow.andM;No one should expect a single GUI standard to emerge; all these interfacesprobably will continue to evolve along with their applications.andM;CAD software makes heavy demands not only on its user interface, but also onhardware and operating systems.andP;  Early CAD on dedicated workstations hadidiosyncratic user interfaces and sometimes no support at all for differentplatforms.andP;  However, interoperability across platforms has become such amajor issue for the 1990s that even high-end CAD software will have to fallinto line.andM;Meanwhile, a general effort is under way to standardize not only the userinterface but also data exchange and device independence.andP;  CAD file formatsare proprietary, and even the so-called standard formats such as thegovernment's Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) lack truecompatibility across software.andP;  Anyone who ever attempted a file conversionhas had loss or garbling of data.andM;The present de facto industry standard is the DXF format, introduced byAutodesk Inc.andP;  DXF files can be imported to some desktop publishing programs.andM;Octal Inc., Mountain view, Calif., provides an alternative to IGES byconverting directly between disparate file formats instead of convertingfiles from different CAD packages into IGES.andM;The company has 78 direct converters of both graphical and non-graphicalfiles between 33 different CAD systems.andP;  Although the conversions usuallyneed minor touch-ups, some users say they are better than IGES.andM;CAD packages build up drawings out of &quot;primitives&quot; or entities such aspoints, straight or parallel lines, rectangles, polygons, arcs and circles.andO;Some packages do freeform sketching.andP;  Typically, the user specifies thedesired object's coordinates and sets the scale to translate the units ofmeasure into real-world dimensions.andM;Most CAD packages have grid, zoom/pan and editing capabilities as well as anUNDO command.andP;  The best packages can unerase the last erasure or command.andM;CAD packages also can rotate and resize objects, fill them with color orhatching and join two endpoints.andP;  Good packages calculate dimensionsautomatically.andM;Mechanical DesignandM;Certain packages handle only mechanical design, architecture, civil orstructural engineering, electronics or mapping.andP;  Mechanical design nowrepresents the most substantial area of CAD use.andP;  Software selected formechanical design should feature:andM;* Three-dimensional design, which makes far heavier hardware demands thantwo-dimensional design.andM;* An extensive library of primitives.andM;* Capability for integration with programmable machine tools, materialshandling systems or robots.andM;Civil and structural engineering CAD made up 20 percent of the CAD market in1988.andP;  Special requirements include:andM;* Powerful platforms because of the sheer size of such projects.andM;* An extensive library of standard fittings and elements.andM;* Large disk storage space.andM;* Capability to transform designs into blueprints.andM;* High-quality digitizing support to capture existing blueprints.andM;CAD for electronics differs considerably from other uses.andP;  Electronics CADaccounted for 23 percent of the market in 1988.andM;Snapping BackandM;Electronics CAD systems design circuit boards and route connections betweenboard components.andP;  Simple systems draw only the board, while better systemshave a &quot;rubber banding&quot; facility that stretches connections over the shortestclear path.andP;  High-end packages feature sophisticated routing support andcomponents libraries.andM;A CAD package for mapping should include all the features mentioned above,along with a large and powerful PC platform.andM;Formerly, only the high end of CAD software could do 3-D solids modeling.andO;But that is changing rapidly with more powerful hardware.andP;  Some low-costprograms add surface shading, texture, reflectivity and shadows.andP;  However,the objects look realistic only when considerable time is invested.andP;  Evensimple renderings take substantial time; complex 3-D models withphotorealistic effects take an enormous amount.andM;Autodesk Inc.'s AutoShade is the most common 3-D rendering package, althoughit is not interactive.andP;  Nth Graphics Ltd.'s Nth 3-D Engine graphicscontroller can manipulate entire AutoCAD drawings and basic 3-D renderings onthe card, with instant pan and zoom.andP;  The card comes with software calledHydra, which looks and behaves exactly like AutoShade.andM;Many other CAD packages have 3-D rendering as an add-on.andM;Animation, or solids modeling in motion, lets the viewer see an objectsuccessively from different angles.andP;  By layering separate files, the designercan piece together objects in different planes with different colors to showcomponent parts.andM;Bill Nagel of HM Systems in Gaithersburg, Md., said animation typicallyrequires adding a video board to the CAD platform.andP;  &quot;Walk-throughs,&quot; orsuccessive views from different perspectives, are compiled using both thesolids-modeling software and the board software.andP;  A videorecorder stores thewalk-through results for later viewing.andM;Many CAD software developers offer animation as an add-on or throughthird-party vendors.andM;Accounting for TastesandM;Good CAD packages are customizable, which accounts for AutoCAD's popularity.andO;The degree to which the user can customize commands and interfaces is a goodmeasure of overall versatility.andP;  Some packages do limited customizationthrough macros, while others boast full-blown programming languages.andM;Most PC CAD programs work best with 80386 or 80486 micros and mathcoprocessors.andP;  MS-DOS extenders also are valuable to access memory beyond the640K limit.andP;  For example, Anvil 5000 PC, CADmax 3D and VersaCAD/386 all comewith MS-DOS extenders for 386 computers.andP;  They require a math coprocessor anda minimum of 4M extended memory.andM;Vendors also have begun developing OS/2 and UNIX versions of their softwarein an attempt to overcome the 640K RAM limit of MS-DOS.andM;What does the future hold for CAD?andP;  For one thing, optical-disk technologylikely will allow storage of vast knowledge bases on small systems.andM;The spread of networked PCs will mean that more and more design environmentshave libraries of primitives available to networked stations.andP;  This allowsteams of engineers and designers to work concurrently on the same project,such as NASA's space station.andM;Future systems also will accept video input from a camera, making possiblethe capture of graphic data from actual objects without intermediatedrawings.andM;CAD no longer will be restricted to people with technical training.andP;  GenericSoftware Inc.'s Tina Eliason, for example, said only half the company's usersare engineers or architects.andM;Drafting vs.andP;  DesigningandM;However, beginners should be sure of their purpose before buying CAD.andO;PC-based CAD systems are useful for both drafting and designing, and it isimportant to note the distinctions between them.andP;  Drafting systems producedrawings.andP;  Design systems are more application-oriented and tend to be usedon an as-needed basis.andM;To ease the learning curve for beginners, an increasing number ofMS-DOS-based CAD vendors are developing software to run under MicrosoftWindows and Presentation Manager.andP;  Foresight Resources Corp., for example,has released a Windows version of its Drafix.andM;Among the lower-end packages, compatibility with hardware and operatingsystems is very important to users.andP;  The packages that support the mostinput/output devices and displays sell the best.andM;Ease of use also matters a great deal because of the inherent complexity ofCAD software and the cost of training.andP;  Many vendors build in graphicssubroutines or macros in C and Pascal that can be called to execute commonfunctions.andM;Surprisingly, the low-end CAD packages tend to have easy installationroutines, while high-end packages like AutoCAD do not have automatedinstallation but instead rely on a maze of confusing instructions.andM;Among the leading PC-based CAD packages, Anvil 5000PC 1.1 is the oldestmechanical-design software on the market.andP;  Harking back to the mainframeworld, it remains a package for specialists.andP;  Anvil has relatively fewfeatures for the price.andP;  It does have great power if the buyer spends morefor options.andM;AutoCAD Release 10, the standard by which other PC CAD packages are judged,is well known for its steep learning curve.andP;  Probably the time and effort arejustifiable only for full-time users.andP;  But AutoCAD demands a lot of its usersbecause it delivers.andM;Release 10 does 3-D wire frame construction and surface modeling, and has newdrawing, viewing and database features.andP;  It will run on Macintosh machines.andM;The surface modeling features let the user visualize complex geometries, suchas 3-D revolving surfaces made by rotating a set of elements around an axisin space, 3-D tabulated cylinders and 3-D Coons surfaces defined by fourboundary curves.andM;AutoCAD now has about 275,000 users worldwide and 7,400 third-party add-ons,according to Autodesk Inc. spokesman Andrew Zarillo.andP;  The company isdeveloping a new 3-D drawing technology it calls Cyberspace.andM;AutoSketch V. 1.0, another Autodesk offering, should have better support ofsoftware drivers for input/output devices.andP;  It is not adequate for seriousdrafting and designing.andM;AutoSolid, another Autodesk product, is a full solids-modeling package forAutoCAD and MS-DOS users.andP;  It creates 3-D models with constructive solidgeometry and boundary representation.andP;  Complex solids come from basic blocks,cones, cylinders, spheres and wedges.andM;CADkey Inc.'s Version 3.5 includes CADL, a proprietary programming language,and CADkey Solids, which shades objects with arcs or splines.andP;  CADkey Solidsalso can differentiate between various sizes of curved entities with greatersegmentation flexibility.andM;CADkey has become a leader in PC-based CAD mainly because of its uniquefeatures and frequent updates.andP;  A mechanical engineering system, it has auser base exceeding 55,000 worldwide and versions in several languages.andM;It can update simultaneously all views of an object and probably is betterthan any other PC-based CAD package at drawing true 3-D wire frame objects.andM;CADkey has the only interface that turns a wire drawing into a full,photograph-like rendering.andP;  It also is the only high-end PC-based system thatalways has offered true 3-D coordinates.andP;  Most other packages merely place asecond copy of the drawing at an angle to the first to give an impression of3-D.andM;The CADL language makes possible linkages to manufacturing systems.andP;  CADkeyalso comes in a UNIX version and has DXF and IGES file converters.andM;CADvance from Isicad Inc. is for 2-D designing and drafting; a 3-Dprojections module is optional.andP;  Translators for other CAD systems also areavailable.andM;Fast CADandM;CADMax 3D 4.0 from Vector Automation Inc. is known for its processing speed,with database tables treating 2-D and 3-D drawings separately.andP;  It comes witha standard cost-of-materials module, programming language and symbollibraries.andP;  Strong copy protection takes the form of a hardware key parked inthe parallel port.andM;While most CAD programs treat surfaces as a conglomerate of smaller units orfacets, CADMax uses mathematical descriptions of the surfaces.andP;  This means a386 machine can rotate a model while simultaneously removing hidden lines inreal time.andM;CADMax has its own menu language, eight user-defined views, cross-viewediting, extensive 3-D view control and independent view editing.andM;DesignCAD V. 3.1 from American Small Business Computers Inc. was voted thebest PC-based CAD package by the National Computer Graphics Association in1988.andP;  It supports more than 200 printers and 80 plotters, and will acceptscanned images from Houston Instruments or Epson scanners.andP;  It does hatching,macros, and parallel and double lines.andM;Drafix 1 Plus from Foresight Resources Corp. can do arithmetic, automaticdimensioning, and linear, radial and diameter calculations.andP;  It has a wordprocessor window.andP;  Absolute, relative or polar coordinates can be enteredfrom the keyboard.andP;  It will save as many as eight views, and the zoomcapability has no limit.andM;Drafix 3-D Modeler lets users create true 3-D models and view them from anyangle, with no limit on the number of views.andP;  The package also has truehidden line removal, rather than masking.andP;  It requires Drafix 1 Plus foroutput.andM;EasyCAD2 from Evolution Computing supports many input/output devices and hasa programming language to customize menus.andP;  It is a good entry-level CADprogram with bidirectional conversion for FastCAD, AutoCAD and VersaCAD, aswell as conversion programs for Aldus PageMaker and Ventura Publisher.andM;Also from Evolution Computing, FastCAD uses customizable pull-down menus anddialogue boxes.andP;  It offers almost infinite zoom possibilities, associativedimensioning and four simultaneous views.andM;Generic Software Inc.'s Generic CADD comes in three levels.andP;  Level 3 is alow-cost choice for casual users.andM;Generic 3-D Drafting comes in response to demand for a 3-D package that usesthe same interface as the 2-D forerunner.andP;  The drafting program offers 3-Dentity creation commands that use dynamic rubber banding so users canvisualize and manipulate drawings as they create them.andP;  Drawings in 2-D canbe upgraded to 3-D and vice versa.andM;MicroStation from Intergraph Corp. grew out of the company's mainframepackage and is a strong seller behind AutoCAD.andP;  There also is a Macintoshversion.andP;  The package has many features of the mainframe version.andP;  It workswith a mouse or digitizing tablet.andM;IMSI's TurboCAD delivers power for a low price.andP;  IMSI spokesman Martin Sackssaid most traditional design still is done in 2-D.andP;  Although users want 3-D,Sacks said the amount of time and work invested in creating 3-D objects maybe disproportionate to the gains.andM;TurboCAD also is used by programmers who need to incorporate graphics intoprograms.andP;  They can create the graphics in TurboCAD and output the sourcecode in either Pascal or BASIC.andM;VersaCAD Corp.'s VersaCAD/386 5.4 started as a package for the Macintosh andlater entered the PC market, where it offers strong competition to AutoCAD.andO;It does 2-D drafting as well as 3-D modeling with light-source color shadingand a 3-D database.andP;  It has a built-in IGES translator and will import andexport AutoCAD files.andM;Like AutoCAD, VersaCAD has a great deal of third-party software.andP;  Processingtime is fast.andP;  Version 5.4 includes dedicated 2-D and 3-D drawing, shadingand hidden-line removal, as well as a cost-of-materials link and aproprietary programming language.andP;  Although the program permits up to 16simultaneous windows, it does so at the price of speed.andM;Ron Mileikowsky is a computer consultant in Potomac, Md.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
