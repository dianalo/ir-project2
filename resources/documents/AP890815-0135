Calls Camps `Life Threatening'; 124 Volunteer to Return</HEAD><BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong's teemingdetention centers are in danger of dying because of malnutrition anddisease, the top U.N. refugee official in the colony said Tuesday.   Robert van Leeuwen called for better food and ``a massiveimmunization campaign'' for boat people being housed on an outlyingisland and on five ferries in Hong Kong's harbor.   Also on Tuesday, 124 Vietnamese refugees, convinced their questfor a new life is over, have volunteered to return to the countrythey fled.   The group, ranging from elderly women to four babies, isscheduled to fly to Vietnam on Thursday in the biggest suchrepatriation of boat people since the first group left in March.   Van Leeuwen based his statements on a preliminary report by U.N.officials about camps housing 6,700 of Hong Kong's 51,000 boatpeople.   Large numbers of children in a camp at Tai A Chau Island and theferries were suffering from ``borderline malnutrition,'' Van Leeuwensaid, although he not say how many.   ``When you have a population which has become weakened throughbelow-standard levels of nutrition they become very vulnerable to anoutbreak of disease which could have life threateningconsequences,'' he said. ``They cannot be expected to continue muchlonger with the diet provided.''   Van Leeuwen's statement is one of several recent criticisms maderecently by U.N. officials of Hong Kong's handling of the boatpeople.   Last week, another U.N. official said the camps were some of theworst he had seen.   ``The space is less than the space given to people in prisonhere,'' said Omar Bakhet, head of the technical support unit for theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Hong Kong. ``It iseven less than what is supposed to be given here for a dog.''   The U.N. organization has alleged that more than 100 boat peoplewere beaten by police during a July 23 disturbance at a detentioncenter in the New Territories section of Hong Kong.   Opposition to the refugees is growing in this crowded colony of 5million people. Residents of one village have organized protests andsit-ins against a planned camp near the High Island reservoir in theNew Territories.   The opposition was evident Tuesday when reporters were brought tothe Lo Wu detention center near the Chinese border to speak withsome of the voluntary returnees.   Posters reading, ``Say no to Viets,'' and ``No more Viets,''lined the entrance to the camp.   Inside the camp, a former army post, children and women in raggedclothing looked out through barbed-wire fences. Vietnamese men inT-shirts smiled and asked for cigarettes.   ``Those people who still have hope will stay,'' said Truang VanBong, a 21-year-old fisherman from Haiphong. ``I have no more hopeso I'm going back. I think my government won't punish me. I believethe assurances of the United Nations.''   Vietnam has promised it won't prosecute its returning citizens.   Other refugees said they were returning because they missed theirfamilies.   ``I miss my old mother very much,'' said Le Thi Minh, 39, afishmonger from Haiphong. She said her brother was unable to carefor her mother because he is in jail for trying to flee Vietnam.   ``We all have to take risks,'' she said about returning. ``Butfor me the pull of my family is too strong.''   The group of 124 will be the third to leave Hong Kong since thevoluntary repatriation program began in March. So far, groups of 75and 68 boat people have returned home.   Adult returnees are given $50 and children 14 and under are given$25. The U.N. will also assist them once they return to their homeswith a food allowance.   They are among the 38,300 Vietnamese who have sailed into HongKong since the British colony adopted a tough policy last yearruling out resettlement for most of them.   Under the new policy, Vietnamese are considered refugees only ifthey can prove they fled their homeland beccause of persecution.</TEXT></DOC>
