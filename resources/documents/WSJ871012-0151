Webb OmitsDividend, CitingProfit Uncertainty---By Pauline YoshihashiStaff Reporter ofThe Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WBBDIVIDENDS (DIV) </IN><TEXT>   Del E. Webb Corp. omitted its dividend for the third quarter and suspended further payouts indefinitely, citing uncertainty about this year's earnings and a possible restructuring or divestiture.    It last paid a quarterly dividend of five cents a share on Sept. 1.    Robert K. Swanson, chairman and chief executive officer, said the omission &quot;is prudent and in the best interests of all shareholders&quot; because of the concerns the company has expressed about 1987 earnings levels and Webb's consideration of various restructuring alternatives.    The Phoenix, Ariz.-based developer and manager of retirement communities, real estate and gambling properties also increased to $20 million from the previously reported $10 million its estimate of the negative impact of tax-accounting changes on 1987 earnings.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Webb stock fell $1.25 a share to close at $17.625.    As previously reported, losses in the company's gambling sector could reduce net income by $60 million or &quot;substantially&quot; more for the year. For 1986, Webb reported earnings of $19.6 million, or $2.37 a share, on revenue of $282.2 million in 1986.    Webb currently is making a tender offer to acquire rights to purchase three Nevada hotel-casinos that it once owned. As previously reported, the offer could lead to a $7 million loss because of the assumption of net liabilities and transaction costs.    In 1981, the company omitted its five-cent dividend for two quarters, resuming payouts in July of that year. </TEXT></DOC>
