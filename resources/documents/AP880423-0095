RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Not yet six months old, guidelines designed toproduce uniformity in sentencing federal convicts are promptingwidespread dissatisfaction among the judges who have to impose theprison terms.   Judges are complaining about being turned into ``accountants,''barred from using their judicial experience, discretion andintuition.   ``My general reaction is that they're unwieldy andtime-consuming,'' said U.S. District Judge Thomas Ballantine Jr. ofLouisville, Ky. He suggested the goal of the new rules, to make thepunishment fit the crime, will not always be met.   ``I question whether a fellow who goes into a bank intending toget $50,000 and comes away with $500 is any less culpable than thefellow who got the whole $50,000,'' he said.   The National Association of Criminal Lawyers last month endorseda challenge to the guidelines filed by a woman who must receive a6{-year sentence in Florida for cocaine smuggling although she hasno previous record.   There have also been other court challenges to the sentencingguidelines, with varying results, according to NACL officials.   The guidelines are ``cold and implacable and as immutable as acomputer,'' said James Ideman, a federal trial judge in Los Angeleswho was one of 20 judges who met last week in Pasadena to discusstheir concerns over the guidelines.   But other judges among several interviewed by The AssociatedPress said there is enough leeway to suit the aims of justice.   ``We could still go above or below the guidelines by citing thespecial circumstances of certain cases,'' said Judge Howard Munsonof Syracuse, N.Y. ``I'd like to see how it works first.''   Judge Thomas A. Wiseman Jr. of Nashville, Tenn., said hiscolleagues are ``virtually unanimous'' in believing the guidelineswill need a major overhaul.   Wiseman, vice president of the Federal Judges Association, saidone problem is limits placed on use of probation.   Wiseman said probation works for the overwhelming majority ofinmates who receive it as an alternative to doing time.   Citing his own judicial district in Tennessee as an example,Wiseman said only 7 percent of those convicted criminals givenprobation since 1981 are accused of committing new crimes orviolating their probation.   ``This tells me that supervised probation makes social goodsense because over 93 percent of these people are rehabilitated,''he said.   The probation system could yield savings nationwide fortaxpayers of $2 billion a year, Wiseman said, but he added that thesystem is threatened by the new sentencing guidelines.   The guidelines, adopted under a federal law and applying topeople convicted of crimes after Nov. 1, are expected to increasethe prison population by 10 percent in the next decade.   Federal prisons now hold more than 42,000 inmates, a 75 percentjump since 1980.   The guidelines increase prison terms for robbery, fraud,forgery, drug violations and a host of other crimes.   And for the first time, federal judges are required to imposeprison terms for many white-collar criminals. For example,corporate executives convicted of antitrust offenses such asprice-fixing must serve prison terms. Only 28 percent of thoseconvicted of antitrust crimes were being sent to prison previously.   Federal appeals court Judge William Wilkins, who headed thecommission that drew up the guidelines, said a main objective is toconvince the public the criminal justice system is fair.   ``There's a feeling in America that the white-collar criminal isable to steal with a pencil and get away with it while the18-year-old kid who steals with a gun goes to prison for a longtime,'' he says. ``There's something unfair and inequitable aboutthat system. We're going to change it.''   But critics contend the new rules try to impose mathematicalprecision on cases that demand individual attention.   There are 43 different categories for all federal crimes, andthe length of a prison term is determined by the type of crime andthe defendant's prior criminal record.   Minimum and maximum penalties at each level do not vary morethan 25 percent, and judges are barred from deviating unless thecase involves factors not considered by the commission that draftedthe guidelines.   ``These guidelines have turned us almost into accountants,''said a judge in New Jersey who requested anonymity. ``I want tolook a guy in the eye and say, `I believe in you. I've looked hardat your case and I think you can make it.'''   The guidelines also face a constitutional attack by federalpublic defender groups who say Congress improperly delegatedlegislative duties to a judicial body, the commission that drew upthe guidelines.   It is likely to take several years for that lawsuit to reach theSupreme Court for final resolution.</TEXT></DOC>
