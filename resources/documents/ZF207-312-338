1.2MB floppy disk drive; integral VGA support; serial, parallel,and mouse ports; 1MB RAM; $2,699.andP;  Model 20, with 20MB hard disk, $3,399.andO;Model 40, with 40MB hard disk, $3,999.andM;In Short: Compaq's new Deskpro 286e provides solid, yeoman-like performancefor your general business applications.andM;The Compaq Deskpro 286e reflects the massive changes the PC industry has seenin just a short time.andP;  Three years ago this 12-MHz desktop would have beenconsidered a thundering hot rod.andP;  Today, midrange AT-class machines like thisare the absolute minimum necessary in many offices.andP;  Let's face it, thesemachines are to the '80s what electric typewriters were to the '60s.andM;The 286e will compete in the relatively low-tech market for basic 286e, whereIBM and Compaq no longer dominate as completely as they once did.andO;Budget-conscious managers seek the same qualities in their ATs that they lookfor in any other kind of basic office equipment.andP;  They want solidperformance, strong support, and no surprises when it comes to compatibility.andM;Compaq aims the Deskpro 286e straight at those needs.andP;  The machine'sperformance has been deliberately throttled back in order to guarantee thecompatibility that Compaq's reputation is founded on.andM;When we ran the PC Labs benchmark tests on the Deskpro 286e, the resultspegged the machine's clock speed at 11.8 MHz, rather than at the 12 MHz thatCompaq reports.andP;  However, the 286e is, in fact, a 12-MHz system.andP;  Compaq'sdesign philosophy accounts for the discrepancy and is consistent withCompaq's earlier offerings: all of the company's 12-MHz machines show thesame test results.andM;The 286e's memory refresh cycle runs at 8 MHz, in the interest of assuringcompatibility with expansion-bus add-in hardware.andP;  I/O operations on theexpansion bus involve DMA (direct memory access), and Compaq opted to keepDMA running at a pace unlikely to conflict with anything that would haveworked in the expansion bus of an 8-MHz IBM PC AT.andP;  The net effect is slowerperformance.andP;  Processor speed can be toggled between 8 and 12 MHz.andM;Compaq reports that its decision to slow memory performance is in theinterest of preserving compatibility.andP;  Many PC add-in cards (older ones inparticular) choke at speeds at or around 12 MHz, and Compaq's engineeringdecision means that such problems are unlikely to occur.andM;That warm feeling of compatibility comes at a definite price, however.andP;  The286e performs solidly but unspectacularly in our tests.andP;  On the 80286Instruction Mix test, it clocks in at 6.04 seconds.andP;  if the 286e had beenincluded in our last round-up of 12-MHz ATs, that result would have placed itdead last among the 13 machines we reviewed (see &quot;Crowd Pleasers: Entry-Level12-MHz 286s,&quot; PC Magazine, January 31, 1989).andM;In the same company, the 286e also finishes last on the 128K NOP loop test,which is a basic test of raw processor performance.andP;  The Deskpro's2.85-second time puts it only a few hundredths behind a group of ATs thatclocked in at 2.80 seconds.andP;  But it lags more than a tenth of a second behindseveral machines, like the ALR Dart 12.5 Model 30 and the Zeos 286/12.andM;On the DOS File Access test for small records, the 286e, like a number ofother machines, performs slower than an original IBM PC AT.andP;  Here it shouldbe noted, however, that only four of the systems we tested in the 12-MHzroundup managed to outrun the original AT on this test.andP;  On the DOS FileAccess test for large records, the 286e's performance would have placed itamong the fastest machines in that group.andM;The physical design of the Deskpro 286e incorporates plenty of flexibilityand room for expansion in its small-footprint (5.9- by 15.8- by 14.8-inch,HWD) case.andP;  One megabyte of memory is standard, and additional RAM can beinstalled in a single proprietary 16-bit slot reserved for memory expansion.andO;The 286e accepts a total of up to 13MB of RAM.andM;Since the memory slot takes care of any needed RAM upgrades, the fourindustry-standard slots are all available for whatever upgrade options theuser decides to install.andP;  Those slots seem like more than enough growingspace when you consider all of the electronics that Compaq integrates intothe Deskpro's motherboard.andP;  The VGA adapter and the hard and floppy diskcontrollers are integral, as are one serial port, one parallel port, and amouse port.andM;The 286e accepts up to four internal storage devices.andP;  Our review unit camewith two floppy disk drives and a tape drive, all half-height, mounted one ontop of the other in a single cutout in the case's front panel.andP;  It also hadan internal 40MB hard disk, which was rated at 29 milliseconds but performedat 27 ms.andP;  Compaq offers disk up to 110MB in size.andM;The Deskpro's 140-watt power supply should be adequate for the four-slotexpansion bus.andP;  Compaq keeps power consumption down by using CMOS technologyto a considerable extent in the 286e.andM;Compaq's new Deskpro may be aimed at a stiffly competitive market, but thecompany clearly has chosen not to compete on price.andP;  Compaq'sindustry-leading reputation for quality, compatibility, and support commandsa pretty penny.andP;  The basic Deskpro 286e Model 1 carries a moderate lust priceof $2,699.andP;  That includes the standard 1MB of memory, VGA support (nomonitor), a single 1.2MB floppy disk drive, and no hard disk.andM;The Model 20, at $3,399, adds a 20MB hard disk.andP;  $3,999 buys you the Model40, which beefs up the package with a 40MB hard disk drive.andM;It's a bit unfair to criticize Compaq's price structure by comparing it withthe discount prices offered by some competitors.andP;  Compaq sells more than theraw performance of its products; users expect a higher degree of reliabilityand service from Compaq than from most other vendors.andM;In that light, the Deskpro 286e is consistent with previous Compaq offerings.andO;It is not a standout performer among its 12-MHz brethren, but it is acapable, well-engineered system.andP;  It provides the flexibility, power, andcompatibility that many users find indispensable.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
