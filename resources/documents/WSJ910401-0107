It is the first such challenge of a trade ruling since theU.S.-Canada free trade agreement took effect Jan. 1, 1989.</LP><TEXT>   The appeal will be heard by a judicial panel, known as anExtraordinary Challenge Committee, consisting of retiredCanadian and U.S. judges.   &quot;In Canada's view, there are no grounds for anextraordinary challenge in this case,&quot; said Trade MinisterJohn Crosbie. The U.S. decision to exercise its right to achallenge &quot;doesn't accord with the letter and the spirit&quot; ofthe free trade agreement, he said. Under the trade agreement,such challenges are permitted only on grounds of grossmisconduct, serious procedural violations or abuse ofjurisdiction.   The challenge in the pork trade case concerns a Jan. 22ruling by a panel of U.S. and Canadian trade experts. Suchpanels are now routinely established to deal with U.S. andCanadian trade differences, as provided for in theU.S.-Canada trade agreement. In the pork case, the panel ofexperts held that the U.S. International Trade Commissionhadn't supported with adequate evidence a finding thatCanadian pork shipments to the U.S. were threatening toinjure the U.S. pork industry. As a result of the panel'sruling, the commission on Feb. 12 reversed its injurydecision, clearing the way for the lifting of athree-cent-a-pound U.S. countervailing duty on Canadian porkimports.   The U.S. National Pork Producers Council, an industrygroup, claimed that the trade panel, in its ruling, hadexceeded its jurisdiction and asked for a review of thefinding by an Extraordinary Challenge Committee. The request,supported by 89 U.S. congressmen, was granted by U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills.   The challenge will be heard by three retired Canadian andU.S. judges selected from a roster previously designated bythe U.S. and Canadian governments. Canada and the U.S. willeach select one member from the roster and the two so namedwill then select the third. If necessary, the third may beselected by lot.   The judges' decision in the pork case is expected to berendered within 30 days. It will be binding on the twogovernments.   The pork case is the biggest trade issue to be handled bythe dispute settlement procedures of the free tradeagreement. Canada exports pork products valued at about $305million to the U.S. a year, or about 3% of U.S. consumption.   Canadian officials claimed that in the pork case the U.S.was abusing the free trade pact's appeal procedures. The U.S.decision to grant an extraordinary challenge of the porkruling represents &quot;a setback not only to the Canadianindustry but to the free trade agreement, which depends uponmutual respect for the objective decision making processcontained in the agreement,&quot; said Canadian AgricultureMinister Don Mazankowski.</TEXT></DOC>
