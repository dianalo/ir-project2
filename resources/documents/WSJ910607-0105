Tate, a top merchant banker atMorgan Stanley Group Inc., resigned from the securitiescompany after 20 years to open a New York office for Hicks,Muse andamp; Co.   As part of the resignation, Mr. Tate today will also giveup four positions he attained through his merchant-bankingactivities. He was chairman of Cullum Cos., Dallas; presidentof Coltec Holdings Inc., formerly Colt Industries Inc.; and adirector of Waterford Wedgwood PLC, Ireland, and Cargo VanG.m.b.H., Germany.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Tate, 46 years old, was one of five managing directorsin Morgan Stanley's big and profitable merchant-bankingoperation, through which the firm holds equity stakes in morethan 40 companies with total assets of $25 billion. Theoperation was split off into a separate division a year ago.   In an interview, Mr. Tate said his departure was unrelatedto Morgan Stanley's management changes over the past year orits tarnished image in recent months over certain lucrativebut troubled merchant-banking deals, such as the 1987takeover of Burlington Industries Inc.   &quot;It has nothing to do with Morgan,&quot; Mr. Tate said of hisresignation. If the Hicks Muse job didn't come up, &quot;I'd haveplayed the string out at Morgan another 10 to 15 years or howlong they wanted to keep me.&quot;   A Morgan Stanley spokesman said: &quot;Charles has been alongstanding member of our team, and we wish him the best inhis new undertaking.&quot;   Among other deals at Morgan Stanley, Mr. Tate was anadviser to Grand Metropolitan PLC in its takeover ofPillsbury and to Texaco Inc. in its negotiations withPennzoil Co. Mr. Tate also helped build up Morgan Stanley'sleveraged buy-out capability in Germany; the acquisition in1990 of Cargo Van was Morgan Stanley's first investment inGermany and only its second in Europe.   Hicks Muse is a Dallas-based firm specializing inleveraged buy-outs. Mr. Tate said he has known ChairmanThomas O. Hicks for some time, &quot;and we've talked aboutwhether we could craft something that fits his aspirationsfor his firm. . . . We had a shared vision.&quot; Mr. Tate will bea partner and managing director at Hicks Muse.   Mr. Tate said that despite the recent merchant-banking&quot;train wrecks&quot; that have given LBOs a bad name, he believesthat the business isn't dead. &quot;Deals will be made {because}sellers' price expectations have come down. That's not truenecessarily for the stock market,&quot; said Mr. Tate. He addedthat he's in the early stages of raising an LBO fund at HicksMuse.</TEXT></DOC>
