Michel Aoun said Friday his Christiantroops will attack Syrian supply routes in retaliation for theshelling of a tanker carrying gasoline destined for Lebanon'sbesieged Christian enclave.   Syrian artillery fire set the tanker ablaze Thursday evening asit approached the Christian port of Tabarja, 15 miles north ofBeirut.   ``Roads leading to capitals of occupation (forces) will not besafe henceforth,'' Aoun said in a statement broadcast by governmentradio. ``We shall confront this foreign enemy with the courage of awarrior at the front.''   Syria's 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon receive supplies over anetwork of roads from Damascus, the Syrian capital about 50 mileseast of Beirut.   Attacks on the roads would be a dramatic escalation of the3-month-old confrontation between Aoun's forces and a Moslemalliance of the Syrians and Druse militiamen, which has largelyconsisted of artillery duels.   At least 372 people have been killed and 1,450 wounded since thefighting began March 8, two days after Aoun's Christian army unitsblockaded illegal ports operated by Moslem militias.   The general describes the Syrians as an occupation force and hasdeclared a ``war of liberation.'' President Hafez Assad of Syria hashad soldiers in Lebanon since 1976, the year after the Lebanesecivil war began, under a peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.   Christian gunners have shelled the supply routes several times inrecent weeks, mainly in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of eastLebanon. Aoun did not say what other methods of attack he might use,but commando raids, land mines and car bombs are among thepossibilities.   Syrian forces have blockaded the 310-square-mile enclave where 1million Christians live since the early days of the confrontation,and shell the Christian-held coast north of Beirut to stop suppliesarriving by sea.   Aoun's gunboats tried in vain to salvage some of the 660,000gallons of gasoline from the tanker. The vessel still was burning onFriday.   Gunboats rescued 13 of the 14 crew members after they abandonedship and the other man is missing and presumed dead, police reported.   Syrian shellfire destroyed fuel depots in the Christian enclaveMarch 30, creating a fuel shortage that has grown more acute.   Dozens of small cargo ships carrying supplies and weaponsprovided by Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, have reached Christianports successfully but others either have been hit by Syrian fire orturned back because of it.   The tanker was shelled several hours after three Lebanese cargovessels used to run food supplies to the Christians were blown up inthe port of Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.   Sidon is predominantly Sunni Moslem. The Sunnis have stayed outof the fighting and merchants in Sidon have been shipping food tothe Christian ports by night.   A cease-fire proclaimed by the Arab League in April has beenviolated regularly.   Lebanon's government and army have been split on sectarian linessince a political crisis arose last September.   At the United Nations in New York on Friday, Lebanon protestedIsraeli air raids, even as Israel conducted another raid against aPalestinian guerrilla base.   Lebanon's permanent U.N. representative, Rachid Fakhoury,protested a raid on Wednesday against Bshamun, southeast of Beirut,in which he said several people were killed or wounded.   Israeli warplanes Friday attacked targets at Rashidiyeh, Lebanon.Police said two children were wounded in a house near the beachsideguerrilla base of Palestinian terrorist leader Abu Nidal'sFatah-Revolutionary Council.</TEXT></DOC>
