The Times, established in 1865, has a circulation of just under25,000, according to the 1989 Editor andamp; Publisher yearbook. The Newsand Observer has a circulation of about 140,000 daily, 185,000Sundays.   Daniels said he made the decision to close the Times afterstudying a report compiled by an internal task force that reviewedcirculation patterns, reader preferences and publishing industrytrends.   ``The recommendation to cease publication of The Raleigh Timeswas one that was accepted reluctantly, but it was not unexpected,''he said. ``For several years, we have watched as afternoon dailiesin metropolitan areas closed.''   Daniels said most of the task force recommendations ``weredirected toward making The News and Observer a better and morecomplete newspaper.'' Many of those improvements could not be madeas long as the Times was being published.</TEXT></DOC>
