Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AM </CO><IN> SCR </IN><G> SEC </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Securities and Exchange Commission settled with one of the defendants in a case involving allegedly false financial statements issued by AM International Inc.    Edgar Bolton, former president of AM's Jacquard division, entered into a consent decree under which he neither admitted nor denied the SEC's allegations, and agreed to refrain from violating certain securities laws in the future.    As part of the settlement, Mr. Bolton agreed to submit to further SEC discovery -- information-gathering procedures -- in its related actions against certain other former AM International executives, and against Price Waterhouse and three of that accounting firm's partners.    Mr. Bolton couldn't be reached for comment. Both his attorney and AM International, a Chicago-based maker of business graphics equipment, declined to comment.    Allen Young, an associate general counsel of Price Waterhouse, said the firm is vigorously contesting the SEC's civil suit. Asked if Mr. Bolton's settlement might affect Price Waterhouse's case, Mr. Young said: &quot;We're not concerned about anything Mr. Bolton has to say about us.&quot;    In 1985, the SEC charged Price Waterhouse and three of its partners with securities laws violations in connection with an unqualified opinion they gave to AM International's fiscal 1980 financial statement. The SEC alleged the statement was materially false and misleading; Price Waterhouse officials responded that the SEC's charges were unjustified and resulted from second-guessing a difficult audit.    According to the SEC, Mr. Bolton helped falsify AM International's statements in several ways. At his direction, the agency said, his division's books were routinely kept open at the end of the month to record revenue for later shipments.    In addition, the SEC said, Mr. Bolton knew officials of his division offered favorable terms to foreign distributors that effectively made some sales into consignment sales, yet those transactions were recorded as normal sales. As a result, AM's pretax operating results for fiscal 1980 were overstated by about $3 million, the SEC said. </TEXT></DOC>
