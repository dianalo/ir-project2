The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 2158.61, up 27.03 points from Friday and more than six points above its previous post-crash high of 2152.20, set June 22.    Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 171.8 million shares, down from 238.3 million shares Friday, as trading resumed after the Independence Day holiday. Advancing issues outnumbered losers 934 to 523.    Broader market averages also reached post-crash highs. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 4.03 to 275.81, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.89 to 155.57.    After a lackluster morning dominated by the slipping bond market, program buying moved stock prices ahead as stock-index futures rose to sharp premiums over the cash market.    Oil stocks rebounded from last week's sell-off amid uncertainty about the impact of the U.S. Navy's downing of an Iranian passenger jet on the supply of oil through the Persian Gulf. Traders said bargain hunting also played a role in the buying, as investors took advantage of prices that had been driven lower by a drop in oil prices last week.    Analysts said strength in the dollar continued to be the primary underpinning for the market, easing concern that the Federal Reserve will move to restrict the money supply any time soon and helping to make U.S. stocks more attractive to foreign investors.    &quot;As long as interest rates aren't skyrocketing due to tightening monetary policy, stocks will go up,&quot; said Joseph J. McAlinden, director of research at Dillon Read.    He added that despite fears of recession, the U.S. economy is still strong. As evidence, he pointed to the strong corporate earnings that are expected to be reported for the latest quarter and a survey of industrial purchasing managers that indicated that the economy grew last month at its greatest rate since last December.    &quot;That means companies are making a lot of money, and that's good for stocks,&quot; Mr. McAlinden said, noting that the stock market managed to advance despite the weakness in bonds that would ordinarily push stock prices lower.    &quot;The momentum in stocks is a reflection of an underlying trend that will be prevailing over the next several months,&quot; he said. &quot;The summer rally is going to continue.&quot;    Alfred E. Goldman, market analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, St. Louis, says that with the loss of support from the bond market, stocks are set for a pullback.    &quot;If there is a pullback in the dollar, accompanied by a pullback in bonds, that would pull the rug out from under the stock market,&quot; he said. &quot;If the market can ignore these factors, then the summer rally could be extended.&quot;    But Mr. Goldman said he doesn't expect the rally to continue for more than another couple of weeks, with the Dow Jones industrials falling short of the 2200 level before a downturn in the dollar sends stocks lower.    Phil Eagan, manager of equity trading at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., said the days of the stock market's summer rally are numbered.    &quot;I suspect that stocks will run out of steam rather quickly,&quot; he said. &quot;My concern is that the sell-off in bonds is showing the right direction.&quot;    The Dow Jones industrials benefited substantially from the gains in the oil sector. Chevron jumped 2 to 47 1/4, Exxon rose 1 1/4 to 45 7/8, Texaco gained 1/2 to 47 1/8, and USX advanced 1 to 32 5/8. Among other oil issues, Mobil rose 1 1/8 to 44 1/2, Amoco went up 1 to 73 3/8, and Atlantic Richfield advanced 2 1/4 to 82 5/8. Sun, which reached an agreement to acquire the assets of Atlantic Petroleum for $513 million, gained 2 1/4 to 55 5/8.    Along with bargain hunting, traders said the group benefited from comments by Shearson Lehman Hutton oil analyst Sanford L. Margoshes, who repeated his positive stance on oil issues. Mr. Margoshes told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that he believes the recent decline in oil prices has just about run its course.    Raychem, whose Raynet unit introduced a fiber-optic-based telecommunications system for use by local telephone companies, surged 3 3/4 to 53 1/4. Nynex, Ameritech and BellSouth will be conducting field trials on the system next year, Raychem said, and Raynet has received a $30 million, multiyear contract to adapt the system for a pilot project in West Germany.    Gerber Products rose 1 3/8 to 44 7/8. The company said it expects to report earnings from continuing operations of 90 cents a share for the first quarter ended June 30, compared with 38 cents a share a year earlier. It attributed the rise to increased baby-food sales.    Tandy dropped 2 to 45 3/4. Dean Witter Reynolds lowered its investment rating on the stock and may reduce its estimate of the company's 1988 and 1989 earnings, the investor report said.    Morgan Products slid 1 3/4 to 21 1/4. The company said it expects profits for the first half of 1988 to be significantly lower than a year ago because of lower-than-expected sales volume and costs associated with labor disputes and new projects.    Freeport-McMoRan Resources advanced 2 to 25 3/4. The partnership declared a cash distribution of 80 cents a unit, 20 cents higher than its announced minimum. The dividend reflects the strong second-quarter performance by its fertilizer business, it said.    Oneok jumped 1 1/8 to 17 3/4. The company said it agreed in principle to settle a $106.2 million gas-purchase contract dispute brought by Damson Oil against its Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. unit. The settlement amount wasn't disclosed. The company's natural gas unit has been locked in several breach-of-contract disputes since last year.    The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.59 to 309.59, topping the previous post-October high of 309.33, set June 30. Volume totaled 11,510,000 shares, up from 9,030,000 Friday. There were 260 issues advancing, 311 declining and 260 unchanged.    Visual Graphics Class B dropped 1 3/4 to 9 1/8. The company said it was advised that a prospective acquirer, which it didn't identify, was unable to obtain financing for a proposed $13-a-share takeover offer.    Schwab Safe, which received a sweetened bid of $18.25 a share from a management group, rose 3/4 to 18 1/8. The group had originally offered $17.25 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
