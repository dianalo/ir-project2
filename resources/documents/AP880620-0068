The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that sheilded thestate from making such expenditures.   The controversy has its roots in a 1955 lawsuit over racialsegregation in Nashville schools.   Until the Supreme Court's landmark 1954 decision outlawingracial segregation in public schools, Tennessee law barred blackand white children from attending the same schools.   In 1960, the Metropolitan County Board of Education of Nashvilleand Davidson County was substituted as a defendant in the case.   In 1981, the local school board asked a federal judge to requireTennessee to pay the full cost of implementing court-ordereddesegregation remedies, which include extensive busing.   U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Wiseman Jr. ruled in 1985 thatforcing Tennessee to pay for ``costs already sustained'' before theschool board filed its complaint in 1981 would violate theConstitution's 11th Amendment giving states broad protectionsagainst being sued.   But Wiseman ruled that the 11th Amendment does not shield thestate from helping pay for continuing desegregation efforts.   He ordered Tennessee officials ``to assume 60 percent of thecosts directly attributable to Metro's desegregation program fromand after ... March 16, 1981.''   Tennessee appealed, arguing that it should not have to payanything. The local school district also appealed, contending thatthe state should have to pay all desegregation costs.   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the state lastDec. 30.   ``The federal courts would not be justified in shifting any ofthe costs in question from Metro (the local school district) to thestate of Tennessee,'' the appeals court said.   The Supreme Court in 1977 ruled that Michigan could be forced tohelp pay the costs of desegregating Detroit's public schools.   But the 6th Circuit court said there is a difference between theDetroit case and the Nashville case.   ``The monetary relief granted in (the Detroit case) was merelyancilliary to other affirmative relief,'' the appeals court said,``and the monetary relief granted here is not.''   It noted that Michigan officials had been ordered to help putsome desegregation programs into effect, not merely pay forprograms undertaken by the Detroit school authorities.   The appeals court said Tennessee's duty to eliminate thevestiges of past segregation in education ``was discharged longbefore Metro filed its ... complaint against the state.''   The case is Metropolitan County Board vs. Tennessee, 87-1774.</TEXT></DOC>
