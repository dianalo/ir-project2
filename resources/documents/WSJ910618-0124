The move could curtail sales to minors and havefar-reaching implications for other retailers.   The 109-store chain, based in Waltham, Mass., made thedecision as part of its settlement of a precedent-settinglawsuit brought in 1987 by anti-smoking activists. The suitalleged that Theresa Kyte, age 12, and Sean Cann, age 15,repeatedly purchased Philip Morris Cos.' Marlboro andParliament brands at Store 24 in violation of a statuteprohibiting the sale of tobacco to minors. As a result, theyoungsters, both now adults, became addicted to nicotine, thesuit charged. No retailer had ever been named as a defendantin a tobacco-liability case before.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This was our test case to see whether the strategy {ofbringing suit} to get stores to stop selling cigarettes tokids would actually work,&quot; said Richard Daynard, chairman ofthe Tobacco Product Liability Project, which encouragesplaintiffs to bring suits against tobacco marketers. Mr.Daynard says his organization will now try to apply thestrategy to other chains in Massachusetts and will encourageanti-smoking groups around the nation to bring similarlitigation.   The Store 24 settlement will be announced today in Bostonby Mr. Daynard's organization, which sponsored the lawsuitalong with the Group Against Smoking Pollution. RobertGordon, president of Store 24, which had sales of about $100million last year, said his closely held chain has agreed tomake no public comment about the settlement.   Forty-two states and the District of Columbia have lawsprohibiting the sale of tobacco to people under 18 years old.Some convenience-store operators contacted yesterday saidthey are determined to enforce them more stringently, thoughthey insisted that had nothing to do with the Store 24settlement.   Southland Corp., the nation's largest convenience-storechain, requires sales clerks at its 7-Eleven outlets to askfor proper identification anytime a consumer appears to beunder age 26. Failure to do so can result in an employee'sdismissal. But the Dallas-based chain concedes that untilnow, carding at its 6,200 U.S. outlets has been sporadic.   (Mr. Daynard estimates that when anti-smoking activistssend 11- and 12-year-olds into conveinence stores around thecountry, more than 70% are sold cigarettes with no questionsasked.)   &quot;There is so much culture associated with asking foridentification when it comes to alcohol products that peopledon't necessarily think about asking for it with cigarettes,&quot;says Don Cowan, a Southland spokesman. &quot;Our clerks aretrained to do it, but when I ask people at our corporateheadquarters, have you ever seen anyone carded {for tobacco},they say, `Goodness no, I don't remember.'&quot;   As a result, Southland is now seeking to step up itstobacco-related sales-training and consumer-awarenessactivities. It plans a meeting tomorrow to decide whether toadopt a program developed by the National Association ofConvenience Stores called &quot;It's the Law,&quot; which encouragesstore operators to treat tobacco purchases to minors justlike alcohol purchases. Alternatively, Southland says it willexpand its own in-house &quot;Come of Age&quot; program beyond itscurrent focus on alcohol to cigarettes and lottery tickets.   The Tobacco Products Liability Project claims to havedevised a plan for monitoring whether Store 24 keeps itspledge. But the organization wouldn't divulge any specifics,citing the confidentiality of its settlement agreement withthe chain. The group's Mr. Daynard said: &quot;We have confidencethat what they have promised to do will happen, but we willcertainly be keeping an eye on them.&quot;   Tobacco companies contacted yesterday wouldn't confirmestimates of anti-smoking activists that 5% of all cigarettesare bought by minors. But they said they were in favor ofattempts to tighten controls on sales to minors. &quot;We havenever held any position but that cigarette smoking is foradults only, and any move to futher prevent minors fromgetting them is a good one,&quot; a Philip Morris spokesman said.   Philip Morris originally was a defendant in the Store 24suit. But in 1990, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Courtgranted summary judgment in favor of Philip Morris,dismissing claims that the tobacco giant should be liable forthe selling of its cigarettes to minors by conveniencestores.</TEXT></DOC>
