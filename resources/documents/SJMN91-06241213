But morethan a dozen inmates remained on the roof as clouds of smoke drifted away.There were no reports of injuries.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  INMATES SAY HOSTAGES ARE FACING STARVATIONCUBAN PRISONERS DEFY EFFORTS AT DEPORTATION  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The explosives were &quot;non-lethal dispersals used only after the Cubans threwprojectiles at staff,&quot; federal prison system spokesman Greg Bogdan said. Hesaid tear gas wasn't used, but wouldn't comment further.;   It was the firsttime inmates had been seen since hostages were taken in a rebellion Aug. 21inside the high-security &quot;Alpha&quot; unit at Talladega Federal CorrectionalInstitution.;   Inside the unit are 121 Cuban inmates, 18 non-Cuban inmatesand the 10 hostages, seven men and three women who work at the prison. TheCubans were ordered deported for committing crimes in the United States afterarriving in the 1980 Mariel boatlift. Some have said they would rather diethan be sent back to Cuba.;   'Freedom or death'; The inmates on the unit'sroof waved a Cuban flag and posted handwritten signs. Seen from a distancethrough high-powered lenses, the signs said, &quot;We have not been fed for a week,the hostages are dying due to the lack of food&quot;; &quot;We want the world to know&quot;;and &quot;Please, media -- justice, freedom or death.&quot;;   Prison officials wouldn'tsay how the inmates gained access to the roof.;   The officials confirmedearlier that food has been withheld from the occupied cellblock since theuprising began.;   Authorities have kept a tight lid on information about thesiege. But late Tuesday the prison system spokesman, Bogdan, said FBInegotiators and the Cuban detainees had &quot;their first extensive face-to-facenegotiating session&quot; earlier in the day. No time was set for another session,he said.;   Earlier, prison warden Roger F. Scott said a group of Cubaninmates faked a breakout from the unit Monday night, apparently to test theresponse of security forces.;   Little food inside; Scott also had said thehostages are probably safe, despite concerns they are being starved along withtheir captors inside a prison unit.;   Prison officials said they would takeprecautions to avoid harming any Cuban detainees leaving the occupiedbuilding. Guards near the unit are armed only with batons; officers along theperimeter carry guns. The prison officials said it may be difficult for someto surrender if others don't want to.;   Bogdan confirmed that inmates andhostages had no food except the apparent small amounts stockpiled in lockers.;  &quot;No food has gone into that unit as of today,&quot; Bogdan said Tuesdayafternoon.;   Bogdan has said food, water and electricity are part of thenegotiating process. He said six hostages have been seen by health-careworkers, who continued making daily contact in delivering medication toinmates, apparently through a grille. Officials have declined to say if theyhave cameras or other surveillance equipment inside the occupied building, orhow they know the four other hostages are unharmed, other than the word oftheir captors.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Talladega, Ala.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910828  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  563  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, August 28, 199100241213,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
