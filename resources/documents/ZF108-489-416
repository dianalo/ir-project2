 Centralized decision-making applications will requirethis data to be drawn from across the organization into a centralizedrepository.andP;  The information in the central repository may be used to supportcorporationwide financial-planning applications, production-managementsystems and other strategically important applications.andM;To build these large, strategic systems, corporations are increasingly takingan organizationwide view of database resources and information modeling.andO;They view information as a key business resource that must be managedproperly to gain strategic advantage; however, to gain access to thisinformation, it is necessary to provide an integrated data store and datamodel.andM;Corporationwide Data AccessandM;The figure illustrates a problem facing many organizations attempting toimplement an integrated data store.andP;  Through the years, the various divisionsof a corporation may have committed to a wide range of hardware and softwareenvironments to support their different operational requirements.andO;Manufacturing divisions may be using Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  VAX computersin the VMS environment for shop-floor control operations.andP;  R-and-D facilitiesmay be using engineering workstations and RISC machines running under avariety of Unix operating systems.andP;  Business-oriented applications may beoperating on IBM PCs, RTs, AS/400s and S/370 mainframes.andM;Each of these hardware and software environments may use a differentdatabase-management system.andP;  All of these systems may have been selected asan optimal solution for a local processing problem; however, the variety ofincompatible systems operating within a large organization makes it extremelydifficult to implement corporationwide applications.andM;Corporationwide database access has been greatly simplified through the useof the relational data model and the Structured Query Language (SQL) for dataaccess and retrieval.andP;  Unfortunately, SQL is not appropriate for direct useby end users.andP;  SQL syntax is arcane, and even logically simple queries canresult in a set of convoluted statements.andP;  The remedy is not to abandon SQL,but to introduce a better interface to the language.andM;Natural-language interfaces, simple verbs and graphical front ends are beingused as interfaces to SQL.andP;  With a natural-language interface, queries arespecified in a conversational language, such as English, and thenautomatically translated into the corresponding SQL statements.andP;  Likewise,the verbs used for data access in the Common Programming Interface (CPI)within IBM's Systems Application Architecture (SAA) translate into SQLstatements.andP;  With a graphical front end, such as that of a computer-aidedsoftware egineering (CASE) tool, the user depicts the data elements andsummarizations graphically with diagrams.andM;Data models implemented across multivendor hardware platforms and supportingserver architectures will be increasingly important.andP;  Products such asOracle, Ingres and Sybase can be used to write applications for widelydiverse hardware environments.andP;  From a corporate vantage point, it isimportant to maintain commonality among these diverse databases at the SQLlevel through the use of ANSI-standard implementations of database-accessproducts.andM;Integrated computing architectures, such as IBM's SAA and Digital's NetworkArchitecture Support (NAS) provide comprehensive support for data access froma distributed network of diverse hardware platforms.andP;  Within SAA, remote dataaccess between networked IBM computers is handled via automatic generation ofcommunication requests using the LU 6.2 peer-to-peer communications protocol.andO;Access of data from non-IBM machines is handled through the automaticgeneration of database-access requests using OSI protocols such as the X.25packet-switching protocol.andP;  These mechanisms enable data to be distributedand accessed from a network of diverse systems, all of which obey an SQLlanguage standard.andM;Akin to the relational data model is the emerging object-oriented data model,in which attributes of the data are stored along with each data element.andO;Object-oriented database-management systems will become increasinglyimportant in the development of advanced artificial-intelligence,expert-system and CASE products.andM;Another problem facing organizations striving to implement global informationsystems is the maintenance of corporationwide data models.andP;  Each divisionwithin a corporation should build applications using a common data model todefine entities, entity relationships, process models and so on.andP;  In thisway, applications built on Digital VAXes, engineering workstations orpersonal computers will share a common pool of design information using astandard repository.andM;One way to ensure compatibility of data models across the corporation is toprovide a central repository of design information, which can be accessed byapplication-development tools on machines anywhere within the network.andP;  Forexample, a CASE tool operating on an engineering workstation may extract anddownload a portion of the centralized data model that is required for thedevelopment of a specific application.andP;  During the development process,additional entities or changes to entity relationships can be defined.andP;  Usingstrict data-administration control procedures, these changes to the localdata model can be incorporated back into the central data model.andM;The AD/Cycle StandardandM;Among a network of IBM machines operating under SAA, the AD/Cycle repositorystandard can be used to maintain consistency of data models across platforms.andO;This standard defines a data metamodel that describes the information storedin the repository.andP;  For a CASE tool, for example, it provides a standarddefinition of the information content of a dataflow diagram, decompositiondiagram or entity-relationship diagram.andP;  If AD/Cycle-compliant CASE tools areused on all platforms, then these platforms will share a common data modelfor application development.andM;Currently, AD/Cycle is still a dream.andP;  No vendor has yet introduced anAD/Cycle-compatible CASE product; however, a large number of leading CASEvendors have committed to the provision of AD/Cycle-compatible products thatcan be used to share design information, as defined by the data metamodel.andM;AD/Cycle-compliant CASE tools are likely to be available for a wide varietyof development platforms, including the IBM PS/2 and RS/6000, Apollo and Sunworkstations and Digital VAXstations.andM;Since no CASE vendor has yet implemented AD/Cycle-compliant repositories, itis unclear whether compliance with AD/Cycle will permit the integration ofCASE tools from multiple vendors.andP;  If application development cannot becoordinated through AD/Cycle, then other mechanisms will have to beconsidered, such as multiple proprietary repositories linked by datainterchange languages, such as CDIF (CASE Data Interchange Format) or ESF(External Source Format).andM;Next week, I will look at major trends in communications software.andM;----------The concepts embodied in this article are described in the High-ProductivityTechnology volume in The James Martin Report Series.andP;
