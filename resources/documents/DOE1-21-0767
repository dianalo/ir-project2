In France 35% of waste are treated in landfill. A landfillsite is a constantly changing system: when buried the waste is subjectto intense biological activity. One of the consequences is the transformationof the organic matter into gaseous products (carbon dioxide and methane).Here like in most of the other countries, landfill gas - LFG - was atfirst an environmental problem. Mostly all the important landfills, speciallyaround Paris, are not far away from residential areas. That's why ANREDwas first involved in landfill gas operations. Methane from landfillwill make a contribution small but a real contribution for the nationalgoal of reducing dependance on foreign sources of oil and natural gas.(Refs. 3).</TEXT></DOC>
