The request for a temporary stay of a Los Angeles ordinance dueto take effect Thursday and a similar measure already in effect inStockton claimed the regulations are pre-empted by state law.   Documents filed with the Supreme Court on behalf of severalindividuals contended California already has a regulatory programgoverning possession of firearms. They also cited a 1982 opinion bythe state attorney general that cities cannot prohibit possession ofhandguns within their municipal areas.   By overruling the Los Angeles and Stockton measures, the petitionsaid the court would ``ensure the effectiveness'' of the state'sfirearms laws against ``unwarranted interference.''   The bans on possession of military style assault rifles wereapproved in the wake of the slaying of five children last month byPartick E. Purdy, who came to a Stockton elementary school andopened fire with an AK-47 semiautomatic weapon.</TEXT></DOC>
