Despite often diverging goals, everyone agrees on the need tostrip the Communists of their 40-year grip on absolute power and tohold the nation's first free elections _ even the Communists.   ``The Communists and their allies keep stealing and adopting ourpositions, to make themselves seem like a new and more trustworthyforce,'' complains Lutheran Pastor Rainer Eppelmann, an oppositionleader.   Unlike its Communist neighbors, the East German opposition hasno major figure like Lech Walesa or Vaclav Havel and no patron likethe Roman Catholic or Protestant churches. East Germany'sbest-known opposition figure is New Forum's Baerbel Bohley, a44-year-old East Berlin artist and painter.   And while Solidarity had years of struggle that also let thePolish opposition fine-tune its platform, East Germany'spro-democracy forces suddenly have been thrown into the breach.   The groups have been operating completely in the open for onlytwo months _ and free elections could be held as early as autumn.Opposition leaders are scheduled to meet the Communists on Dec. 7to discuss the nation's future.   The activists have made a series of sometimes divergent demands.They range from a better environment to a free choice on unity forthe two Germanys. Some disagree on unification and on whether tomake the state-controlled economy more market-oriented.   New Forum is the largest group, with about 200,000 members andmade up in large part of young street protesters. Other groupsinclude the 150-member Greens party, the Social Democrats,Democracy Now and Eppelmann's Demokratische Aufbruch, which meansdemocratic ``start'' or ``awakening.''   Eppelmann, a genial Lutheran cleric in jeans and running shoes,said the country's only hope lies in a multi-party system embracingthe Communists, their allies and the new opposition parties.   ``The established ones can't go it alone, and the new groupscan't do it alone,'' he said. ``There will have to be a grandcoalition of internal reason.''   Just where that coalition would head remains unclear, and evenEppelmann acknowledges it's difficult to say if there is room forall the envisioned participants in the new government.   ``There has to be a pluralistic spectrum of organizations, wherewe can then develop a majority,'' said local New Forum leaderChristoph Poehlmann in East Berlin's Pankow district. ``And therecan only be majorities when there is diversity first.''   But Poehlmann acknowledged: ``The time for just asking questionsis behind us. There is growing support for running candidates.''   Right now, it is uncertain whether the opposition will run asone group or as scattered forces against the Communists.   ``Replacing the Communists with another bloc that lays claim topower and perhaps to truth in a monolithic way is not our goal,''Poehlmann said during a weekend meeting.   In one sense, New Forum, despite massive publicity and support,is having growing pains in changing from a market place for ideasto a true political force.   ``The basic idea of New Forum was to think about what we can doin this country, where can it go? Do we want to be like the West, aconsumer society?'' said New Forum co-founder Luise Schramm. ``Thatprocess continues. In eight weeks, you can't reach conclusions.''   New Forum's leaders want to keep some components of EastGermany's socialist structure, while warning that growing talk ofreunification threatens to derail the reform process in the countryof 16.5 million people.   A public opinion poll published by West Germany's Stern magazinesaid if elections were held now, New Forum would be the winner with22 percent of the vote. The Communists would be in third placebehind the Communist-allied Liberal Democratic party, Stern said.   Mounting an election campaign in a Western sense would be amostimpossible in a country where essentials like typewriters andphotocopying machines are in short supply _ and where the nationaltelephone system seems on the verge of collapse.   The opposition also is likely to find itself being courted _ andperhaps partially co-opted _ by the Communists themselves.   Ingo Klein, a member of New Forum and the Communist Party, saidEast Germany is suffering from a ``lack of new concepts'' thatbrought the opposition into being in the first place.   Klein estimated that 10 percent of New Forum's members belong tothe 2-million strong Communist Party, adding he looks forward to``a government of all the important forces that unite this country.   Klein, a 39-year-old university economist, insists there will beno contradication in his dual membership even when New Forum runscandidates against the Communists.   ``I wouldn't be the servant of two masters,'' he said with asmile, saying he can still support both groups.</TEXT></DOC>
