(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Non-denominational invocationswill be allowed at football games and other extra-curricular eventsin the Okaloosa County school system until the U.S. Supreme Courtrules on the prayer issue.   The school board agreed Tuesday night to settle a lawsuit filedby a Jewish family that objected to prayers at football games. Bothsides said they would await the outcome of a similar case in Georgiathat is expected to go to the Supreme Court.   Board member Jim Harkins Jr., who cast the lone vote against thesettlement, said he objected because prayers in the name of JesusChrist would not be allowed.   ``We can pray in God's name,'' said school board lawyer DavidSelby. ``But we will not pray to Mohammed. We will not pray toBuddha. We will not end a prayer in the name of the Father, the Sonand the Holy Ghost, or in Jesus' name.''   The lawsuit, filed in November 1987, objected to what then wereprimarily Christian prayers offered by Protestant ministers at highschool and junior high football games.   Without the settlement, the case would have gone to trial Feb. 27in U.S. District Court in Pensacola.   The lawsuit was filed by Air Force Master Sgt. Mark Berlin, whois stationed at nearby Eglin Air Force Base, his wife, Jan, andtheir children, Tammy and Max, with the support of the NewYork-based American Jewish Congress.   ``I think both sides got what they wanted,'' said Marc Stern, alawyer for the family. ``We did quite well.''   As part of the settlement, the board agreed to pay $32,000 infees and legal expenses of the Berlins.   A decision last month in a similar case by the 11th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals in Atlanta led to the settlement. A three-judgepanel ruled 2-1 that non-sectarian prayers before public schoolfootball games in Douglas County, Ga., were unconstitutional even ifthey were offered by laymen rather than ministers.   The appeals court ruled the primary purpose of the prayers was toadvance religion, which violated the First Amendment's doctrine ofseparation of church and state and its religious freedom guarantees.   Douglas County school officials have asked for a rehearing beforethe full appeals court, which numbers about 30 judges, and failingthat will appeal to the Supreme Court, Selby said.   He said the case would go to the Supreme Court regardless ofwhich side wins at the appellate level, and it may take up to twoyears to settle the issue.</TEXT></DOC>
