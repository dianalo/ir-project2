Mrs. Joseph, 83, had been reported ``critical and sinking fast''by a family friend Thursday. The Johannesburg General Hospital saidFriday she was in serious condition, but the family had asked thatno further details be released.   For the past three decades it has been illegal to quote Mrs.Joseph in South Africa.   In 1957, Mrs. Joseph received the first of several banningorders, which for 16 of the next 25 years prohibited her fromleaving Johannesburg, attending political meetings, writing forpublication and communicating with other banned people.   In 1962, she became the first South African placed under housearrest, which required her to stay in her cottage north ofJohannesburg from dawn to dusk, report to police daily and visitwith no more than one person at a time.   Born in England in 1905, Helen Fennell came to South Africa fromIndia in 1931, and, as a social worker, began participating inanti-apartheid campaigns at the age of 48.   She helped found the Federation of South African Women, which in1956 staged one of the biggest protests in the country's history _a march by 20,000 black women on the government buildings inPretoria.</TEXT></DOC>
