The Washington, D.C., bank-holding company is now reporting a net loss of $857,000 for the second quarter and a net loss of $145,000 for the six months. The company previously had reported net income of $160,000, or two cents a share, for the quarter, and $872,000, or nine cents a share, for the six months.    The company said &quot;continued deterioration in the consumer-lending portfolio&quot; at its United National Bank unit forced the company to charge off an additional $1 million in loans and increase its loan-loss reserve to $1.4 million. The results also reflect a $235,000 charge for the write-down of assets.    K. Donald Menefee, James Madison's chairman and president, said that &quot;United National's problems will continue to impact (the company) negatively in the near term&quot; but that the company's regulatory capital &quot;exceeds required levels.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
