(February 1991), in a survey of 2,375 MISexecutives, the vast majority admitted that they didn't know enough aboutUNIX to make purchasing decisions about UNIX and its users.andP;  This articlewent on to report that a majority of users said they didn't know whether thestatement &quot;common programming interfaces are the basis of applicationportability&quot; was true or false, and then urged open system champions (ofwhich I am one) to get out and educate both management and end users.andP;  Aneven more telling indication that open systems is new to a large segment ofthe industry was a recent letter to the editor of UNIX TODAY!&quot; claiming thatthe entire tone of the newspaper and UNIX-philes in general is one ofsmugness and insularity, not at all connected to the real world of seriouscomputing.andP;  I have little doubt that is true.andM;The idea of open systems is truly revolutionary and of great benefit to theentire computing industry.andP;  It's not a question of centering on UNIX as somepeople do.andP;  Open systems transcend operating system issues.andP;  It is importantto get the word out.andP;  Back in the early days of computing (the 60s and 70s),operating systems were proprietary products of the hardware vendors.andP;  Thismeans they were written in machine language, highly tailored to one machinearchitecture invented by the vendor.andP;  No two operating systems were alike.andO;Each operating system exported interfaces unique to that system.andP;  Thus,applications were necessarily tied to a given operating system and to a givenvendor.andP;  Opening a file and reading it, writing to a terminal, allocatingspace and creating directions were all different calls on different systems.andO;Applications were inherently not portable and certainly not standard.andM;The impending explosion in computing was not well-understood, even though itwas obvious that a very early prediction about computing had been somewhatoff the mark.andP;  When computing was in its infancy, at the time of the Eniac,it was the opinion of several experts that four or five of these computerswould be enough to satisfy all of the computing requirements for the UnitedStates (with three more for England and one for the Scots).andM;Applications were relatively few then, usually home-grown from theprogramming staffs of each customer or bundled applications from the vendor.andO;New versions of the operating system from a vendor were often a significantamount of work to install.andP;  In addition, at that time every customer modifiedthe operating system to suit his own needs.andP;  So not only did the customerhave to port the applications, he also had to port his operating systemmodifications.andP;  This meant a lot of jobs for a lot of people.andP;  Over time, asthe number of applications in use increased, it started to become too muchwork.andP;  I remember one installation which took three years to move from IBM'sVS to their new MVS operating system, all because of the hundreds ofenhancements they had made to VS and felt required to preserve.andP;  Customersbegan to resist frequent changes to new operating systems.andP;  They also startedto figure out which private changes to operating systems were costly to them.andO;Systems vendors also began to resist shipping operating system source codebecause of the difficulties created by user changes.andM;We still had proprietary systems as the norm in 1980.andP;  During this time, UNIXwas mostly of interest to universities and research installations.andP;  However,it was the first truly portable operating system, written in a high-levellanguage (C).andP;  It was readily available and fairly straightforward to port.andO;In the hands of Berkeley and other universities and research installations,UNIX ports were soon running on a wide assortment of machines.andP;  Theimportance of this was that for the first time you could have the sameoperating system on virtually any machine.andP;  A portable operating system was arevolutionary idea.andM;In the early 80s, a somewhat related phenomenon occurred-the rise of the PC.andO;The PC was a small machine aimed at the home market, with a common CPU, asingle bus, one set of interfaces and was easy to clone (well, fairly easy;those systems that weren't exact clones fell by the wayside).andP;  The PC caughton; you could buy one easily at Computerland.andP;  You could also buy anincreasingly rich array of shrink-wrapped applications to accomplish numberof tasks.andP;  People bought them for the office because they could get work donewithout dealing with large MIS organizations.andP;  The wealth of applicationsincreased and a standard platform was born.andP;  It was inevitable that theinfluence of this experience would transfer itself to larger systems,especially as some of those larger systems were workstations, which werethemselves getting smaller and cheaper.andM;Now we turn to workstations, since that's the arena in which the open systemsmovement exploded.andP;  Workstations came on the scene in the 80s.andP;  ApolloComputer invented the first commercially viable workstation.andP;  Theseworkstations, connected on a local area network, introduced a new paradigmfor computing.andP;  Deskside or desktop, one per user, with powerful CPUs,bit-mapped graphics and network file systems, workstations gave users all theadvantages of timesharing without the contention for CPU cycles.andP;  It gavepeople independent computing and predictable response times without loss offile sharing.andP;  They were the perfect tool for users of CAD/CAM systems andother heavy compute-bound technical users, since you could add an additionaldesigner/engineer without the huge step function of spending a half milliondollars for a new minicomputer.andP;  Workstations were relatively cheap; theywere fairly easy to use.andP;  Technical professionals (especially engineers, inthe beginning) bought lots of them and the workstation industry was born.andO;&quot;One on every desk&quot; became the watchword.andM;The hardware advances in workstations started coming faster and faster astechnology accelerated.andP;  There were large increases in performance-especiallyin price/performance.andP;  Twice the performance at half the cost every two yearswas expected.andP;  This year's &quot;hot box&quot; was always what engineers wanted.andP;  Thereseemed to be no limit to the number of CPU cycles that applications coulduse.andP;  But users started to find themselves locked in because of theapplications they were using and the operating systems the applications werebuilt on.andP;  They couldn't take advantage of the leapfrog game as vendors tookturns outdoing each other in price/performance.andM;It was in this atmosphere that SUN Microsystems developed a brilliantcorporate strategy around openness, portability and standard systems.andP;  Theyunderstood the potential of UNIX as the universal operating system, at leastfor a growing segment of the market in workstations.andP;  So SUN declared thatUNIX was open systems and that UNIX  especially SUN's version) would givecustomers the freedom of choice they wanted.andM;The industry's investment in software was also growing rapidly at this time.andO;Independent software vendors had to maintain different versions of theirapplications for each vendor's box.andP;  Applications writers started selectingfor UNIX ports first.andP;  The operating system's popularity increased, firstselected by the independent software vendors as the primary port, then byvendors to capture the software vendors' applications.andP;  Customers who wantedthe applications heard the &quot;Open systems is UNIX&quot; story.andP;  They also figuredout that a common UNIX environment would make more applications available tothem and free them from the proprietary hold of vendor-specific operatingsystems.andP;  It would free them from being locked in so they could buy thehottest workstation boxes available, as well as maximize the number ofapplications they could choose from.andP;  So UNIX continued to expand itshorizons, and by 1985 all major vendors had it or were planning on offeringit.andP;  Of course, the solution was also the problem--each vendor had a slightlydifferent version of UNIX.andP;  The versions were more like cousins--even secondand third cousins--than identical twins.andP;  While this was a huge step up fromproprietary, pre-vendor operating systems, it still did not fully achieve thecustomer's desire to have interchangeable components and the freedom tochoose.andM;The voices of the workstation customers were a rising crescendo.andP;  People wereaware of the disconnect between the PC world, with its common environment,and the workstation world, with its not-so-common environment.andP;  Vendors heardthe customer message clearly and the open systems movement began in earnest.andO;The POSIX Working Group was formed in 1984, absorbing the work of the earlier&quot;/usr/group&quot; organization (now Uniforum).andP;  X/Open was founded in 1984 by fiveEuropean computer manufacturers.andP;  Each is an organization dedicated todefining and promulgating standards.andP;  POSIX actually creates officialstandards; X/Open more recognizes and blesses choices, though they are alsostarting to invent standard interfaces.andP;  These organizations are supported bythe vendors who, in listening to their customers, commit to implementing thestandards, responding to the cry for commonality.andP;  The important point hereis that no one vendor can go it alone, or can give the customer the opensystems definitions and implementations they need.andM;In the world of open systems, the most important standards are ANSI, POSIXand XPG.andP;  (This is operating system-specific; there are other relatedstandards in graphics, networking, languages, etc.) The idea is to get asingle definition of a set of interfaces and behaviors, dependable andavailable on all &quot;open systems and rich enough to support usefulapplications.andM;A word about the POSIX Working Group, the bedrock effort to achieve anoperating system standards definition.andP;  The POSIX effort is difficultwork-finding common ground, reconciling differences and spending months indebate and esoteric &quot;propeller-head&quot; talk.andP;  Eventually, balloting occurs,and, when successful, the standard is born.andP;  The vendors are committed to theprocess-tracking the emerging standards and implementing them when they'refinal (or close to final).andP;  It should be clear here that POSIX, as does manystandards bodies, provides definitions only (words), not implementations incode.andP;  The implementation the vendors as an exercise.andM;There are other sources of openness besides the formal organizations-defactostandards like X-windows or TCP/IP.andP;  They are not formally legislated but arein common practice and are universally implemented by vendors.andP;  There is adifference between standards (such as ANSI and POSIX) and standardizedproducts (such as MS/DOS) which are implemented by one vendor but are sowidespread as to be considered the standard.andM;The Rise of the Open Software FoundationandM;To produce a UNIX system, vendors almost universally acquire a license fromATandamp;T.andP;  Thus, almost all versions of UNIX have the same roots.andP;  Even thewell-known BSD version requires an ATandamp;T license and represents divergencefrom a common ancestor.andP;  By the mid 80s, as new versions of UNIX wereproduced by ATandamp;T, vendors went back to the well and negotiated new licensesfor the latest version.andP;  It was not a big deal in the early phases of UNIXascendancy.andP;  But after the breakup of ATandamp;T in 1984, the company started topay more attention to this thing they owned called UNIX.andP;  Recognizing thatthey had been giving away something that had real value, they modified thelicensing terms and conditions for System V.3, making them significantly moredifficult and expensive than for previous versions.andP;  This left computervendors grumbling, but with little choice but to negotiate a license.andM;Remember that this was the time when workstations were the largest growthsegment of the computer industry-the new wave of the future-and thatcompetition among SUN, Apollo, HP, DEC and IBM was fierce.andP;  ATandamp;T competed inthis arena (they shipped the 3B2), but not at all effectively.andP;  In early1988, when ATandamp;T and SUN Microsystems (the fiercest competitor in a large,growing market) announced a partnership wherein ATandamp;T would buy a portion ofSUN Microsystems and SUN Microsystems would help set the direction of UNIXwith ATandamp;T, cold fear struck at the hearts of the open systems industry.andP;  Herewas the toughest competitor in the industry gaining a large hand incontrolling the direction, the timing and the availability of the &quot;opensystems operating system.&quot; Time-to-market for the other vendors was &quot;down thetubes.&quot; As long as it was just ATandamp;T that controlled UNIX, no one worriedbecause ATandamp;T didn't compete effectively.andP;  But this was different.andM;The stunning result was an unprecedented series of meetings among theadversely affected vendors and fairly rapid convergence on a new idea-themajor vendors would support the formation of an independent, not-for-profitorganization to wrest control of UNIX from a single competitor and level theplaying field by providing open and equal access, in definition and inavailability, to all who wanted to play in the UNIX arena.andP;  Of course, theuse of fair and equal licensing terms was included as one of the major goalsfor this organization.andP;  On May 17, 1988, the Open Software Foundation wasformed to keep control of the direction of open systems  from the grip of onecompetitor.andP;  The aim was to produce a version of UNIX that would beaccessible to all OSF members, who would have access on an equal footing tothe definition of features and their implementation.andM;Following are the guiding principles of the Open SoftwareFoundation-principles which they take very seriously both in spirit and infact:andM;Offerings based on relevant industry standards;andM;Open process to actively solicit inputs and technology;andM;Timely, vendor-neutral decision process;andM;Early and equal access to specifications and software;andM;Hardware independent implementations;andM;Technical innovation through universities and research; andandM;Reasonable, stable terms for licensing.andM;The significant differences between OSF and standards bodies such as POSIXand X/OPEN is that OSF produces reference implementations of technologies andcapabilities (code), as well as specifications and documentation.andP;  This is animportant, valuable contribution to the achievement of timely, universalenvironments.andP;  Since the time of its founding, the OSF has actually exceededexpectations.andP;  It must be noted that they have expanded their originalcharter from producing an open version of UNIX to creating not just anoperating system, but an entire computing environment, all developed usingthe founding principles.andM;These are the achievements of the Open Software Foundation:andM;MOTIF shipped January 1989andM;OSF/I shipped November 1990andM;DCE in development fourth quarter,andM;1991andM;ANDF in selection-due 1992andM;DME in selection-Aue 1992andM;To date, they have produced MOTIF, the now defacto graphical user interfacestandard, and OSF/L, the operating system.andP;  DCE, the distributed computingenvironment targeted for proprietary operating systems as well as UNIX, is inthe works.andP;  DME, the distributed management environment, is now in the RFFphase.andP;  And ANDF, an architecture-neutral distribution format to furtherapplication availability in a vendor-independent way, is also in the RFFprocess.andP;  This is a phenomenal record for an organization just over threeyears old.andM;The significance of the OSF activity lies in the faithfulness to which theyfollow the guiding principles and in the fact that no other mechanism couldhave advanced us so far in so short a time with such acceptance and benefitto the industry.andM;Importance of OSF/1 As aandM;UNIX Operating SystemandM;SF/I is important as an operating system, not just because of the manner inwhich it is developed and licensed.andP;  Although we are making tremendousprogress in the world of standards, the operating system taken as a whole fartranscends what standards define or are likely to cover in the future.andP;  Thecustomers want truly common environments.andP;  The best, indeed the safest, wayto achieve true likeness is with common implementations.andP;  So the majorvendors are committed to shipping OSF/I as their strategic UNIXimplementation.andP;  This will take a few years and various methods of migrationand transition will be offered, but the end result will be a truly commonoperating system environment across vendor platforms, giving the customer thefreedom to choose what he wants and needs.andP;  It will result in applicationsthat run in the same way, in the same overall environment, available frommultiple vendors.andM;Traditionally, UNIX is an operating system well-suited to the one-on-oneworld of the workstation and to the computer literacy of its technical users.andO;Currently, versions of UNIX workstations are sort of like individualautomobiles.andP;  They are dependable, they work well and they let you get aroundusefully.andP;  There is no major crisis if they need repairs or if you crash intosomething; that is, you don't keep a spare car attached to the bumper becauseit is not a total disaster if your car needs to be repaired for a few days.andO;Neither do you have non-stop disaster recovery in UNIX-based workstations.andM;The world of commercial computing needs a different metaphor.andP;  One more likeairplanes perhaps, wherein many seats, very high speeds and dependability area must.andP;  Comfort stations, food and drink--these are all necessary becausethe trips are longer and the audience is captive in the plane.andP;  Of course,crashes are absolutely unacceptable under any conditions! This is probably amore appropriate metaphor for commercial computing.andP;  Business can't stop, itwon't wait.andP;  You will spend the money to have the extra planes standing by incase one has an equipment problem or is held up by weather.andP;  The costjustification is there.andM;Well, UNIX today is still an automobile in some respects; perhaps by now itis closer to a bus or perhaps a train.andP;  Certainly HP and others in theindustry are working on transforming UNIX to suit the needs of the commercialenvironment.andP;  HP-UX already is a version of UNIX that is quite a way down thepath to full commercialization.andP;  It has a full suite of open systemsinterfaces to provide a very high level of open systems benefits in acommercial environment.andP;  Currently, OSF/I is still more of aworkstation-oriented operating system; it has a little further to go toobtain the commercial features that are required in the computer room.andP;  Itwill be a few years before OSF/I will be a full-fledged, high-availability,OLTP-tuned operating system to provide the maximum benefits ofvendor-independent open systems.andP;  And the rough edges of UNIX, with itsarcane commands (like biff and awk), will be smoothed out for you with suchenhancements as HP/VUE and Distributed New Wave computing.andP;  HP will provideeasy-to-use graphical interfaces to hide the complexity of UNIX and willoffer systems as easy to use as an office PC or Macintosh.andM;That's the open systems story for UNIX-based operating systems.andP;  The HP 3000running MPE today meets most of the requirements for open systems.andP;  Itcurrently provides multivendor interoperability and coexistence with IBM andUNIX systems.andP;  If you aren't already actively involved in seeking out opensystems solutions, you haven't missed the boat at all; you still have plentyof time.andP;  I would guess within a few years they are going to becomeincreasingly important to you and, if you have the resources, I urge you toget involved in the open systems process; to lend your voice as new standardsare defined so that the emerging shape of open systems reflects your needs.andO;After all, you are the customer and the customer is what open systems is allabout.andM;Article #1.andP;  See the Reader Feedback Card in this magazine for information onhow to rate this article.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
