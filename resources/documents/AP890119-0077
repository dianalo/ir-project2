In a statement issued by the PLO news agency Wafa in Nicosia,Arafat addressed ``The Unified National Command'' of the uprisingand ``popular committees, students in schools and universities, andresidents of (refugee) camps and towns and villages.''   Israel, Arafat said, has escalated its ``Iron Fist'' policy totry to crush the rebellion, ``forgetting that our people had decidedfrom the beginning to continue the uprising until the end of theoccupation.''   ``So let us have more confrontation against the Zionistoccupation and the Fascist hordes of murderous settlers.   ``In our steadfastness and faith, the enemy faces its inevitabledilemma, from which the way out is the retreat of its forces fromthe occupied lands,'' Arafat said.   During the uprising, or intefadeh in Arabic, which began inDecember 1987, Palestinians have attacked Israeli soldiers andJewish settlers with stones and firebombs and, in rare instances,with guns and knives.   At least 362 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel on Tuesday announcedtougher measures to deal with the uprising, including increasing thenumber of soldiers authorized to shoot at demonstrators and allowingsoldiers to fire plastic or rubber bullets at stone-throwers as theyflee.   Israeli leaders have blamed the increase in violence in theoccupied lands on the U.S. decision last month to talk with the PLO,saying the opening of the dialogue encourages protesters because itmakes them think their actions bring political gains.   The United States decided to open talks with the PalestineLiberation Organization after Arafat publicly renounced terrorismand acknowledged Israel's right to exist.   Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East warand 1.7 million Palestinians uneasily share the territories with70,000 Jewish settlers.</TEXT></DOC>
