Christians and Moslems marched in separate parades in Beirutmarking independence, underscoring fractured Lebanon's partitioninto sectarian mini-states.   As they celebrated, bursts of gunfire and grenade blastsresounded across the capital when the Syrian-backed Shiite militia,Amal, and the rival pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, clashedin gunbattles in south Beirut slums.   The Israeli raid on the biggest refugee camp in Lebanon killedsix Palestinians, including a 4-year-old girl, and wounded nine. Itwas the first air assault since the declaration of an independentstate of Palestine a week ago.   Police said four Israeli fighter-bombers thundered in onPalestine Liberation Organization targets on the outskirts ofLebanon's southern port of Sidon. They staged four rocket runs infive minutes on a PLO checkpoint at Ein El-Hilweh refugee camp,police said. The camp of 60,000 Palestinians is the largest of the11 in Lebanon.   Two helicopter gunships followed 10 minutes later, police said.They hit two jeeps racing to help wounded guerrillas at the burningcheckpoint.   The bodies of three guerrillas from George Habash's MarxistPopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine were retrieved fromone jeep. The other vehicle belonged to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat'smainstream Fatah, police said.   A Fatah gunner was killed when a rocket slammed into a nearbyartillery base, where a woman and her 4-year-old daughter also died.Rescuers were searching rubble for more victims.   Guerrillas unleashed a screen of Sam-7 Strella missiles at thehelicopters, but made no hits, police said.   A Israeli command communique said its warplanes struck targetsserving as guerrilla headquarters and launching points for attacksagainst Israel.   It was Israel's 22nd air raid in Lebanon this year. By policecount, 108 people have been killed and 309 wounded in 21 air strikessince Jan. 3.   Syrian troops in Beirut's Moslem sector sent loudspeaker vansblaring calls for an immediate cease-fire into the embattled slumsof Chiyah and Ghobeiri. There was no quick report of casualties.``We have not been able to take stock of the losses yet,'' said anAmal spokesman.   The fighting erupted a day after four senior leaders of thefundamentalist Hezbollah escaped assassination by aremote-controlled car bomb.   The two factions are vying for dominance of the 1 million Shiiteswho form Lebanon's biggest sect.   In Beirut, Moslem and Christian units of Lebanon's 42,000-memberarmy staged separate parades to mark independence from France in1943.   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni, and the rival head ofthe Christian Cabinet, Gen. Michel Aoun, delivered separate speeches.   The split celebrations reflected the ongoing political crisisthat has left Lebanon without a president for two months,threatening to formalize the de facto partition after 13 years ofcivil war.   ``Lebanon is in the throes of collapse,'' said Syrian-backedHoss. ``We cannot recover our unity through further dismemberment.If reunion is difficult, partition is impossible.''   Aoun lashed out at Syria and Israel as ``occupiers and usurpers.''   An estimated 40,000 Syrian troops are stationed on 70 percent ofLebanon's territory under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end thecivil war. Israel controls a 6-to-10 mile enclave in south Lebanonas a buffer zone against cross-border guerrilla raids.</TEXT></DOC>
