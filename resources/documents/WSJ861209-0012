MitchellStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/09/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> RAYCONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON) </IN><TEXT>   Raymark Industries Inc., a subsidiary of Raytech Corp., said it tentatively agreed to settle between 10,000 and 15,000 of 28,000 asbestos-injury suits pending against the company.    Under terms of the tentative agreement, reached with the South Carolina law firm Blatt andamp; Fales, claimants would be paid an average of $2,821 a case from a $42 million fund to be created by Raymark's insurance carriers.    The average settlement reached under the pact is far below Raymark's previous accords. Raymark, which has said it would file for bankruptcy-law protection if necessary because of insurance problems and the threat of huge asbestos verdicts, has settled 17,000 lawsuits for an average $5,500 each, according to Raymark's general counsel, LeGrande L. Young.    In disclosing the tentative accord, Mr. Young called settlement of such a large number of suits &quot;significant&quot; for the company. &quot;It has taken 10 years to settle 17,000 suits. Here, we could do 15,000 cases in one fell swoop.&quot;    But the size of the average settlement -- and attorneys' fee agreements that could give them as much as one-third of the individual settlements -- brought strong criticism from other asbestos victims' attorneys, who said they hadn't any intention of lining up behind it.    &quot;It's a terrible settlement,&quot; said Fred Baron, a Dallas attorney who says he has settled more than 500 cases against the company for an average $10,000 each. Blatt andamp; Fales &quot;just made a lot of money. They've sold their clients out.&quot;    Mr. Baron also contended that under the accord, which is contingent on 10,000 settlements, claimants with minor injuries would be encouraged to settle, depleting the funds available for those with more serious claims. &quot;All it's doing is depriving legitimate claimants of an opportunity to go after Raymark's insurance,&quot; he said.    Thomas H. Hart III, a Blatt andamp; Fales partner, conceded that on average, the settlement offer doesn't offer claimants &quot;a whole lot,&quot; but said at least they &quot;have the security they'll get something.&quot;    &quot;The insurance money could dry up,&quot; he said, noting that claimants also could expect to receive a settlement much sooner than in any other litigation.    In addition, Mr. Hart contended that pending claims that seek punitive damages, which aren't covered by insurance, could &quot;wipe out&quot; the company.    But Mr. Hart said his firm wouldn't recommend that clients with large claims join the settlement.    Blatt andamp; Fales has contingency-fee agreements that would pay it one-third of any settlement it directly represented, but Mr. Hart said the U.S. District Court in Wichita, Kan., which would supervise the fund, has said it would examine the fees and probably would limit them.    If the agreement is approved by insurance companies and at least 10,000 claimants by Dec. 31, an interest-bearing fund would be set up by Jan.31 and could distribute awards within 12 months, he said. Mr. Hart said that more than 7,000 claimants already have expressed interest in accepting Raymark's terms in a preliminary polling.    Raymark, a Trumbull, Conn., maker of custom-engineered materials and energy absorption and transmission products, has battled at least 45,000 asbestos suits in the past 10 years, according to its counsel, Mr. Young. It is one of a number of companies that have been sued by thousands of people claiming they have been exposed to asbestos, a mineral once widely used in building and piping insulation.    The agreement is unusual because it would settle the suits against Raymark based on the company's ability to pay rather than on historical settlements.    Raymark has said that pending asbestos-related lawsuits could wipe out its insurance coverage and force it into a bankruptcy-law filing.    Mr. Young said asbestos suits still are pouring in at the rate of 1,000 a month and he doesn't expect the filings to cease before 1990.    During October, Raymark shareholders approved a plan to create a new company, Raytech Corp., that wouldn't have any liability for the asbestos suits. </TEXT></DOC>
