As manyas 95 others were feared dead after an avalanche of mud andboulders crashed into a nursing home.   Firemen used surfboards and the navy used amphibious vehicles torescue people stranded by the storm, which began late Friday nightand left about 3,150 homeless.   State Health director Jose Noronha said at least 70 died and 80to 95 more were feared dead. The same number of victims wasreported by Civil Defense spokesman Bruno Avila, who said the deathtoll could be even higher because of mudslides in poor shantytownsthat line mountainsides in this city of 5.6 million.   The four-hour downpour dumped 4.88 inches on Rio and left manystreets under 5 feet of water.   Mayor Roberto Saturnino Braga declared the city a disaster area,called in all off-duty municipal doctors and canceled apost-Carnival Parade of Champions scheduled for Saturday night.   ``There is nothing to celebrate now. There is only sorrow,''said Martinho da Vila, a popular samba composer who performed inthe famous Carnival festivities here a week ago.   The Vila Isabel neighborhood, whose samba school won this year'stop Carnival prize and which celebrated Wednesday with an all-nightvictory party, was one of the most rain-battered zones in the city.   State troopers were sent out to prevent the looting of storesand stop holdups of drivers whose cars had broken down in the highwater.   Avila said most of the 70 deaths occurred in poor slum areas,where housing is precarious and drains and sewers often nonexistent.   James Lewis, a rescue work coordinator in the mayor's office,said: ``We are accustomed to tragedies in our slums, but this wastoo much. Something definitely must be done to protect slum peoplefrom rainstorms.''   A mudslide knocked down one three-story wing of the three-wingSanta Genoveva Hospital, a Social Security nursing home in SantaTeresa, a well-to-do mountainside neighborhood. There was littlehope that the estimated 80 to 95 elderly patients there would getout alive.   ``There is so much wood and concrete there we don't believeanybody could survive,'' Avila said.   At sundown the rescue efforts were called off for the day.   ``It was awful. All my friends were dead in an instant,'' MariaTeixeira, one of 350 patients evacuated from the two other wings ofthe hospital, told a TV interviewer as she lay in a stretcher.   Boulders and mud left by the storm held up rescuers for threehours on their way to the nursing home.   ``Old people were left standing in the rain and chill all thattime. I don't know how they endured it,'' Lewis said.   The storm, accompanied by near nonstop thunder and lightning,knocked out telephones and international communications and stoppedcommuter trains.   Even the fire department and Civil Defense were without phonesfor a while and had to rely on radio to coordinate rescue work.   Earlier this month, rain caused flooding and mudslides thatkilled about 206 people and drove 13,000 from their homes in Rio deJaneiro state. The hardest-hit spot then was Petropolis, a mountainresort 40 miles north of the city of Rio.</TEXT></DOC>
