General Assembly passed aresolution Wednesday calling on Afghanistan's communist governmentand Moslem guerrillas to open negotiations to establish a coalitiongovernment.   The resolution, adopted by consensus, says a government ofnational reconciliation should rule an Afghan nation that isnon-aligned and Islamic.   The General Assembly has never before ordered the combatants inthe 10-year-old civil war to open peace talks, nor has it specifiedthe ideological or religious orientation of the resultinggovernment of national reconciliation.   ``This was very gratifying for us. Efforts have been going onfor some months to arrive at a consensus,'' said PakistaniAmbassador Nasim Ahmed. He praised the Soviet Union, United Statesand the non-aligned movement for working to reach accord on theresolution.   Both the Security Council and General Assembly have previouslyfocused their peacemaking efforts on conflicts between nations,rather than any internal crisis.   The assembly has no power to enforce its resolutions.   Last week, a delegation of Afghan guerrillas led by Farooq Azam,representing the government-in-exile, declared they would nevernegotiate with or form a government with Afghan President Najib orany senior officials of his communist party, called the People'sDemocratic Party of Afghanistan.   Najib has called for a cease-fire and talks with the guerrillasand offered to bring them into his government, conditions they haverejected.   The U.N. resolution also welcomes the Soviet Union's completionof the withdrawal of more than 100,000 troops by Feb. 15, thedeadline for their pullout set by the Geneva Agreements onAfghanistan.   That accord, mediated by Diego Cordovez, then a U.N.undersecretary-general, called for the Soviet withdrawal andobliged Pakistan and Afghanistan not to interfere in each other'saffairs.   The guerrillas control most of the countryside in Afghanistan,but have made little military or diplomatic progress since theSoviet withdrawal.   The United States and Pakistan have not recognized theirgovernment-in-exile, organized earlier in February during aconvening of the Afghan guerrillas and refugees in Rawalpindi,Pakistan.   Only Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Malaysia and Sudan have recognizedthe government of the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.   The United States supplies the guerrillas with weapons,reportedly distributing them through Pakistan's militaryintelligence service. Supplies, weapons and reinforcements are sentfrom guerrillas camps in Pakistan.   The guerrillas besieged the eastern city of Jalalabad after theSoviet withdrawal, but the Afghan army eventually broke the siege.   Conflicts among various guerrillas factions prevented the groupsfrom mounting a coordinated attack, just as it has thwarted theirattempts to adopt any coherent political program beyond oppositionto Najib.   Diplomats said the guerrillas were hoping to take an Afghan cityso they could move their government into Afghan territory,increasing their chances of winning diplomatic recognition.</TEXT></DOC>
