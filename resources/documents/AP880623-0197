However, similar heat waves and droughts can be expected muchmore often as a result of future warming, said James E. Hansen, aclimatologist at the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New YorkCity.   Hansen told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committeethere is only a 1 percent chance that he is wrong in blaming risingtemperatures around the world on the buildup of manmade gases inthe atmosphere.   For unknown reasons, the earth has been getting warmer for morethan a century, though with cooler intervals. The four warmestyears on record have been recorded in the 1980s _ and without whatHansen called an improbable cooling for the rest of the year, 1988will break all records.   Though there has been much speculation by scientists around theworld that the warming resulted from the greenhouse effect,Hansen's statement is the most definite yet.   Syukuro Manabe, soil specialist at the Geophysical FluidDynamics Laboratory of the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, said it was more likely that the current droughtwas the result of natural fluctuations than the greenhouse warming.   ``It is an example of the kind of drought that will occur morefrequently as the global warming become larger,'' he said.   Many studies have said global warming could bring drasticchanges in weather, including more rainfall at low and highlatitudes and more drought in between, with drastic shifts inpossible crop patterns.   A major report from the World Meteorological Oganization and theUnited Nations Environment Program earlier this month concludedthat without a major effort to fight warming, global temperaturescould increase by 0.54 degrees Fahrenheit per decade until themiddle of the next century, and sea levels could rise by a foot.   Tropical temperatures wouldn't change much at all, but in Canadathe change could be two or three times as large as the average.   Extreme temperatures would occur more often. Hansen earliercalculated that instead of the typical one day a year withtemperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in Washington _ itreached 101 on Wednesday _ the year 2030 could see 12 days. Dallaswould see 78 such days instead of 19.   Gases emitted by modern civilization _ notably carbon dioxidefrom the burning of fossil fuels but also methane, nitrous oxideand the chlorofluorcarbon gases that major nations agreed last yearto reduce _ trap heat from the earth's surface that normally wouldbe radiated out to space just as the glass over a greenhouse trapsthe sun's heat inside.   Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are 10 percentabove 1958 levels and 25 percent above concentrations believed toprevail in 1790, when the industrial revolution brought the firstwidespread burning of coal in industry to fire the new steamengines.   ``If we could magically reduce (annual) emissions (of carbon) byabout 3 billion tons, we could stabilize the content of theatmosphere,'' said George M. Woodwell, director of the Woods HoleResearch Center in Massachusetts. ``It is well within reach, noquestion about that.''   ``The problem ... has the potential for turning the world into aform of chaos not greatly different from that produced by globalwar,'' he said.   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., concerned about his state's coalindustry, asked physical chemist William R. Moomaw of the WorldResources Institute, a Washington-based policy researchorganization, if technology could not reduce the harmful emissions.   ``I'm trying to find a way to use a resource we have,'' Fordsaid.   Moomaw replied, ``I would argue the resource we have in mostabundance is the potential for using fossil fuels more efficientlyat much lower cost than building any form of power generation.''</TEXT></DOC>
