Stamford, Conn.-based Neoax, which sweetened its offer earlier this month to $19 a share, or $589 million, said yesterday it was &quot;reviewing possible responses&quot; to the IU plan. Neoax President Louis A. Guzzetti Jr. said he is now &quot;even more firmly convinced&quot; that his company's bid represents the &quot;best source of value&quot; for IU holders.    IU has rejected both Neoax offers as inadequate. The $589 million bid is scheduled to expire Wednesday, unless extended.    IU defended its restructuring plan as a means to provide holders with an immediate cash payment, while allowing them to &quot;participate in future growth.&quot;    Under the proposed restructuring plan, IU holders would receive $14 a share and a newly issued IU common share in exchange for each of IU's 31 million shares outstanding. Financing for the $434 million cash portion of the plan still hasn't been arranged, IU said, but discussions with prospective lenders were under way.    The transportation and environmental services concern also said it may elect to structure its proposed transaction as a tender offer, pending shareholder approval.    The tender offer would be for only about 63% of the stock outstanding at $22 a share, or about $429.6 million, IU said. Members of IU's senior management probably wouldn't tender their shares under that option, the company added.    IU Chairman John G. Christy urged IU holders to accept the new plan, referring to the Neoax bid as a &quot;raid.&quot; He portrayed the management of Neoax, a maker of customized vehicles and industrial and military equipment, as weaker and less competent than IU's. &quot;Much of its recent experience is in bankruptcy,&quot; he said, alluding to Neoax's predecessor, White Motor Corp., which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings in 1983.    The IU plan is subject to a vote at a special holders meeting March 22.    IU, which has already undergone an extensive restructuring in the past two years, would significantly increase its debt under the payout plan. According to some industry analysts, total debt could rise to $400 million from the current estimated level of $120 million. IU has about $150 million in cash and marketable securities.    IU's Mr. Christy acknowledged the plan would add a new financial burden, but he expressed optimism that a planned disposal of certain notes from prior divestments would generate about $120 million of additional capital &quot;within one year.&quot;    Wall Street investors reacted favorably to IU's proposal. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, the stock rose 50 cents to $19.75 a share.    In national over-the-counter trading, Neoax fell 25 cents to $8.    Analysts generally expressed skepticism about IU's ability to operate under the strain of added debt in a weak economy.    W. Talbot Daley, an analyst with Legg Mason Inc., said IU should have sold its notes &quot;a long time ago.&quot; He said he fails to see a &quot;great benefit to shareholders&quot; in the proposal. &quot;This plan is more to save management's rear end,&quot; he said.    Louis A. Marckesano, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, said he thinks IU executives are &quot;no worse off than they would have been if they had liquidated the company. They really have no other choice.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
