Chevrolet is boosting its ad budget and last nightlaunched the first of three new television advertisements totout the Caprice LTZ, a $20,300 limited-production model thatjust began appearing at Chevrolet dealerships within the pastmonth.</LP><TEXT>   The Caprice Classic LTZ is different from most Capricemodels because it's equipped with the taut-handlingsuspension and wide-tread tires normally reserved for Capricepolice cars.   GM expects to sell only about 10,000 Caprice LTZ's thisyear -- less than 10% of total Caprice sales, said J.C.Perkins, Chevrolet's general manager.   Motor Trend's 39-year-old award has long been regarded byauto makers as a highly effective marketing tool. For the newCaprice, the Petersen Publishing Co. magazine's trophy comesat an opportune time. Sales of the car, which got a radical,aerodynamic look last year, rose 10% during the past threemonths.
