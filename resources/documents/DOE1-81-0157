Values of second derivativesregard to voltage V of probe current Ip=G(V) are measured by the methodof a modulating frequency probe and also electron energy distributionscan be calculated with related formulas. On the other hand, the collisionmechanisms can be detected in comparison with the theoretical secondderivatives calculated from the Boltzmann equation. By examining thedifferences of second derivatives between measured and theoretical valueswith the He model, following items could be detected corresponding toeach electronic energy: step excitation collision, step ionizing collisionof semi-stable atoms, collision among semi-stable atoms, direct excitationcollision and direct ionizing collision. At present, the collision mechanismscan not correspond to gases with unknown reaction mechanism. Measurementsby the modulating high frequency method are fairly accurate. The measuredvalues of second derivatives are effectively adaptable for a plasma-modeling,though the verification is some insufficient about a assumption introducingtheoretical formula and collision cross-section.
