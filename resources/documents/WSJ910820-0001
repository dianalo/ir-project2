According to individuals familiar with the investigation,the agency sent out document requests and subpoenas Friday.The move comes in the wake of disclosures by Salomon BrothersInc. that it had repeatedly violated rules at the Treasury'smultibillion-dollar note auctions.</LP><TEXT>   The SEC requested information from most of the 40 primarydealers, the large commercial and investment banks that areauthorized to trade directly with the Federal Reserve andthat are required to participate in Treasury auctions, theseindividuals said. The requests also went out to other firms,believed to be customers of the primary dealers.   It was unclear how many brokerage firms receivedsubpoenas.   The SEC inquiry is believed to be looking into Treasuryauctions that occurred as early as July 1990, well before theincidents involved in the disclosures by Salomon.   Salomon has said it violated government bidding rules inat least four Treasury note auctions in the past eightmonths. The firm admitted it submitted bids in the names ofcustomers who hadn't authorized it to do so and that itrepeatedly violated Treasury rules that bar anyone frombuying more than 35% of a Treasury issue at an auction. Thedisclosures have led to a shake-up at the firm that includedthe naming of Warren Buffett, a major investor, as itsinterim chairman.   The SEC inquiry is apparently focusing on whether otherfirms may have engaged in similar practices, which would havebeen aimed at increasing the firms' profits fromparticipation in the Treasury auctions.</TEXT></DOC>
