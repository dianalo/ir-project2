The Commission had made appropriate findings asrequired by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFRChapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for PriorHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 14, 1988 (53 FR 8291). No request fora hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to theaction and has determined that an environmental impact statement will notbe prepared and that issuance of this amendment will not have a significanteffect on the quality of the human environment.For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment dated January 5, 1988 and supplemental letters dated February12 and March 15, 1988, (2) Amendment No. 58 to License No. NPF-21, (3)the Commission's related Safety Evaluation and (4) the Commission's EnvironmentalAssessment.
