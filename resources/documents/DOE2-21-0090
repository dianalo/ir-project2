(3) In 1988,section 3 will be completed with rooms for manipulator maintenance anda data processing center. By 1990, a partially lead-shielded glove boxsystem will be installed for examination of tritium-bearing specimens.Two of the old lead-shielded cells mentioned above have been dismounted,one lead-shielded cell was newly installed, and a glove box for examinationof tritium-bearing specimens was set to work as a precursor to the facilityto be erected. The concrete cells and some of the lead-shielded cellscan be made inert with nitrogen, if necessary. The double-lid transfertechnique has been greatly improved. The replacement of defective powermanipulators and slave arms of master/slave manipulators as well as thedisposal of waste take place via the double-lid locks using special gastight containers.</TEXT></DOC>
