General support from industry, environmental organizations andlawmakers on all sides of the issue centered on Bush's willingnessto put a strong proposal on the table after eight years of inactionby the Reagan administration.   But when pressed for their detailed views, these organizationsand lawmakers differed over crucial technical points that eventuallywill decide whether a decade-long congressional logjam over cleanair can be broken.   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said in an Ottawastatement that he Bush proposal was the most positive move by theUnited States in a decade of Canadian complaints and requests foraction.   Canada which blames half its acid rain on pullution flowing infrom the United States.   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said at a news conference,``I am advised the controls ... would satisfy Canada's request for a50 percent reduction in acid rain reaching this country.'' He saidCanada still hopes for a treaty to make the new controls harder toweaken.   The most negative comments came from coal interests.   Richard L. Lawson, president of the National Coal Association,accused Bush of trying ``to accomplish too much, too soon,'' calledsome provisions ``unnecessary, unduly harsh and economicallyonerous'' and warned that ``electric rate payers will likely paymore for electricity.''   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., who represents a coal-producingstate, said Bush's plan to cut acid rain unfairly penalizes thehigh-sulfur coal areas, abandons the promise of clean-coaltechnology and endangers the nation's energy future.   ``The proposal, by leading to massive switching from high-sulfurto low-sulfur coal, will serve as a disincentive to the use ofclean-coal technologies,'' Byrd said.   But more typical were comments by an auto industry spokesman, TimMacCarthy, who said Bush ``has really shown leadership,'' and Rep.Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy and Commerceenvironment subcommittee, who applauded ``the president's commitmentto deal effectively with ... urban air pollution, acid rain, and airtoxics.''   ``This is a long journey beginning with a single step,'' saidRep. Edward R. Madigan of Illinois, ranking Republican on Waxman'ssubcommittee. Jerry Jasinowski, executive vice president of theNational Association of Manufacturers, pronounced the organization``pleased that the president recognizes the value of allowingbusinesswide flexibility.''   A crucial message of support came from House Energy and CommerceChairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich., known for his protection of theauto industry's interests on clean air.   ``The broad outlines appear reasonable, effective and consistentwith the need to promote economic growth and job opportunities,'' hesaid.   Demonstrating how the harmony breaks down when specifics arediscussed, Waxman said Bush wasn't tough enough on reduction ofmotor vehicle emissions, adding: ``Without tough new controls oncars, trucks and buses, we simply won't get clean air.''   MacCarthy, director of federal liaison of the Motor VehicleManufacturers Assocation, said ``We don't support tailpipe emissionsstandards.''   However, MacCarthy, in a statement that could increase chances ofeventual approval of clean air legislation, said, ``There are never100 percent victories in this town (Washington).'' He added ``thereis a very good likelihood there will be some tightening of tailpipestandards.''   David Hawkins, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, anenvironmental group, said Bush left unclear whether he would requireuse of the best possible technology to reduce the largelyunregulated release of airborne toxic chemicals.   David Gardiner, of the Sierra Club, called the air toxics part ofthe bill ``the weakest'' portion. He added that the standard thatwould be imposed on industry ``will not make a dent'' in the problem.   But Gardiner, legislative director of the Sierra Club, said thatoverall, Bush ``laid out a set of objectives that are worthy andwill definitely break the logjam. The reason there was no action thelast eight years was the failure of Reagan to put a proposal on thetable.''   He called Bush's acid rain proposal a strong one but said he'sskeptical about a provision to allow large utilities to trade orsell credits for sulfur dioxide reductions if they exceed theminimum reduction requirements.   ``In theory it should work,'' Gardiner said, but added that inpractice, the trades or sales could result in an imbalance, wherethere are major reductions in one region and few in another.   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chief sponsor of clean air legislationin the Senate, said, ``The rhetoric is good, but it's a bit vague inthe urban smog provisions.''   He praised an ``attitude change'' in the White House because Bush``is committed to a bill, which was not the case'' during RonaldReagan's presidency. ``But the actual language is going to tellwhere the president is. All interests are much more inclined tocompromise,'' Baucus said.   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, last year'schief clean air legislative sponsor, called Bush's statement ``asignificant departure from the negative environmental policy of theReagan administration, which opposed every clean-air bill consideredby Congress for the past eight years.''   He said the government ``must be prepared to deal fairly andhumanely'' with the job loss that the proposal is likely to produce.   Mitchell said he is concerned that the president did not say howthe proposed reductions would be made, adding, ``the history of theClean Air Act demonstrates clearly that merely setting forth goalsis not sufficient to achieve them.''</TEXT></DOC>
