The case, which involves four Wall Street professionals and a client of one of them, has drawn much interest because of the defendants' youth. But the size of Mr. David's settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission is dwarfed by the scope of other big insider actions recently, such as the $100 million in returned profits and fines in the unrelated Ivan F. Boesky case.    Mr. David, 28 years old, was a corporate/bankruptcy associate at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison, a prominent New York law firm. Last month Mr. David pleaded guilty to four criminal counts related to the theft from Paul Weiss of inside information pertaining to six takeover-related transactions involving the law firm. He is the only one of the five defendants so far to face SEC charges.    One of the others, Andrew Solomon, a 27-year-old former analyst, earlier was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine as part of his criminal sentence.    Mr. David admitted to the SEC charges and agreed to turn over $50,000 in trading profits and to pay a civil penalty of as much as $100,000. By contrast, most defendants in such actions sign consents in which they neither admit nor deny wrongdoing. Mr. David will pay his penalty over the next 11 years based on how much money he makes during that time, the SEC said.    Mr. David is scheduled to be sentenced on the criminal charges in March. He is cooperating with a continuing government probe arising from the case, his lawyer said. Mr. David, who declined to comment on the case, faces a maximum sentence of 20 years and a $1 million fine.    The SEC settlement, which is subject to federal court approval, involves alleged insider trading in shares of four companies that were takeover targets of Paul Weiss clients. For example, the SEC charged, Mr. David leaked information that GAF Corp. was preparing a bid for Union Carbide Corp. several days before the Dec. 9, 1985, announcement by GAF, a Paul Weiss client. GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based maker of chemicals and building materials, didn't manage to acquire the Danbury, Conn.-based chemicals giant.    Mr. David also was accused of leaking news that Dominion Textile Inc., another Paul Weiss client, was planning an offer for Avondale Mills about a month before it was announced in February 1986, as well as leaking word later that Montreal-based Dominion was sweetening its bid for the Sylacauga, Ala., maker of denim and yarn. That bid was announced March 18. Avondale eventually accepted a higher bid from another suitor.    The four other individuals, all in their 20s, pleaded guilty in June to charges of using the inside information stolen from Paul Weiss. The four include two former analysts, Mr. Solomon at Marcus Schloss andamp; Co. and one at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; a former stockbroker at Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook andamp; Weeden Inc., now Moseley Securities Corp.; and a client of the broker. The former employers of the four Wall Street professionals have asserted that they weren't aware of any wrongdoing.    Besides the monetary penalty, Mr. David was barred permanently from violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Such an injunction allows the government to seek a stiffer penalty than usual if a defendant is accused of breaking the law again. </TEXT></DOC>
