<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-61-0790 </DOCNO><TEXT>A general description is given of the transport process mechanics in thesaltation layer and below, including the effect of the sand on the windin time-averaged terms. Recent analyses of saltation and of intersaltationcollision are reviewed, as is work on surface grain re-sorting. Attentionis drawn to the lack of adequate knowledge of momentum transfer mechanismsin the saltation layer and the resulting instantaneous velocity field.The evolution of sand transport models from that of Bagnold is described,including a requisite model not yet implemented for establishing thestable grain activity level in a given wind. The research needs of thesubject are related to the problems of implementing this model. Soiltransport is discussed as a more complicated extension of sand transport.The research requirements of semi-arid agriculture are outlined and expressedin terms of models of clean air flow over complex terrain and of theresponsive particle-laden boundary layer.</TEXT></DOC>
