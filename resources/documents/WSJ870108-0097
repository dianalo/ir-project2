Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ruled that unpasteurized milk is unsafe and that agency officials were arbitrary and capricious in refusing to ban its sale. The department banned such sales in 1973, but stayed the ruling after raw-milk producers claimed the product is safe if a certification process is used. After years of testing and legal disputes, Margaret Heckler, former secretary of the department, decided that a ban was unnecessary because most raw milk is sold intrastate.    Public Citizen, a consumer group, and the American Public Health Association, a health-care group, filed suit in 1984 seeking both an interstate and intrastate ban on sales of unpasteurized milk. The judge refused to ban sales within a state but said the agency would be allowed to impose such a ban if interstate sales continue.    Sidney Wolfe, head of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, said bacteria-infected raw milk can cause serious illness and death, particularly in infants and the elderly. Dr. Wolfe predicted that the judge's ruling will lead more states to ban raw milk sales. Thirty states already forbid the sale of raw milk.    The ruling will have its greatest effect on Alta-Dena Certified Dairy of City of Industry, Calif., the nation's largest raw-milk producer and an aggressive defender of the product. Though the company's milk has failed state tests for salmonella several times, Alta-Dena denies there are any problems with its products.    A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration, an arm of Health and Human Services, said the agency hasn't decided whether to appeal the judge's order. </TEXT></DOC>
