Southwest Forest, a paper and wood-products manufacturer, declined to specify the nature of the announcement or when it will be made.    In removing the anti-takeover provision, Southwest Forest said it will redeem the shareholder rights associated with its common stock. Southwest Forest said it will pay 25 cents a share to stock of record Feb. 4 to redeem the rights. The payment will be made as soon as possible after Feb. 4, the company said.    The rights were issued in 1984 to defend against &quot;unsolicited takeover attempts,&quot; a Southwest Forest spokeswoman said.    Last year, Southwest Forest was the target of an Oklahoma investor group that threatened to wage a proxy fight. However, the group abandoned its efforts after Southwest Forest agreed to pay half the group's legal and proxy solicitation costs, up to $250,000. </TEXT></DOC>
