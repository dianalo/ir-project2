For decades he's served as a Kremlin mouthpiece in the Western press and has enjoyed trips to the West and a &quot;dacha.&quot; When Mr. Louis developed liver trouble, he turned to one of the most expensive and newer procedures in the repertoire of medical science, a transplant. For this he jumped a queue at Addenbrooke's, a prestigious teaching hospital in Cambridge, where some 5,000 British citizens are on the waiting list for various procedures. Mr. Louis's operation cost him less than #30,000 (about $53,000) or about one-fifth the amount charged in the U.S. for the procedure.    The case of Victor Louis's liver is one symptom of the massive ailment afflicting Britain's National Health Service. Forty years ago this summer, the postwar government established the program of free health care as one of the planks of its new social welfare state. Today the NHS has grown into an overblown ministate so big that it's the largest employer in Europe. Until now a strong belief that the state should provide health care has meant more than 90% of the British still stick to a program that has more than half a million of them on waiting lists for hospital treatment. Even Margaret Thatcher, Britain's long-serving prime minister and the leader who tamed unions and denationalized industries, has raised health spending and hasn't yet proposed fundamental reform of the NHS.    But the fact that foreigners such as Mr. Louis and Britons who have opted for private insurance get immediate treatment is putting pressure on the old system. More of a challenge comes from medical advances -- such as liver transplants -- that show Britons what they are missing.    At a time when some U.S. policy makers are arguing that government must play a bigger role in apportioning a limited &quot;pie&quot; of medical treatment, Britain shows how this philosophy is unworkable. For those who say more government involvement is the answer to America's runaway health costs, the NHS offers a second anti-model: The state system produces inequities and has become so closed that pricing mechanisms no longer reflect health costs.    &quot;The new protest over the National Health Service is in one sense a product of Thatcherism,&quot; says David Willetts of the Centre for Policy Studies, a conservative think tank. &quot;The government has opened so many doors for people that now they want this one opened, too.&quot;    The story of the NHS is the story of what happens when government ordains citizens' medical biographies. Britain first nationalized health care following World War II when, after six years of wartime rationing, the nation was accustomed to direction from above. For decades such deference helped keep spending down to levels much admired by American reformers. Even today Britain spends less than 6% of its gross national product on health, more than four percentage points lower than the U.S. But the cost of this efficiency has been rigid prioritization that has lowered the quality of some lives and shortened others.    Take treatment for kidney problems. Although Britain was the first European country to set up a national kidney-failure program, the nation now gives dialysis to fewer numbers per hundred of its population than any other European country except Finland. The Kidney Patient Association, an independent group, estimates that some 1,500 Britons die every year because of lack of kidney treatment. At Addenbrooke's, the hospital where the paying Soviet journalist got treatment, about two-thirds of cases classified &quot;urgent&quot; have waited more than a month, and some 40% of those hoping for &quot;non-urgent&quot; procedures have been waiting for more than a year. Citizens with private insurance or foreigners who pay like Mr. Louis can jump the line at public hospitals. So can many NHS cases classified &quot;emergency.&quot; But sick Britons who aren't expected to die the next day queue.    Rising expectations among citizens of all ages, though, are the biggest enemy of the NHS. Daily newspaper headlines such as &quot;'Thousands Dying' From Lack of Heart Care&quot; confront British readers. A series called &quot;That's Life&quot; brings frequent reports of cutting-edge medical technology of the sort not unlike the moment-to-moment coverage Americans watched in 1985 during the drama of William Schroeder's artificial heart. One special featured puffyfaced children who'd undergone difficult transplants of livers, hearts and lungs.    The nation's response tells a lot about what happens when the state is in control of such life-giving powers. Price mechanisms that operate in genuine markets are absent here, so that both those within and without the NHS have little idea what those changes could cost. While American health costs are inflated by uneconomical third-party payment systems or malpractice insurance, in Britain they are unrealistically low -- or not set at all. In this the government enjoys the cooperation of much of the British medical establishment, and even those who might see the benefits of competition, such as private insurers and the pharmaceuticals industry. A pamphlet produced by the British Pharmaceutical Industry's association reports of scientific advances in vaguely Luddite tones: &quot;Because medical science is an international activity, the government has no control over the rate of technological progress, only over the extent of its application within the NHS.&quot;    A lesson in the pain of dismantling this &quot;dirigisme&quot; is showing up this month in a national nursing crisis. For years, nurses have been fleeing Britain for better-paying markets and creating an acute nursing shortage. The #13,000 standard salary for nurses is now so low that Britain's nurses, historically a loyal bunch, early this month staged what was believed to be their first strike ever. But only days later this action was followed by a 24-hour nurse walkout in Scotland: The second time, though, the nurses were protesting plans to privatize parts of hospital service.    The medical turmoil has, so far, shown the limits of the Thatcher revolution. This week increased pressure drew promises of radical reform from 10 Downing Street. The opposition Labor Party, albeit inadvertently, is forcing action as well. Although Labor's major efforts have been to spend more on the existing system, the party's complaints are widening citizens' perspective on change. But until now the cabinet has stuck to what could be called the East German approach to state medicine: Advisers speak of better management, not of free enterprise.    Some answers for the NHS problem, though, can be found right here in Britain. The uneconomical pricing system and unreasonable malpractice awards that plague the U.S. are all strangers here, and ought to remain so. A tradition of charity always has strengthened British health care. If the virtue served foreigners such as Mr. Louis under Britain's state system, think what it could do for Britons, after it.    ---   Miss Shlaes is editorial-features editor of The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
