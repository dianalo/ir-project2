The United States is expected to draw down on surplus stocks sothat it can continue its export push and hold onto clients.   Indeed, the drought's major impact on Europe may be tostrengthen the negotiating hand of Europeans who have beenresisting U.S. demands for dramatic changes in agriculturalpolicies that heavily subsidize farmers.   The dry weather has sent world commodity prices soaring.   With higher world prices, the European Economic Community, thetrading bloc that handles much of the agricultural policies for 12European nations, will have to pay out less in subsidies, mostlythose to push foreign sales.   That will ease the money pressure on the community, analystssaid, to scale back its farm aid program as the Reaganadministration would like.   ``It couldn't have come at a worst time ...,'' said a U.S.government source, who demanded anonymity. ``It takes away a lot offinancial pressure because the EEC next year will be swimming inbudget resources.''   ``The only real beneficiary ... will be the (EEC's) farmbudget,'' said Tim O'Dell, international economist at the Londonbrokerage of Phillips andamp; Drew.   ``The amount of subsidies the European Community farm budget hasto pay farmers will have to be reduced,'' he said.   Roger Brinner, chief economist at the consulting firm of DataResources Inc. in Lexington, Mass., agreed: ``Since world priceshave risen to a certain extent, the (European) governments have tomake up less of the shortfall (to farmers).''   The drought could translate into savings of at least $1.5billion to $2 billion in subsidies for grains and oilseeds in theEEC's 1989 farm budget, the U.S. source estimated.   Nico Wegter, a spokesman for the trading bloc, said there was noofficial estimate of the impact of the drought on the farm budget.   Budget ministers of the EEC's member nations recently approved adraft budget that calls for funneling $31.5 billion to farmpayments in 1989. Under the spending outline, those payments woulddrain off 59 percent of the trading bloc's total budget.   The EEC provides hefty subsidies to its 18 million farmersthrough guaranteed prices for many of their crops.   In addition, the community gives exporters help so costlierEuropean agricultural products can compete internationally.   The exporters receive refunds, which amount to the differencebetween the price they must pay to buy the European goods and thelower price they earn for the products on the world market.   The United States complains the export subsidies have helped theEEC to increase its share of world market sales and has respondedwith its own Export Enhancement Program.   The program, designed to stimulate overseas sales, pays surplusfarm commodities held in government bins to exporters. The tradebill, recently passed by Congress, extends the program for twoyears with a $2.5 billion price tag.   Analysts for the U.S. Department of Agriculture have said thatalthough the drought is hurting crop production, it will havelittle effect on exports this year.   Brinner predicted that European farmers would make ``nopermanent inroads'' into the export markets.   In agriculture, he said, ``you don't lose a customer forever.... If you have the goods, they'll buy from you.''   However, if the drought continues next year and stocks are low,the United States could not keep up the same level of exports.   The EEC's extensive farm support system has been a sore pointbetween the trading bloc and the United States, which is pressingthe Europeans to get rid of trade-distorting subsidies by the year2000.   Community officials have rejected the Reagan administrationproposal.   ``It would be absolutely unreasonable to think we could leavethe bulk of the farmers to market conditions,'' Wegter said.   Some European officials argue the drought proves the weakness ofthe U.S. argument. It shows, they say, the weather-dependentagricultural sector must be handled gingerly.   ``You can't just deal with it in the same way as the industrialsector,'' said Wegter. ``It needs to be treated in a specific way.''   In February, European leaders began the politically sensitivetask of curbing payments to farmers. They agreed to limit themaximum annual amount of expenditure on price guarantees over thenext five years.   U.S. officials maintain the measures were not extensive enoughto alter a fundamentally flawed policy.   The thorny issue will receive fresh attention in December inMontreal at a review of the Uruguay Round of international tradenegotiations. The talks are held under the auspices of the96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which seeks toliberalize trade among countries.   The EEC is made up of Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France,Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,Portugal and Spain.</TEXT></DOC>
