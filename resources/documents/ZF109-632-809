 But when Most Valuable Product Awards time rolls around atPC/Computing, we're more interested in pushing the envelope.andM;We honor MVPs because great products are the engine that powers the unendingexpansion of PCs in our businesses and lives.andP;  Innovative and powerful newproducts push the envelope of what microcomputers--and those who masterthem--can achieve.andM;That's why, each year, PC/Computing's editors convene to study, nominate,test, discuss, occasionally argue over and finally elect those products wethink represent the best that microcomputing had to offer over the past 12months.andM;How did we determine that the 19 MVPs profiled on the following pages werethe best of 1990?andP;  Eight principles guided our deliberations:andM;The MVP product solves problems that PCs haven't solved before, or solves oldproblems in fresh, insightful ways.andM;It extends a recognized PC solution to new audiences through lower price,greater convenience or smaller size.andM;It breaks a technical threshold.andM;It adds substance to a vital idea, allowing us to see for the first time theform that new concepts will take in our PC lives.andM;It combines technologies in surprising, delightful ways.andM;It offers a glimmer of the future.andM;It blends power, function and style.andM;It rewards the user by saving time, easing effort, creating wealth, enhancingskills or providing a memorable human experience.andM;Here are the products that we think best exemplify those ideals.andM;We proudly present PC/Computing's Most Valuable Products of 1990.andM;TRAVELMATE 3000andM;SMaller, faster, lighter--you can be sure these three words will describeother notebook PCs to come.andP;  But no notebook upped the ante this year assignificantly as Texas Instruments' TravelMate 3000.andM;First TI and Sharp made compact, lightweight notebook computing a realitywith the essentially similar, 80C286-based TI TravelMate 2000 and SharpPC-6220, which weigh a feathery 4.4 pounds.andP;  Then TI created the TravelMate3000 with a 20MHz 80386SX processor, 2MB of RAM and a 3-1/2-inch, 1.44MBfloppy drive, making it powerful enough to run Windows comfortably.andM;Not until you hold this computer in your hands do you begin to understandwhat sets it apart from the pack.andP;  Fully loaded with a 20MB hard disk (a 40MBdrive is optional) and a NiCad battery, it weighs 5.7 pounds.andP;  Then considerthe dimensions: The TI's basic footprint is 8-1/2 by 11 inches, and it's lessthan 2 inches thick.andP;  The term &quot;notebook&quot; was coined for heft and dimensionslike these.andM;Other features are intriguing, too.andP;  The TravelMate offers an impressivesidelit triple-supertwist LCD VGA display with 32 gray scales.andP;  At 8 by 6inches, the screen is among the largest of any notebook on the market.andO;Instead of the various shades of blue found on other notebooks, there's aneye-saving black-on-white display.andM;About the only drawback to the TravelMate 3000 is its $5,500 price tag.andP;  Evenso, the 3000 is the definition of the shape and size of notebook computing.andO;In those circles, it's a tough act to follow.andM;THE TYPISTandM;For a long time, optical character recognition--teaching a computer toread--was comparable to teaching a pig to sing: It required a great deal ofeffort, it often failed to produce satisfactory results, and it annoyed thepig.andP;  While OCR has improved of late, thanks to the skill of software writersand the increased computing power of PCs, it hasn't been easy until TheTypist from the Caere Corporation.andM;The $595 Typist is a combination of three ingredients.andP;  The racy-lookingblack hand scanner is well designed and more stable than similar devices.andO;Second, the OCR software derives from Caere's OmniPage products, which areamong the best OCR programs for the PC and the Mac.andP;  (The software is&quot;omnifont,&quot; which means it can recognize text in a variety of type styles andsizes.)andP;  The third--and most important--ingredient is good old-fashionedingenuity: Because hand scanners capture an image from only part of astandard 8-1/2-by-11-inch page, The Typist's software automatically stitchestogether multiple partial images to make a whole.andM;Caere has also added value by integrating OCR into other applications: Whenyou come to the place in a word-processing document or a spreadsheet whereyou want to insert text from a printed document, you pop up The Typist's TSRsoftware and scan the document.andP;  The Typist feeds the recognized text intothe underlying application through the keyboard buffer.andP;  The software alsocaptures graphics.andM;Thanks to The Typist, we can use OCR the way it should be used--as a handytool for feeding text directly into applications.andM;WINDOWS 3.0andM;When the annals of the PC age are written, May 22, 1990, will mark the firstday of the second era of IBM-compatible PCs.andP;  On that day, Microsoft releasedWindows 3.0.andP;  And on that day, the IBM-compatible PC, a machine hobbled by anoutmoded, character-based operating system and seventies-style programs, wastransformed into a computer that could soar in a decade of multitaskinggraphical operating environments and powerful new applications.andM;Windows 3.0 gets right what its predecessors--VisiOn, GEM, earlier versionsof Windows and OS/2 Presentation Manager--got wrong.andP;  It delivers adequateperformance, it accommodates existing DOS applications, and it makes youbelieve that it belongs on a PC.andM;Clearly, Windows 3.0 isn't perfect.andP;  It can be criticized for its dependenceon DOS, its not-inconsiderable hardware requirements and the inconsistency ofits interface.andP;  Nevertheless, this $149 program is the most successfulattempt yet to provide a multitasking, graphical environment for the PC.andM;Realistically, it's good enough to work with today, while convincing us thatit will only get better.andP;  And it's good enough to let application developersstrut their stuff in such programs as Word for Windows, Ami Professional,Excel, SuperBase, ToolBook, Designer, Corel Draw, PowerPoint andCharisma--programs so powerful, so easy to use and so compatible that, incomparison, their character-based competitors look like last year's joke.andM;With Windows 3.0, the PC has taken its first sure steps toward the future.andO;Now there can be no turning back.andP;  In the long run, the future may belong toPresentation Manager or Motif or NextStep, or to some environment that wehaven't even heard of yet.andP;  But the success of Windows 3.0 has ensured that,whichever environment ultimately prevails, it will be multitasking andgraphical.andM;TARGA PLUSandM;Truevision defined the high end of PC video five years ago with the releaseof Targa, a $4,995 proprietary video card that put enough color, depth andprecision into a PC graphic for it to merit the label &quot;art.&quot;andP;  This year,Truevision redefined that realm with the new Targa Plus, a much enhanced,much less expensive board (prices start at $1,795) that puts the ability toproduce studio-quality video presentations right at your fingertips.andM;Where Targa's strength was its ability to produce colorful photo-realisticstill images and color separations for desktop publishers, Targa Plus allowsyou to create studio-quality video productions that incorporate images andanimations created with standard VGA graphics software.andM;No longer is Targa a design-shop-only solution--the card is available to allPC users.andP;  Its VAGA pass-through feature lets you run your VGA applicationsfrom the same video system you use to enhance those four-color illustrationsin the company's annual report.andM;With the Targa Plus chroma-keyer, you can bring in a live video feed anddisplay it on a PC monitor with special-effects graphics you've created andstored on your PC.andP;  You can also capture the video frame by frame, enhanceand manipulate the frames using your Targa applications and blend the resultswith a graphic created in Freelance Plus or an animation you produced inAutoDesk Animator.andM;With its new features and new price, Targa moves into the mainstream of PCvideo and redefines our expectations of PC graphics.andM;LASERJET IIIandM;Can it be that other laser printers even existed before the Hewlett-PackardLaserJet III?andP;  Not even a year old, this $2,395 printer has already becomethe yardstick against which every non-PostScript laser printer is measured.andO;And though the price-cutting and feature enhancements it has spurred amongthe competition are a consumer's dream, you just can't go wrong by followingthis leader.andM;Quite simply, this is a terrific package for a terrific price.andP;  With HP'slatest printer language, PCL 5, the LaserJet III breaks new ground innon-PostScript output.andP;  You can scale the eight resident typeface outlines onthe fly to any size you like.andP;  You can place text and graphics on the pagewith impunity.andP;  Making it all razor-sharp is the LAserJet III's chip-levelResolution Enhancement technology.andM;Along with impressive desktop publishing capabilities, the LaserJet III isevery bit the office workhorse its LaserJet predecessors were.andP;  With aprinting speed of 8 pages per minute, a 250-sheet paper tray and 1MB ofstandard RAM, the LaserJet III can serve as a feature-rich network printer.andM;Although the LaserJet III lacks PostScript, it's only a cartridge (and arecommended memory upgrade) away.andP;  And because HP has continued to usecartridge slots, rather than the proprietary card slots that most laserprinter vendors have adopted, you have a choice of less-expensive third-partyPostScript.andM;Here the MVP emphasis is clearly on &quot;V,&quot; for value.andM;WINGZ FOR WINDOWSandM;Lotus 1-2-3 running on an AT gave the world a universal language forinformation--a language of rows and columns, sums and divisions.andP;  Butstandalone worksheets on standalone PCs are yesterday's news.andP;  As our reachfor information becomes more ambitious (across networks to corporatedatabases), along comes Informix's Wingz for Windows just in time to help.andM;Wingz speaks the familiar language of spreadsheets.andP;  But it also speaks thenewer languages of networks and databases, graphical interfaces andpresentation graphics.andM;Wing's spreadsheet functions are larger than life (32,768 rows by 32,768columns yield a worksheet with more than 1 billion usable cells).andP;  Its 3-Dcharting, text and drawing functions put most presentation-graphics packagesto shame.andP;  Written in HyperScript, Wingz is programmable in ways that givenew meaning to the word.andM;Wingz also includes DataLink, a point-and-click query builder that generatesSQL code to query Informix databases.andP;  This database link moves spreadsheetsinto the world of client-server applications, and not by accident.andO;Informix's strategy is to make Wingz available as a common user interfaceacross several computing platforms.andM;You don't need SQL databases to benefit from Wingz's ease of learning anduse.andP;  At $499, it's a great standalone spreadsheet that makes good use of theWindows 3.0 interface.andP;  But with the customizing features provided byHyperScript and the connectivity of DataLink, Wingz is ready for wherever thefuture takes you.andM;HAYES ULTRA 96andM;With the Hayes Ultra 96, high-speed intelligent modems have dropped to aprice that ordinary users can afford--and in a form they'll want to use.andM;The $1,199 Ultra 96 is a model of the modem's future.andP;  It embodies all thefeatures that will be required for high-speed modem communications in thenineties: support for current international file-transfer and modulationprotocols and sturdy construction, all backed by a reliable company with along, reputable record in communications.andM;The Ultra 96 is also a performance maniac.andP;  Although it is rated at 9,600bps, the Ultra 96 can use newly adopted communications standards to reach38,400 bps under certain conditions.andP;  And because the Ultra 96 supports awide variety of protocols, it allows reliable access to almost any BBS orpublic data service.andP;  If you dial a modem that doesn't use standardprotocols, the Ultra 96 steps down and speaks to the other modem in whatevercommunications format both understand.andP;  This ability to work at the highestcommon communications denominator means that the Ultra 96 will get themessage through or the file downloaded with unheard-of consistency.andM;Many similar products are sure to follow the Ultra 96.andP;  But Hayes hasestablished a high bar for competitors.andP;  Once again, it has set a modemstandard.andM;CANON BJ-10EandM;The Canon BJ-10e Bubble Jet is the ideal printer to have if you have to takeit with you ...andP;  or even if you don't.andM;Weighing only 41/2 pounds, including an optional battery pack, this $499portable ink jet printer is well-suited for travelers, but you may be temptedto use it on your desktop as well.andP;  That's because it produces surprisinglycrisp output that actually looks better than that provided byHewlett-Packard's DeskJet Plus.andM;The BJ-10e produces Courier and Prestige Elite fonts at four pitches andoffers 11 variations of character height and width.andP;  This is serviceable foranyone who needs to print while on the road, although the BJ-10e can befurther enhanced by downloaded bit-mapped fonts.andP;  IBM Proprinter X24Eemulation provides compatibility with a number of applications.andO;Unfortunately, the page-and-a-half-per-minute BJ-10e doesn't emulate the HPLaserJet, which limits its usefulness on the desktop.andM;But if you're on the move, you'll be too happy to care.andP;  The Canon Bubble jetis cleverly designed to conserve space when printing multiple sheets,standing on end and using its cover as an output tray.andP;  Such details make theBJ-10e a pleasure to take on the road or to shuttle between home and theoffice--all at a price lower than that of any comparable portable.andM;SCANMAN 256andM;Today it's desktop publishing.andP;  Tomorrow it will be multimedia.andP;  There's apent-up demand to use the PC for graphics, but it awaits the delivery ofbetter image-manipulation tools.andP;  Logitech's ScanMan 256 is one of thosetools.andM;A major improvement in Logitech's hand-scanner technology, the ScanMan 256produces scanned images of photographic quality that display 256 levels ofgray.andP;  These are true gray-scale files that can be made into true halftonesfor publication, not bit-mapped images that use dithering dot patterns tosimulate grays and halftones.andP;  Images can be scaled without losing tonalfidelity.andP;  And they can be edited with Ansel, the ScanMan 256's operating andimage-editing software package.andM;Ansel special attention.andP;  It doesn't provide the widest range of editingtools, but it does provide the most widely useful ones.andM;This software offering boasts two features that are absolutely necesary to ahand scanner: It can stitch together multiple scans to capture images largerthan the $499 ScanMan 256's scanning head, and it can aligh images that havebeen scanned slightly out of horizontal or vertical alignment.andM;Ansel is a strong Windows 3.0 implementation.andP;  It supports the contentionthat graphical interfaces will make applications easier to learn and use(which can't be said for many first-generation Windows 3.0 applications).andM;Desktop publishers will love Ansel and the ScanMan 256 for improving thequality of gray-scale images captured for printing.andP;  (See page 46 for a fullreview.)andM;ATM FOR WINDOWSandM;It's ironic that it takes a $99 utility program to turn your expensiveWindows-equipped computer into a true Wysiwyg graphical environment.andP;  Windowsitself doesn't do it and neither do most Windows applications.andP;  Adobe TypeManager for Windows does it.andM;Under Windows' font-management system, you're stuck with a meager selectionof typefaces and sizes.andP;  ATM offers a cornucopia of type that appearsonscreen precisely as it will appear on your output device.andP;  Margins willmatch, bold will be bold, jagged edges will disappear.andP;  At last, you'll seehow your screen fonts look in a document without wasting a ton of treesprinting draft copies.andM;Installing and using ATM couldn't be easier.andP;  After a five-minuteinstallation routine, you'll have 13 scalable typefaces in Times Roman,Helvetica, Courier and Symbol.andP;  If you'd like more, Adobe sells a hugeselection of typefaces that you can install in ATM.andM;The effect is marvelous.andP;  Install ATM and each of your Windows applicationsinstantly sports 13 new typefaces that can be scaled and output to all of thedevices that Windows supports.andM;ATM also offers a new lease on life to aging dot matrix and laser printersthat are shipped with only a few internal fonts.andP;  ATM generatesPostScript-quality output on a slew of non-PostScript devices.andM;Although some may view ATM as a stopgap measure until Microsoft deliversoperating systems that contain TrueType, Microsoft's scalable font solution,ATM is a real product that solves a real problem elegantly and effectively.andO;Our eyes are grateful.andM;ALR BUSINESS VEISAandM;ALR's Business VEISA is a little machine that grows with you.andP;  With its CPUon a board, it takes only five minutes to transform the VEISA from arespectable 20MHz 386SX PC to a blazing 33MHz 486 (or toan intermediate 33MHz386 or 25MHz 486).andP;  The swappable CPUs make upgrading less expensive and lessbothersome because the only thing you change are the boards--there's no driveto back up and restore, no system setup to reconfigure.andP;  And you sacrificenothing for such versatility.andP;  The VEISA in any of its incarnations runs asfast as any comparably powered PC.andM;This small-footprint desktop PC has room to grow inside, too, with most ofits slots and one drive bay open.andP;  The machine's EISA bus means you can useAT-class expansion boards now and 32-bit boards in the future without losingyour investment.andM;And for a machine with so much potential, that investment is relativelymodest: $4,299 for the starter 386SX with a 110MB drive, 2MB of RAM and a32MB RAM cache.andP;  Upgrades range from $999 to $3,195, depending on how big ajump you take.andM;INTEL SATISFAXTIONandM;Intel perfected PC-based faxing this year by transforming its ConnectionCoProcessor into the state-of-the-art SatisFaxtion board.andP;  The company hasslashed hundreds of dollars from the CoProcessor's price and added a slew ofnew hardware and software features.andM;With an on-board 16MHz 80186 chip to handle fax processing, SatisFaxtiontruly faxes in the background, unlike boards that take control of your PCwhen sending or receiving faxes.andP;  (See page 272 for comparisons.)andP;  Innovativesoftware lets you run SatisFaxtion under DOS or Windows.andP;  Installation, sooften a problem with tax boards, couldn't be easier--there are no switches orjumpers to set.andM;The $499 SatisFaxtion board includes a 2,400-bps modem that is compatiblewith MNP level 5 error-correction protocols; when you communicate with otherMNP 5 online services or modems, your effective throughput reaches 4,800 bps.andO;A scanner port is included as well, and Intel offers an optional $399handheld scanner.andM;The board is so well designed that it may compel other board makers to adoptthe DCA/Intel Communicating Applications Standard, eventually leading tolower prices and a greater variety of third-party fax software.andM;But there's really no need to wait for prices to fall and more software tobecome available.andP;  SatisFaxion is the board that finally makes PC faxing aseasy and inexpensive as using a standalone fax machine.andM;LUTOS NOTESandM;For years, &quot;groupware&quot; has been more myth than reality.andP;  The advent of Notesmade 1990 the year groupware got real.andP;  Notes helps each member of a groupknow what other members know.andP;  Simple as that sounds, it represents amouth-watering and elusive business benefit that requires a rich, complexproduct to deliver.andM;Essentially, Notes is group communications software that helps people usingPCs create and access shared information.andP;  It encompasses three majorfunctions: text editing, document management and wide-area area electroniccommunications.andP;  Notes delivers these capabilities to all members of a groupin a high-security environment across a standard PC local area network.andM;Notes is true client-server software--perhaps the first useful member of thattribe.andP;  The server program runs under OS/2 on a networked PC that's dedicatedto managing a group's documents and communications.andP;  The client software,which runs on all Notes users' PCs under DOS and Microsoft Windows or OS/2Presentation Manager, manages the program's graphical menu-based interface,gives users tools for such tasks as creating documents or editing text andprovides access to databases on the server.andM;Notes' capabilities are completely customizable, allowing you to designdatabases that reflect specific projects or purposes.andP;  This programmabilitymeans that database applications can be adapted to meet the information needsand working patterns of Notes users, rather than forcing them to change theway they work as a group to use Notes.andM;Of course, Notes isn't for every group.andP;  With an entry price of $62,500 for200 users, how could it be?andP;  But it is a ground-breaking collection ofconcepts that will change the course of application software for networks,from its &quot;dsktop&quot; interface to the way it keeps multiple copies of databasesupdated and in sync across inexpensive dial-up lines.andM;With Notes, groupware has at last come into its own.andM;GEOWORKS' ENSEMBLEandM;With Ensembel, tiny GeoWorks did what Microsoft and IBM deemed impossible: Itbuilt an easy-to-use multitasking graphical operating environment that runssmoothly on XT-class PCs.andP;  While Windows and OS/2 begin to stall on PCs thathave less than a 386SX microprocessor, 2MB of RA, and a 40MB hard disk,Ensemble provides snappy performance on any hard-disk-equipped PC, even an8088.andM;Impressive as that may be, it's just the beginning of Ensemble's versatility.andO;Although its ability to run on low-end machines would suggest countlesscompromises in performance and capability, the $195 Ensemble is neither a toynor a smoke-and-mirrors imitation of a graphical environment as Tandy'sDeskMate is.andP;  Instead, it is a technically impressive product regardless ofhardware platform.andP;  (See page 45 for a more in-depth review.)andP;  Ensemble evenoutduels Windows in some areas: It offers a true, multithreaded, pre-emptivemultitasking environment that Windows can't match, scalable outline fontsthat Windows lacks and, when running on the same level of hardware,significantly faster performance than Windows.andM;True, Ensemble won't be a power on high-end PCs until more developers line upbehind it.andP;  But the suite of applications that Ensemble includes--wordprocessor, drawing program, calendar and Rolodex--is remarkably capable.andP;  Welook forward to seeing Ensemble proliferate on laptops, on PCs for home andsmall-office use and on the millions of PCs that lack the power to runWindows or OS/2.andM;GRIDPADandM;A ground-breaking product deserves recognition, even if all the individualtechnologies that have gone into making it aren't absolutely spectacular.andM;GRiD Systems' GRidPad computer shows that handheld pen-to-screen input canwork effectively on a DOS-based computer.andP;  Essentially a black rimsurrounding a 10-inch, 640-by-400-pixel screen with an attached stylus, theGRiDPad is a 10MHz 80C86-based computer with handwriting recognition burnedinto ROM.andP;  Users write instructions to the computer directly on the screenwith the stylus.andP;  Because it weighs only 4 1/2 pounds, you can cradle theGRiDPad in one hand like a clipboard and write on the screen with the other.andO;Tap twice with the stylus on the display, and the GRiDPad shows you a screenrendering of a keyboard on which you can hunt and peck with the stylus to runDOS applications.andM;Although the GRiDPad was designed primarily for use with electronic forms insuch vertical-market applications as route sales, insurance claims adjustingand exit polling, the company expects it to evolve into the mainstream.andP;  Witha short learning curve and a battery that lasts up to eight hours, that's notan improbable scenario.andM;Waiting in the wings, of course, are several pen-based hardware, software andoperating system products that hold the promise of improved features andutility.andP;  but the GRiDPad has sparked the field of inquiry.andP;  this $2,370machine is the only DOS pen-based notebook computer available.andP;  Expect to seefuture GRiDPad iterations still blazing trails.andM;QMPS-PS 410andM;The era of the personal PostScript printer has arrived, ushered in by thesleek QMS-PS 410.andP;  It could be the premier PostScript printing value simplyby virtue of its almost-too-good-to-be-true $2,795 price.andM;But it's the extras the PS 410 brings to the PostScript party that reallymake it shine.andP;  Most PC PostScript printers have 35 scalable typefaces; thePS 410 has 45.andP;  There's a healthy 2MB of RAM, plus an Apple Talk interfacethat comes standard with serial and parallel ports.andM;Such features, not to mention the space-saving size and the crisp-lookingoutput, obviously make the PS 410 a wonderful desktop printer.andP;  But you'llgain additional productivity if you share it with a few colleagues.andP;  Allthree of the PS 410's port connections can be used at once, with the printerdeftly handling traffic on a first-come, first-served basis.andP;  And if someonein the group sends output that requires HP LaserJet II emulation rather thanPostScript, the PS 410's software automatically directs the switch.andM;The PS 410 does have its limitations, such as a poky 4-page-per-minute printspeed.andP;  And with a meager 50-sheet paper tray, this printer will never servemore than a small group, although capacity can be boosted with a 250-sheetfeeder tray for $195.andP;  The two card slots are proprietary, and offerings arecurrently limited.andM;But any limitations of the PS 410 are easily offset by its fabulous featuresand price.andP;  The bottom line is that the QMS-PS 410 is the best PostScriptprinter value available today, and it sets the pace for the PostScriptprinter of tomorrow.andM;QEMM 5.1 andamp; DESQVIEW 2.3andM;Still the best way to multitask DOS applications, Desqview received anaward-winning boost this year, thanks to an upgrade to QEMM, Quarterdeck'smemory management program.andM;By itself, QEMM provides a way to load those RAM-hungry memory-residentutilities, network drivers and peripheral drivers into the limbo region ofmemory called high DOS, freeing room below 640K for applications.andP;  By itself,Desqview is a stable and time-tested method of multitasking standalone DOSapplications, even such notably ill-behaved programs as Lotus 1-2-3.andM;Now, by combining Desqview and QEMM 5.1 ($219.95 for the two) with Windows3.0, you can create a nearly unbeatable platform for running DOS or Windowsapplications.andP;  Previously, QEMM wouldn't run in Windows' 386 Enhanced mode,its most powerful configuration.andP;  This meant that 386 PC users faced adevil's dilemma: QEMM's memory efficiency or optimum Windows performance.andO;But with QEMM 5.1, it's possible to load all those bulky TSRs and networkdrivers into high memory and still take advantage of Windows 3.0 in the 386Enhanced mode.andM;In addition, Desqview 2.3 adds value to Windows by letting you run windows ineither Real or Standard mode in a Desqview window.andP;  The benefit is thatDesqview can multitask DOS applications (which it does very well) while stillproviding Windows services and applications.andP;  If you have enough memory topull this off (generally 2MB or more), you can have the best of both worlds.andO;(See page 64 for a complete review).andM;NORTHGATE OMNIKEY/ULTRAandM;Northgate Computer's OmniKey/Ultra is the keyboard for all those who argueabout whether function keys belong on the side or the top and about where theCtrl and Alt keys should be.andM;Northgate lets you have it your way (mo matter what your way is) with 12function keys down the side and another 12 across the top.andP;  Top keys can beconfigured as unshifted, shifted, Alt-shifted or Ctrl-shifted keys.andP;  A flickof a dip switch swaps the locations of the Alt, Ctrl and Caps Lock keys, andyou have new keycaps to match your changes.andM;The $146 Omnikey/Ultra contains other tricks, too.andP;  In addition to thenumeric keypad, there's a full set of cursor control keys in the sameconfiguration we're accustomed to from XT days.andP;  You can also change the rateat which keys repeat themselves.andP;  A second Shift Lock key prevents the commaand period keys from typing &quot;andless;&quot; or &quot;andgt;&quot;.andP;  And for our fumbling fingers, thePrint Screen key doesn't work unless you hit it twice.andP;  The Keyboard itselfhas a crisp feel.andM;Now Pc users will have to find something else to quarrel about.andM;...  AND SOME JUST MISSED THE SPOTLIGHTandM;Each year, inevitably, some worthy products barely miss the final cut for ourMVP awards.andP;  This year, in particular, strong feelings were expressed infavor of some runners-up.andP;  Here's a rundown on the products it was hard toleave behind:andM;IBM's PS/1.andP;  Some editors love it (particularly those from our Prime Timesection, which deals with non-traditional offices--the prime location forPS/1s).andP;  Others hate it.andP;  Nobody's a middle-of-the-roader on this one.andP;  Oneview:  The PS/1 redefines and reinvigorates the home market.andP;  The opposition:It's an ugly piece of tin that pales in value when compared with many othermanufacturers' low-priced 386SX machines.andP;  The controversy kept the PS/1 offour final MVP list, but any product that generates this much passion clearlybears watching.andM;SuperPrint 1.1  This major upgrade of a well-known product (reviewed on page48) does most of what Adobe Type Manager does.andP;  Adobe is a bit fasteronscreen; SuperPrint is quicker at the printer.andP;  It took a photo finish todetermine the winner in this category.andP;  In the end, we gave the nod to ATMbecause of its unique cross-platform compatibility--the Macintosh's presencein desktop publishing represents a unique advantage for ATM.andP;  But SuperPrintis impressive, especially for those have already invested in existing PCfonts.andP;  If Mac-PC integration doesn't loom large on your agenda, but widefont support does, make sure you check out SuperPrint 1.1.andM;The Brick.andP;  Another object of heated debate.andP;  This CPU-on-the-move (you hookit to monitors and keyboards at various work locations) was originally cutfrom the MVP rolls late in the nominating rounds but generated anunprecedented write-in response during MVP balloting.andP;  It didn't garnerenough votes to make the final list, but Brick adherents fought to the bitterend.andP;  Their position: This product, though saddled with an unfortunate name,was engineered with the way people actually work in mind.andP;  It answers thequestion of how to transport an entire environment to and from several worksites, something no other product handles elegantly.andP;  The opposition: Noproduct that requires lots of plugging and unplugging -- not to mentionredundant, expensive support systems--counts as elegant.andP;  If the vote hadbeen taken a week later...andM;Current.andP;  IBM's personal information manager was unanimously acknowledged asthe best PIM yet.andP;  It failed to make the finals because many editors feltthat where PIMs are concerned, the best still isn't good enough.andP;  Thiscategory cries out for that magical moment when it becomes clear exactly whatthese products can do to help millions of users.andP;  The root of the debate:Those among us who use Current love it; those who don't feel no compulsion tostart.andP;  Something's still missing from PIMs.andM;Aldus Persuasion 2.04 for Windows, Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows,Micrografix Charisma, Cricket Presents Windows 1.2.andP;  This category had thesame problem that many Democratic primaries have--a lot of candidates, allwholesome and worthwhile, but none so distinctive as to become undeniable.andO;All these new-generation presentation graphics packages make great stridesover their predecessors.andP;  They share many core concepts, but each sportsunique features.andP;  Unable to choose one from the crowd, we've decided to waitand see how customers vote.andP;  If we gave an award in the Most Improvedcategory, however, presentation graphics would have been a shoo-in.andM;Thinx.andP;  This Bell Atlantic decision support software drew high praise fromsome and pleas for enlightenment from others.andP;  The consensus seems to be thatthis product could be great if enough users are willing to draw their PCsthis intimately into complex decision-making processes.andP;  Not enough of uswere sure this group exists to award an MVP to what is unquestionably aunique and trend-setting program.andP;  Sometimes cliches are true:  Thinx may beahead of its time.andM;We were also impressed during 1990 by UltraScript, LANtastic, 386Max, Quicken4.0 and Managing Your Money 7.0, but these products, while finding widecommercial acceptance this year, actually were shipped earlier.andP;  Most of themhad new versions during 1990, but we didn't think those incrementalimprovements merited MVP status.andM;During 1990 we sensed a coming explosion in high-end graphics.andP;  In fact, wewere besieged by snazzy display wares.andP;  A couple of these products made thisyear's MVP ranks.andP;  Others missed the list only because we think the impact oftheir technical wizardry lies farther down the road.andP;  The DVA-4000 videocapture and display board is an example; when multimedia PCsarrive, thisboard will be a monster, but not until then.andP;  Likewise the amazing Renderman3-D graphics specification, which has produced award-winning videos.andP;  Wedon't think mainstream PC users are ready to become video producers quiteyet.andM;Another product that amazed us buthasn't yet had a big enough impact on usersto make the final MVP cut was the Edsun Labs Continuous Edge Graphics (CEG)chip set.andP;  Edsun's low-cost display technology could completely redefine theway we look at computers.andP;  The three chips make it possible for monitors withVGA and higher resolution to display images that appear to have extremelyhigh resolution and broad color capabilities.andP;  While the resolution boost isan effective, rather than a true, increase, the resulting screens lookcomparable to those displayed by monitors with resolutions as high as 2,048by 2,048 pixels.andP;  Seeing is believing, but not enough people have seen theEdsun chips in action yet.andP;  We expect big things from this product in PCsreleased during 1991.andM;Finally, a special citation for SimCity.andP;  In a games world dominated bymindless, shoot-'em-up airplane fights and Conan the Barbarian ripoffs,SimCity stands out for its innovation, intelligence, elegance and wit.andP;  Asimulation in which you build a city step by step (and suffer the wrath ofthe resident Sims when you misplan, as you inevitably do), this is the firstgame to take its fun seriously.andP;  It's not that SimCity isn't entertaining--itmay be the most addictive game ever created--you just don't have to park yourmind to play it.andM;We congratulate the creators of these products.andP;  They showed us impressivepieces of work, and we expect them to be in the running next year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
