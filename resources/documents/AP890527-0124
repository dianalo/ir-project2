Surrounded by reporters, the Miami man smiled modestly andremained unruffled as he did throughout the hijacking.   ``He was great,'' agreed Albert Saghian, a ladies fashionsalesman from Los Angeles.   Infante's wife Silvia sat patiently while her husband, a33-year-old sales representative for Minolta Business Systems, toldhis story again and again.   ``I thought I wasn't going to get home,'' said Mrs. Infante, whowith her husband was returning from a company-paid vacation inHawaii. ``The beginning was pretty difficult because we didn't knowwhere we were standing. All they would say was the individualwanted to go to Havana.''   Mrs. Infante, 28, said she was proud of her husband's behavioras he relayed messages between the crew and the Spanish-speakinghijacker, identified by the FBI as Pedro Rene Comas-Banos, anescaped mental patient who emigrated from Cuba in the Marielboatlift.   ``I thought he handled it very good, kept himself calm,'' shesaid. ``I think that if he would have been tense, it would havemade it worse.''   She said Infante persuaded the man to release children from theplane and tried to get him to let the women go _ or at least hisown wife.   Comas-Banos allowed children the leave the parked Boeing 727,and Infante and other negotiators talked him into surrenderingminutes later. Infante offered to accompany the man from the plane,but the crew wouldn't allow it.   Lenny Anyia, a high school math teacher in Hawthorne, Calif.,sat across from Infante and Comas-Banos and said the hijackerdidn't act strangely.   ``I dismissed him almost from the moment we took off,'' he said,adding, ``Eli, he was great.''   Mrs. Infante said she and her husband would pick up their twosmall sons at her sister-in-law's house, then go home and rest.   ``Thank God it's a long weekend,'' she said.   When asked if she would fly again, she laughed and replied,``It'll be a long time.'' </TEXT></DOC>
