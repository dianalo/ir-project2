The move by the Liberal Democratic Party is a concession to theincreasingly strident opposition, which has boycotted parliamentarysessions to back demands that Nakasone testify.   Prosecutors on Thursday searched the homes and offices of a keyformer aide to the former prime minister and anotherparliamentarian. The two politicians are suspected of taking bribesto help Recruit Co., an information and publishing conglomerate.   Nakasone previously refused to testify before Parliament on theissue, but Liberal Democratic officials said he will go before thelegislators next week, probably on Wednesday. He has deniedwrongdoing.   Nakasone was prime minister in 1986, when 160 influentialpoliticians, bureaucrats and businessmen _ including severalNakasone aides _ purchased Recruit stock at a bargain price andthen quickly sold it after it went on the market for a much higherprice.   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita announced on April 25 that hewould resign to take responsibility for the Recruit scandal. Pollshad shown support for Takeshita and his Liberal Democrats atall-time lows.   The opposition demand for Nakasone's testimony stiffened afterthe Liberal Democrats rammed the fiscal 1989 budget through thelower house in its absence. The quick vote on April 28 defied thetraditional Japanese emphasis on consensus.   Aside from the stock deals, the opposition wants to questionNakasone about help allegedly given to Recruit by Japan'stelecommunications giant, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.   Former NTT Chairman Hisashi Shinto is among 14 businessmen andbureaucrats arrested so far in the Recruit case.   The two politicians' whose homes were searched Thursday werealso interrogated for two days by prosecutors. They are the firstelected officials against whom such formal legal action has beentaken.   To arrest the two, prosecutors would need permission fromParliament, since the legislature is now in session.   The two are Takao Fujinami, an eight-term member of the House ofRepresentatives who was chief Cabinet secretary under Nakasone, andKatsuya Ikeda of the opposition Komeito (Clean Government Party).   Fujinami, 56, has acknowledged that an aide in 1986 bought12,000 Recruit shares at a discounted price before the company'sstock was publicly traded. After public trading began, the stockwas sold for a profit of $191,000.   Ikeda, 51, a four-term member of the House of Representatives,said his brother bought 5,000 shares in the firm and gained $73,530from the transaction.   In both cases, the politicians denied personal involvement inthe transactions, although news reports said the bulk of theprofits had gone into their bank accounts.   In all, Recruit sold bargain shares to about 160 influentialpoliticians, bureaucrats and businessmen.   Ikeda said Tuesday that he would resign his Parliament seat.Governing party officials denied reports that Fujinami also wouldresign but indicated he might have to step down if he is formallycharged.   The Liberal Democrats still are trying to find a new primeminister who is untainted by the scandal.</TEXT></DOC>
