A notice handed down by the party Politburo, a topdecision-making body, also ordered an end to the banquets, bribes,foreign jaunts and luxury cars enjoyed by many high officials, andput limits on what their children can do for a living.   The notice, read on the national television news, said thePolitburo acted ``to inspire party spirit and the people'saspirations by starting first from the leaders in the party CentralCommittee and the State Council.'' The State Council is China'scabinet.   It called for a spirit of ``hard work and plain living,'' one ofthe leadership's favorite slogans since it crushed studentpro-democracy protests in June and purged party General SecretaryZhao Ziyang.   The protests showed public confidence in the leadership to be atan all-time low, as hundreds of thousands of people rallied to thestudents' slogan, ``Oppose corruption.''   Among other things, the students lampooned children of highofficials who enjoy high posts in government and business,including Deng's son, Deng Pufang, whom they nicknamed ``PrincePufang.''   The Politburo, ordering that corruption be investigated ``nomatter who'' is involved, said a company linked to Deng Pufang willbe disbanded.   The Kang Hua Development Corp. was formed under the auspices ofthe younger Deng's China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped, and itallegedly used the connection to evade taxes while developing intoone of China's largest foreign trade companies.   The Politburo also ordered an audit of the China InternationalTrade and Investment Corp., the country's leading company forattracting foreign investment.   It gave the spouses and children of ``high officials'' untilSept. 1 to resign from jobs in goods distribution companies but didnot list any names. The Politburo notice also:   _Ordered a shake-up of state companies dealing in foreign trade,material supplies and finance.   _Banned party Politburo, Secretariat and State Council personnelfrom driving imported cars and exchanging banquets and gifts paidfor with state funds.   _Said all trips abroad by ``leading officials'' should be forwork only, not ``inspection,'' an apparent euphemism for tourism.   _Ordered an end to the practice of providing special supplies ofscarce food items to high officials and said they would have to buyall their food at the market price instead of at discount.   As early as the 1960s, the public image of China's Communistleaders had changed from that of spartan revolutionaries to apampered elite. But it took the economic decentralization of thepast decade and rapid growth in incomes to add bribery and blackmarketeering to the list of official privileges.   The party has issued repeated orders in recent years to cutspending on luxuries and crack down on corruption, all with littleeffect. However, none of the orders have been as sweeping.   The latest move also comes in a crisis atmosphere, as partyleaders warn that the student movement disclosed weaknesses inparty organization and political education.</TEXT></DOC>
