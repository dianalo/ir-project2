The Europeans want the meeting to spur further improvement inU.S.-Soviet relations, but they seemingly would be satisified if itsimply avoided any slippage in the momentum toward broader armscontrol.   ``For the Europeans in this case, specific agreements are lessimportant than atmospherics,'' said Ivo Dalder, a nuclear armsspecialist at the London-based International Institute forStrategic Studies.   The U.S. allies say they are only mildly disappointed that nodeal on deep cuts in long-range nuclear arms will be struck duringthe Sunday-Thursday summit between President Reagan and SovietCommunist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.   They're pleased that both sides have pledged to continuebargaining after the meeting.   ``It's not the date that's important but the political will tocontinue on the path'' started at the 1986 U.S.-Soviet summit inIceland, where outlines of a deal on strategic, or long-range,missiles were worked out, said Jacques Poos, the foreign ministerof Luxembourg.   Of more concern to the European allies is the timing of Senateratification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF,treaty eliminating the superpowers' intermediate-range missiles.The accord was signed at last December's superpower summit inWashington.   The U.S. missiles to be eliminated under the INF treaty arebased in Western Europe.   The Europeans see Reagan's fourth meeting with Gorbachev as achance to inject new momentum into the process of improvingEast-West relations, particularly as it applies to the allies'links with their neighbors in communist Eastern Europe.   A chief European concern is how Gorbachev's efforts to open upparts of Soviet society and restructure the economy will influencedevelopments in Eastern Europe, according to government officials,private defense specialists, NATO diplomats and military plannersinterviewed recently.   This concern has been heightened by the recent wave of laborunrest in Poland triggered by the communist government's latesteconomic reforms.   ``We don't want to base the whole East-West relationship on armscontrol,'' said Peter Corterier, the West German secretary-generalof the North Atlantic Assembly, a NATO support group in Brussels.   Some European leaders, including British Prime Minister MargaretThatcher have said they hope Reagan uses the Moscow meeting toexpress Western support for the social and economic changesGorbachev is trying to make.   The Europeans say they are not worried by the recent slowdown inU.S.-Soviet negotiations on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,which would cut the number of intercontinental nuclear missiles byhalf.   ``You can easily swallow the fact that the START treaty is notthere,'' said Ton Frinking, a member of the Dutch Parliament andpresident of the North Atlantic Assembly. ``That's a pity, but it'sa technical rather than a political problem _ we hope.''   Although none of the superpowers' long-range nuclear weapons isbased in Western Europe they do pose a direct threat to theContinent.   West German Gen. Hans-Henning Sandrart, NATO's senior commanderin central Europe, said recently that even if the superpowers scrapall their medium-range nuclear arms as planned, the Soviets willremain capable of striking European territory with such long-rangeforces as submarine-launched cruise missiles and mobile, land-basedSS-24 and SS-25 missiles.   ``There is still a strategic threat to the depths of WesternEurope,'' he said.   A U.S.-Soviet agreement to cut long-range nuclear weapons by 50percent would not eliminate this threat to NATO territory, but itwould give the Soviets much less flexibility in targeting Europe,Sandrart said.   Having lost hope for a START deal at the Moscow summit, someEuropeans appear at least mildly concerned about a possible setbackin the negotiations, which have been hung up on a variety oftechnical issues as well as Soviet objections to Reagan's StrategicDefense Initiative to develop a space-based defense againstballistic missiles.   ``It's very important that the two superpowers, if they are notactually in agreement, at least agree not to work one against theother,'' Poos said.   The Europeans apparently are not fearful that Reagan will pulloff an unwelcome surprise in his arms control discussions withGorbachev.   France and some other allies are still grumbling about Reagan'sOctober 1986 meeting with Gorbachev in which he discussed a globalelimination of ballistic missiles _ an idea that had not beenstudied by NATO and which the Europeans later called dangerous toWestern security.   ``He must have learned some lessons from his previous summits,''said Frinking, the Dutch parliamentarian.   Others said their concerns about Reagan's performance had beendiminished by evidence that the president appears to understandmore about Soviet desires and intentions than when he first metGorbachev in 1985.   ``He has a more sophisticated view of what's going on in theSoviet Union now,'' said Corterier.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs Fri May 27 and thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
