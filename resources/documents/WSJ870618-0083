Seib and Andy PasztorStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EXECUTIVE (EXE)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The White House rebuked the Justice Department for the &quot;intemperate&quot; tone of its attack on the system of court-appointed independent counsels.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan fully supports the counsels who are investigating several accusations of wrongdoing by the administration and former officials. The rebuke came a day after the Justice Department unleashed a harsh attack on the legality and motives of special counsels.    Mr. Fitzwater asserted that the White House had suggested changes in wording to tone down a letter the Justice Department sent Congress regarding legislation to extend and expand the 1978 Ethics in Government Act, which created independent counsels. But, he said, the department didn't make the changes.    &quot;I think it's fair to say that we share some of their concerns about the law&quot; that created the position of independent counsel, Mr. Fitzwater said. &quot;We would not have expressed it in quite that fashion.&quot;    On Tuesday, Assistant Attorney General John Bolton said during a news conference that pending investigations by such independent prosecutors are too expensive, cumbersome and unfair. He criticized Lawrence Walsh, the prosecutor in the Iran-Contra affair, for excessive spending to rent office space.    It is unusual for such sniping between the White House and a cabinet agency to be made public. But the episode illustrated that the Justice Department's attack put the White House in an awkward position.    President Reagan has consistently said he wants to cooperate with Mr. Walsh's investigation of the Iran-Contra affair and hopes he discovers all facts surrounding the scandal. The administration has supported, or even requested, other special counsels.    Mr. Bolton also criticized what he called the &quot;extraordinary role&quot; of some federal judges in defending the constitutionality of the current law, while asserting that independent prosecutors often pursue &quot;every lead, every possible violation, every picky little concern,&quot; even if there is &quot;only the flimsiest of evidence.&quot;    Justice Department officials yesterday declined to comment on the White House response.    Before the White House statements, Mr. Bolton and other Justice Department officials asserted that White House aides had cleared their general comments on the issue, along with a sharply worded letter to Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.). Sen. Levin is chairman of a Governmental Affairs subcommittee that is expected to vote soon on legislation reauthorizing the 1978 law that created such independent prosecutors.    Mr. Fitzwater acknowledged that the letter was sent to the White House, but said officials there didn't know in advance that Mr. Bolton planned to level such sharp criticism at the news conference. </TEXT></DOC>
