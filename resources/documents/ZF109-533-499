 Anybody who predicts the future isinvariably wrong.andP;  I'll make a few guesses, though.andP;  Three years from now, Ithink most computers will be [connected to] simple dumb terminals, maybe withwindows, [for people who do] just mail writing and word processing.andP;  More andmore people are getting their fill of floppy disks and their management.andM;For those who really do computing at the desk, the desktop computer will seemto have unlimited MIPS.andP;  The mainframe and the servers will have a lot fewerMIPS.andP;  With MIPS in a server and a mainframe, you're limited by bandwidthproblems, which are very expensive.andM;FEGREUS: Will this invert the classic pyramid in terms of raw CPU power,making the server the low guy on the totem pole?andM;OLSEN: In MIPS, but I wouldn't call it power.andP;  Power is in disk speed andnumber of mounted disks, and memory speed and amount of memory, and bandwidthin and out.andM;FEGREUS: What about applications?andM;OLSEN: First of all, what you can do with pictures is wonderful, and thensome of the things like voice recognition and natural languages.andP;  But theseall devour an enormous amount [of bandwidth, speed, and memory].andM;FEGREUS: Do you see room for continuing the price/performance improvements insilicon that have been almost on an order of magnitude annually?andM;OLSEN: Oh yes.andP;  There are areas that are harder yet, like making disks.andO;[Disks] keep getting better.andP;  The size and price of the disks, the size andprice of the memory, and the size and speed of the computers are verycritical.andM;FEGREUS: What about the software side, in terms of how we interact with theoperating system or use our applications?andP;  You mentioned voice recognitionand natural language.andM;OLSEN: The limitation is deciding what we want.andP;  You can have anything, butyou may not want any more than you have today.andP;  There are a few veryimportant exceptions.andP;  But in general when you sit at your computer it's notclear you want to talk to it.andP;  The keyboard is a very efficient way ofgetting in [to the computer].andM;FEGREUS: What about turning the mid-to upper-level managers loose to look fordata in databases?andM;OLSEN: Here, again, the problem is more deciding what you want.andP;  Wantingsomething simple is inconsistent with wanting all the features.andP;  But I don'tthink that these are technology questions: these are [a matter of]understanding what people want.andM;FEGREUS: For users who are now deep in the midst of network systems, whereare mixed operating systems taking the computer environment?andM;OLSEN: People follow the standards.andP;  The network should be independent of theoperating system and the computer.andP;  We use both VMS and Unix interchangeablyon the network and then we get transferred information from MS-DOS and OS/2and Apple.andM;FEGREUS: How broad a charter do you see or the Open Software Foundation todevelop an open software environment?andP;  Should it address only the kernel ofthe Unix operating system, or look to a much broader scope?andM;OLSEN: In one sense you could say that the kernel is unimportant.andP;  If youfollow the standards they list and the standards they'll maintain and grow tosome degree, you should have transportable software.andM;Have you seen the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) proposal?andP;  ItsMultivendor Integration Architecture sounds like we wrote it.andP;  We were partof the consulting team.andP;  If you follow their standards, applications willplay on anybody's operating system and hardware.andM;Then they, the largest corporation in the world, can buy computers fromanybody.andP;  Sometimes they want one small and cheap, fairly reliable, andsometimes ultimate reliability and size and robustness--the same applicationswill play anywhere if you follow those rules.andP;  And those rules are prettymuch the OSF rules.andM;When you follow the same set of rules, anybody's equipment on any operatingsystem will work on the network.andP;  That's of course our pitch.andP;  When peopleask, we say that's what standards are.andP;  Unix is not a standard.andP;  Nothing istransportable on Unix on the network at all.andM;And then [NTT goes] into great detail on the workstation.andP;  They specify theworkstation so that you could move from workstation to workstation--anymanufacturer, any operating system--and they'll all feel the same.andM;We say one more thing: On a desk top you want everything available.andP;  Whetheryou want it or not, people insist on it.andP;  And we'll make it all play onnetworks.andP;  We don't press the standardization of the workstations as much as[NTT has]; maybe we should.andP;  But [the NTT proposal is] a clear expression ofwhat those standards mean.andP;  They don't mention Unix or any operating systemor any hardware or any architecture.andM;Now it turns out that the [operating system] kernel is important for tworeasons.andP;  It is emotionally important to people, to get settled.andP;  Being up inthe air worries people.andP;  Much more than it's worth.andP;  And those who areworried have no idea why it is important.andP;  They just think it's magic thateveryone agrees on System V or something.andP;  And there's no magic.andM;And the other part of it is that it would help if the kernel were the same;things are easier to do.andP;  And if the kernel is the same, some of the testingthat you have to do would be.andP;  But from the theory point of view, the kernelis not the important issue.andP;  The standards are.andM;FEGREUS: So in terms of the standards that are being set by OSF, you wouldsee no difference--if VMS meets those standards--between an end user pickingVMS or the operating system that OSF puts together?andM;OLSEN: That's right.andP;  Now the difference comes about between all the featuresbuilt into the operating system.andP;  So you like to keep jobs on Unix where thefreedom and creativity and simplicity in OSF [is desirable].andP;  And CPUs runfaster on Unix, which we think will disappear soon.andP;  [When] people want touse a robust system that will really bring them [a lot of features], then yougive them VMS.andM;FEGREUS: What is the enabling technology that'll bring the power that Unixnow has over VMS to VMS?andM;OLSEN: In terms of speed of the chip, just time.andP;  Every machine we build isgetting closer.andP;  It's more the compiler technology, operating system changes,and learning what made RISC fast.andP;  Something that we should have understoodright away.andP;  So the VAX 9000 is close to being discontinued.andM;By compiler technology I mean that the operating system takes whatever thecomputer is, and makes it look to the outside world like a VAX.andP;  Every VAXwe've made is completely different from every other VAX.andP;  And one says thesame of the compiler.andP;  In other words, that's the part you change.andP;  Whateverit takes to make a RISC VAX look like a VAX.andM;FEGREUS: With the desk top moving into the range of 100 VUPs, will the termsupercomputer become obsolete?andM;OLSEN: The definition of supercomputer--which I'm getting away from a littlebit because IBM did--is the most computer you can get at any price.andP;  For goodmoney you can always get something faster.andP;  And [supercomputers] alsonormally want quite high bandwidth.andP;  They have to get a lot of data in andout.andP;  That's all, that's often the limiting factor.andP;  For those for whom [I/Obandwidth] is not the limiting factor, workstations do pretty well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
