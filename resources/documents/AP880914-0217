Paula Parkinson,Jessica Hahn, Rita Jenrette and Debra Murphree did.   Getting scandal-entangled women to bare all is a major coup formen's magazines, which pay hundreds of thousands of dollars totitillate.   Besides dangling six-figure fees, such magazines as Playboy andPenthouse wine and dine these formerly obscure women and offer thepromise of nationwide publicity. The reason is simple: scandalsells.   ``Women, or even men who are at the center of a storm, of anykind, are always best-sellers,'' said Penthouse publisher BobGuccione.   When Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle was chosen as the Republican vicepresidential candidate, Penthouse and Playboy rushed to resurrectfeatures on Paula Parkinson, the comely blond lobbyist whoaccompanied Quayle and two other politicians on a golf outing eightyears ago.   Playboy's November issue includes new coments from Parkinson,claiming Quayle propositioned her on the Florida weekend, and anude photograph of Parkinson taken in 1980.   Penthouse's story, also for November, includes fresh remarksfrom a 1981 interview about an alleged dalliance with Rep. JackKemp, R-N.Y., as well as statements about Quayle.   ``The idea behind this is to get somebody who's in the publiceye ... and show something about that person that you can't findany place else,'' said Nat Lehrman, a former Playboy publishingexecutive and now chairman of Columbia College's journalism schoolhere.   Jessica Hahn, the former church secretary whose sexual encounterwith Jim Bakker led to the PTL evangelist's downfall last year, gother second Playboy feature in the September issue.   Her first spread appeared in Playboy's November 1987 issue,featuring several nude photographs and Hahn's version of whathappened with Bakker. The issue sold more than 5 million copies atnewsstands, about 1.5 million more than usual.   Hahn contends Penthouse offered her $12 million to appear. Shechose instead to tell her story to Playboy for a rumored $1 million.   ``Playboy approached me and Penthouse (too) pretty much when thestory broke,'' Hahn, 29, said in a telephone interview fromPhoenix, where she's working in radio.   Penthouse, she said, ``was making a lot of promises that theycould not keep. The money was endless. I mean it was ridiculous.''   Playboy contends Hahn and an agent first approached themagazine, which Hahn denies. Regardless of who made the first move,Playboy acknowledges she was a big catch.   ``If there is another magazine out there that we feelcompetitive with ... we try to get our offer on the table first,and I think there was probably some of that that went on withJessica Hahn,'' said Jeff Cohen, managing photo editor for Playboy.   Penthouse struck it rich with its July issue, featuring thewoman at the center of the scandal involving televangelist JimmySwaggart. The magazine includes explicit photos of Debra Murphreeshowing the things she contends Swaggart asked her to do in a motelroom.   The Murphree issue sold out in five days, selling more than 4million copies, double the normal newsstand sales, according toPenthouse officials.   Guccione and an attorney for Murphree declined to reveal howmuch she was paid, but it was rumored to be $75,000 to $100,000.   Murphree, jailed in Louisiana on an unrelated prostitutioncharge, was not available for comment. Her attorney Tom Weymann,explained her motivation.   ``Primarily, she was trying to get out of the life that she hadfound herself in. There was the motivation of not only the money,but also to set the record straight of exactly what happened,'' hesaid.   Scandals, especially those involving sex, are guaranteed hitsfor magazines because the public wants ``to see the naked woman whoplayed Delilah to whatever Samson of the moment,'' said BarryBlackman, a New York photographer. Blackman's photographs ofElizabeth Ray, the non-typing secretary and ex-mistress of formerOhio Rep. Wayne Hayes, wound up in Hustler magazine.   Nude photos of Ray also appeared in Penthouse and Playboy.   But capitalizing on scandals can be tricky, said Nancie S.Martin, editor in chief of Playgirl magazine. ``You have to get topeople at the right time. You have to pay them a lot of money. Youhave to hope it's still a scandal when the magazine comes out.   ``There's always the concern that it might be exploitive, thatyou might be taking somebody involved in a sex scandal and givingthem more limelight than they deserve,'' she said.   Often, posing nude is a way for women linked to scandal tocreate or advance careers, said Martin. But why would someone likeRita Jenrette, ex-wife of former South Carolina Congressman JohnJenrette, want to bare her body to millions?   ``I thought it would be a hoot, a funny thing to do,'' saidJenrette, 38, who appreared in Playboy in April 1981 after herhusband's bribery and conspiracy conviction in the FBI Abscaminvestigation.   ``People caught in the midst of turmoil, you do a lot ofuncharacteristic things,'' said Jenrette, now living in New Yorkand pursuing an acting career. ``I never anticipated thecriticism.''   She said a Washington reporter and his wife persuaded her topose, and Playboy says it willingly agreed.   ``There is a curiosity about these people that the other newsmedia pick up. Rita Jenrette was everywhere,'' Cohen said. ``(But)we had her story, and we had glamorous nude photographs of her.''   The issue featuring Jenrette sold a little more than 6.2 millioncopies, more than a million over normal sales of the time.   ``It was one of our biggest sellers,'' Cohen said.   Jenrette says she doesn't think Playboy exploited her troublesto make a buck.   As far as men's magazines making money off the scandal, shesaid, ``What else is there? It sells. ... The sensational grabspeople.''   That's why Playboy and Penthouse, offering six-figure payoffs,hotly pursued Donna Rice, whose relationship with former ColoradoSen. Gary Hart doomed his presidential hopes, and Fawn Hall, theblond National Security Council secretary who helped Oliver Northshred and alter documents about arms deals in the Iran-Contrascandal.   ``Donna Rice I think we were close to making a deal with at onepoint,'' said Playboy's Cohen. ``Nudity was discussed. She justwalked away from it. There were several conversations with her,lunches ... but no deal was made. Why she turned us down, I don'tknow. ...   ``Fawn Hall ... would have certainly been a cover (story), wouldhave sold well,'' Cohen said.   Playboy would not disclose their offers, but Guccione saidPenthouse offered Rice about $350,000 and Hall $250,000 ``becauseanybody in the country would want to read'' about them.   Hall's attorney, Plato Cacheris, said he understood the interestin his client.   But ``the money did not tempt her,'' he said. ``She's too muchof a lady ... and she's not going to try to capitalize in anyunseemly way.''   Rice could not be reached and her Miami attorney, ThomasMcAliley was vacationing and unavailable to explain why sherejected the offers.   Should she or Hall have second thoughts, it may be too late.   ``The timing is all-important,'' said Cohen. ``Right now, Idon't think either of them have much value.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, Sept. 19</NOTE></DOC>
