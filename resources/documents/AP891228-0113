(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Harvard University, the first Ivy Leagueschool, has become the last to try to protect its name with atrademark after years of seeing it emblazoned on sweatshirts andother goods around the world.   Under new licensing procedures, towels, watches and boxer shortsfor the Crimson may still be allowed.   But string bikinis? Maybe not.   ``We just don't want it to be outrageous,'' said Ellen Mitchellof the Harvard Office of Patents, Copyrights and Licensing. ``Wedon't want to look silly.''   More than 100 U.S. colleges and universities already issuelicenses for the use of their names, including the seven other IvyLeague colleges, according to the office of Robert Scott, vicepresident for finance.   Margot Naulleau, international licensing coordinator forChampion Products Inc., one of the main suppliers of athletic wearwith college insignias, said Harvard _ America's oldest college _was one of the last major schools in the nation to seek a trademark.   ``It's simply that we are very old and very conservative. Ittook us a long time to decide if it was something that we ought todo,'' said Joyce Brinton, director of the Harvard patent office.She said there was no incident that led to the decision to apply,such as a particularly egregious product on the market.   ``It was just that the time has come,'' she said.   Before the Harvard Corporation decided in June to apply for atrademark on their name from the U.S. Patent and TrademarkingOffice, Brinton's office had inquiries from many manufacturersabout getting a license.   Brinton said the trademark has not yet been approved but shedidn't anticipate any problems.   ``I think most of the companies have felt uncomfortable thatthey don't have a license from Harvard,'' she said. Those companiesworried about being left with hundreds of products if the school'slawyers suddenly cracked down, she said.   Harvard ran a few trial programs before moving toward licensingon a broad scale. At the school's 350th anniversary in 1986,Harvard wanted to ensure commemorative items were of high quality.Another program licensing the trademark in Japan has been booming,bringing in $130,000 in royalties annually.   Under the new licensing procedure, if someone wants to make aproduct bearing the name Harvard, Harvard University, or theschool's insignia, he must first show designs and samples todemonstrate the quality of the product before Harvard will grant alicense.   And the cost of renting the Harvard name? A bargain, Mitchellsaid. Brinton said companies that market Harvard products pay aflat fee of $300 and sales royalties of 7{ percent.   Only a few licenses have been distributed so far. After a coupleof years, officials expect from $300,000 to $500,000 to come in ayear. But with an endowment of some $4.5 billion, the income fromlicensing is a drop in the bucket.</TEXT></DOC>
