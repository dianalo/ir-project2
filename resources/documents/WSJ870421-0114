And Congress is about to ask the drug makers to explain.    At a hearing in Washington today, the House subcommittee on health and environment will present figures showing that drug prices in 1986 on average rose about 8%, almost four times greater than the 2.1% rate of inflation for all consumer goods. Since 1983, the yearly average increase for prescription drugs was 9.7%, almost three times greater than the 3.4% average increase in inflation, according to the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even more dramatic, wholesale drug prices have climbed by about 9.5% a year since 1983, while wholesale prices of all goods rose barely more than 1% a year.    Rep. Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, says the difference in the rate of increases is &quot;very hard to justify.&quot; He adds, &quot;The companies are taking advantage of the fact that people need their products.&quot; The growth in prices, subcommittee staff members assert, especially burdens the elderly on fixed incomes, who represent a significant portion of prescription drug consumers.    Drug industry officials, meanwhile, say the accusations are unfair. They say the increases reflect the widening cost of discovering and testing new drugs. Moreover, they say that differences in the rates of increase between drug prices and inflation are distorted: Depressed oil prices make inflation seem lower than it really is.    While industry officials acknowledge that drug prices have jumped in recent years, they argue that the daily cost to consumers of a prescription drug still is low when compared with the cost of other goods and other medical services.    American Home Products Corp.'s Ayerst Laboratories, for instance, has raised the price of its popular heart drug, Inderal, by an average 14% a year since 1984. But while the drug's typical daily cost to a patient has jumped to about 50 cents a day, from about 35 cents in 1984, &quot;that's still pretty low when you compare it to the price of a cup of coffee or a ride on a bus,&quot; says Judson St. John, Ayerst's president.    Privately, some drug company executives are indignant about the fuss over prices. They complain that today's hearings, and similar ones held by Rep. Waxman two years ago, represent political grandstanding. In fact, the congressman, a self-described liberal who in recent years has developed a reputation as an industry watchdog, says he doesn't expect Congressional action to result from his hearings. Instead, he says, &quot;We just want the American people to see what's going on.&quot;    What Rep. Waxman and other industry critics are particularly concerned about is drug companies setting very high prices on products for which there are no alternatives.    Recently, Burroughs-Wellcome Co. set off a firestorm of controversy when it priced its AZT drug for treating complications from acquired immune deficiency syndrome at between $8,000 and $10,000 for a year's dose. The company won't explain how it arrived at the figures; industry analysts suggest it was priced to be about the same as very expensive cancer therapy.    Drug-industry critics also note that where competition among similar-acting drugs once drove prices down, it now seems to drive prices up, at least in the short term for the most popular brand-name medicines. &quot;Normal economics would dicate a lowering of price to hold on to market share, but that doesn't happen,&quot; says Albert Wertheimer, a professor at University of Minnesota's College of Pharmacy. &quot;I don't understand why. It's a quirk of the drug industry,&quot; he adds.    Robert Uhl, an analyst with the brokerage Eberstadt Fleming Inc., provides one explanation. &quot;There's a feeling in the industry that growing generic competition and a recent trend in high-volume purchasing of drugs by insurers is going to eventually choke off the ability to raise prices,&quot; he says. &quot;So they're doing it while they can.&quot;    Again, consider Inderal. In August 1985, the drug's patent expired allowing a host of cheaper-priced generic copies to flood the market. Ayerst immediately lost 13% of the market. But by raising Inderal's price 20%, the company's revenue from the drug in 1985 was $420 million, about the same as the year earlier. Last year, however, it raised the price another 16% and its market share fell to about 60% and its revenue fell to $251 million.    Companies defend the increases, saying research and development has become exorbitantly expensive and that the companies must rely on their big-selling products to finance it. Gerald Mossinghoff, president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, says that in 1986, the drug companies pumped $4.6 billion into research and development, 12% more than in 1985.    House subcommittee staffers, however, say a survey they recently conducted of 25 drug makers found that between 1982 and 1986 the dollar increase in drug prices was three times greater than dollar increases that were spent on research and development. The survey also found that much of the money companies spent on development went for so-called &quot;copy-cat&quot; versions of already successful drugs. </TEXT></DOC>
