(mechanical computer-aided design)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Gantz, John.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>One of the markets served by mechanical computer-aided engineering(MCAE) is analysis and design, a segment that is defined by twotrends: more products are running on more platforms, and more ofthese products are being integrated into mainstream CAD programs.andO;MCAE's growing popularity is further enhanced by developments suchas the availability of cheaper machines that run sophisticatedanalysis routines, and the introduction of mainframe-like toolsthat run on microcomputers.andP;  Industry analysts have forecasted anear 20 percent growth rate for the total $500 million MCAEsoftware market, even as the predicted growth rate for the totalmechanical computer-aided design (MCAD) market is pegged at onlyeight percent.andP;  Examples of trends in the industry areMacNeal-Schwendler's MSC-DYNA finite-element-analysis program andStructural Dynamics Research Corp's I-DEAS integrated designpackage.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Mechanical EngineeringComputer-Aided DesignMarket AnalysisTrendsComputer-Aided EngineeringFinite Element MethodStructured Design Techniques.andO;Feature:   illustrationgraph.andO;Caption:   How MCAE fits into MCAD: worldwide revenues, 1988, 1993.
