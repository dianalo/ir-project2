It has no stable isotopes and its longest-lived radioactiveisotopes with half-lives of several hours can be produced only via nuclearreactions. Its behaviour and properties can be studied only on a tracerscale, making use of radiochemical methods. The considerable attentionpaid to the chemistry of this element stems mainly from the potentialapplication in tumour therapy of the {alpha}-emitting /sup 221/At-isotopewhose half-life is 7.2 hours. Its tumour destroying effect, when administeredlocally, has been proved by utilizing /sup 211/At-tellurium colloid.Recently, the main efforts have been directed towards preparing such/sup 211/At-labelled carriers stabe in vivo, which metabolically coulddeliver and localize the {alpha}-emitter selectively to the tumour cells.</TEXT></DOC>
