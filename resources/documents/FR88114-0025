Klein, Director, TSCAAssistance Office (TS-799), Office of Toxic Substances; Room E-543, 401M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460 (202) 544-1404.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 29, 1987 (52 FR 20336), EPA issued a proposedrule for 73 Office of Solid Waste chemicals which included testing forchemical fate and human health effects. EPA previously extended the commentperiod in a document published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 7, 1987 (52 FR 29395). EPA is reopeningthe comment period to permit comment on: (1) Data documenting potentialfor exposure to certain chemicals; (2) toxicity data on one chemical; and(3) an updated economic assessment for chemicals for which there previouslywas insufficient or no available economic information. The non-confidentialexposure, economic, and toxicity information is now available for reviewin the public docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background </ITAG>The proposed rule required testing for human health effects (90-day subchronictoxicity) and/or chemical fate (anaerobic biodegradation, hydrolysis, andsoil sorption), depending on identified data gaps for each chemical. EPA'sOffice of Solid Waste needs these data to support its effort under section3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to identify thosewastes which may pose a substantial hazard to human health and the environmentif improperly managed. The proposed human health effects and chemical fate testing is based onthe authority of section 4(a) (1) (A) of TSCA. EPA finds that the disposalof these chemicals may present an unreasonble risk of injury to healthor the environment; that there are insufficient data and experience todetermine or predict the effects of disposal on health or the environment;and that testing is necessary to develop these data.Comments were received from Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), SyntheticOrganic Chemical Manufacturers Association, Inc. (SOCMA), Vulcan Chemicals,Regulatory Network, Inc. (Maleic Anhydride Consortium), Monsanto Co., MethylChloride Industry Association, Morton Thiokol, Inc., Calorie Control Council,and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), on the basis for thesection 4(a)(1)(A) findings of ``may present an unreasonable risk of injuryto health or the environment'' for the chemicals listed in the proposedrule.All of the chemicals in the proposed rule are listed in Appendix VIII of40 CFR Part 261. NRDC believes that the threshold requirement for beinglisted in Appendix VIII is more than adequate to satisfy the ``may presentan unreasonable risk to health or the environment'' finding required byTSCA, nothing that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Substances will be listed in Appendix VIII only if they have beenshown in scientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogeniceffects on humans or other life forms. 40 CFR 261.11(a).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NRDC believes that, since EPA is basing its decision for a test ruleon the ``unreasonable risk'' finding rather than the ``substantial exposure''finding, there is no requirement for a showing of substantial human exposure.CMA and other industry commenters, however, believe that the general assertion,contained in the proposed rule, that the subject chemicals are known tobe constituents of wastes to which humans might be exposed does not supporta conclusion under TSCA that each of the chemicals may present a hazardor risk.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Exposure Data</ITAG>While EPA believes that the record contains sufficient information to supportits findings, since relevant data are easily available and obtainable withinthe timeframe allowed for this rulemaking, the Agency is now insertinginto the record for this rule data that document the presence of certainchemicals in waste streams and/or ground water, demonstrating potentialfor human exposure. The data show that tens of thousands of pounds of thesechemicals are being released annually via disposal. Also, the type of disposaldescribed in the data bases for the subject chemicals, such as deep wellinjection, discharge to landfill, or discharge to a POTW (publicly-ownedtreatment works), indicate potential for leaching and exposure to thesechemicals. Indeed, data exist for many of the chemicals which documentincidents in which the chemicals have migrated from their place of treatment,storage, or ultimate disposal. It is likely that these data represent onlya portion of actual contamination occurrrences throughout the country.The data have been obtained by searching three data bases used by the Officeof Solid Waste: The Industry Studies Data Base (ISDB), the Hazardous WasteDamage Incident Data Base (DIDB), and the Hazardous Waste Disposal Site(HWDS) Data Base. Many of the chemicals are listed in more than one database. Much of the data contained in the ISDB is RCRA confidential businessinformation (CBI), and is contained in a separate RCRA CBI docket. Thenon-CBI information is available for review in the OPTS docket No. 42088C.The ISDB is a computerized repository of chemical manufacturing and wastemanagement information, established by the Waste Characterization Branchof the Office of Solid Waste in conjunction with the Hazardous Waste ListingProgram. The information was provided directly from chemical manufacturersunder the authority of RCRA section 3007 through questionnaire surveys,sampling and analysis site visits, and from other sources. As mentionedabove, the vast majority of the data relate to proprietary product processesand are classified as CBI.The DIDB presents a nationwide retrospective view of incidents in whichhazardous wastes or products have migrated from their place of treatment,storage, or ultimate disposal. The DIDB was developed to allow the rapididentification of large numbers of incidents illustrating specific typesof contamination scenarios. Presently, the data base contains summariesof nearly 1,000 mismanagement incidents.The HWDS Data Base, developed by EPA's Environmental Monitoring SystemsLaboratory, Las Vegas, NV, contains hazardous waste disposal site groundwatermonitoring data obtained from the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) and the RCRA programsof EPA. Each of the 10 EPA regional offices was visited between April 1983and September 1983, resulting in the acquisition of site investigationdata for 183 Superfund sites. Groundwater data were also obtained for 175interim-status phase RCRA sites from the State of Texas (115 sites), theState of Louisiana (40 sites), and EPA's Office of Solid Waste (20 sites).In addition to groundwater monitoring results for each chemical contaminant,pertinent site data such as classification of site (RCRA, CERCLA), typeof operation (landfill, lagoon, etc.), type of well (private, public watersupply, monitoring), well location (up/downgradient, on-/off-site), samplingdate, and geographic location (regions, state) were also entered into thedata base.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Toxicity Data</ITAG>Toxicity data on one chemical, methanethiol, were inadvertently omittedfrom the docket in support of the proposed test rule. This information,along with exposure data from the ISDB, support the TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A)``may present an unreasonable risk'' finding for this chemical, and arenow available in the docket for public review.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Literature Review</ITAG>CMA asserted in its comments that ``EPA has not conducted a satisfactoryreview of existing data and experience for each chemical, and, therefore,the Agency is unable to reach conclusions about the adequacy of such datafor supporting the proposed section 4 rules.'' In response to this comment,EPA reviewed the literature search document for each endpoint for eachchemical. As a result, EPA is now supplementing the public docket withresults of the literature search for three chemicals, all for the anaerobicbiodegradation rate end-point: Acetamide, 2-fluoro (insufficient data);2,3-dichloropropanol (no data); and 2,6-dinitrotoluene (insufficient data).This information supports the TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A)(ii) finding thatthere are insufficient data and experience upon which the effects of commercialactivity with the subject chemicals on health or the environment can reasonablybe determined or predicted.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Economic Analysis</ITAG>The economic analysis prepared in support of the proposed rule assessedthe potential for significant adverse economic impact of 49 chemicals.The analysis has now been revised to incorporate additional informationconcerning certain of the 49 chemicals and to assess six additional chemicals.The original economic analysis indicated that the potential for significantadverse economic impact may be high for 10 of the 49 chemicals based uponthe expected testing costs for those chemicals. This number has been revisedto nine, with four chemicals removed from this category and three otherchemicals added.For four of those chemicals, 1,3-dichlorobenzene, 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol,2,3-dichloro-1-propanol, and dihydrosafrole, additional market informationhas led EPA to revise its assessment of the potential for significant adverseeconomic impact. It now appears that the potential for significant adverseeconomic impact may be low for these four chemicals. For one chemical previouslyclassified as having a low likelihood of significant adverse economic impact,nicotine, an increase in the estimated testing costs indicates that thechemical should now be classified as having a high likelihood of significantimpact. The original economic analysis also indicated that the potential for significantadverse impact was uncertain for five chemicals. For two of these chemicals,1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene and phenacetin, EPA now believes that the potentialfor significant adverse economic impact is high.For one chemical previously classified as having a low likelihood of significantadverse economic impact, methyl chlorocarbonate, an increase in the estimatedtesting costs indicates that the likelihood is now uncertain.The likelihood of significant adverse economic impact was not addressedin the original economic analysis for 24 chemicals which were believedto be manufactured solely as pesticides or not currently manufactured orimported. For 3 of these 24 chemicals, pentabromoethane, pentabromobenzene,and maleic hydrazide, the probability of significant adverse economic impactis believed to be low. For 4-bromobenzylcyanide and endrin, there is ahigh likelihood of significant adverse economic impact. For 2-chloroethylvinyl ether, the likelihood of significant adverse economic impact is uncertain.Please refer to the revised economic analysis contained in the docket fora more detailed discussion of the economic assessment for these chemicals.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Rulemaking Record</ITAG>EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket number OPTS-42088C).This record includes all information considered in the development of theproposed rule and appropriate <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices. The Agency will continue to supplementthe record with additional information as it is received.The record includes all information referenced in support of the May 29proposal plus the following information:(1) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Solid Waste Chemicals (52 FR 20336;May 29, 1987).(2) Exposure data from three sources: The Industry Studies Data Base, theHazardous Waste Damage Incident Data Base, and the Hazardous Waste DisposalSite Data Base.(3) Revised economic analysis for the proposed rule.(4) Toxicity data on methanethiol.(5) Literature search information for: acetamide, 2-fluoro; 2,3-dichloropropanol;and 2,6-dinitrotoluene.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
