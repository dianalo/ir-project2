The Roster wouldbe operated by the Conference for the benefit of other federal agenciesand parties to disputes involving administrative programs. The Roster isintended to increase agencies' ability expeditiously to locate and retainmediators, trainers, and other apt neutrals across the country by creatinga clearinghouse of basic data and to increase agency officials' awarenessof the availability of alternative means of disputes resolution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before July 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Interested organizations and individuals are invitedto submit written comments to Charles Pou, Jr., Senior Staff Attorney,Administrative Conference of the United States, 2120 L Street, NW., Suite500, Washington, DC 20037.

The Roster will further the Conference'sstatutory mission to serve as a clearinghouse for interchange of informationpotentially useful in improving administrative procedure.The Administrative Conference has repeatedly encouraged agencies to takeadvantage of mediation, negotiation, minitrials, binding arbitration andother alternative means of dispute resolution (``ADR''). Some agencieshave begun to employ these methods to reduce transaction costs and reachbetter results. A key figure in the effective working of various modes of ADR, includingnegotiated rulemaking, is the ``neutral''_a person, usually serving atthe will of the parties, who generally presides and seeks to help the partiesreach a resolution of their dispute. These neutrals, often highly skilledprofessionals with considerable training in techniques of dispute resolution,can be crucial to using ADR methods with success. For agencies to use ADReffectively, they should take steps to develop routines for deciding whenand how these persons can be employed, to identify qualified neutrals,and to acquire their services. The Roster is intended to serve as a repositoryof data that will help agencies and others who employ ADR methods in governmentdisputes to accomplish the following goals: andbullet; Supply. Broadening the base of qualified, acceptable individualsor organizations, inside and outside the government, to provide ADR services.andbullet; Qualifications. Insuring that neutrals have adequate skills, technicalexpertise, experience or other competence necessary to promote settlement,while avoiding being too exclusive in the selection process. andbullet; Acquisition. Expediting methods, or developing new techniques,for expeditiously acquiring the services of neutrals at a reasonable costand in a manner which (a) insures a full and open opportunity to competeand (b) enables agencies to select the most qualified person to serve asa neutral. The Roster will provide agencies and other parties with basic data on neutrals,avoid routine Conference evaluation of neutrals' qualifications and performance,and limit the effort required for the Conference to prepare lists of requestedneutrals. The Conference generally would not try to match neutrals to particulardisputes. Rather, it would generally provide a focused list of likely candidates,taking into account specifications of parties to disputes. This removesthe Conference from most of the subjective decisionmaking in the selectionprocess, while at the same time encouraging parties to become ``informedconsumers'' capable of specifying the characteristics they desire in aprospective neutral. This underscores the need for guidance to the uninitiated;the Conference would provide an explanatory brochure on the Roster's use,offer telephone advice when requested on appropriate use of the Roster,and possibly refer parties to volunteer neutrals for further information.The rules require neutrals to submit certain basic information, and makeadditional submissions optional. Required information, necessary for partiesto obtain a list of likely candidates, would include depth and type ofneutral experience, training, subject-matter expertise, education degrees,present organizational affiliation, and fee schedule. Additional informationthat may be helpful in making a final selection may be submitted, but isnot necessary for listing. All neutrals who supply the basic data will be listed. Given the Conference'sresources and the potential size of the Roster, it is impractical for theConference to investigate and verify all neutrals' applications. The rulesadopt a certification approach used by many agencies which discouragesdishonest submissions while not placing an investigative burden on theagency. At the same time, the Conference reserves the right to verify anyinformation submitted and to remove from the Roster the names of peoplewho falsify information submitted to the Conference. The rules make itclear to parties that the Conference will not guarantee the accuracy ofinformation in its files. The Roster files may be managed on a computer data base system. If so,the Conference expects to cross-reference Roster-listed neutrals accordingto categories that include experience, training, subject-matter expertise,educational degrees, organizational affiliation, and fee schedule.To avoid conflicts of interest for neutrals, the rules require neutralson the Roster to abide by the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolutioncode of conduct that details what a neutral should disclose and how tohandle potential conflicts of interest, as well as any other code thatthe neutral is subject to. The principal of disclosure appears to be themost practical means of discovering and avoiding conflicts of interest.The rules place an obligation on the neutral to act in accordance withethical standards while allowing an up-to-date evaluation by the partiesof the potential for conflict of interest based on the specifics of theirparticular dispute.While the Conference reserves the right to remove neutrals who have falsifiedinformation or otherwise clearly violated accepted ethical standards, itwould not ordinarily evaluate the quality of work by neutrals on the Roster.The Conference would simply disseminate to Roster users the names, addressesand phone numbers of parties in cases handled by each neutral on a panel,and prospective users can carry out their own inquiries. To document andevaluate program effectiveness, the Conference would ask parties to fillout a report card on the Roster program that includes questions regardingthe effectiveness of guidance on choosing a neutral, satisfaction withthe Conference's administrative efforts, and the quality of Roster-listedneutrals in general. Parties may contact Roster staff if they are dissatisfied with the performanceof a particular neutral whose name they obtained from the Conference'sRoster. Only confirmed complaints involving significant violations of ethicalstandards or law would be retained in neutrals' files. The Conference retainsthe right to notify legal authorities if there is reason to suspect illegalactivity has occurred.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, requires thata Regulatory Flexibility Analysis be performed for all rules that are likelyto have ``significant economic impact'' on a substantial number of smallentities. The rule will have no such impact. It provides a wholly voluntaryprocedure by which parties may locate neutrals to help them reach agreement.Alternative dispute resolution techniques should provide a quicker, lessexpensive method of resolution than traditional litigation and negotiation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>, and 5 CFR 1320.13, forms for collection of data frompersons wishing to be listed on the Roster must be submitted to the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. Accordingly, the Conferencewill submit the proposed registration form to OMB, and organizations orindividuals desiring to submit comments regarding the information collectionitems on the form, are requested to direct their comments to (1) the Officeof Information and Regulatory Affairs, Room 3002, New Executive OfficeBuilding, Washington, DC 20503, (2) with a copy to Charles Pou, Jr., AdministrativeConference of the United States, 2120 L Street, NW., Suite 500, Washington,DC 20037.
