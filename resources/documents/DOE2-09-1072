While in the experiments discussedonly a small fraction of repulsive potential is tested, the results obtainedindicate that the procedure will be of superior sensitity to the previouslyused method, involving the measurement of spontaneous emission-generatedwings. A precise tracking of repulsive potentials is projected to bepossible on the basis of the procedure first suggested by Telle (1986).20 references.</TEXT></DOC>
