Julian M. Seidel, the failed thrift's former president, and James R. Porter, a former senior vice president, were charged in the 22-count indictment with fraud and tax evasion. Separately, Edward A. Dacy, the thrift's former counsel, was accused of interstate transportation of stolen property and filing a false income-tax return.    None of the former officials or their attorneys could be reached for comment.    According to the indictment, the 53-year-old Mr. Seidel and the 41-year-old Mr. Porter conspired to defraud First Maryland depositors by making insider loans, filing false reports to regulators and making false statements to the public, among other offenses.    The indictment describes a pattern of &quot;exorbitant&quot; salary and bonuses paid to Mr. Seidel. It also outlines a series of loans allegedly arranged by Mr. Seidel to his friends as &quot;straw borrowers&quot; who funneled proceeds back to him to pay off his personal debts.    Mr. Dacy, 50, who negotiated a pre-indictment plea agreement, faces a total of 13 years in prison and a fine of $350,000.    U.S. Attorney Breckinridge L. Willcox, who announced the results of his office's two-year investigation of the case, called the alleged offenses &quot;crimes of greed, pure and simple.&quot;    In August 1985, First Maryland was found to be an unsound institution and was forced into receivership by state authorities. As of Sept. 30, 1988, about 2,700 First Maryland depositors were still owed $118.8 million plus about $25.8 million in accrued interest. </TEXT></DOC>
