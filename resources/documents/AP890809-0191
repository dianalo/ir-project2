Bush, in a question and answer session with reporters, remindedIran of his Inauguration Day message that ``goodwill will begetgoodwill'' and said he could send no ``clearer signal'' of hisinterest to win the release of American hostages and forge a newrelationship with Tehran.   The president said the lives of the hostages are ``too preciousfor me to be sticking my head in the sand and miss some subtlety inthis highly complicated corner of the world.''   His comments were the latest turn in a series of remarks by Bushand Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, both of whom haveused public forums in recent days to discuss the internationaldiplomatic stirrings aimed at freeing the western hostages held inBeirut.   On Tuesday, the Tehran Times indicated that Rafsanjani wouldhelp obtain freedom for the hostages if the United States releasedbillions of dollars in Iranian assets impounded a decade ago.   The administration has rejected linking the hostages and theassets, and Bush said, ``My view is to do nothing that will be seenas quid pro quo for hostages.''   Bush said there were mixed signals from Iran about itsintentions. As for himself, he recalled the rhetorical open hand heextended to Tehran on the day he took office.   ``I'm not talking about terms, I'm talking about talking to getpeople out that are held against their will,'' he said. ``And Ithink I covered that pretty well in my inaugural address when Isaid goodwill will beget goodwill. And if ever there was a clearersignal, in my view that's it.   ``So I repeat it,'' Bush said. ``And if there are changes takingplace (in Iran) and signals that are shifting, I don't want to missa signal.''   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said theadministration was ``being very careful with our language, tryingto keep the possibility of dialogue open. We want to be encouragingof improved relations with Iran.''   Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir telephoned Bush.   Shamir's adviser, Avi Pazner said the prime minister repeatedIsrael's position that it will free Shiite Moslem cleric SheikAbdul Karim Obeid only in exchange for three Israeli soldiers heldin Lebanon and ``all the hostages.''   Sixteen Western hostages are held in Lebanon, including eightAmericans.   The call was originiated by Shamir, according to a seniorIsraeli official speaking on condition that he not be identified.He said Shamir felt Bush would ``appreciate the personal contact.''   In Washington, the president and other administration leadersdenied that the United States was shifting its policy about the wayit deals with terrorists and kidnappers.   Bush's administration _ and Ronald Reagan's before him _ hadflatly ruled out any negotiations, but Bush seemed to hint at somechange in an interview Tuesday with The Boston Globe.   He told the newspaper, ``We do not negotiate in any way that'sgoing to jeopardize the lives of other Americans'' _ a statementthat seemed to suggest that some form of negotiations would beacceptable.   Fitzwater said there was no change in policy. He said theadministration had come up with the new phrasing for the policy``to give definition to it because everybody else has tried to doit for us.''   Bush, in his meeting with reporters in the Oval Office, said,``I don't think there's any subtle change'' from the position ofthe Reagan administration.   ``I'm not going to do anything that would put some otherAmerican _ perhaps in some other place, at some other time _ atrisk, and that means trading off or negotiating for hostages,'' thepresident said.   Bush added, ``I hope I'm open-minded enough to talk and toexercise every diplomatic channel I can to free these Americans.... No American is going to be content until these people are free.And I would not be doing my job if I didn't approach it in thatmanner.''   The president said the United States would continue to press adiplomatic effort on the hostages' behalf, reaching out to as manycountries as possible.   Bush said some countries previously on the sidelines of thehostage crisis now are giving assistance to the United Statesbecause they are ``infuriated or angered or repulsed'' by avideotape purporting to show the hanging of Marine Lt. Col. WilliamR. Higgins and another videotape showing American hostage JosephCicippio urging the release of a Moslem cleric who was kidnapped byIsrael.   ``They've been so offended by that, regardless of their view onthe politics of the Middle East or any other area, that we arefinding more and more of a willingness to help,'' Bush said.   In his interview with the Globe, Bush noted that Fitzwater haddescribed him as cautiously optimistic about the hostages but thepresident went on to add in the interview, ``I have no reason tosay that I can see, in a short run, a total resolution of theholding of American-hostage problem.''   He said Wednesday, ``I'm conducting the foreign policy of thiscountry in a prudent manner that I hope will get these people outof there. But the last thing I want to do is elevate the hopes ofthese families who have been disappointed over and over again tohave those hopes dashed.''   Bush invited the press to the Oval Office as he posed forpictures with Cardinal Bernard Law, the Roman Catholic leader fromBoston. Bush urged Americans to say a prayer this weekend for thehostages and their families.</TEXT></DOC>
