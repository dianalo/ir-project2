The warrants, which expire Feb. 1, 1990, allow holders to buy one common share at a price of $17.625 and were originally issued as part of a $50 million senior debt issue in 1985. The tender offer is scheduled to end at 12 p.m. CDT June 9.    Cronus, which provides data processing services to local governments, said the planned offer &quot;is being made to reduce the potential earnings dilution that could occur if the warrants were to be exercised.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
