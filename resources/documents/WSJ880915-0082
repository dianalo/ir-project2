Typically, when the U.S. seizes real estate under drug-forfeiture laws, it pays off mortgages outstanding to banks that claim they were &quot;innocent owners.&quot; Not, however, in the case of U.S. vs. One Single-Family House at 6960 Miraflores Ave., Coral Gables, Fla. Republic National is owned by Republic Banking Corp. of Florida.    When the U.S. confiscated the waterfront house, held by Thule Holding Corp., a Panamanian corporation, prosecutors balked at satisfying a mortgage. They asserted that Republic Bank knew or should have known it was dealing with a drug dealer who, it maintains, controlled Thule.    In June, Thule acquiesced to forfeiting the leveraged house, valued at $1.1 million. A trial was held in late June on the bank's claim against the property, but federal Judge Thomas Scott has not yet ruled.    Stanley Beiley, an attorney for the bank, said it was an innocent party to the transaction.    The case &quot;could have broad implications for banks,&quot; said Mr. Beiley, who asserts that the proper standard is whether a bank has &quot;actual knowledge&quot; of illegal goings-on -- not whether it &quot;should have known.&quot; An adverse ruling could mean that &quot;banks would have to do exhaustive background checks before making any loans or mortgages,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
