(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A businessman who was a member of thesecret army that won Israel's independence has been grantedclemency to complete his Florida murder sentence on a kibbutz in adeal with the state Cabinet.   William Shapiro, 62, of Miami, has served 13 years of his lifesentence but plans to board an El Al jet Monday evening in Miamiand renounce his U.S. citizenship upon arriving in Israel, hisattorney, Alvin Lodish, said Saturday.   High officials in the Israeli government, Florida legislatorsand others sought clemency for New York-born Shapiro, citing a lackof credibility in the evidence that put him in prison for themurder of business partner Burt deWitt.   They argued a man with Shapiro's distinguished background as acombat officer in the U.S. Marines during World War II and theKorean War, as a 12-year veteran and ballistics officer with theIsraeli National Police and as a liberator of Israel could not havebeen guilty of murder.   ``The evidence just wasn't very strong against Shapiro,'' saidLodish, who was asked by Israel's consul general in Miami, RahaminTimor, to handle the case. ``It is highly unusual to have someoneconvicted of first-degree murder on evidence like that.''   Pleas on Shapiro's behalf were sent by former Israeli Ambassadorto the United States Meir Rosenne, Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kolek,former B'nai B'rith international president William Wexler, and aman who Shapiro says was a member of the Haganah, a Jewish defenseforce formed secretly under British rule to counter Arab attacks.It became the core of the Israeli army after the Jewish state wasfounded in 1948.   A Dade County circuit court jury convicted Shapiro in February1976 of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder.   Shapiro was convicted on the testimony of Larry D. Murren, whopleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 10years in prison in exchange for his testimony, according to courtrecords. Murren was paroled after less than four years.   ``The only real evidence and testimony against Shapiro was thisguy Murren who had admitted he lied initially when he told the FBIhis story,'' said Lodish.   Another co-defendant, Michael Salvatore, was sentenced to deathfor the deWitt murder in 1975, but that was commuted to life inprison in 1981. He remains in jail.   According to Shapiro's legal file, there was never any doubtthat Shapiro didn't participate directly in deWitt's pipe beatingdeath.   Prosecutors claimed he hired Murren and Salvatore to do thedeed, but other evidence suggested the two men killed deWitt anddumped his body at sea so they could steal back a stolen boat theyhad sold to deWitt.   Shapiro needed last month's clemency deal with Gov. Bob Martinezand the independently elected state Cabinet, sitting as the Boardof Executive Clemency, because the United States and Israel have noprisoner-exchange treaty, said Lodish.   Conditions of the agreement require Shapiro to renounce his U.S.citizenship and be relocated at the Kibbutz Ayelet-Hashachar innorthern Israel, where he will work at least eight hours a day, sixdays a week.   Herut Lapid, director of the United Kibbutz Movement anddirector of prisons and rehabilitation, assured state officials ina letter that a rehabilitation plan has been worked out for Shapiro.   Florida has no way of ensuring Shapiro will finish his sentenceat the kibbutz once in Israel, but the promise of a job and dozensof letters from well-respected sponsors make Martinez and theCabinet believe he will honor the agreement.   ``We would hope that a nation such as Israel would live up towhatever agreement ... that we use here to engage in clemency,''said Martinez.</TEXT></DOC>
