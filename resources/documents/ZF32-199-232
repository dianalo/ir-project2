(Hardware - Market Analysis)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Brownstein, Mark.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Nearly all streaming tape drives use Stac Electronics Inc's datacompression algorithm called QIC-122.andP;  All drives adhering to theprotocol have the same compression ratios for the same set offiles being backed up.andP;  Compression ratios vary only according todifferent files.andP;  Vendors claiming to have products that compressbetter than others do so incorrectly.andP;  Drives that feature acompression chip may give better data compression results andfaster speeds, but they adhere to the same algorithm.andP;  Backupsoftware products adhering to the algorithm differ in performanceas a result of floppy disk drive slowness and options that thesoftware products may have.andP;  Streaming tape drives can gaincompression ratios up to six to one, but ratios of two to one arenormal.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Stac Electronics Inc.
