Bruce Garnett, who conducted one of theinvestigations. He recently retired as the Patriot project manager at theArmy's Missile Command in Huntsville, Ala.;    The 11th Air Defense ArtilleryBrigade at Fort Bliss, Texas, which operated all 20 Patriot batteries in SaudiArabia, prepared a separate report that reached the same conclusions, anofficer familiar with the inquiry said.;    Army experts said in interviewsthat they knew within days that the Scud was intact when it hit and that atechnical flaw in the radar system was probably to blame.;    The problem wasidentified and corrected in all the Patriot batteries within weeks of theattack, officials said.;    The Army investigations raise questions as to whythe Pentagon and Central Command perpetuated the explanation that the Scudbroke up.;    Central Command officials denied that they were aware of theArmy's initial findings of computer malfunction. &quot;It was not something we hadat all,&quot; said Lt. Col. Michael Gallagher, who was a Central Command spokesmanin Riyadh.;    During the war, U.S. military officers were reluctant todiscuss any weapon failings. But even after the cease-fire, many officers wereaverse to saying anything that might tarnish the one-sided allied victory.;   The senior Army official familiar with the investigations said the servicewould not comment on the inquiries until top-level service officials hadreviewed the conclusions.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910520  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  389  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday May 20, 199100141114,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
