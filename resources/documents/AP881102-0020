The Environmental Protection Agency said the accord signedTuesday in Sofia, Bulgaria, by agency administrator Lee M. Thomasmeans ``no additional regulatory actions are required'' by theUnited States against oxides of nitrogen.   These combustion products become acid rain in the atmosphere andhelp form urban smog. One of them is responsible for the color ofthe ``brown cloud'' that hangs over smoggy cities such as LosAngeles.   Lawsuits were filed Tuesday in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia seeking to force the EPA to requirestates to revise their air pollution control plans to eliminatedamage to Canada.   This is the same question that the plaintiffs, the Canadianprovince of Ontario, the Izaak Walton League and the Sierra ClubLegal Defense Foundation, lost in a previous court round.   Though the EPA under the Carter Administration had declared thatacid rain originating in the United States was harming Canada, thecourt ruled that such a declaration was not enough to force thestates to act. Formal EPA regulations are required, the court said.   The EPA has argued that not enough is known about acid rain todraw up a control program.   ``We cannot afford to hold our breath waiting for the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency to wake up and smell the sulfur,''Ontario environment minister Jim Bradley told the provinciallegislature in announcing the new lawsuit.   The major component of acid rain in the eastern United States andCanada is sulfuric acid formed from sulfur dioxide emitted byutility and factory boilers.   The New York state attorney general's office said it waspreparing a renewal of a related suit on behalf of New York, NewJersey, Minnesota and the six New England states.   In Bulgaria, the United States joined a nitrogen oxides annex tothe United Nations-sponsored treaty on Long-Range Transboundary AirPollution.   In negotiation, the United States sought a 20 percent creditagainst emissions limits to compensate for reductions in U.S.emissions that had not yet been matched by European countries.   In a compromise, the negotiators chose a ``pick your limit''requirement. Emissions in any year through 1987, the particular yearchosen by each signing country, will be the limit in the 1990s. Inaddition, the annual average for the period 1987-1996 may not exceed1987 emissions.   For the United States, this amounts to about a 5 percent credit.Nitrogen oxides peaked in 1978 at 22.4 million tons and are nowabout 20.3 million tons. Forty-four percent comes fromtransportation, mostly motor vehicles, and a little under half fromboilers.   Though new cars emit only a quarter of the nitrogen oxides thatthey did in the 1960s, travel has grown so much that total emissionsare declining only slowly, and EPA expects the total to turn upagain in about 1995, reaching 20.2 million tons in 2000.   The United States refused to sign an earlier sulfur dioxideagreement pledging 30 percent emissions reductions. It said thatwould be unfair since U.S. emissions have fallen by a much largeramount than those in European countries.</TEXT></DOC>
