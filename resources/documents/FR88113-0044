Information in accordance with 40 CFR Part166 was submitted as part of this request. The Applicant has requested a maximum of one postemergence applicationof Harmony. Applications will be made between the two-leaf and boot stageof wheat and barley when wild garlic is 6 to 12 inches high. A maximumof 0.67 ounce of product is proposed to be applied per acre in North Carolina.A maximum of 100,000 acres of wheat and barley is proposed to be treatedin North Carolina. If all of the acreage were treated, a maximum of 4,188pounds of product would be needed in North Carolina. Applications are proposed to be made using ground equipment only. All applicationsare proposed to be made by or under the direct supervision of certifiedapplicators. North Carolina has requested authorization to make treatmentsthrough April 10, 1988. The Applicant claims that emergency conditions exist due to the presenceof wild garlic bulblets in harvested wheat and barley. Grain sold withgarlic bulblets present is generally docked on a per-bulblet basis. TheApplicant claims that the new regulations under the U.S. Grain StandardsAct which lower by two-thirds the amounts of wild garlic allowable in marketedwheat and barley have contributed to the need for a better means of controllinggarlic. If these new standards cannot be met, prices will be docked severelyor the grain may be refused altogether. In either event, the economic consequencescould be substantial if growers are unable to control wild garlic in wheatand barley. The Applicant claims that the registered alternatives currently availabledo not provide a sufficient level of control of wild garlic. The Applicantclaims that wheat and barley growers have traditionally used 2,4-D anddicamba to control this weed. Specifically, the Applicant claims that thesepesticides only provide 20 to 75 percent control of wild garlic. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself.It is the Agency's policy to solicit public comment on applications involvingunregistered active ingredients. Accordingly, interested persons may submitwritten views on this subject to the Program Management and Support Divisionat the address above.
