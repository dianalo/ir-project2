The green marketing movement has already spawned a bevy ofconsulting boutiques, newsletters, books, conferences, videoproducers and even specialized polling firms. They tell majorcompanies how to tap the rising environmental fervor and gaina marketing edge without running afoul of wary governmentregulators. But critics say the advice can often be shallow,leaving consumers as confused as ever about products'environmental claims.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's the biggest growth area in the world,&quot; exults PaddyCarson, vice president for environmental affairs at LoblawCos., Canada's largest food distributor. &quot;Green is Gold,&quot; hisenvironmental marketing handbook, hits stores in March.   In an industry scrambling for new sources of revenue,green truly is gold. Next Tuesday's &quot;Green Marketing Summit,&quot;organized by Advertising Age magazine, already has sold all400 tickets at $295 apiece. The summit comes just two weeksafter a similar two-day seminar, which cost 80 participants$895 each. Another half-dozen green marketing conferenceswill come later this year.   Saatchi andamp; Saatchi recently set up a world-wide &quot;GreenTeam&quot; to help clients track environmentally savvy consumers.Ogilvy andamp; Mather is trying to put together a Green IssuesCouncil. Midsized GSDandamp;M, based in Austin, Texas, claims to bethe only ad agency with a vice president for environmentalaffairs. Hill andamp; Knowlton and Burson Marsteller,public-relations firms owned by advertising giants WPP Groupand Young andamp; Rubicam, have formed separate environmentalpractices. Among other things, Burson Marsteller will &quot;green&quot;a client's entire work force through training dubbed&quot;enculturation.&quot;   In addition, two ad agencies, Stephen Garey andamp; Associatesand Johans+Son, have sprung up in California committed solelyto environmentally sensitive goods and services. Mr. Gareyfounded his shop in November 1989 after 22 years in the adbusiness. Rejecting oil companies &quot;who waved a lot of money,&quot;he expected to lose money for two years. Instead, the SantaMonica agency has landed seven small clients and turnedprofitable after six months. &quot;I've never been busier in mylife,&quot; Mr. Garey says. &quot;I am as amazed as anybody.&quot;   Green marketing consultants command big bucks as well.Carl Frankel, publisher of Green MarketAlert, one of foursuch newsletters, has packaged his green consumer wisdom intolonger consulting studies. The first 300-page report last Mayfetched $1,795 a copy. His latest, profiles of 35corporations' green consumer efforts, costs $1,495. &quot;There'salways going to be a mixture of hype&quot; and good intentionsbehind such efforts, Mr. Frankel concedes. But mostconsultants &quot;riding the environmental marketing wave tend tohave a high degree of environmental consciousness,&quot; he says.   Not everyone is so impressed with the deluge of greenmarketing wizards. &quot;There's not much they could tell us thatwe couldn't find out on our own,&quot; says a Hallmark Cardsofficial. The big greeting-cards maker is trying to figurehow to put &quot;recycled paper&quot; labels on certain card boxeswithout violating new state laws limiting environmentalpitches.   Jackie Ottman, a former advertising new-businessconsultant who turned &quot;green&quot; in 1989, unsuccessfully hastried to sell her expertise to Bristol-Myers Squibb. She hassuggested, for example, that the pharmaceuticals giant stoppackaging its Ban deodorant in boxes marked &quot;Made FromRecycled Paper&quot; because &quot;you don't really need the carton.&quot;In fact, Ms. Ottman maintains, &quot;you have so many ludicrous{green} claims because companies are doing these thingswithout the advice of consultants.&quot;   Ms. Ottman's advice &quot;wasn't bought,&quot; a Bristol-Myersspokeswoman bristles. &quot;All leading {anti-perspirant} brandsship in a carton,&quot; she continues, and the company beat rivalswith its introduction of recycled paper ones last year.   Using green marketing advisers sometimes can backfire. Mr.Carson hired a Toronto environmental group as consultant tohelp develop a line of environmentally friendly products forLoblaw's supermarket chain. A brouhaha erupted. Otherenvironmentalists accused the group of &quot;getting into bed withbusiness&quot; and forced its executive director to quit, Mr.Carson recalls. &quot;You make mistakes. You get up and admit itand move on.&quot;   In other cases, green advice falls short or exposescompanies to criticism. Advertising executives with littleenvironmental know-how are telling businesses to &quot;justpresent your product as green,&quot; complains Sarah Johnston, anenvironmental policy assistant for New York's attorneygeneral. That &quot;is very different,&quot; she adds, from encouragingmanufacturers to review all of their products and dropenvironmentally unsafe ones.   Last month, two Burson Marsteller clients ran into troubleover their green advertising claims. New York City'sDepartment of Consumer Affairs charged that Tetra Pak andCombibloc, the nation's leading producers of drink boxes,made deceptive claims in ads about the boxes' ability to berecycled. &quot;Drink boxes are as easy to recycle as this page,&quot;the newspaper ad asserted. Activists contend the boxes, whichhave been banned in at least one state, are difficult torecycle. A settlement likely will be reached soon, agencyofficials say, and each concern may be fined $1,000 or more.   &quot;We weren't trying to mislead people,&quot; retorts EdwardKlein, Tetra Pak vice president for environmental affairs.&quot;We are sensitive to this issue&quot; of making environmentalclaims very specific. Nor does Mr. Klein fault BursonMarsteller. He says the P.R. firm &quot;had a very minimal role&quot;in overseeing the campaign, whose ads were designed byLintas, an Interpublic unit.   Other green marketing aces have inspired detergent makersto put &quot;no phosphate&quot; labels on their boxes -- even thoughthe label may baffle consumers because producers removedphosphates years ago. And at last week's &quot;Power of Green&quot;conference, one speaker handed out eight-inch-high spruceseedlings as sample promotional gimmicks for corporatecampaigns tied to the green movement. But there was a catch,omitted by the speaker: The blue spruces can't grow anywhereexcept California.   ---   Chiat Wins Toshiba                                                                                                          Toshiba Corp. is expected to name Chiat/Day/Mojo to handlethe $15 million ad account for its computer systems division,industry executives said.
