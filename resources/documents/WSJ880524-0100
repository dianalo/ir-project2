That is, the deliverance of Cuba to the Soviet sphere of influence during the Kennedy administration by failing to provide U.S. air support for the invading forces at the Bay of Pigs, and the consequent Central American tragedies that have happened since because of this ignominious defeat.    Given swift and sure victory then and there, there would have been no &quot;Cuban Missile Crisis,&quot; the Monroe Doctrine as policy would still exist, the billions of dollars in military aid sent to Cuba by Soviet Russia for further delivery to Central American Soviet supporters would not have been delivered, and the hemisphere would be quite a different place without the current Soviet menace.    What Mr. Schlesinger calls &quot;the sheer technical incompetence&quot; of the Reagan administration is just plain peanuts compared with the deplorably incompetent decision making and blunders that happened in earlier days and at a time when the writer and finger-pointer himself was a part of the process.
