They're members of the MERIT Music Program, designed to developthe talents of children from poor neighborhoods who have no otheraccess to music.   Given the chance, they're as receptive as youths whose parentscan afford private music lessons, said Lisa Richter, who runs anopera workshop for the private, non-profit program.   ``The goal of this program is to provide the opportunity forthese underprivileged students to flourish,'' she said in atelephone interview Saturday.   Teachers with extensive music backgrounds, many of themprofessional musicians, provide ``as sophisticated musicinstruction as you'll find anywhere in the country,'' she said.   ``There is no other music school in the country (like MERIT) interms of making our services available to those who cannot pay,''Ms. Richter added.   But the students are required to have one year of prior musicinstruction and must audition to get into the program, she said.   The centerpiece of the program is its tuition-free Saturdayclasses for elementary and high school students in the red-brickDearborn Station.   Inside the old train station, about 200 students get individualand group instruction in classes ranging from beginning piano toadvanced musical theory.   MERIT, which employs about 33 part-time teachers, also sponsorsweekly and bi-weekly music classes in 10 Chicago public schools _most of them in poor neighborhoods _ reaching 500 to 600 children,Ms. Richter said.   Those classes act as ``feeder programs,'' preparing students whowant to participate in the Saturday classes, she said.   Once a year, for the past three years, youths in the advancedmusic theory class have staged an opera composed and performed bystudents.   This year's work, a 45-minute, one-act opera called ``TheLedge,'' is about a disillusioned young violinist who contemplatessuicide while facing his best friend's popularity as a rock star.   The opera, to be performed Sunday in MERIT's recital hall,features an eclectic combination of music, ranging from classicalopera to jazz complete with synthesizer, drums and electric bassguitar.   ``I've never really been exposed to opera,'' said Thomas White,17, who plays bass guitar in the opera's orchestra.   ``What surprised me the most is this was totally put together byus. It was done totally by the students. ... I think it's good,''said White, a senior at De La Salle High School, a nearly all-blackschool in an impoverished neighborhood.   White, who wants to teach music and perform professionally, hasattended MERIT's Saturday classes for 2{ years.   ``They expose you to a lot of different sounds _ classical, jazz_ a lot of different talents they help you to nurture. Someone frommy school ... they wouldn't normally be exposed to that kind ofstuff,'' he said.   MERIT students have earned scholarships to prestigious musicprograms like the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., andthe Interlochen music camp in Michigan.   The MERIT program was started in 1979 by a professional pianistand an amateur musician, Ms. Richter said. It is entirely funded bygrants, mostly from corporations and foundations.   Teachers who could be making $100 an hour elsewhere earn about$20 to $30 an hour, and all have outside jobs, said Ms. Richter,31, a former Roosevelt University music-theory instructor who worksfull time at a South Side bank.   ``I do it simply because it is rewarding,'' Ms. Richter said.``It gives me the opportunity to participate in these youngpeople's discovery of their own ability. It's extremely rewarding.''</TEXT></DOC>
