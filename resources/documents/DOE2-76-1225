<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-1225 </DOCNO><TEXT>Superconductive magnet energy storage system(SMES) was conceptually designedfocussing on its construction in 2000 and later from the viewpoint ofa technical development. For the design, required storage capacity of5GWh and maximum output of 1GW were decided by referring NEDO's or EPRI'sprofitability evaluation, and both solenoid type and toroidal type systemwere designed. As for the solenoid type system, the data of a coil configuration,wire materials, magnetic field and a coil structure were shown, and acancel coil method and magnetic shield method to prevent flux leakagewere presented. As for the toroidal type system, the data of a coil configuration,wire materials, a current density and applied current of the toroidalcoil, and a coil structure were shown. As a comparative evaluation resultof both systems, the toroidal type system was more suitable for practicalapplications with a superior workability and no flux leakage, however,the reduction of a construction cost was pointed out as the most importantproblem in the future.
