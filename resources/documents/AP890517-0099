Cities employed 2,541,000 people as of October 1987, the Bureausaid. That's 47,000 more than a year earlier and just 20,000workers short of the all-time high in October 1980.   The increase in 1987 _ the most recent figure available _reflects hiring to provide services to growing city populations,said Alan V. Stevens, head of the governments division of thebureau's employment statistics branch.   After peaking in 1980, city employment dropped sharply early inthis decade after cancellation of the Comprehensive EmploymentTraining Act, which provided federal money for governments to hireand train workers. A weak economy at that time also held downmunicipal hiring, Stevens said.   More recently, he said, cities have responded to improvingeconomic conditions and the needs of the times by increasing theirworkforces.   For example, while overall municipal employees were up 1.9percent between 1986 and 1987, city-employed corrections officersincreaseed 7.3 percent to 27,295.   Corrections, Stevens noted, is a fast-rising job category forstates, counties and other governments also, with the spreadingdrug problem and an increasing emphasis on jailing criminals.   Judicial and legal employees of cities also increased sharply,rising 11.9 percent to 38,609.   The number of city-employed police officers, however, was uponly 1.7 percent to 312,123, the report showed.   Overall, city governments had 148.2 workers per 10,000 residentsas of October 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
