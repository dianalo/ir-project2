disks; in itspresent incarnation it is designed specifically for use with its parentTandem Computers Inc's systems; the Iceberg will store 30Gb and 100Gb on5.25&quot; Winchesters bought in OEM from Hewlett-Packard Co.andM;- o -andM;Apple Computer Inc has bought rights to the design of the Outbound SystemsInc Wallaby Macintosh-compatible laptop computer, Electronic News believes:the paper reckons that Apple paid $3m for the technology and licensed it backto Outbound, and that it will build its own variants of the 68000-basedmachine to strengthen its position in the laptop market, where its own 16 lbsmodel has not prospered.andM;- o -andM;A well-placed consultant in Silicon Valley claims he is starting to see apattern forming among small unannounced Unix software start-ups: the Japanesemoney funding them - but then almost all high-tech venture capital funding inthe US seems to be coming from Japan these days.andM;- o -andM;Sounds a bit like vanity publishing where you pay to get your slim volumeprinted and distributed: Unisys Corp is having to pay developers of leadingbusiness applications to convert them to run on its Unix machines, ComputerSystems News reports: the paper says that it has signed agreements withCincom Systems Inc for its Control manufacturing package, and AccessTechnology Inc for its 20/20 spreadsheet, adding that similar deals arecooking.andM;- o -andM;It is the PS/55Z Japanese model of the PS/2 that Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co will be making - for IBM Japan, in Taiwan (CI No 1,486).andM;- o -andM;Samsung Electronics Co says it has perfected the design of a 16M-bit dynamicRAM and plans to put it into production in the second half of next year: theSeoul, South Korea company is currently making 7.5m to 8m 1Ms and 300,000 to500,000 4Ms a month, and looks to be doing 1m a month of the latter by theend of the year; it forecasts chip sales of $1,450m this year, $2,000m next.andM;- o -andM;Neuron Data Inc, based in Palo Alto, California and Tandem Computers Inc havesigned a product development agreement under which Neuron Data will developand market two products: a run-time version of Neuron's Nexpert Object expertsystem tool for Tandem's fault-tolerant NonStop systems, as well as a bridgefrom Nexpert to Tandem's proprietary NonStop SQL database.andM;- o -andM;London EC1-based Total Systems Plc reported a pre-tax loss of #6,722 - theEvening Standard said it was #6.7m, which sounds a bit excessive - for thefull year on turnover down 15% to #1.8m: the statement listed on the StockExchange said that the loss had been incurred by &quot;the unilateral cancellationof a contract by a new client towards the end of our financial year&quot;;however, Total Systems, which came to the market in March 1988 (CI No 896),was unable to provide the press with any further information.andM;- o -andM;As the world wonders whether Saddam Hussein means it when he says of hisintentions &quot;Just Kuwait!&quot; or whether he is simply using the intrusive ArabicK, the very ill wind blowing from the Gulf will not be entirely unwelcome tocompanies like Siemens AG, IBM Corp and Densitron International Ltd, all withgiant orders for personal computers from the Soviet Union and wondering wherethe hard currency to pay for them will be found: the USSR is the world'sbiggest producer of oil, and the windfall price increase will give Moscow awelcome increase in hard currency earnings - but what's good for the Sovietsis a disaster for the likes of Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, which fromJanuary 1 will have to start paying world market prices in hard currency forSoviet oil.andM;- o -andM;Amherst, Massachusetts-based Top Level Inc's parallel Common Lisp compiler isnow available on Data General's AViiON workstations: it's $4,500 on atwo-processor AViiOn.andM;- o -andM;The long-awaited orders from British Telecommunications Plc have finally comethrough for STC Plc: worth #33m they include orders for TXE exchangeextensions, higher order multiplexers, optical line systems and integratedservices digital network kit; if they'd only shown up months ago STC'sfigures might not have been so bleak.andM;- o -andM;London N1-based Touchstone Computers Ltd has bought the core business of RamComputer Group for an undisclosed sum: both companies are Omicron and Sundealers selling into the financial systems market.andM;- o -andM;Two regrettable American practices come together in DEC's message toemployees, quoted in the Financial Times - a phobia of straight talking thatleads to euphemisms having to be invented for euphemisms, and a penchant fortreating English as if it were simply German with different words(&quot;hopefully&quot; for &quot;it is to be hoped&quot; is perfectly good German but is no kindof English at all): so it is that DEC finds itself telling employees that itneeds to &quot;rightsize&quot; the company - it'll be boasting of practisingcorperaterightsizingation next - when it's trying to say that it has too manypeople and that some of them will have to lose their jobs.andM;- o -andM;Pixar Inc, which wasn't in Richmond, California, last time we looked butappears to be now, has announced the excruciatingly named Dingbat Looks,describing it as the first in a series of surface appearance libraries foruse with the company's three-dimensional RenderMan picture-making software onthe Apple Computer Inc Macintosh family: the software is designed to giveusers the ability to apply a variety of photorealistic visual appearances tosurfaces in a picture, such as making a colour slide with the text engravedonto a granite monument for a presentation, or give a dress design thesurface appearance of of denim or khaki; Dingbat Looks will ship in Novemberat $300; Pixar also announced the related Showplace picture compositionsoftware and ClipObjects series of three-dimensional clip object librariesbut gave no prices.andM;- o -andM;Informix Software Inc has licensed Du Pont Co to market its databasemanagement software products with its MacBlitz co-computer to provide AppleComputer Inc Macintosh users with a Unix-based information management system:McBlitz uses an unidentified RISC to supercharge the Mac behind the machine'sgraphical user interface and Informix thinks that Mac users will particularlywelcome access to the Informix-OnLine multimedia database engine; ships startbefore the end of the year; no other details given.andM;- o -andM;3Com Corp cut the price of its CS/1 communications server and EtherLink/MCadaptor board for IBM PS/2 Micro Channel computers - but then all MicroChannel add-ons are vastly over-priced compared with their AT-bus or EISAcounterparts: the CS/1 has been reduced by as much as 30% and theEtherLink/MC by between 14% and 16% - and features improved performance byuse of a faster version of the Intel 82586; the CS/1 chassis now costs $4,500and the 16-port asynchronous input-output board for the CS/1 is reduced to$1,500, the 8-port version is now $1,300; the EtherLink/MC adaptor is now$425, the five-pack $1,875.andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;T Co's Unix System Laboratories is adding some &quot;building blocks&quot; to C++later this month in the form of a library extension which it says will easethe building of applications: it will be offered in source code form forATandamp;T's 3B2 minicomputers with Unix V.3 up at $5,000 and $2,500 for eachadditional CPU.andM;- o -andM;General Motors Corp's Mountain View, California-based Hughes LAN Systems haslaunched a ProBridge family of high performance local area network bridgesfor Ethernet, Token Ring and broadband bridging with SNMP network management:the family includes the ProBridge 8033 Ethernet to Ethernet bridge, 8133Remote Ethernet Bridge, 8032 Broadband to Ethernet Bridge, 8233 Ethernet toBroadband Backbone Bridge and 8235 Token Ring to Broadband Backbone Bridge,replacing Hughes' LocalNet 8000 series of bridges; built around the 80386microprocessor, the ProBridge family offers Simple Network ManagementProtocol management as standard and can be custom-configured by the user tofilter any protocol or address, with the most common protocols pre-defined;the 8033 is $3,000; the 8133 is $4,000; the 8032 is $8,200, the 8233 and 8235are $10,000 each.andM;- o -andM;The UK's Lynwood Scientific Ltd, Alton, Hampshire has signed up forQuadratron Systems' Q-Office software, which it will sell on its own Open 30Unix workstations, and on Sun and Data General servers.andM;- o -andM;Hewlett-Packard Co has introduced the HP 7550 Plus graphics pen plotter, andannounced that as from the begining of September, it will ship LaserTools'PrintCache software with the HP 7475A and HP ColorPro: the HP 7550 Plusplotter replaces the HP 7550A plotter and Hewlett Packard says it has madeseveral enhancements including faster plotting, optional memory upgrades, andbackward compatibility; drawings plot up to 20% faster due to a newprocessor, algorithms and the HP-GL/2 graphics language, users can store plotfiles in memory, replot files on demand, and regain use of their computerswhile plotting, and the plotter's HP-GL language assures compatibility withthe HP 7550A plotter;
