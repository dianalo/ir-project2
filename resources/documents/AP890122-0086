The National Movement of Mothers and Relatives of PoliticalPrisoners marked the second anniversary of its founding by holding ameeting in the capital, where leaders charged the Sandinistagovernment was denying family visits to political prisoners.   ``The prisoners are being mistreated in jail and (the government)has denied them family visits for refusing to work,'' said MatildeGutierrez, the group's president. She did not elaborate.   She called for ``a total amnesty in the country'' for politicalprisoners.   Ms. Gutierrez told The Associated Press that 19 politicalprisoners have been on a hunger strike since Jan. 15 in the NationalPenitentiary System facility to protest the government's refusal topermit visits.   The facility, which houses former National Guardsmen who foughtunder the late dictator Anastasio Somoza, is located about 14 milesnortheast of Managua.   The Sandinistas toppled Somoza in the 1979 guerrilla war. Some ofthe former guardsmen are serving prison terms of up to 30 years.   An official with the Interior Ministry, which operates theprison, denied that prisoners were fasting.   ``There is no hunger strike among the prisoners,'' the officialsaid on condition of anonymity. He acknowledged that ``they refuseto work, which is a disadvantage for them.'' The official declinedto elaborate.   ``Normally, all of the prisoners who were closely linked with theSomoza system don't work, they maintain a constant protest and arein complete disagreement with the penitentiary system,'' theofficial said.   President Daniel Ortega said in December that there were 3,142political prisoners, including former guardsmen and anti-Sandinistarebels, in Nicaraguan jails.   Ms. Gutierrez on Sunday disputed that figure.   ``Throughout the country, there are more than 20,000 politicalprisoners, and this affects in all some 30,000 children,'' she said.   Ortega also said the government had released more than 1,300prisoners in compliance with the Central American peace plan signedby Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras in1987.   Also Sunday, Costa Rican security authorities said Sandinistatroops shot and killed a young Nicaraguan trying to cross into CostaRica.   Luis Antonio Lopez Lopez, 17, died Friday night while trying toget across the San Juan River in a tiny boat with 16 other youngNicaraguans, said Carlos Jimenez, spokesman for the Costa RicanPublic Security Ministry.   Costa Rican civil guardsmen reported that the Sandinista troopsopened fire from a hilltop, he said in a telephone interview.   A Nicaraguan Defense Ministry official on Sunday disputed thereport and said Nicaraguan troops exchanged gunfire withanti-Sandinista guerrillas along the border.   Costa Rica is home to more than 40,000 Nicaraguan refugees whohave fled the economic crisis and civil war in their homeland.</TEXT></DOC>
