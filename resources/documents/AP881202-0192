DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan and Soviet President MikhailGorbachev are meeting Wednesday for the fifth time, at a luncheon inNew York.   They will be joined at the table by President-elect George Bush.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the session ``willensure that the momentum and continuity of the arms control talksare extended and it will reaffirm the relations between the generalsecretary and the new president of the United States as we enter thedecade of the '90s.''   Officials said subjects would include the suspended Soviet troopwithdrawal from Afghanistan, with the United States seekingassurances that the troops will be out on schedule. They said theagenda for arms control and human rights talks would also be raised.   Here, in brief, is a look at the previous Reagan-Gorbachevsummits.</TEXT><HEAD>GENEVA, 1985</HEAD><TEXT>   The two leaders met on Nov. 19 and 21, exchanging enthusiastichandshakes and champagne toasts before getting down to business.   When the meeting was over, they had agreed to hold summits in1986 in Washington and 1987 in Moscow and to give impetus to armscontrol talks, aiming at 50 percent reductions in nuclear weapons.   Reagan said in advance of the meeting that he would pressGorbachev on human rights and regional conflicts, but documentsafter the summit and statements by the leaders indicated little signof movement.   Agreements were reached on cultural exchanges, air safety,additional consulates, increased air travel and cooperation onenergy.   Both sides said they favored a complete prohibition of chemicalweapons as well as destruction of existing stockpiles, a goal thatstill has not been reached although an international conference isforthcoming.   The two sides failed to reach any agreement on Reagan's Star Warsplan of space-based missile defense, on extension of the Salt IItreaty, on divided families or on a joint venture in space.</TEXT><HEAD>REYKJAVIK, 1986</HEAD><TEXT>   Moscow broke off pre-summit talks after the U.S. bombing of Libyain April, 1986, dooming any chance of a summit in Washington thatyear, but the Soviets and the White House announced Sept. 30 thatReagan and Gorbachev would meet Oct. 11 and 12 in the Icelandiccapital.   Reagan told reporters, ``This is not a summit,'' saying it wasdesigned only to pave the way for summit meetings in Washington andMoscow. Spokesman Larry Speakes said, ``We will be satisfied withthe Iceland meetings if we accomplish better understanding.''   The meetings ended in misunderstanding, with U.S. officialsproclaiming themselves ``deeply disappointed'' because potentialarms agreements vanished when the two leaders reached an impasse ontesting of Star Wars weaponry. The administration later sought topaint the outcome in brighter hues, with Reagan saying it left thesuperpowers ``closer than ever'' to an unprecedented cut in nucleararsenals.   Four months after the summit, the Democratic-controlled HouseArmed Services Committee said in a report that there remained ``anastonishing degrees of confusion surrounding what actuallyhappened'' at Reykjavik. The report said sweeping U.S. proposals fordeep reductions in nuclear arms were presented without advance studyby the Pentagon.   Disagreement remains over the events of Reykjavik. On Nov. 15,the day plans were announced for the latest Reagan-Bush-Gorbachevmeeting, the president was asked how the United States would reactif Gorbachev brought proposals, as he did in Iceland. Said Reagan,``Well, it depends on whether you're going by the public version ofReykjavik or what actually happened there.'' He did not elaborate.</TEXT><HEAD>WASHINGTON, 1987</HEAD><TEXT>   In meetings Dec. 8-10 at the White House, the two leaders signedan agreement to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles, thefirst treaty ever to eliminate an entire category of nuclear arms.   They said they made progress but reached no agreement to curblong-range strategic weapons and struck no deal on Soviet withdrawalfrom Afghanistan, still a trouble spot in 1988 despite aU.N.-mediated agreement by the Soviets to withdraw all troops byFeb. 15.</TEXT><HEAD>MOSCOW, 1988</HEAD><TEXT>   Reagan arrived in the Soviet capital May 29 for a four-day staythat would be long on pageantry and symbolism but offer a mixedrecord of accomplishment.   A joint communique said the leaders reached ``common ground'' onverifying the numbers of mobile missiles and cruise missiles carriedby airplanes, important elements if a strategic arms treaty is to bereached.   But the sides were still divided on the U.S. Star Wars program aswell as on submarine-fired missiles and reductions in conventionalforces.   On human rights, Gorbachev said he told Reagan that ``yourexplanations are not convincing ... I am not filled with admirationat this aspect of the visit.'' Reagan has applauded recent humanrights developments in the Soviet Union, including new freedom fordissidents such as Andrei Sakharov, while insisting that more needsto be done.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 4</NOTE></DOC>
