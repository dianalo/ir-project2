HELIER, Jersey (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The tiny Channel islands of Jersey andGuernsey have become prospering offshore financial centers but somenatives are concerned their idyllic way of life may be lost in toomuch wealth.   ``The fear in all our minds is that we will become another MonteCarlo,'' says Anne Perchard, a Jersey dairy farmer.   With booming financial services industries and low taxesattracting both job-seekers and the wealthy, the islands haveintroduced rules to drastically cut immigration.   Jersey now allows just five new millionaires to take residencein the tax haven each year, down from 15, and it has what it claimsare the world's only price controls on homes.   The islands' growing number of high-quality financialinstitutions provide a place for individuals and companies tolegally shelter their money from their own countries' taxes and tomake more money on high-yielding investments.   Income and corporate tax rates are 20 percent, and there are nosales, inheritance or capital gains taxes.   Attractions are the English language, political stability, theBritish time zone, proximity to the Continent and freedom fromEuropean Economic Community regulations.   But the islands generally follow British financial regulations,and an absence of bank secrecy acts has helped them avoid theunsavory reputations of other tax havens.   The result has been a job-creating economic boom that hasbrought the big benefits of full employment and government budgetsurpluses. But the downside has been immigration pressures,high-rise buildings, traffic jams and strained water supplies.   Natives who aren't sure they like this transformation clash withthe newcomers who want credit for improving the islands' livingstandards.   ``Jersey has to manage the success so you actually don't killthe golden goose,'' said Jerseyman Martin Dryden, who is managingdirector of Gartmore Fund Managers International Ltd.   Jersey, which has an area of 39 square miles, has seen itspopulation swell to 82,000 from 60,000 in 1961. The population of25-square-mile Guernsey has jumped to 60,000 from 54,000 in 1976.   Many residents have one car and some have two, which works outto about 100,000 automobiles on the islands.   There are hopes _ and fears _ of more prosperity.   The islands, which are dependencies of the British crown but notmembers of the European Economic Community, are positioned to turninto ``offshore Europe'' from ``offshore Britain'' when the12-nation community becomes a single market in 1992.   ``We see it as being a position of opportunity,'' says ColinPowell, Jersey's leading civil servant.   The Channel Islands, which also include the smaller, still ruralAlderney, Herm and Sark, are in the English Channel about 20 milesoff Normandy in France.   Once part of the Duchy of Normandy, the islands retained theirallegiance to the king of England when Normandy was freed ofEnglish rule in 1204.   Although some patois and other French influences survive, mostpeople speak English. Gray, stone cottages have names such asHillsea View and gardening is taken seriously.   Bailiffs appointed by Queen Elizabeth II preside over locallyelected legislatures. There are no political parties.   During World War II, the Channel Islands were the only Britishsoil occupied by the Nazis _ for five long years.   The islands' financial services industries began in the 1960sand today, with hundreds of banks and insurance companies and morethan 1,000 investment funds, they dominate the islands' economies.   Jersey says its finance sector overtook tourism in 1986 andaccounted for 40 percent of gross national product in 1987,compared with 20 percent in 1975.   The island's GNP doubled from 1962 to 1987, while Guernsey's hasgrown an average 8.5 percent a year in the past three years.   To stem the population growth, Jersey now requires companies toobtain permission to increase staff and new companies need licenses.   ``We are selective,'' Powell says. ``We would like to seecontinued profit growth of the institutions without people growth.''   Only people born on Jersey and their children are allowed to buyand lease property. In Guernsey, 90 percent of the housing marketis reserved for locals.   In Jersey, key professional workers can rent a home of their ownonly after living in employer-provided accommodation for 10 years.But that right expires next year. A right to buy a home afterliving on the island for 20 years expires in the year 2000.   Each year's five new millionaires have had to convince a housingcommittee that they ``are of social and economic value to theislands,'' says committee chairman Hendric Vandervliet.   Seeking to protect young locals, the committee also reviews allhome sales and, if it thinks a price is too high, orders itlowered. Prices would be 40 percent higher without these controls,Vandervliet says.   Real estate agents and other opponents say the controlsdiscourage sellers and make it more difficult for islanders to gethomes.   ``All it's doing is closing the market up,'' says Sylvia Nixon,a 44-year-old Jersey taxi driver, who after a two-year searchmanaged to find a property in bad condition for the equivalent of$72,000.   On both islands, natives worry that agriculture will die out.   But Robert Lindell, general manager of Chase Manhattan Bank'sJersey operations, says he is getting tired of the locals'complaints.   ``It's the financial industry that allows them to have a verynice standard of living.''   Says Norman Le Cheminant, Guernsey's top civil servant, ``Mostpeople would agree that the problems of prosperity are better thannot having prosperity.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs Aug. 24</NOTE></DOC>
