Plants will have to cease operating whenever there is anabnormal radioactivity increase of 20% or more, the Ministryof International Trade and Industry said. Previously,operators had no percentage guidelines.</LP><TEXT>   On Feb. 9, at a plant in Mihama, in western Japan,radioactive water leaked from a broken tube in one of theplant's steam generators. After an abnormal increase of about20% in radioactivity was recorded by the plant's sensors,technicians began taking water samples to double-check thereadings. Before they had completed their work, however, anemergency core cooling system automatically took over,shutting down the plant.   The incident was the first time in Japan that such asystem was activated. Only a minor amount of radioactivityleaked into the atmosphere and there was no health risk ordamage to the environment, officials said.   Officials acknowledge the incident was one of the mostserious ever for Japan's nuclear industry. Currently, 40nuclear plants supply 28% of the nation's power needs.Officials estimate that by 1995, the figure will rise to 36%.   The subject of nuclear energy has been much debated inJapan, and the incident at the Mihama facility is expected tointensify opposition. Though the government is calling forincreased monitoring and more stringent inspections atnuclear facilities, MITI said it has no intention of slowingthe expansion of Japan's nuclear power generating capacity.</TEXT></DOC>
