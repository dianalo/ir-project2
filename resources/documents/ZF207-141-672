(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Kathleen O'MalleyandM;Secretary Linda Dale remembers when she only typed and took dictation, tossedthe day's problems in her boss's lap and walked out the door at 5 o'clock.andM;Gone now are the days of what Dale calls ''robot'' work, when a secretaryonly performed simple office functions that required little thought.andM;Since Dale and other secretaries in the insurance division of the MeekerSharkey Financial Group in Cranford, N.J., have become proficient PC users,they have access to such information as policy types and clients' health andbackground records -- previously available only to an agent.andM;Access to information via PCs has changed the nature of work for Dale andother office workers around the country; they have become decision makers.andO;At Meeker Sharkey, secretaries now are able to renew and upgrade policies,calculate benefits and address the problems of 200 clients -- work previouslydone by agents.andM;''I'm a single mother, so I'm a supermom at home, and now I'm a superwoman atwork,'' said Dale.andM;For example, when clients call in to borrow on their policy, it is up to asecretary to see how much cash is available, whether the clients have paidtheir premiums and how much can be borrowed on the policy.andP;  If everythingchecks out, the secretary can approve a loan without involving the agent.andM;While secretaries assume more administrative responsibilities, agents arespending between 25 percent and 50 percent more time selling and areincreasing sales at about the same rate, said Office Manager Donald Murray.andM;The company has renamed some secretaries ''administrative sales assistants''and recommended that agents offer them bonuses of 5 percent of the agent'stotal sales commissions after the first $5,000 in sales.andP;  Dale said she likesthe idea because ''It's like investing in my own business instead of workingfor someone else to get rich.''andM;Murray said that in some insurance companies, agents are making theirsecretaries into partners, splitting commissions with them and in some casesallowing them to make sales.andP;  One skeptical secretary at Meeker Sharkey said,''No one volunteers to dig into their own pocket,'' but added that she willwait and see how the plan works.andM;At the Richmond Savings Credit Union in Richmond, British Columbia, it wasthe PC that transformed utilities clerk Brenda Dixon into a creativeassistant to her supervisor, Douglas Bellamy.andP;  After working 12 years as autility clerk, Dixon found her skills were limited to adding utility bills ona calculator.andP;  But since she learned DOS, Lotus 1-2-3 and Quattro threemonths ago, she's sprinted from doing simple spreadsheets to developinggraphical reports for senior management.andM;Previously, each manager did his or her own calculations and came up withdifferent statistics comparing profitability, growth and return on assets andequity between Richmond Savings and other leading banks, said Robert Wilson,vice president of corporate planning and technology.andM;Dixon's supervisor asked her to find a way to present the information moreconsistently and clearly.andP;  She designed a graphic report illustrating thecomparisons, and the problem of conflicting statistics ended.andM;Because Dixon sits at an XT compatible all day, graphing the company's assetsor inputting data on loans and delinquency accounts, ''She's forced tounderstand the impact of the work and has to do some analysis,'' saidBellamy.andP;  She's been promoted to assistant technician and has seen her salaryincrease from $19,000 to $25,000, with a promise of an 8 percent raise in thenext year.andM;As for Dixon, who found her previous position ''mundane,'' for the first timein years she has a reason for coming to work in addition to a new careerpath.andP;  ''My whole life has turned around,'' she said.andP;  ''I feel like I'mdoing something that needs to be done and is important.''andM;Wilson welcomes the change.andP;  ''We're eliminating layers of management,'' hesaid, ''and replacing them with groups of specialists to report to one person-- the president.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
