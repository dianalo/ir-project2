For the second day in a row, the leading producer of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, conservative and generally shy of controversy, reaffirmed its commitment to OPEC allotments in the wake of persistent reports it is exceeding its production quota.    The Saudi government also &quot;categorically denied the reports which said the kingdom, by signing the arms deal agreement with Britain, had caused a reduction of oil prices,&quot; according to a Saudi Press Agency statement released in Riyadh and in Washington.    This official statement followed, by one day, a similar denial from Hisham M. Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, of any link between the Saudi-British weapons deal and the level of oil production in the kingdom. In his Wednesday statement, Mr. Nazer also said Saudi Arabia remains committed to its production quota; he urged other OPEC members to adhere to their fixed-production levels, and he called on non-OPEC producers to cooperate in retaining balance in the oil market by reducing their output.    As previously reported, Saudi Arabia will buy jet fighters and other military equipment from Britain, under a huge $12 billion trade agreement. It is understood that an exchange of oil for arms is involved, similar to a smaller 1985 Saudi-British trade agreement.    Except for its size, the latest agreement isn't much different from other barter deals common in OPEC. And Saudi Arabia hasn't always been able to produce as much as its quota despite the oil commitments to British oil companies under the prior agreement.    Nevertheless, some oil analysts foresee Saudi production rising as a result of this agreement and another one -- to supply oil under terms of a pending acquisition of a 50% interest in the Eastern U.S. refining and marketing assets of Texaco Inc. And OPEC production -- said to be paced by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates -- suddenly is surging despite a weak oil market.    Industry estimates place current OPEC output at 19 million to 20 million barrels a day. That's 500,000 to 1.5 million barrels a day above the second-quarter average and is believed to be the reason behind recent erosion of oil prices, down more than $3 a barrel this year. The overall quota for the OPEC members is 15.2 million barrels a day, but excludes Iraq, which has refused to join the effort.    Saudi Arabia's OPEC quota is 4.3 million barrels a day, but its output is estimated to have climbed to a level between 4.8 million and 5.2 million barrels a day in early July. &quot;I've confirmed with several sources that for the first 10 days of July it (Saudi production) is at least five million barrels a day,&quot; said Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of Petroleum Finance Co., a Washington-based consulting firm.    Some trackers of OPEC suggested that Saudi Arabia's production often reaches up early in a month, only to drop later to within its quota for the month. But Mr. Zanoyan noted that when prices were low in the past, the Saudis and other Arab producers generally cooperated with some restraint. &quot;This time,&quot; he said, &quot;Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are not in concert.&quot;    While Saudi Arabia &quot;hasn't gone too far over quota,&quot; said a source close to the Saudis, an OPEC battle for market share is evolving into a free-for-all. &quot;Everybody's going overboard, and I don't see any restraining force to stop the escalation,&quot; he said.    Some see the higher output in the Persian Gulf region as a strategic move by the Arab countries supporting Iraq in the war against Iran. &quot;The strategy is to flood the market with oil to push the price down and deprive Iran of (petroleum revenue) finances,&quot; said David Mizrahi, editor of the New York-based MidEast Report.    The Iranians think so, too. Wednesday, in some of their harshest terms yet, Iranian officials accused Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries of deliberately driving down the price of oil.    Middle East sources said the Iranian charges helped trigger yesterday's statement from the Saudis -- still sensitive over their alleged role in the 1986 oil-price collapse -- in which the kingdom again strongly defended itself against reports it is contributing to lower oil prices.    Despite Mr. Nazer's reiteration of &quot;the kingdom's keenness to adhere to the production quota set by OPEC,&quot; the Saudi statement said, &quot;certain quarters&quot; have been accusing it of being the cause of the reduction in oil prices. &quot;Such fabricated press campaigns against the kingdom might be masterminded by oil brokers and their agents,&quot; the statement added. </TEXT></DOC>
