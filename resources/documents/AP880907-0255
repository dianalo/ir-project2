Amoco Corp. Vice Chairman James Cozad, who sits on USG's board,noted that the ``acquisition and leveraged buyout business ... hasbeen a financial bonanza for investment banks. Obviously the desireor opportunity to make substantial profits puts a lot of pressureon ethics.''   Investment bankers bristle at the suggestion their moral fibermay be compromised.   ``Bankers have been hammered at for quite some time for beingfee chasers, but the critics lose sight of the fact that we are inthe client business, and our integrity and credibility are thethings we sell,'' said one investment banker, who asked not to beidentified because of the sensitivity of the issue. ``We'll have ashort life if we get a reputation of not honoring our commitments.''   Investment bankers also argue that a good portion of theinformation they get from a company is in the public domain anyway.   But in addition to crucial non-public information, talks withcompany executives provide bankers with a more subjective view of acompany _ their market position, their own assessments of theirbusiness strategy and personnel, their own valuation of assets.   ``There's nothing like speaking to a CEO and hearing what'sreally going on,'' said securities lawyer Paul Fischer. ``Ahalf-hour conversation can be very illuminating.''   As Amoco's Cozad can attest, ``In certain instances (investmentbanks) need a lot of private information, and that informationindeed would be of great benefit to somebody outside our company.''   Besides investment firms, commercial banks are surfacing morefrequently in Mandamp;A deals as they try to expand beyond theirtraditional yet decreasingly profitable role as lenders.   This new set of players has outraged some companies. IntercoInc., for example, assailed Chase Manhattan Bank in August foragreeing to help finance a hostile takeover bid.   Chase had served as Interco's primary international banker andhad participated with other banks in providing the company with a$150 million revolving credit agreement, among other services.While Interco did not file a lawsuit, a spokeswoman said thecompany feels ``abandoned'' by Chase and is in the process ofsevering its ties with the bank.   Banks and investment firms are not the only alleged culprits.Lawyers have also been accused of using confidential informationabout previous clients. Earlier this year, Murray OhioManufacturing Co. found itself the target of a hostile bid by ABElectrolux of Sweden. Advising Electrolux was the New York law firmSullivan andamp; Cromwell, the same firm that helped Murray Ohio fashionits anti-takeover strategy a year earlier.   John L. Duncan, Murray Ohio's president and chief executiveofficer, said in a court hearing that he learned about Sullivan andamp;Cromwell's involvement when he received a letter from Electrolux onthe law firm's stationery.   ``I was absolutely shocked. I couldn't believe that they wouldbe representing Electrolux,'' he said.   While a three-judge panel agreed Sullivan andamp; Cromwell had aconflict of interest, it ruled there had been no transfer ofconfidential information.   The conflict problem takes a new twist when advisers take equitypositions in companies and becoming investors themselves.   Koppers Co. spearheaded a public campaign against Shearsonearlier this year because the investment house was participating asan equity partner in a hostile bid with Britain's Beazer PLC.   Officials from Pennsylvania rallied round and terminated whatthey said amounted to a $7 billion business relationship withShearson. Ultimately the Pittsburgh-based company agreed to beacquired by Beazer for $1.8 billion.   Katarincic, who represented Koppers, called it a ``casebooksituation'' that already has had an impact.   ``I know a number of deals where people were thinking of takingan equity position in hostile tender offers who have backed away''in the wake of Koppers' confrontation, he said.   To avoid conflicts in mergers and acquisitions, securitieslawyer John Stoppelman suggests a ``code of professionalresponsibility or ethics'' similar to what governs lawyers. He saida code would establish benchmark standards to guide relationshipsand therefore serve as a stronger test for liability.   Congress is considering legislation, meanwhile, that wouldshorten the length of time investors have to disclose significantstakes in companies.   Several executives said the recent high-profile confrontationsmay be what is needed to send a warning signal to bankers.   ``I don't know if it will deter them, but I think all investmentbanking firms are becoming more sensitive to the issue'' ofconflicting interests, USG's Miller said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Sept. 11</NOTE></DOC>
