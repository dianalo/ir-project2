The applicationis entitled ``Kinetics of Sufation of Calcium Oxides''.<T3>Scope</T3>: The research activity addressed is this effort proposesto improve understanding of the role of limestones in reducing the emissionof sulfur and sulfur oxide from pulverized coal combustion. The resultswill assist in identifying characteristics and limestone properties thatare important and necessary for effective use as the sulfur capture additivein coal combustion.In the past there have been many limitations to the work which was carriedout on the reaction of SO<T2>2</T2> with lime. Most notable of these has been an inability to separatethe competing effects of intrinsic chemical reactivity of the stone fromdiffusive transport effects. The subject proposal attacks this issue directly,and is therefore considered unique. In addition, the proposal addressesthe transition of an initially amorphus product layer to a crystallizedform having a greatly reduced ionic diffusions coefficient. The use ofelectrodynamic balance for TGA studies of reacting particles is also ahighly unique feature of this work.The results of this effort should encourage that section of the publicwhich is involved in the use of coal to generate power without deleteriouslyimpacting the environment. The term of the grant will be for an 18 monthperiod at an estimated value of $100,000.00.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</T2>: U.S. Department of Energy, PittsburghEnergy Technology Center, Acquisition and Assistance Division, P.O.
