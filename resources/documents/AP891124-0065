The newspaper El Tiempo reported that the cartel leader, PabloEscobar, fled into the jungle wearing only his pants. Officials didnot confirm this.   El Tiempo said two of Escobar's bodyguards were killed and 55people were arrested in the raid, which took place early Thursday.   Hundreds of troops from government security forces blocked roadsthroughout the area, 70 miles west of Medellin, in an attempt tocatch Escobar, El Tiempo said, and helicopters patrolled the areato prevent him from fleeing by air.   Army troops and members of a special police anti-drug unit, nottold where they were going, headed out in helicopters and raidedthe ranch in central Colombia, El Tiempo and two other Bogotadailies, El Espectador and La Prensa, said.   El Tiempo, quoting officers commanding units of the troopsinvolved, said Escobar, who is wanted in the United States, raninto the jungle wearing only pants.   It quoted police as saying they are sure it was Escobar who fledbecause he left behind a shirt with documents in it belonging tohim.   National Police spokesman Octavio Vargas said today that it isbelieved Escobar and another Medellin member fled during the raid.He spoke during an interview with the Colombian radio networkCaracol.   La Prensa, quoting police sources, said Escobar and anothermember of the Medellin cartel were at a meeting at the ranch whenthe police moved in.   The office of President Virgilio Barco said in a communiquetoday the raid was on an operations center of the Medellin cartelbut it did not mention Escobar.
