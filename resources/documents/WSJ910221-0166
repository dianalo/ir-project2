The U.S. and Britain, staunchest of allies in battle, havediscovered they are also rivals for many reconstructioncontracts that will come once the peace is secured. Theallies' opening skirmish came yesterday over the first phaseof that massive job, a 90-day emergency program designed tomake Kuwait habitable by restoring such services as water andelectricity.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which won a $46 millioncontract from Kuwait to manage the emergency effort, providedonly 48 hours for companies to sign up for a piece of theaction. Britain's Department of Trade and Industry complainedthat the time period was &quot;absurdly short.&quot;   Still, with the deadline slated to expire last night, thedepartment rallied dozens of construction and engineeringcompanies into action. An official with the Corps ofEngineers in Damman, Saudi Arabia, said, &quot;The fax machineshave been jammed with prequalification applications&quot; fromcompanies wanting to position themselves for roles in thepost-war effort.   Neither the Kuwaiti government nor the U.S. Army is sayinghow much money will go into the emergency phase of thereconstruction work. Estimates are that the job will be about$500 million. &quot;This isn't the big glamorous stuff, but it hasto be done,&quot; said an official with the Corps of Engineers.   British officials, and others, are looking beyond the90-day patch-up work. The larger job of rebuilding Kuwait'soil facilities, power stations, roads, hospitals andapartments will add up to between $50 billion and $100billion, analysts estimate.   &quot;The U.S. won't be responsible for the whole rebuildingprocess,&quot; said British Industry Secretary Peter Lilley. &quot;TheKuwaitis have said they specifically welcome U.K. companies.&quot;   Britain, said one British diplomat in the Middle East,deserves a role &quot;commensurate with British involvement inliberating Kuwait.&quot; To avoid being edged out by Americancontenders, the U.K. is establishing a task force in Damman,adjacent to the Kuwaiti committee that will decide whorebuilds the country.   In a recent London radio interview, British companies wereassured by remarks of Kuwait's ambassador. &quot;We do thank thegovernment of the U.K. and the people of the U.K. for theirsupport,&quot; he said, &quot;and we are not going to forget ourfriends at all. . . . The companies which have done somethingin Kuwait will go back and do also something in rebuildingKuwait.&quot;   But given the breadth of the alliance fighting to pushSaddam Hussein out of Kuwait, there will probably be manyfriends insisting that Kuwait not forget them. For example,Egypt's Trade and Industry Minister has been lobbying for apromise that Egyptian companies will get their share of thereconstruction.</TEXT></DOC>
