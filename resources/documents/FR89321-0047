Dane at the addressgiven above, or telephone (703) 358-1708.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In its previous notice on this subject(53 FR 35530, September 14, 1988) the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)requested information on plant or animal species that might lead the Serviceto prepare amendment to listings under CITES for consideration at the nextregular meeting of the Conference of the Parties. That notice describedthe provisions of CITES for listing species in the appendices and set forthinformation requirements for proposals. The present notice responds tocomments and information received.The Peregrine Fund Inc. proposed transferring the peregrine falcon (<T3>Falco peregrinus</T3>) from Appendix I to Appendix II, and the NorthAmerican Falconers Association proposed removing the <T3>tundrius </T3>race of the peregrine falcon from Appendix I. However,two North American subspecies and a European subspecies (<T3>Falco peregrinus peregrinus</T3>) are still on the U.S. List of Endangeredand Treatened Wildlife. <T3>Falco peregrinus tundrius </T3>is listed as threatened. The Serviceacknowledges the efforts of The Peregrine Fund and falconers in restoringperegrine populations in the United States. Although the status of thesetaxa has improved in recent years, there are no imminent plans to changethe listing of these subspecies. For this reason and as well as concernfor the similiarity of appearance with other subspecies, the Service doesnot intend to submit an amendment on the peregrine falcon to the Secretariat.The Peregrine Fund and the North American Raptor Breeders Association proposedtransferring the gyrfalcon (<T3>Falco rusticolus</T3>) from Appendix I to Appendix II, and the NorthAmerican Falconers Association suggested that this species be removed fromAppendix I. At the fifth meeting of the Conference of the Parties the UnitedStates voted against transferring the North American population of thisspecies to Appendix I based on the population status information available.Nevertheless, the Parties adopte the amendment apparently in large partbecause of concern about illegal trade in specimens from this populationand some concern about similiarity of appearance to specimens from theEuropean populations which were listed on Appendix I. We have not soughtrecent information as to the status of these latter populations. However,we have consulted CITES officials in Canada, inasmuch as this country hasprimary interest in the protection as well as legitimate trade in thisspecies. Canadian authorities are planning to implement procedures to addressthe enforcement concerns especially through identification of specimensfrom Canada. However, they are concerned about submitting an amendmentuntil these procedures are fully implemented and can satisfy the otherParties. Consequently, Canadian authorities are not planning to submitan amendment on this species until the meeting of the Parties in 1991.Therefore, in deference to their position, we do not intend to submit anamendment on the gyrfalcon at this next Conference of the Parties.The following additional proposals were received and will be consideredfor possible submission as proposed amendments to CITES's Appendices. TheService seeks additional comments and information to assist it in decidingwhether to submit these amendments.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. African elephant (</ITAG><T3>Loxodonta africana</T3>)The Committee for Humane Legislation proposed transferring the Africanelephant from Appendix II to Appendix I. The Service recognizes the significantdecline in the African elephant populations and the threat posed by continuedpoaching and illegal trade in elephant tusks and ivory pieces. Where theseactivities can be clearly documented, bans on imports are being establishedunder the African Elephant Conservation Act. In the February 3, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 5553) information is sought as to theability of ivory-producing countries to control poaching and properly managetheir native elephant populations. Presently, the Service understands thatthere are 750,000 elephants and that there may be several viable elephantpopulations. Furthermore, the Service recognizes the potential economicbenefit to those countries that are able to properly manage their elephantpopulations. Consequently, the Service, if it submits an amendment, mayconsider an amendment that addresses certain countries or geographicalareas or an amendment that applies to all countries. Any information receivedin response to either the February 3, 1989. <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 5553) notice or the present notice willbe considered by the Service in deciding to submit an amendment on theelephant to the Secretariat for consideration at the meeting of the Partiesthis fall.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Flying Foxes (</ITAG><T3>Pteropus</T3> spp.)The Service has received a proposal to transfer all 14 taxa of flying foxescurrently listed in Apprndix II to Appendix I and to add the remaining48 species in the genus to Appendix II.Flying foxes have long been an important source of food to traditionalsubsistence communities of the Pacific archipelagos of Micronesia and Polynesiaand continue to be consumed in great quantities as a delicacy in more moderncommunities, especially on Guam. According to the proposal received, over12,000 flying foxes from Palau, Truk, Pohnpei, Western Samoa, and the Philippineswere imported to Guan in 1988, whereas over 50,000 were requested for import.Palau, Truk, and Pohnpei are currently the biggest suppliers.Available data on the status of flying fox species of western Pacific archipelagosindicate population declines due to commercial exploitation for food forthe following species: <T3>Pteropus mariannus</T3> ssp. in the Northern Mariana Islands; <T3>P.</T3> <T3>tonganus</T3> on American Samoa; <T3>P. samoensis</T3> on American and Western Samoa. Available data for<T3>P. insularis, P. molossinus </T3> and <T3>P. phaeocephalus</T3> are insufficient to indicate a population decline,but large numbers have been supplied to the Guam market from the islandswhere these species occur. <T3>Pteropus tokudae</T3> of Guam has not been seen since 1968. <T3>P. pilosus</T3> was described from two specimens caught in Palau duringthe 19th century. Both may be extinct.The taxonomic status of the genus is unclear, but the taxonomy here followsthat of the proposal, which in turn is based on a manuscript, ``Order ofBats, Chiroptera Blumenbach, 1779'' recently submitted by K.F. Koopmanfor <T3>Handbuch der Zoologie,</T3> Vol. 8, <T3>Mammalia.</T3> <T3>Pteropus mariannus</T3> is considered to have seven subspecies (<T3>Pteropus mariannus mariannus, P. m. loochoensis, P. m. paganensis,P. m. pelewensis, </T3> <T3>P. m. ualanus, P. m. ulithiensis, P. m. yapensis</T3>). Although flyingfoxes vary considerably in size, many species are quite similar in appearanceand therefore difficult to distinguish from one another.Due to the documented decline of several subspecies of <T3>Pteropus mariannus,</T3> it has been proposed that all seven subspeciesbe added to Appendix I. The proposal cites population declines of <T3>P. samoensis</T3> and its limited distribution as sufficient to proposeit for inclusion in Appendix I. Population declines for <T3>P. insularis</T3> on Truk and <T3>P. molossinus</T3> and <T3>P. phaeocephalus</T3> in the eastern Caroline Islands are less-welldocumented. However, because of number of these species in trade and theirextremely limited distribution we are seeking additional information thatwould support an Appendix I proposal. Although perhaps extinct, <T3>P. tokudae</T3> and <T3>pilosus</T3> nontheless have been proposed for listing in AppendixI until such time as their status is definitely resolved. Finally, <T3>P. tongangus</T3> has been proposed for listing because at least onesubspecies, <T3>P. t. tongaus,</T3> has been seriously reduced in numbers and becauseit is similar in appearance to the two less-threatened subspecies whichare heavily traded.The Service is considering the proposal to include the remaining 48 speciesof <T3>Pteropus</T3> in Appendix II because many are involved in internationaltrade and because of the difficulty in distinguishing species from eachother. However, the proposal contained few data indicating the magnitudeof international trade of these other species, or indicating that naturalpopulations have declined because of harvest for international trade. TheService is especially interested in obtaining specific information on tradein and population status of any of these 48 species, especially those occurringin the Philippines, New Guinea, Indonesia and Thailand. Any proposal wouldcontinue the present listing restriction by including only dead bats becausethe trade of concern is only of dead specimens and the regulation of theextremely limited trade in live specimens for zoological gardens wouldbe unnecessarily complicated because of the difficulty in distinguishingspecies.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Pachypodium (3 </ITAG><T3>Pachypodium</T3> spp.) and Succulent Euphorbia (10 <T3>Euphorbia</T3> spp.)The Natural Resources Defense Council has provided partial informationthat suggests the following 3 Madagascan species of <T3>Pachypodium</T3> (Apocynaceae) and 10 geophytic (usually tuberous)species of succulent <T3>Euphorbia</T3> (Euphorbiaceae) should be uplisted from Appendix IIto Appendix I. Concern for some of these species also was discussed andagreed to at the CITES Plants Committee meeting in November 1988. The speciesare: <T3>P. baronii, P. brevicaule,</T3> <T3>P. decaryi, </T3>and <T3>E. ambovombensis, </T3><T3>E. cap-saintemariensis, E. cylindrifolia, E. decaryi, E. francoisii,</T3><T3>E. moratii, </T3><T3>E. parvicyathophora, </T3><T3>E. primulifolia, </T3><T3>E. quartziticola, </T3>and <T3>E. tulearensis.</T3> Reasons for the possible uplisting are: (1) continuinginternational hobby interest in wild specimens; (2) possibly significantexport of some of these species from Madagascar; (3) the vulnerabilityof these species to such trade because of their biological characteristics(e.g., slow-growing or difficulty in propagating artificially), limiteddistributions (some have presumably lost range from collectors; some speciesare not well known), and/or localized occurrence in diminishing habitats,as well as the similar appearance of species in this group of geophytic<T3>Euphorbia.</T3> The Service particularly seeks information on theirrarity and likelihood of overcollecting.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Snowdrops (</ITAG><T3>Galanthus</T3> spp. and hybrids)The Natural Resources Defense Council also requested listing of the genus<T3>Galanthus</T3> of the Liliaceae (Amaryllidaceae), consisting of about12-14 species in Europe and the Middle East, with possibly <T3>G. fosteri,</T3> <T3>G. gracilis, </T3><T3>G. latifolius</T3> and <T3>G. rizehensis</T3> recommended for Appendix I, and the remainder ofthe genus for Appendix II in order to regulate trade in other species thatare declining at least in some areas, such as <T3>G. elwesii,</T3> and because of similarity in appearance of speciesand hybrids. All species of the genus are in accelerating demand for ornamentaluse, and most specimens are believed to be collected from the wild, especiallyin Turkey. Some common species as well as the rare species are decliningin all or portions of their native habitats, with collecting expandinginto previously less exploited areas. The need for listing the genus inAppendix II was presented to and accepted by the Plants Committee. A draftproposal for all species and hybrids is in preparation, and materials areon file. The Service is interested in information on: rarity of these speciesthroughout their ranges in the wild, specimens collected only from naturalizedpopulations (e.g., perhaps in portions of France), international traderecords for individual species, the extent of such trade in artificiallypropagated specimens, and taxonomic information as to which species arecorrectly recognized.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Cycads</ITAG>The Cycad Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission of the IUCNpresented information accepted by the Plants Commitee to uplist a new Colombiangenus, <T3>Chigua </T3>(Zamiaceae), from Appendix II to Appendix I. The reasonsfor possible uplisting are the vulnerability of the species and the interestof hobbyists to obtain the new genus, which is not yet readily availablefrom artificially propagated sources. The Deputy Chairman of the CycadGroup, who is at the New York Botanical Garden, presented the above informationand is preparing the draft proposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Palms (18 </ITAG><T3>Chamaedorea</T3> spp.)The Palm Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission of the IUCNpresented information to the Plants Committee indicating that 11 speciesof palms in the genus <T3>Chamaedorea</T3> (Palmae or Arecaceae) particularly from Mexico warrantlisting in Appendix I, or some species in Appendix II. Subsequently, informationhas been presented by the Deputy Chairman of the Palm Group on seven morespecies. The 13 species proposed for Appendix I are <T3>C. cataractarum, C. ferruginea, C. glaucifolia, C. klotzschiana, C.metallica, C. montana, C. oreophila, C. radicalis, C. seifrizii, C. stolonifera,</T3>and <T3>C. tenella</T3>, all endemic to Mexico, as well as <T3>C. amabilis</T3>, endemic to Costa Rica, and <T3>C. pulchra</T3>, endemic to Guatemala. In addition, the following fivespecies in the genus are recommended for Appendix II: <T3>C. ernesti-augusti</T3> from Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico;and <T3>C. elegans</T3> (wild populations only, artifically propagated specimensto be excluded), <T3>C. rojasiana, C. simplex</T3>, and <T3>C. tuerkheimii</T3> from Guatemala and Mexico. The reasons for thepossible listings are the vulnerability of the species and the internationaltrade in them that has been evaluated through work funded by the WorldWildlife Fund-U.S. as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development.The Deputy Chairman of the Palm Group who prepared the WWF report, is preparingthe draft proposal. The Service is interested in information on the rarityand international trade in these species, as well as any taxonomic informationas to whether these species are correctly recognized.The Chairman of the Palm Group, who is undertaking a special study on thethreatened palms of Madagascar, also presented information (accepted bythe Plants Committee) that the following three Madagascan palms requiremaximum protection under CITES. <T3>Neodypsis decaryi</T3>, known from 30 trees in one population, is proposedfor uplisting from Appendix II to Appendix I, and the very local and newlydescribed species <T3>Marojejya darianii</T3> and <T3>Voanioala gerardii</T3> are proposed for listing in Appendix I, asvirtually all their seeds are being collected for the horticultural exportmarket. The Chairman of the Palm Group is preparing the draft proposal.The Service is particularly interested in information on the rarity andinternational trade in these species, and seed production from artificiallypropagated specimens (seeds from trees grown by people outside Madagascaror under controlled conditions outside their native ranges in Madagascar).<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Artificially propagated Appendix I hybrids</ITAG>Resolution Conf. 6.19 (adopted at the July 1987 6th meeting of the Conferenceof the Parties) is not in effect for artificially propagated hybrids ofAppendix I species until a proposal has been accepted by the Parties thatdetermines which if any species should be annotated, so that such hybridsare regulated as the species, while unannotated species would have suchhybrids regulated as Appendix II species. Until such time, all such hybridsare treated as if the species were annotated (see Doc. 6.32). The UnitedStates and the Netherlands are preparing the proposal, which may recommendthat no species currently in Appendix I should be annotated. The Serviceis particularly interested in information that suggests any species nowin Appendix I should be annotated for the reasons indicated in Doc. 6.32or other specified reasons.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Red-eared slider (</ITAG><T3>Trachemys scripta elegans</T3>)The International Wildlife Coalition (IWC) has proposed that the red-earedslider (<T3>Trachemys scripta elegans</T3>) be included in Appendix II of CITES.This turtle formerly was sold in vast numbers in pet and department storesin the United States. In 1975, the Food and Drug Administration banneddomestic sales of turtles under a carapace length of four inches becauseof outbreaks of <T3>Salmonella</T3> infection caused by keeping these turtles as pets.However, commercially-reared hatchling turtles continue to be exportedto at least 30 countries for the pet trade, and, apparently, to a lesserextent for food.Despite a considerable decline in commercial farming since 1975, Servicerecords indicate that two to three million commercially reared hatchlingsare exported annually. However, according to the proposal, the turtle farmindustry estimates annual exports of four to seven million.The proposal from IWC indicates that at least 100,000 adults, with an emphasison females, are removed from the wild annually to replenish overwinterlosses of breeding stock on commercial farms. This estimate is apparentlyderived from a 1986 survey of four farms, with an extrapolation based onthe estimated number of farms in operation. A 1988 survey of an unspecifiednumber of farms apparently verifies the earlier estimates.The IWC proposal also indicates that a substantial number of wild-caughtadults are exported to Asian countries for food. One source indicated that20,000-30,000 turtles per week are captured and exported during the peakof the turtle harvest season, which runs from approximately April throughNovember. Assuming a 5-month season and 20,000 exported per week, one derivesa conservative estimate of 400,000 turtles exported annually for food.The actual number may be as high as 750,000.The red-eared slider has an extensive distribution within the United States.With western limits of the Pecos River in New Mexico, the panhandle ofOklahoma, and western Kansas, it occurs throughout Texas and the southernstates as far east as the Florida panhandle, Alabama, and central Tennessee.To the north the species occurs in most of Missouri, Illinois, and westernIndiana.Little information is available on the size of natural populations, butthe species is reported to be common throughout most of its range. Limitedsurvey data and anecdotal evidence indicate that populations have probablydeclined throughout much of Louisiana.Considerable support for this proposal has been received from environmentaland humane groups and several individuals, including professional herpetologists.Although data are limited, submitted comments suggest that populationsof this subspecies, at least locally, are threatened by harvest for internationaltrade.The Service is considering a proposal to place the red-eared slider onAppendix II because there is substantial international trade in this subspecies,and because continued and possible expansion of trade may ultimately threatenit in a significant portion of its range. The Service is especially interestedin obtaining specific information on any documented population declinesdue to harvest, on the number of commercial farms in operation, on theactual amount of take from the wild for replenishment of breeding stocksand for commercial food export, and on the location of the commercial foodharvest.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Northern Pacific Fur Seal (</ITAG><T3>Callorhinus ursinus</T3>)The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service proposes that this species beincluded on Appendix II of CITES. This fur seal was commercially harvestedin the North Pacific under the auspices of a series of International Treatiesfrom 1911 to 1984. The Interim Convention on Conservation of North PacificFur Seals of 1957 expired in 1984 and the resulting lack of regulationson the international trade in this species constitutes a continuing threatto its declining population.Since the early 1940's and 1950's, the population of about 3 million furseals has declined to 1.1 million. This species occurs in the North PacificOcean from 35anddegrees;N to 60anddegrees;N latitude. The breeding populationin the United States is centered on the Pribilof Islands and constitutes75 percent of the world population. This population has declined from 2.2million in the 1950's to a current estimate of 800,000. The last commercialharvest in the United States occurred in 1984. The Soviet Union has similarlystopped its harvest in the western Pacific. Nevertheless, there is theconcern that animals taken incidental to commercial fishing can readilyenter into international trade. Furs and other by-products have been marketedin Europe and Asia.Many studies and analyses of historical data have been made to ascertainthe causes of a precipitous population decline on the Pribilof Islands.Entanglement in discarded fishing gear has been identified as a significantcause of mortality, though not identified as a singular cause of the populationdecline. Mortality due to entanglement in active fishing gear is a seriousconsideration due to the existence of a multinational high seas drift gillnetfishery, which operates transpacific and well within the pelagic distributionof this seal.Fur seals of the genus <T3>Arctocephalus</T3> are harvested in the southern hemisphere and areactively traded internationally. Seals of this genus are already on AppendixII of CITES. Processed products of <T3>Callorlhinus</T3> and <T3>Arctocephalus</T3> present a serious similarity of appearance problem.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Northern elephant seal (</ITAG><T3>Mirounga angustirostris</T3>)The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has recommended that this speciesbe proposed for removal from Appendix II. The southern elephant seal (<T3>M. leonina</T3>) is also listed in Appendix II. There is no known internationaltrade in either species. In 1985, the CITES Management Authority for Argentinasuggested postponing its delisting for several years because of uncertaintyabout whether harvesting of the southern elephant seal might resume (exploitationceased in 1961). Mexico, which harbors a major population of northern elephantseals, is not a Party to CITES, but has protected this species. Uncontrolledharvest in the United States is prohibited under the Marine Mammal ProtectionAct. The prohibitions against harvesting both species of elephant sealshave been in effect for many years and the Parties have recorded no tradein either species since CITES entered into force. Inclusion of the northernelephant seal in Appendix II has no relation to the ongoing monitoringof its population status or to the effective protection status conferredon this species by the Mexican and U.S. Governments. There is no indicationthat exploitation of southern elephant seals will resume; if that wereto happen, and if it became necessary to include the northern species becauseof similarity in appearance, it is always possible to place the latterspecies again on Appendix II.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. Cycad Seeds</ITAG>The Cycad Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission presentedinformation to the CITES Plants Committee that seeds of Appendix II cycads(Cycadaceae and Zamiaceae) should be delisted. This conclusion was acceptedby the Committee, which also noted that such a change would conform withlack of regulation of seeds of other Appendix II species. The reasons forpossible delisting are: (1) overcollecting of wild seeds of rare speciesdoes not seem to be occurring, perhaps because artificially propagatedspecimens are so readily available; (2) some species produce relativelylarge numbers of seeds, and trade in their wild seeds is unnecessarilyencumbered; (3) regulating the seeds as the whole plants provides no incentiveto collect seeds rather than whole specimens, and to maintain the wildpopulation as a seed source; and (4) the majority of the trade, which isin seeds of artificially propagated plants, is unnecessarily encumbered.The Deputy Chairman of the Cycad Group, who is at the New York BotanicalGarden, presented the above information. The Service is particularly interestedin information suggesting that the seeds should remain regulated.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. 10-Year Review Actions </ITAG>The following nine plant species have been listed since 1973; seven ofthem are proposed for delisting and 2 for downlisting as part of the on-goingreview of plant species initiated with the 10-year review called for inresolution Conf. 3.20. The five species in Appendix I proposed for delistingand the reasons are: <T3>Alocasia zebrina </T3>(Araceae), more common than thought, readilyavailable as artificially propagated specimens and without an internationaldemand in wild specimens; <T3>Caryocar costaricense </T3>(Caryocaraceae), more common than thoughtand not in international demand; <T3>Prepusa hookeriana </T3>(Gentianaceae), not in international demand;<T3>Lavoisiera itambana </T3>(Melastomataceae), not in international demand;and <T3>Guarea longipetiola </T3>(Meliaceae), a synonym of a more common species.The two species of palms (Palmae or Arecaceae) in Appendix II proposedfor delisting because they are not in international trade are <T3>Phoenix hanceana </T3>var. <T3>philippinensis </T3>and <T3>Salacca clemensiana. </T3>The two Appendix I species proposed for downlistingto Appendix II because they are more common and less in international demandthan thought are <T3>Tachigalia versicolor </T3>(Leguminosae or Fabaceae) and <T3>Welwitschia mirabilis </T3>(Welwitschiaceae). The Service is particularlyinterested in any information suggesting that any of these species shouldbe treated differently than proposed above.Comments on bred-in-capitivity requirements were received and will be consideredin development of U.S. criteria for registration of facilities that mayseek certification of their stock as ``bred-in-captivity.''However, no request was received to submit a species for acceptance bythe Parties as being bred-in-captivity in accordance with resolution Conf.6.21. <ITAG tagnum="84">Future Actions </ITAG>The Service plans to publish a further <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice to announce its decisions on the speciesproposals discused above. The U.S. proposals must be submitted to the CITESSecretariat by May 12, 1989, for consideration at the next regular meetingof the Conference of the Parties. Persons having current biological ortrade information about these species are invited to contact the Service'sOffice of Scientific Authority at the above address.
