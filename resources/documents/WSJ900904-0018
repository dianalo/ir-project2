The utility, which had asked for a $22.5 million, or 5.8%,increase, will receive an increase of about $10.5 million, or2.7%, for the first year.

Now &quot;profitswill be tied to the utility's performance in helping itscustomers be more energy efficient,&quot; he said.   Under the agreement, Orange andamp; Rockland will installenergy-saving devices free of charge for many of itsresidential and commercial customers beginning in January. Italso will provide rebates to customers who install variousenergy-saving devices such as high-efficiency motors andnon-electrically driven cooling systems.   &quot;The purpose of the program is to reduce the total energycosts of both residential and business consumers,&quot; Mr. DeWittsaid. Consumers who participate in these programs areexpected to see a reduction of 2% to 10% in their monthlybills.</TEXT></DOC>
