The March contract ended just shy of its high for the day, settling at 8.7 cents a pound, up 0.21 cent.    F.O. Licht, the West German sugar statistical firm, in its third estimate of the 1987-88 season that began Sept. 1, yesterday placed world sugar production at 104.2 million metric tons. This was up from its first estimate in October of 103.5 million tons, but slightly below the approximately 104.4 million tons produced in 1986-87.    William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., said the latest estimate tended to mitigate somewhat the impact of the firm's surprising Feb. 2 forecast of a one-million-ton increase in Soviet production.    Licht, in that forecast, estimated Soviet output for 1987-88 at 9.7 million tons, up from 8.7 million tons in 1986-87.    The latest estimate -- along with adverse Soviet weather conditions reported last year and their negative effect on the Soviet grain crop -- is leading to a growing disbelief in the 9.7-million-ton forecast, Mr. O'Neill said. &quot;But we won't know until the season wears on,&quot; he said.    Futures also drew support from Licht's report that reserve stocks as a percentage of consumption was 31.81%, or about a four months' reserve supply of sugar at the current rate of usage, Mr. O'Neill said. This was down from Licht's October estimate of 32.86%, and down from 33.82% on Aug. 31, 1987.    A dealer said China bought 40,000 tons of raw sugar this weekend, bringing its total purchases so far to about 350,000 tons. Pakistan bought about 60,000 tons of refined sugar, he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   ENERGY: Heating-oil futures for current delivery slipped 0.23 cent, to 46.37 cents a gallon, partly because some traders were already anticipating the end of a New York harbor barge strike announced yesterday. Analysts said futures prices had been buoyed by the prospect of near-term supply disruptions caused by a strike. Now, they said, traders are anticipating a possible supply surge when the strike is over. Crude-oil dropped eight cents, to $16.67 a barrel. Extremely mild weather in Europe has in general depressed energy futures. Thus, the major action yesterday was the selling of current contracts and the buying of later ones by traders who are &quot;bullish for the long haul,&quot; said James Ritterbusch, an energy analyst at PaineWebber Inc., Chicago.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean-futures prices slumped amid heavy selling by farmers to grain elevators, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. The elevators depressed futures prices by selling contracts to hedge the soybeans they bought from farmers. The farmer selling was apparently triggered by the rise in soybean prices last week. Soybean-futures prices were also depressed by news of rain in Brazil, which reinforced projections for a strong soybean harvest in South America this spring. Wheat-futures prices closed mixed amid rumors that the Soviet Union might soon purchase an additional 500,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat. Corn-futures prices slipped on continuing speculation that the Agriculture Department is mulling whether to auction some of its huge corn stockpile as early as April. A high-ranking department official, however, denied the rumor. &quot;It's not even under consideration,&quot; he said.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices on deferred cattle contracts are expected to drop at the open of trading today in the wake of news that more young cattle than expected were placed on feedlots for fattening in January, said Ted Ryan, president of Research Department Inc., Chicago. According to a monthly Agriculture Department report released after trading closed yesterday, the number of young cattle placed on feedlots in its seven-state survey rose 4% in January. Most traders expected a 4.5% drop; instead they got the largest number of cattle placed on feed in January since 1974, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. The rise in placements follows sharp drops in November and December, and indicates feedlot operators are growing more optimistic about long-term cattle prices. The Agriculture Department said total cattle on feed on Feb. 1, rose 8% from a year earlier. Traders had expected a 6% increase.    ALUMINUM: A rally in London brought to life the generally quiet aluminum pit at the Commodity Exchange in New York. The current-delivery contract surged 2.25 cents, to 98 cents a pound, in the second-heaviest trading of the year. Prices rose in London Monday, when the Comex was closed, on a sharp fall in London Metal Exchange inventories. J. Clarence Morrison, metals analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., New York, said prices -- currently 13% higher than at the end of 1987 -- have been supported by merchants entering the market to replenish stocks and by heavy demand from industrial customers. </TEXT></DOC>
