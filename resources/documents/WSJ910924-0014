About one in 20 people has a significant diseaseor condition causing disability due to a genetic disease.Further, up to 50% of children in pediatric hospitals havedisorders that are known to be strongly influenced by geneticfactors.   The genes for most of these disorders have not yet beenidentified. However, we are in the early stages of a majorrevolution in medical science resulting in the cloning ofgenes and new diagnostic technologies. The importance of DNAbanking is that it ensures people in future generations won'tbe denied access to diagnostic services by virtue of nothaving blood available from crucial family relatives.</LP><TEXT>   In our own experience in Canada we have been running a DNAbank for seven years and have collected more than 3,000samples of DNA from patients with Huntington disease, some ofwhom have already died without access to DNA of appropriatepatients. Many people at risk for Huntington disease wouldhave been denied access to predictive testing without a DNAbank in place.   We strongly support the establishment of a professionalDNA bank to ensure that this possibility will be available tomany other people in the general community who are at riskfor other disorders that might have a genetic component. Forthis reason I strongly applaud the vision of Vivigen Inc. insetting up this facility.   Michael R.
