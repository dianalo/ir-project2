The report, a policy statement by the American Academy ofPediatrics, says use of tranquilizers such as diazepam,antidepressants such as imipramine, and 17 other similarmedications ``may be of concern'' to nursing mothers. Diazepam ismarketed as Valium and imipramine is marketed as Tofranil,SK-Pramine and Imavate.   The effect of such drugs on babies who ingest them throughbreast milk is unknown, said the academy, an organization of 37,000pediatricians which is based in suburban Elk Grove Village.   ``It's a dilemma,'' said Dr. Cheston Berlin, a member of the AAPCommittee on Drugs and author of the report. ``For some of thesewomen, nursing's important to them. Taking their medication is alsogoing to be important.''   The committee stopped short of advising women against usinganti-depressants, anti-anxiety drugs and anti-psychotics,recommending rather that women consult their doctors.   ``The emphasis should be that the nursing mother discuss it withher physician, and the two of them decide what's best for both''mother and child, said Berlin, who heads the general pediatricsdivision at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pa.   The report is an update of the academy's 1983 statement.   It lists 130 drugs and divides them into groups: those thatshould not be taken by nursing mothers; those known to be safe;those that can be used with caution; those that can be used if themother temporarily halts breast-feeding; and those whose effectsare unknown, a newly compiled section.   The committee said the vast majority of drugs a nursing woman islikely to take are ``usually compatible with breast-feeding.''   Physicians should always ask themselves whether the motherreally needs the drug in question and should choose the safestdrug, the committee said.   For example, nursing women who need pain relievers should take anon-aspirin medication rather than aspirin, which can affect aninfant's chemical balance, blood-clotting or can cause a rash.   The committee also suggested physicians consider doing bloodtests on infants of nursing mothers taking drugs that may be ofconcern. And the risk from a medication may be minimized by havingthe mother take it after a feeding or before the infant isscheduled for its longest sleep, the committee said.   Jeanine Klaus, president of the International LactationConsultants Association, praised the academy's recommendation thateach woman consult her physician.   ``It cushions the warnings on any particular drug, putting itinto an appropriate perspective,'' said Ms. Klaus, whose group iscomprised of 2,000 health care professionals.   ``What they are saying is, `Maintain this breast-feedingrelationship _ use caution _ but try to maintain it,''' she said ina telephone interview Saturday from Atlanta.   Estimates on the number of women who suffer severe emotionalproblems after giving birth range from 4 percent to 10 percent, butup to 80 percent of new mothers may have milder cases of ``babyblues,'' she said.   Julie Stock, a spokeswoman for La Leche League International, aFranklin Park, Ill.-based group that offers support and informationfor nursing mothers, said many women may be incorrectly prescribeddrugs for post-partum emotional problems.   ``Rather than counseling a woman ... it's easy to write aprescription,'' she said.   ``If women gave birth in a more supportive environment and camehome with the babies to a more supportive environment, I thinkfewer women would be plunged into post-partum depression,'' Stocksaid.</TEXT></DOC>
