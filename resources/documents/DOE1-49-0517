A 4-FrenchSimmons catheter was introduced into the right transbrachial artery.Examination time averaged 25 minutes. Diatrizoate meglumine 30% was usedand contrast volumes averaged 30-50 ml per examination. Eleven complicationsoccurred. Seven were considered minor;four were potentially serious.Advantages include the ability to obtain lateral views of the bifurcation,imaging of the intracranial circulation, small contrast volumes, andshortened examination times. The examination was considered superiorto both intravenous and intraarterial aortic arch DSA studies.</TEXT></DOC>
