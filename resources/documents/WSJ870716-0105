Campbell Co. in Los Angeles. But when communication was established, the message came through loud and clear: a buy recommendation for the Mexican phone company.    All through 1986, Telefonos de Mexico's American depository receipts, each representing one share, hovered between nine and 12 cents apiece. But in May the receipts began to climb and are currently trading at around 41 cents, bid.    &quot;The stock is still undervalued, compared to other telephone companies in the world,&quot; says D.A. Campbell Vice President Sandra Howard.    Logic has it that a successful company is one that keeps its customers happy by selling a good product at a fair price. The Telmex stock boom defies that logic: Customers complain incessantly. Calls often don't go through. Operators sometimes take half an hour to answer the phone. Lines mysteriously go dead, and repairmen won't fix them unless paid tips. Mexican hotels post warnings in guest rooms that the government slaps a 35% long-distance tax and a 15% value-added tax on calls.    One European investment bank in Mexico City recently found its telephone number changed, rendering obsolete all its stationery and business cards. A leading Mexico City newspaper donates space to customers complaining about their phones.    And yet, in another recent buy recommendation, Mexico City economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O ticked off Telmex's &quot;ambitious plans,&quot; its &quot;top government priority in terms of investment&quot; and its &quot;good management.&quot;    How can a company that irks so many customers be a belle on Wall Street?    Ms. Howard credits a Telmex dividend policy that began in the second quarter. She also thinks Telmex's market success reflects a reawakening of investor curiosity about Mexico this year. The Mexican stock market has been the world's top performer since January, and Telmex is one of only four Mexican companies whose depository receipts trade in the U.S.    And then there is Telmex's monopoly grip on the Mexican phone market.    &quot;It's like the light company,&quot; says Ms. Howard. &quot;If I need light, I can't complain when the lights go out. What's a consumer going to do?&quot;    What customers do is get in the queue. Each day, lines of them snake across the lobbies of Telmex's branch offices in the capital to report broken telephones. The customers must call in their problems from a phone hanging on the wall. But the lines move slowly; the dispatcher typically takes 40 minutes to answer.    &quot;This has happened to me four or five times since February,&quot; says television repairman Jorge Recio Garcia, waiting in line to report his broken telephone. Every time his phone has been fixed, a neighbor's phone goes on the blink, he says. When that phone is fixed, another neighbor's breaks. &quot;It's like a chain,&quot; he says.    Mr. Recio concludes that repairmen are deliberately breaking the phones, so that he and his neighbors will pay them for repairs. (Phone repairs in Mexico are supposed to be free.)    Behind Mr. Recio in line stands a man carrying legal documents saying he is paying bills for his broken phone only under protest. A white-haired man says this is the fourth day in a row he has come to report his dead phone. Still another says a car crashed in his neighborhood two weeks ago and knocked out phone service; no one has come to restore it.    &quot;This is horrible -- very ugly,&quot; says the branch manager, whose office looks out over the line of angry customers. She looks at Telmex from a middle-management point of view: She believes it is a great institution being run downhill by its union. When she joined the company 24 years ago, she says, an office worker typically filled out 70 new-phone applications a day. Today, she says, the average is 20.    &quot;They attack people who work,&quot; she says. &quot;I say to them, 'Boys, be nice to the people. What does it cost you to say good morning, how are you?' They say, 'It doesn't say in my contract that I have to say good morning. It doesn't say in my contract that I have to smile.'&quot;    As if on cue, a union delegate enters the office and plunks a stack of papers on the manager's desk. This is a Wednesday, and the papers are notices that various employees will go on vacations the following Monday -- one for 63 days, one for 41 days, one for 36 days.    &quot;I won't have time to find replacements,&quot; the manager objects, but the union representative says she is in a hurry and bustles out of the office.    &quot;Poor Mexico, when we have leaders like that one,&quot; says the manager.    In his office in another part of the city, union Secretary-General Francisco Hernandez Juarez offers a different analysis of Telmex. He says the company's misfortunes stem from Mexico City's disastrous 1985 earthquake, and from a tendency in Mexico to bad-mouth state enterprises. (The government owns a majority of Telmex's stock.)    Operators don't answer the phones promptly, he agrees, and repairmen don't always come winging to the sites of broken phones. But that is because the computers that back up the workers crash frequently, he says. Sometimes, he concedes, workers perform poorly on purpose -- but only because they are demoralized by automation, and by the failure of wage increases to match Mexico's rampant inflation.    &quot;The workers would be less tempted to use these tactics if they were paid a decent wage,&quot; he says, noting that the average worker earns about $8.50 a day. &quot;The union realizes the atmosphere surrounding phone service gives the union a bad image. But legally, it is the phone company that provides the service. If a user has a problem, he should blame the company.&quot;    Company headquarters stands tall over central Mexico City in a vaguely M-shaped tower. There are no lines of angry customers, no cowed managers, no bossy subordinates. Secretaries answer ringing telephones. The talk is of decentralization, fiber optics, data transmission, even -- as last year's annual report puts it -- &quot;a labor relationship marked by a high spirit of collaboration.&quot;    Here one learns that Telmex installed almost 400,000 phones across Mexico last year. It introduced 217 isolated villages to the telephone. It improved services to long-complaining processing plants on the northern border. It built four long-distance exchanges in the capital, replacing a single center flattened in the 1985 earthquake. It hopes to end the computer crashes in a few months.    A Telmex executive calls the company &quot;one of the healthiest telephone companies in the world&quot; in terms of its balance sheet. He says service problems are, in part, a result of Telmex's price structure. Long-distance revenues keep Telmex in the black; local service is price-controlled and unprofitable. Thus, repair and installation service in poor neighborhoods, where few make long-distance calls, is low priority.    &quot;I'd like to charge for (repair) service,&quot; says an executive, indicating that would solve some of the problems. But officials at higher levels of government won't let him, he says. </TEXT></DOC>
