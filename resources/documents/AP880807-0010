They're in spaciousenclosures, in a much more aesthetically pleasing environment,''said Charles H. Hoessle, director of the St. Louis Zoo. ``Modernexhibits are being designed to cater to their behavioral needs.''   The trend is evident at the new Central Park Zoo, wherewilderness has been duplicated in the heart of the city. Therevamped facility opens to the public on Monday.   Robert Wagner, executive director of the American Association ofZoological Parks and Aquariums, which grants accreditation, saidthe new Central Park Zoo ``clearly depicts the latest state of theart.''   Experts at the zoo let the animals tell them what changes tomake. For example, sea lions from the New York Aquarium wereinvited to work the kinks out of the new pool. And other zoos arefinding ways to keep their animals entertained.   ``It's quite common in ape exhibits to put sunflower seeds onthe floor so animals have something to do to keep them occupied, orartificial termite mounds with honey or mustard,'' said MarvinJones, registrar of the San Diego Zoo. ``It's a way of easing theirboredom.''   Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla., was a trend-setter in 1965,enclosing visitors on a monorail while the gazelles and zebrasfrolicked unfettered on 60 acres. In the early 1970s, drive-throughparks proliferated.   Since then, realistic settings have multiplied. In 1987, the zooassociation's 132 members spent nearly $500 million building orrenovating exhibits, Wagner said. ``American zoos are in theirheyday,'' he said.   ``The public has changed, due to television primarily. Peopleare able to see how animals live in the wild'' and expect no lessfrom zoos, Jones said.   The Bronx Zoo's Jungle World, a 37,000-square-foot, indoormicrocosm opened in 1985, boasts five waterfalls, a cloud machine,100 species of tropical plants and 780 animals, includingendangered Bali mynah birds.   In St. Louis, school children and scholars can study ecology andendangered species next spring while viewing one-celled animals anda ``living model'' of a Missouri Ozarks stream at the zoo's new $16million, 55,000-square-foot educational complex.   Visitors in Atlanta perch on a wooden observation platform, a lasafari, to experience the world's only naturalistic, multifamilygorilla complex. The zoo was renovated after it lost accreditationamid grisly stories of animal abuse.   ``Where we can put animals on grass with natural foliage, fresh,bubbling water and open sky, it makes us feel a whole lot better _and as far as I know, the animals like it better,'' said Gerald S.Lentz, zoological manager of Busch Gardens, which boasts 21 Asianelephants and other endangered species among its 3,300 mammals,birds and reptiles.   Such amenities are necessary: zoos must breed more endangeredspecies _ while at the same time captivating public sentiment forthat cause.   While animals aren't fooled by fake jungles or fields, thewildlife settings ``help provide the visitor with a sense ofappreciation for the conservation of wild places,'' Wagner said.   ``Zoos are becoming a last resort for vanishing species.Municipal peoples, who are furthest from wildlife but who supportzoos, are ultimately beginning to play an ever larger role inhelping to sustain wildlife,'' said Dr. William Conway, director ofthe New York Zoological Society.   ``The new role of zoos is coming about because there are toodamn many people,'' Conway said. ``Within the next 20 or 30 years,we will lose, at the very least, 20 percent of the remaining plantand animal species on earth.''   Zoos are not only focusing their efforts on breeding endangeredspecies, such as San Diego's California condor program, but arealso educating the public about them.   ``We don't give a darn if people know that Asian elephants havethe bigger ears and African elephants the smaller ears,'' Conwaysaid. ``But if they like elephants, they may reflect upon themeaning of elephants the next time they tickle the ivory keys ontheir piano that resulted in some elephant's death.''   Zoo association members share endangered animals andtechnologies. There are special breeding facilities operated inFront Royal, Va., by the National Zoological Park; on St.Catherines Island, Ga., by the New York Zoological Park, and theZoological Park of San Diego. The New York society's WildlifeConservation International sponsors scientists in 35 countries.   There also is a zoo movement in reverse. In November, zooassociation members shipped endangered mynah birds back to Bali,where agricultural development had gobbled their native rainforests. Early reports are that the program is a success, Wagnersaid.   Similar successes have occurred with the return of black buckantelopes to Pakistan; tamarin monkeys to Brazil, and Arabianoryxes, another type of antelope, to Jordan, he said.   ``There is no substitute for nature,'' Conway said. ``We seek,instead, to be a salesman for nature.''</TEXT></DOC>
