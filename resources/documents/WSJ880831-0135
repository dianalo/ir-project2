By a vote of 191 to 5, the ruling council of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, meeting in Chicago, agreed to permit the institute's 272,000 members to accept contingency fees from clients, and commissions from suppliers recommended to clients by accountants. Accountants had long opposed such arrangements as possible conflicts of interest.    By dropping the bans on contingency fees, accountants can now be paid a percentage of savings or profits the accountants help a client achieve. Under previous professional rules accountants could only charge hourly fees for such advice.    Under a compromise with the Federal Trade Commission, which began an antitrust investigation of the bans a few years ago, there would still be one major exception. The bans would remain in force for clients where accounting firms perform audits, do financial reviews, compile data, and examine predictions of financial positions, operating results and future cash flows.    A. Marvin Strait, the institute's chairman, said the exception &quot;leaves untouched our ability to adopt reasonable rules (involving clients) for whom we do work that will be relied on by third parties.&quot; He added: &quot;We continue to believe that the accounting profession is different from other professions against whom the FTC has taken action. Our requirements of independence and objectivity are crucial to continued public confidence in our work.&quot;    Under the agreement, accountants would be required to disclose to clients that the accountants have accepted fees from others for products or services referred to the clients.    The compromise with the FTC also requires the institute to drop bans against advertising that had forbidden self-laudatory statements or testimonials by clients. In the late 1970s, under pressure from the FTC, the institute dropped an outright ban against all advertising by its members.    The FTC for at least a decade has been pressing professionals, including accountants, attorneys, physicians and dentists, to get rid of professional ethics bans that the FTC feels are anti-competitive.    The FTC at first had wanted the institute bans to be dropped for all work performed by accountants. But after the institute council voted four times since 1984 to keep the bans, the federal agency in recent months was willing to compromise. Several institute members recently threatened to sue the institute if the bans weren't lifted. The institute's outside counsel advised that the bans couldn't be upheld in the current legal climate of open competition for the professions.    The latest institute agreement with the FTC staff is subject to public comment over a two-month period and review by the full commission. </TEXT></DOC>
