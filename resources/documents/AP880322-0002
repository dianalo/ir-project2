In an hour-long meeting on Capitol Hill, Reagan appealed toRepublican House members to unite behind a new effort to pushthrough Congress some kind of help for the Contras, whose last U.S.aid ran out Feb. 29.   Later, speaking at a fund-raising reception for the re-electioncampaign of Sen. Chic Hecht, R-Nev., the president, as he hasbefore, linked last week's incursion into Honduras by troops ofNicaragua's leftist Sandinista government to the defeat of hisrequest for funds for the rebels.   ``The logistical preparation for the incursion began just afterCongress voted to reject our package of aid to the democraticresistance,'' he said. ``This was a precise and carefully plannedoperation that showed the influence of outside advisers and musthave required several weeks to plan.''   Rebel supporters said their chances of prevailing on thedivisive issue were improved by the incursion, which was makingsome moderates nervous about leaving the rebels without aid.   ``Some were quite pale in their appearance when they realizedthere was this incursion,'' said Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., thechief House GOP vote counter. ``We think there is some potentialthere to get a few more votes than we had in the past.''   One member of the ``swing'' group, Rep. Buddy MacKay, D-Fla.,said he was preparing a compromise aid package and was seeking thesupport of other moderates. ``All we are trying to say is thatleaving the situation as it is, is unacceptable,'' MacKay said.   ``We are determined to get continued assistance to theresistance, and if we stick together, this time we'll make it,''Reagan told the closed meeting with lawmakers, according to a textof his remarks provided by the White House. He declined to offerdetails on what kind of package he was asking for.   Alluding to Democratic efforts to thwart any military aid forthe Contras, Reagan added: ``Those who led the fight against ourpackage of assistance to the democratic resistance cannot escaperesponsibility'' if the rebel forces wither.   Later, in a session with local-government Republican officials,the president again pointed the finger of blame at House Democrats.   ``The House leadership, who played hardball to win the vote tocut off aid, now says it won't accept responsibility for thedestruction of the freedom fighters. But if the freedom fightersare extinguished and communist rule is consolidated in Nicaragua,the American people will be the ones to decide who isresponsible,'' he contended.   Democrats immediately tossed the blame back, insisting that itwas Republicans who were responsible for the narrow House defeat ofa package of strictly ``humanitarian'' aid _ food, clothing,medicine and shelter _ on March 3.   ``What we're seeing is a public relations campaign here,'' saidRep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif. ``The Republicans are very nervous aboutit because the finger's pointed right at them.''   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, renewed his offer to votequickly on a package of purely humanitarian aid if Republicans willask for discussions. But he said any proposal containing militaryequipment would be subject to normal committee review.   ``The door is open, the welcome mat is laid,'' Wright said.   The continued wrangling seemed to make the rebels themselvesdespair of any quick action to renew the money flow, and theyreleased a television advertisement to begin airing this week thatmakes a direct appeal to U.S. viewers for contributions.   ``Your Congress abandoned us,'' Ernesto Palazio, a Washingtonlobbyist for the rebels, says somberly in the spot. ``We havenowhere to turn but to individual Americans like you.''   The spot, which asks for money for ``medicine, blankets and foodfor our families and children,'' was to begin running this week inWashington, Charlotte, N.C. and Fort Worth, Texas _ Wright's hometown.   A Washington Post-ABC News poll of 1,007 Americans found that 55percent of those surveyed opposed Reagan's dispatch of U.S. troopslast week to train in Honduras, and 62 percent thought the troopswould become involved in the fighting. The margin of error was plusor minus 4 percentage points.   The poll, conducted by telephone interviews Thursday throughMonday, found that 40 percent of those surveyed favored aid to theContras and 56 percent opposed it. It was the highest supportfigure since the 43 percent level recorded on July 15, 1987, theday after former White House aide Oliver North testified beforeCongress.   The White House has encouraged a bipartisan group of Contrasupporters in the Senate who are proposing a one-year, $48 millionpackage of non-lethal aid that also would give the CIA the right todeliver previously stockpiled weapons. Under that plan, thepresident also would have the right to get a quick vote in Congresson sending new military aid under certain conditions.   MacKay's version, still being drafted, would contain acompromise on Reagan's future ability to demand a quick vote. Incontrast with the Senate bill, MacKay's would let the presidenttrigger an expedited vote, but would not let him dictate the kindof aid package to be voted on. That would be left to normallegislative procedures, he said.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters afterReagan's Capitol Hill visit that the administration has not yetaligned itself with any specific bill, but would like to have apackage introduced soon and a vote before Congress leaves next weekon an Easter recess.   ``We'd like to have a vote before then,'' Fitzwater said.   But House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois said itwould be difficult to bring the matter to a vote before the week ofApril 11, when Congress returns to session.</TEXT></DOC>
