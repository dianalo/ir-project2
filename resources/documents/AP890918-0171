(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An armed teen-ager apparently acting out thescenario to a Stephen King novel stalked into a high schoolclassroom and took 11 classmates hostage Monday. After a daylongstandoff, he released them all and surrendered.   No one was injured in the confrontation, which began about 9:50a.m. and ended at 6:35 p.m., police said. The youth fired two shots,one at the ceiling of the classroom and another at a window, statepolice said.   The teen-ager, whose only request to police was to speak to hisfather, told his hostages he did not want to hurt anyone. The finaltwo hostages were freed shortly after 5 p.m. EDT, and the youth gaveup an hour and a half later, authorities said.   The hostage-taker was identified by police as Dustin Pierce, a17-year-old senior at Jackson County High School who was describedas a good student.   Police said they were unsure what charges would be lodged againstPierce. He was taken to a juvenile holding center in the Clay CountyJail in nearby Manchester. McKee is a town of 250 people about 50miles southeast of Lexington in the Appalachian foothills.   ``He was unbalanced,'' said state police Detective Bob Stephens,who negotiated with Pierce throughout the day at the high school.``He was a confused young man. He was a young man looking forsomebody to help him.''   Throughout the negotiations, Stephens said he feared Pierce wouldtry to kill himself since he seemed to be carrying out the scenarioof the Stephen King thriller ``Rage,'' which he had been reading.   During a search of Pierce's room at home, police found apaperback copy of the book, in which the lead character is shot bypolice. The book tells the story of a high school boy who hates hisfather and begins bringing his father's pistol to school.Eventually, the lead character in the story takes a class of 24students hostage and kills a teacher.   Police also found papers Pierce had written that made referencesto dying at 9 o'clock.   At one point during the day, ``he said it'll all end at nine,''Stephens said. Pierce's sole demand throughout was to talk to hisfather, Stephens said.   ``He hasn't seen his father, my understanding, since he's 4 yearsold,'' Stephens said.   Pierce's father, who was not identified, was on his way to McKeefrom Delray Beach, Fla., when the student released his last twohostages and surrendered.   ``He never would commit to why he wanted to talk to his father,''Stephens said.   Psychologists and FBI experts who assisted Stephens pored over``Rage'' during the day and relayed its details to the negotiators.After reading the book and Pierce's notes, ``We thought suicide waswhat we'd have to deal with at the end,'' Stephens said.   Stephens said he pressed to end the standoff before the 9 o'clocktime mentioned in the notes. He said Pierce never threatened to harmanyone else.   Pierce, who released his hostages throughout the day in exchangefor items such as food, soft drinks and cigarettes, ``said he wasn'tgoing to hurt nobody,'' according to Craig Eversole, a classmate whowas held but released. ``He said he wasn't going to shoot nobody.''   Police Trooper Ed Robinson said the hostage-taker was armed witha shotgun, a .357-caliber Magnum revolver and ``some type ofautomatic pistol.'' Eversole identified the other weapons as a.44-caliber Magnum and a 12-gauge shotgun.   Robinson also said the teen-ager apparently had held one hostageovernight _ the son of school Principal Betty Bond. He said the twoboys arrived at school in the younger Bond's red pickup, and itappeared that the armed youth had been holding the principal's sonsince the night before.   It was not clear why the youth took over the classroom.Authorities described him as a newcomer to the school who was livingwith his grandparents, but some students said they had known him foryears.   State Police Capt. John Lile said the boy's parents are separated.   Eversole, a 15-year-old junior, said he was in the classroom whenthe armed youth came through the door.   ``He never said nothing,'' Eversole said. ``He shot the ceilingand told the teacher to leave and let two rows of students leave.... He didn't say nothing, why he was doing it or nothing.''   Later, Pierce fired another shot, blowing out a classroom windowto allow Bond, the original hostage, to get an AM-FM radio andtelephone, Lile said.   Eversole was released at about 1:30 p.m. after soda was deliveredto the room _ apparently as part of a deal with police.   Earlier, Robinson said the boy fired one shot at a newshelicopter from WCPO-TV in Cincinnati shortly before 1 p.m. But astate police spokesman in Frankfort later denied that shots werefired at the helicopter.   Nearly 500 other students at the high school were evacuated afterthe incident began.   Valerie Hurst, at the Justice Hurst Funeral Home across thestreet from the high school, said students evacuated to her buildingwere frightened.   ``We had a couple to pass out and had to call an ambulance forone who had a heart condition,'' she said.   She said the boy was described by people she talked to as a goodstudent.</TEXT></DOC>
