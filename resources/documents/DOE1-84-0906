The two goals are related, as those who support themargue that decisions made close to the constituency involved will reflectthe demands of that constituency better than decisions made in Washington,D.C. Once in office, Reagan's administrators were quick to act on thesepromises. Specific policies, such as those controlling air and waterpollution and the surface mining of energy resources, were altered drasticallyto increase the discretion of state regulators at the expense of thecentral government. There would be little reason to change the methodby which decisions are reached unless one hoped to affect the policyoutcome. Most interests involved in environmental/energy questions tendedto agree: the more limited the federal role, the less strict regulationwas likely to be; the more freedom industry was likely to obtain. Itis, however, possible that decentralization of decision making may havethe opposite effect in some cases. Some states may prefer a more environmentallyconserving policy than the federal government would.</TEXT></DOC>
