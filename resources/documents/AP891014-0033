Bush, continuing to defend his decision not to intervene in thefailed coup attempt by Panamanian military officers last week,said, ``I wouldn't mind using force if it could be done in aprudent manner.''   But, he said, ``I hope I would never be reckless enough as acommander in chief to make a blanket commitment to use of forcewithout knowing the facts regarding some coup attempt.''   He called complaints that he should have used military power toback up his repeated calls for Panamanians to oust Noriega ``astupid argument that some very erudite people make.''   In a brief news conference at the White House, Bush also avoidedsaying whether he would veto newly passed legislation to loosenrestrictions on federal funding for abortions. He said he stillopposes giving federal money for abortions for poor women who arevictims of rape and incest.   But he said he wants to ``see if there is room for flexibility''to ``avoid a veto on my part'' after Senate and House negotiatorswork out a compromise version of a bill on abortion funding.   As to the lack of U.S. military backing for the Panamanianinsurgents who tried to overthrow Noriega on Oct. 3, Bush said heis not ``ruling out the use of force for all time.''   However, he said, ``I am not going to give carte blanche supportto an operation, particularly when they don't ask for this support... I have at stake the lives of American kids and I am not goingto easily thrust them into a battle unless I feel comfortable withit and unless those general officers in whom I have totalconfidence feel comfortable.''   He reiterated that he believes he made the right decisions, butsaid his administration was reviewing procedures to see ``if wecan't do it better.''   He also said it is ``well worth looking into'' the complaint bythe widow of the coup leader, Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, about poortelephone communications during the insurgency.   Mrs. Giroldi said coup leaders were rebuffed when they used atelephone number that U.S. authorities had provided foremergencies, and Americans who answered demanded to know why theywere using the line.   ``To the degree we can improve our communications, fine,'' Bushsaid.   As a result of an internal review, the administration hasdecided a crisis-management team will be automatically convened inthe White House situation room in future emergencies, a seniorofficial said.   The Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions that the Bushadministration, without changing an executive order banningassassinations of foreign leaders, has chosen to legally interpret``assassination'' as referring only to premeditated politicalmurder.   A new legal ruling, drafted by the Office of the Army JudgeAdvocate General, would permit clandestine operations even if theythreaten the lives of foreign figures.   Unidentified administration officials quoted by the Times saidthe ruling would significantly expand the scope of militaryoperations the United States could legally launch againstterrorists, drug lords or fugitives abroad, the newspaper reported.   At the news conference, Bush also said:   _He will not veto a bill outlawing flag burning, but will let itbecome law without his signature. He said he doesn't think the lawwill withstand court challenges and he will push for his preferredalternative _ a constitutional amendment that would accomplish thesame thing.   _He still wants Congress to approve his capital gains tax cutproposal. He did not say he would veto legislation that combinedhis proposal with a Democratic version liberalizing IndividualRetirement Accounts. A few hours later, Senate leaders agreed on aplan to strip hundreds of special-interest provisions from a $14.1billion deficit-reduction bill, leaving the capital gains fight forthe future.</TEXT></DOC>
