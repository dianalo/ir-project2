Introduction  </ITAG>The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for regulating the saleand use of pesticide products under the authority of the Federal Insecticide,Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), (7 U.S.C. 136 <T3>et seq</T3>). FIFRA contains a standard for registration that allowsEPA to take both the risks and the benefits of a pesticide's use into account. The Agency also regulates pesticide residues on food under sections 408and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a,and 348). Food is ``adulterated'' and subject to seizure under the FFDCAif it is found to bear pesticide residues that are not permitted by appropriatesection 408 and 409 tolerances. Section 408 of the FFDCA, like the FIFRA,gives the Agency authority to balance risks and benefits in reaching regulatorydecisions with respect to pesticide residues on raw agricultural commoditiessection 409 of the FFDCA governs the establishment of food additive regulations(often called 409 tolerances) in processed food and feed. EPA interpretssection 409 to also allow EPA to consider benefits to food consumers inreaching its decisions unless the Delaney Clause applies. However, theDelaney Clause of section 409, if read literally, is a risk-only standardthat bars the establishment of any food additive regulation that wouldauthorize residues in or on processed food or feed of any pesticide thathas been found to induce cancer when ingested by man or test animals, withcertain limited exceptions.  The difference in the standards of these two statutes presents EPA witha major problem in regulating certain pesticide chemicals which have beenfound to induce cancer in test animals. Such pesticides may be ineligiblefor food additive regulations under the FFDCA even if they have been foundto pose no unreasonable risk to humans and qualify for registration underFIFRA. This problem may arise in three situations: (1) When a food additiveregulation is sought for a new pesticide chemical (or a new use of a currentlyregistered chemical) that induces cancer in animals; (2) when new residuedata indicate a need for a food additive regulation for a registered pesticideknown to induce cancer in animals; or (3) when new toxicity data show thata registered pesticide for which food additive regulations have been establishedinduces cancer in animals.  In the first situation, the issue is whether to allow the pesticide toenter the market or to be marketed initially for a particular food use.EPA's current regulations prohibit FIFRA registration until the issuanceof any needed tolerances and food additive regulations associated withthe pesticide's use. The second and third situations require EPA to decidewhether to make unlawful the marketing of a pesticide for those previously-approvedfood uses subject to section 409. The number of uses in these latter twocategories is increasing as EPA receives more and more toxicity and residuedata. Of significant concern are the differences in the standards now appliedto old and new pesticides. Under current Agency practice, as describedmore fully later in this Notice, a new pesticide that poses a relativelylow risk of cancer may be barred from registration because of Delaney Clauseconstraints, while an old pesticide that poses a higher risk and that isused for the same purposes might remain on the market.  To address these issues, in February 1985 the Agency commissioned the Boardon Agriculture of the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences(``NAS'') to examine the impact of the Delaney Clause on the tolerance-settingprocess and on EPA decision-making. The NAS committee formed to conductthis study included experts in agricultural pest control, pesticide development,agricultural economics, cancer risk assessment, public health, food science,regulatory decision making, and law.  The detailed report prepared by the NAS, entitled ``Regulating Pesticidesin Food: The Delaney Paradox,'' was issued on May 20, 1987. The reportset forth four main recommendations:1. Pesticide residues in food, whether marketed in raw or processed formor governed by old or new tolerances, should be regulated on the basisof consistent standards. Current law and regulations governing residuesin raw and processed foods are inconsistent with this goal.2. A negligible risk standard for carcinogens in food, applied consistentlyto all pesticides and to all forms of food, could dramatically reduce totaldietary exposure to oncogenic pesticides with modest reduction of benefits.3. EPA should focus its energies on reducing risk from the most worrisomepesticides on the most-consumed crops.4. The EPA should develop improved tools and methods to more systematicallyestimate the overall impact of prospective regulatory actions on health,the environment, and food production.The Agency has evaluated the recommendations of the NAS, and as discussedlater in this document, has reached conclusions about what would be anideal policy, one that would be based on the NAS recommendations. In summaryunder this ideal policy, the Agency would apply a uniform set of criteriato all FIFRA registration decisions and all FFDCA section 408 toleranceand section 409 food additive regulation decisions. If a pesticide's usewould pose no risk or only a negligible risk, the pesticide's use wouldbe approved under both Acts without any particular scrutiny of benefits.This has for some time been EPA's practice with respect to decisions onpesticides that pose only non-cancer risks, and with respect to decisionsunder FIFRA and under FFDCA section 408 on pesticides that may pose cancerrisks. (EPA has assumed that an applicant's willingness to expend the sumsrequired to obtain registration of a pesticide, in the expectation of recoveringthose sums by sales of the pesticide, indicates that the pesticide's usewill yield benefits that are greater than negligible.) Under the idealpolicy, registrations and the associated tolerances and food additive regulationssimilarly would be granted for pesticides that pose at most a negligiblerisk of cancer to humans (and meet the other requirements of FIFRA andthe FFDCA). For those pesticides deemed to pose a greater-than-negligiblerisk, a risk/benefit evaluation would determine the appropriateness ofFIFRA registration and FFDCA clearances under sections 408 and 409. Thegreater the degree of risk, the greater the benefits that would have tobe shown to justify approval, and the more intensive would be the benefitsevaluation required to reach a regulatory decision.Implementation of this ideal policy, however, is subject to the constraintsimposed by the Delaney Clause. In the case of a use of a pesticide thatrequires a section 409 clearance and that poses a cancer risk that is greaterthan negligible, the Delaney Clause ordinarily bars approval of the use;the Agency is unaware of any legal theory that would justify a change inits current practice of refusing to issue new food additive regulationsin such situations (with certain exceptions discussed in detail later inthis Notice). However, for pesticides that pose at most a negligible riskof cancer and whose use requires section 409 clearances, EPA will changeits current practice to the extent that, in the future, EPA will proposeto issue food additive regulations on the basis of the <T3>de minimis </T3>doctrine, described in Unit II of this Notice.The Agency wishes to make it clear that the interpretations and policychanges it is announcing today have no final effect with respect to anyindividual pesticide. This Notice relates primarily to the regulatory treatmentof some pesticides under FFDCA section 409. Any food additive regulationthat EPA may issue in reliance on the <T3>de minimis </T3>doctrine discussed in this Notice will be precededby issuance of a proposed rule, and also will be referred to the FIFRAScientific Advisory Panel. Section 409(b) and 409(h) allow ``any person''to petition EPA to issue, modify, or revoke a section 409 food additiveregulation, and section 409(c) says that EPA must act on such a petition.Under section 409(f), any ``adversely affected person'' (a term that hasbeen given a very inclusive reading by the courts) may object to an EPAaction taken either in response to a section 409(b) petition or at EPA'sown initiative under section 409(d). EPA must rule on the objection; iffactual matters are at issue, EPA first must hold a formal evidentiaryhearing to produce a record upon which the ruling must be based. Althoughthis Notice sets forth positions that the Agency expects to take initiallyin relevant proceedings arising under FFDCA section 409, EPA decisionalofficials will be open to all arguments presented in those proceedingsand will base their final decisions on the merits of the arguments presented.See <T3>McLouth Steel Products Corp. v. Thomas, </T3>838 F. 2d 1317 (D.C. Cir.1988). Judicial review of rulings on individual objections under FFDCAsection 409 is available only in the manner described by section 409(g).EPA will take the position that this Notice is not itself properly thesubject of judicial review because it lacks the requisite finality.A detailed discussion of the policy changes involved is set forth in UnitIII. of this Notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Legal and Regulatory Background</ITAG>EPA often must apply four different and sometimes conflicting statutorystandards in deciding whether a particular pesticide may be used in foodproduction: one under the FIFRA and three under the FFDCA.A. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)The sale, distribution, and use of pesticides in the United States aregoverned directly by the FIFRA and are also influenced heavily by the FFDCA.FIFRA requires that all pesticides which are sold or distributed in theUnited States be registered in accordance with the statutory standard forregistration set forth in FIFRA. That standard requires, among other thing,that the pesticide perform its intended function without causing ``unreasonableadverse effects on the environment.'' (FIFRA section 3(c)(5)). The term``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment'' is defined as ``anyunreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic,social and environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide,''(FIFRA section 2(bb)). Under FIFRA section 6, EPA may cancel the registrationof a use of a pesticide \1\<NOTE/> (or require modifications in the terms and conditions ofregistration in lieu of cancellation) if the Agency determines that therisks of use of the pesticide outweigh the benefits of the use.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The decision to cancel a pesticide can result from a SpecialReview, an intensive review of the risks and benefits of a pesticide whichmeets or exceeds risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR Part 154. The Agencyalso can take action to cancel (and, if necessary, to suspend during thecancellation proceedings) the registration of a pesticide whose risks appearto exceed its benefits, without first going through the Special Reviewprocess.EPA regulations (40 CFR 162.7(d)(2)(iii)(E)) and 162.167(a)(4), redesignatedas 40 CFR 152.112, 152.113, and 152.114, see 53 FR 15952, May 4, 1988)provide that a registration may not be granted if ``the intended use ofthe pesticide results or may reasonably be expected to result, directlyor indirectly, in residues of the pesticide becoming a component of foodor feed,'' unless the necessary sections 408 and 409 clearances have beenissued.This requirement assures that a pesticide use will not be registered fora food crop unless the Agency has determined that the resulting pesticideresidues in or on the crop will not exceed a safe level. Moreover, by examiningthe pesticide use under the statutory scheme as a whole and assuring thatthe criteria of both FIFRA and FFDCA are met, the Agency avoids the potentialfor residues that are illegal under the FFDCA appearing in or on foodsas a result of pesticide use that is legal under FIFRA. It has been EPA'sbelief that pesticide users and food processors should be able to safelyassume that a pesticide registered under FIFRA has the appropriate clearancesunder the FFDCA for the food uses listed on the FIFRA label. B. Sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)Under FFDCA section 402, a raw agricultural commodity is adulterated ifit contains a pesticide residue not authorized by a FFDCA section 408 tolerance(maximum permissible level) or an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.An adulterated commodity sold or distributed in interstate commerce issubject to seizure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\Under Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, which establishedEPA, the authority to set tolerances for pesticide chemicals in raw agriculturalcommodities and processed food under FFDCA sections 408 and 409 respectively,was transferred from FDA to EPA. FDA enforces most of the pesticide tolerancesand food additive regulations that EPA issues, along with the many non-pesticidefood additive regulations that FDA issues. The U.S. Department of Agricultureenforces the tolerances and food additive regulations with respect to meat,poultry, and egg products. To establish a tolerance or exemption regulation under section 408, theAgency must find that the regulation would ``protect the public health.''(FFDCA section 408(b)). In reaching this determination, the Agency is directedto consider, among ``other relevant factors,'' the necessity for the productionof an adequate, wholesome, and economical food supply, and the other waysin which the consumer may be affected by the pesticide. Thus, in the Agency'sview, section 408 of the FFDCA expressly gives the Agency the authorityto balance risks against benefits in determining appropriate tolerancelevels. Under FFDCA section 402, food is adulterated (and hence subject to seizure)if it contains any food additive (including any pesticide residue) notauthorized by a section 409 food additive regulation. An important exceptionto this provision is that a processed food containing pesticide residuesresulting from the ``carryover'' from treatment at the raw agriculturalcommodity stage is not regarded as adulterated if the residue level insuch a food is no greater than that allowed by the section 408 toleranceestablished for the raw agricultural commodity. The establishement of a food additive regulation under section 409 requiresa finding under the ``general safety clause'' in section 409(c)(3) thatthe use of the pesticide ``will be safe.'' The only direct guidance givenby the Act as to the meaning of the term ``safe'' is that the term ``hasreference to the health of man or animal,'' (FFDCA section 201(u)). Factorsto be considered in making this ``general safety clause'' determinationare (1) the probable consumption of the pesticide or its metabolites; (2)the cumulative effect of the pesticide in the diet of man or animals, takinginto account any related substances in the diet; (3) appropriate safetyfactors to relate the animal data to the human risk evaluation; and (4)``other relevant factors.'' FFDCA Section 409(c)(5)). Appendix A contains a discussion of the procedures followed by the Agencyin evaluating safe residue levels for tolerances and food additive regulations.The general safety clause in section 409(c)(3) has been construed by theAgency to allow the weighing of benefits and risks when issuing food additiveregulations. The legislative history indicates that section 409 was intendedto permit the use of food additives ``which may benefit our people andour economy when the proposed usages of such additives are in amounts accepted* * * as safe,'' and that ``the test which should determine whether ornot a particular additive may be used in a specific percentage of relationshipof the volume of the product to which it might be added should be thatof reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the additiveis not harmful to man or animal.'' (S. Rep. No. 2422, 85th Cong. 2d Sess.,August 18, 1958, at 2-3). In EPA's view, the determination of whether useof a pesticidal food additive is ``not harmful'' or is ``safe'' shouldtake into account the net effects of use of the additive on the food supply,including the benefit (or to put it another way the avoidance of harm)to an adequate, wholesome, and economical supply of food that may resultfrom a pesticide's use as well as any harm to the food supply that mayresult from the pesticide's use. At least for residues of pesticide chemicals,EPA believes that this kind of benefit should be regarded as one of the``relevant factors'' EPA may consider under FFDCA section 409(c)(5), eventhough it is not listed specifically there as it is in section 408(b).A risk/benefit reading of the general safety clause also was adopted bythe one court that has addressed the issue.\3\<NOTE/> FDA, however, has tended to interpret the section 409 generalsafety clause as a criterion that focuses solely on the risks to the foodsupply caused by the food additive, as opposed to the risks avoided, andthis view has considerable support in the legislative history of section409 and in scholarly journals. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\In <T3>Continental Chemiste Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Ruckelshaus, </T3>461 F.2d 331, 340-341 (7th Cir. 1972), a case dealingwith the relationship of FIFRA and FFDCA, the court stated that ``[t]hetest of safety [contained in the general safety clause of section 409]was intended to take into account the broader concepts of safety underthe intended conditions of use; the benefits of the additive were to beevaluated rather than merely its potential for harm. In short, in makingits ultimate determination whether new additives, or food containing them,may be marketed, [the FFDCA] employs the kind of substantive standard ofproduct safety embodied in [the pre-1972] FIFRA's injury to man' concept,rather than a narrow consideration of the character of the additive itself.''In discussing this ``injury to man'' concept, the court noted that ``thesubstantive standards, phrased in terms of protection of the public andimpact on living man, require consideration of the aggregate effect ofa product's use upon the environment, including not only its potentialfor harm, but also the benefits which would be lost by removing it fromthe market.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 336.   C. The Delaney ClauseThe one clear exception to the Agency's latitude to balance risks and benefitsfor food additives under section 409 is the ``Delaney Clause'' in section409(c)(3). The Delaney Clause states that a food additive shall not bedeemed safe ``if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animalor if it is found, after tests which are appropriate for the evaluationof the safety of food additives, to induce cancer in man or animal.'' BecauseFFDCA section 408 contains no counterpart to the Delaney Clause, the Agencyhas the authority to evaluate the risk posed by the presence of residuesof a carcinogenic pesticide in a raw agricultural commodity, and to establisha section 408 tolerance at a level which will protect the public health,taking benefits to the food supply into account. As long as the processedfood does not contain residues above the level allowed in the raw agriculturalcommodity, residues of that carcinogenic pesticide may legally be presentin such processed food. However, where residues of the chemical concentrateabove the section 408 tolerance level during processing, or result fromuse of a pesticide during or after processing, a food additive regulationmight not be appropriate because of the Delaney Clause bar. The DelaneyClause contains an express exception (the ``DES provisio'') that allowsa carcinogenic ingredient of animal feed to be found ``safe'' if such ingredientwill not adversely affect the animal and if ``no residue'' of the substancewill be found, by an Agency-approved method, in any edible food yieldedor derived from the treated animal. FDA has concluded that the provisionshould be implemented by a ``sensitivity-of-method'' approach that allowsa carcinogenic ingredient to be added to animal feed if ``no residues''of that ingredient are detectable by an FDA-approved analytical methodthat is sensitive enough to detect any level of residue representing alifetime excess human cancer risk of more than one in a million (44 FR17070).\4\<NOTE/> The FDA approach incorporates a series of conservative assumptionsfor calculating the allowable residue levels in individual food items andin the total diet.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ FDA has analyzed the meaning of the DES proviso in proposedregulations published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 20, 1979 (44 FR 17070), and February11, 1983 (48 FR 6361). FDA's final rule establishing procedures implementingthis sensitivity-of-method approach was published on December 31, 1987(52 FR 49572).EPA has used the sensitivity-of-method approach in two actions establishingfood additive regulations, one concerning thiodicarb and its possibly oncogenicmetabolite acetamide on the animal feeds cottonseed hulls and soybean hulls(50 FR 27452, July 3, 1985; 50 FR 41341, October 10, 1985), and anotherconcerning cyromazine and its possibly oncogenic metabolite melamine inor on poultry feed (49 FR 18120, April 27, 1984; 50 FR 20370, May 15, 1985).If the chemcial induced cancer in animal studies in which the route ofexposure was other than ingestion, the Delaney Clause by its own termsapplies only if the tests in question ``are appropriate for the evaluationof the safety of food additives.'' The Agency thus has discretion to decidewhether a test showing cancer induction as a result of, e.g., dermal exposureto a chemical is ``appropriate'' for Delaney Clause purposes.Two administratives doctrines, the ``constituents policy'' and the <T3>de minimis </T3>approach, also in EPA's view allow the establishmentof food additive regulations in appropriate situations. The ``consituentspolicy,'' developed by FDA, relies on the fact that the prohibitory languageof the Delaney Clause pertains to any food additive, that has been shownto induce cancer in animals, but does not bar approval where an unwantedimpurity (a ``constituent'') of the additive, tested by itself, is foundto induce cancer. Thus, under the constituents policy, a food additiveregulation may be established if the food additive as a whole does notcause cancer, even though the additive contains an undesired, nonfunctionalconstituent which is itself a carcinogen. In this situation, the impurityis judged under the general safety provisions of the applicable sectionof the FFDCA, using risk assessment as one of the decision-making tools.The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld FDA's use of the constituentspolicy to interpret the color additives Delaney Clause provision in section706(b)(5)(B) of the statute. (<T3>Scott v. FDA, </T3>728 F. 2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)). This provision containsa prohibition closely similar to that found in the section 409 DelaneyClause.EPA has used the constituents policy in a rulemaking establishing a foodadditive regulation for dicamba in sugarcane molasses. Dicamba itself isnot thought to be oncogenic; however, the pesticide formulation containssmall amounts of a carcinogenic nitrosamine contaminant. EPA found thepotential risk attributable to the presence of this contaminant to be verysmall, i.e., with an upper limit in the 10^9 range. Accordingly, the agencyconcluded that the requirements of section 409 were satisfied. (48 FR 11119,March 16, 1983; 48 FR 34024, July 27, 1983; 48 FR 50528, November 2, 1983).In discussing its use of the ``constituents policy'' approach for dicamba,EPA noted that it does not regard deliberately added active or inert ingredients,or metabolites thereof, as potential candidates for clearance under theconstituents policy. Rather, the Agency said it would only consider applyingthe rationale to unwanted impurities resulting from the manufacture ofthe pesticide (intermediates, residual reactants, products of side reactions,and chemical degradates). Furthermore, the Agency said that it would considerusing this rationale in issuing a food additive regulation only where thepotential risk from the impurity is extremely low, and that in estimatingthis risk, the Agency would rely on very conservative risk estimation methodology.(48 FR 34024, July 27, 1983).Finally, the <T3>de minimis</T3> approach derives from case law holding that an administrativeagency ordinarily has the inherent authority to avoid applying the termsof a statute literally when to do so would yield pointless results.\5\<NOTE/> Two conditions are necessary to allow an agency to invokethe <T3>de minimis </T3>doctrine. First, the problem that would be addressedby regulation must be trivial in fact, such that no real benefit wouldresult from regulation. Second, the legislative design must allow the Agencynot to apply the statute literally in such a case.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See <T3>Alabama Power Co. </T3>v. <T3>Costle,</T3> 636 F.2d 323, 360 (D.C. Cir. 1979); <T3>District of Columbia </T3>v. <T3>Orleans,</T3> 406 F.2d 957, 959 (D.C. Cir. 1968); <T3>Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>636 F.2d 1267, 1284 n. 46 (D.C. Cir. 1980).In a recent case addressing the Delaney Clause contained in the color additiveprovisions of the FFDCA enacted in 1960 <T3>(Public Citizen </T3>v. <T3>Young,</T3> 831 F.2nd 1108 (D.C. Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 108 S.Ct.1470), FDA argued that the establishment of a <T3>de minimis</T3> exception to the Delaney Clause is consistent withthe legislative design, and that conservatively-assessed risks of one ina million (10 ^\6\) or less should be regarded as trivial and thus subjectto the exception. FDA relied on legislative history indicating that theDelaney Clause should be applied in a reasonable way. But the court rejectedFDA's argument that the legislative history of the FFDCA color additiveprovisions does not preclude the use of the <T3>de minimis</T3> exception. The court held that ``the Delaney Clauseof the Color Additive Amendments does not contain an implicit <T3>de minimis </T3>exception for carcinogenic dyes with trivial risksto humans'' because ``Congress adopted an `extraordinarily rigid' position,denying the FDA authority to list a dye once it found it to `induce cancerin * * * animals'.'' (831 F.2nd at 1122). In the court's view, the propermechanism for obtaining relief from the Delaney Clause with respect tocolor additives whose risk is trivial is to request that Congress makeappropriate modifications to the statute. The food additive Delaney Clausein section 409, adopted in 1958, was not at issue in the case. Indeed,the court noted that the context of the section 409 provision was entirelydifferent from that of the color additive Delaney Clause, and that ``theoperation of the food additive Delaney Clause raises complex issues distinctfrom those of this appeal'' (id. at 1120, 1118 n. 13). The court suggested,moreover, that the legislative history of the section 409 Delaney Clausemight lead to a different result (id. at 1120).The Delaney Clause has long been regarded as allowing the administeringagency to exercise scientific judgment and discretion in deciding whethera food additive ``induces cancer'' in animals.\6\<NOTE/> EPA has generally assumed that, for purposes of the DelaneyClause, a substance ``induces cancer'' in animals if, in a well-conductedanimal feeding study, a statistically significant increase in the incidenceof histologically related tumors (benign, malignant, or combined) is observedin treated animals compared to concurrent control animals, unless thereis a reason to conclude that the observed increase is unrelated to theingestion of the test substance. Under this approach, a pesticide may befound to ``induce cancer'' in animals despite the fact that increased tumorincidence occurs only at high doses, or that only benign tumors occur,and despite negative results in other animal feeding studies. FDA has takena similar approach in assessing data for the purposes of the Delaney Clause.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ See, e.g., the 1960 statement by Arthur S. Fleming, Secretaryof Health, Education and Welfare, that the Delaney Clause ``allows theDepartment and its scientific people full discretion and judgment in decidingwhether a substance has been shown to produce cancer when added to thediet of test animals,'' cited with approval in the Report of the HouseCommittee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on the Color Additive Amendmentsof 1960 (H.R. Rep. No. 1761, 85th Cong. 2d Sess., June 7, 1960) at 14.See also the May 1960 report of the President's Science Advisory Committee,noting that ``[t]he definition of a carcinogen implicit in the languageof section 409(c) requires discretion in its interpretation because somay variables enter into a judgment as to whether a particular substanceis or is not carcinogenic,'' cited with approval in the Senate floor debateon reconsideration of the Delaney Clause in the Color Additive Amendmentsof 1960. Congressional Record 15380 (July 1, 1960).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ See 52 FR 49572, 49577 (December 31, 1987) for a statementof FDA's current policy. See also 51 FR 28331, 28340 (August 7, 1986),where FDA specifically noted that ``any chemical shown to induce cancereven in only one strain, gender, and species, at one dose in one experiment,is an animal carcinogen.'' The evidence as a whole may lead FDA to concludethat a substance that only causes benign tumors should be regulated asa carcinogen under the Delaney Clause. (52 FR 49577, December 31, 1987).However, a finding of only benign tumors does not of necessity lead FDAto conclude that the chemical ``induces cancer'' under the Delaney Clause.There is at least ``limited evidence'' of carcinogenicity (virtually allfrom animal studies) for 66 or more of the approximately 350 food-use pesticidesalready approved for use, under the classification scheme set forth inEPA's ``Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment,'' (51 FR 33992, September24, 1986), described in Appendix A. EPA expects this number to become somewhatlarger as it receives and evaluates more studies on the food-use pesticides.\8\<NOTE/> A substantial portion of these pesticides require section409 food additive regulations for one or more of their uses. Appendix Blists those pesticides which currently have been identified by the Agencyas potential carcinogens and indicates which ones have, or have recentlybeen determined to need, section 409 food additive regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ In recent years, the Agency has been conducting a systematicreview of currently registered pesticides under the Registration Standardsprocess. This review determines the sufficiency of the data base for thesechemicals in light of current data requirements, and evaluates the currentterms of registration to see if modifications are appropriate. During thedevelopment of a Standard, data gaps are identified and data call-in noticessent to registrants pursuant to FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B), which gives theAgency authority to require the submission of data necessary to supportexisting registrations. The Agency evaluates the adequacy of existing tolerancesand food additive regulations for chemicals registered for food uses duringthe Registration Standard review. Appendix C lists those food use pesticidesfor which Registration Standards have been developed or are scheduled forFY 1988.D. Current Policy Has Been Constrained by the Delaney ClauseFrom the foregoing discussion, it is apparent that if EPA determines thata pesticide poses a cancer risk that is greater than negligible and thatoutweighs the pesticide's benefits, the pesticide's FIFRA registrationshould be cancelled and its FFDCA sections 408 and 409 clearances shouldbe revoked. There is no conflict between the various standards in sucha case, and EPA's current practice reflects this lack of conflict.Difficulties arise in the two remaining situations. A pesticide may poseonly a negligible cancer risk, or it may pose a cancer risk that is greaterthan negligible but nonetheless is not so great as to outweigh the pesticide'sbenefits to the food supply. In both of the latter situations, EPA viewsFIFRA, FFDCA section 408, and FFDCA section 409's general safety clauseas allowing the registration or continued registration of the pesticideand the issuance or continuation of needed FFDCA clearances. But the DelaneyClause of FFDCA section 409 arguably bars the issuance of new section 409clearances for pesticides in either of the latter two situations, and thusconcomitantly calls into question the status of such pesticides under FFDCAsection 408 and FIFRA. Due to the constraints dictated by the literal approachto the Delaney Clause, the Agency has not been willing to register a carcinogenicpesticide for a new food use which requires a section 409 food additiveregulation, even though that pesticide meets the risk/benefit standardsin the other statutory provisions. And since there is often no practicalway to assure that the raw agricultural commodity at issue will not beprocessed, the Agency generally does not grant a section 408 tolerancefor residues of the pesticide on a raw agricultural commodity in a situationwhere an associated section 409 food additive regulation is needed butcannot be issued. As noted earlier, EPA's regulations currently providethat before a pesticide may be registered under FIFRA for a food or feeduse, there must exist appropriate clearances under FFDCA sections 408 and409 for the pesticide residues.However, if the pesticide is to be used on a type of raw agricultural commoditywhich is not processed or if concentration of the raw-commodity residuesdoes not occur during processing, and if the pesticides is not added duringor after processing, no food additive regulation is needed. If the pesticideuse passes the risk/benefit test under FIFRA and FFDCA section 408, a registrationcan be granted. This is true even if the estimated dietary cancer riskto the public is the same as or higher than the risk posed by an analogouspesticide use for which a food additive regulation is required. Thus, verysimilar risk situations have been treated quite differently because ofthe inconsistent statutory provisions. This approach has not necessarilyresulted in lower health risks for the public. In fact, there is a strongargument that in some cases the constraints of the Delaney Clause paradoxicallymay have led to greater risks to the public. New pesticides that pose lowercancer risks than pesticides currently on the market have been denied registrationwhile older, more hazardous pesticides remained in use.The Agency's treatment of established food additive regulations for registeredpesticide chemicals shown by new data to induce cancer in test animalshas been quite different than the just-described treatment of requestsfor new food additive regulations. To date, the Agency has not taken actionbased on the Delaney Clause to revoke established food additive regulations.In many instances, taking such action would require EPA either to revokethe associated 408 tolerances and cancel the FIFRA registration (despitethe risk/benefit criteria that would govern such actions), or to abandonits long-standing policy that the lawful application of a pesticide shouldnot result in illegal pesticide residues. Many of these pesticides appearto pose low or negligible risks and to have substantial benefits for theproduction of food in this country.The Agency has deferred action in such cases, while studying the dilemmaposed by the statutory scheme. Section 409(h), which authorizes EPA toissue regulations establishing procedures for amending or repealing foodadditive regulations, does not expressly require repeal of food additiveregulations when new data indicate that the pesticide induces cancer.\9\<NOTE/> The Agency arguably has the latitude to assess the safetyof established food additive regulations under any standard it choosesto adopt that is not arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of theAdministrative Procedure Act; it arguably could adopt a standard basedon the general safety clause of section 409(c)(3), or on a non-FFDCA standard,such as the FIFRA risk/benefit standard. Thus, the Agency could concludethat a previously-approved use of a pesticide is ``safe'' or not ``unreasonable,''even though the potential risk is greater than ``negligible,'' if the benefitsof the use to the food supply outweigh its risks. On the other hand, ifthe Agency concluded that the presence of residues in the processed foodor feed posed a risk that is ``unreasonable'' within the meaning of FIFRAor not ``safe'' within the meaning of the general safety clause of FFDCAsection 409, considering the balance of risks and benefits, the Agencywould be under an obligation to take action to repeal the regulation (or,in appropriate situations, to amend the regulation to allow a lower residuelevel determined to be ``safe'' or ``reasonable'') and to cancel or modifythe terms and conditions of the related FIFRA registration as necessaryto assure that the use of the pesticide did not cause unreasonable adverseeffects on the environment. This approach would allow EPA to reconcilethe FIFRA and FFDCA standards.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Section 409(h) states: ``[The Administrator] shall byregulation prescribe the procedure by which regulations under (section409) shall be amended or repealed, and such procedure shall conform tothe procedure provided in this section for the promulgation of such regulation.''The interpretation that revocation is not expressly required is based ongiving the term ``procedure'' its normal meaning, rather than reading intothe term the substantive criteria of section 409.The contrary argument would rest on the assumption that Congress must haveintended any reevaluation of an existing food additive regulation to bebased on the section 409(c) criteria for establishing new regulations,and that the Delaney Clause is an integral part of section 409(c). Thisview of section 409 thus would incorporate section 409(c)_including theDelaney Clause_into section 409(h) of the statute. Under this reading,a food additive regulation would have to be revoked if new informationshould indicate that the Delaney Clause would have barred issuance of theregulation had that information been available originally.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ FDA appears to interpret the Delaney Clause as applyingto food additives established prior to any indication of carcinogenic effectfor such chemicals. See, for example, the discussion in the proposed FDAdetermination not to ban the use of methylene chloride in decaffeinatedcoffee (50 FR 51551, 51555 December 18, 1985).Such an approach might result in the cancellation of pesticide registrationsfor uses that meet the risk/benefit standard of FIFRA, FFDCA section 408,and FFDCA section 409's general safety clause, but that cannot conformto the risk-only, zero-risk standard of the Delaney Clause. Once the foodadditive regulation had been repealed, the presence of residues of thatpesticide in the processed food in question would be illegal under theFFDCA, and the wisdom of allowing the pesticide to be sold under the FIFRAregistration for use in producing that food would be questionable. To beconsistent, many related section 408 tolerances also would have to be repealedunder this approach, because such tolerances arguably would be inappropriatewhere residues could concentrate during processing to an unapproved levelhigher than the tolerance for the raw agricultural commodity. This approach,carried to its logical conclusion, might end many valuable uses of pesticidechemicals and might result in significant adverse consequences to foodproduction, while resulting in little or no risk reduction. It should benoted that a registrant of a pesticide faced with a proposed FIFRA cancellationbased entirely or primarily on the fact that the pesticide's residues arenot thought to be ``safe'' within the meaning of FFDCA section 409 mightassert that a FIFRA cancellation cannot be based on criteria imported fromthe FFDCA, and might succeed (see <T3>Continental Chemists Corp</T3>.v. <T3>Ruckelshaus</T3>, 461 F. 2d 331 (1972)). If the approach describedin this paragraph were successful, however, there again would be no dichotomyin the treatment of old and new pesticides.The system that has been used by EPA so far has the added undesirable featureof placing new pesticides that are barred from registration because ofthe strict reading of the Delaney Clause at a disadvantage relative toold products that are shown by new data to pose comparable or higher risks.Given the high costs of data development, there is little incentive todevelop a new food use pesticide that shows carcinogenic potential_evenif the risk it would pose would be minimal, and even if it could replacean old product that poses a higher risk_if initial registration is likelyto be barred by Delaney Clause considerations. Thus, the development ofnew, lower-risk chemicals to replace old, higher-risk pesticides may havebeen retarded by the Agency's past implementation of the Delaney Clause.A reassessment of the data in support of the tolerances for a particularpesticide chemical may present another serious concern. The data reviewby the Agency may reveal, with respect to a chemical that induces cancerin animal studies, that not all the necessary section 409 tolerances arein place. New residue data or a new review of old data may lead the Agencyto determine that residues concentrate during processing and that section409 food additive regulations have not been promulgated to cover this situation.If the Agency cannot promulgate such regulations because of the DelaneyClause ban, these processed commodities would contain illegal residuesand would be subject to seizure by FDA. To prevent the presence of theseresidues in the processed commodities, the Agency would have to attemptto revoke the corresponding FIFRA registrations and FFDCA section 408 tolerances(unless appropriate use restrictions on the pesticide labeling could bedeveloped to prevent the use of the pesticide on commodities destined forprocessing). Such action could profoundly limit the use of many beneficialpesticide chemicals.The Agency is facing the issues discussed here with an ever-increasingnumber of old pesticide chemicals. (Appendix D discusses certain examplesof pesticide chemicals currently or recently under review which give anoverview of the practical dimensions of the problem.) EPA's decision onwhether to attempt to apply the section 409(c) criteria retrospectivelyunder section 409(h) may depend on whether its approach to negligible-risksituations, set forth in unit III of this document, is upheld.E. Potential for Legislative SolutionThe administrative approaches discussed so far in this document would solveonly some of the problems the Agency faces in this area. Moreover, implementingthose approaches will be controversial and might involve the Agency inprotracted litigation that could cause uncertainty and make it difficultfor businesses to make plans about pesticide development and pesticideuse. A legislative solution, stating clearly that the Agency has the authorityto grant food additive regulations for pesticide residues posing at mosta negligible risk, clearly would be desirable. Additional legislative changeswould be required to allow the Agency to fully reconcile FFDCA and FIFRA.Such legislation ideally would give the EPA the latitude to establish tolerancesand food additive regulations for pesticides under a risk/benefit standardcompatible with FIFRA, with a definitive statement that clearances forboth raw and processed foods are to be established under a risk/benefitapproach.Hearings have been held recently in the House of Representatives on twobills that would address these issues. H.R. 4739, introduced by CongressmanWaxman, would provide for the regulation of pesticide residues exclusivelyunder comprehensively rewritten FFDCA section 408; H.R. 4937, introducedby Congressmen Brown and Roberts, would also provide for regulating pesticideresidues under section 408, but would make only minor changes in the substanceof that section.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Response to First and Second NAS Recommendations</ITAG>A. IntroductionThe Agency agrees completely with the NAS Report's most important conclusion_thata consistent approach ideally should be followed in the regulation of pesticidesfor food uses, regardless of whether the pesticides are new or old or whetherthe foods are raw or processed. As the NAS Report points out, there isno scientific reason to regulate pesticide residues in raw commoditiesdifferently from those in processed commodities. For risk assessment purposes,what is critical is not the type of food or feed commodity on which residuesare present, but rather the identity and magnitude of the residues in thefood and the associated consumption pattern. Likewise, EPA agrees withNAS that pesticides should be regulated consistently whether they are newlydeveloped or have been on the market for many years.Use of regulatory criteria that reflected those two NAS recommendationswould allow the Agency to regulate high-risk pesticides more stringentlythan those that pose low risks, and permit the registration of new pesticidesthat offer substantial benefits and pose relatively insignificant risks.Riskier pesticides could then be replaced, and the total dietary risk reduced,with only minor adverse impacts on food production. This approach wouldbe eminently sensible and desirable.B. Policy for Achieving Greater Consistency in Evaluating Pesticides UnderFIFRA and the FFDCAThe Agency believes that the most desirable way to achieve consistencyin regulating potentially carcinogenic food-use pesticides would be toevaluate them under the same risk/benefit standard for both registrationand tolerance purposes. However, if a section 409 regulation is requiredfor a chemical to which the Delaney Clause applies, EPA believes that currentlaw allows this approach to be used only to the extent that the <T3>de minimis</T3> doctrine allows Delaney Clause considerations to bedismissed. The following Table I outlines the regulatory outcomes thatEPA would propose in response to various types of findings with respectto the cancer risk posed by new chemicals (or new uses of old chemicals).For clarity, Table I ignores non-cancer risks, and also ignores non-dietarycancer risks; in practice EPA would of course consider all risks.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Discussions in this document of risks resulting frompesticide use are limited to cancer risks due to dietary exposure. It isimportant for the reader to keep in mind that the Agency's reviews anddecisions encompass many other risks as well. Table I proceeds from theassumption that all other risk criteria have been satisfied.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3388-3-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 3 454</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG>The following sections discuss how the new approach will affect pesticidesin various regulatory categories. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Pesticides That Have no Carcinogenic Effect or That Pose Only aNegligible Risk of Carcinogenicity</ITAG>For pesticides that are the subjects of applications for intitial registrationor for registration for new uses, and that either do not induce cancerin test animals or pose only a negligible human cancer risk (generallya quantitative risk of 10 ^\6\ or less), EPA will propose to establishsection 408 tolerances and section 409 food additive regulations, wherenecessary, and thereafter to approve the applications for registration.Very little scrutiny will be given to the benefits of such non-carcinogenicor negligible-risk pesticides. As it has in the past, the Agency will assumethe presence of benefits that outweigh the negligible risk. A list of pesticidesthat are potential candidates for consideration under the negligible-riskapproach is provided in Appendix E. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Pesticides That Pose a Caracinogenic Risk That Is Greater ThanNegligible</ITAG>Some pesticides may pose a risk of carcinogenicity that is greater thannegligible. Generally, such pesticides will be those with quantified upper-boundrisks greater than 10^\6\. (Some pesticides with quantified upper-boundrisks greater than 10^\6\ may, however, fall into the negligible risk categoryfor qualitative reasons, as discussed in Unit III.B.3.) For pesticide usesnot requiring FFDCA section 409 clearances, EPA will continue its currentpractice of granting FIFRA registrations and the associated FFDCA section408 tolerances for pesticides whose carcinogenic risk is greater than negligibleonly if the benefits are determined to outweigh the risks based on a carefulscrutiny of the projected benefits compared to other available means ofpest control. Benefits evaluations will be performed for such pesticides;the higher the risk, the more thorough the benefits evaluation that willbe necessary. The risks of the available alternative pesticides will alsobe taken into account to determine if the total risk picture could be reducedby allowing the pesticide on the market. This approach accords with pastpractice. But for the Delaney Clause, the Agency would propose to apply the sameapproach to pesticides in this category that require section 409 regulations.However, the Agency is not aware of any legal theory that would allow useof this approach under section 409 as it is currently written. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Treatment of Group C Chemicals</ITAG>As explained in the EPA Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment, (51FR 33992, September 24, 1986), there is great variability from one chemicalto another in the amount and persuasiveness of evidence tending to showwhether or not a chemical may cause cancer in humans. The EPA Guidelinesrepresent the Agency's scheme for categorizing chemicals in terms of theweight of the evidence relating to their potential for human carcinogenicity.In general, the approach of the Guidelines is (1) to place a chemical inone of the groups (A through E) on the basis of the strength of the qualitativeevidence of carcinogenicity from human epidemiology studies and animaltests and (2) for those chemicals showing some evidence of carcinogenicity,to set forth separately a quantitative upper bound on the risk that wouldbe posed to humans if the substance in fact were a human carcinogen (seeAppendix A). This information is useful to Agency officials and the public,since it provides a way to compare the risks of chemicals and to determinehow consistently chemicals are regulated under the several statutory programsadministered by the Agency.The chemicals that pose the greatest difficulty in determining the properregulatory response generally are those that fall into Group C (``possiblehuman carcinogens'') under the Guidelines. A chemical is placed in GroupC if there is some evidence of potential carcinogenicity from animal studies,but that evidence is so limited that the chemical cannot be assigned toa higher category.The Guidelines state that is some cases the Agency will not calculate aquantitative risk ceiling for a Group C chemical. Although it is alwayspossible to calculate a quantitative risk number, the Agency believes thatin some cases such quantitative estimates may suggest that the chemicaldefinitely poses a risk to humans, even though in fact the Agency is quiteunsure whether the chemical poses human risk. Appendix F lists a numberof Group C pesticides and states whether quantitation of risk was deemedappropriate for each. The Delaney Clause, of course, makes no provision for the weighing of animal-testevidence in terms of its pertience to human risk. If a chemical is foundto induce cancer when ingested by animals or in other appropriate tests,the chemical is deemed ``unsafe'' under section 409 (unless the <T3>de minimis</T3> doctrine or one of the other previously-discussed exceptionsapplies). This absolute criterion presents special difficulties with respectto Group C pesticides.The Agency's treatment for Delaney Clause purposes of a pesticide thatfalls in Group C will very. For example, many chemicals fall into GroupC merely because the evidence of carcinogenicity comes from only one study.When the evidence from that study clearly indicates a carcinogenic effectin the animal tested, the Agency ordinarily treats the chemical as fallingwithin the ``high'' end of the C category range and quantifies the risk.A tolerance decision for such a chemical will be based on the quantitativerisk number, and the Delaney Clause will be deemed to apply unless thequantitative upper bound risk level is so low that the chemical's riskmay be ignored under the <T3>de minimis</T3> doctrine. Conversely, a pesticide may be classifiedin Group C because the data on whether the chemical is an animal carcinogenare limited or uncertain, e.g., if the data are equivocal, unreliable,or subject to significant doubt, or if only benign tumors occurred. Ifthe Agency determines that the weight of the evidence does not supporttreating the chemical as an animal carcinogen, the Agency will not treatthe chemical as falling within the Delaney Clause bar. The Agency will,of course, in any such determination, set forth the reasons for its judgment.For example, a pesticide may be classified as belonging in Group C becausethe pesticide is associated with an increase in tumors in only one sexof one species with a lack of a clear dose/reponse relationship. Assumingthat mutagenic data are negative and that structure/activity analysis showsno association with known carcinogens, the Agency generally would considersuch a pesticide to be at the ``low'' end of the Group C range. It is doubtfulthat the Agency would require a quantification of the carcinogenic risk,and in such a case, the Delaney Clause would not be deemed applicable.A pesticide may also fall into Group C, not because of any doubt aboutwhether the chemical induces cancer in certain animal tests, but becauseof uncertainties as to the relevance of the finding to human risk. Reasonsfor questioning the relevance of the animal data to human risk could include,among other things, know variations in response between the test speciesand humans, or mechanistic considerations, e.g., a showing that cancerwas induced in animals only as a secondly effect of an organic change inthe animals induced by very high doses of the chemical and a showing thatthis effect would not occur at the low levels of human exposure. If a convincingexplanation exists for why the chemical poses no risk of cancer for humans,despite the fact that it has been shown to be an animal carcinogen in afeeding study or other appropriate study and has a theoretical upper boundrisk greater than 10^\6\ calculated using a no-threshold model, EPA wouldpropose to treat the chemical as falling into the negligible risk or <T3>de minimis</T3> category for Delaney Clause purposes because of thequalitative reasons for discounting the animal test results as a predictorof human risk. Given the limited knowledge about interspecies responsedifferences and mechanisms of action for cancer, EPA anticipates that veryfew pesticides would qualify for <T3>de minimis</T3> treatment on this qualitative basis in the near future.A Group C carcinogen would be regarded as subject to the Delaney Clauseif it did not fall into the quantitative or qualitative <T3>de minimis</T3> exception described in this Notice. The following Table II summarizes the Agency's proposed treatment of GroupC carcinogens:<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 3 461</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3388-3-C</ITAG>If the Agency determines that the Delaney Clause does not apply to a pesticidedespite limited evidence of the pesticide's oncogenicity, the Agency willexamine all toxicological effects of possible concern in determining thelimit of acceptable dietary exposure. The Agency will then determine theno-observed-effect level (NOEL) for the most sensitive effect, which inturn will be used in setting the allowable daily intake (ADI) used in calculatingthe maximum permissible level of residues. (See Appendix A of this document.) <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Currently Registered Pesticides  </ITAG>EPA's position with respect to currently registered pesticides that poseat most a negligible dietary risk of cancer will parallel that describedearlier for proposed new food uses of pesticides, and the regulatory statusof registered pesticides that pose such risks will not be changed as aresult of this Notice. At the other end of the spectrum, EPA is not changingits policy of attempting to cancel FIFRA registrations and revoke FFDCAclearances for pesticides that pose risks of cancer (or other adverse effects)that outweigh their benefits. Finally, EPA has not determined how to proceedwith respect to a pesticide that poses an upper-bound cancer risk thatis greater than negligible but that is outweighed by the benefits of thepesticide.  <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Section 18 Exemptions  </ITAG>Section 18 of FIFRA allows EPA to exempt State and Federal agencies fromthe provisions of the Act if the Agency finds that emergency conditionsexist that warrant the exemption. The changes in the Agency's approachto the issuance of food additive regulations already described in thisdocument would result in conforming changes in the implementation of theemergency exemption program. The Agency will apply the negligible riskstandard in evaluating emergency exemption requests in a manner similarto other regulatory decisions concerning pesticides which are carcinogens.If associated dietary risks are greater than negligible, the Agency wouldconsider granting the exemption only if the benefits are so great thatthey outweigh the risks. In this connection, EPA considers, among otherthings, whether use of the unregistered pesticide would present a lowerdietary risk than currently registered alternatives.  Generally, an emergency exemption will not be granted if adequate progressis not being made toward full registration of the pesticide use. In therecent past, the Agency has treated the need for a section 409 toleranceas an automatic bar to a request for an exemption to allow emergency useof a substance that has been found to induce cancer in appropriate animalstudies, on the assumption that no section 409 clearance could be issuedand accordingly there would be no possibility of registration. In the future,however, the Agency will not consider the need for a 409 tolerance, <T3>per se, </T3>as blocking progress toward registration of such a pesticide.Rather it would consider whether it is likely the pesticide may subsequentlybe registered according to the policies outlined in this document.  <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Minor Uses</ITAG>FIFRA directs the Agency to make the registration process more flexiblefor minor use pesticides. Use of the approaches set forth in this Noticeshould favor minor uses because they ordinarily involve lower exposuresthan uses of chemicals on major crops such as wheat or corn.  As with section 18 requests, the need for a section 409 tolerance willno longer be treated as an absolute bar to further consideration of a potentiallycarcinogenic minor use pesticide. In fact, a number of the pesticides listedin Table V of this document as eligible for reconsideration under the negligiblerisk standard are intended for minor uses.  <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Response to the Third Recommendation of the NAS  </ITAG>The NAS has recommended that EPA focus on one major crop at a time andevaluate the risks posed by all the major pesticides registered for thatcrop rather than evaluating individual pesticides according to currentprocedures. The Agency's historical approach to reregistration has beento divide pesticides into ``clusters'' according to their predominant uses.A cluster is a group of chemicals and a group of sites that are closelycorrelated.  This approach was described in a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice (45 FR 75488, November 14, 1980). Theclusters were then ranked so that higher priority for review was givento those clusters that have significant use on food crops or were alreadyknown to pose special problems. Each individual pesticide chemical withinthe cluster is then evaluated, one at a time, for all of its uses. Thus,most of the major pesticides used on the 15 ``high-consumption'' cropsidentified by the NAS Report have had a recent comprehensive review orare scheduled for one in the near future. Appendix D of this document providesa status report on the Agency's review of 10 chemicals which have beenidentified as posing certain theoretical risks.  The NAS committee's recommended modification of EPA's approach is designedto ensure that final Agency decisions actually reduce dietary risk, helpto preserve benefits of pesticide uses that pose low risks, and help toconserve limited Agency resources. The Agency agrees that this approachhas merit in certain cases where the apparent risks are high and sufficientinformation is available to make comparative risk/benefit assessments.It also allows greater certainty that the final result will improve publichealth by comparing the risks and the benefits of the major alternativesat the same time.  Given the progress already made in the reregistration process, it is likeythat the Agency will have the needed data on the major pesticides at approximatelythe same time so that comparative assessments can be done, at least forsome crop/chemical combinations. During 1988, in fact, the Agency willbe able to complete risk assessments for all but one of the six major fungicides(the exception is folpet, whose food use is relatively minor) and to comparethe risks and benefits for these chemicals as recommended by the NAS. There are, however, some problems associated with this approach. Timelinesswill certainly be sacrificed in many cases. There will be more data toevaluate, and decisions will be more complex. Comparison of benefits maybe difficult: available efficacy data are not designed to permit sophisticatedbenefits comparisons, and knowledge of all practical alternatives to agiven pesticide may be limited and hard for the Agency to identify. Forexample, a pesticide might be effective for certain uses and yet mightnever have been registered for those uses because of a registrant's marketingstrategy. Finally, it would not be advisable or protective of the publichealth to delay consideration of significant risks associated with a pesticidejust because other pesticides used on the same crops cannot be evaluatedat the same time due to the lack of key data. Consequently, the Agencyexpects to continue with its basic reregistration scheme for schedulinginitial Registration Standards. However, adjustments will be made to allowconsideration of alternatives whenever sufficient information is availableand it appears to improve our ability to focus on high risk chemical/cropcombinations.     Because of the Agency's basic priority scheme for Registration Standards,complete data bases for pesticides used on similar crops should be availableat roughly the same time, as in the case with the fungicides discussedin Appendix D. The sophistication of the comparative analyses may varysignificantly, however, depending on the level of risk associated withthe pesticide under review. In the case of cyanazine, for example, thefinal decision document discusses the known effects and the regulatorystatus of major alternatives briefly, but does not provide an extensiveanalysis because the Agency had concluded that the continued use of cyanazinedid not pose unreasonable risks. It is likely, nevertheless, that the Agencywill find it increasingly possible to make critical comparisons of pesticideswhich may substitute for each other.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Response to the Fourth Recommendation of the NAS</ITAG>EPA is taking steps to implement the NAS recommendation to develop improvedtools and methods to estimate more systematically the overall impact ofprospective regulatory actions on health, the environment, and food production.A major new analytical tool that allows the Agency greater sophisticationin the assessment of dietary risk is the computerized Tolerance AssessmentSystem (TAS). TAS contains information on toxicology and residue date forparticular pesticides, as well as food consumption information. Consumptioninformation for various foods is based on a 1977-1978 nationwide surveyof food consumption for different subgroups conducted by the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture (USDA). The TAS can be used to estimate dietary levels ofpesticide residues for the average individual, as well as for 22 populationsubgroups, including various age and ethnic groups, infants, pregnant women,and nursing mothers. The system can also be used to differentiate overallconsumption patterns by season and by region.One option offered by the TAS is the calculation of separate TMRCs (TheoreticalMaximum Residue Contribution, see Appendix A) for each of the 22 subgroups,based on the assumption that residues will be present at tolerance leveland that 100 percent of the crop is treated. Alternatively, the TAS maybe used to calculate an ``Anticipated Residue Contribution'' (ARC) whereverifiable data are available on the actual distribution of residues ontreated crops, the dissipation or concentration of residues during thestorage, transport, and processing of food commodities, and/or the percentageof the total crop actually treated with a pesticide.Since 1986, the TAS has been used to determine if there are particulardietary concerns for pesticides undergoing reevaluation in the RegistrationStandard Process, for new chemicals and new uses of old chemicals, andfor any other pesticide for which the Agency has a special dietary concern.To solicit guidance on the scientific criteria that EPA should considerin developing its policy regarding the use of the TAS, the Agency presenteda paper entitled ``Briefing Paper on the Tolerance Assessment System (TAS)for Presentation to the FIFRA Science Advisory Panel'' to that Panel inMarch 1987 to address a number of specific issues. A copy of that paperand the Report of SAP Recommendations is available on request from theOffice of Pesticide Programs. In particular, the Agency requested adviceon the scientific criteria the Agency should consider for the use of populationsubgroups in a dietary exposure analysis, and for the use of percentilesof exposure within a particular population in estimations of dietary risk.The Agency also asked the Panel to address the appropriate margins of safetywhich the Agency should use for determining acceptable exposures for subgroupsor percentiles of exposure within a subgroup. Finally, the Agency requestedguidance on the scientific criteria that should be used in identifyingappropriate residue levels for use in dietary exposure estimations, andon data presentation.In response, the SAP noted that the TAS will enable the Agency to predictexposure levels for population subgroups with far greater precision thanthe current system and thus represents an improved approach. On the issueof the appropriate use of population subgroups, the Panel, noting thatthe focus of the TAS is on exposure rather than on toxicity, commentedthat calculations based on body weight, will tend to overstate the riskto infants where there is no toxicological basis for increased susceptibility.To correct for this factor, the Panel recommended that the Agency explorethe use of body surface rather than body weight as a basis for comparison.On the safety factor issue, the Panel did not recommend any changes tothe traditionally-used one-hundred fold safety factor. The Panel also suggestedthat the use of a controlled field study would be more likely to provideuseful data for the TAS than monitoring data. Finally, the Panel recommendedthat data should be presented in such a way as to indicate the relianceof the approach on exposure, rather than on toxicity, and the Agency shouldindicate how relevance, biological significance, and other issues couldbe introduced into the process. The Agency will work to refine the TAS,as recommended by the Panel, and will seek to develop additional toolsand methods to improve its risk/benefit assessment capabilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Related Agency Activities</ITAG>The Agency is working on a number of other initiatives and program improvementswhich are related to the issues discussed here.A. FFDCA Section 408/409 Procedural RulesThe Agency has made considerable progress in developing consistent proceduralrules pertaining to section 408 and 409 tolerances. Elsewhere in this issueof the<T4> Federal Register,</T4> the Agency is proposing new procedural rulesfor establishing, modifying, and revoking section 409 food additive regulations,as well as procedural rules governing the filing of objections, requestsfor hearings, and the holding of hearings under sections 408 and 409. Theseproposed rules not only will modernize out-of-date hearing rules, but alsowill restate and update practices that have not necessarily been codified.The next step in the regulatory process will be to expand the regulationsto include (1) substantive interpretations and criteria for determiningwhen tolerances and food additive regulations are required and what dataare required in support of them and (2) the criteria and assumptions tobe used by EPA in determining whether a tolerance or food additive regulationshould be established, modified or revoked.B. Encouraging Safer PesticidesThe Agency plans to take steps to encourage the development of safer pesticides.The Agency expects to publish a<T4> Federal Register</T4> notice detailing this plan in the near future.C. Promoting Innovation in Pest ControlDespite gaps in current data bases, there are indications that human healthand/or environmental risks exist for many currently registered nematicidesand fungicides. In the case of nonfumigant nematicides, product efficacydepends largely on solubility. Solubility, however, increases soil mobility,giving rise to concern regarding ground and surface water contamination.Certain of the fumigant nematicides also are currently under Agency scrutinybecause of potential chronic risks which may be incurred by workers. Ofthe registered fungicides, 12 are currently undergoing Special Review,and additional classes of fungicides may be placed in Special Review inthe near future.The Agency is working with the Agricultural Research Service and the CooperativeState Research Service to focus USDA research efforts on development ofalternative controls for nematodes and plant disease. The Agency has identifieda particular need for alternative controls for nematodes on citrus andpotatoes and for plant diseases on tomatoes, grapes, leafy vegetables,and pome fruits. The Agency is also considering what incentives can beintroduced into the registration process to encourage development of alternativecontrols. These may include waivers of tolerance fees and registrationfees for new pesticides that fall into specified categories for which alternativecontrols are desirable.The agency has also joined with USDA, FDA, and private industry to establisha National Pest Management Task Force. The Task Force will identify thosepests of economic significance for which effective chemical controls areno longer available or for which little or no research or registrationeffort is underway. The Task Force will develop, in conjunction with memberagencies and private associations, mechanisms fostering the developmentof acceptable control technologies.D. Revision of Product Performance GuidelinesTo improve the efficacy data base, the Agency is in the process of revisingits Product Performance Guidelines to require the development of ``comparativeproduct performance data.'' In the past, product performance data requirementshave concentrated on efficacy data that demonstrate how well a pesticidecontrols the pests listed on the label. The proposed revisions will requirethat registrants develop and maintain data which will provide informationon performance of a pesticide compared to alternative pesticides, non-chemicaltechniques, and untreated controls.E. Updating Food Consumption Data and Other TAS ImprovementsResources permitting, EPA hopes to update the food consumption data aspart of our overall effort to implement TAS fully. Results of the latestUSDA dietary survey should start coming in later this year, and the Agencyplans to begin updating the TAS data in 1989. Subsequently, EPA hopes toupdate TAS every 10 years as results of a new USDA survey become available.The Agency also hopes to be able to enhance the analytical capabilitiesof TAS and to develop statistical guidelines and computer support for theincorporation of more accurate anticipated residue data based on actualresidue studies.F. Updating Animal Feed DataLike human food consumption estimates, animal food consumption estimatesalso need updating. The Agency is currently working on a project to determinewhether by-products from food processing plants are significant componentsof animal feeds. Once these significant feed items are identified, percentof diet figures for these new feed items will be determined.G. Guidelines and Protocol ImprovementsTo provide for improved data for use in risk assessments, the Agency isdeveloping guidelines and standard evaluation procedures for the use ofregistrants and food producers in the generation and submission of datato show actual pesticide residues in food. The Agency will also be workingwith the food industry to develop protocols for processing studies designedto show what happens to pesticide residues during processing.H. Reclassification of Raw Versus Processed CommoditiesThe Agency intends to develop new criteria for classification of commoditiesas raw or processed in order to update and eliminate inconsistent 408/409commodity classifications.I. Factoring in Drinking Water Exposure to PesticidesThe Agency is concerned about human intake of pesticides via routes otherthan food, particularly drinking water. Historically, the Agency has basedits decisions on tolerances only on dietary exposure from foods treatedwith pesticides. More recently the Office of Pesticides Programs (OPP)and the Office of Drinking Water (ODW) have begun focusing on drinkingwater as a potential source of pesticide residues in the diet. The Agencyhas recently made significant progress in its efforts to integrate activitiesor OPP and ODW with respect to pesticides in groundwater. All Health Advisoriesfor pesticides in drinking water are now developed jointly by ODW and OPP,using the same data base and the same reference dose.As a part of EPA's implementation of its Agricultural Chemicals in GroundwaterStrategy, the Agency will be considering the extent to which pesticideresidues in drinking water are a significant factor in dietary exposureto pesticide residues. This may be difficult in some cases, but is necessaryin order to get a more complete picture of exposure. In cases where pesticidesdo reach drinking water supplies, it is necessary to factor this exposureinto tolerance decisions.For example, exposure to aldicarb through drinking water as a result ofits presence in groundwater is being considered in the tolerance assessmentin the special review of aldicarb. This is a case in which the data areavailable, and it is clear that drinking water is a potential route ofexposure.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Conclusion</ITAG>In conclusion, the Agency believes that he recommendations of the NAS offerthe Agency very useful guidance in improving and refining the process ofevaluating pesticides for registration and tolerance purposes. Consistencybetween the criteria EPA uses in registering pesticides under FIFRA andin setting tolerances for pesticide residues on food under sections 408and 409 of the FFDCA is a clearly desirable goal. A negligible risk approachto the pesticide regulatory process would allow the Agency to move in thedirection of greater consistency, and allow the registration of new pesticidesthat pose lower risks than certain currently registered products.The Agency also believes it would be desirable to have the authority toreview all food additive regulations, as well as tolerances and registrationactions, under a risk/benefit standard. Only by using a risk/benefit standardfor all pesticide decisions will the Agency be able to achieve real consistency,and have the latitude to properly exercise its judgment based on a considerationof all relevant factors. Such an approach, over the long run, will be mostlikely to reduce the total risk attributable to pesticide use. As discussedin this document, the Agency cannot fully implement this goal without legislativechange.Nevertheless, the Agency will propose to follow the negligible-risk approachto the extent possible in future rulemakings on individual pesticides.With regard to the other recommendations of the NAS, the Agency is focusingits energies on reviewing chemicals under a prioritization scheme in orderto reduce risks attributable to pesticide use. Finally, the Agency is engagedin developing tools such as the Tolerance Assessment System to refine itsability to make regulatory decisions.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 11, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor J. Kimm,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Administrator, Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix A_Procedures Followed by the Agency in Determining AllowableResidue Levels for Tolerances and Food Additive Regulations</ITAG>In setting tolerances, EPA reviews residue chemistry data and toxicologydata. The required data are essentially the same as those necessary tosupport the registration of a pesticide product used on food. To be acceptable,a tolerance level must be both high enough to cover residues likely tobe left when the pesticide is used in accordance with its labeling, andlow enough to be safe.The Agency estimates the level of daily exposure which is not expectedto cause appreciable risks during the human lifetime. With regard to risksother than cancer, this level is called the Accpetable Daily Intake (ADI)or Reference Dose (RfD). The ADI is calculated by dividing the no-observedeffect level (NOEL) (the dosage level at which any adverse effects observedat higher dose levels are absent) from the most senstivie test showingadverse effects by an appropriate safety factor. This calculation is basedon the concept that the risks of concern other than cancer are thresholdeffects_i.e., below the ADI there will be no adverse effect.EPA also calculates the theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC),which represents the maximum amount of residue of a pesticide which a typicalhuman could ingest by consuming food that bears the maximum level of theresidue allowable under all existing and proposed tolerances. The TMRCis calculated by multiplying the tolerance level for each food by the amountof that in the typical American diet (according to available statisticson food consumption patterns) and totalling the values for all foods whichmay bear residues of that pesticide.The TMRC is then compared with the ADI, and the tolerance is established(assuming no other concerns) if the TMRC is less than the ADI. A tolerancemay be established in certain situations where the TMRC is higher thanthe ADI if residue data establish that the actual human exposure is notlikely to exceed the ADI. For pesticides which may induce cancer, in additionto performing the ADI calculations discussed above for the effects of concernother than cancer, the Agency usually performs a quantitative risk assessmentfor the cancer risk. Cancer ordinarily is treated as a non threshold effect,because of a lack of evidence to refute the assumption that the carcinogenicresponse in humans to low doses is approximately proportional to the responsein animals to high dose. Thus, some risk presumptively could result evenat very low levels of exposure.EPA's current carcinogencity testing scheme requires the use of severaltest doses (up to a level at or near the maximum tolerated dose) in atleast two animal species, in order to magnify the likelihood of detectionof a carcinogenic response in an economical, practically-sized animal testpopulation (50 animals per sex per dose level) animal test population.At the present time, there is not better way to assess practically thepotential carcinogenicity of a pesticide to which the entire U.S. populationmay be exposed. The animal data, and any available human epidemiology data,are assessed in accordance with EPA's ``Cancer Assessment Guildelines,designed for use by all Agency programs in implementing a number of statutesdesigned to protect the public health, provide a qualititative classificationscheme regarding human carcinogenicity based on a weight-of-the-eveidenceanalysis of the available data. Chemicals are classified into five groups,as follows:1. Group AHuman Carcinogen: (Sufficient evidence of cancer causality from human epidemiologicstudies).2. Group BProbable Human Carcinogen B1 limited evidence of carcinogenicity from humanepidemiologic studies B2 sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from animalstudies.3. Group CPossible Human Carcinogen: Limited evidence of carcinogenicity in animalsin the absence of human data, including malignant tumor response in a singlewell-conducted experiment not meeting conditions for sufficient evidence,tumor responses of marginal statistical significance in studies havinginadequate design or reporting, benign tumors where short-term mutagenicitytests are negative, and responses of marginal statistical significancein a tissue with high background rate.4. Group DNot classifiable as to Human Carcinogenicity: Either inadequate evidenceof carcinogenicity or absence of data.5. Group EEvidence of Non-Carcinogenicity for Humans: No evidence of carcinogenicityin at least two adequate animal tests in different species or in both adequateepidemiologic and animal studies.A weight-of-the-evidence determination may involve consideration of, amongother things, (1) the particular bioassay test system(s) used, (2) theevaluation of the histopathological and other results of the test(s), (3)the weight to be given to benign tumors, (4) mechanistic considerations,e.g., a situation where the chemical itself does not cause the tumor, butrather the effect the chemical causes at high doses of administration isthe tumor-causing agent, and this effect would not occur at the lower dosesof human exposure, and (5) the extent to which the overall quality andconduct of the tests accords with good laboratory practices.Quantitative risk assessments are routinely performed for Category A andB carcinogens. In the case of pesticides classified as Category C, theAgency decides on a case-by-case basis whether the qualitative evidenceis sufficient to warrrant a quantitative risk assessment, bearing in mindthe possibility that publishing a risk number may create in the publicmind an assumption of the reality of a risk to humans that is not supportedby the qualitative data from animal studies.To estimate the cancer risk posed by a pesticide from animal data, theAgency typically uses the linearized multistage model to extrapolate fromthe results seen at the high doses of the animal study to predict worstcase risks at the much lower levels of estimated or actual human exposure.Using this model, a potency factor (Q<T2>1</T2>*, called the ``Q-star'') is calculated from the 95 percent confidencelimit of the slope of the linearized portion of the dose response curve.This potency factor represents a plausible, statistically-derived upperlimit to the carcinogenic potency of the potential carcinogen at dosesrelevant to human exposure, and when multiplied by human exposure, yieldsan upper bound estimate of the risk. Such an estimate does not representthe actual risk, which may, in fact, be considerably lower or even as lowas zero. Estimates of the upper limit on lifetime dietary risk from consumptionof residues of a carcinogenic pesticide are calculated by multiplying theQ<T2>1</T2>* by the average human dietary exposure, using food factors derivedfrom USDA data on food consumption patterns. Unless data are availableon the actual level of residues in particular food commodities, a worst-caserisk will be calculated based on the assumption that all treated food bearsresidues at the tolerance level and that 100 percent of the crops are treated.EPA's current method of deriving these worst-case risk estimates for acarcinogenic chemical from animal data is based on somewhat more conservativepremises than the approach of FDA. FDA assumes that humans and animalsare equally sensitive to the test chemical on an equivalent body weightbasis. EPA, on the other hand, bases its assessment on the premise thatdifferent sized animals are not equally sensitive to equal concentrationsof a chemical, and makes a surface area adjustment to account for thisdifference.\1\<NOTE/> The effect of this adjustment is to increase the estimateof human risk by about thirteen fold where data are derived from mice,and about 6\1/2\ fold when the data source is the rat as the test animal.Accordingly, EPA's risk numbers represent about an order of magnitude ofrisk greater than would be calculated using FDA methodology.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Theoretically, this assumption is based on the premisethat smaller animals, which eliminate heat from the body (an indicationof metabolism) more efficiently than larger animals, are more efficientmetabolically at detoxifying a chemical than larger animals. This differencein heat elimination has been related to the ratio of the surface area tothe volume of the organism. Mathematically, the correction for surfacearea differences is made by dividing the dose in the animal study by theratio of human body weight to test animal body weight to the two-thirdspower.<ITAG

tagnum="85">Appendix D_Examples of Pesticide Chemicals With Tolerance Issues Currentlyor Recently Under Review</ITAG>1. BenomylBenomyl is a broad spectrum systemic fungicide that controls a wide varietyof plant diseases in field and vegetable crops, rice, tree fruit and nutcrops, greenhouse, ornamentals, and turf sites. It is also used as a postharvestdip for fruits. In the Registration Standard issued for benomyl on March31, 1986, the Agency concluded that benomyl and its major metabolite, 4-methylbenzimidazole carbamate (MBC), were possible human carcinogens (Group C),based on a significant increase in hepatocellular carcinomas in closelyrelated strains of mice. Based on the established tolerances and the percentof crop treated, the Agency estimated any potential oncogenic risk fromdietary exposure to be in the range of 10^5. The Agency noted, however,that this quantitative assessment should not be accorded much weight sincethe evidence for oncogenicity is limited, but could be taken to representa worst-case upper limit for risk. The Registration Standard also reassessedthe residue data base supporting the established tolerance and food additiveregulations for benomyl and concluded that additional data were requiredto fill the identified data gaps. A conclusion was also reached that additionalfood additive regulations under section 409 may be required to cover residuesin the processed fractions of citrus, tomatoes, grapes, and soybeans.The additional residue data required by the Standard were received in thesummer of 1987 and are under review. When general metabolism data (dueJuly 1989) are received, EPA will be able to complete the tolerance reassessmentfor benomyl.If the new data indicate that additional section 409 regulations are necessary,the Agency could establish such regulations under a de minimis approachif weight-of-the-evidence considerations lead to a conclusion that therisk to humans is negligible.2. CaptafolCaptafol, which was originally registered in 1962, is used as a fungicideon various vegetable and fruit crops. The Registration Standard for captafol,completed in September 1984, estimated a dietary risk of 10^4 based ontolerance levels, and required registrants to produce data on actual residuesin food crops and additional oncogenicity data. A Special Review was alsoinitiated. In early 1987, EPA classified captafol as a B2 (probable human)oncogen. The major registrant, Chevron Chemical Company, voluntarily cancelledits captafol registrations in March 1987. Formulators followed suit thenext month. On August 22, 1988, the Agency terminated the Special Reviewbecause all registrations of captafol products had been cancelled. Also,the Agency plans to initiate action during 1989 to revoke the remainingtolerances for captafol.3. CaptanCaptan (N-trichloromethylthio-4-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboximide) is a widelyused agricultural fungicide, currently registered for use on a number offruits and vegetables, small grains, cotton, grasses, flowers, and numeroushousehold uses. The chemical has been the subject of a recent RegistrationStandard (issued in March 1986) and a Special Review. The Agency has foundthat the dietary intake of captan resulted in an increased incidence ofuncommon adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tractin the Charles River CD-1 mouse, an increased incidence of these GI tumorsin B6C3F1 mice, and a small dose-related increased incidence of kidneytumors in Charles River CD-1 rats. The Agency also noted positive mutagenicactivity in gene mutation and chromosomal aberration assays, and a structuralrelationship to other compounds that demonstrated oncogenic effects.In the Standard, the Agency requested residue data, including field trialsto generate data for raw agricultural commodities treated at the maximumpermitted rate, and studies to show the effect of washing, peeling, cooking,and processing on residue levels. Section 408 tolerances are currentlyestablished for a number of commodities which are subjected to processing,namely potatoes, soybeans, tomatoes, oranges, grapes, sweet corn, cottonseed,and pineapples. Section 409 tolerances for captan exist for washed raisinsat 50 ppm (21 CFR 193.40; 21 CFR 193.40 redesignated as 40 CFR 185.500at 53 FR 24666, June 29, 1988) and detreated corn seed at 100 ppm (21 CFR561.65; 21 CFR 561.65 redesignated as 40 CFR 186.500 at 53 FR 24668, June29, 1988). However, the 409 tolerance for detreated corn seed is in theprocess of being revoked for failure to submit supporting data. Section409 tolerances must be set for some commodities, such as dried prunes anddry apple pomace.In the Preliminary Determination of the Special Review, issued on June2, 1985, the Agency determined that the dietary risk could be as high as10^4 based on the assumption that residues are present at tolerance levels.The new data will allow the Agency to refine its risk assessment, and determinewhether the currently established tolerances and food additive regulationsshould be revoked.4. ChlordimeformChlordimeform was previously registered for a number of fruit and vegetableinsecticide uses; however, most food uses were withdrawn by the registrantsin 1976 because preliminary results of a mouse study suggested that chlordimeformcaused malignant blood vessel tumors. In 1978, chlordimeform was registeredfor use on cotton with new restrictions to reduce applicator exposure.A Registration Standard was published for chlordimeform in January 1986,and the chemical has been referred to Special Review because of workerexposure concerns. In conducting the Registration Standard review, theAgency assessed dietary risks from the cotton use, using data on the percentof cotton crops actually treated (between 10 percent and 12 percent), andactual residue data showing chlordimeform residues ranging from 1 to 2orders of magnitude lower than tolerance levels. Dietary risk from actualresidues of chlordimeform occurring in commodities derived from treatedcotton was estimated at 10^7. Under the de minimis approach, the food additiveregulations on commodities processed from cotton would be retained.Very recently, the two registrants of the technical product have offeredto voluntarily cancel the remaining cotton use, effective within the nextyear.5. ChlorothalonilChlorothalonil is a fungicide used on numerous crops such as fruits, vegetables,and peanuts, as well as on ornamental turf. The chlorothalonil RegistrationStandard, issued in September 1984, identified significant data gaps; datahave been submitted in response to the requirements set forth in the Standard.Based on such data, EPA has classified chlorothalonil as a B2 (probablehuman) oncogen. There are no existing 409 food additive regulations forthis chemical; residue data required in the Standard will allow the Agencyto determine if such regulations are necessary. A Revised RegistrationStandard and Tolerance Reassessment is scheduled for completion in September1988. The Agency will assess during the Standard review whether the chemicalshould be referred to Special Review.6. EBDCsThe EBDCs (ethylene bisdithiocarbamates) are a group of six fungicides(maneb, mancozeb, amobam, nabam, metiram, and zineb) with a common contaminant,metabolite, and degradation product called ethylene-thiourea (ETU). In1984, a data call-in imposed extensive data requirements on the registrantsof the EBDCs to enable the Agency to perform a comprehensive risk assessment.In response, registrants of amobam cancelled their products, and registrantsof nabam deleted all food uses from their labels. Based on data receivedin response to the data call-in, the Agency has classified ETU and theEBDCs as B2 (probable human) oncogens. As set forth in the RegistrationStandard issued in April 1987, the dietary risk for mancozeb is estimatedto be 10-4 based on actual residue data. The total dietary risks resultingfrom the use of all the EBDCs is likely to be higher. Residue data on maneband metiram were received in March 1988. For zineb, which represents only5 percent of total EBDC usage, residue data will not be available until1991.All the EBDCs have been placed in Special Review; the Preliminary Determinationis scheduled for early 1989. The Agency expects to conduct a risk assessmentof the dietary risk posed by these chemicals in the summer and fall of1988, and then to conduct a comparative risk/benefit assessment of themajor fungicides (EBDCs, captan, chlorothalonil and benomyl) before makinga regulatory decision on any one of them. As part of that review, the Agencywill also determine what action to take with respect to the existing tolerancesand food additive regulations. There are several food additive regulationsfor mancozeb, and data may indicate the need for such regulations for maneb,metiram, and zineb.7. FolpetFolpet is a broad spectrum fungicide which, in the past, has been usedon both food and nonfood crops and as an industrial fungicide in the manufactureof coatings and plastics. Non-agricultural uses and home and garden useshave accounted for approximately 86 percent of its total usage. A RegistrationStandard was issued for folpet in June 1987, and additional residue data(due in 1991) were requested. Currently, all food uses have been suspendedfor failure to provide data. Current indications are that the only fooduse which is likely to be supported by data is the use on avocadoes.The chemical has been classified as a B2 (probable human) oncogen. Priorto the recent suspensions, theoretical dietary risks, based on the assumptionthat residues would be present at tolerance levels, were in the 10-4 range,but the Agency believes that, if actual residue data and percent of croptreated were factored into the risk calculation, risks would be likelyto be in the 10-6 range. There are no existing section 409 food additiveregulations for folpet. If any food uses are reinstituted, and if residuedata show that there is a concentration effect during processing, suchregulations would be necessary. If the data indicate that the risk is infact in the 10-6 range, the <T3>de minimis </T3>approach could be followed in establishing such regulations.8. LinuronLinuron, a herbicide used for pre- and post-emergent control of annualgrasses and broadleaf weeds, was initially registered in 1966, and a numberof tolerances have been established since then for its use on soybeans,corn, cotton, sorghum, wheat, asparagus, carrots, celery, parsnips. andpotatoes. There are no section 409 food or feed additive regulations forlinuron. However, the Agency has requested processing data to demonstratewhether the chemical does concentrate in processed commodities.In 1984, a Registration Standard was issued for linuron and additionalresidue and chronic effects data required. At the time of the Standard,the Agency estimated dietary oncogenic risk in the range of 10-4 (basedon residues at tolerance levels with some adjustment for percent of croptreated). However, since the time the Special Review was initiated, theAgency has issued its oncogenicity classification guidelines and has concludedthat linuron is a group C (possible human) oncogen. Because only benigntumors are formed, these tumors occur only late in life, and there is noevidence of mutagenic activity, the Agency has concluded that linuron'shuman carcinogenic potential is low. Therefore the Agency has recentlyterminated the Special Review based on oncogenicity.9. PermethrinPermethrin is an insecticide first registered in 1979 for use on cotton,with a wide variety of other uses, including vegetables and pears (registeredin 1982). The toxicology data base for permethrin is complete. The Agencyhas classified permethrin as a Group C oncogen, based on the inductionof lung and liver tumors in female mice. Based on the very weak evidenceof oncogenicity observed, the Agency determined that a quantitative riskassessment for this chemical is inappropriate because the likelihood ofoncogenic effects in humans from low levels of permethrin is non-existentor extremely low. The Agency has, however, regulated this chemical as apossible oncogen for Delaney Clause purposes, and has declined to set 409food additive regulations.A tolerance for tomatoes, a commodity which is usually subject to processing,was established for Florida tomatoes, subject to a restriction that thetomatoes only be used for the fresh market. This approach was believedto be feasible for permethrin because of the unique circumstances of tomatoproduction in Florida, i.e., 98 percent of the tomatoes were for the freshmarket, and the limited number of canneries in the area agreed not to processtomatoes into a form which would result in concentrated residues (suchas paste, puree, or ketchup). However, the Agency subsequently was informedthat a cannery in Florida was processing permethrin-treated tomatoes intopuree and paste. This incident demonstrates the impracticality of expectinggrowers and processors to distinguish between permethrin-treated tomatoesand untreated tomatoes.In addition, the Agency is still seeking processing data to clarify whetherresidues will concentrate in any of the other processed commodities producedby Florida canneries. If the Agency were to follow the <T3>de minimis </T3>approach, permethrin would be a potential candidatefor section 409 food additive regulations for additional uses in whichconcentration of the residues occurs during processing.10. TrifluralinTrifluralin is a selective preemergent herbicide registered for use ona variety of crops for the control of annual grasses and certain broadleaf weeds. This pesticide has been classified as a Group C carcinogenbased on a significant increase in the incidence of malignant tumors ofthe renal pelvis, of the kidney and thyroid gland of male rats, and inthe incidence of combined malignant and benign urinary bladder tumors infemale rats at the highest dietary concentration tested. The Agency indicatedin its August 1986 Registration Standard that processing data is beingrequired for potatoes, sugar beets, soybeans, citrus fruits, sorghum, barley,corn and wheat grain, alfalfa hay, flax seed, cottonseed, peanuts, spentpeppermint and spearmint hay, sugarcane, and sunflower seed. These datacould indicate that additional food additive regulations are necessaryto support current use patterns. Such regulations could be establishedunder a <T3>de minimis </T3>approach if risks are found to be sufficiently low.Otherwise, if the Agency takes the approach that such regulations wouldbe barred by the Delaney Clause, the corresponding section 408 tolerancesmight be subject to revocation, thereby eliminating many of the beneficialuses of this pesticide.<ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix E_Candidates for Negligible Risk Consideration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s75,r75,r75,r75,xs60</C> <H1>Chemical</H1><H1>Type</H1><H1>Status</H1><H1>Proposed Use</H1><H1>Group</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Aliette<D>Fungicide</D><D>New Use</D><D>Hops</D><D>C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Amitraz<D>Insecticide</D><D>New Use</D><D>Apples</D><D>C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Apollo<D>Insecticide</D><D>New Chemical</D><D>Apples</D><D>C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cypermethrin corn<D>Insecticide</D><D>New Uses</D><D>Soybeans</D><D>C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dicamba \1\<D>Herbicide</D><D>New Use</D><D>Cotton</D><D>Not classified.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Glyphosate<D>Herbicide</D><D>New Use</D><D>Wheat</D><D>C/D</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Harvade<D>Herbicide</D><D>New Use</D><D>Sunflowers</D><D>C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methomyl \2\<D>Insecticide</D><D>New Use</D><D>Hops</D><D>Not classified.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Metolachlor<D>Herbicide</D><D>New Uses</D><D>Apples, flax, sunflowers</D><D>C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Permethrin corn<D>Insecticide</D><D>New Uses</D><D>Soybeans, apples, tomatoes</D><D>Treated as C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Savey<D>Insecticide</D><D>New Chemical</D><D>Apples</D><D>C</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Verdict<D>Herbicide</D><D>New Chemical</D><D>Soybeans</D><D>In review</D><F>\1\ A nitrosoamine contaminant of dicamba is an oncogen.</F><F>\2\ Acetamide is an oncogen and an animal metabolite of methomyl.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix F Group C Carcinogens' Status Re Risk Quantification</ITAG>The decision as to whether or not quantification of risk for Group C chemicalsis appropriate is subject to change as the Agency analyzes new data orreevaluate existing data.
