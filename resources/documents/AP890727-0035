The work is the first detailed study that links the Antarctichole to observed ozone declines in the Southern Hemisphere'smidlatitudes, where many people live, scientists said.   The study concludes that record low ozone levels over southernAustralia and New Zealand were caused mainly by the arrival ofozone-poor air from the Antarctic hole.   Southern South America and the southern tip of Africa also maybe vulnerable, said study co-author R. Alan Plumb.   A layer of ozone, a form of oxygen, high in the atmosphereshields Earth from ultraviolet rays in sunlight that cause skincancer. Reductions in ozone let more rays through and can boostskin cancer rates.   The Antarctic ozone hole, which appears for a limited time everyyear, is an area in which up to 50 percent of ozone disappears.   Plumb said that while he regards the declines observed overAustralia and New Zealand as relatively small, they could becomemore hazardous.   But Margaret Kripke, an immunologist who studies skin cancer,said the increase in ultravolet rays implied by the ozoneobservations is ``enormous.''   Such increases could raise the risk of skin cancer, but it isdifficult to say by how much, said Kripke, chairman of theimmunology department at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center of theUniversity of Texas.   Protection of the worldwide ozone shield has become a focus ofinternational concern that extends beyond the Antarctic ozone hole.Last year, for example, scientists announced evidence that ozonehad declined about 2.3 percent since 1969 over a region thatincludes most of the United States.   In May, delegates from 81 countries at a U.N. conference pledgedto stop producing and using chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons,which destroy ozone, by the year 2000.   The new study was conducted by Plumb of the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology; Paul Newman, of the Universities SpaceResearch Association and a visiting scientist at the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center inGreenbelt, Md.; and researchers from Australia and New Zealand.   It appears today in the British journal Nature.   ``It makes a convincing case to me,'' commented William Mankinof the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.   The Antarctic ozone hole was unusual in 1987, the study said.Ozone levels reached record lows in October and November, and thefunnel-shaped wind pattern that sustained the hole disintegrated inearly December rather than November.   With the disintegration of the wind pattern each year, streamsof polar air are ripped away and migrate north, the researcherssaid.   They concluded that the arrival of such ozone-poor air was thechief factor in producing record low ozone levels over southernAustralia and New Zealand in December 1987.   The levels reported over the Australian cities Melbourne andPerth for much of the month were the lowest December readings sincemeasurements began in 1979.   The Melbourne readings averaged about 7 percent below normal forthe month, which theoretically could boost the dose of ultravioletrays at the Earth's surface by 14 percent, Plumb said.   Newman said Australians are typically on the beaches inDecember, the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. As aresult, low ozone readings during that month are particularlyworrisome.   For the most common skin cancers, which develop only afterdecades of exposure to ultraviolet rays, a single episode of ozonereduction may not have much effect, said Kripke.   But reductions would pose a hazard if they continue for anotherdecade or so, she said.   Some recent studies suggest that the risk of the deadliest skincancer, melanoma, may be increased by a single exposure to excessultraviolet rays, Kripke noted. But too little is known about thecauses of melanoma to gauge the risk of a single summer's exposure,she said.</TEXT></DOC>
