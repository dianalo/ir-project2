The data arelimited in several respects. All conclusions drawn from the data mustbe qualified with these limitations. Baseline conditions were determinedby analyzing data from wells in the upper bedrock and lower bedrock aquifersand from the alluvial wells. Baseline data were considered all data collectedbefore mining operations began. The water quality was then evaluatedusing the 1987 Colorado State Basic Standards for Ground Water as a basis.The maximum baseline values for several parameters in each aquifer exceedthe standard values. The quality of the upper lower bedrock aquifersvaries from region to region within the site. Data on the lower bedrockaquifer are insufficient for speculation on the cause of the variations.Variations in the upper bedrock aquifer are possibly caused by leakageof the lower bedrock aquifer. 16 refs., 9 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
