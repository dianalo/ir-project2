President Bush today condemned Chinese authorities for the``violent and bloody'' crackdown and said he was ordering animmediate suspension of American military sales and commericalexport of weapons to China.   ``We deplore the decision to use force,'' Bush told reporters ina hastily convened news conference in Washington. He urged Chineseauthorities ``to avoid violence and to return to their previouspolicy of restraint.''   There also were calls for a United Nations session, and Chinesepeople in many countries protested the heavy casualties in theChinese army's assaults Sunday and today on crowds of students andother civilians in Beijing.   World leaders including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherand Pope John Paul II expressed dismay and concern at the violence,which had a particularly strong impact on China's neighbors such asHong Kong and Taiwan, where huge sympathy demonstrations were held.   ``The stability of China is important for peace and stability onthe Korean peninsula and the rest of Asia,'' a Foreign Ministryspokesman in South Korea said today. The spokesman said Seoul hopesthe situation ``can be resolved peacefully.''   The Hong Kong stock market suffered its worst fall since the1987 worldwide market collapse. The Hang Seng Index of blue chipslost 581.77 points in the day's trading, closing at 2,093.61.   China's fast economic growth in recent years has been animportant tonic for Asian countries, and the chance of prolongedturmoil in China was a setback to the confidence that had beenbuilding as the region seemed more tranquil with progress inSino-Soviet relations and in Indochina.   ``A China with large sections of her people, including her besteducated, at odds with the government, means trouble,'' saidSingapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. ``China could createproblems for herself and her neighbors.''   Hong Kong, a British colony, is to revert to Chinese rule in1997 under a Sino-British treaty, and the violence in Beijing hasmade its 5.7 million people deeply nervous about their future.   About 200,000 people rallied Sunday in Hong Kong to denounce thekillings, and many people wept as they watched televised reportsfrom Beijing.   In Taiwan, 100,000 protesters marched in the three largestcities today and share prices plunged. The stock market index endedat 9,120.54 points, down 455.44 points, the largest single-day fallin the market's 27-year history.   The market drop was prompted by concern the $2.7 billion tradewith the mainland would suffer, analysts said. Trade between Taiwanand China through third parties was permitted by Taiwan's governingNationalists two years ago, although the government still bansofficial contacts between the governments.   In Britain, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe summoned asenior Chinese diplomat to a meeting today.   Meanwhile, David Howell, a legislator in Mrs. Thatcher'sConservative Party, urged her to seek new assurances from Beijingon Hong Kong's future. ``Having got a treaty with a government thatcan shoot people down like this, we must have a reassurance thatthe spirit of the treaty stands,'' Howell said.   The treaty calls for Hong Kong to be able to keep itsfreewheeling socioeconomic lifestyle after China takes over.   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke protested by canceling aplanned October visit to China, and his foreign minister, GarethEvans, summoned the Chinese ambassador today for consultations.   ``We had admired the restraint that had been demonstrated by theChinese government until the weekend and were shocked at the extentto which that restraint has now been abandoned,'' Evans saidafterward.   In West Germany, Labor Minister Norbert Bluem said there shouldbe a special session of the United Nations on the assault.   ``A government that scorns human life and tramples on humanrights must reckon with contempt from all civilized states,'' Bluemsaid in a statement.   In an unusual move, the normally neutral Swiss governmentsummoned the Chinese ambassador to condemn the ``brutal'' use offorce.   In the Philippines, President Corazon Aquino said she was ``verysad about the violent turn of events in China.'' But her ForeignMinistry spokesman, Jose Ingles, said that while his countrysympathized with the Chinese people, ``We cannot presume tointerfere in their internal affairs.''   Philippine Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, who has visited China twice inan effort to improve relations between Beijing and the Vatican,said he was ``greatly dismayed'' at the use of military force.   Pope John Paul II, on a tour of Scandinavia, expressed concern.``As Christians,'' he said, ``we hope that these deaths may serveto bring about new life in that great and beloved country.''   Soviet television broadcast dramatic footage of the clashesbetween Chinese troops and protesters, but Soviet officials weresilent on the attack.   Japan's Foreign Ministry said Sunday it was ``gravelyconcerned'' and hopes ``that the situation will not deterioratefurther.''   Feng Ruomin, one of hundreds of Chinese students whodemonstrated in Tokyo and other Japanese cities, said: ``Thestudents in Beijing haven't even broken a windowpane, how can youcall that a riot?''   Other protests by Chinese students were held in Paris, London,Vienna, San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Oslo, the Hague andVancouver.</TEXT></DOC>
