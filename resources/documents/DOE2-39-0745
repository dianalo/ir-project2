The brightest 2 {mu}m continuum source, IRS-1, maybe either a peak in the reflection nebula or a self-luminous object,although the former requires very large near-infrared continuum and recombinationbrightness from the true luminosity source. Confirmation of either modelrequires observations with higher spatial resolution. A second source,IRS-2, is a very young object with strong recombination lines but noaccompanying 5 GHz continuum emission. Photometry indicates a visualextinction of {ge} 34 mag towards IRS-2, assuming a hot stellar photosphere.The source of luminosity in the reflection nebula has a ZAMS stellartype between B 0.5 and O7 or equivalent, and is probably coincident withthe ultracompact H II region W75N(OH). Molecular hydrogen emission ina slightly undersampled 1.5 x 2 arcmin/sup 2/ area has also been mapped.</TEXT></DOC>
