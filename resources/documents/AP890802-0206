The gasindustry immediately attacked the report as flawed and biased.   The New England Fuel Institute, an oil industry group based inWatertown, Mass., commissioned University of Minnesota ProfessorDean E. Abrahamson to compare the two fuels.   Abrahamson, a physicist, is a public policy professor at theuniversity's Humbert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs andco-chairman of the school's Council of Environmental Quality. Heedited and was a co-author of ``The Challenge of Global Warming,''a book sponsored by the Natural Resources Defense Council, anenvironmental group. He serves on the council's board of trustees.   Ted Kinne, vice president at the Interstate Natural GasAssociation of America, an industry group representing pipelinecompanies, said the study ``is clearly biased towards oil. It isobvious who is paying for this study.''   Abrahamson, at a news conference sponsored by the New EnglandFuel Institute, defended the independence of his study.   ``The Oil Task Force put absolute no constraints'' on the study,he said.   Scientists believe several gases allow warmth from the sun topass through to the earth's surface, but block outgoing radiation,raising the planet's temperature in the same way a greenhouse stayswarm.   The chief contributor, accounting for about half the predictedfuture warming, is carbon dioxide, an inevitable product ofcombustion of any carbon-containing fuel.   Methane is another such gas, and natural gas is almost allmethane.   For equivalent heat output, it has long been known that oilproduces about 40 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas.   The study said global warming from natural gas heat would exceedthe global heating from oil heat if 1 percent to 2 percent of thenatural gas is lost.   Abrahamson said he found that 0.13 percent of the gas is lost inproduction and 0.54 percent is reported ``unaccounted for'' ininterstate transmission. Distribution companies report 1 percent to6 percent ``unaccounted for,'' and that does not count any thatescapes after passing through the customer's meter.   But the American Gas Association said the unaccounted for gas inall utilities includes gas theft, meter inaccuracies and otherfactors in addition to leaks.   The gas association estimated that about 0.4 percent of the gasis lost in leaks.   Abrahamson said methane causes 30 to 70 times more greenhouseheating than the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide, while gasindustry representatives said it caused only 10 percent to 30percent as much.   The Interstate Natural Gas Association criticized the study fornot taking into account the length of time the two gases will stayin the atmosphere. Methane remains in the air for 10 years, whilecarbon dioxide remains for 500 years, Kinne said.   ``He assumes it is not worth considering. I think the effect isvery signficiant,'' Kinne said.   Dennis Tirpak, an Environmental Protection Agency official whohas conducted studies of the greenhouse effect for the agency, saidmethane was 20 times more effective, molecule for molecule, intrapping radiation than was carbon dioxide, but its lifetime in theatmosphere is also important _ eight to 11 years vs. 100 to 500years.   As to gas being a bigger contributor than oil if 1 per cent to 2percent is lost, Tirpak said, ``I think you'd have to go higherthan than but I can't really say without having studied theirstatements.''   Methane concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing at about1 percent per year and no one has determined why, though there areseveral theories. Some studies suggest that methane could beresponsible for 20 percent of recent greenhouse warming, if therehas been any, vs. about 50 percent for carbon dioxide.</TEXT></DOC>
