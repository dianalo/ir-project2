Arab doctors said Israeli troops shot and killed a24-year-old Palestinian.   At least 10 other Palestinians were wounded in confrontationsbetween soldiers and stone-throwers in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip, Arab reports said.   Shamir called meetings for Saturday and Sunday to considerguidelines for the elections, the first with Cabinet ministers ofhis right-wing Likud bloc and the second with the full Cabinet,including members of the left-leaning Labor Party.   Shamir's proposal to end the 17-month rebellion in the occupiedlands involves elections to choose Palestinian representatives whowould negotiate with Israel for limited autonomy. Talks wouldfollow three years later on a permanent settlement.   When it meets Sunday, the 25-member government likely willsidestep controversial issues such as the participation ofPalestinians from outside the territories _ a Palestinian demandreportedly supported by the United States.   ``What we are bringing are the main principles, the skeleton ofthe plan, without getting into details,'' said a Shamir aide, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   The meetings come during a weekend visit by U.S. officials whoare expected to press Shamir for specifics such as whether 140,000Palestinians living in east Jerusalem will be able to vote andwhether there will be international supervision.   Both Radio Moscow and the Abu Dhabi newspaper Al Ittihadreported that Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafatwill accept the elections if they are held under internationalsupervision.   Shamir introduced his idea for elections last month at a meetingwith President Bush following criticism of Israel's handling of theuprising.   Since then, Palestinians in the occupied territories and thePLO, which is outlawed here, have rejected the elections.   Clashes occur daily. On Friday, five confrontations erupted inthe Gaza Strip and one in the West Bank town of El Bireh, justnorth of Jerusalem.   The worst confrontation was in Gaza City, the seaside strip'slargest town, where troops opened fire on stone-throwing youths,killing Mahmoud Awad Akraa and wounding six others, Arab hospitalofficials said.   A military spokesman confirmed Akraa's death but said apreliminary report showed no troops were in the area at the time ofthe alleged confrontation.   He said the army was continuing its investigation into the death.   The death would raise to at least 472 the number of Palestinianskilled since they started rebelling against Israeli occupation inDecember 1987. Twenty-one Israelis also have died.   The Gaza clashes occurred despite a curfew that confined thestrip's 700,000 residents to their homes for a fifth day.   In the West Bank town of Nablus, troops shot and wounded twoPalestinians including a 15-year-old.   In Israel, just north of Gaza, Israelis stoned Arab-owned carsfor a second day to protest the killing of one soldier in the areaand the disappearance of another soldier. Police have blamedPalestinians.   The incidents and the murder of two Israelis by a Palestinian inJerusalem last week have raised right-wing opposition to Shamir'selection plan.   Among opponents is Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, who says theywill bring disaster.   ``The plan will not bring peace, but a PLO Palestinian state,terror and war, and the re-division of Jerusalem,'' he told YediotAhronot newspaper.   Most Likud ministers are expected to approve and ministers ofthe Labor Party already approved the plan Thursday.   After Sunday's meeting, Shamir will meet with Dennis Ross, asenior aide to Secretary of State James Baker III. Ross arrivesSaturday night to brief Israeli leaders on Baker's talks in Moscowwith Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.   Ross also is expected to meet Palestinian leaders. He reportedlyis trying to make the election plan more attractive to them byurging Israel to allow Arabs in east Jerusalem to vote _ a conceptopposed by Shamir but favored by Labor Party leaders.   East Jerusalem was captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle Eastwar and annexed into the Israeli capital.</TEXT></DOC>
