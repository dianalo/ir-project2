Some major rail issues have fallen more than 40% from their August highs, while the overall stock market is off about 30% since then. The bears' reasoning seems to be that if the Oct. 19 market crash presages a slowing economy, rail traffic will be particularly hurt.    Wall Street is full of analysts who claim that the particular industry they follow, be it rails or restaurants, is in better shape than stock prices would suggest. Investors haven't made much money listening to analysts lately, so they're inclined to be skeptical about all the supposed bargains after the crash. But some rail analysts are pressing on anyway, convinced that a lot of facts support their bullish case.    For example, railroads are posting their highest traffic gains in years, aided by the recovery of some major industrial customers. Even if the growth rate slips next year, &quot;rail stocks could be relatively attractive,&quot; says Merrill Lynch's Richard Fischer. Moreover, some analysts expect contract negotiations between rail management and labor in 1988 to end some inefficient labor practices.    &quot;Some rail stocks are too cheap to ignore,&quot; says Michael Lloyd, a Salomon Brothers analyst. &quot;There will be some recovery as investors notice that rail traffic and profit levels will continue to look good into the third quarter 1988.&quot;    Mr. Lloyd recently added Burlington Northern to his list of recommended rail issues, which already included Consolidated Rail and CSX. He also raised his 1988 earnings estimates for Burlington Northern to $5.80 a share from $5.65 a share, compared with his 1987 estimate of $4.80 a share.    Mr. Lloyd says Burlington Northern is benefiting from strong traffic growth of coal and grain and continuing cost controls, while Conrail and CSX are capitalizing on the turnaround of Rust Belt industries. But he recently lowered his 1988 earnings forecast for CSX to $3.50 a share from $3.90, reflecting intense trans-Atlantic competition for the company's Sea-Land container ship unit.    &quot;The recovery in our basic manufacturing industries is a lot stronger than people realize,&quot; says Mr. Lloyd. Buoyed by the strength of ores, coal, metals, machinery and chemicals, rail traffic surged 8% last month. Mr. Lloyd predicts rail traffic gains will slip to about 3% next year but exceed a flat to 1% rise in gross national product. The strength of the railroads' industrial customers partly reflects the weak U.S. dollar, which is making U.S.-made goods more attractive here and abroad.    Mr. Lloyd remains neutral on Norfolk Southern. With its strong balance sheet and cash position, Norfolk Southern didn't fall as far as some rail issues since Black Monday, he says.    Some analysts remain cautious. Graeme Lidgerwood of First Boston hasn't changed her opinion that rail stocks will underperform the market during the next six months. &quot;Even though these stocks have come down, it's too early to jump in headfirst to buy them,&quot; she says.    Possible declines in automobile sales and housing starts could hold down rail profits and stock prices next year, she says. On Friday, she upgraded Union Pacific to a &quot;hold&quot; from a &quot;sell.&quot; Earlier, though, she had worried that its above-average exposure to General Motors could leave it vulnerable to auto production cutbacks.    Ms. Lidgerwood this month changed her recommendation on Burlington Northern to a &quot;sell&quot; from a &quot;hold&quot; to reflect the company's potential liability in an antitrust case brought a few years ago by a coal slurry pipeline concern. Recently, some co-defendants, including Union Pacific, settled similar charges out of court.    Joel Price of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette says rail stocks have been &quot;battered down and will move more or less with the market.&quot; The only rail stock he currently recommends is CSX, based on his hope that the company will soon &quot;make rail negotiating history.&quot; CSX is negotiating with rail unions to slash about 12,000 jobs, or about 30% of its rail workforce, in exchange for incentive bonuses tied to productivity gains.    Some analysts expect the railroad industry to make major changes in its archaic, inefficient labor practices when management and labor meet next spring to produce a new three-year contract. &quot;We're at a watershed in rail labor negotiations,&quot; says Salomon Brothers' Mr. Lloyd.    But others believe that productivity gains will come slowly and those achieved will be costly because of resistance from rail unions. &quot;There are too many barriers to be overly optimistic&quot; about an impending breakthrough in rail labor productivity, says James Voytko, a PaineWebber analyst.    Analysts say rail issues face a potential setback next year if Congress decides to re-regulate railroads, whose fortunes have improved since the industry was partly deregulated in 1980. Recently, the House transportation subcommittee voted to restore some regulation over rail freight rates, routes and branch line sales.    Such provisions, if enacted into law, would &quot;put severe pressure on the rail industry's profitability and be very negative for rail stocks,&quot; says Ms. Lidgerwood. Like other analysts though, Ms. Lidgerwood doesn't think Congress will approve any substantial re-regulation of the railroad industry. </TEXT></DOC>
