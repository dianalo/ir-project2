But administration aides also caution that Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady hasn't signed off on the selection of Mr. Breeden. Mr. Brady, a close confidant of the president, still could attempt to persuade Mr. Bush to pick economist Paul MacAvoy, the candidate preferred by some Treasury officials.    The search for an SEC chairman to succeed departing David Ruder has dragged on for months. But several officials said there is a good chance Mr. Bush will make his choice either by the end of this week or early next, before he leaves for a vacation in Maine.    Mr. Breeden is an assistant to President Bush and was the White House point man in pushing through Congress the recently completed savings-and-loan rescue package. He was deputy counsel in Mr. Bush's vice presidential office, and was staff director of the task group on financial regulation that Mr. Bush led as vice president.    One administration official involved in the selection process said Mr. Breeden is &quot;way out in front&quot; of any other candidate. The aide also said Mr. Breeden is the choice preferred by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.    Mr. Breeden is an attorney with experience in finance and securities. Before taking his current White House post, he was a partner in the law firm of Baker andamp; Botts and was head of its finance department in Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
