Harmon, a director and chairman of the executive committee of Ames Department Stores Inc., was named chairman. He succeeds Herbert Gilman, 63 years old, who is to retire next month.    Mr. Harmon, 52, who is chairman of Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co., Ames's investment banker, will continue in that post. &quot;His new role as Ames chairman is said to be a non-employee position,&quot; an Ames spokeswoman said. &quot;He won't even have an office here.&quot;    Peter B. Hollis, 44, remains president and chief executive officer. He was named chief executive in September. At that time, Mr. Gilman said he planned to reduce his activity with the company.    Mr. Harmon has been an Ames director since 1967 and executive committee chairman since 1985.    Mr. Gilman, who with his two brothers founded the chain of discount department stores nearly 30 years ago, will remain a director. But he will relinquish duties as a member of the executive committee, the company said. Mr. Gilman was on vacation and couldn't be reached for comment. Though ill with cancer last year, he is reported to be in good health.    &quot;I don't expect to see much shift in philosophy because of the new appointment,&quot; said Henry Gicha Jr., an analyst for Wood Gundy. &quot;The principals running the company (at Ames) are still running the company.&quot;    Ames has 343 discount department stores and 144 variety stores, heavily concentrated in the Northeast. The company has had weak earnings in recent quarters because of theft, mishandling of merchandise and other inventory control problems. </TEXT></DOC>
