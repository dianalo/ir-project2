Foreign aid is a natural area for Japan to contribute to globalstability ``given Japan's policy, which we fully support ... not toplay a global military role,'' said Deputy Defense SecretaryWilliam Howard Taft IV.   Japan will surpass the United States as the world's leading aiddonor this year and it can still afford a further ``dramaticincrease'' in aid, Taft added.   Taft's statement was distributed to the Senate defenseappropriations subcommittee. His position was echoed in testimonyby other Pentagon officials and the State Department at a hearingon the defense burden shared by the United States and its NortheastAsian allies, Japan and South Korea.   Assistant Defense Secretary Richard L. Armitage remindedsenators that after the defeat of Japan in World War II, ``theUnited States played a major and direct role'' in framing theconstitution that continues to bar Japan from maintaining offensivemilitary force.   Asian neighbors occupied by Japan during the war and theJapanese people themselves ``don't want to see Rising Sun flags onstrategic bombers, carrier battle groups or other power projectionsystems _ nor do we,'' Armitage added.   He said Japan obviously could afford to spend more onself-defense and will do so, but ``in terms of military roles andmissions, Japan is correctly oriented already.''   Meanwhile, Japan should substantially increase unrestricted aidgrants to poorer countries in addition to boosting existing supportfor the upkeep of 55,000 American military personnel in Japan, hesaid.   Other countries in the region accept a defense-oriented militarybuildup by Japan but ``they remain sensitive about any indicationthat Japan might develop offensive capabilities or seek a regionalsecurity role,'' said Gaston Sigur, assistant secretary of statefor East Asian and Pacific affairs.   Japan has doubled its foreign aid several times since 1980 andin the coming year will pass the United States as the world'sleading aid donor, Taft said.</TEXT></DOC>
