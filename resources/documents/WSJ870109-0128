The rating concern also said it is reviewing Allied's senior debt ratings, &quot;with a significant downgrade likely.&quot; The big retailer currently has $203.1 million of long-term debt but doesn't have any commercial paper outstanding. Moody's attributed the moves to New York-based Allied's soaring financial leverage after its acquisition by Campeau Corp., a Toronto-based real estate developer. Debt incurred in the acquisition is officially being carried by the Allied unit, not the parent corporation, Moody's said. Allied currently has about $3.8 billion of debt and preferred on a common equity base of $300 million. The long-term debt ratings under review are the single-A-2 rating on Allied's senior notes and the provisional single-A-2 rating on its shelf registration. Allied had no comment on the Moody's announcements.    ---   CENTRAL VERMONT PUBLIC SERVICE CORP. -- Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it raised its rating on the $30 million outstanding of the Rutland, Vt.-based electric utility's preferred to triple-B-plus from triple-B. Sandamp;P said &quot;construction-related stress&quot; on the company's finances was &quot;significantly reduced&quot; by Central Vermont's recent sale of its 1.59% interest in the Seabrook nuclear power project and by the beginning last year of commercial operation of the Millstone 3 nuclear plant. The ratings concern also cited a recent electricity rate increase and expectations of continued growth in the utility's service area. Central Vermont said the move reflects Sandamp;P's confidence in the utility's ability to raise its &quot;quality of earnings.&quot;    ---   JOY MANUFACTURING CO. -- Sandamp;P said it will no longer provide a rating on the company's senior debt, which had been rated single-A, and its commercial paper, which had been rated single-A-1. It said about $14 million of debt is affected. Sandamp;P said it removed the issues from its CreditWatch list, where they were placed Nov. 7 with negative implications as Joy considered restructuring moves. The Pittsburgh-based maker of mining, drilling and other industrial equipment subsequently agreed to a leveraged buyout led by Adler andamp; Shaykin for about $620 million. Sandamp;P said it is ceasing to evaluate Joy's senior debt because of the small amount involved and said the commercial-paper rating was withdrawn at the company's request. Officials of Joy couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
