(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The jailed mother of an abandoned girl whoselower legs were amputated because of severe frostbite should beallowed to visit her hospitalized daughter, according to a hospitalcounselor.   Darlwin Britt, who is 24 and unemployed, faces charges of felonychild neglect and is being held in the Lake County Jail on $50,000bond her lawyers have said she can't pay.   A hospital staff member says, however, that Ms. Britt's daughterneeds to see her mother and that a supervised visit may help thegirl recover.   The child, Darlwin Carlisle, 9, has talked with her mother onceby telephone, but has not seen her mother since the girl was foundlast month locked in an unheated and abandoned Gary apartment.   Her legs were amputated below the knee after gangrene threatenedto develop into a possibly life-threatening infection.   ``It needs to be done in a planned way,'' said Mary Martone, thecoordinator of the child abuse program at Chicago's La RabidaChildren's Hospital and Research Center, where the girl is learningto walk on artifical legs.   ``I basically think it would be appropriate for the parent andchild to have contact,'' she said in a recent interview.   The child's father, Edward J. Carlisle of Fort Wayne, and otherrelatives have visited the child, hospital officials say.   Others who believe Ms. Britt should be allowed to visit herdaughter include Gary City Councilman Roy Pratt; ConstanceMack-Ward, the director of the Gary Commission for Women, and JeanThurman, director of Project Justice and Equality.   They contend the lack of support that mothers such as Ms. Brittreceive from the system is at least partly responsible for cases ofchild neglect and abuse.   ``We release condemned murderers to go to funerals,'' saidPratt. ``We release hardened criminals on bail. I understandwanting to punish the mother. I was angry, too, until I looked atthe side of the mother.''</TEXT></DOC>
