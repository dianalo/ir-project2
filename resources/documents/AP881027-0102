(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat presidential nominee MichaelDukakis declared today that ``this election is up for grabs'' andridiculed Republican rival George Bush's assertion that his proposalfor cutting the capital gains tax would create new jobs.   ``Who's he kidding?'' Dukakis asked supporters in this Chicagosuburb. ``What are they going to do with the extra money? Hire asecond butler, a lifeguard for the pool?''   The Massachusetts governor said Bush's plan to reduce the topcapital gains tax rate from 33 percent to 15 percent was not a jobsprogram but a huge tax break for the vice president and his wealthyfriends. Bush says it would spur business investment and generatenew jobs.   ``It's Halloween come early,'' Dukakis said. ``A treat for thewealthiest 1 percent and a trick for the rest of us.''   One day after the GOP nominee touted his tax plan before Detroitbusiness leaders, Dukakis said Bush really was proposing to ``givethe the people at the top the money and hope the crumbs fall off forthe rest of us.''   He also rebuked Bush's vice presidential running mate, Sen. DanQuayle of Indiana, for opposing legislation that would requireemployers to give workers 60 days' notice of mass layoffs or plantclosings.   The Democratic nominee, struggling to reverse his slide in thepolls in the nation's industrial heartland, cloaked himself in thememory of Harry Truman's upset victory over Republican Thomas E.Dewey in 1948.   ``Harry Truman was a fighter and so am I,'' Dukakis said. ``Myfriends, this election is up for grabs.''   From Evergreen Park, he headed for Rockford in northern Illinoisand was ending the day with a town meeting in Independence, Mo.,Truman's birthplace. Dukakis also was appearing on the CBS EveningNews tonight.   At a town meeting Monday night in the Chicago suburb ofNaperaville, Dukakis delivered a broad swipe Monday at what hecalled Bush's nasty campaigning and distortions of his positions ondefense, the environment, crime and gun controls. The session wasbroadcast nationally on the C-SPAN cable TV network.   ``This is not a campaign about furloughs and flag factories,''Dukakis said at a high school in this Chicago suburb. ``This is acampaign about the future of America. And especially about youngpeople.''   He also sought to lay claim to the high ground in the campaign, aposition Dukakis hopes will sway undecided and soft Bush supportersin the 12 days before the election.   ``I don't think politics ought to be an enterprise in which allwe do is cut the other guy up,'' Dukakis said. ``Obviously, Mr. Bushdisagrees. I think it's a disservice to the American people.''   The latest statewide survey in Missouri showed Bush's late Augustnine-point lead cut to one as the vice president led Dukakis 44-43percent, according to today's editions of The Kansas City Times.   The survey of 550 likely voters, conducted Sunday and Monday, hada margin of error of plus or minus four points.   Dukakis has blamed his slide in national polls on a litany ofunfounded GOP allegations left unanswered, but his audience inNaperville and three other cities asked questions that allowedDukakis to respond to the salvos. In addition to the C-Spanbroadcast, the session was shown simultaneously at meetings inRochester, N.Y., Johnstown, Pa., and Green Bay, Wis.   At the Naperville forum, Dukakis said a Bush ad showing Dukakisriding in an Army tank misrepresented his position on severalweapons systems and also accused the vice president of proving helacked leaderhip credentials by failing to outline weapons systemshe would select at a time when both candidates project stabledefense spending.   ``Mr. Bush has never met a weapons system he didn't like,''Dukakis said.   In an interview with The Washington Post, published in today'seditions, Dukakis conceded that he may have erred at the DemocraticNational Convention when he said, ``this campaign is not aboutideology _ it's about competence.''   The Democratic nominee said that he might have used his firstspeech to a national audience to lay out ``values and philosophy ...fundamental differences between me and George Bush.''   ``Should the speech in Atlanta have been more explicit, more of astatement of philosophy, positions?'' he said. ``Perhaps.''   At a rowdy noontime rally Wednesday in Pueblo, Colo., Dukakisalso accused the National Rifle Association of distoring hisposition on gun control.   Dukakis said he supported the rights of hunters and sportsmen toown guns and for homeowners to purchase guns to protect their homes.   He then chided Bush for not taking a position on legislation toprovide a seven-day waiting period to allow police to conductbackground checks before approving gun sales.</TEXT></DOC>
