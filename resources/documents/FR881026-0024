Before taking action on these recommendedchanges, the Commission requests comments from the public about them.The Federal Trade Commission originally issued the Guide to help businessescomply with Sections 2(d) and (e) of the Robinson-Patman Act (``R-P'' orthe ``Act''). According to the FTC staff, the proposed changes have twoprincipal purposes: first, to clarify and correct the Guides and bringthem into line with developments in the law and in enforcement policy sincetheir last revision; and second, to eliminate requirements that appearto be necessary and in many instances to lack legal support. The Commission would welcome comments from the public concerning the changesto the Guides proposed by the FTC staff, proposals for any further changesto the Guides, and, more generally, the usefulness of the Guides, bothin their current form and in the form proposed by staff. In addition tocomments on the changes proposed by staff, the Commission invities thepublic to address other issues.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before January 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should be addressed to the Secretary, FederalTrade Commission, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington,DC 20580.

Before taking actionon these recommended changes, the Commission requests comments from thepublic about them. The Commission also invites the public to address thefollowing general questions:(I) Do the existing Guides serve any useful purpose?(II) Would the public interest be advanced if the Commission left the currentGuides as they are without any changes?(III) Would the public interest be advanced if the Commission simply withdrawthe current Guides?(IV) Would any changes to the Guides in addition to those proposed by staffbe in the public interest?Although revised guides published here do not include the following changes,such changes have been occasionally suggested as desirable, and commentson these ideas would be welcomed:(A) Defining proportional equality in terms of the amount of effectivepromotional services received per dollar of promotional expenditure bythe seller.(B) Permitting sellers to proportionalize promotional services to differentcustomers as well as for different media, provided that they have reliableevidence showing that such differences are justified by differences inthe amount of effective promotional services being acquired or provided.(C) Using evidence about the competitive conditions of the buying and sellingsides of the market in which promotional services and allowances are grantedto help in the assessment of whether the proportional equality requirementis satisfied.With regard to each of these suggestions, the Commission would welcomepublic response to the following questions:(1) What would be the predictable practical effects of the proposed change?(2) Would economic efficiency and consumer welfare predictably be advancedby the proposed change?(3) Is the proposed change consistent with the language of the Act andits legislative history?(4) Would the proposed change be precluded by any controlling case law?Set forth below is the staff's explanation of the proposed changes.Sections 2(d) and (e) of R-P prohibit a seller from paying allowances orfurnishing services to promote the resale of its products unless the allowancesor services are offered to all competing customers on proportionally equalterms. Sections 2(d) and (e) apply only to allowances or services designedprimarily to stimulate resale. If a discrimination principally relatesto the original sale from seller to buyer, it is subject to section 2(a)of R-P, not sections 2(d) or (e). This differentiation has important consequences.In contrast to a Section 2(a) violation, a plaintiff need not demonstrateadverse competitive effects to establish a section 2(d) or (e) violation,and although meeting competition is a defense, cost justification is not.The primary purpose of the Guides is to provide assistance to businessesseeking to comply with sections 2(d) and (e). Private attorneys specializingin R-P practice have told Commission staff that the Guides continue tobe widely used, particularly by in-house counsel. Many of the latter reportedlyfollow the Guides closely to minimize the possibility of private trebledamage actions. Because of this substantial reliance, the Commission staffbelieves it is important that the Guides are accurate and not unnecessarilyrestrictive.Because of changes in the law since the Guides were last amended, someGuide provisions do not reflect current law. The Supreme Court's decisionin <T3>Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverages, Inc., </T3>460 U.S.428 (1983), has rendered obsolete significant portions of the Guides' discussionof the meeting competition defense. Further, the relevant Guide provisionsdo not stress the resale requirement of sections 2(d) and (e), in contrastto such recent decisions as <T3>Bouldis v. U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp.,</T3> 711 F.2d 1319 (6th Cir. 1983);<T3>Landamp;L Oil Co. v. Murphy Oil Corp., </T3>674 F.2d 1113 (5th Cir. 1982);and <T3>Herbert R. Gibson, Sr., </T3>95 F.T.C. 553 (1980), <T3>aff'd,</T3> 682 F.2d 554 (5th Cir. 1982), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>460 U.S. 1068 (1983). Further, the Guides' <T3>per se </T3> condemnation of price restrictions on co-op advertisingallowances has been undercut by the rule of reason approaches of <T3>In re Nissan Antitrust Litig</T3>., 577 F.2d 910 (5th Cir. 1978), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>439 U.S. 1072 (1979); <T3>AAA Liquors Inc. v. Joseph E. Seagram andamp; Son, </T3>705 F.2d 1203(10th Cir. 1982), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>461 U.S. 927 (1983); and <T3>Jack Walters andamp; Sons Corp. v. Morton Bldg., Inc., </T3>737 F.2d698 (7th Cir. 1984), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>469 U.S. 1018 (1984).Some Guide provisions have been criticized as unnecessarily restrictive,particularly the Guides' use of customer cost as the basis for proportionalizingpromotional offers. A cost-based standard means, for example, that a sellerwould reimburse customer expenditures on different promotional activitiesat the same percentage of each customer's cost, although the effectivenessof the different promotional services, in generating increased demand forthe seller's product, might be different. That result, by tending to suppressdifferences in productivity, might reduce promotional efficiency. Althoughthe proposed revisions do not reflect these criticisms, comment on thegeneral issue is invited.Finally, the revisions are designed to bring the Guides into line withthe many R-P cases indicating that, where possible, the Act should be construedto promote the procompetitive goals of the other antitrust laws. <T3>See, eg., Automatic Canteen Co. v. F.T.C., </T3>346 U.S. 61 (1953);<T3>Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. v. F.T.C., </T3>440 U.S. 69 (1979);<T3>O. Hommel Co. v. Ferro Corp., </T3>659 F.2d 340 (3d Cir. 1981), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>455 U.S. 1017 (1982); <T3>General Motors Corp., </T3>103 F.T.C. 641 (1984); <T3>Boise Cascade Corporation, </T3>107 F.T.C. 76 (1986), <T3>remanded</T3>, 837 F.2d 1127 (D.C.Cir. 1988). In <T3>Aandamp;P, </T3>the Court considered whether a buyer had a duty underR-P to inform a prospective seller that its bid was substantially lowerthan a rival's offer. The Court refused to impose such a duty, in partbecause it would conflict with the Sherman Act's goal of greater pricecompetition. The Court observed: ``Imposition of Section 2(f) liabilityon the buyer in this case would lead to * * * price uniformity and rigidity.''440 U.S. at 80. Consistent with this reasoning, the proposed revisionsare intended to make the Guides more procompetitive as well as more accurate.This section discusses revisions in the order they would appear in theGuides. Following this explanatory section is the full text of the revisedGuides, as they would appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. It shouldbe noted that although the Guides appear in the Code of Federal Regulationsand, for simplicity, the following explanation sometimes refers to Guide``requirements,'' the Guides are purely advisory; they are not bindingregulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose of the Guides</ITAG>The revised Guides contain a new Guide One which states the purpose ofthe Guides. The existing Guides discuss the reason for their promulgationin their Introduction, which does not appear in the CFR. The Commissionstaff believes it important that there be the widest possible disseminationof the Guides' purpose and, therefore, has included this as a separateGuide which will be published in the CFR.The Commission staff hopes that the Guides will provide assistance to businessesseeking to comply with sections 2(d) and (e) of R-P. The Guides thereforeseek not only to give interpretations based on controlling case law butalso to giver guidance in those areas not illuminated by cases. The Commissionstaff's interpretations in these latter areas, however, are believed tobe consistent with section 2(d) and (e) language and grounded in theirlegislative history.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definition of Customer</ITAG>There are two proposed revisions to existing Guide 3 (``Who is a customer?''),now renumbered as Guide 4. The first would amend Example 2 by making clearthat the promotional plan concerns services to be performed at the retaillevel and that the context for the competing customer determination inthat example is a retailer-oriented promotion.The second revision would remove Example 3 from existing Guide 8 and placeit under revised Guide 4. Example 3 basically parallels Example 2 of revisedGuide 4, except that it describes a promotion directed to wholesalers.The juxtaposition of these two examples should bring out more clearly thatcustomer determination depends on the level (or levels) of distributiontargeted by a seller's promotion.<ITAG tagnum="84">Competing Customers</ITAG>The next revision essentially shifts existing Guide 12 (``Competing customers'')to a renumbered Guide 5. The Commission staff believes this enables thereader more easily to assimilate the companion concepts of customer andcompeting customer by successively discussing them. In addition to therepositioning, the revisions delete the reference to the seller's potentialliability under section 2(a) or R-P or section 5 of the FTC Act. Severalpeople said that the reference confused rather than enlightened their clients.The Commission staff believes that the continued inclusion of the referenceserves little or no purpose and its exclusion may give greater claritybased on the cited comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interstate Commerce</ITAG>The proposed revision to Guide 4 (``What is interstate commerce?''), nowrenumbered Guide 6, states that the commerce requirement of sections 2(d) and (e) is basically the same as the commerce requirement of section2(a). The earlier case of <T3>Shreveport Macaroni Manufacturing Co. v. F.T.C., </T3>321 F.2d 404(5th Cir. 1963), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>375 U.S. 971 (1964), appeared to distinguish therequirements. Two recent cases, however, have indicated that the jurisdictionallimitation is essentially the same for all three sections. <T3>See Landamp;L Oil Co., Inc. v. Murphy Oil Corp., </T3>674 F.2d at 1113;<T3>Zoslaw v. MCA Distributing Corp., </T3>693 F.2d 870 (9th Cir. 1982),<T3>cert. denied, </T3>460 U.S. 1085 (1983). Further, there appears tobe no compelling reason to differentiate the jurisdictional requirementsin various sections of the same act. Accordingly, the proposed languagegives a general description of the commerce requirement applicable to Sections2(a), 2(d) and 2(e).<ITAG tagnum="84">Services or Facilities</ITAG>The proposed amendments to Guide 5 (``What are services or facilities?''),now renumbered Guide 7, would emphasize the resale requirement of sections2 (d) and (e) by adding general language highlighting the requirement andby eliminating overlapping examples listed in existing Guide 5. Moreover,two examples which have been deleted_those concerning the provision ofspecial packaging or package sizes, and the acceptance of returns for credit_seemunlikely to satisfy the resale test as currently interpreted.Two early Commission decisions, <T3>Luxor, Ltd., </T3>31 F.T.C. 658 (1940), and <T3>General Foods Corp., </T3>52 F.T.C. 798 (1956), apply section 2(e)to special packaging. The latter case simply relies on the former, however,and its analysis of the issue is brief and conclusory. Recent Commissiondecisions (not involving special packaging) have interpreted the resalerequirement of sections 2 (d) and (e) more strictly. Compare <T3>Gibson, </T3>95 F.T.C. at 724-30 with <T3>Alterman Foods, </T3>82 F.T.C. 298, 343 (1973); <T3>see also General Motors, </T3>103 F.T.C. at 641. These decisions areconsistent with recent appellate court opinions emphasizing the resalerequirement. <T3>See Bouldis v. U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp., </T3>711 F.2d 1319, 1328 (6thCir. 1983); <T3>Rutledge v. Electric Hose andamp; Rubber Co., </T3>511 F.2d 668, 678(9th Cir. 1975); <T3>Kirby v. P.R. Mallory andamp; Co., </T3>489 F.2d 904, 910 (7th Cir. 1973),<T3>cert. denied, </T3>417 U.S. 911 (1974).Similarly, one early Commission decision, <T3>Joseph A. Kaplan andamp; Sons, </T3>63 F.T.C. 1308 (1963), <T3>aff'd in part and modified in part on other grounds, </T3>347 F. 2d785 (D.C. Cir. 1965), holds that accepting returns for credit is coveredby Section 2(e). However, the analysis on this point was perfunctory andcontrary to the thrust of later Commission and judicial decisions. Indeed,the Sixth Circuit recently declined to apply <T3>Kaplan </T3>to the facts in <T3>Bouldis v. U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp., </T3>711 F.2d at 1328.In light of the unmistakable trend in the case law toward a stricter interpretationof the resale requirement, the Commission staff believes it would be misleadingto cite special packaging and accepting returns for credit as examplesof services that meet this requirement. Although these two services maysometimes satisfy the resale test, it seems likely that these servicesare often offered to particular customers primarily to promote the originalsale. These services, moreover, do not possess the close and obvious connectionto resale of the other examples cited (<T3>e.g., </T3>demonstrators, display materials). Unless public commentsprovide substantial evidence of the requisite resale nexus, it appearsto be clearer to treat each of these services as one of the situationsthat the Guides do not usually cover.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proportional Equality</ITAG>Proposed Guide 8, dealing with proportional equality, is substantiallythe same as existing Guide 7, with the addition of a new paragraph explaininghow proportional equality does not require mathematical precision or absolutelyuniform treatment.Sections 2(d) and (e) require that promotional allowances and servicesbe made available to all competing customers on ``proportionally equal''terms. In accordance with the case law, the Guide notes that ``[n]o singleway to proportionalize is prescribed by law.'' The Guides have been readto require that the seller use cost, independent of the effectiveness ofthe promotional services supplied or acquired, as the sole basis for proportionalizingoffers among customers. Cost has been considered in essentially two ways:first, that the seller must spend or supply an equal amount for promotionalpurposes per unit sold to its competing customers; alternatively, thatit must spend an amount that bears an equal proportion of its customers'costs of providing a promotional service. An example of the first wouldbe a promotional payment that offers each customer 15 cents per unit ofproduct purchased for advertising in newspapers, and if newspapers arenot functionally available to certain customers, by offering them 15 centsper unit for advertising in some alternative way, such as handbills. Anexample of the second would be the seller paying 50 percent of its customers'cost of advertising in some alternative way if newspapers are not functionallyavailable to some of them.The proposed revisions would not change the language of the existing Guidesin this respect. The Commission is interested in comments on whether theGuides should be revised to make it clear that a seller could vary itsallowances or services to reflect differences in value to the seller. Forexample, should the Guides permit a seller to offer an allowance of $200to customer A because A will use the allowance for promotions worth $200to the seller (in terms of the number of potential customers reached),but also permit the seller to pay only $100 to customer B_who buys as muchof the seller's product as customer A does, and uses the same promotionalmedium as A, at the same cost_because the result of B's effort is onlyworth $100 to the seller? This result might be a more economically efficientallocation of resources to promotional activity than requiring the sellerto pay the same amount to each customer, or requiring the seller to paytheir actual costs; however, is this result consistent with the Act?The Act's legislative history indicates that the term ``proportional equality''was intended to provide the measure by which a seller could provide promotionalservices or allowances to both its large and small customers on a basiswhich would not disproportionally favor the large customers over the smallcustomers. Mr. Teegarden, counsel for the organized wholesale grocers andthe draftsman of the Patman bill, stated that ``proportional equality''would ``depend upon such factors as the nature of the services or facilitiesfor which it is offered and the ability of the competitor to furnish suchservices or facilities with corresponding value in proportion to the smallerquantities which he might be able to furnish them.'' \1\<NOTE/> Similarly, the Senate and House Judiciary Committee Reportsboth stated that the phrase ``proportionally equal terms'' was:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Hearings Before the House Committee on the Judiciary onBills to Amend the Clayton Act, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., at 38 (1935). Mr.Teegarden also considered it obvious that the seller would make paymentsonly to ``those customers able to furnish the services or facilities forwhich they are offered.'' <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="20">designed to prevent the limitation of such allowances to single customerson the ground that they alone can furnish the services or facilities inthe quantity specified. Where a competitor can furnish them in less quantity,but of the same relative value, he seems entitled, and this clause is designedto accord him, the right to a similar allowance commensurate with thosefacilities. To illustrate: Where . . . a manufacturer grants to a particularchain distributor an advertising allowance of the stated amount per monthper store in which the former's goods are sold, a competing customer witha smaller number of stores, but equally able to furnish the same serviceper store, and under conditions of the same value to the seller, wouldbe entitled to a similar allowance on that basis.\2\</ITAG><NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ S. Rep. No. 1502, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., at 8 (1936); H.R.Rep. No. 2287, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., at 16 (1936). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Similarly, Representative Utterback's explanation of the ConferenceReport related proportional equality ``naturally to those customers' purchasesand to their ability to render the services and facilities to be paid for.''\3\<NOTE/> The legislative history makes clear that the seller's-coststandard was intended to be a means of determining proportional equality.For example, Senator Logan, the Senate Manager of the Patman bill, explainedthe concept of ``proportional equality'' on this basis: ``If one man buys$100,000 in goods and should be allowed $1,000 for advertising purposes,and another buys $10,000 in goods, he ought to be allowed $100 for advertising.''\4\<NOTE/> Is it fair to read the legislative history as permittingdifferent payments for services of different value; or is it more accurateto interpret the statements about services of ``the same relative value''to the seller to be assertions that the services of different customers,compensated on a sellers-cost basis, would necessarily be of the same value?<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 80 Cong. Rec. 9416 (1936).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 80 Cong. Rec. 3116 (1936).The relevant cases are few. Compare <T3>Lever Brothers Co.,</T3> 50 F.T.C. 494 (1953), in which the Commissionsuggested that either cost or value could be used to measure proportionalequality, with <T3>F.T.C. v. Simplicity Pattern Co.,</T3> 360 U.S. 55, 61 (1959), endorsingthe ``relatively broad scope'' the Commission had given to the standardof proportional equality, and <T3>Colonial Stores,</T3> 450 F.2d 733, 743, note 23 (5th Cir. 1971), holdingthat <T3>Lever Brothers</T3> did not permit a seller to make a grossly disproportionateoffer to a single, large customer and attempt to justify the disparityon the gound that the customer's service was uniquely valuable.There are three other proposed revisions in existing Guides 7 and 9, theformer renumbered as revised Guide 8. The first is a clarification of existinglanguage which would remove the implication in paragraph 2 of existingGuide 9 that each alternative promotional plan must be suitable for allcompeting customers. The purpose of requiring alternatives is to give competingcustomers who cannot provide or use particular media or services a practicalalternative. It is necessary and may be counterproductive to require thatthe alternatives simultaneously be suitable for all customers.The second change is more significant and relates to the elimination offootnote 2 to existing Guide 9, the last sentence of which reads in pertinentpart: ``Also, the purchase of displays or shelf space whether directlyor by means of so-called allowances, may be considered an `unfair methodof competition' * * *'' This statement implies that the purchase of storespace is suspect. However, in <T3>Hastings Manufacturing Co.,</T3> Dkt. No. 4437, [1979-1983 TransferBinder] Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) Para. 21,646 (order modification), the Commissionrecognized that bidding for shelf space is a form of price competition,generally beneficial for the consumer. Additionally, in <T3>Bayou Bottling, Inc. v. Dr. Pepper Co.,</T3> 725 F.2d 300 (5th Cir.1984), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 469 U.S. (1984), the Fifth Circuit concluded thatshelf space monopolization was unlikely. Noting that retailers generallyallocated shelf space in proportion to market activity, the court saw littledanger that space would be dominated by one seller.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cooperative Advertising and Suggested Resale Prices </ITAG>The final proposed revision to existing Guide 7 would delete Example 8.This example states that a seller should not refuse to reimburse a customerfor expenditures on cooperative advertisement because it features a priceother than the seller's suggested price. The Commission reiterated thisview in a 1980 enforcement policy statement which maintained that it is<T3>per se </T3>illegal for a manufacturer to enter into a cooperativeadvertising agreement that denies payments when the dealer advertises adiscount price or a price less than the one suggested. <T3>See F.T.C. Policy Statement Regarding Price Restrictions in AdvertisingPrograms, </T3>4 Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) Para. 30,057 (October 26, 1981).The Commission has now rescinded this policy statement because it applieda broad <T3>per se </T3>rule to a practice that should generally be evaluated underthe rule of reason. Consistent with this action, the Commission staff proposesto delete Example 8.The only appellate decision on point supports this course of action. In<T3>In re Nissan Antitrust Litig., </T3>577 F.2d 910 (1978), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>439 U.S. 1072 (1979), the Fifth Circuit revieweda cooperative advertising plan that limited reimbursements to advertisementsthat contained Nissan's suggested price (or no price at all). The plan'simpact on price was limited: Retailers could advertise other prices attheir own expense and could (and did) sell cars at different prices. Moreover,by encouraging dealer promotion and investment, the plan may have helpedNissan penetrate a market dominated by domestic producers. The trial judgehad therefore rejected a jury instruction that the plan was <T3>per se </T3>illegal. The Fifth Circuit upheld this decision and leftstanding the jury verdict for Nissan. This case was decided after the Guides were issued but before the issuanceof the Commission policy statement. Cases subsequent to the policy statementhave all supported the rule of reason approach of <T3>Nissan </T3>rather than the <T3>per se </T3>approach of the policy statement. These cases are not directlyon point: They do not involve cooperative advertising and they addressmanufacturer efforts to hold down, not support, dealer prices. On the otherhand, the cases exhibit a considerable reluctance to expand the <T3>per se </T3>rule against vertical price fixing. All sustain limited,<T3>direct</T3> restraints on resale prices, in contract to the <T3>indirect </T3>influence on these prices exerted by restrictions oncooperative advertising. Further, in allowing manufacturers to hold downdealer prices, the decisions undercut Example 8 and the 1980 statementto the extent they indicate that a manufacturer cannot condition cooperativeadvertising payments on a dealer's agreement not to advertise prices <T3>above </T3>the suggested prices. In <T3>AAA Liquors, Inc. v. Joseph. E. Seagram andamp; Sons, </T3>705 F.2d 1203(10th Cir. 1982), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>461 U.S. 927 (1983), Seagram wished to help itsretailers in Denver meet strong price competition. The company thereforegave price discounts to its wholesalers and required that they be passedon to retailers. The Tenth Circuit held that this price constraint wasneither <T3>per se </T3>illegal nor unreasonable. Two other Circuits have followed the lead of the Tenth Circuit. In <T3>Lewis Service Center, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., </T3>714 F.2d 842(1983), <T3>Cert. denied, </T3>467 U.S. 1226 (1984), the Eighth Circuit found noantitrust violation where Mack Truck conditioned its sales assistance programon the maximum price charged by its dealers. The Seventh Circuit held in<T3>Jack Walters andamp; Sons Corp v. Morton Bldg., Inc. </T3>737 F.2d 6(1984), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>469 U.S. 1018 (1984), that a manufacturer couldsecure agreements from its dealers that they would not charge prices higherthan those advertised by the manufacturer. In contrast to these decisions applying the rule of reason, the only casesapplying a <T3>per se </T3>approach to these types of restraints are two older districtcourt opinions; neither clearly involved a pure cooperative advertisingprice restriction. In <T3>United States v. Serta Assocs., Inc., </T3>296 F. Supp. 1121 (N.D.Ill.1968), <T3>aff'd per curiam, </T3>393 U.S. 534 (1969), the court found a horizontalcartel which, among other things, imposed restrictions on all advertisedprices, not just those in cooperative advertisements. The co-op price restraintswere ancillary to this broader scheme. In <T3>Mt. Vernon Sundat v. Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., </T3>1976-1 TradeCas. (CCH) Para. 60,842 (E.D. Va. 1976), the court cited evidence thatNissan had strongly recommended that dealers adhere to its suggested prices.These efforts may well have constituted a vertical price fixing conspiracyunder the law prevailing then. Consequently both cases involved cooperativeadvertising price restrictions that were either clearly or arguably ancillaryto direct price fixing agreements. Additionally, two consent decrees obtained by the Department of Justiceand three consent order secured by the Commission took the position thatthe denial of cooperative advertising payments to dealers not using themanufacturer's suggested price constituted vertical price fixing. <T3>See United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., </T3>1980-81Trade Cas., (CCH) Para. 63,570 (N.D. Ohio 1980); <T3>United States v. Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., </T3>1973 Trade Cas.(CCH) Para. 74,333 (N.D. Cal. 1973); <T3>Tingley Rubber Corp., </T3>96 F.T.C. 340 (1980); <T3>Totes, Inc., </T3>96 F.T.C. 335 (1980); <T3>Advertising Checking Bureau, Inc., </T3>93 F.T.C. 4 (1979). As consentdecrees, however, none of these orders amounted to a judicial determinationof the issue. In sum, there is little judicial support for the view that price restrictionson cooperative advertising, standing alone, are <T3>per se </T3>illegal. Moreover, there is considerable precedent to thecontrary. <ITAG tagnum="84">Availability and Notification</ITAG>The proposed revisions in this category relate to the seller's responsibilitiesto notify all competing customers of its promotional programs (existingGuide 8). Provisions dealing with this notification responsibility arescattered in existing Guides 6, 8, and 10. The revisions combine them allas part of revised Guide 9, which sets forth the twin aspects of availability:(1) The functional availability of the promotion to all competing customers;and (2) the communication of its existence.Existing Guide 8 indicates that the seller has essentially two notificationresponsibilities: (1) To implement a ``procedure reasonably designed toinform all his competing customers of his promotional programs;'' and (2)to ``verify the effectiveness'' of this procedure by (a) making ``spotchecks'' at least every 90 days of ``a representative cross section ofhis indirect-buying customers,'' and (b) altering notification proceduresappropriately if a spot check indicates that some customers are not receivingnotice.The Commission staff proposes to modify Guide 8 by eliminating the 90-dayspot check requirement. This requirement appears overly regulatory andinsufficiently cost conscious. Checking a representative cross sectionof indirect customers every 90 days is likely to be expensive for manysellers and usually not warranted. A seller that follows revised Guide9 will already be using procedures reasonably designed to inform competingcustomers of promotional programs. In such cases, the self-interest ofsellers and customers (which are generally aware that sellers offer promotionalallowances and which do not want to miss specific offers) should causemost buyers to receive notice.The Commission staff has also recommended deleting existing Guides 6 (``Needfor a plan'') and 10 (``Need to understand terms'') from the revised Guides.These two existing Guides seem generally redundant. For example, Subsection(b) of existing Guide 6 states that a seller should inform its competingcustomers of the terms of its promotions. It is not clear what this addsto existing Guide 8 which goes into some detail as to the seller's notificationobligation. Similarly, Subsection (a) of existing Guide 6 merely restatesthe existing Guide 7 stricutre that a plan should be available on proportionallyequal terms to all competing customers, as does Subsection (e), statingthat a seller should not overpay customers for promotional services supplied.Existing Guide 10 adds to this reiteration by counseling that sellers shouldinform competing customers in understandable terms of their promotions,a concept implicit, if not explicit, in revised Guide 9. The Commissionstaff believes this repetition is not informative. For these reasons, therevisions eliminate existing Guides 6 and 10.The revisions revise and renumber existing Guide 13 (``Wholesaler or thirdparty performance of seller's obligations''). Revised Guide 10 now dealswith the seller's use of wholesalers or other third parties for performanceof the seller's obligations. The thrust of existing Guide 13 is that nomatter how a seller contracts with a third party to carry out its dutiesunder the law, the seller remains liable for any infractions. Revised Guide10 makes this point and eliminates the regulatory detail of existing Guide13.<ITAG tagnum="84">Customer's Liability</ITAG>Existing Guide 14, now renumbered as Guide 11, dealing with customer liabilityunder section 5 of the FTC Act is substantially unchanged. The exampleshave been edited to emphasize the scienter requirement, that the customer``knows or should know'' that allowances or services received are not availableon proportionally equal terms to competitors. In addition, existing Guide15, which deals with third-party liability under Section 5 of the FederalTrade Commission Act for furnishing a customer fictitious billing, is combinedwith this Guide.<ITAG tagnum="84">Meeting Competition</ITAG>Existing Guide 16, renumbered as revised Guide 12, briefly describes themeeting competition defense to sections 2(d) and (e). The proposed revisionswould replace most of the existing paragraph with new language that reflectsthe Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Falls City Industries, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Vanco Beverage, Inc., </T3>460 U.S. 428 (1983), and <T3>Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. </T3>v. <T3>F.T.C., </T3>440 U.S. 69 (1979). For example, the proposed languagewould drop the existing Guide's emphasis on offers to a ``particular customer''and state instead that the defense is applicable to area-wide offers. In<T3>Falls City, </T3>the Court declared:<ITAG tagnum="21">There is no evidence that Congress intended to limit the availabilityof [the meeting competition defense] to customer-specific responses. .. . Congress intended to allow reasonable pricing responses on an area-specificbasis where competitive circumstances warrant them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20"/><T3>Id</T3>. at 448.Similarly, existing Guide 16 implies that the defense is available onlyif the seller's promotional payments meet ``equally high'' payments bya competitor. Such a matching requirement, however, would conflict withthe exculpation of the seller in <T3>Aandamp;P. </T3>There, the Court held that seller had a meeting competitiondefense even though his offer beat, rather than simply matched, the competingoffer. Further, the last sentence of the existing Guide, although correctif read narrowly, may imply to some readers that the defense is unavailableeven though the seller has a reasonable belief that it will lose the customer'sbusiness if it does not improve its offer. The revised Guide, which stressesthe good faith requirements, should avoid this misreading.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 240</ITAG>Robinson-Patman Act, Promotional allowances and services.<ITAG tagnum="21">By Direction of the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.

The Commission's interpretations are based on the languageof the statute, the legislative history, administrative and court decisions,and an evaluation of the purposes of the relevant statutory provisions.Although the Commission has concluded that its interpretations are consistentwith all controlling case law, the Commission has sought to provide guidancein some areas where no definitive guidance is provided by the case law.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 240.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability of the Law.</ITAG>The substantive provisions of sections 2(d) and (e) apply only under certaincircumstances.(a) Section 2(d) applies only to:(1) A seller of products;(2) Engaged in interstate commerce:(3) That either directly or through an intermediary;(4) Pays a customer for promotional services or facilities provided bysaid customer;(5) In connection with the <T3>resale </T3>(not the initial sale between the seller and the customer)of the seller's products;(6) Where the customer is engaged in competition with one or more of theseller's other customers also engaged in the resale of the seller's productsof like grade and quality.(b) Section 2(e) applies only to:(1) A seller of products;(2) Engaged in interstate commerce;(3) That either directly or through an intermediary;(4) Furnishes promotional services or facilities to a customer;(5) In connection with the <T3>resale </T3>(not the initial sale between the seller and the customer)of the seller's products;(6) Where the customer is engaged in competition with one or more of theseller's other customers also engaged in the resale of the seller's productsof like grade and quality.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Additionally, section 5 of the FTC Act may apply to buyers of productsfor resale engaged in interstate commerce, or to third parties, as outlinedin andSection; 240.11 of these Guides.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 240.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definition of Seller.</ITAG>``Seller'' includes any business (manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor,etc.) that sells products for resale, with or without further processing.For example, selling candy to a retailer is a sale for resale without processing.Selling corn syrup to a candy manufacturer is a sale for resale with processing.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 240.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definition of Customer.</ITAG>A ``customer'' is any business that buys for resale directly from the seller,or the seller's agent or broker. In addition, a ``customer'' is any buyerof the seller's product for resale that purchases from or through a wholesaleror other intermediate reseller. The word ``customer'' which is used inSection 2(d) of the Act includes ``purchaser'' which is used in Section2(e).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:_</T4>The Commission recognizes some exceptions to this generaldefinition of ``customer.'' For example, the purchaser of distressed merchandisewould not be considered a ``customer'' simply on the basis of such purchase.Similarly, a retailer purchasing solely from other retailers, or makingsporadic purchases, or one that does not regularly sell the seller's product,or that is a type of retail outlet not usually selling such products (e.g.,a hardware store stocking a few isolated food items) will not be considereda ``customer'' of the seller unless the seller has been put on notice thatsuch retailer is selling its product.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1: </T3>A manufacturer sells to some retailers directly andto others through wholesalers. Retailer A purchases the manufacturer'sproduct from a wholesaler and resells some of it to Retailer B. RetailerA is a customer of the manufacturer. Retailer B is not a customer unlessthe fact that it purchases the manufacturer's product is known to the manufacturer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2: </T3>A manufacturer sells directly to some independent retailers,to the headquarters of chains and of retailer-owned coooperatives, andto wholesalers. The manufacturer offers promotional services or allowancesfor promotional activity to be performed at the retail level. With respectto such services and allowances, the direct-buying independent retailers,the headquarters of the chains and retailer-owned cooperatives, and thewholesalers' independent retailer customers are customers of the manufacturer.Individual retail outlets of the chains and the memers of the retailer-ownedcooperatives are not customers of the manufacturer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3: </T3>A seller offers to pay wholesalers to advertise theseller's product in the wholesalers' order books or in the wholesalers'price lists directed to retailers purchasing from the wholesalers. Thewholesalers are customers but the retailers purchasing from the wholesalersand reached by the wholesalers' advertisements are not customers for purposesof this promotion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 240.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definition of Competing Customers.</ITAG>``Competing customers'' are all businesses that compete in the resale ofthe seller's products of like grade and quality at the same functionallevel of distribution regardless of whether they purchase directly fromthe seller or through some intermediary.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1: </T3>Manufacturer A, located in Wisconsin and distributingshoes nationally, sells shoes to three competing retailers that sell onlyin the Roanoke, Virginia area. Manufacturer A has no other customers sellingin Roanoke or its vicinity. If Manufacturer A offers its promotion to oneRoanoke customer, it should include all three, but it can limit it to them.The trade area should not be drawn arbitrarily so as to exclude competingretailers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2: </T3>A national seller has direct-buying retailing customersreselling exclusively within the Baltimore City trade area, and other customerswithin that area purchasing through wholesalers. The seller may lawfullyengage in a promotional campaign confined to the Baltimore City trade area,provided it affords all of its retailing customers within the area theopportunity to participate, including those that purchase through wholesalers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 240.6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Interstate Commerce.</ITAG>This term has not been precisely defined in the statute. In general, thecommerce requirement for sections 2(d) and (e) is the same as the commercerequirement for section 2(a). For a discrimination in price or promotionalterms to be subject to the Act, at least one of the sales involved in aprice discrimination, or shipments to at least one of the customers affectedby the promotional discrimination, must cross a state line. Sales or promotionaloffers within the District of Columbia and most United States possessionsare also covered by the Act.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 240.7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Services or Facilities.</ITAG>These terms have not been exactly defined by the statute or in decisions.One requirement, however, is that the services or facilities be intendedprimarily to promote the resale of the seller's product by the customer.Services or facilities that relate primarily to the original sale are coveredby section 2(a). The following list provides some examples_the list isnot exhaustive_of promotional services and facilities covered by sections2(d) and (e):(a) Cooperative advertising;(b) Handbills;(c) Demonstrators and demonstrations;(d) Catalogues;(e) Storage cabinets;(f) Dispaly materials;(g) Prizes or merchandise for conducting promotional contests.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 240.8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Proportionally Equal Terms.</ITAG>The promotional services and allowances should be made available to allcompeting customers on proportionally equal terms. This means that paymentsor services should be proportionalized on some basis that is fair to allcustomers who compete in the resale of the seller's products. No singleway to proportionalize is prescribed by law. Any method that treats competingcustomers on proportionally equal terms may be used. Generally, this canbest be done by basing the payments made or the services furnished on thedollar volume or on the quantity of goods purchased during a specifiedperiod. Other methods that are fair to all competing customers are alsoacceptable. When a seller offers more than one type of service, or paymentsfor more than one type of service, all the services or payments shouldbe offered on proportionally equal terms. The seller may do this by offeringall the payments or services at the same rate per unit or amount purchased.Thus, a seller might offer promotional allowances of up to 12 cents a casepurchased for expenditures on either newspaper advertising or handbills.Mathematical precision is not required for sellers to satisfy the standardof proportional equality. Nevertheless, sellers should have a reasonablebasis for the method of proportionality they use. The seller should beprepared to show that it has not engaged in discrimination if it offersdifferent services or allowances for promotions in different media or todifferent customers. If different types or groups of customers are offereddifferent services or facilities (or different combinations or levels ofservices or facilities), a difference in participation rates across customertypes or groups does not in itself imply that services or allowances areoffered on proportionally unequal terms. A seller may not vary the rateat which_or limit the customers to whom_a particular service, or paymentsfor a service, is offered, in order to reflect differences in the productivityof individual customers.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1:</T3> A seller may offer to pay a specified part (e.g., 50percent) of the cost of local advertising up to an amount equal to a specifiedpercentage (e.g., 5 percent) of the dollar value of purchase during a specifiedperiod of time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2:</T3> A seller may place in reserve for each customer a specifiedamount of money for each unit purchased, and use it to reimburse thesecustomers for the cost of advertising the seller's product.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3:</T3> A seller should not select one or a few customers toreceive special allowances (e.g., 5 percent of purchases) for promotions,while making allowances only on some lesser basis (e.g., 2 percent) tocustomers who compete with them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 4: </T3> A seller should not provide an allowance (for services)on a basis that has rates graduated with the amount of goods purchased,as, for instance, 1 percent of the first $1,000 purchased per month, 2percent of the second $1,000 per month, and 3 percent of all over that.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 5:</T3> A seller should not identify or feature one or a fewcustomers in its own advertising without making the same service availableon proportionally equal terms to customers competing with the identifiedcustomer or customers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 6:</T3> A seller who makes employees available or arrangeswith a third party to furnish personnel for purposes of performing workfor a customer should make the same offer available on proportionally equalterms to all other competing customers. In addition, the seller shouldoffer usable and suitable alternatives of equivalent measurable cost tothose competing customers for whom such services are not usable and suitable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 7: </T3>A seller should not offer to pay a straight line ratefor advertising if such payment results in a discrimination between competingcustomers; e.g., the offer of $1.00 per line for advertising in a newspaperthat charges competing customers different amounts for the same advertisingspace. The straight line rate is an acceptable method for allocating advertisingfunds, if the seller offers small retailers that pay more than the lowestnewspaper rate an alternative that enables them to obtain the same percentageof their advertising cost as large retailers. If the $1.00 per line allowanceis based on 50 percent of the newspaper's lowest contract rate of $2.00per line, for example, the seller should offer to pay 50 percent of thenewspaper advertising cost of smaller retailers that establish, by invoiceor otherwise, that they paid more than that contract rate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 204.9 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Availability to All Competing Customers.</ITAG>(a) Functional availability. (1) The seller must take reasonable stepsto ensure that services and facilities are usable in a practical senseby all competing customers. This may require offering alternative termsand conditions under which customers can participate. When a seller providesalternatives in order to meet the availability requirement, it must takereasonable steps to ensure that the alternatives are proportionally equal,but it is not required to offer all alternatives to all competing customers.(2) When a seller offers to competing customers alternative services orallowances that are proportionally equal and at least one such offer isusable in a practical sense by all competing customers, and refrains fromtaking steps to prevent customers from participating, it has satisfiedits obligation to make services and allowances ``functionally available''to all customers. Therefore, the failure of any customer to participatein the program does not place the seller in violation of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1:</T3> A manufacturer offers a plan for cooperative advertisingon radio, TV, or in newspapers of general circulation. Because the purchasesof some of the manufacturer's customers are too small this offer is notusable in a practical sense by them. The manufacturer should offer themalternative(s) on proportionally equal terms that are usable in a practicalsense by them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2: </T3>A seller furnishes demonstrators to large departmentstore customers. The seller should provide alternatives usable in a practicalsense on proportionally equal terms to those competing customers who cannotuse demonstrators. The alternatives may be services usable in a practicalsense that are furnished by the seller, or payments by the seller to customersfor their advertising or promotion of the seller's product.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3:</T3> A seller offers short term displays of varying sizes,including some which are usable by each of its competing customers in apractical business sense. The seller requires uniform, reasonable certificationof performance by each customer. Because they are reluctant to processthe required paper work, some customers do not participate. This fact doesnot place the seller in violation of the functional availability requirementand it is under no obligation to provide additional alternatives.</ITAG>(b) Notice of available services and allowances. The seller has an obligationto take steps reasonably designed to provide notice to competing customersof the availability of promotional services and allowances. Such notificationshould include enough details of the offer in time to enable customersto make an informed judgment whether to participate. When some competingcustomers do not purchase directly from the seller, the seller must takesteps reasonably designed to provide notice to such indirect customers.Acceptable notification may vary. The following is a non-exhaustive listof acceptable methods of notification:(1) When a seller deals directly with competing customers, by providingdirect notice to them;(2) When a promotion consists of providing retailers with display materials,by including the materials within the product shipping container;(3) By including brochures describing the details of the offer in shippingcontainers;(4) By providing information on shipping containers or product packagesof the availability and essential features of an offer, identifying a specificsource for further information;(5) By placing at reasonable intervals in trade publications of generaland widespread distribution announcements of the availability and essentialfeatures of promotional offers, identifying a specific source for furtherinformation; and(6) If the competing customers belong to an identifiable group on a specificmailing list, by providing relevant information of promotional offers tocustomers on that list. For example, if a product is sold lawfully onlyunder government license (alcoholic beverages, etc.), the seller may informonly its customers holding licenses.(c) A seller may contract with intermediaries or other third parties toprovide notice. See andSection; 240.10.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1: </T3>A seller has a plan for the retail promotion of itsproducts in Philadelphia. Some of its retailing customers purchase directlyand it offers the plan to them. Other Philadelphia retailers purchase theseller's products through wholesalers. The seller may use the wholesalersto reach the retailing customers that buy through them, either by havingthe wholesalers notify those retailers, or by using the wholesalers' customerlists for direct notification by the seller.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2:</T3> A seller that sells on a direct basis to some retailersin an area, and to other retailers in the area through wholesalers, hasa plan for the promotion of its products at the retail level. If the sellerdirectly notifies competing direct purchasing retailers, and competingretailers purchasing through the wholesalers, the seller is not requiredto notify its wholesalers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3: </T3>A seller regularly promotes its products at the retaillevel and during the year has various special promotional offers. The seller'scompeting customers include large direct-purchasing retailers and smallerretailers that purchase through wholesalers. The promotions offered canbest be used by the smaller retailers if the funds to which they are entitledare pooled and used by the wholesalers on their behalf (newspaper advertisements,for example). If retailers purchasing through a wholesaler designate thatwholesaler as their agent for receiving notice of, collecting, and usingpromotional allowances for them, the seller may assume that notice of,and payment under, a promotional plan to such wholesaler constitutes noticeand payment to the retailer. The seller must have a reasonable basis forconcluding that the retailers have designated the wholesaler as their agent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 240.10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Wholesaler or Third Party Performance of Seller's Obligations.</ITAG>A seller may contract with intermediaries, such as wholesalers, distributors,or other third parties, for them to perform all or part of the seller'sobligations under Sections 2 (d) and (e). The use of intermediaries doesnot relieve a seller of its responsibility to comply with the law. Therefore,in contracting with an intermediary, a seller should ensure that its obligationsunder the law are in fact fulfilled.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 240.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Customer's and Third Party Liability.</ITAG>(a) Sections 2 (d) and (e) apply to sellers and not to customers. However,a customer who knows, or should know, that it is receiving a discriminatoryprice through services or allowances not made available on proportionallyequal terms to its competitors engaged in the resale of a seller's productmay be proceeded against by the Commission under Section 5 of the FederalTrade Commission Act. Liability for knowingly receiving such a discriminationmay result whether the discrimination takes place directly through paymentsor services, or indirectly through deductions from purchase invoices orother similar means.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1: </T3>A customer should not induce or receive advertisingallowances for special promotion of the seller's products in connectionwith the customer's anniversary sale or new store opening when the customerknows or should know that such allowances, or suitable alternatives, arenot available on proportionally equal terms to all other customers competingwith him in the distribution of the seller's products.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2: </T3>A customer, an experienced buyer, is offered an allowanceof 25 percent of his purchase volume by a seller for cooperative advertisingto be paid for 100 percent by the seller. The customer knows, or shouldknow, that most cooperative advertising programs in the industry allowpayments of from 3 to 7 percent of purchases, and require 50-50 sharingby the seller and the customer. The customer would be on notice to inquireof the seller and to take such other affirmative steps as would satisfya reasonable and prudent businessman that such allowances are affirmativelyoffered and otherwise made available by such seller on proportionally equalterms to all of its other customers competing with the customer in thedistribution of the seller's products.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3:</T3> Frequently the employees of sellers or third partiessuch as brokers perform in-store services for their grocery retailer customerssuch as stocking of shelves, building of displays and checking or rotatinginventory, etc. A customer operating a retail grocery business should notinduce or receive such services when the customer knows or should knowthat such services (or usable and suitable alternative services) are notavailable on proportionally equal terms to all other customers competingwith it in the distribution of the seller's products.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 4:</T3> Where a customer has entered into a contract, understanding,or arrangement for the purchase of advertising with a newspaper or otheradvertising medium which provides for a deterred rebate or other reductionin the price of the advertising, the customer should advise any sellerfrom whom reimbursement for the advertising is claimed that the claimedrate of reimbursement is subject to a deferred rebate or other reductionin price. In the event that any rebate or adjustment in the price is received,the customer should refund to the seller the amount of any excess paymentor allowance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 5:</T3> A customer should not induce or receive an allowancein excess of that offered in the seller's advertising plan by billing theseller at ``vendor rates'' or for any other amount in excess of that authorizedin the seller's promotional program.</ITAG>(b) Third parties, notably advertising media, might also violate section5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act through double or fictitious ratesor billing. An advertising medium, such as a newspaper, broadcast station,or printer of catalogs, that publishes a rate schedule containing fictitiousrates (or rates that are not reasonably expected to be aplicable to a representativenumber of advertisers), or that furnishes a customer with an invoice thatdoes not reflect the customer's actual net advertising cost (or that doesnot clearly state the applicable discounts and rebates) may violate Section5 of the customer uses such deceptive schedule or invoice for a claim foran advertising allowance, payment or credit greater than that to whichit would be entitled under the seller's promotional offering.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1:</T3> A newspaper has a ``national'' rate and a lower ``localrate''. A retailer places an advertisement with the newspaper at the localrate for a product sold by a supplier, from which the retailer will seekreimbursement under the supplier's cooperative advertising plan. The newspapershould not send the retailer two bills, one at the national rate and anotherat the local rate actually charged.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2:</T3> A newspaper has several published rates.

They should therefore portraythe requirements of those sections as accurately as possible. Adoptionby the Commission of the proposed revisions to the Guides would help substantiallyin that regard.Our efforts here should be guided by the pronouncements of the SupremeCourt.

As ageneral proposition, there is little economic justification for regulatingseller offers of services and allowances_or buyer efforts to induce theprovision of services and allowances_when neither sellers nor buyers possesssubstantial market power. Competitive conditions usually ensure that noseller will offer_and no buyer will be able to induce_systematic discrimination,or ``proportionally unequal'' treatment, in any economically meaningfulsense. Unfortunately, sections 2(d) and 2(e) are <T3>per se </T3>prohibitons; no showing of competitive injury is neededto establish seller liability under either section. The American Bar Associcationhas recommended requiring the same showing of competitive injury undersections 2(d) and 2(e) that is currently required to establish liabilityunder section 2(a),\3\<NOTE/> and I support that recommendation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>ABA Favors Competitive Injury Test for Advertising and PromotionalAllowances, </T3>52 Antitrust and Trade Reg. Rep. 357 (Feb. 26, 1987).Unless and until that recommendation is enacted into law, however, theproposed revisions to the Guides offer the best hope of ensuring that sections2(d) and 2(e) are interpreted_by the courts and by the Commission_in aseconomically sensible a manner as possible. I therefore strongly supporttheir adoption. However, I believe that the proposed revisions do not gofar enough. I think at least two other changes_in proposed andSection;andSection;240.11(a)and 240.8 of the Guides_should be made. I have detailed these proposalsin this statement.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Eliminating the Per Se Illegality of Buyer Inducement</ITAG>First, the Commission should eliminate the <T3>per se </T3>illegality of buyer inducement. Sections 2(d) and 2(e)apply only to sellers. The Commission has relied on section 5 of the FederalTrade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, to extend the <T3>per se </T3>standard of seller liability to buyers as well, and thecourts have sustained that extension.\4\<NOTE/> But the fact that the courts have <T3>permitted </T3>the Commission to apply section 5 in this way does notmean that the Commission must or should do so. The Commission has determinedthat section 5 should not be used to prohibit most practices that do notexpressly violate the Robinson-Patman Act unless they actually injure competition.\5\<NOTE/> I think this principle should be used to jettison the conceptof <T3>per se </T3>liability in buyer inducement cases. I therefore proposethat the Commission modify proposed section 240.11(a) of the Guides toread as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See, e.g., Alterman Foods, Inc. v. FTC, </T3>497 F.2d 993, 996-97 (5thCir. 1974); <T3>Grand Union Co. v.

However,under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Commission mayproceed against a customer who knows, or should know, that it is receivinga discriminatory price through services or allowances not made availableon proportionally equal terms to its competitors engaged in the resaleof a seller's product, but only if the provision or receipt of the servicesor allowances at issue injures competition. Establishing injury to competitiontypically will require a showing that the customer possesses substantialmarket power. Liability for knowingly receiving such a discrimination mayresult whether the discrimination takes place directly through paymentsor services, or indirectly through deductions from purchase invoices orother similar means.I would welcome public comment on this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Defining ``Proportional Equality'' in Terms of the Value of Servicesand Allowances to Sellers, and to Reflect Competitive Market Conditions    </ITAG>Second, the definition of ``proportional equality'' in the Guides shouldbe modified so that it is not only consistent with the case law, but alsoas economically sensible as possible. Because the definition of proportionalequality is central to the Guides, I particularly welcome the Commission'sinvitation for the public to comment on these possible changes in thatdefinition:     (A) Defining proportional equality in terms of the amount of effectivepromotional services that a seller receives per dollar of promotional expenditure.    (B) Permitting sellers to vary allowances and services with the identityof the customer, as well as the media used, provided that they have reliableevidence showing that such differences for different customers are justifiedby differences in the amount of effective promotional services that thecustomers provided.     (C) Using evidence about that competitive conditions of the buying andseller sides of the market in which promotional services and allowancesare granted to help in determining whether the proportional equality requirementis satisfied.     I support all three of these proposals.\6\<NOTE/> Sections 2 (d) and (e) require that promotional allowancesand services be made available to all competing customers and on ``proportionallyequal'' terms. In accordance with the case law, existing Guide 7 notesthat ``[n]o single way to proportionalize is prescribed by law.'' However,the 1972 amendments to the Guides nevertheless appear to require_and havewidely been read to require_that the seller use cost <T3>independent </T3>of the effectiveness of the promotional services suppliedor acquired as the sole basis for proportionalizing offers among customers.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ My discussion of these proposals is based in large parton the excellent work done by members of the Commission staff in connectionwith the Guides revision project.   Two approaches to cost have typically been used. Under the first, the sellermust spend or supply an equal amount for promotional purposes per unitsold to each of its competing customers. Under the second approach, theseller must spend an amount that bears an equal proportion of each of itscustomers' costs of providing a promotional service. The Guides are currentlyambiguous as to whether both cost approaches may be usd, but they havebeen interpreted by many as requiring reliance only on the second approach.    The primary problem with both approaches is that they do not focus expresslyon the value to the seller of the promotional services provided. They donot permit the seller to vary its allowances or services to reflect thefact that more expensive services or allowances offered to one customermay be justified, because they are more effective in generating increaseddemand for the seller's product. By contrast, the ``Alternate Section 240.8''that I propose below would define the term ``effective promotional services''to refer to the effectiveness of the promotional services supplied to orprovided by competing customers in generating increased demand for theseller's product.     For example, suppose a seller offers an allowance of $200 to customer Abecause A's use of the allowance for promotional activity in a particularmedium is worth $200 to the seller (in terms of the number of potentialcustomers reached), whereas a comparable allowance to B would be worthless than $200. The seller would prefer, without any intent to discriminate,to reduce its allowance by B unitl the quantity of effective promotionalservices acquired per dollar spent on A and B is the same. Different allowancesto A and B may thus yield the seller the same amount of effective promotionalservices per dollar spent_rather than discrimination between A and B_beacusethe services the seller acquires or supplies per dollar spent on promotionsare the same.     In these circumstances, promotional allowances will not be supplied efficientlyif the seller is required to grant the same allowance to A and B, or ifthe seller is required to reimburse them in proportion to the expense eachincurs to provide a given promotional service.\7\<NOTE/> In the example above, if the seller must spend $200 on Bin order to spend $200 on A, the seller will secure a lower quantity ofeffective promotional services per dollar spent on B than per dollar spenton A, and promotional expenditures will be allocated inefficiently. Ineffect, the seller would have to discriminate in favor of B. Similarly,if the seller were required to reimburse A and B in proportion to the expenseeach incurred to provide a given promotional service and the seller spent$200 on A, it would have to spend more than $200 on B. Again, the sellerwould secure a lower quantity of effective promotional services per dollarspent on B than per doffar spent on A, and in effect would be discriminatingin favor of B.     <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ In <T3>Boise Cascade, </T3>107 F.T.C. 76 (1986), <T3>rev'd on other grounds,</T3> 837 F.2d 1127 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the Commissionpointed out that requiring discounts for allowances to be geared to customercost creates an undesirable incentive: Even if discounts accurately reflectedeach customers's cost, under any variable discount system the less efficientfirms with higher costs would received higher discounts_an economicallyunfortunate reversal of desired incentives. 107 F.T.C. at 212.   These effects can be restated in a slightly different way. An allowanceis the price paid by a seller for promotional services provided by customers.``Units'' of services offered by customers to the seller will differ inboth quality and cost, as a function of variations in customer size, location,costs, or access to different media. The seller will prefer to allocateallowances so that the price it pays per unit of comparable services remainsconstant. In this way, the seller will secure the same service for eachdollar spent. In the example above, requiring the seller to pay each customer $200 iscomparable to what is often called the <T3>seller's-</T3>cost standard. Requiring the seller to pay each customerthe customer's cost of providing the same service is comparable to whatis often called the <T3>customer's-</T3>cost standard. Both may produce an inefficient supplyand distribution of promotional allowances and services in various forms_andhence expose potential purchasers to the seller's product less efficiently_becausedifferent types or forms of such exposure may have different effects inincreasing the demand for the seller's product. Alternate andSection; 240.8 I propose below would give sellers greater flexibilitythan the existing Guides by expanding the definition of proportional equality.The seller, within limits, would be permitted to account for the fact thata particular promotional expenditure may produce different increases inthe seller's sales_or different numbers of consumers or potential consumersreached_as a function of which media, distributors, and retailers are used.Media would be defined broadly to include such things as displays, forwhich the number of consumers reached per dollar spent may differ significantly.Alternate andSection; 240.8 would treat as proportionally equal those promotionalexpenditures that result in approximately the same seller cost per consumeror potential consumer reached, or per unit of additional sales generated.Promotional expenditures or allowances offered in such a manner are notlikely to be discriminatory. Permitting sellers greater flexibility of course does not mean that allof them will use it. Alternative Section 240.8 would continue to permita seller to grant an allowance of a uniform amount per unit of productpurchased by a customer. In many instances a seller may secure a fairlyuniform service per unit of expense across media or customers, so thatit will have no incentive to vary the allowance. Giving sellers greater flexibility would be consistent with what one mightexpect in a competitive market. Competitive sellers have an incentive toseek out all profitable opportunities to provide promotional services orallowances, and to allocate them so that the price paid or expense incurredfor a given quantity of effective service is the same. In short, proportionalequality_as Alternate andSection; 240.8 would define it_will exist and persistin competitive markets. The definition of proportional equality that I propose in Alternate andSection;240.8 conforms with what is often called the ``value'' standard of proportionalequality. That standard is in turn consistent with the legislative historyof the Robinson Patman Act, and with the case law interpreting the conceptof proportional equality. The legislative history indicates that the term``proportional equality'' was intended to provide the measure by whicha seller could provide promotional services or allowances to both its largeand small customers on a basis which would not disproportionally favorlarge customers over small customers. Taken as a whole, the legislativehistory can be read as suggesting that Congress intended to permit ``proportionalequality'' to be based on either (1) a uniform allowance or service expenseper unit of sale or dollar volume purchased by the seller (the seller's-coststandard) or (2) a uniform allowance or service expense per unit of effectivepromotional service acquired (which I refer to here as the value standard).Although Alternate andSection;240.8 would define proportional equality interms of the value standard, it would accommodate the seller's cost standardas well. The few relevant cases in this area appear to establish the permissibilityof the value standard approach. In <T3>Lever Brothers Co.</T3>, the Commission held that <T3>either</T3> the cost <T3>or</T3> the value standard could be used to measure proportional equality.\8\<NOTE/> The Supreme Court apparently approved this approach in <T3>FTC v.

The court held, however, that this principle did not mean that aseller could make a grossly disproportionate offer to a single large customerand attempt to justify the disparity on the ground that the customer'sservice was uniquely valuable.

Thus, Alternate andSection; 240.8 would not conflictwith the <T3>Colonial Stores</T3> holding. A seller could not refuse to make servicesor allowances available to competitors, but it would have greater flexibilityin determining proportional equlity.On balance, the value approach appears to be consistent with the case law.The authorization for that approach seems to flow directly from the logicof the <T3>Lever Brothers</T3> decision. The Commission held that under section2(d), Lever Brothers could vary its allowances for different media basedessentially on differences in the number of consumers or potential consumersreached per dollar spent. And as a recent treatise on the Robinson-PatmanAct points out, there has been no judicial approval of the current Guides'apparent adoption of the cost standard as the sole means to proportionalize.\1\\3\<NOTE/> It therefore seems clear that sellers may rely on a value-basedapproach in complying with sections 2(d) and 2(e) of the Act.\1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ III E.

Bauer, <T3>Federal Antitrust Law</T3> 565-66 (1983).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Of course, in many cases sellers may find it too costlyto account for differences across customers or media in the quantity ofeffective promotional services acquired per dollar spent. The differencesmay be small, and to measure them is itself costly, so Alternative Section240.8 would permit sellers to continue to supply promotional services orallowances on a seller's-cost basis.For similar reasons, Alternate andSection; 240.8 would allow the introductionof evidence concerning the competitiveness of the relevant market to determinethe presence of absence of proportional equality. In competitive markets,customers are necessarily treated on proportionally equal terms. Thus,evidence concerning competitive conditions is, from an economic perspective,the most relevant basis for evaluating proportionality. Unfortunately,in the past, evidence of the competitiveness of the relevant market probablywould have been considered irrelevant. However, a more economically sensibleapproach appears to be consistent with the legislative history, is supportedby the economic literature, and does not appear to be precluded by thecase law.The legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act makes it clear thatthe Act was designed to prevent large and powerful companies from coercingfavorable arrangements from suppliers.\1\\5\<NOTE/> As Respresentative Patman maintained:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ <T3>See,</T3> <T3>e.g.</T3>, House Hearing on Bills to Amend the Clayton Act, 74th Cong.,1st Sess. 217 (1935).<ITAG tagnum="21">It is right up to you, whether you want these few large corporateconcerns, that have the money, that have the power, to continue to coerceand intimidate the manufacturers to get the prices that they want; as towhether or not you say it is a good thing for them to go ahead and getthese prices and destroy the independent merchant; or whether or not youshould write into this law some provision that would protect the weak onesagainst the strong ones.\1\\6\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ House Hearing on Bills to Amend the Clayton Act, 74thCong. 2d Sess., at 398 (1936); <T3>accord,</T3> <T3>e.g., </T3>Remarks of John E.

Patman, <T3>Complete Guide to the Robinson-Patman Act</T3> 3 (2d ed. 1963).Thus, it seems clear that the Act primarily was intended to prevent theuse of market power to grant or obtain discriminatory arrangements. Ina competitive market, where sellers or buyers do not possess substantialmarket power, no economically significant price discrimination is likelyto exist, much less persist, for any appreciable period of time.The federal courts have recognized that the perceived problem of largebuyers exercising coercive market power played a major role in the passageof the Act. For example, the Supreme Court has stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Robinson-Patman Act was passed in response to the problem perceivedin the increased market power and coercive practices of chain stores andother big buyers that threatened the existence of small independent retailers.\1\\9\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ <T3>Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. v.

For example, as Judge Posner has written:<ITAG tagnum="21">The second economic objection to price discrimination is that it isa symptom of_and more important, a condition fostering_monopoly or cartelpricing at the seller level.

In short, price discrimination among customers requires the possessionof substantial market power. This power may reside in sellers alone, whomay decide to discriminate among customers, or in buyers who may, undercertain circumstances, secure terms that are more favorable than thoseaccorded to other customers. The Robinson-Patman Act apparently was intendedto prevent the coercive use of market power, something that will not systematicallyoccur or persist in a competitive market. Therefore, evaluating the stateof competition in a market in order to determine whether promotional allowancesand services are being provided on a proportionally unequal basis seemsfully justified. Moreover, it would make analysis under sections 2(d) and(e) more consistent with the other antitrust laws. For the foregoing reasons, I propose that the commission modify proposedandSection;240.8 of the Guides to read as follows: Alternate andSection;240.8 Proportionally Equal Terms The Act requires that promotional services and allowances be made availableto competing customers on proportionally equal terms. In the view of thecommission, proportional equality is achieved if the amount of effectivepromotional services received per dollar of promotional expenditure bythe seller is the same across competing customers. Although the quantityof effective promotional services is ultimately determined by the salesgenerated by a promotion, it may be estimated in terms of the number ofpotential consumers expected to be reached by a promotion, the number ofpotential consumers expected to respond to a promotion, or other factorsreasonably believed to affect sales generated by a promotion. The sellermay estimate the quantity of effective promotional services acquired orprovided per dollar spent over a period of time sufficient to reveal patternsof effectiveness. This standard of proportional equality would be approached in any marketin which sellers use promotional services and allowances as a means ofpromoting the resale of their products through promotional activity, ratherthan as a form of disguised price discrimination. In such markets, eachseller would, over time, have the incentive to seek out all profitableopportunities to provide promotional services or allowances, and to expandtheir use so that the allowances paid or expenses incurred for the samequantity of effective promotional services are equal, with the result thatcustomers will be treated on proportionally equal terms. The result mightbe different in markets in which sellers have substantial market powerand use promotional services and allowances as a disguised form of pricediscrimination. Mathematical precision is not required for sellers to satisfy the standardof proportional equality, in part because the quantity of effective promotionalservices acquired from or supplied to each customer per dollar spent bya seller cannot be measured exactly. Nevertheless, sellers should havea reasonable basis for their provision of promotional services or allowances.One acceptable method of maintaining proportional equality is for the sellerto treat each customer's purchase volume as a proxy for an equally effectiveamount of promotional services, and to make uniform payments or provideuniform services per dollar or per unit of goods purchased during a specifiedperiod of time. In addition, if a seller has a reasonable basis for concludingthat it derives greater effective promotional services from expendituresin certain media or by allowances to certain customers or customer classesrelative to others, it may make larger payments for these media or to thesecustomers or customer classes if in doing so the amount of effective promotionalservices supplied or acquired per dollar spent remains substantially equalacross all customers or classes of customers. The seller should be preparedto show that it has not engaged in discrimination if it offers differentservices or allowances for promotions in different media or to differentcustomers. That is, the seller must be prepared to show that such differencesare justified by differences in the amount of effective promotional servicesbeing acquired or provided. The seller may base such a showing on predictivedata such as marketing studies, or on other reliable evidence. Evidence regarding whether the relevant market is competitive would helpin determining whether the proportional equality requirement is satisfied.In particular, evidence that a seller lacks substantial market power usuallydemonstrates that the seller has not engaged in economic discrimination,unless coerced by a buyer with substantial market power. Similarly, ifthe buying side of a market is competitive, this usually demonstrates thatthe customer involved does not possess the substantial market power neededto coerce proportionally unequal services or allowances.   If different types or groups of customers are offered different servicesor facilities (or different combinations or levels thereof), a differencein participation rates across customer types or groups does not in itselfimply that services or allowances are offered on proportionally unequalterms.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1:</T3> A seller may offer to pay a specified part (say 50%)of the cost of local advertising up to an amount equal to a specified percentage(say 5%) of the dollar value of purchases during a specified period oftime.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2:</T3> A seller may place in reserve for each customer a specifiedamount of money for each unit purchased, and use it to reimburse thesecustomers for the cost of advertising the seller's product.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3:</T3> Reliable evidence available to a seller indicates thata three-inch advertisement in Magazine A will reach 5,000 readers whilethe same-sized advertisement in Magazine B will reach 2,500 readers.

The seller can maintain proportional equalityin payments for promotional services by making a percentage contributionto Buyer A that is one and one half times that made to Buyer B and twicethat to Buyer C.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 7:</T3> Customer A offers a seller space for a display reaching1,000 potential consumers and Customer B offers space for a comparabledisplay reaching 500 potential consumers.

Thus, if Buyer A purchases an additional 100units, Buyer B an additional 50 units, and Buyer C an additional 25 units,the seller maintains proportional equality by allowing $100 to Buyer A,$50 to Buyer B, and $25 to Buyer C.</ITAG>I look forward to public comment on these two proposals, as well as onthe other proposals the Commission has published for comments.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-24731 Filed 10-25-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6750-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
