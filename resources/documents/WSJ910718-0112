In a special session with President Gorbachev after theirannual economic summit, the seven leaders presented asix-point plan to begin the process of incorporating theSoviet Union into the capitalist world. The centerpiece ofthe plan was a &quot;special association&quot; with the InternationalMonetary Fund. It also included technical assistance from theWest in several important areas and a promise of continuedconsultation with the leaders and finance ministers of theso-called Group of Seven nations.</LP><TEXT>   But at the insistence of the U.S. and Japan in particular,the leaders rejected any proposals to increase financialassistance, such as a plan favored by some European nationsto boost the Soviet borrowing limit from the new Bank forEuropean Reconstruction and Development.   Nevertheless, all the leaders praised the meeting as ahistoric step forward. &quot;This was a day I believe that historywill see as a landmark,&quot; said British Prime Minister JohnMajor, the host of the summit. &quot;It will be seen as the firststep in the Soviet Union becoming a full member of theinternational community.&quot;   President Bush praised what he called &quot;productivemeetings&quot; and said the seven nations would provide &quot;the kindof assistance that would encourage progress.&quot;   President Gorbachev, as well, called the event an&quot;unprecedented political dialogue&quot; and said he was verypleased with the outcome. &quot;We were not even talking about{financial} assistance,&quot; he said at a press conference. &quot;Wewere talking about a new idea of cooperation where we becomean organic part of the world economic space.&quot;   In a letter to the leaders last week, Mr. Gorbachev didsuggest several types of financial aid he would like toreceive, including money for a currency-stabilization fundthat would enable the ruble to become convertible into othercurrencies. A senior Bush administration official said thatidea was rejected for now because the Soviet Union still mustenact many economic reforms before it's ready for aconvertible currency. Mr. Gorbachev said there was &quot;a longdiscussion&quot; of the stabilization fund &quot;with the mutualunderstanding that this problem has to be resolved.&quot;   The special association with the IMF would give theSoviets access to technical expertise but not enable them toborrow from the multilateral agency. Mr. Major also said theleaders agreed to provide technical help to the Soviets insuch areas as energy, conversion of defense industries, fooddistribution, nuclear safety and transportation.   The summit leaders also called for &quot;intensified andcontinuing cooperation&quot; between the Soviet Union and othermultilateral institutions, and a re-establishment of thetrade that has collapsed between the Soviet Union and Easternand Central Europe. In order to continue talks with theSoviets, Mr. Major said that he would visit Moscow later thisyear, and that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who's nextyear's summit chairman, would visit Moscow next year. Mr.Major also said the seven leaders will encourage theirfinance ministers and their &quot;ministers for small business&quot; togo to the Soviet Union and maintain close contact with theircounterparts there.   In a news conference after the meeting, President Bushsaid he was impressed with Mr. Gorbachev's presentation.&quot;They want to reform,&quot; he said. &quot;They want to move tomarket.&quot; But administration officials said it's still unclearhow well Mr. Gorbachev understands the steps needed totransform his economy into a market economy, or how committedhe is to those steps. &quot;They have some of the answers, butthey don't have others,&quot; a top administration official said.   On global trade talks, all seven summit nations -- theU.S., Canada, Italy, Japan, France, Germany and Britain --strongly expressed their desire to complete the long-runningtalks by the end of this year. In the summit's economicdeclaration, the leaders agreed to &quot;remain personallyinvolved in this process, ready to intervene with one anotherif differences can only be resolved at the highest level.&quot;   Prime Minister Major said this commitment to getpersonally involved &quot;ensures a political push&quot; to completethe agreements. But there appears to have been no progressthis week on the specific issues that have stalled the talks.Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, while acknowledgingunanimity on the urgent need to complete a new agreement,said that &quot;how we get there met with somewhat lessunanimity.&quot;   Mr. Mulroney said disagreements over farm subsidies arestill the main roadblock in the talks. But the summitdeclaration also called for urgent movement in three otherareas: access to markets, trade in services and clear andenforceable rules on intellectual property such as copyrightsand software.   French President Francois Mitterrand saw hope in thislarger agenda. France has argued that agriculture shouldn'tbe treated differently than any of the other issues.&quot;Finally, it's been stated clearly that the GATT {GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade} negotiations aren't justabout agriculture. They now have four legs to stand on, andthat's progress,&quot; he said. Mr. Mitterrand added that he was abit more optimistic than he had been before the summit thatthe talks might be concluded by year end.   The leaders said they aim to complete the talks this yearbecause it will be difficult to get a trade treaty approvedin Congress as the 1992 elections approach.   The summit leaders also noted increasing signs of economicrecovery and called for policies that would result in &quot;lowerreal interest rates&quot; to sustain the recovery. In addition,the leaders agreed to allow more imports from Eastern Europe,particularly of steel, textiles and agricultural produce. Andthey agreed on the need for additional debt-relief measures,&quot;on a case-by-case basis,&quot; for the world's poorest countries.   The declaration also included a lengthy section on theenvironment, most of which was negotiated before the summit.One proposal that remained in dispute until the end was aproposal to provide money to help save the Brazilian tropicalforests. In the end, the summit nations agreed to providefinancing only for &quot;the preliminary stage of the pilotprogram&quot; for conserving the forests. It said the nations will&quot;consider supplementing these resources with bilateralassistance, so that progress can be made on the ground.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;U.S., U.S.S.R. to Sign The Treaty inMoscow At July 30-31 Summit&quot; -- WSJ July 18, 1991)   ---   Michel McQueen contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
