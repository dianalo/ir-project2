He kept on running, exclaiming,``We're going swimming.''   Accompanied by Republican Party chief Lee Atwater and a smallentourage, Bush jogged for 28 minutes around Hains Point in EastPotomac Park. A police boat followed along in the choppy riverwaters.   There was a light drizzle when Bush started and it turned into aheavy rain. By the time Bush stopped, the rain had tapered offagain.
