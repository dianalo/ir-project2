The hurricane, with 175 mph wind, ripped through Jamaica and theCayman Islands and took aim at the resort island of Cozumel,Mexico, and the Gulf of Mexico. At least 11 people have been killedand an estimated 60,000 left homeless.   Forecasters were reluctant to predict the destination of thestorm, called ``extremely dangerous'' by the National WeatherService, but some early guesses ranged from Freeport, about 30miles southwest of Galveston, to the Louisiana coast.   ``A hurricane is like a gorilla; normally it goes where itreally wants to go,'' said Harlingen TV forecaster Larry James.   Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center inCoral Gables, Fla., said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' thatTexas and Louisiana residents ``ought to be thinking about whatthey're going to do in case warnings are posted for their area.''   Asked about the threat to the United States, Sheets said,``We're looking at about 48 hours or so, maybe as much as 60 hours,but probably somewhere on the Texas or Louisiana coast. There's alittle uncertainty exactly where this hurricane's going to go.''   Robert Lansford, state coordinator of the governor's division ofemergency management in Austin, said on ``Good Morning America''that he thought the state had time to prepare. ``We've got ourfingers crossed,'' he added.   ``Local governments along the coast have been working feverishlyfor the last 24 hours trying to get ready for this thing, trying tofind out where it's going to go,'' Lansford said.   For the second time in two weeks, oil companies evacuatedthousands of workers from rigs in the Gulf. Last week, workers werebrought inland when Hurricane Florence washed ashore in Louisiana.   Bill Tompkins, coordinator for the Galveston County emergencypreparedness, said communications systems were being tested andprocedures were being reviewed. Based on forecasts from at leastfour sources, he expected the storm to be in the gulf by Thursdaymorning.   ``That's probably our most critical time,'' he said. ``We'll bemaking decisions Thursday morning about what to recommend to thecitizens.''   In Brownsville, Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez said he hasalready posted special schedules for his officers to follow if ahurricane watch is issued.   ``We've contacted all the schools for shelters, to see whichones we'll be using this time,'' said Perez. ``We're getting allthe emergency generators ready for the jails, and getting extra gasfor the patrol cars and getting everything set up.''   Gene Graves, marketing director for Petroleum Helicopters Inc.in Lafayette, La., said his company's 18 bases in the Gulf Coastregion were operating at full capacity evacuating the rigs. Heestimated that all the 10,000 or so workers who normally work thegulf would be evacuated by this afternoon.   ``I don't think anybody's going to ride this one out,'' he said.``We've got to have about a 24-hour cushion to play with this one.''   At the South Texas Nuclear Project near Bay City, employeessecured down loose objects at a reactor under construction.Employees reviewed procedures at the other reactor, which is inoperation, said spokesman Glen Walker.   The plant is 13 miles from the coast and its containment centeris built to withstand nature's forces _ including earthquakes and370 mph winds, he said.   ``The plant is probably the safest, most hurricane-proof plantalong the Gulf coast,'' he said.   At NASA's Johnson Space Center, spokesman Kyle Herring said thehurricane would not delay the flight of space shuttle Discovery,scheduled for launch later this month from Cape Canaveral, Fla.   The Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center and major hospitals askedfor blood donations.   In low-lying southern Louisiana today, schools closed early,coastal residents headed inland and workers prepared evacuationcenters.   Apprehensive residents in Galveston crowded stores in search ofprovisions such as batteries and plywood to board up windows.   ``I stayed here for (Hurricane) Alicia because I didn't realizehow bad it was going to be,'' said Verne Gordon. ``But I vowed I'dnever stay again.''   ``I really think Alicia is what has scared almost all of us.''   In 1983, Alicia killed 21 people, injured 1,800 and caused anestimated $3 billion in damages when it slammed ashore and blastedGalveston and Houston. But Alicia was a minimal Category 3 on theSaffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength with top winds at 130mph, compared to the Gilbert's Category 5 and 175 mph winds Tuesday.   The scale lists such a storm as potentially causing catastrophicdamage and having a storm surge of greater than 18 feet. Theweather service said Hurricane Gilbert was the most intense stormon record in terms of barometric pressure.   In September 1900, Galveston was the scene of the nation's worstnatural disaster, when an estimated 6,000 people were killed in ahurricane.   Off Louisiana's coast, the only school on Grand Isle _ GrandIsle High School _ was to close early today and remain closedThursday and Friday. The town of about 2,000 lies unprotected,connected to the mainland by a two-lane highway.   ``We wanted to get the kids out of school before they call anevacuation,'' said school official Irwin Rhodes Jr., explainingthat buses bringing children home would impede evacuation.</TEXT></DOC>
