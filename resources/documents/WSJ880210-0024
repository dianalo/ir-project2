Nearly all the smaller exchanges posted declines.    Tokyo share prices were weaker in thin dealings at the end of the afternoon session, as most investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of Friday's U.S. trade figures and holidays in Japan and the U.S.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which declined 19.59 points Monday, fell 109.33 to close at 23662.27.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, share prices were firmer. The Nikkei index rose 88.21 points to 23750.48 at the end of the morning session.    Dealers said that although weakness in blue-chip issues depressed the Nikkei index Tuesday, most first section issues posted only narrow declines. The first section index fell 2.07 to 1924.87. First section volume was estimated at an exceptionally light 380 million shares, down from 430 million shares Monday.    One trader said a major securities firm bought large blocks of shares in several major banks toward the close of trading, helping them rebound from intraday lows, and into the plus column in some cases.    &quot;That's the only reason the index wasn't down 200 points,&quot; he said.    Sumitomo Bank gained 50 yen to 3,670 ($28.50), while Industrial Bank of Japan rose 50 to 3,550.    Taisei rose 19 to 906, and Kajima rose 20 to 1,480. Dealers said the construction issues rose on an announcement that they won contracts from the city of Tokyo to build a new city hall.    Traders said some selective buying of speculative shares also helped boost the overall market. However, some said the concentration on smaller speculative shares was indicative of nervousness about how the market might behave ahead of the U.S. trade figures for December.    They said the approach of holidays Thursday in Japan and Monday in New York is also helping to keep investors on the sidelines.    In London, share prices ended slightly higher after bouncing from Monday's sharp fall.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed 6.9 higher at 1355.9. The 100-share index ended up 12.7 at 1707.2, and volume was a low 325.3 million, compared with 395.7 million Monday.    One dealer said prices were marked up Tuesday because of a feeling that they had been oversold during Monday's fall. Traders also attributed Tuesday's rise to the fact that the Bank of England didn't force a new round of base lending rate rises. A slight rise in money market rates Monday led to speculation that the central bank was planning another increase.    The London market also was bolstered by a firm opening on Wall Street.    Among major gainers was Imperial Chemical Industries, which rose 17 pence to #10.05 ($17.50); Glaxo Holdings, which was up 8 pence at 983 pence; Shell Transport andamp; Trading, up 15 pence at #10.48; Hawker Siddely, up 15 at 458; and Rank, which rose 11 to 618.    Scottish andamp; Newcastle was one of the strongest gainers, rising to 241 pence from its Monday close of 223 pence. The company announced Australia's Elders has taken a 2% stake.    Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange ended narrowly higher in what brokers called lethargic and directionless trading.    Investors and professional traders stayed on the sidelines as neither the foreign exchange market nor the corporate front offered any fresh factors to trade on, brokers said. The bond market also failed to offer any trading cues, they said.    The rebound of the U.S. currency to a level above 1.7 marks after a short sell-off Monday was seen as reason to buy, but most market participants are waiting for the release of U.S. trade figures before making any decisions.    Price changes were random, with automobile and electrical shares mostly on the upside and financial issues generally lower.    The only blue-chip share recording a substantial change was auto stock Daimler-Benz, which jumped 14.5 marks to 592 ($348) on news reports that the group may acquire 20% of state-owned aerospace concern Messerschmitt Boelkow Blohm in March as a first step toward majority control. According to the weekly Der Spiegel, Daimler wants to purchase the profitable parts of the high-technology group while leaving its stake in troubled aircraft producer Airbus Industrie to the state.    Meanwhile, stocks closed lower in Paris, Zurich, Brussels, Stockholm and Milan, and were mixed in Amsterdam.    Trading in Paris was active, as the market's soft tone mainly reflected profit-taking on last week's gains. Brokers also suggested that investors became a bit more cautious about buying. Electronics and engineering issues, which had been inflated by takeover speculation, had some of the most significant drops.    Most Asian markets also posted losses. Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Taipei, Manila, Wellington and Singapore and were mixed in Hong Kong.    Losses were especially steep in Sydney, where stocks took a further battering. A sharp decline on the London market Monday combined with ebbing domestic sentiment to knock the prices of major shares sharply lower. Selling pressure was sustained throughout the day and intensified during the afternoon as jittery overseas and domestic institutions reduced their exposure to benchmark stocks.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                       % This                                     Feb 8    Feb 5    Year    U.S. ........................... 230.9    232.5  +  0.7    Britain ........................ 512.8    526.3  -  0.6    Canada ......................... 329.5    332.2  -  6.0    Japan ......................... 1134.3   1130.4  + 10.9    France ......................... 281.8    283.0  -  2.3    Germany ........................ 153.2    152.0  -  2.2    Hong Kong ..................... 1572.1   1615.6  -  4.4    Switzerland .................... 146.5    146.5  +  4.1    Australia ...................... 235.3    238.8  -  9.2    World index .................... 409.5    410.9  +  0.4</TEXT></DOC>
