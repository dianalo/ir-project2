The provision, part of an anti-drug bill working its way through the House, would give law enforcement officials time to check whether someone buying a handgun has a history of criminal activity or mental problems. A 1968 law bars such people from owning guns, but it has no effective enforcement mechanism.    Supporters of the measure, including several police groups, argue that such a nationwide law is needed because drug dealers and other criminals can buy guns in states with weak gun laws and use them in states with tougher statutes. The House provision was sponsored by Rep. Edward Feighan (D., Ohio). A comparable measure is pending in the Senate.    The vote was the latest in a series of legislative setbacks for the National Rifle Association. The group, under growing political pressure, recently has had to back away from opposition to bans on armor-piercing bullets, plastic guns that can't be detected by security X-rays and the private purchase of machine guns. </TEXT></DOC>
