Channell was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Harrison his guilty plea to conspiracy to defraud the Treasury.   Channell had admitted raising $2 million to help arm the Contrasfrom private donors who were told they could deduct from theirincome taxes money given to the tax-exempt National Endowment forthe Preservation of Liberty. Weapons purchases are not a deductiblepurpose of a tax-exempt foundation.   Harris said it was ``very difficult'' to impose a sentence ``whencrimes have been committed by someone so firmly dedicated tofurthering the interests of the country.''   The judge said that because of Channell's early cooperation withIran-Contra prosecutors he was placing him on probation.   Michael Bromwich, an associate independent counsel, told Harristhat Channell ``has fully lived up to the terms of his cooperationagreement.''   ``Malice never entered my decisions, my heart or my mind becauseI love this country,'' Channell told Harris.   ``I suffer more because I have committed a crime against thecountry which I love so much,'' said Channell.   Channell's sentencing came a day after his former associate,Richard R. Miller, was placed on two years' probation and ordered toperform 120 hours of community service for his inolvement in thefundraising effort.   Harris did not explain why he did not order Channell to performany community service.   Channell and Miller both cooperated with independent counselLawrence E. Walsh's investigation of the Iran-Contra affair andtestified as prosecution witnesses at the trial of former WhiteHouse aide Oliver L. North.   They both entered guilty pleas early in the investigation tocharges of conspiring to defraud the Treasury by using a tax-exemptfoundation to raise money for the non-deductible purpose of buyingweapons for the Contras.   Miller admitted helping raise $3.2 million to help the rebels.Both Miller and Channell could have been sentenced up to five yearsin prison and fined up to $250,000.   Channell and Miller said North was part of their conspiracy touse the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty to raisemoney for the Contras from such private donors as Texas billionaireNelson Bunker Hunt.   At the time, U.S. military aid to the rebels was banned byCongress.   North was acquitted of the tax conspiracy charge by a jury thatconvicted him of trying to cover up the Iran-Contra affair and ofillegally accepting a home security system from arms dealer RichardV. Secord.   On Wednesday, North was fined $150,000, placed on two years'probation and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service.   During Thursday's proceeding, Harris said Miller had suffered anumber of adversities as a result of his guilty plea. ``I need notimpose more for justice to be served,'' the judge said.   Miller told Harris: ``I let my guard down. It may have been blindpatriotism, but that's no excuse.'' He said helping the Contras``was a cause that meant everything to me and in that fervor Iturned a blind eye to the excesses of others and I crossed the linemyself.''   Outside the courthouse, associate independent counsel DavidZornow said Miller ``came forward at a very early stage of theinvestigation to admit his wrongdoing, pleaded guilty to a veryserious charge and agreed to cooperate with the government.''   ``He lived up to his agreement with the government,'' Zornowsaid. ``This closes the chapter on Mr. Miller.''</TEXT></DOC>
