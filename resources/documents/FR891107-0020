Background</ITAG>The SAFAH program was authorized in 1987 by subtitle D, title IV of theStewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11391-11394) (McKinneyAct) to provide (1) comprehensive assistance for particularly innovativeprograms for, or alternative methods of, meeting the immediate and long-termneeds of the homeless and (2) assistance to cover the costs in excess ofassistance provided under the Emergency Shelter Grants and Supportive HousingDemonstration programs. HUD issued program guidelines for SAFAH, togetherwith a Notice of Funds Availability, on October 19, 1987 (52 FR 38880).The program guidelines were amended by a Notice, for immediate effect,on January 11, 1989 (54 FR 1006), which implemented amendments to the programmade by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988(Pub. L. 100-628, approved November 7, 1988) (1988 Amendment Act). The1988 Amendments Act required that HUD publish a final rule for the programwithin 12 months from the date of enactment of the Act. HUD invited publiccomments on the program amendments announced in the January, 1989 Notice,as well as on the guidelines issued in October, 1987, for considerationin the final rule.This final rule responds to the public comments received by HUD after publicationof the January Notice and to comments from homeless service providers madeto HUD staff at meetings around the country. The rule also reflects theSecretary's priority to end the tragedy of homelessness by simplifyingthe application and selection processes. Some changes are made in the finalrule in an effort to make the SAFAH program as consistent as possible withother HUD programs that serve the homeless, such as the Emergency ShelterGrants and Supportive Housing Demonstration programs. These programs haveall been combined under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for CommunityPlanning and Development, and will be similar in policy, organization,and administration.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Public Comments</ITAG>HUD received written comments from a local government agency and a privatenonprofit organization. Their comments focused on the following areas:Environmental Review Procedures (andSection; 579.220)The local government agency commented on the change, announced in the JanuaryNotice, that requires States, metropolitan cities, urban counties, andother units of general local government to assume responsibility for theenvironmental review. The commenter believes that HUD's environmental reviewprocedures in 24 CFR part 58, for which HUD requires the applicants describedabove to assume responsibility, are too time-consuming and strict, causingdelays in beginning construction. The commenter thought that there shouldbe a provision for a waiver of compliance with HUD procedures for applicantsthat are subject to other state and local environmental review requirements.Section 482 of the 1988 Amendments Act provides that the regulations andprocedures applicable under section 104(g) of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1974 are to be applied to all programs under title IVof the McKinney Act. Section 104(g) authorizes HUD to assign the Federalenvironmental review responsibilities to grantees deemed to have the legalcapacity for environmental review (States, metropolitan cities, urban counties,and other units of general local government) and to define how the responsibilitiesare to be performed. The regulations at 24 CFR part 58 describe the requirementsfor grantees that assume the responsibilities.The 1988 Amendments Act recognizes that the objectives of the programsare best served by a consolidation of environmental review responsibilitiesat the applicant level. Many applicants seek funding under more than oneMcKinney Act program, and a single environmental review should often sufficefor those applicants. According to the Report of the House Committee onBanking, Finance and Urban Affairs, the intent of section 482 of the 1988Amendments Act was to expedite the consideration of applications. However,the Report states that the Committee expects all applicants to adhere toall requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and that``this amendment does not lessen any requirement for any project to complywith the NEPA standards.'' (See H.R. Rep. No. 100-718, part II, 100th Cong.,2d Sess. 39 (1988).)The requirements of statutes, Executive Orders, and the regulations ofoversight agencies that are imposed on applicants through part 58 cannotbe waived. Requirements arising out of a statute or Executive Order donot allow for waivers. Those that are regulatory, <T3>i.e.</T3>, the Council on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations (40CFR parts 1500-1508) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservationregulations (36 CFR part 800), make some provision for ``emergencies,''but these are for conditions more extreme than a concern for processingdelays. Compliance with the review processes and time periods under theauthorities listed in 24 CFR 58.5 is mandatory_whether responsibility forreview is assigned to the applicant under section 104(g) or retained andexercised by HUD under 24 CFR part 50. In addition, HUD has no legislativeauthority to allow the applicability of State or local environmental requirementsto substitute for the Federal requirements.In andSection; 579.220(b)(3), the final rule clarifies that applicants assumingresponsibility for environmental reviews may arrange for local governments,with the appropriate technical capability, to conduct the technical review,as long as the applicants still retain all legal responsibilities, <T3>i.e.</T3>, independently evaluate information submitted and assumeresponsibility for its accuracy, scope, and content, and carry out anymitigation measures called for by the review. Applicants may also adoptprior reviews conducted by HUD or another governmental entity if the reviewsadequately address the assisted projects and meet the particular requirementsof the Federal environmental law or authority under which they would beadopted, and only under certain conditions (<T3>e.g.</T3>, a determination that no environmentally significant changeshave occurred since the review was done).The nonprofit organization commented that SAFAH procedures with respectto projects or activities on historical sites should be revised to conformwith the Supportive Housing requirements. The SAFAH guidelines requiredthat applications include a determination from the State Historic PreservationOfficer (SHPO). In contrast, the Supportive Housing program permitted anapplicant to submit a copy of its request to the SHPO and to forward theSHPO's determination upon availability. (The Supportive Housing rule didnot address the issue of historic preservation specifically; rather, thisparticular requirement was in the application package.)HUD agrees that the two programs should be consistent, and has deletedfrom the final rule the requirement that applicants submit the SHPO's determinationwith their applications. This deletion does not change the requirementthat a determination from the SHPO is necessary, but recognizes that theidentification of historic properties and the issue of the effect of theproposed project on the properties is a part of the environmental reviewprocess. In cases where HUD conducts the review (andSection; 579.220(b)(1)),it is HUD's responsibility to identify historic properties and addresseffects on them; and where the applicant conducts the review (andSection;579.220(b)(2)), it is the applicant's responsibility. (The same rule willapply to the Supportive Housing Demonstration program.)Zoning RequirementsThe nonprofit organization commented that, under the SAFAH guidelines,an applicant has to project in its application that proposed zoning actionswould be completed within 30 days following selection for funding, whileunder the Supportive Housing regulations, the period of time is four months.The commenter believed that the two programs should be consistent. HUDagrees and has changed the SAFAH rule to match the Supportive Housing rule.A SAFAH applicant will be required to submit with the application a writtenstatement from the unit of general local government in which the projectis proposed to be located (or other evidence satisfactory to HUD) thatthe use of the site is permissible under applicable zoning ordinances andregulations; or a statement from the applicant describing the proposedactions necessary to make the use of the site permissible under applicablezoning ordinances and regulations, with evidence that there is a reasonablebasis to believe that the proposed zoning actions will be completed successfullyand within four months following submission of the application (andSection;579.210(b)(12)).Matching FundsThe nonprofit organization commented that SAFAH matching fund requirementsshould be reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent and that applicants shouldbe allowed to include other Federal funds, such as Federal Emergency ManagementAgency (FEMA) funds, ESG funds, and Community Services Block Grants (CSBG),in addition to Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). HUD believesthe commenter may be confusing the SAFAH program with other HUD homelessassistance programs, because, there were no matching fund requirementsunder the SAFAH program guidelines. The guidelines did provide, as doesthe final rule, that HUD will give points toward selection if applicantscan show an ability to leverage other resources (andSection; 579.215(b)(3)).HUD believes that the extent to which an applicant can show funding fromother sources demonstrates the applicant's capacity to carry out the proposedactivities in a successful manner, community support for the applicant'sproposed activities, and a commitment by the applicant to providing forthe needs of the homeless.HUD will allow the use of CSBG and CDBG funds as a source of non-Federalfunds for the purpose of leveraging, since, after they are awarded, CSBGand CDBG funds become subject, broadly speaking, to local (or State) prioritiesand discretion. To allow other McKinney Act funds, however, such as FEMAor ESG funds, would frustrate the intent of the program to stimulate newresources for the local efforts.The same commenter proposed that the fair market value of a facility shouldbe considered as an eligible ``match.'' The SAFAH guidelines allowed thefair market value of a donated facility as a leveraging resource. The finalrule retains that provision in andSection; 579.110(b)(2)(ii).The commenter also suggested that volunteer time should be valued at prevailingwages rather than the currently allowed $5 per hour. HUD disagrees. First,HUD would have no practical way of verifying such rates, the use of whichcould result in unsubstantiated differences in the valuation of volunteerservices from applicant to applicant. Second, HUD believes that the legislativehistory of the 1988 Amendments Act indicates congressional approval ofthe $5-per-hour value. Section 452 of the 1988 Amendments Act authorizedthe value of volunteer time and services as matching funds for SupportiveHousing funds, at a rate to be determined by the Secretary. The legislativehistory of this provision shows that the House Committee on Banking, Financeand Urban Affairs authorized volunteer time and services to be countedas a source of matching funds, because such sources were authorized inthe ESG program and the two programs should be uniform in approach. Accordingto the House Report, the Committee believed that the value of volunteertime and services should be calculated ``in the same manner as in the EmergencyShelter Grants Program.'' (H.R. Rep. No. 100-718, Part II, 100th Cong.,2d Sess. 38 (1988).) HUD interprets this to mean that Congress intendedthat the value of volunteer time and services in the Supportive Housingprogram should be calculated at $5 an hour, which is the value used forcalculating such services in the ESG program (24 CFR 576.71(b)). HUD believesthis also indicates that Congress intends for all McKinney Act programsto be consistent and, therefore, approves the $5-an-hour value for theSAFAH program.Use of FundsThe nonprofit organization suggested that case management should be includedamong the supportive services eligible for funding. Case management isnot excluded from the definition of supportive services in andSection; 579.5,and HUD believes the definition is broad enough to encompass such services.(Case management is specifically included in the definition of outpatientservices.)The commenter also proposed that, under comprehensive assistance (andSection;579.100), acquisition advances should be available to repay an outstandingdebt on a loan made to purchase a facility, as authorized for the SupportiveHousing program by section 445 of the 1988 Amendments Act. HUD disagrees,since this type of assistance was authorized by a specific statutory authorizationfor the Supportive Housing Program. Absent specific statutory authorizationfor SAFAH comprehensive assistance, repayment of outstanding debts on loanstaken out to purchase a facility should not be available under that category.However, advances for repayment of outstanding debts on such loans wouldbe eligible under the category of assistance in excess of ESG or SHD funding(andSection; 579.105), since any assistance available under those programswould be available under SAFAH's excess assistance category.The commenter also suggested that, under the excess assistance category,funding for existing facilities or services should be available for currentlevels of operation as well as expansion. In andSection;andSection; 577.125(a)(2)(iv)and 578.125(a)(2)(iv), the final rule for Supportive Housing allows fundingfor improvements to existing facilities, without expansion of the program,when such improvements are necessary to bring the structures to a levelthat meets applicable State and local government health and safety standards.This change in the Supportive Housing rule will carry over to the SAFAHprogram to the extent that an applicant is applying for excess assistancefor that purpose, since excess assistance follows the eligibility requirementsof either SHD or ESG assistance. However, because of the nature of theassistance, <T3>i.e., </T3>rehabilitating structures, the only assistance availablefor existing structures with no expansion of services will be rehabilitationassistance. Comprehensive assistance remains available for existing facilitiesonly when the applicant proposes an expansion of the program.Funding LevelsThe nonprofit organization suggested that caps for moderate rehabilitationgrants should be raised to $200,000 (or $400,000 in high cost areas), asnow allowed in the SHD program under the 1988 Amendments Act. The definitionof moderate rehabilitation under the SAFAH guidelines was based on theamount of HUD's expenditure, which was capped at $100,000. This final rulecontains new definitions of both moderate rehabilitation and substantialrehabilitation, which are based on the extent of rehabilitation to thestructure, as indicated by the comparison between the cost of rehabilitationand the fair market value of the structure before rehabilitation. Rehabilitationof a project involving costs of 75 percent or less of the value of thestructure before rehabilitation will be considered moderate rehabilitation,and costs in excess of 75 percent of the value of the structure beforerehabilitation will be considered substantial. HUD believes that basingthe definition on the value of the rehabilitation to the structure ratherthan on the cost of the rehabilitation is a more reasonable interpretationof the terms.The new definitions used in the SAFAH final rule are the same as thoseused in the amended final rule for the SHD program (24 CFR parts 577 and578). However, the SHD rule has a $200,000 (or $400,000 in high cost areas)statutory limitation on the amount of the HUD expenditure. The McKinneyAct did not limit the amount of assistance for the SAFAH program. The SHDlimitation has not been extended to the SAFAH program, because HUD believesthe congressional intent of the SAFAH program is to compensate for programmaticrigidities in the ESG and SHD programs, such as limitations on the amountsof HUD advances or grants. (See H.R. Rep. No. 100-174, 100th Cong., 1stSess. 81 (1987).)<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Other Changes</ITAG>Other changes to the final rule have been made in response to commentsfrom homeless service providers at meetings with HUD staff and in an effortto make the application and selection processes of the SAFAH program moreconsistent with those processes under the ESG and SHD programs.Definitions (andSection; 579.5)The definition of applicant now includes governmental entities, which wereadded as eligible SAFAH applicants by a technical amendment to section431 of the McKinney Act by section 570(i) of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-242, approved Feb. 5, 1988). HUD willrecognize governmental entities with general governmental powers as wellas those with limited or special powers as eligible applicants for SAFAHfunding.The definition of handicapped that was included in the guidelines has beenremoved. The guidelines definition was the same as the definition usedin the SHD rule. The Department has determined that this definition ofhandicapped, while required for the SHD program by section 422(2) of theMcKinney Act, is not required for the SAFAH program.The definition of operating costs has been included in the final rule.Operating costs are available in both the comprehensive assistance categoryand the excess assistance category.Comprehensive Assistance (andSection; 579.100)Operating costs have been added to the final rule as an eligible type ofassistance under the comprehensive assistance category. Section 461 ofthe 1988 Amendments Act amended section 432(a)(2)(A) to authorize comprehensiveassistance for the operation of facilities to assist the homeless.Excess Assistance (andSection; 579.105)HUD has revisited the issue of eligible applicants for assistance in excessof ESG and SHD funding, and has concluded that this category of assistanceshould be available only for projects that have been approved for fundingunder either the ESG or SHD program. The language of section 432(a)(1)of the McKinney Act, which authorizes the excess assistance category, statesthat it is authorized ``to cover the costs in excess of assistance providedunder the emergency shelter grant program or the supportive housing demonstrationprogram.'' HUD interprets this statutory language to mean that applicantsthat have been approved for ESG or SHD funding may receive supplementalassistance under the SAFAH program.Location of Projects in Floodplains (andSection; 579.220(e))In the January 11, 1989 Notice of changes to the SAFAH guidelines, HUDannounced that section 451 of the 1988 Amendments Act, which requires thatflood protection standards for housing acquired, rehabilitated, or assistedwith SHD funds may be no more restrictive than those applicable under ExecutiveOrder 11988, Floodplain Management (May 24, 1977), would also be appliedto the SAFAH program. HUD interpreted section 451 to mean that, for projectslocated in floodplains, the eight-step process of public notification anddecisionmaking outlined in the U.S. Water Resources Council FloodplainManagement Guidelines (43 FR 6030, February 10, 1978) must be undertakenbefore any decision is made on the environmental acceptability of the projectsite for homeless assistance.The eight-step process, which is performed during the environmental review,applies to all applications for projects in a 100-year floodplain and,for critical actions (<T3>i.e. </T3>any activity for which even a slight chance of flooding wouldbe too great), in a 500-year floodplain. HUD defined critical actions asthose projects intended to serve developmentally disabled, chronicallymentally ill, or mobility impaired residents. HUD has reconsidered thisissue after a comment on the same requirement in the permanent housingfor the handicapped homeless component of the SHD program, and is revisingthe SAFAH and SHD final rules with respect to projects in a 500-year floodplain.HUD has concluded that the treatment of all projects for handicapped personsunder this program as critical actions is overinclusive. Persons with onetype of handicap may experience no difficulty in evacuating a structureor following instructions on safety in the event of flooding, while personswith another type might have varying degrees of difficulty. However, becausethere is an insufficient basis at this time for differentiating among handicappedgroups to be served by facilities assisting the homeless, the rule willnot treat SAFAH projects serving the developmentally disabled, chronicallymentally ill, or mobility impaired homeless as critical actions. All SAFAHprojects will be subject to the eight-step process only when located ina 100-year floodplain, which is the restriction that applies to all non-criticalactions in accordance with Executive Order 11988.Limitations on Use of Assistance (andSection; 579.110)Paragraph (c) of andSection; 579.110, which describes the limitations onthe use of assistance by primarily religious organizations, contain provisionsgoverning the circumstances under which HUD will provide assistance toa recipient that is a primarily religious organization or a wholly secularorganization established by a primarily religious organization. With oneexception noted below, these provisions are substantially identical tothose set out in 24 CFR part 570, which consists of HUD's community developmentblock grant program (CDBG) entitlement rules.Under these provisions, a primarily religious organization (or wholly secularorganization established by a primarily religious organization) must agreeto provide housing and supportive services in a manner that is free fromreligious influence. In this connection, the provider must (1) not discriminateagainst any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of religionand not limit employment or give employment preference to persons on thebasis of religion; (2) not discriminate against, or limit the provisionof housing or supportive services, to applicants for such housing or serviceson the basis of religion; and (3) provide no religious instruction or counseling,conduct no religious worship or services, engage in no religious proselytizing,or otherwise exert no religious influence in the provision of housing orsupportive services.As noted, the foregoing principles depart in one fashion from the CDBGentitlement rule at 24 CFR 570.200(j)(3) (53 FR 34416, 34412, Sept. 6,1988), which contains an additional restriction that the portion of thefacility of the primarily religious organization used to provide fundedservices ``shall contain no religious symbols or decorations, other thanthose permanently affixed to or part of the structure.''This policy has been followed for several years in connection with CDBGand homeless assistance made available through primarily religious organizationproviders. The Department has a continuing commitment to optimize participationby religious providers, which have long been in the forefront in assistingthe homeless and other most needy, but in a manner consistent with thestrictures imposed by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment ofthe United States Constitution. After a review of the relevant case law,the Department has not found any dispositive case addressing the provisionof government assistance to a primarily religious organization providingsocial services in a setting where the presence of religious symbols ordecorations alone constitutes a violation of the Establishment Clause.The provision in question, which was recommended to HUD by counsel representinga nationally prominent primarily religious organization as a protectionagainst impermissibly advancing religion, has been utilized in the spiritin which it was so recommended. However, as noted, HUD's examination ofthe case law has concluded that the excised language suggests a degreeof control on the presence of religious symbols or decorations that isnot compelled thereunder, or is not otherwise intrinsic to traditionalConstitutional Church/State separation doctrine as pronounced by the UnitedStates Supreme Court. Accordingly, this rule does not include the prohibitionon religious symbols or decorations. Further, an amendment removing thequoted text from andSection; 570.200(j)(3)(iv) is being published as a finalrule in a separate document.This change in no way contravenes the purpose of the underlying principlesin these rules, namely, that a primarily religious organization, or a whollysecular organization established by a primarily religious organization,can only provide housing and supportive services in a manner that is freefrom religious influence, specifically including the explicit provisionsdescribed above.The limitation on the use of assistance for administrative costs has beenexpanded to include all grants and advances (paragraph (e)). The provisionalso clarifies that administrative costs are those costs associated withadministering the assistance provided by HUD.Application and Selection Process (Subpart D)The program guidelines had separate processes, with slightly differingrequirements, for the two categories of assistance available under theSAFAH program. The final rule provides for only one application processfor both categories, with no threshold requirements. (Many of the formerthreshold requirements in the guidelines were retained, but were movedto the sections covering application requirements, ranking criteria, orprogram requirements.) The ranking criteria are also the same for bothcategories.Program Requirements (Subpart E)The provision in the guidelines to the effect that restrictions on theuse of structures be contained in covenants recorded in land records whenassistance was provided for structures has been eliminated from the finalrule. Comments received from providers of housing for the homeless in meetingsand workshops have convinced HUD that this provision is difficult to enforce,given the varying laws of jurisdictions. The removal of this provision,however, is not an indication of a lowered commitment on HUD's part toenforce the grant agreements in other appropriate ways.Under the guidelines, HUD would not fund any applications that would resultin the temporary or permanent displacement of any person or entity. A newsection has been added with regard to relocation assistance to personswho are displaced as a result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolitionof a structure to be assisted under the SAFAH program (andSection; 579.315).HUD is currently amending all its regulations to comply with the UniformRelocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970and new governmentwide implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. Therule now requires recipients to provide relocation assistance to displacedpersons.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other Matters</ITAG>The collection of information requirements for the SAFAH program have beensubmitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980.

An analysis of the rule indicates thatit would not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. TheFinding is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m.weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the GeneralCounsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room 10276, 451 SeventhStreet SW., Washington, DC 20410.The General Counsel, as the designated official under Executive Order 12606,The Family, has determined that some of the policies in this final rulewill have a potential significant impact on the formation, maintenance,and general well-being of participating homeless families. Participationof families in the program can be expected to support family values, byhelping families remain together; by enabling them to live in decent, safe,and sanitary housing; and by offering the supportive services that arenecessary to acquire the skills and means to live independently in mainstreamAmerican society. The General Counsel has also determined, as the Designated Official forHUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that the provisionrequiring States and other governmental entities to assume the responsibilitiesfor environmental review, decisionmaking, and action under NEPA and otherenvironmental authorities has Federalism implications. While the assignmentof these responsibilities under section 1904(g) of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1974 is discretionary with HUD, it is authorized byand clearly the intent of section 443 of the 1988 Amendments Act. Therefore,the policy is not subject to review under Executive Order 12612.
