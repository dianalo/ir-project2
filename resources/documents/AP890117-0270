Among the 434 deals done last year were a record 14 valued atmore than $100 million, according to Broadview Associates, aninvestment banker that does a quarterly survey for Adapso, thecomputer software and services industry association.   Overall, the transactions were valued at a record $8.4 billion,up from $4.9 billion in 1987, Broadview said. The number of dealsrose 21 percent from 358 in 1987.   The biggest deal was the $1.6 billion purchase of IMSInternational Inc. by Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp, Broadview said.   Many of the buyers were big companies that preferred to buyestablished companies rather than try to build software and servicesbusinesses from scratch.   For private companies, being acquired can enrich the originalowners while giving their company the resources to continue itsgrowth. The alternative of making a public stock offering isunattractive in the current market, Broadview said.</TEXT></DOC>
