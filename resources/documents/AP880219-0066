After the cease-fire began at 8 a.m., two parallel rows of Thaiand Laotian flags were put up to mark off a two-mile zone whichsoldiers are forbidden to cross, said the army chief of staff, Gen.Charuay Wongsayant.   Thai and Laotian military officials agreed to the cease-fire onWednesday, after two days of talks in Bangkok. They decided toseparate their soldiers within 48 hours of the start of the truce.   Hundreds of soldiers have died since fighting flared lastNovember for sparsely populated hills between Thailand's northernprovince of Phitsanulok and Laos' Sayaboury province. Each sideclaims that the area about 240 miles north of Bangkok is in itsterritory.   Col. Rithee Rungkaputi, chief of the Third Army Region'scivilian affairs department, said there was a half-hour longskirmish in one of the contested hills an hour before the trucebegan. He said there were no casualties.   He said the clash probably was due to a delay in communicatingthe cease-fire order to field troops.   He also reported a heavy artillery exchange and two groundclashes on Wednesday and Thursday, when Thai and Laotian militaryteams were meeting in Bangkok to work out the truce.   Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila told reporters today thatforeign ministry officials have been dispatched to Paris to seekthe French government's assistance in resolving the conflictingclaims. The Thais say a 1907 French-Thai treaty shows the disputedarea is inside Thailand.   Meanhile, the official Laotian news agency KPL today quoted Maj.Gen. Thonglay Kommasith, deputy head of the general politicaldepartment of the Laotian army, as saying the talks in Bangkok had``paved the way towards negotiations, a diplomatic channel to solvethe Lao-Thai border problem.''   Thonglay, who participated in the talks, spoke at a newsconference in Vientiane Thursday, said the dispatch monitored inBangkok.   The agreement calls for the two governments to hold talks within15 days of the start of the truce to decide the location of theborder.   Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyuth, the Thai army commander, said hewould be going to Laos' capital of Vientiane within two days at theinvitation of Gen. Sisavat Keobounphan, the chief of the Laotianarmy general staff and Chaovalit's counterpart at Wednesday's talks.</TEXT></DOC>
