The Dow Jones Industrial Average added to its 17.24-point gain in the previous session by rising 4.45 to 2025.96 despite weakness in key blue-chip issues. Among other market averages, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index added 0.21 to 260.77 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.15 to 147.64.    Big Board volume rose to 169.5 million shares, from 162.8 million Tuesday, as the result of increased trading by institutions seeking to capture the dividends of high-yielding stocks. Declining issues outnumbered gaining issues, 742 to 660.    After posting modest gains throughout the morning, stocks turned lower just before midday. Traders said the early rise failed to generate enough buying interest to allow the market to preserve those gains.    The market then drifted at lower levels for much of the afternoon until certain blue chips began to attract some buyers, which pushed the averages to slightly higher levels in the final half-hour of trading.    Peter J. DaPuzzo, director of retail equity block trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said the market's lack of direction reflected the lack of interest affecting most participants. &quot;You're seeing an apathetic market -- one with no incentive to be involved, where the selling has dried up but there's no interest on the buy side either,&quot; he said.    Most of the dividend-related trading involved Philadelphia Electric, the most active Big Board issue, which carries a 12% dividend yield and goes ex-dividend today. The stock rose 1/4 to 18 1/2 on composite volume of 40.9 million shares.    Robert J. Simpkins, an analyst at Delafield, Harvey, Tabell Inc., says he expects stocks to fall during the next couple of weeks to the vicinity of their late-May lows before staging another rally. The Dow Jones industrials bottomed out May 23 at 1941.48, the average's lowest close in the past six months.    Mr. Simpkins noted that those investors who still have an interest in stocks have become very conscious of price levels and are waiting for issues to fall to acceptable levels before doing any buying. &quot;They're not going into stocks just to own stocks,&quot; he said.    G. Stanley Berge, a market strategist at Tucker, Anthony andamp; R.L. Day, said that while he expects the market to stage &quot;a modest kind of recovery&quot; during the next few sessions, stocks still appear to be headed downward. &quot;Market control is now in the hands of the sellers,&quot; he said, adding that this should become clearer once the Dow Jones average retreats below the 1900 level.    Computer stocks were well-represented among the latest session's losers, including Hewlett-Packard, which fell 1 5/8 to 44 1/4 after releasing its fiscal third-quarter earnings. The company's earnings rose to 80 cents a share in the quarter ended July 31 from 57 cents a year earlier.    Among other computer issues, International Business Machines eased 1 1/8 to 114 5/8, Digital Equipment plunged 2 7/8 to 95, Honeywell lost 1 1/8 to 60 1/4 and Unisys fell 5/8 to 31 7/8. Prime Computer, which said it expects third-quarter earnings to be more than 20% below analysts' recent estimates, plummeted 1 3/4 to 12 1/8.    Weakness in IBM and General Motors, which dropped 1 to 74, weighed on the Dow Jones industrials. Among other blue-chip issues, Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber fell 1 to 56 1/2, Westinghouse Electric lost 3/4 to 50 1/4 and USX slipped 3/4 to 28.    Meanwhile, Texaco rose 1 to 46 1/8. Two of its institutional shareholders plan to meet with the company next week in an attempt to gain a role in its nomination of directors. Other advancing issues in the blue-chip sector included F.W. Woolworth, which surged 2 1/8 to 50 1/2; Primerica, which rose 1 1/8 to 28, and American Express, which added 5/8 to 29 1/4.    McGraw-Hill jumped 3 to 68 5/8 on a report that Coniston Partners had acquired a 5% stake in the company, which has been the target of recurring takeover rumors. Coniston declined comment on the report.    Varo soared 3 3/4 to 23. The company said it received an offer from United Scientific Holdings of Britain under which its holders would receive at least $22 a share.    ASA Ltd. lost 1 1/8 to 36 5/8. The company tied the decline to the recent passage of a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives that would require U.S. citizens and corporations to dispose of South African stocks within six months, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. South African gold mining issues represent about 95% of the company's assets.    Trinity Industries fell 1 to 28 3/4. The company said production and maintenance workers at its Alabama rail car plant have been on strike since Aug. 8 and the work stoppage has interrupted some of the plant's operations.    National Presto Industries rose 1 to 28 3/4. Kidder Peabody initiated analyst coverage of the stock with its strongest buy recommendation, according to the investor report.    Veeco Instruments gained 1 3/4 to 18 1/2. The company, which disclosed in late June that it had held preliminary talks with a number of potential suitors, told the investor report that it couldn't explain the latest advance.    The American Stock Exchange index lost 0.44 to 294.13. Volume was nearly 8.8 million shares, down from nine million Tuesday.    American Technical Ceramics leaped 1 1/4 to 4 3/4. Late yesterday, the company agreed to be acquired for $5.50 a share by AVX Corp.    MacNeal-Schwendler fell 2 to 10 3/4, on flat second-quarter earnings of 18 cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
