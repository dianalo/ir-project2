The new facility, proposed by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus earlier this year and endorsed in June at the seven-nation economic summit in Venice, brings to $11.4 billion the total amount of IMF concessional financing available to the IMF's neediest members.    Observers said the facility indicates a significant shift away from the IMF's traditional role as a short-term monetary institution that provides temporary financing to countries with balance-of-payments difficulties, and toward a body that makes loans on a longer-term basis.    According to some outside observers, the IMF may now be seen in a new light as a supplier of soft loans to the developing world, shouldering more of the burden borne up to now by its sister institution, the World Bank.    But some of the IMF's biggest member countries, notably the U.S., are uncomfortable with this change in the IMF's traditional role, saying it detracts from the IMF's monetary character.    At the IMF-World Bank annual meeting in Washington last fall, Treasury Secretary James Baker said the U.S. couldn't support the facility. He explained that the U.S. has enough problems wrestling with its own budget deficit. International monetary observers also have noted that it would be highly difficult for the Reagan administration to get approval from Congress for additional development aid.    At the annual meeting, Mr. Baker said countries with trade surpluses should be the primary contributors to the pool. He didn't cite any by name, but the U.S., by far the most important IMF member, has made clear that it feels that such countries as Japan and West Germany should make the biggest financial effort.    Supporters of the new fund argue that it is in line with the IMF's guiding mission, which is &quot;to contribute to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income and to the development of the productive resources&quot; of all its 151 member countries, while fostering the balanced growth of international trade.    The IMF's European headquarters in Paris said in a statement that a &quot;large number&quot; of IMF donor countries have pledged special loans and other contributions totaling six billion Special Drawing Rights, or $8.4 billion, in additional resources for the so-called enhanced structural-adjustment facility.    That facility will complement the IMF's existing structural-adjustment facility, which currently stands at $3 billion, making a total of $11.4 billion of concessional financing available to the 62 eligible countries. The IMF didn't identify the donors to the new facility or say how much each intends to contribute.    One major donor could be Japan. Last spring, then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone pledged to &quot;recycle&quot; $20 billion in surplus Japanese funds to needy countries. That pool of money is still a long way from being drawn down.    Western European countries also could be important contributors. They have more interest than the U.S. in the countries to be served by this fund. Countries in which U.S. banks have invested heavily -- such as Mexico, Brazil and the Philippines -- won't be eligible, while many former European colonies in Africa are among the prospective recipients.    The French government has backed the new project from the start. It said earlier this year it would contribute $700 million to the fund, and yesterday, the office of Economics Minister Edouard Balladur announced that France would raise its contribution to $840 million, or 10% of the total amount of the new facility.    The creation of the new fund is seen as a personal victory for Mr. Camdessus, the managing director, who has led a nine-month crusade to convince the richest IMF member countries that the situation of the poorest nations, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, has become critical and requires urgent new measures to head off disaster.    Under the new facility, funds bearing annual interest rates of 0.5% will be made available to countries that undertake strong three-year programs to improve their balance-of-payments positions and to foster growth. The loans will be made over 10 years, including a five-year grace period. The IMF's loans traditionally have short maturities of one to 1 1/2 years, but the longer maturities of the new facility resemble those of World Bank loans.    With the new fund, eligible countries will, under exceptional circumstances, be able to borrow as much as 250% of their IMF quota, or contribution, compared with a 63.5% ceiling for the smaller fund.    IMF sources said that of the 62 countries eligible for the new loans because of their low per-capita income, India and China have pledged not to make use of the facility. The IMF quotas of the two countries are so large that if they did make use of the facility, there wouldn't be enough left for other needy countries.    The 62 eligible countries are the same that qualify for participation in the International Development Association, the World Bank's soft-loan agency. To qualify for IDA assistance, countries generally must have a per-capita gross national product of no more than $750 and lack international credit-worthiness.    More than 20 countries have arranged three-year structural-adjustment facility agreements with the fund, and IMF officials said these countries may now, if they wish, switch into the new facility with the possibility of obtaining more money. Another advantage is that the IMF will disburse funds from the new facility semiannually, unlike structural-adjustment loans, which are paid on an annual basis. </TEXT></DOC>
