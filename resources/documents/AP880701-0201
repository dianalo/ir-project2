The services will be made available under an agreement thecooperative reached with six major programming services onThursday, just hours after a House panel approved a bill requiringcable networks to sell their programming to independentdistributors.   The agreement is the first involving an independent distributorand premium cable services. The cooperative said it will add thechannels to the program package it now markets through ruralutility systems in 45 states.   Included in the agreement are HBO, Cinemax, The Disney Channel,Nickelodeon, Netlink USA and The Nashville Network.   Congress has been concerned that some cable programmers havebeen unwilling to sell their programming to third-partydistributors, thus shutting out potential competitors and deprivingthe nation's nearly 2 million dish owners of easy access toscrambled cable programming.   Most of the popular cable programmers scramble their signals.Dish owners with a decoder can subscribe directly with these cableprogrammers, but they have to subscribe separately with each.   The House Energy and Commerce telecommunications subcommittee onThursday voted 13-11 to require programmers who sell to onedistributor other than a cable company to sell to all otherdistributors. But subcommittee members also urged the industry towork out its own solution, and indicated the bill might be droppedif the industry showed competitive forces were at work in themarketplace.</TEXT></DOC>
