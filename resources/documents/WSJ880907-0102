The Dallas-based company has been trying to rid itself of the operation for some time and had the unfortunate timing to register the sale of a 20% interest to the public right before last October's stock market crash. In that filing, which was withdrawn, the company valued the unit, Pool Co., at between $264 million and $326 million.    Enserch will account for the sale, which could occur to a third party or to the public, as a discontinued operation. In the 1987 third quarter, the company earned $219,000 on revenue of $642 million. For the year, Enserch earned $30 million, or 27 cents a share, on revenue of $2.8 billion.    The sale of Pool would still leave Enserch dependent on energy prices, particularly the price of natural gas. The company's largest remaining operation would be its natural gas pipeline unit, but it has large, energy-related engineering and construction operations. Enserch also has exploration and production operations and is tentatively beginning to drill in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, in one case with the Hunt brothers of Dallas.    W.C. McCord, chairman and president of Enserch, said that the sale won't affect the company's ability to sustain its current 80-cent annual dividend and that the remaining three business segments are expected to be profitable after this quarter.    Stock market traders didn't react strongly to the news, with Enserch shares closing at $19.875, down 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    A company spokeswoman said Enserch plans to dispose of the unit in its entirety, though it has been sharply curtailing operations over the past few years because of the depression in the oil-field services industry. The unit has generated operating losses ever since 1982, including last year's operating loss of $40 million on revenue of $225 million.    &quot;It's been something that's been dragging us down for a long time,&quot; the spokeswoman said.    Pool, based in Houston, owns 580 rigs, the vast majority of them &quot;workover&quot; rigs in the U.S. that perform well servicing and maintenance in land-based fields. This part of the industry has yet to recover, because of oversupply and low energy prices. With cash flow weak because of depressed oil and gas prices, well operators tend to postpone the care of their wells.    Enserch built its oil-field services unit through many small acquisitions beginning in the early 1970s. But it has been scaling back operations through layoffs, cost cutting, restructurings and consolidations. The spokeswoman added that the company hasn't set a timetable for the sale and that she isn't aware of any talks with potential buyers.    While the disposition of Pool will involve a non-cash charge, Enserch said separately that it will establish a reserve of about $30 million to &quot;eliminate the drag&quot; of some engineering and construction operations in Alaska and London. </TEXT></DOC>
