The method makes use of NaI(TI) detector coupledwith a multichannel analyser. The 1 MeV gamma-ray of /sup 238/U was usedfor the calibration. The calibration curve was made by counting syntheticmixtures made of U/sub 3/O/sub 8/ powder, the heat treatment salt andiron in the form of fine powder. The uranium content in these syntheticmixtures was kept in the range of 1-11 per cent. 23 lots of the fusedsalt cake taken from three different batches of the salt cake were thenanalysed by this method. The uranium content of fused salt cake was foundto be in the range of 1.70-11.43 per cent. To compare the gamma spectrometricresults with a completely independent method, chemical analysis of allthe fused salt cakes were also carried out. The NDA results were foundto agree within +- 17 per cent with the chemical analysis results.</TEXT></DOC>
