A scholarly and sensitive man, desperate for understanding, he tries to explain himself.    &quot;There is a difference between racism and sound nationalism,&quot; he says, proclaiming himself a nationalist. &quot;I consider a poor, uneducated white farmer to be one of my own. I prefer him to an educated black man, who isn't one of mine. I think that's the most natural thing in the world.&quot;    He tries again. &quot;Look, it's not a matter of blacks being inferior to whites. It's a matter of being different. And we are different.&quot; And again: &quot;To be conscious of one's own race isn't necessarily racism. I am an Afrikaner, a white South African. If that's prejudice I can't help it.&quot;    Mr. Treurnicht (pronounced TROOR-nisht), who once constructed a Biblical foundation for the practice of racial segregation known as apartheid, makes no apologies for who or what he is: the anointed savior of South Africa's frightened white minority. By encouraging and exploiting white fears of racial integration and black domination, he has made his Conservative Party the fastest-growing white political movement in the country's history. In so doing, he has turned South Africa's immediate future upside down.    Two years ago, the revolution was coming from the black left. Today, with many black leaders stifled by the state of emergency here, the revolution is coming from the white right. So swiftly, in fact, that the Conservative Party is poised to make big gains in nationwide municipal elections next Wednesday and could end up as the ruling party on a national level after the next parliamentary election, which may come as early as next year. The prospect of a President Treurnicht has prompted the ruling National Party to put its tentative moves toward integration on hold and instead engage in a hopeless battle to out-white the right.    &quot;The Conservative Party motivates voters by playing on the basic fear that dominates white thinking: the black bogey,&quot; says Willem Kleynhans, a Pretoria political scientist. &quot;It is a message of fear, fear and fear again: Keep the black man in his place.&quot;    Best done, Mr. Treurnicht argues, by perfecting apartheid, not abandoning it, as the National Party has slowly been doing. His mission -- a divine calling, he believesis to reverse the tide of integration and protect South Africa's whites from the perceived tyranny of black majority rule. If that is racism, he says, so be it.    &quot;To give in,&quot; he warns during an interview in his Pretoria office, &quot;is to commit ethnic suicide.&quot; To integrate is to be overrun, he says; to share power is to lose control.    A philosopher, preacher and politician rolled into one, the 67-year-old Mr. Treurnicht mesmerizes frightened whites with that message. His philosophy, articulated in his Ph.D. thesis four decades ago, is anchored in a strain of 19th-century neo-Calvinism holding that the most fundamental definition of a person is his volk, or his nation, and that each volk, such as the broader white community, has a divinely ordained sovereignty. As a former minister in the white Dutch Reformed Church, his words command the respect Afrikaners reserve for clergy. As a politician, he is revered for refusing to sacrifice his ideals and his people on the political altar.    Mr. Treurnicht is courteous and charming, given to quoting Sartre, Calvin, Machiavelli and St. Paul. &quot;He is the Clark Gable of Afrikaner politics,&quot; says Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, the former leader of the liberal opposition in parliament. &quot;He is neat, well-dressed, smooth, and plays according to Old World rules and etiquette. He reaffirms old Afrikaner values.&quot;    Says Adelbert Scholtz, a Dutch Reformed minister: &quot;He appeals to those who feel threatened by change. They see him as their protector.&quot;    Others see him quite differently. They see his crusade as a march of folly that will lead to far greater conflict than the country already has experienced. He has been called a kook and a fascist and been accused of spreading heresy and hate. In the cruelest cut of all, a &quot;colored,&quot; or mixed-race, politician branded him a phony, asserting that one of Mr. Treurnicht's ancestors was born of a colored slave woman.    &quot;Rubbish,&quot; Mr. Treurnicht responded to the press. &quot;This latest attack is just an attempt by a colored to run down white people.&quot;    As he is a disciple of the late Hendrik Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, Mr. Treurnicht's politics are relics of the 1950s. The government then began carving up the country and herding blacks into &quot;homelands&quot; according to their tribal heritage. This policy, euphemistically called &quot;separate development&quot; or &quot;partitioning,&quot; has been proved a failure time and again by the stark demographic realities of South Africa. And many of those who touted the glories of this grand-scale apartheid -- the ruling National Party, the Dutch Reformed Church and the Broederbond, a secret society of influential Afrikaners that Mr. Treurnicht once headed -- now concede its days are numbered.    The white economy has become dependent on black labor. White businessmen have accepted black trade unions. The sheer mass of the black majority -- 26 million, to 5 million whites -- has trampled color barriers in the larger cities. Urbanization has obscured tribal lines. Most important, radical blacks aren't about to give up their demands for a unitary South African state.    &quot;You can't unscramble the egg,&quot; says Helen Suzman, who, as one of the few liberal members of parliament, often crosses swords with Mr. Treurnicht.    He will have none of this &quot;treachery.&quot; Partition -- unscrambling the egg -- must work, he says, and more and more South African whites are counting on him to make it work where even the visionary Mr. Verwoerd failed. They are eager to renounce the political and social actions of the present government, which has taken the first tentative steps toward social integration and political power-sharing with blacks, and follow Mr. Treurnicht back to the future.    &quot;The frustrating thing about the Conservative Party is that it grows on a platform that failed to materialize in the past,&quot; says Mr. Kleynhans. &quot;So what hope is there for South Africa?&quot; Indeed, many black activists would actually welcome a Conservative Party government because, they say, the battle lines would then be clearly drawn and the black revolution, stalled by the reforms and repression of the present National Party government, would erupt.    This threat is precisely why Mr. Treurnicht believes apartheid is needed now more than ever. &quot;In the long run, it's the only model that will work,&quot; he says. &quot;If a people, a volk, loses political power, in the end it loses everything.&quot;    Such talk has proved an enormously successful rallying cry for the Conservative Party. Formed as a breakaway from the National Party in 1982, when the government brought Indians and those of mixed race into the formerly all-white parliamentary system, the Conservatives captured nearly 30% of the vote in the 1987 general election and replaced the liberal Progressive Federal Party as the official opposition in parliament. Since then, the party has engineered impressive wins in three parliamentary by-elections. It now stands poised for a triumph in coming city council elections.    The power of the party's message resides in its clarity, simplicity and raw racism: No blacks in white neighborhoods. No blacks on white beaches. No blacks in white sports. No black unions in the white economy. No black programs, like Bill Cosby's, on white television. And certainly no blacks in the white government.    &quot;Dr. No,&quot; the local press calls Mr. Treurnicht. His supporters are a cross-section of whites who speak English or Afrikaans, although most are Afrikaners who toil on farms and in factories. They are zealous nationalists obsessed with the fear that their privileged life styles, language and culture would be destroyed by one-man, one-vote majority rule.    To their delight, Mr. Treurnicht likens a unitary state to the Tower of Babel, an affront to God's will and doomed to failure. For them, his words echo the Old Testament: &quot;Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of the earth.&quot;    &quot;In the long run,&quot; says Mr. Treurnicht, noting the size of the black majority, &quot;it's the numbers. We can't accommodate everyone in the same political structure.&quot; At least for whites, he insists, partition is the only policy that is fair.    &quot;What we want as whites is to rule ourselves,&quot; he says. &quot;To those who say they want a unitary state and joint rule, we say, 'Excuse us, that's not acceptable.' If you accept a unitary state, you in principle accept black domination. We say that is as unacceptable to us as white domination is to them.&quot;    Look at Europe, he says. &quot;France is for the French, Germany for the Germans, Spain for the Spaniards. Why is apartheid different? Apartheid is separateness. Separate states for separate nations.&quot; In South Africa, he goes on, &quot;to include different people, different cultures, in the same government will surely lead to conflict.&quot;    He spreads this litany across the country with the fervor and conviction of a charismatic evangelist. His campaign rallies seem like revivals, and he is the object of worship.    At a recent political rally in the primary school in the rural town of Potgietersrus, an audience that spills out into the foyer gets into the mood by singing Afrikaner folk songs, and ditties composed especially for the Conservative Party and Mr. Treurnicht. His supporters call him by his first initials, A.P.; they sing, &quot;Stay on course, Uncle A.P., we'll walk together with you.&quot;    When the singing reaches a peak, Mr. Treurnicht, dressed like a church elder in a dark suit and white shirt, appears in the hall and walks to the stage through an honor guard of well-scrubbed, awe-struck students. A minister reads from the Bible and says a prayer. A string of local party officials and candidates shower the guest of honor with such long-winded praise that listeners shout for them to shut up and let &quot;our leader&quot; speak.    When he finally does, he delivers an unscripted one-hour sermon on the divine rights of whites. His flock of believers strains to suppress its hallelujahs and amens. &quot;Mr. Treurnicht is somebody you hero-worship,&quot; says Kobus Pretorius, a retired school principal, after the speech. &quot;He will be the president of South Africa, of white South Africa, soon.&quot; There are vigorous nods from two younger generations of the Pretorius family.    &quot;He has a clear vision,&quot; says Johann Pretorius, the son. Johann Jr., the grandson, says, &quot;He's so dynamic and inspirational -- someone young people can look up to. We don't want integration, either.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
