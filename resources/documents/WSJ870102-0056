Pawnee Acquisition Inc., formed by the buyout group, paid $10 a share for the company's common stock. Certain major Pawnee stockholders, however, received $9 a share cash and $1 a share in preferred stock of the new company. Pawnee had about 2.7 million shares outstanding.    Pawnee also said it bought $12.3 million face amount of its 7 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2006 for $1,052.50 for each $1,000 face amount, plus interest accrued through the first payment date on the debt. It said the tendered debentures represent 98.7% of the total $12.5 million face amount of the issue.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
