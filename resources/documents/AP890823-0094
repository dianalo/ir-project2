That compares to a 24 percent win rate in 1985 and 1986, said thecenter, a non-profit information clearinghouse organized by mediagroups.   But Henry R. Kaufman, the center's general counsel, said it wasimportant not to overstate the trend.   ``Despite the recent slight improvement in trial success, themedia's overall trial win rate during the eight years since 1980remains at only 28 percent ... still an unacceptably poor showing,''Kaufman said in the report released Tuesday.   The center also found that large libel awards against the mediadropped in 1987 and 1988. The average amount of damages initiallyawarded was $431,730 in that period _ down from $1.167 million inthe previous period.   ``Although lower in relative terms, an average damage awardapproaching $500,000, in cases that rarely involve significantout-of-pocket loss, remains in absolute terms an unacceptably hightariff on free expression,'' said Kaufman.   There were no awards of more than $10 million during the latesttwo-year period. In comparison, from 1980 through 1986, each of thetwo-year periods had one or two eight-figure awards.   ``The absence of any outrageously inflated, eight-figuremega-awards during this period is a most welcome development,'' saidKaufman. But he said it was impossible to predict whether fewer hugeawards is an aberration or whether it will become a trend.   In addition, 14 percent of the damage awards in 1987 and 1988exceeded $1 million. In the prior two years, 27 percent did. From1980 through 1986, 25 percent of all awards against the media weremore than $1 million.   And considering cases where the initial award was under $1million _ about three-quarters of the total _ the average award was$250,518 in 1987 and 1988. That's $11,589 more than in the previousperiod, and the highest of any period studied since 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
