Police said 15 people were arrested but provided no furtherdetails of what appeared to be one of the most violent incidentssince demonstrations were made legal after martial law was liftedin 1987.   ``Riot police launched water cannons at us first. They thenwielded clubs at the unarmed crowd,'' said protest leader YangChu-chun. ``I saw at least 20 people with head injuries in a nearbyhospital, and we estimated at least 50 people were wounded''seriously.   In a statement, Taipei County Police said 14 police were hurt inthe melee.   The demonstration began Tuesday, on Taiwan's National Day, when10,000 people rallied outside the Tucheng jail in a Taipei suburbto demand the immediate release of prominent dissident HsuHsin-liang.   The protesters, wearing yellow headbands and carrying yellowflowers, shouted ``Release Hsu Hsin-liang,'' and vowed to sleepoutside the jail because they were denied permission to meet withHsu.   About 3,000 protesters remained past midnight. The fightingbegan at 3 a.m. today when riot police moved to disperse the crowd,which broke up after a two-hour clash.   Police claimed the demonstration was illegal because protestleaders did not apply for permission and said breaking up thesit-in was designed to avoid violence. The statement said Hsu'swife was among the arrested.   Hsu, 48, was jailed after he returning from the United Stateslast month, making the final portion of his journey in a fishingboat from China. The government accuses him of helping organize a1979 anti-government demonstration in the southern port ofKaohsiung.   Protest leaders said the 1979 protest was aimed only atdemanding more political freedom and that a retrial was necessary.</TEXT></DOC>
