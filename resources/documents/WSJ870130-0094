McCarthyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BLL </IN><TEXT>   Ball Corp. said it agreed to put its glass container business into a joint venture, in a move that will reduce its dependence on its original, century-old business.    The venture combines the glass container businesses of Muncie, Ind.-based Ball and Incon Packaging, a division of TBG Europe NV, of the Netherlands. The two businesses had total sales of $550 million last year. The combined company will hold about 12% of the glass-container market, ranking it fifth in the nation, Ball said.    Ball, which will own 50% of the venture, will continue to reap the benefits of a glass industry that has grown increasingly profitable in the past two years. But the arrangement also puts Ball's glass division into a convenient package that can be sold -- possibly through a public sale of the company -- if the glass market turns sour, analysts said. And Ball has said it sees plastic packaging as a much bigger growth area than glass.    &quot;They're hedging their bets,&quot; said Arthur M. Stupay, a packaging analyst with Prescott Ball andamp; Turben Inc., in Cleveland. &quot;They don't want to abandon it completely. But glass may give way to plastics.&quot;    However, Richard Ringoen, Ball's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, &quot;We are looking at this combination as a good business opportunity for our company, as well as a strengthened commitment on our part to serving the glass container market.&quot;    Ball expects to cut overhead costs by consolidating the glass operations. It has lagged other big glass companies in profitability, analysts said, because it has been committing its resources to its faster-growing core businesses -- aerospace products, and metal and plastic containers.    The venture will be a stronger national supplier to both the food and beverage industries, Ball said, and it combines complementary product lines. Ball is primarily a food-container manufacturer; most of Incon's sales are to beverage makers.    The venture, which furthers a trend of consolidation in the glass industry, will be half-owned by each company. The new company will acquire Ball's six glass container plants, its glass container mold facility and six plants owned by Incon.    Ball said it expects to report a gain on the sale, but a spokesman wouldn't specify the amount. Ball also said the venture should have a &quot;positive impact&quot; on future earnings.    The venture will manufacture Ball's consumer glass products, including its home canning line, but only Ball will sell them. The rest of the glass products will be sold by the venture.    Ball said the new company, which will be headquartered in Muncie, needs to obtain financing and government approvals. It expects the transaction to be completed in two to three months.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Ball shares closed at $40, down $1.25. </TEXT></DOC>
