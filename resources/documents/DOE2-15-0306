Thus, a simplemethod was developed for detection and correction of motion from SPECTimages using a Co-57 point source placed on the lower anterior chest,an area remaining in the camera's field of view throughout imaging. Inthe absence of motion, this point source inscribes a straight line onplanar summation of the 32 projections over 180 degrees. Movement isdetected by deviation from this line. The number of pixels of motionis used to shift images so that the resultant images of the point sourceare linear. The method of motion detection and correction was testedin 48 consecutive patients undergoing Tl-201 SPECT. The corrected anduncorrected images were reconstructed and long and short axis tomographiccuts were quantitatively analyzed using circumferential profiles of maximalcounts with comparison to the lower limits of normal. Motion was detectedin eight of 48 patients (17%). The amount of motion was 2 pixels in threepatients and 1 pixel in five patients. Quantitative defect extent wasless after correction in seven of eight patients, with a mean decreaseof 71% in patients with 2 pixel motion and 44% in patients with 1 pixelmotion. This corresponded with a definite reduction in the size of thetomographic defect by visual analysis, and closer resemblance to quantitativelyanalyzed planar images performed either before or after tomography inthe same patient.</TEXT></DOC>
