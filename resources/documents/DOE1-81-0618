<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-81-0618 </DOCNO><TEXT>The hard x-ray and low-energy gamma-ray experiment on the first High EnergyAstronomical Observatory (HEAO-1), which operated from August, 1977 toJanuary, 1979, detected 21 bursts above a limiting fluence sensitivityof 2 x 10{sup -7} ergs/cm{sup 2}. The measurement of spectral featuresconfirms the neutron-star origin for gamma-ray bursts. An emission lineat 428 +/- 52 keV and an absorption line at 66 +/- 7 keV were measuredin the spectrum of a burst on June 8, 1978. On March 25, 1978, the absorptionline shifted from 76 +/- 5 keV to 49 +/- 3 keV from one emission peakto another, the first time that this effect has been observed. Measurementsof both line and continuum variation demonstrate that these featuresare not artifacts of temporal averaging or spectral superposition. Limitson the source conditions derived from the line and continuum observationslead to a description of burst emission in which the andless;few hundred keVcomponent results from synchrotron emission near the surface of the star,while the higher energy emission, arises from pair annihilation outsidethe magnetosphere. After correctly modeling burst-selection effects,the data showed no evidence for a deviation from uniformity in the distributionsof burst fluences and positions.</TEXT></DOC>
