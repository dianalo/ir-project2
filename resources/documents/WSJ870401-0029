The move caught many analysts by surprise, especially because many other short-term interest rates fell yesterday and because most borrowing costs have been little changed for the past few months. But several analysts predicted that other banks will match the increases anyway in order to bolster their profit margins and because of fear that the dollar's persistent weakness will translate soon into higher inflation.    &quot;It seems to me the banks probably are just trying to get profitability where they can to make up for the likelihood they are going to take a big hit on their Brazilian loans,&quot; said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. He and other analysts argued that banks' borrowing costs haven't risen significantly enough in recent months to justify a prime rate boost. Added Mr. Yardeni: &quot;Watching the federal funds rate over the past several months has been like watching paint dry.&quot;    An official at Citibank, the first to raise the rate, contended that the higher rate is &quot;in line with other rates prevailing in the money markets recently.&quot; Also, business loan demand has been &quot;fairly strong&quot; lately, he said. The last time the prime rate went up at most major banks was late in June 1984, when it jumped to 13% from 12 1/2%. The prime rate has stood at 7 1/2% since last August, the lowest level in about a decade, when it fell from 8%.    The prime rate increases, announced late yesterday afternoon, sent a shiver through the financial markets. In the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues, which had staged a mild rally earlier in the day, quickly slumped, winding up with sizable declines for the third consecutive session.    Some actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds, which had been up as much as half a point at one stage yesterday afternoon, ended with declines of about a point, or around $10 for each $1,000 face amount. That brought the total drop since last Thursday to more than four points, while the yield has surged to about 7.9% from 7.55%.    The size and swiftness of the bond markets' setback startled many traders. &quot;I don't think anyone has a clear-cut explanation for what's going on,&quot; said E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;The markets are very thin and very fragile.&quot;    Fear that the dollar will continue to drop in the foreign-exchange markets continues to dominate the credit markets. Bond dealers worry that the dollar's weakness against the yen will prompt foreign investors to unload their U.S. bond holdings and drive up interest rates here. Also, a lower dollar would mean higher inflation in the U.S. as imported goods become more expensive. Thus, the Federal Reserve System can't afford to ease credit conditions, most economists agree.    &quot;Any thought of a discount rate cut by the Fed is out the window,&quot; said Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. &quot;I don't expect the Fed will shift to an aggressively tighter posture, but by the same token I don't see them easing either.&quot; He also contended that interest rates &quot;have seen their lows for the foreseeable future.&quot;    The Fed's policy-making arm, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, met yesterday to review its credit strategy. The Fed, as usual, didn't divulge what was discussed or what changes, if any, were authorized.    Although prime rate moves still command widespread attention, the rate has lost much of its significance in recent years because the nation's biggest corporations can borrow at rates well below prime. Banks say they are willing to offer cheaper loans to these companies in an effort to keep them from turning to alternative sources of credit, such as commercial paper.    Nevertheless, the prime rate, which some banks refer to as their &quot;base&quot; or &quot;reference&quot; rate, continues to affect a wide range of other borrowers. Banks use it as a base for setting rates on loans to many medium-sized and small businesses as well as on some types of consumer loans. It also affects some bank loans to foreign nations.    Asked why Citibank chose to raise its rate on a day rates on bank certificates of deposit fell, the Citibank official replied: &quot;We don't try to outguess the market each day. This isn't a day-to-day rate by any means.&quot; He also pointed out that the banking industry's short-term borrowing costs have increased since last fall.    Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist of Nikko Securities Co. International, predicted that other banks will join Citibank and Chase in raising the prime rate. For one thing, he said, bankers &quot;have had problems with non-performing loans.&quot; Secondly, he said, banks' own borrowing costs have edged higher since last fall.    &quot;I think the perception is spreading that there will be further increases in rates coming down the pike,&quot; Mr. Brusca said. Pressure for higher rates has increased, he said, partly because of the dollar's steep decline and because of growing concern that U.S.-Japanese trade tensions will lead to increased protectionism as well as higher inflation. &quot;Protectionism is equivalent to inflation in my view,&quot; he said. &quot;Higher import prices will be the breeding ground for higher inflation.&quot;    &quot;The timing of this increase is peculiar in view of the fact that many money market rates were down&quot; yesterday, said Mr. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover. He said his initial reaction to the Citibank move was that the rate increase wouldn't spread to other banks. &quot;But in view of the Chase action, I would have to say other banks will be very careful in examining their money costs,&quot; he added.    In the credit markets yesterday, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 dropped to a price of 95 1/4 from 96 3/32 Monday, while the yield rose to 7.92% from 7.84%. As recently as last Thursday, the issue closed at 99 3/8, where the yield was 7.55%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 fell to 97 17/32 from 98 1/32 Monday, as the yield increased to 7.61% from 7.54%.    Rates on short-term certificates of deposit fell as much as one-fifth of a percentage point. But rates rose slightly on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills increased to 5.77% bid from an average rate of 5.72% set at Monday's auction. The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bills climbed to 5.89% bid from Monday's auction average of 5.80%.    The federal funds rate, which averaged 6.33% Monday, fell to 5% at one point, but averaged about 6.35% for the day, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.)A) Inc. The funds rate strongly influences many other rates, including those that bond dealers pay to finance their securities holdings. The funds rate is the rate on overnight loans between banks.    The brief rally in the Treasury bond market yesterday was caused partly by an unexpected move by the Federal Reserve, traders said. The Fed bought an undisclosed amount of Treasury notes and bonds, thereby injecting funds into the banking system. Several dealers said they hadn't expected such a move at this time. &quot;The timing was early from our perspective,&quot; said Mr. Coats of Salomon Brothers.    Despite the Treasury bond market decline, municipal bond prices rallied yesterday and several new issues sold briskly. These included $250 million of refunding general obligation bonds by Illinois. The unsold balance among the underwriters as of late yesterday totaled only about $55.1 million. Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago headed the underwriting group. The underwriters priced the issue after auction to yield from 4% on bonds due 1988 to 6.90% on bonds due 2009 and 2010. The issue is rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-plus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Also selling well was a $50 million issue of revenue bonds by the Florida Department of Natural Resources. The unsold balance was about $10.3 million. The bonds were priced after auction to yield from 4.20% in 1988 to 7.20% in 2012. Moody's rated the bonds single-A, while Sandamp;P rated them single-A-minus. Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. was the lead underwriter.    Several new corporate debt issues were priced yesterday. For example, underwriters led by First Boston Corp. offered $150 million of Commercial Credit Co. 8% notes due in five years. The notes were priced at par. They are rated Baa-2 by Moody's and triple-B-plus by Sandamp;P.    Black andamp; Decker Corp. is offering $100 million of notes due in about 10 years. The 8 3/8% notes were priced yesterday at 99.83 to yield 8.40%, according to First Boston, the lead underwriter. </TEXT></DOC>
