Theycall people who spread them or commit evil computer deeds``crackers.'' They think crackers deserve jail as an example.   Most computer crimes are done not by hackers but by companyinsiders, according to BloomBecker's last survey in 1986. ``And theywere far less sophisticated than hackers,'' he notes.   Nonetheless, there may be as many as 8 million personal computersin the United States. Worldwide sales of PCs in 1986 were $50.9billion. So a lot of people have new toys.   ``Technology draws people to play with it,'' says Don Ingraham,an assistant prosecutor in Alameda County, Calif., who specializesin computer crime. And a lot of kid hackers ``gum up the works''because they don't know any better, Mandel says.   Morris, a hacker whose father was at Bell Labs and is now acomputer security expert with the National Security Agency, may havehad only an elegant prank in mind. But he made a mistake with hisworm, and it ate up disks.   Hackers who sign off on computer bulletin boards as CrimsonDeath, Phantom Phreaker, Nightstalker add a darker dimension. DaveFlory, who heads the fraud unit for the San Jose police, citesstudies and experience that indicate that 2 percent of thepopulation are sociopathic and 1 percent of them criminally so. Theytend to be brighter than average and younger males, as are thoseintrigued by computers. Flory leaves the inference standing.   But when does hacking become cracking?   A hacker has been breaking into Flory's police bulletin board andsays he won't leave unless the cops pay his phone bills to playlong-distance computer games.   ``That's extortion,'' says Flory. San Jose cops caught twoteen-agers in a phone booth trying to hook up a laptop to a phone.   ``They were in it for the sexual thrill of knowing secrets,''says Flory. But it's also attempted theft from the phone company.``They'll probably get three months at the most.''   ``Generally, the punishment does not fit the crime,'' Donn Parkerbelieves.   There are a great many gray areas. When a 15-year-old Cupertinoboy got into the Stanford University computer to change gradesStanford stored for high schools as a community service, what'sthat? A prank? Illegal entry?   What is it when somebody has invaded your computer so that a nudewoman begins appearing as you're doing your income tax, leaving youwith the message: ``You should be doing something better thanlooking at this trash''? Or the Cookie Monster that stopped yourcomputer until you wrote out ``C-O-O-K-I-E'' to its request ``I wanta cookie?'' Are these viruses jokes? Invasions of privacy?   ``Hackers know where the line is,'' says Jef Poskanzer, a30-year-old Berkeley hacker and software programmer.   ``Maybe,'' says Flory, ``but a guy who wouldn't come at you witha knife may harm you with a computer because it's impersonal. Hewon't see blood.''   ``Someone could pirate your technology, and it's not valuable toyou for eight years until the research pays off. How do you quantifythe loss?'' asks Koenig. ``What is the value of intellectualproperty? We're still struggling with this.''   If a hacker in Ithaca, N.Y., does damage to computer data inCalifornia, has he violated California criminal laws againstunauthorized access? ``It's like a guy upstream dumping pollutantsin a creek,'' says Ingraham. ``The guy downstream who waters hisstock in the creek has a case. But our national laws areinadequate.''   Computer technology moves so fast the laws lag behind. It's likethe early days of the Old West. Cattlemen moved in and grazed theirherds on open range just as hackers used to browse unhindered incomputerland. Then the sheepmen arrived and put up fences. Rangewars resulted until the law could set guidelines.   ``We don't teach breaking and entering in architectural school.Don't teach aspects of cracking in grade school,'' says Ingraham.``It's the same thing.''   Parker believes schoolchildren should be taught computer ethicsjust as they are taught computer use.   ``We teach driver education because there is an obligation totell kids what the law is before we send them out on the road.''   For the criminal, to whom ethics are immaterial, the computer hasbeen a bonanza. ``Today you can commit a crime in Berkeley from Osloif you wanted,'' Ingraham says. Jesse and Frank James had to havehorses and Colt .45s and a bag for the swag to rob a bank. Today youdon't even have to be present at the bank. The loot's on tape.   The technology has exploded to the point, Parker says, where thethief is confronted with a new problem: how much to take. ``Thesmart criminal steals below the pain threshold of the victim. Toavoid embarrassment, the company may just say take your money andgo. But the thief still has to take enough to get to Rio or hire agood lawyer if he doesn't make it.''   Computers save prostitutes the cost of a pimp. They bookcustomers via bulletin boards. Ingraham rarely sees a drug bustwhere the dealers don't keep track of business on computers.   The only secure computer is one still in the box it came in orone that never talks to another. Any further security is manmadeand, therefore, fallible.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
