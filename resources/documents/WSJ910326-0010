But some are discoveringthat subtler measures -- including moves to increaseproductivity -- are healthier for a company than mereax-wielding.   When her travel-agency business slowed late last year,Lois Eida thought she might have to lay off three of her fiveemployees. But she discovered a way to scrape by -- at leastfor now. She got New York state to subsidize her payrollthrough a so-called shared-work program. Under terms of theprogram, the employees work fewer hours -- but the state willmake up the difference in their take-home pay for as long as20 weeks.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I didn't have to lay off my employees,&quot; Ms. Eida says.&quot;And I still get to have them until the business turnsaround.&quot; At least, she hopes for a turnaround before thebenefits run out.   Managing employee costs has become one of the mostimportant recession-busting strategies for small businesses.But many small firms say they can't simply slash payrolls theway big companies often do. After all, small companies tendnot to have a lot of extra personnel to begin with, and eachemployee may play a crucial operating role. At Ms. Eida's NewYork travel agency, Lois Lane Travel, &quot;we need the continuityof service that long-time employees provide,&quot; theentrepreneur adds.   Such strategies as the shared-work program, whichcurrently is in place in more than a dozen states, arehelping both employers and states cut costs, says MargaretEighmey, a spokeswoman for New York state's labor department.She estimates that New York state has saved more than $5million in unemployment benefits since its shared-workprogram began in 1986. Nearly 300 small firms took advantageof the program in the first nine months of 1990, almost thesame number that used the program in the entire four-yearperiod after it was introduced.   Typically, small firms can qualify for shared-workprograms if they can show their sales have dropped and theymay have to lay off employees.   When business slowed down at Bardy's Diamond Center, ajewelry retailer in Greensboro, N.C., the company decided toseek help from Oechsli Institute, a Greensboro consultingfirm, to make its sales personnel more productive.   Even though sales-per-employee at Bardy's had dropped, &quot;wedidn't want to let our salesmen go,&quot; says Terry Kahn, aBardy's vice president. &quot;We felt we couldn't rehire them whenwe really needed them.&quot; Like many other small-businessowners, Mr. Kahn thinks the recession will be short-lived --and thus doesn't warrant such drastic measures as layoffs.   As an alternative, Oechsli six months ago created a &quot;buddysystem,&quot; pairing up employees. Pair members becameaccountable to the other for their performance; Oechsli saysthat helped Bardy's because employees working in pairs setmore-realistic goals and missed fewer days of work.(Employees are more willing to be prodded by peers than bysupervisors, Oechsli says.) As a result, Bardy's sales havepicked up, and it is performing better than most otherjewelers in the area, which are reporting double-digitdeclines in sales, Mr. Kahn says.   To increase the productivity of his sales staff,entrepreneur Orville Wright (no descendant of the airplanepioneer) recently moved the headquarters of his franchiseoperations from Honolulu to Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Mr. Wrightinitially started Best Instant Sign Co. in Hawaii in 1987 toproduce computer-generated signs. But after franchising hisbusiness and opening up 26 stores in Hawaii and SouthernCalifornia, he decided to move east.   Hawaii had its drawbacks, especially its five-hour (andsometimes six-hour) time difference with the East Coast, Mr.Wright says. By 10:30 a.m. in Honolulu, he notes, it is lateafternoon in New York -- leaving only two hours or so tophone many East Coast businesses before they shut for theday. Best's move to Florida should more than make up for theslowdown in the nation's economy, he says.   In St. Louis, James Brigham Jr. is giving laptop computersto the sales staff of Diagraph Corp., a maker ofbar-code-labeling systems that his family owns. Instead ofrelying on written communications, the sales staff in thefield and the central office now exchange electronicinformation about customers and their needs. The computersallow sales personnel instant access to Diagraph's centraloffices. They have greatly speeded the processing andshipping of orders, Mr. Brigham says.   Other companies are trying to hold the line on employeecosts by &quot;renting&quot; professionals instead of hiring themfull-time. Small companies all want flexibility to matchpayroll size with the volume of business they do, says JohnThompson, chief executive officer of Interim ManagementCorp., a New York concern that specializes in recruiting andplacing professionals for short-term assignments. Many smallfirms are trying to stay flexible by hiring professionals forthe short term, he says.   When a small New York apparel company, in the midst of asales slump, wanted to reorganize its business, it hired atemporary general manager, Mr. Thompson says. To put itshouse in order, the company needed someone from the outsidewho was familiar with cost-control methods in othermanufacturing businesses, he explains. Within seven months,the executive had established new reporting methods, reducedcosts -- and departed. The apparel company, which Mr.Thompson didn't identify, thus managed to get a full-timeprofessional for the short term without investing the largesums of money each permanent hire requires. Mr. Thompson saysthe company &quot;had to pay out less in benefits, and there alsowas less tumult.&quot;   Small businesses are discovering it is better to pull backand conserve resources now than to risk losing everything,says Abraham Getzler, a New York management consultant. &quot;Theyknow that every dollar they save will help them survive,&quot; hesays. &quot;They can more than get it back when the economy turnsup.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
