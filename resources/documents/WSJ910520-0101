The House is certain to reject funding for additional B-2bomber production, space-based anti-missile research andother military programs the Bush administration most wants tosave. At the same time, lawmakers are poised to keep openassembly lines and upgrade or beef up purchases of olderweapons -- from M-1 tanks to F-14 and F-16 jet fighters --that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney repeatedly has sought toterminate in order to stay within spending limits.</LP><TEXT>   Overall, the $291 billion measure for fiscal 1992, whichbegins Oct. 1, is expected to chop about $5 billion fromstrategic programs strongly advocated by the administration.The bulk of the money will be shifted to increase purchasesof conventional planes, missiles and armor, along the linesproposed by the House Armed Services Committee. Unlikeprevious years, administration supporters won't even offeramendments on the floor to fight many of the committee'srecommendations.   &quot;The Persian Gulf war hasn't really entered into thisyear's debate over the fate of major weapons,&quot; said Rep. RonDellums (D., Calif.), who led the fight against the B-2 andanti-missile research dubbed the Strategic DefenseInitiative. &quot;Everyone is focusing on the value of theseweapons systems,&quot; he said after the committee votes, &quot;and thewar isn't being used as political cover to try to confuse theissues&quot; or slip through the administration's big-ticketrequests.   Republicans agree that fallout from the war generallyhasn't helped their cause. &quot;Let there be no mistake,&quot; Rep.William Dickinson of Alabama, the ranking GOP member of theArmed Services panel, told reporters earlier this month.&quot;Desert Storm is behind us, and the defense drawdown trainhas left the station.&quot;   The administration's defense priorities are expected toreceive a more sympathetic hearing when the Senate votes onits version of the authorization bill later this summer.Personal lobbying by the president and his aides eventuallycould temper some of the strong language anticipated to be inthe House bill.   Still, the current mood among lawmakers shows that theconflict with Iraq hasn't changed the broad-based coalitionopposed to many of the Pentagon's spending proposals. In themidst of a recession, many House members increasingly aredetermined to save jobs in their districts by keeping olderweapons plants open. Others contend that many of theexpensive, advanced-technology weaponry promoted by theservices were designed to fight a large Soviet army andaren't well suited to deal with smaller-scale, Third Worldconflicts likely to crop up in coming years.   Overall deficit pressures, according to Democrats andRepublicans, mean that efforts to significantly boostspending for developing new weapons require corresponding andpolitically painful cuts in existing programs. As a result,Pentagon brass will have a tougher time getting their wishlist through the House this year than anytime in recentmemory.   The House, among other things, is expected to:   -- Freeze production of Northrop Corp.'s B-2 bombers andchop funding to less than $1.6 billion from the $4.8 billionrequested by Pentagon. Supporters of the B-2, hoping to avoida roll-call vote that would reveal the extent of oppositionto the radar-evading plane, won't introduce any amendments topump more money into the program.   -- Slash SDI-related spending to about $2.7 billion fromthe $4.5 billion sought by the White House. With its highestpriority program in jeopardy, the administration has beendrawn into a squabble over who in the military will controlthe shrinking pot. Regardless of how the House resolves thatissue, the Pentagon claims the bill won't include enoughmoney to deploy an effective SDI system.   -- Add more than $1.2 billion for F-14 upgrades andcontinued development of the V-22 Osprey, both programstargeted for elimination by Mr. Cheney. The House also isexpected to reject Mr. Cheney's arguments that production ofthe Air Force's F-16 fighters should be terminated by the endof 1993.   Before and immediately after the Gulf war, many analystsand lawmakers stressed the importance of enhanced U.S.sealift and airlift capabilities. But instead of adding moneyfor such programs, the House is expected to trim about $100million from Pentagon requests for the C-17 cargo plane,effectively reducing production rates in future years.</TEXT></DOC>
