Consolidated, which controls 8 percent of the world's annualgold production, quickly rejected the bid, which sparked concernsabout a South African monopoly in the gold mining business.   The offer by Minorco SA for the 71 percent stake it doesn'talready own in London-based Consolidated would significantlystrengthen South Africa's dominance over the Western world's goldproduction.   Consolidated is the world's second largest gold producer behindSouth Africa's Anglo American Corp., which controls Minorco alongwith De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.   Minorco offered 13.06 pounds ($21.94) worth of cash and stockfor each of the shares it doesn't already own. Minorco alreadyholds 29 percent of Consolidated's approximately 213 million sharesoutstanding, excluding options, a stake bought mainly in 1981.   On London's Stock Exchange, Consolidated's shares shot above thetakeover offer price to finish at 14 pounds ($23.52) a share, upfrom Tuesday's closing price of 10.78 pounds ($18.11).   If successful, the bid would surpass Britain's largest completedtakeover, Nestle S.A.'s $4.3 billion acquisition of confectionerRowntree PLC earlier this year, according to the industrypublication Mergers and Acquistions.   The offer for Consolidated immediately sparked a controversyeven though Anglo American and De Beers said they would relinquishcontrol of the publicly held, Luxembourg-based Minorco and Minorcosaid it plans to sell Consolidated's South African interests.   ``It would mean that Anglo American would control the goldindustry,'' said one mining analyst at a London investment firm,who didn't want to be identified.   The analyst said he expected the offer to be reviewed by theBritish government through its Department of Trade and Industry.   Tim Read, director of mining at the London investment firm SmithNew Court Ltd., noting that Minorco would be gaining control ofsubstantial gold mining operations on other continents, said, ``Interms of the dominance of gold mining, you can make a judgment foryourself.''   Sixty percent of the world's gold is mined in South Africa. Theacquisition would raise South African control to about 70 percentof the non-communist world's production, analysts said.   Analysts expressed concern that such a takeover might hamperConsolidated's businesses.   ``There may be a problem with local governments andshareholders' resentment to South African control,'' said RobDavies, a mining analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities inLondon.   South Africa's system of apartheid, which sustains whiteminority rule over a black majority, has many opponents around theworld.   Consolidated, which has been the subject of takeover rumors inrecent years, described the bid as ``lacking financialjustification'' and ``devoid of commercial logic.''   ``The proposals announced show that Minorco will be forced tobegin dismembering Gold Fields both to help finance the bid and inrecognition of the regulatory and commercial problems associatedwith South African control,'' said Consolidated Gold Fieldschairman Rudolph Agnew.   Minorco said the bid fits in with its strategy to become aworldwide natural resources group with direct operating control ofits activities.   Its current Consolidated stake ``represents too large aproportion of Minorco's assets to remain a passive investment,''the company said.   Minorco said that if its bid succeeds, it would immediatelybegin negotiations to sell Consolidated's 38 percent holding inGold Fields South Africa and would review the target's 49.3 percentstake in Newmont Mining Corp. of the United States.   The stock-swap part of Minorco's bid would result in an increasein the number of its own outstanding shares and effectively reducethe combined holdings of the company's two major shareholders to aminority stake. Anglo American's holding would shrink to 26.6percent from 39.1 percent and De Beers' to 14.3 percent from 21percent.   The wealthy South African Oppenheimer family holds unspecifiedstakes in the two companies.   Consolidated, which traces its ancestry back to the 19th centuryBritish industrialist Cecil Rhodes, has built up big stakes inmining ventures around the world. It has diverse operations andinvestments in Britain, North America, Africa and Australia,including crushed stone and coal production.   Its after-tax profit rose 29.5 percent to 212.5 million pounds($357 million) on revenue of 1.23 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) inthe year ended June 30.   Minorco holds stakes in a number of companies dealing withinvestment banking, commodities trading, industrial operations andextraction industries, primarily gold mining.   Its operating profit rose 58 percent to $104 million dollars inthe year ended June 30. It doesn't report a revenue figure.</TEXT></DOC>
