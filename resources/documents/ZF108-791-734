 Those first crude images have since beej enhanced byhigher video resolutions, vibrant color, 3-D effects -- and now--movement.andM;Nearly every business presentation provides opportunities for effectiveanimation.andP;  When two successive slides show profits down for Q1 and up forQ3, for example, the message is that net income, represented by a bar, hasrisen over time.andP;  Animator from Autodesk, explicitly reveals the motion thatotherwise remains only implicit in business graphics--for display on a VGAmonitor or for translation onto videotape.andM;Using a simple icon- and menu-driven interface, Animator puts sophisticatedinteractive animation tools into the hands of the average business user.andP;  Andat $299, Animator costs less than most charting and graphing programs.andP;  Thedifference, of course, is that such business graphics programs as XeroxPresents or Lotus's Freelance Plus create finished, if static images fromnumerical data.andP;  Dressing up the resulting pie or bar chart usually involvesnothing more than choosing a piece of clip art from a library.andM;But even the corporate user who recognizes the inherent communicatingpotential of animation must overcome the perceived barriers of generatingimages from scratch and scripting motion.andP;  This article will explain some ofthe important features of Animator's toolset and provide some basicillustrations of who to use it with ancillary programs.andM;BEGINNING WITH THE BASICSandM;On its most basic level, Animator can be described as a two-dimensionalpainting program that can perform imaging functions over time.andP;  With a fewsimple menu choices and a mouse, you can indicate the path along which a cel(or image) will travel.andP;  Then enter the number of frames Animator should useto implement the motion and you can sit back and watch as the program doesthe rest.andM;When you attempt a more detailed explanation of the program, however, lineardescriptions break down--and for good reason.andP;  Animator is structured as aseries of independent code segments linked by gateways.andP;  This organizationalfoundationi makes it possible to access essential functions, such as the TimeSelect panel, shown in Figure 1, from within any other portion of theprogram.andM;Each time you pass through a gateway into a different part of the program,Animator saves the current state and loads the necessary new code intomemory.andP;  The number of states that can be stacked is dependent upon theamount of free memory: hit the limit and the program will crash.andP;  Whileworking with the program, then, if you get the feeling that you might havelost your way in a series of operations, be aware that the stack may bedangerously near full.andP;  The practical remedy in such a situation is simply toright-click on the drawing screen, which has the effect of exiting all theway down to the base layer of your animation.andM;THE THIRD DIMENSIONandM;Most business presentations involve word charts, technical diagrams, andgraphs of numerical data.andP;  The premise of our first animation sequence,therefore, is that kinetic clip art can dramatically improve even thesimplest text message.andP;  Here, as seen in Figure 2, we have a straightforwardword chart that discusses the revenues architectural firms can realize byoffering interior design services to their clients.andP;  The rotating chair iscertainly related to the interior design theme, and it keeps the viewer'sinterest.andM;To create the illusion of a chair spinning in three-dimensional space, youmust first generate a series of two-dimensional images in which each imageshows the chair from a slightly different angle, as shown in Figure 3.andP;  Youcould, of course scan a series of photographs of a chair, in which case youwould only need to use Animator as a linking tool.andP;  A second option wouldrequire painting each view of the chair, using a program such as ZSoft's PCPaintbrush IV or Deluxe Paint II Enhanced.andP;  Unless you have the talen andresources of the Disney studio, however, this option isn't really feasible.andM;A high-end CAD program like AutoCAD, with AutoShade, has the power not onlyto render a true 3-D object, but also to plot a path around it, savingindividual files for each view.andP;  Still, however, asking a typical corporateuser to become a CAD expert seems as extreme as asking him to become aprofessional illustrator.andM;The low-tech solution I adopted required only a little ingenuity, a lot ofelbow grease, and a 3-D clip-art program.andP;  Clip 3D and its companion 3-Dmodeling program Zing! (both from Enabling Technologies) are low-cost,easy-to-use, Windows-based programs.andP;  You can create complex scenes bycombining true 3-D clip art or solid primitives.andP;  By learning to use a fewicon-based tools, you can change perspectives and camera angles or alterlighting sources.andM;Though the process was simple, I must admit finding that moving a chair 45times, in 8 degree increments, to simulate a full 360-degree turn was alaborious task.andM;After storing all 45 .PCX files on-disk, it was then necessary to translatethe images into a format Animator could accept.andP;  Animator runs in theVGA/MCGA mode of 320 by 200 pixels, displays 256 colors on-screensimultaneously (from a possible hardware palette of 262,000), and has adoptedCompuServe's Graphics Interchange Format (.GIF) as its native file format.andM;CompuServe developed and still owns the rights to the .GIF (pronounced&quot;jiff&quot;) specification.andP;  Designed for the rapid transmission of graphicsimages via modem, this particular file format is highly compressed, whichresults in efficient hard disk usage and fast display times.andP;  As the .GIFspecification has not changed since it first entered the public domain in1987, it is one of the more stable file formats available.andM;CONVERTING FORMATSandM;Zing?, like most graphics programs, exports 16-color .PCX files.andP;  And eventhough a number of other programs (notably the newest batch of paintprograms) support the MCGA standard of 320 by 200 and 256 colors, very few ofthem write the .GIF format directly.andP;  (One notable exception to this rule isMouse Systems' PC Paint 3.1.)andP;  Fortunately, however, Animator has its ownconversion utility, which can translate files written in PC Paintbrush .PCX,Deluxe Paint .LBM, or Targa formats.andM;Going through the conversion process provides hidden benefits related to theway the program handles the resolution and the color information contained inthe incoming file.andP;  When importing a 16-color .PCX file with 640 by 480pixels, the Converter program must read the entire file.andP;  Given Animator'sown resolution of 320 by 200 pixels, the image will appear to be four timesscreen size, as shown in Figure 4.andP;  If you choose to clip the image and saveonly the portion currently displayed on the screen, the conversion programwill simply map the 16 colors to a palette, leaving the 240 other colorsblank.andP;  By capturing a series of clipped screens, moving the file by one ortwo pixels before each successive capture, you can create a sophisticatedpanning effect.andP;  When this series of .GIF files are linked together, you willsee a scrolling background.andM;As also shown in Figure 4, opting to reduce (as well as convert) the 45 .PCXfiles produces not only a more appropriately sized chair but creates asofter, dithered effect, as well.andP;  Animator's Converter program downsizes animage by replacing two pixels with one and assigning the median color valueto the new pixel.andP;  In the process, the number of hues in a 16-color paintingcan quickly rise to 1,000 or 2,000.andP;  The Converter program then creates ahistogram to determine the most-common colors and remaps the image to theoptimum 256-color palette.andM;At this point, you'd probably like to load up Animator straightaway, importthe .GIF files into a 45-frame animation sequence (a flic), and then watchhappily as the upholstery twirls in space.andP;  It is more than likely, however,that this short animation of the red chair will suffer from severeflickering, producing flashes of red lightning between each frame.andP;  There's areason for this phenomenon--and a means to eliminate it.andM;In Clip 3D the surface of an object is modeled by a light source.andP;  Change theposition of an object in relation to the light source and you change thecolor, be it ever so slightly.andP;  Those initial minor color variations areexaggerated in the conversion and reduction processes, so by the time theimages are linked together to form a flic, each frame is actually using aunique, conflicting palette.andP;  When Animator tries to display the 45 images insequence, your video card must struggle to change from one 256-color paletteto the next, flashing the viewer in the process.andM;THE PALETTE MENUandM;As even this small 45-frame flic demonstrates, it is very easy to surpass the256-color limitation imposed by 8-bit video displays.andP;  Not surprisingly,&quot;true&quot; color video applications rely upon 24- and 32-bit adapters (such asTarga) that can display up to 16.7 million colors.andM;Happily, Animator's Palette menu contains several commands that can solve theall-too-common problems associated with conflicting palettes.andP;  With thetroublesome flic loaded, go through the gateway to the Palette menu andinvoke the One Palette command.andP;  This function will analyze all the colors inevery frame of your animation and create a single, shared palette.andP;  While ittook some time to perform the calculations, after Animator thus modified thepalette, the chair twirled just as it should.andM;At this point, however, the animated chair sequence is using every one of the256 slots in the color matrix.andP;  If you want to add bright backgrounds andcontrasting type, you'll have to open up a few color slots by using theSqueeze command in the Palette module (see Figure 5).andP;  Squeeze remaps colorsthat are close in value, reducing the total color count in the current frameto a user-specified number.andM;Unfortunately, however, Animator can squeeze only the palette associated withthe current frame.andP;  To create one lean and mean palette for an entireanimation, you should use a neat trick passed along by Autodesk's technicaldepartment.andP;  Using this technique guarantees that you are fairly representingall of the colors in the entire animation, not just the colors in the currentframe.andM;First, be sure that all of the frames in your flic are using one palette.andP;  Todo this, while you're in the Palette menu you should create a giant clusterthat contains all 256 colors.andP;  Exit out to the main painting screen and add anew frame to the animation.andP;  Using the box tool and a horizontal gradientink, paint a single rectangle measuring 200 pixels deep by 256 pixels wide.andO;When you squeeze this single frame, you are squeezing all of the colors inall of the frames.andM;To apply this squeezed palette to the entire animation, you must start bysaving the new palette to a file.andP;  Animator can save a multitude offlic-related files, including picture files, animation files, text files,font files, cel files, polygon files, and--as you may have guessed--palettefiles.andP;  When you reload the squeezed palette file over the current animation,Animator will ask if you want to Color Fit the screen.andP;  Answer yes.andP;  Theprogram will then remap each frame of the animation to the new reduced colormatrix.andM;But before you apply the now reduced palette to your flic, you should take amoment to think about the colors you want to use for the text and background.andO;Plan ahead: instead of mixing unrelated colors, it's a good idea to createcolor ranges that will bridge the gap between background fills and text.andM;TITLESandM;Text displayed in Animator suffers from the jaggies.andP;  Given a resolution ofonly 320 by 200 pixels, rasterization--most easily discerned in the staircasepatterns that occur on the curves of the letterforms--is bound to occur.andP;  Theeasiest way to minimize the problem is to load a blocklike typeface, such asSuperbold22, that contains as few curves as possible.andM;Another method of rounding the letter curves is to employ the (admittedlycrude) anti-aliasing tools within the paint program.andP;  Anti-aliasingtechniques use intermediate colors to trick the eye into seeing smoothercurves than are actually there.andP;  Both Unzag and Soften inks can produce thiseffect if you have anticipated the need for the in-between colors.andP;  Smallgradient ranges (background, text, and one intermediate color) work best fortext; too many colors make the type look fuzzy.andM;In our simple word chart example, dark blue text will scroll up the screenand simultaneously fade to the turquoise background color.andP;  To accomplishthis effect, the palette must contain a subtle gradation of 32 shades ofblue.andM;You start by beginning a new animation, being sure to load the palette youcreated for the rotating chair sequence and to add an arbitrary number offrames to the flic (I started with 59).andP;  Then, from the main Animator menu,you go to the Titling panel, which allows you to assign motion to a copyblock.andP;  The options you need when creating this flic call for the text toscroll up (rather than across), to be centered in the text frame (rather thanflush left or flush right), and to move in pixel increments (rather than bycharacter).andP;  The Early 14 font shown loaded in Figure 6 clearly illustratessevere aliasing on the serifs.andM;In general, even for small amounts of copy, you will find it more efficientto import the text from a word processor than to type it in directly.andO;Running a spell check on the file can save you from finding an error afteryou have rendered a 100-frame motion effect!andM;For a perfect example of how the gateways within Animator function, click onthe Do Titling button.andP;  Animator saves the information from the Titling paneland shuttles you to another module--the Time Select panel.andP;  You should planto spend a few minutes here, for the layout and icon conventions in the TimeSelect panel are idiosyncratic.andP;  For example, two identical buttons,identified only by the letter F in a box, control two different functions.andO;One button applies an animation effect to the current frame only, while theother button fills any shape you create with the currently selected color.andO;You need only learn these eccentricities once, however, because the samepanel will pop up whenever you apply motion to an element, regardless ofwhether the element in question is a text block, a cel, or an entireanimation.andM;To complete a titling sequence, you must decide whether to apply the effectsdiscussed previously to a single frame, across a section of frames, or to theentire animation.andP;  For now, choose the All Frames option.andP;  In addition, theTime Select panel gives you control over movement.andP;  For example, by choosingPing Pong, Animator will render the titling sequence and then automaticallyreverse the entire process, creating a ping pong effect.andP;  Choosing Reversewill instruct Animator to render the movement backwards.andM;Perhaps the most important function on the Time Select panel is the Previewbutton.andP;  It lets you see the actual result of your instructions withoutpermanently altering the flic.andP;  Shuttling back and forth between previewmode, the Time Select panel, the Titling panel, and the text editing framewill become second nature as you learn to make adjustments to the titlingparameters--and even to the copy itself--to produce just the right effect.andM;For example, on the first preview, I found that the dark blue type scrolledup the screen too quickly to read.andP;  Slowing down the motion required that youexit back to the Time Select panel and add more frames.andP;  The second previewrevealed that the text wasn't beginning its scroll at the bottom of thescreen.andP;  Exiting back to the text editing window, and inserting a few hardcarriage returns before the first line of text solved that problem.andM;The third preview was fine, except that all of the text was opaque.andP;  Fadingthe copy from dark blue to turquoise required exiting all the way back to thePainting functions.andP;  You don't have to worry about losing all your work up tothis point, because Animator will retain the copy and the various motionsettings in memory.andM;Animator actually contains a number of memory buffers.andP;  In addition to thetext buffer, there is a cel buffer and a screen buffer.andP;  The Swap menu givesyou access to the screen buffer, which functions as a spare page and canstore a picture in memory.andP;  If you've been following this discussion withAnimator running on your machine, you might access the swap page now and usethe vertical gradient fill to paint 32 shades of blue on the screen.andP;  Thedark blue at the bottom of the screen should make a subtle transition toturquoise at the top.andM;Return to the animation screen and select Scrape as the current ink.andP;  As thedesignation would suggest, scrape &quot;ink&quot; is not a color.andP;  It acts like aknife.andP;  In effect, it cuts a hole in the top layer of an animation, revealingwhatever image is on the spare page below.andP;  If you now reenter the Titlingpanel, click on Do Titling, and preview the flic, the scrape ink will revealthe underlying gradient fill that resides in the screen buffer.andP;  If thepreview is perfect, click the Render button and wait, while Animator paintseach frame of the animation.andM;COMPOSITEandM;Animator's flexible toolset usually gives you more than one way to create aspecial effect.andP;  For example, the same fading illusion could have beenaccomplished with two separate flics and the program's Compositing function.andO;Even for the most basic of flics--like this first animation--compositing is auseful technique.andP;  to combine the two segments, first load the chair sequenceand choose the background as the key or transparent color.andP;  Then, choose toopaque paste the incoming animation (the type) under the current image.andO;Voila!andP;  Blue text scrolls and fades behind a spinning red chair.andM;Obviously, tools such as Composite and Join become even more important as theanimattion sequences increase in complexity.andP;  And if you discover an error inone portion of the animation, you'll find that fixing it in isolation andthen recompositing the flic is the most efficient procedure.andM;Although the message of the second sample flic is rather simple, scriptingthe motion involves editing together four individual animation sequences.andP;  Ascanned photograph of the Empire State Building serves as the background.andP;  Apie chart travels across the screen.andP;  A pie slice grows in size, and severaltext items display different motions.andP;  Together, the text and images depictedin Figure 7 present the message that architectural firms in New York (theEmpire State) will contract more urban renovation projects and less new urbanconstruction in 1992.andM;This text segment is rather more complex than the titling sequences used inthe first animation, though it uses identical techniques.andP;  The first fliccontained one text frame and the movement was applied to all of the frames.andO;In this second illustrative flic, several text frames vie for the viewer'sattention.andP;  Some words are typed onto the screen one letter at a time, otherwords scroll across the screen pixel by pixel.andP;  And all of the frames begintheir motions at different times.andP;  Applying special effects to differentsegments of the animation creates the impression of alternating intervals anddurations.andM;The background scan, while it builds upon skills learned in the earlieranimation sequence, now requires a deeper understanding of the intricaciesinvolved in file importing.andP;  Scanned photographic images take advantage ofthe 256 allowable colors in the VGA/MCGA standard.andP;  However, unless you areusing an expensive third-party Service Bureau, you'll find that mostscanners--whether simple black-and-white hand-held units or full page desktopmodels--don't produce the necessary .GIF files.andM;Aimed at the DTP market, PC-based scanning software tends to concentrate on.IMG, .TIF, and .PCX formats.andP;  In some cases, Targa output is an option aswell.andP;  Animator's own Converter program does not recognize GEM's .IMG format,nor can it import .TIF files.andP;  And in 256-color mode, even the .PCX formatwon't help, because Animator can only convert high-resolution 16-color .PCXfiles.andP;  Thus, unless your scanning software is capable of saving 16-, 24-, or32-bit color Targa files, you'll find yourself having to use an externalgraphics file conversion program.andM;If you already own a copy of Electronic Arts' Deluxe Paint II Enhanced,however, you can cheat a little.andP;  Simply open up a 256-color .PCX file andthen save the file in DP II's native .LBM format.andP;  Animator treats .LBM filesas Amiga .IFF files and normally converts them with few problems.andP;  I mustreport, however, that during one particularly knotty sequence of conversions,I found that even though Deluxe Paint II Enhanced generated a working .LBMfile, Animator could not identify the image as a legitimate .IFF file.andO;Explanations about end-of-file markers aside, the nitty gritty solution wasto recapture the screen with Deluxe Paint II Enhanced's Camera utility.andM;For the long run, then, it's a good idea to get a good conversion program,such as Terravision's The Graphics Link Plus.andP;  TGL Plus provides twobenefits: it converts .TIF files to .GIF format directly, and it reduceslarge scanned images to a more acceptable size.andM;This reduction in size may be more important than you realize.andP;  Imagesscanned at 300 dpi for DTP applications tend to be very large--usually toolarge for a low-resolution, screen-based application like Animator.andP;  A littlearithmetic will show why.andP;  The number of dots (pixels) in a 320 by 200 screenis 64,000.andP;  Even when Animator's Converter program successfully reads ahigh-resolution .PCX file, it still needs to cope with only 640 by 480pixels, that is, 307,200 dots.andP;  By contrast, a 5- by 5-inch image scanned at300 dpi contains 2,250,000 dots.andP;  Even at 200 dpi--when the number drops toonly a million dots--Animator's Converter program still runs out of memory.andM;If your scanner is multibit capable--meaning that it can save images with 16(4- bit) or 256 (8-bit) colors--you can lower the resolution without any lossin image quality.andP;  With 256 colors and 72-dpi resolution the same 5- by5-inch images will look better on-screen and will contain only 129,600pixels.andM;A good rule to follow, if you have access only to a black-and-white (1-bit)scanner, is to aim for an image small enough to fit into memory but largeenough to require reduction.andP;  Scaling the picture down during the conversionprocess will introduce shades of gray into the image.andP;  Although the processdoes result in a certain amount of pixelization, you can use Animator'sSoften or Unzag inks to minimize the effect.andM;Before you go on to any other stage in this second illustrative sequence,load the scanned image as a picture.andP;  Take a few minutes to Squeeze thepalette and to create appropriatecolors for the pie chart and text.andP;  Rememberto save these colors to a palette file and to load the palette each time youcreate a new portion of the flic.andM;THE OPTICS MENUandM;Before starting a complicated animation sequence, it's always a good idea tostory-board the motion involved.andP;  Rough sketches with pencil and pad can saveyou from time-consuming mistakes.andP;  Block out the action of the pie chart inthis flic.andP;  First the pie moves onto the screen by spinning in from thebackground.andP;  Once it has reached its final position, the pie slice begins togrow larger.andP;  Even with this informal script, it's now easy to see that themovement requirements can be divided into two logical segments.andP;  And asyou'll also see, there are sometimes real advantages to rendering the flicout of order, that is, creting the second segment first.andM;To develop the pie-chart animation, start a new flic, making sure that thepalette associated with the scanned image is loaded and that the fliccontains 60 frames.andP;  To create the pie chart, first draw a filled circlewhose area is somewhat larger than you will actually need for the pie chartitself.andP;  Using the painting tools, create a small slice in a contrastingcolor and use the Get Cel command to copy the pie chart to the cel memorybuffer.andP;  Then clear the picture from the PIC menu.andM;Go to the Optics menu, from which you can assign complex motions to any oneof several objects: cels, polygons, or entire animations.andP;  Clear all theprevious instructions, and then choose Cel from the Elements menu.andP;  From nowon all of the parameters in the Optics panel will be applied to the pie chartstored in memory.andM;The Optics module is a dense collection of commands and functions.andP;  A menualong the top of the screen contains various commands, including severalpreset motions.andP;  In addition, it has a panel that lets you indicate thedegree of rotation desired and the actual path to be used for movements.andO;Animator can move a cel through any combination of x-, y-, and (simulated)z-coordinates.andM;The pie slice will seem to grow only if the pie itself spins around on acentral axis.andP;  To move the axis of rotation to the center of the circle,click on Spin and then on Center in the Optics panel.andP;  When you thenleft-click on the drawing screen, you will be presented with a wire-framerepresentation of your cel.andP;  A three-pronged axis will be positioned on theobject.andP;  Use your mouse to grab and center the axis.andM;To move the pie chart, click on Spin, then Axis.andP;  Notice that the threeslider bars in the lower-right corner of the Optics panel now represent thex, y, and z spatial dimensions.andP;  You can determine how many degrees theobject will rotate (which, in turn, determines how large the pie slice willbe) using the Spin/Turns function.andP;  The best approach is to move one sliderbar at a time.andP;  Learn how each slider bar affects the cel's movement bypreviewing a wire-frame rendition of the animation.andM;For a more accurate preview of the cel in motion, click on the Use button inthe Optics panel.andP;  Animator will save the current state and shuttle you tothe now-familiar Time Select panel.andP;  Make sure that the spin will be appliedto all of the frames in the animation and click on Preview.andP;  Render the fliconly if you are satisfied with the preview.andM;At this point the process, the pie slice moves, but it doesn't grow.andP;  Exitthe Optics menu (by right-clicking on the painting screen) and invoke theOpaque Trails option from the Special Effects list on the Flic menu.andP;  Trailswill paste each previous frame of an animation into the current frame,creating the illusion that the pie slice is getting bigger over time.andM;The curves and diagonal lines in the pie chart will display noticeablealiasing.andP;  By now, however, the jaggies and the methods employed to reducethem are already familiar to you.andP;  Just think back to the way text wasintroduced in the first animation series.andM;To get rid of the sloppy edges along the outside of the circle, create anoverlay that consists of a &quot;smooth&quot; circle--as smooth as circles get inAnimator.andP;  Join it to the pie slice either by compositing it over the flic orby using the swap page and scrape ink.andP;  You can further reduce the jaggies byapplying Unzag, or Soften inks to the pie.andM;CUMULATIVE MOTIONandM;You'll find that it is often easier to plan a complicated move if you workbackward from the end position.andP;  That's why I suggested earlier that you planto film the two pie chart segments out of order.andP;  Start by clipping a celthat contains the pie chart as it appears in the first frame of the currentflic.andP;  Now begin a new animation with at least 60 frames.andP;  The cel bufferwill still contain the pie chart in the right position even though theanimation is new.andM;Next, call up the Optics menu, shown in Figure 8.andP;  Clear the previoussettings and make sure that the movements will be applied to the cel.andP;  Sincethe settings in the Optics panel are cumulative, you can determine the spinof an object, preview the wire frame, add a pathing function, preview thewire frame, and then add a sizing function.andM;That is precisely the way you will assign motion to the pie chart in thisflic.andP;  You want the chart to move along a splined curve, spin around the x,y, and z axis, and simultaneously get smaller in size.andP;  When you previewthese motions with the wire-frame representation, the frame will start out inthe end position and move off the screen.andP;  However, once you enter the TimeSelect panel, you can choose to render the motion backward.andP;  Then, when youpreview the flic, the cel will start out as a tiny pie in the corner of thescreen.andP;  It will twirl and spin its way closer to the viewer along thepredefined path and will ultimately come to rest in exactly the locationwhere the pie chart exists in the other animated sequence.andM;When you then Join (on the Flic menu) the first segment to the second, thepie chart will align perfectly.andP;  At this point you can use Composite on theflics in any of several ways.andP;  You can opt to load the scan of the EmpireState Building to the swap page and then fill the background of the pie-chartanimation with Scrape ink.andP;  Or you can overlay two separate flics using theComposite function.andP;  Either way, bear in mind that maintaining each sectionof the animation as a separate flic takes up a considerable amount of diskspace.andP;  Up to a quarter of a megabyte may be necessary for each 230-framesection.andP;  However, if you discover (as I did) that on your first attempt, thetext becomes illegible when it's pasted on top of the scanned image, you'llbe grateful that you saved everything in the form of separate files.andM;MACROSandM;One of my favorite cookbooks absolutely refuses to list amounts foringredients such as salt, because, as the author explains, the idea is toteach you how to cook, not how to follow a recipe.andP;  In the same way, I'veavoided giving you the exact number of frames to use for text scrolls, or theexact degree of rotation to use on the pie chart.andP;  Simply reproducing thisdemo is not an end in itself.andP;  The point is rather to learn to usecomputerized animation techniques so that you can apply these skills to yourown business presentations.andM;Probably the most important skill you should have learned so far is to usethe visual feedback of the Preview function to determine what looks right.andO;Animator's real strength is in its interactive approach to creating movies.andO;If the preview doesn't please you, simply change the motion settings or alterthe colors.andM;You've learned how to convert and import images into Animator, and you'vegained experience with sophisticated Palette manipulations, as well ascomplex Titling, and Optics maneuvers.andM;When all is said and done, however, this tutorial can't teach you how toorchestrate movement so that it clarifies, rather than obscures, the contentof your message.andP;  Certainly the animations presented here are hardlyparadigms of content.andP;  But take a moment to consider the hierarchy ofmovements in the pie-chart animation.andP;  The dateline is typed onto the screenwhile the actual pie spins across the skyline.andP;  Though the effect is fun, theviewer can register the movement with peripheral vision in order toconcentrate on the text.andP;  In the same way, the main message scrolls onto thescreen in sync with the expanding pie slice.andM;In the most traditional sense, you are the director of your movie--the StevenSpielberg of the business set, as it were.andP;
