The national Centers for Disease Control said 1,123 measles caseswere reported to Chicago health officials through Aug. 23, and that78 percent have occurred in preschool children. In the UnitedStates, 9,650 measles cases have been reported in the United States,compared with 2,151 in the 1988 period.   The Chicago outbreak ``is similar to others among inner-citypopulations in the United States in that it involves primarilyunvaccinated black and Hispanic preschool-aged children,'' the CDCsaid. Blacks and Hispanics account for 94 percent of the Chicagocases.   Chicago authorities have set up at least seven new vaccinationclinics, which have administered at least 21,000 doses of measlesvaccine. Door-to-door teams have given at least 2,000 more doses,and the CDC said vaccination clinics have also been set up in fourhospital emergency departments.   Measles, a once-common childhood disease, was believed on theverge of eradication in this country in the early '80s _ just 1,497cases were reported in 1983 _ but case counts have increased since.</TEXT><HEAD>Federal Wildlife Officials to Split Whooping Crane Colony</HEAD><DATELINE>LAUREL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal wildlife officials plan to split theworld's only captive colony of whooping cranes this November toreduce the chance the flock could be wiped out by disease or naturaldisaster.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said 22 of the 54 endangeredbirds at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center would be shipped tothe International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis.   ``The service has been concerned about having all of their eggsin one basket, literally,'' said David Trauger, the center's deputydirector. ``The service felt it was the prudent thing to do, toseparate the breeding flocks, and there's enough breeders now to dothat.''   The center started in 1987 to breed the rare birds under a jointprogram with Canadian wildlife officials. The Wisconsin foundationwas selected as the home of the new flock after considering severalgroups across the nation.   Although the foundation has not bred whooping cranes, it hassuccessfully bred 13 of the 14 other existing species of cranes inthe world.   Scientists hope that by successfully breeding whooping cranes incaptivity, they will be able to establish another flock in the wild.An attempt to do that failed in 1975 when an experimental flock atthe Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho failed to produceenough eggs to sustain the colony.</TEXT><HEAD>Apache Reservation Car Death Rate Seven Times Nation's</HEAD><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Indian Health Service has determined that the2,600-square-mile White Mountain Apache Reservation in easternArizona has a car-crash death rate seven times that of the nation asa whole.   The national Centers for Disease Control said 24 people werekilled in crashes on the reservation in 1985-86, a rate of 129 per100,000 people. That's nearly seven times higher than the U.S. rateof 19 per 100,000 and three times the national rate for Indians andAlaskan Natives of 43 per 100,000.   Vehicle death rates go up as population density goes down, andthe rural location of the Arizona tribe, population 9,300, ``mayaccount in part for the elevated ... death rate,'' the CDC said.   Pedestrians accounted for seven of the 24 fatalities, and the CDCsaid new streetlights were installed along pedestrian routes inDecember.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept. 11</NOTE></DOC>
