Kiyoshi Tsujibayashi said about one out of every four shellsfired by his regiment, which manned anti-aircraft guns protectingsouthern Osaka, was a blank.   Tsujibayashi, who was a lance corporal, said soldiers weresecretly ordered to fire the blanks, which contained only a smallamount of gunpowder, beginning in June 1945 to maintain civilianmorale and avoid criticism that the military was not doing enoughto defend the people. The war ended in August.   Even when ammunition was available for the regiment's 48 guns,the shells were unable to reach the height at which the AmericanB-29 bombers were flying, Tsujibayashi said in a telephoneinterview.   Tsujibayashi, the owner of a supermarket near Osaka, said hisregiment was told in March 1945 to avoid useless firing to conservedwindling ammunition.   As the U.S. bombings intensified, ``we were told to use theblanks to avoid criticism from the public that we weren't doing ourjob,'' he said.   Tsujibayashi, 63, said he decided to share his story to letothers know about the actual situation during the war.   Defense officials were not available for comment on the report.</TEXT></DOC>
