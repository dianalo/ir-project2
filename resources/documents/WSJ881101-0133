The company has retained Touche Ross andamp; Co. as independent accountants for itself and its subsidiaries, replacing Arthur Young andamp; Co. A spokesman for Arthur Young said that the decision to end its services was mutual and that it had never given the company a qualified opinion.    American Continental also said the change wasn't related to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, which began last December, of accounting procedures used at Lincoln Savings. </TEXT></DOC>
