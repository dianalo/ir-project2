As just one example of the significance of the NFIP'soperations, as of Nov. 22 $28,658,507 had been paid forHurricane Bob losses in Massachusetts, and $3,033,623 inRhode Island. Of even greater significance were flood-losspayments following Hurricane Hugo, in 1989, of $364,240,415.   The point is that the NFIP provides the flood-insurancecoverage that you correctly note is not included underhomeowners' and similar property-insurance policies issued inthe private-insurance market.</LP><TEXT>   Obviously, the Oct. 30 storm is too recent an event tohave produced any significant figures of flood losses paid.But I assure you that there will be many millions of dollarspaid out. For example, as of Nov. 25, we have already paidout $1,019,820 for 135 of the 3,600 claims submitted inMassachusetts, and $85,582 for 42 of the 1,044 claimssubmitted in New Jersey.   C.M.
