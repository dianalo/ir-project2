Nguyen Van Thai, chief spokesman for the Ministry ofDefense.   Thai also disclosed that Vietnam will spend $5 million to moveto Vietnam the graves of Vietnamese soldiers who were buried inCambodia.   And he said two soldiers died during the six-day pullout, makingthem the last casualties in the conflict that has cost 55,300Vietnamese lives.   Several Vietnamese soldiers riding in vehicles that had brokendown on their way home were towed across the border at Moc Bai, 112miles from Ho Chi Minh City, between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday,Thai said.   Most of the soldiers had crossed by noon.   Thai made his comments to several reporters, including TheAssociated Press.   Troops at the Moc Bai border crossing were serenaded by popularsingers and cheered by thousands of children in an emotionalhomecoming earlier Tuesday.   Vietnam says it has withdrawn the last 26,000 of its troops inCambodia, although the Cambodian guerrilla resistance calls thepullout a sham.   Rebel radio broadcasts monitored in Bangkok, Thailand, onWednesday said Khmer Rouge troops launched a three-pronged attackon the gem-rich town of Pailin on the Thai-Cambodian border. Thebroadcast claimed 3,000 Vietnamese troops were defending Pailin.   Thai denied the claims about Vietnamese soldiers butacknowledged that guerrilla forces had taken some territory. Hesaid Vietnamese troops left the area last year.   The announced Vietnamese withdrawal has raised fears thatCambodia will slide into a protracted civil war. Wars and bloodyrevolution have kept Cambodia torn by conflict for the last 20years.   Of the last two Vietnamese soldiers killed in Cambodia, one diedon Sunday when the truck he was riding in overturned, throwing himinto the Mekong River. The same day, a second soldier died when heand a Cambodian soldier clasped hands as the two sped by each otherin separate trucks on Route 5. Thai said the Vietnamese soldier wasyanked from his vehicle and pulled under the passing truck.   Thai contradicted a recent report out of the Cambodian capital,Phnom Penh, which quoted the Vietnamese ambassador to Cambodia assaying Vietnam would continue giving military aid to Cambodia.   Thai claimed Vietnam has no military advisers in Cambodia andsupplies no military aid to the Cambodian government. Vietnaminstalled the Cambodian government in 1979 after Vietnamese troopsinvaded the country, ousting the Khmer Rouge regime.   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people duringits brutal rule from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion in December1978.   Thai acknowledged many Vietnamese families are angry that theirsons and husbands are buried in Cambodia and not in Vietnam. Hesaid the military would dig up the graves of the war dead and bringthem back to Vietnam.   He said many graves had been lost and remains of others werehard to find but Vietnam would mobilize itself to get the remainsback. He estimated 90 percent of Vietnam's war dead had alreadybeen returned home.   ``Still,'' he said, ``not all the mothers in Vietnam can havethe remains of their sons right now.''   Thai estimated that from 200 to 300 Vietnamese were missing inaction in Cambodia and said Vietnam would intensify its efforts tofind them.   In Ho Chi Minh City, attention turned to the returning troopsand the difficulties they will find having jobs.   The army says it has demobilized 500,000 men between 1987 and1988 and that further discharges will occur this year and next.   Col. Nguyen Huu Tinh, commander of Regiment 742, said that sincelast year 70 percent of his 1,500 men have been sent back tocivilian life. He said he worries that many of them will not beable to find work.   One veteran, interviewed at a shoe factory, said it took himthree years to find a job after he returned from Cambodia in 1986.Vo Dien Luong, 26, now works in an unskilled position glueing shoestogether. He said he wasn't satisfied with his work but that he hadto eat.   Unemployment in Vietnam is generally recognized to exceed 20percent.   Both Tinh and Luong and other soldiers and veterans interviewedWednesday said they were having trouble finding girlfriends andwives.   Some suggest that Vietnam's inability to secure a clear victoryin Cambodia has contributed to soldiers' apparent unpopularity. Butunemployment and the low earning power of a recently demobolizedsoldier are also factors.</TEXT></DOC>
