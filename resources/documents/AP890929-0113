(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker testified todaythat the fund-raising technique at the heart of his fraud andconspiracy trial occurred to him in the middle of the night as ``avision or a dream.''   ``I think fund-raising was my most burdensome job,'' Bakkertestified. ``It never left me. You never ever, ever get away fromthe pressure that you have to raise funds for next week, nextmonth, next year.''   When he left PTL, the budget was $160 million a year, ``which Ithink boils down to $3 million a week,'' Bakker said.   Under questioning by defense attorney George T. Davis, Bakkerdescribed the roots of his PTL ministry in a low voice. At onepoint, when he looked at Davis, the lawyer pointed for him to lookdirectly at the jury.   Neither his wife, Tammy Faye, nor his two children, were in thecourtroom when Bakker testified.   After describing his early years as an evangelist, Bakker talkedabout his vision to build the 2,400-acre Heritage USA Chrsitianretreat.   ``The vision from God was to build a modern Christian campgroundwhere people could worship, attend seminars and workshops,'' Bakkersaid.   As the ministry grew, he said, ``we needed to build. In themiddle of the night I woke up. It was a vision or a dream, I don'tknow. God gave me the concept of the Heritage Grand Partner Centerand I began to sketch it.''   He later described the same event. ``I woke up in the morningand began to write down the concept of lifetime partnerships. Ibrought the concept to my staff and showed it to some vicepresidents and accountants. I asked them if it would work and theysaid yes.''   Bakker is accused of bilking followers of $158 million throughthe sale of the $1,000 partnerships, which typically entitledholders to three nights' lodging a year in PTL hotels near FortMill, S.C.   Defense attorneys have claimed the partnerships were not salestransactions and that the money paid for them constituted gifts tothe ministry.   In their presentation, prosecutors presented several PTLpartners who said they sometimes were turned away when they triedto use their lodging benefits. Prosecutors contend Bakker oversoldpartnerships and diverted $3.7 million of the money to himself.   Bakker resigned from his ministry in a sex and money scandal in1987 and is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.   Bakker faces 120 years in prison and fines of more than $5million if found guilty on all the charges.   Defense attorneys on Thursday continued their parade ofwitnesses testifying to Bakker's character. By the end of the day'scourt session, at least 72 defense witnesses testified, more than50 of whom said they continue to have faith in Bakker and describedhim as a man of God.   U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter clashed with defenseattorneys Wednesday over the number of Bakker's witnesses. Pottersaid he usually allows only five character witnesses during atrial, but defense attorney Harold Bender said the witnesses weresatisfied backers important to his case.   Jurors heard Thursday from satisfied partners.   Sharon Creech, a school teacher from Rock Hill, S.C., describedher stay at Heritage Grand Hotel as ``the next best thing to being... close to Jesus.''   Lola Pinney testified she recently changed her will to leave herentire estate to the Bakkers.   Since the defense began its case Sept. 20, defense attorneysalso have shown the jury videotapes of seven PTL programs.</TEXT></DOC>
