The accord is to be announced today in Arizona. But aspokesman for the Phoenix-based Salt River Project, operatorand part-owner of the Navajo Generating Station, confirmedthe agreement, which has been secretly negotiated for months.</LP><TEXT>   Under the agreement, owners of the Navajo power plant inPage, Ariz., would install $430 million ofair-pollution-control devices on its three giant smokestacksto clean the air and improve visibility at the canyon, anational landmark 12 miles away.   The agreement marks the first time that a 1977 federal lawwould be enforced to improve visibility at national parks, agrowing concern around the country and the subject oflawsuits by environmental groups. The plume of sulfur dioxidefrom the coal-fired Navajo plant is blamed for contributing,particularly in winter, to a bright white haze that on theworst days can keep visitors from seeing across the canyon.   Pushed by environmental lawsuits, the federal governmenthad begun taking steps to force cutbacks in pollution by theplant. But utility owners were contesting such steps. Thedeal is unusual because it voluntarily brings togetherfactions that have been warring over pollution in the GrandCanyon for more than a decade. Plus, under the agreement,owners of the power plant -- five utility companies and theU.S. Interior Department -- would make even steeper cuts insulfur-dioxide emissions than proposed by federal regulators,though at a reduced overall cost than under the federal plan.   The federal government is expected to approve the deal andwrite it into a new regulation. The White House already isembracing the accord as an example of how cost-effectivesolutions can be found for environmental problems, and theagreement could spur a trip by President Bush to the GrandCanyon later this year, an administration official said.   According to people close to the negotiations,environmental groups led by the Grand Canyon Trust won a 90%cutback in sulfur-dioxide emissions by 1999, more than the70% proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency earlierthis year. The incentive for the plant's owners, whooriginally had contested even the 70% cutback, was that theycould adjust some of the technical requirements to lowertheir costs.   The agreement lowers the costs of compliance to anestimated $89 million a year, from $106 million annually asproposed under the EPA's plan. The cost savings would resultfrom giving the plant additional years to begin installingits first &quot;scrubbing&quot; devices, and from removing arequirement that a costly back-up scrubber be installed foreach boiler.   Still, the costs represent a significant expense for aplant that already burns low-polluting, low-sulfur coal andalready is cleaner than the scores of power plants targetedby new acid-rain requirements. Taxpayers will share in thecosts because the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, in the InteriorDepartment, owns the largest share of the plant, 24.3%. Otherowners are: the Salt River Project, 21.7%; Los AngelesDepartment of Water and Power, 21.2%; Arizona Public ServiceCo. unit of Pinnacle West Capital Corp., 14%; Nevada PowerCo., 11.3%, and Tucson Electric Power Co., 7.5%.   Ed Norton, head of Grand Canyon Trust in Washington, whichnegotiated for environmental groups, called the deal &quot;a verygood agreement&quot; that will benefit not only the canyon but acircle of nearby national parks. However, he said it won'teliminate haze in the canyon because it's also caused by smogfrom Los Angeles and other nearby urban areas.   The Navajo plant is one of the largest coal-fired plantsin the Western U.S. Its owners entered negotiations, whichwere informally initiated by the EPA, after contesting foryears studies linking the plant to haze in the canyon.</TEXT></DOC>
