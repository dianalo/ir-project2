At news conferences here and in two other cities, prosecutors and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation claimed that of 106 bribes offered or discussed during a 2 1/2-year investigation, 105 were accepted. And the one bribe that was turned down was rejected by an official who purportedly said he didn't think the amount was enough, prosecutors added. That official wasn't identified. Most of those charged are highway superintendents.    U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has made a name for himself recently for his successful New York City corruption, Mafia and Wall Street insider-trading criminal cases, said the latest case disclosed &quot;a broad and widespread pattern of corruption in public office from Long Island to the Canadian border.&quot; The crimes took place in 40 cities, towns and villages across the state, prosecutors said.    Mr. Giuliani stressed that the officials weren't lured by the FBI, but rather were already taking bribes from suppliers.    Part of the investigation, Operation Double Steel, featured an FBI sting operation using an agent wired for sound, posing as a salesman for a steel-products company. The company, which the FBI formed, offered $40,000 in cash kickbacks to public officials and promoted itself through advertisements and orange-colored T-shirts with the company's logo. The company sold various fabricated steel products such as metal chains and street signs. The government lost a small amount of money on the venture, prosecutors said.    The Abscam of the early 1980s case involved undercover agents posing as businessmen and offering bribes to government officials. It resulted in the convictions of a senator and several congressmen.    Early yesterday morning, about 160 FBI agents began arresting some of those charged in Operation Double Steel.    The highest-ranking officials charged were the director of purchasing for Yonkers, and the heads of public works for Port Jervis and Mount Vernon. The Port Jervis official was charged with mail fraud and the Mount Vernon official with accepting bribes. The superintendent of drains and sewers in New Rochelle also was charged with accepting a bribe. Yonkers, Mount Vernon and New Rochelle are immediately north of New York; Port Jervis is about 60 miles northwest of New York.    The Yonkers official, for example, was charged with receiving a cash kickback of $3,680 from the undercover FBI agent. But the FBI stressed the number of officials charged rather than the amount of money involved. Thomas L. Sheer, head of the FBI's New York office, said the case was &quot;broader in scope&quot; than Abscam.    In addition to the public officials, 14 principals and employees of five equipment suppliers in New Jersey and New York also were charged with paying kickbacks; nine already have pleaded guilty.    All but one of the people charged in the case were men; the lone woman is a bookkeeper at one of the equipment-supply firms, and she pleaded guilty to conspiracy.    Meanwhile, in Newark, N.J., 10 current and former local officials in New Jersey also were charged yesterday in a related kickback investigation the FBI called Operation Street Sweeper.    &quot;It is not an overstatement to say, compared with other states, (that) New York is a much friendlier place to corrupt politicians, crooked businessmen and organized criminals,&quot; Mr. Giuliani said. &quot;The laws and procedures are friendlier to them than (in) most other states that I know of.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
