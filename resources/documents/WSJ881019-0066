The loss, on sales of $157.1 million, was 25% wider than the loss of $2.9 million reported a year earlier. Sales in the latest period rose 16% from $135 million.    In the nine months, Apollo reported a loss of $1.1 million on sales of $469.5 million, against earnings of $11.2 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier.

Apollo, of Chelmsford, Mass., has been struggling to maintain profitability in the face of rising competition in the computer workstation market. The company's second-quarter loss of $7.9 million jolted Apollo shareholders, and was followed by a management reorganization in which Chairman Thomas J. Vanderslice assumed more responsibility.    Apollo shares closed yesterday at $8.25, unchanged, in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
