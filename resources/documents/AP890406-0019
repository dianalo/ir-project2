The rules are intended to prevent any conflict of interest thatmight sway researchers when they analyze the results.   Doctors who drew up the guidelines note that there are no widelyaccepted standards to prevent conflicts of interest for scientistsdoing research with products that have commercial value.   ``We believe that a defined conflict-of-interest policy willprotect the integrity of the study and the credibility ofinvestigators as the trial is scrutinized by the scientificcommunity and the public,'' the organizers wrote.   The rules were drawn up by Dr. Bernadine Healy of the ClevelandClinic Foundation and colleagues from the Montreal HealthInstitute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, BaylorCollege of Medicine, the University of Minnesota and the MarylandMedical Research Institute.   They were published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,along with an editorial by its editor, Dr. Arnold S. Relman.   ``These are laudable voluntary guidelines, which for the timebeing other clinical investigators would do well to adopt,'' hewrote.   The seven-year, federally funded study is called the PostCoronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Clinicial Trial. It willexamine the effects of drug therapy and cholesterol lowering forpeople undergoing heart bypass surgery.   During this surgery, doctors reroute blood around clogged heartarteries. However, the detours often become plugged after a fewyears, and the study is intended to see if treatment can keep thisfrom happening.   The study will test drugs produced by three companies. Accordingto the new rules, all key researchers will be prohibited fromowning stock in the drug companies or working for them as paidconsultants. The ban also will extend to their spouses anddependents.   Authors of the rules note that the outcome of this study couldaffect the care of millions of Americans undergoing bypass surgery.</TEXT></DOC>
