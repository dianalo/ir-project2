(products).andO;Product:   WordPerfect 5.1 (Word processing software).andO;Topic:     EvaluationWord Processing Software.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>WordPerfect Has Done It Again With Version 5.1andM;The good guys did it again.andM;WordPerfect Corp., seems to make a habit of confounding dire predictions.andP;  In1982, as Satellite Software Inc., it was a decided underdog, launching wordprocessing darts at a WordStar-owned community.andM;I remember a users' group meeting in 1983 in which the company founder hawkedWordPerfect with missionary fervor.andP;  We listened out of sympathy, notconviction.andP;  Yet in six months who could imagine using anything else?andM;Now 5.1 gives a thoughtful answer to more modern requirements.andP;  It is notquite desktop publishing, but much more than a word processing program.andM;The best thing about the new version has to be table creation.andP;  I did nothave to sketch out complex tabbing systems or figure out column widths tomake a table, I simply pressed Alt-F7.andP;  Column and row width adjusted easilywith cursor keys.andP;  One caution: Like all WordPerfect graphics, the table'slines must be output on a graphics printer.andM;New Spreadsheet Import brings worksheet data into a file.andP;  Link not onlyimports the information but also continually updates it to reflect changes inthe worksheet.andP;  It works with Lotus 1-2-3's.WK1 files, Microsoft Excel andWordPerfect's own PlanPerfect.andM;I had no trouble importing spreadsheet data from Lotus 1-2-3 Version 2.2.andO;WordPerfect automatically set up a table at the cursor with the proper numberof columns and rows.andP;  Updating worked as advertised.andM;Version 5.1 has some smaller new features, including a much-improved labelprinting ability that works from a simple form and one of the nicestscientific equation editors I have seen.andP;  And, wonder of wonders, theyfinally redid the tabs to include center-and right-aligned stops.andM;WordPerfect is not perfect, not yet.andP;  The outliner is still too hard to useregularly, particularly compared with Microsoft Word's.andP;  Mouse support is notcomplete; I could not use it to block an entire paragraph at once, forexample.andM;The documentation is crammed into 1,200 pages, but it is complete,well-written and illustrated.andP;  The excellent tutorial workbook and filesreflect 5.1's changes.andM;These people have been so successful because they really know how to treattheir customers.andP;  WordPerfect 5.1 continues the tradition.andP;  If you are aWordPerfect user, the upgrade is worth it.andP;  If you are not, table creationalone makes it worth a look.andM;Cynthia Morgan is GCN's associate editor for micro products and reviews.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
