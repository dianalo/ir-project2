CD4 is found on the surface of certain immune cells that are attacked by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. Scientists hope that particles of genetically engineered CD4, when injected into patients, will act as decoys for the virus, preventing it from infecting and killing immune cells.    The biotechnology concern said it is collaborating with the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a branch of the National Institutes of Health, in its clinical trials. The trials are being conducted at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital and at aone other location.    (Revised WSJ Oct. 14, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
