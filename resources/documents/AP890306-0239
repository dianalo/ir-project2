The Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office said Hisashi Shinto, 78,was arrested with his 63-year-old secretary, Kozo Murata, onsuspicion of receiving bribes in the form of bargain-price shares ina subsidiary of the Recruit Co., a conglomerate with business linksto the giant telecommunications utility.   Authorities also said they searched Shinto's home.   Shinto was known as an advocate of clean government and businessuntil December, when he was forced to resign from the chairmanshipof NTT as a result of the scandal.   Today's arrests follow the announcement Saturday that prosecutorsin the case had indicted four people on bribery charges, includingthe founder of the Recruit Co., another Recruit executive and twoformer NTT officials.   The Recruit figures were indicted on charges of offering bribes,and the former NTT officials were accused of accepting bribes.   Prosecutors suspect that in exchange for bribes, NTT gave Recruitspecial favors in the resale of U.S.-made Cray supercomputers andreduced rates on leased communications circuits, news reports say.   The Recruit scandal has shaken confidence in the government ofPrime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Three members of his Cabinet haveresigned under fire for links to the Recruit company.   A total of 10 people have now been arrested in the case oncharges of bribery or violating securities and exchange laws. Fivehave been indicted, including one who allegedly tried to bribe anopposition legislator into easing off in an investigation into theaffair.   Recruit officials reportedly sold about 687,000 unlisted sharesof the real estate subsidiary Recruit-Cosmos Co. at bargain pricesto politicians, their aides and other prominent figures throughSeptember 1986.   An estimated 160 people purchased the prelisted shares and werethen able to reap large, tax-free profits shortly after they wereoffered for over-the-counter trading in October 1986.   Shinto's secretary reportedly made about $157,000 and Shintoearned about $71,000. When the transaction was revealed in detail inDecember, Shinto said he had not known of it and that his secretaryhad controlled the account.   Shinto had headed NTT since 1981 and oversaw its conversion to aprivate company during the administration of former Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone, who was among politicians whose aides orrelatives profited from transactions in the stocks.   Takeshita, who is also among those figures, has repeatedly denieddirect involvement in the scandal.   On Sunday, he took responsibility for the scandal but pledged torestore confidence by pursuing political reform, a published reportsaid.   ``The Recruit case ... surfaced during my term as prime ministerso there is no way for me to escape responsibility,'' Takeshita wasquoted as saying in today's editions of the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.   The prime minister, however, ruled out opposition party demandsfor the resignation of his entire Cabinet.   Public support for the Takeshita Cabinet has dropped steadilyover the past five months due to the scandal, as well as governmentplans to levy a 3 percent tax on all services and goods incommercial transactions, according to media polls.</TEXT></DOC>
