After more than a year of trying to line up financing, Mr.Blair has teamed up with Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc.,the leveraged buy-out arm of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., to buy the2,400-screen movie theater chain -- the largest in the nation-- and theater-related assets.</LP><TEXT>   According to Securities Data Co., the transaction is thelargest leveraged buyout announced since July, when a groupled by Blackstone Group proposed an acquisition, sincecompleted, of Six Flags Corp. for $710 million.   The United Artists deal also is one of the largestinvestments to be financed by Merrill's $1.5 billion buy-outfund, which has invested about half its assets in 10acquisitions since its formation in 1988. According to oneperson close to Merrill Lynch, financing for the acquisitionwill include more than $100 million in equity from the fund,$92.5 million in preferred stock to be held by TCI, bank debtof $275 million to $300 million, and senior notes of $125million to $150 million to be sold privately.   The sale rids cable-television giant Tele-CommunicationsInc. of a business in which it has demonstrated littleinterest. Tele-Communications acquired 54% of United Artists,which also included cable systems, in the mid-1980s, andacquired the remaining 46% last November for $1.1 billion instock and cash.   While eager to keep the cable properties,Tele-Communications has long been expected to sell thetheater chain. Other than Mr. Blair, there haven't been anyseriously interested buyers, according to people familiarwith the company. Theater chains are no longer selling at themultiples they fetched in the 1980s, and United Artists'properties aren't ranked among the highest-quality, moderntheaters in the industry.   Yesterday, in national, over-the-counter trading,Tele-Communications shares closed at $16.50, up 50 cents, onvolume of almost 1.9 million shares.   Mr. Blair said the parties would try to close thetransaction, which is subject to third-party considerations,by March 31.   He headed United Artists Entertainment from 1987 untilDec. 2, when TeleCommunications acquired the remaining stakein the company. Both companies are based in Englewood, Colo.   The theater chain has screens in 502 locations throughoutthe U.S. and Puerto Rico. Mr. Blair said that during the nextfive years he plans to &quot;dispose of&quot; between 500 and 600screens in geographically undesirable areas, and to add about400 screens in other locations.   &quot;We're going to spend a lot more time thinking where weput our theaters and how we design them,&quot; said Mr. Blair. &quot;Wealso have some good ideas about audio systems for thetheaters.&quot;   &quot;I'd classify this as a minor positive for TCI,&quot; said KenGoldman, an analyst with Bear Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;TCI neverconsidered this to be a strategic asset. This just simplifiesthe company further.&quot;   &quot;The price is in line with what people in the theaterbusiness would call reasonable,&quot; said John S. Reidy, a mediaanalyst with Smith Barney Harris Upham andamp; Co. &quot;It looks like afair deal for both parties.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
