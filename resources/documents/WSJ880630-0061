As previously reported, Viacom plans to sell its Long Island cable systems serving about 130,000 subscribers as part of a plan to pay off debt following a leveraged buy-out of the company last year by National Amusements Inc. According to the industry executives, Cablevision, which is based in Long Island and operates several major cable systems there, is expected to pay close to $2,800 per subscriber, or in excess of $350 million.    Cablevision and Viacom declined comment. Cable systems have been selling at increasingly higher prices, though $2,800 is at the top end of the range of recent transactions. Cablevision is said to be considering paying top dollar to increase its hold over the Long Island market, one of the more affluent areas of the country and long a region where consumers have spent heavily on cable television.    In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Cablevision closed unchanged at $34.    Cablevision is the 11th-largest cable operator with just over one million subscribers. The company hasn't been an aggressive acquirer of systems in past years, but has more recently begun to expand in both cable systems operation and programming. Its Rainbow Programming Enterprises subsidiary operates five regional SportsChannel networks in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, New England and Florida, and last week acquired exclusive rights to the National Hockey League games for $50 million. </TEXT></DOC>
