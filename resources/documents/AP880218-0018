But House Speaker Jim Wright said Wednesday that other crucialquestions about the aid package, which is scheduled to come to theHouse floor next week, remain unanswered.   Unresolved are such difficult issues as how the aid will bedelivered, its duration, and what kinds of incentives might beoffered to Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government to encouragecompliance with a regional peace accord.   ``It is taking shape,'' Wright, D-Texas, said of the proposal. Agroup of House members, primarily Democrats, has been meeting dailyto work out details of the bill, which was promised as analternative to the administration's $36.2 million aid packagerejected on Feb. 4.   In contrast with the administration's package, which included$3.6 million for ammunition and anti-aircraft missiles and millionsmore for non-lethal military supplies, Wright's proposal would belimited to food, clothing and medical supplies and assistance.   The $1.8 million monthly figure does not include transportationcosts, which currently are costing a like amount each month butcould be lower if the aid were delivered by an international,neutral organization such as the Red Cross.   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., who is leading the draftingsessions, said the bill also will include a program to aid childreninjured during the six-year civil war.   Wright said under consideration as well is a possible lifting oftrade sanctions against Nicaragua and economic aid to othercountries in the region, contingent on fulfillment of promises ofdemocratization made in the five-nation peace agreement.   But he emphasized that such moves could be made only with the``enthusiastic'' backing of the administration, which would becharged with carrying them out. So far, the administration andRepublican congressional leaders have declined to participate indrafting the legislation.   Wright said the bill will seek to provide ``balancedincentives'' to encourage both the Contras and the Sandinistas towork out a cease-fire and live up to the peace agreement signedlast Aug. 7.   Both Wright and Bonior appeared cool to the idea, mentionedearlier by House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., that thelegislation would include a ban or restriction on fund-raising forthe Contras by private U.S. citizens.   ``I know of no provision contemplated,'' Wright said when askedabout the issue.   Meanwhile, a congressional opponent of aid to the Contras askedPresident Reagan to strengthen assurances that U.S. governmentpersonnel will not again become mired in private fund raising forthe rebels as it did in the Iran-Contra affair.   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., also asked that Reagan clarify thetax-exempt status of a fund the Contras have established to solicitprivate contributions from U.S. citizens.   Last week, White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. andnational security adviser Colin L. Powell issued a memorandumdirecting that ``no administration official'' provide aid toprivate fund-raising efforts for the Contras.   But because the memorandum was not issued by the presidenthimself and was addressed only to White House and National SecurityCouncil staff members, Contra opponents have questioned whether thedirective contained an important loophole.   Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations foreign operationssubcommittee, noted that federal law prohibits such activity andthat all federal officials, including those at the State Departmentand CIA, should be covered by the White House prohibition.   He also raised questions about the Contras' fund-raising arm,the Nicaraguan Resistance Education Foundation. Contributions tothe fund are tax-deductible.   Obey noted that the fund had been created last October simply bychanging the name of another organization that already hadtax-exempt status, the John Davis Lodge Foundation forInternational Studies.</TEXT></DOC>
