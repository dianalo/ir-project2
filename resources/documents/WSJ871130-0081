BrowningStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP MDEST </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   France said yesterday that it wouldn't press charges against an Iranian Embassy translator accused of involvement in a 1986 wave of bombings.    The follow-up to the release of two French hostages by pro-Iranian terrorists in Beirut Friday triggered speculation that France and Iran have cut a deal to end their &quot;embassy war.&quot;    Neither country has revealed details of their negotiations. But the evidence is growing that both are keen to end the feud that led to the rupture of diplomatic relations in July and the virtual imprisonment of both countries' diplomatic staffs in their own embassies since then.    French officials also announced they are moving toward settlement of a financial dispute under which Iran is demanding repayment of the remaining two-thirds of a $1 billion loan made by the shah to a European nuclear energy project.    The officials warned against prejudging the terms of an apparent deal with Iran. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said during a previously scheduled television appearance that &quot;we are in a process that I hope will lead to normalizing relations,&quot; and he added that the process &quot;isn't yet over.&quot;    Other officials said they won't be prepared to discuss details of their negotiations until they are completed.    But some of the consequences already are clear. The sudden agreement yesterday by the Iranian interpreter, Wahid Gordji, to be questioned by French authorities, followed by their announcement that they hadn't any charges against him and his subsequent hasty departure for Tehran, seems likely to end the embassy war. Iranian officials appeared ready to drop the countercharges of espionage and drug smuggling they had announced against a French diplomat in Tehran, who himself was questioned yesterday by an Islamic court there. Once the two men are free, nothing would stand in the way of repatriation for the other French and Iranian diplomats who have been sequestered in their respective embassies.    France's major objective in improving relations with Iran has been to win release for hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Beirut. Since taking power in March 1986, the government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has won release for seven French citizens, but three more remain.    The two men released Friday night, television sound engineer Jean-Louis Normandin and free-lance reporter Roger Auque, had been held by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Justice Organization.    The weekend events seem likely to boost the political fortunes of Prime Minister Chirac just five months before next year's presidential election. To date, polls have generally shown Mr. Chirac finishing behind two other likely contenders in the race, former Prime Minister Raymond Barre, a fellow conservative, and President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist. But he has always scored well on law-and-order issues, where his image is tougher than that of his rivals.    The decision to release Mr. Gordji without charging him is potentially controversial, and could turn out to be a political gamble for Mr. Chirac. Late last night, however, it had been criticized only by the leader of the far-right Front National, Jean-Marie Le Pen.    In an unrelated development, police announced the capture in a shoot-out Friday of the last remaining leader of the left-wing terrorist group Direct Action. The seizure of Max Frerot, a bombing specialist, was another feather in the government's cap. </TEXT></DOC>
