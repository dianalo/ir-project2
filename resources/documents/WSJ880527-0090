U.S. Energy Secretary John S. Herrington has recently been nurturing the relationship because he thinks Iraq's oil reserves eventually will be equal to or greater than those of Saudi Arabia, which currently holds the world record for petroleum resources with 170 billion barrels of proven reserves.    Moreover, Mr. Herrington said in an interview, &quot;The friendly Arab countries and the U.S. want stability in the Persian Gulf -- and that equals Iraq.&quot;    Issam Abdul Rahim Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, is currently in the U.S. -- at Mr. Herrington's invitation -- for visits with both government and oil-company officials regarding Iraq's burgeoning oil industry. He is the first Iraqi oil minister to come to the U.S. since the countries resumed diplomatic relations in 1984.    Arriving here yesterday after visiting Washington earlier this week, Mr. Al-Chalabi told a news conference that Iraq has proven oil reserves of 100 billion barrels, &quot;second only to Saudi Arabia's,&quot; and that it has a production capacity of four million barrels a day, which will be increased by 500,000 barrels by new fields now being developed.    The minister declined to say how much Iraq is currently producing, except to note that output has come down from last November's peak of 2.8 million barrels a day. Even so, he said, Iraq is currently producing more than Iran's quota under the production restrictions in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    &quot;My production is over (Iran's quota of) 2.36 million barrels a day,&quot; Mr. Al-Chalabi said. Iraq, which has been at war with Iran for more than seven years, refuses to accept an OPEC production quota unless it is given parity with the Iranians. As a result, Iraq is excluded from the quotas agreement of the 12 other OPEC members.    &quot;The position of Iraq is very clear to everybody,&quot; Mr. Al-Chalabi said. But he added that a majority in OPEC &quot;supports the position of Iraq, and we would be more than happy to be a party to that agreement.&quot; At the OPEC meeting beginning June 8, he said, &quot;I am hoping the Iraqi quota (issue) can be solved.&quot;    Because of the war with Iran, in which the U.S. is officially neutral, Iraq isn't able to export oil by tankers through the Persian Gulf. But by late next year, when Iraq's pipeline expansion program is to be completed, it will have an export capacity -- by pipelines alone -- of 3.15 million barrels a day, Mr. Al-Chalabi said. At the war's end, reopening of its Persian Gulf export facilities would add an additional 2.5 million barrels a day of capacity -- much more than Iraq will need over the next several years, he said.    Mr. Al-Chalabi cited &quot;possible cooperation in the field of energy between Iraq and the U.S.&quot; as one of the reasons for his visit here. In addition to Washington meetings with Mr. Herrington and other officials, Mr. Al-Chalabi said he is holding talks with oil companies although &quot;nothing specific&quot; is being discussed. &quot;We are encouraging participation of American oil companies in the development of our industry,&quot; he said.    In the interview, Mr. Herrington said that Iraq's growing oil potential and its ability to export increasing amounts through pipelines are &quot;significant&quot; and coincide with the interests of the U.S., which is protecting Persian Gulf oil tankers from Iranian attacks. &quot;Our underlying national interest is the free flow of oil,&quot; he said, citing Iran's threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow outlet through which Persian Gulf oil tankers must pass. </TEXT></DOC>
