Bush, meeting with visiting Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister PrinceSaud Al-Faisal, said: ``They are engaged in a mission that comeswith the greatest of intentions and met with the strong,enthusiastic support of the United States, as they try to be helpfulin bringing peace to Lebanon.''   The meeting, scheduled for a half-hour, lasted more than 75minutes. Saud emerged from the White House to tell reporters: ``Ishall convey to our leaders when I get back that we have the fullsupport of the United States government in this regard, and this issomething we are very pleased with.''   He said Bush gave ``a very positive response to the preparationthat has happened so far.''   ``We agree on the objective and we agree that the machinery thatwe are following now is a good machinery that requires support ofall actors on the Lebanese question,'' said Saud.   The Saudi official told the president, ``We're going to work veryhard on this.''   Reporters, on hand to witness the opening of the Oval Officemeeting, overheard Bush reply, ``I think the kingdom (Saudi Arabia)in such a key role and such a respect level, that perhaps youractive involvement will make the difference.''   ``All communities in this country are concerned about it, as I'msure you know from your knowledge of the States,'' Bush told thePrinceton-educated Saud. ``Then when I was in the Vatican, why they,His Holiness (Pope John Paul II) expressed a grave concern aboutit.''   ``So the fact that you all are taking this initiative is mostappreciated by everybody. So we'll see what happens,'' the presidentsaid.   When reporters asked about the initiative, Bush replied:   ``I'm anxious to visit with the foreign minister of Saudi Arabiaon that. But they are engaged in a mission that comes with thegreatest of intentions and met with the strong, enthusiastic supportof the United States, as they try to be helpful in bringing peace toLebanon. That's something we're all very much concerned about.''   The Arab League has been attempting to negotiate a truce inLebanon between Syrian-backed Druze forces and Christian militia.   Fifteen foreigners are believed being held hostage in Lebanon,nine of them Americans, including Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press.   The Arab League, at a summit in Casablanca, Morocco, in late May,appointed Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and two other leaders tospearhead efforts to negotiate peace between the warring Moslems andChristians in Lebanon.   The league gave Fahd, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algeria'sPresident Chadli Bendjedid six months to pursue the settlement.   They were charged to supervise a cease-fire, reconvene Lebanon'sparliament, arrange the appointment of a president and amend theconstitution to provide a better political balance between thefeuding Moslems and Christians.   The league's peace overture envisions a pullout of Syrian troopsfrom Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
