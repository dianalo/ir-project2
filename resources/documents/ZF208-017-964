 Occasionally, theseproducts are designed for commercial reasons.andP;  For example, Microsoft gaveaway a 'Turbo Pascal to QuickC' translator when QuickC was released.andM;The most common operation for language translators to perform is to go fromBASIC to C.andP;  It's often assumed that these products are cashing in on the Cbandwagon, by offering an opportunity for programmers to take code written ina quiche-eaters' language and convert it into something that they're notashamed of showing to friends and colleagues.andP;  If you speak to people who useBASIC-to-C converters, though, you get a different picture.andP;  The main use forsuch a product is as a way of getting existing DOS programs running underUNIX.andP;  Many consultants and one-man-band software companies have writtenbespoke applications for business clients.andP;  As clients move from DOS to aUNIX environment, they will call the consultant and ask for a UNIX version ofthe software he originally wrote for them.andP;  The consultant knows that decentBASIC compilers for UNIX are few and far between, and doesn't want to have torewrite the whole thing from scratch in a language that he's never used.andO;Equally, he doesn't want to turn away business.andP;  Enter a ready-made marketfor language translation packages.andM;Of course, maintaining source code in one language and translating it toanother before each compilation is not the best way of working.andP;  Ideally,you'd write and maintain the source code in C.andP;  However, there are a numberof reasons why this is not always possible.andM;ProgrammersandM;With C becoming more and more popular, good programmers are hard to find andare not cheap.andP;  There are still many more BASIC than C programmers around,partly because BASIC is so widely taught in schools as a first language.andO;Also, anyone who buys a home computer will almost certainly get a BASICinterpreter with it.andP;  So, any self-taught techie will probably know BASIC.andO;Although the school situation is changing, with Pascal becoming an importantlanguage, it is still BASIC that most people know.andP;  Compared with C, BASICprogrammers are plentiful and cheap.andP;  The current reputation that C has meansthat no company will admit to writing commercial software in BASIC, but itcertainly goes on.andM;SpecsandM;Programs tend to evolve much faster than specifications or documentation.andP;  Toconvert any application from one language to another, you should work from adetailed specification rather than the original souce code.andP;  How many specsdo you know that get fully updated each time a minor change is made to thesoftware?andP;  Usually, minor hacks and work-arounds are made with startlingregularity, with little or no mention of the amendment being made anywhereapart from in the source code itself.andP;  For this reason, it often pays toleave the source code alone.andP;  This is even more true if anyone (even just oneperson) who worked on the original code is no longer with the company.andO;Chances are, there will be features in the code that no one else understands,and it will be safer to leave them alone.andM;Taking TimeandM;A client calls and says he's just converting to UNIX and could you possiblyconvert the stock control application that you wrote for him.andP;  It's all tooeasy to say that yes, it can be done, and that you'll have it for him in aweek.andP;  If you don't, he'll probably go somewhere else.andP;  However, a programwritten in compiled BASIC on a PC is not easy to convert to a UNIXenvironment, and won't be until Microsoft produce a UNIX version ofQuickBASIC.andP;  Until then, the easiest way is to run the source through alanguage translator.andP;  Of course, some manual work will still be involved tocope with areas that cannot be converted, but much of the conversion can bedone with a single pass through the translator.andM;MoneyandM;Time is money, and software development takes time.andP;  Obviously, if you haveto spend a coupld of months converting a BASIC application to C, this timemust be converted to money and added to the selling price of the program.andP;  Ifmost of the conversion can be done automatically, you end up with a productthat runs on two hardware platforms for the price of one.andM;CompatibilityandM;Converting Microsoft BASIC programs to run under UNIX is always going tocause problems.andP;  Files on the PC have carriage-return/linefeed pairs at theend of each line, whereas the UNIX standard has only a carriage return.andP;  PCshave box-drawing graphics characters for constructing menus and otherdisplays, whereas Vaxes do not.andP;  The PC organises keyboard scan codes andscreen addresses in a non-standard way.andP;  All these facilities need extrathought if you're converting manually.andP;  A translator like B-Tran, fromLutton-based Sector 7, takes care of all these conversion difficultiesautomatically.andP;  The Company even claims that B-Tran is currently availablefor 33 different versions of UNIX.andP;  With so many different versions, it'scertainly easier to concentrate your own mind on just one operating system,and leave the final details to someone else.andM;DisadvantagesandM;Of course, writing in BASIC and converting to C before each compilation isnot ideal.andP;  BASIC is an unstructured, untyped language and thus it isdifficult to make the converted code take full advantage of a C compiler'scapabilities.andP;  The C code produced is often little more than a largecollection of subroutine calls and #define statements, which simulate theoriginal BASIC code in layout and structure (or lack of it).andP;  There willalways be facilities in the source language that cannot be translated intothe target language, and there will always be minor modifications that mustbe performed by hand on the target source code.andP;  You will need, therefore, atleast a modicum of C expertise.andM;Roger Dalton is a freelance journalist specialising in personal computers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
