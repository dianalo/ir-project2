The leaders, seeking a new stategy toward South Africa,conditionally adopted a policy document outlining six preconditionsfor talks between the South African government and opposition groups.   They said the conditions, long demanded by African NationalCongress guerrillas, were needed to create a climate necessary fornegotiations. The congress drafted the summit declaration itself.   The document said talks could ``create the possibility to endapartheid through negotiations.'' It said the government of SouthAfrica had the ``urgent responsibility'' to accept such talks.   The four-day African summit was attended by seven African headsof state on its opening day Monday.   Its declaration, adopted by the 16-member Organization of AfricanUnity ad hoc committee on Southern Africa, will be presented to thenext summit of the 101-member Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade nextmonth.   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia is expected to discuss theprospects for talks in South Africa when he welcomes acting SouthAfrican President F.W. de Klerk to Zambia on Monday.   Besides ending the emergency and lifting bans on anti-apartheidgroups and individual activists, the Harare summit's conditionsincluded the removal of all troops from South Africa's blacktownships, releasing all political prisoners and ending politicaltrials and executions, and a government commitment to free politicaldiscussion.   Only then could the government and its opponents discuss acease-fire, the formation of an interim government, and aconstitution for a non-racial democratic South Africa based onone-man, one-vote, the declaration said.   ``We support the position of the majority of the people of SouthAfrica that these objectives, and not the amendment or reform of theapartheid system, should be the aims of negotiation,'' the leaderssaid.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   African and Western diplomats, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said while the declaration was couched in conciliatoryterms, it did not represent a significant new departure byguerrillas fighting in South Africa or African leaders.   For its part, South Africa has long insisted the African NationalCongress and the smaller, rival Pan Africanist Congress guerrillagroup renounce violence before any talks.   The Harare declaration said South Africa's black majorityreserved the right to pursue armed struggle and strongerinternational economic sanctions against South Africa.   The 16-member ad hoc committee of the Organization of AfricanUnity, chaired by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, includesAlgeria, Angola, Botswana, Cape Verde, Congo, Ethiopia, Mali,Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the AfricanNational Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress and the South-WestAfrica People's Organization.</TEXT></DOC>
