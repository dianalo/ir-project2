The recombinant B chainwas detected by labeling the transfected cells with [{sup 35}S]methionineand [{sup 35}S]-cysteine and demonstrating the secretion of a proteinwith a M/sub r/ of 30,000-32,000 that was not present in the medium ofmock-transfected COS-M6 cells. This protein was specifically immunoprecipitatedby an anti-ricin or anti-B-chain antibody and the amount of recombinantB chain secreted by the COS-M6 cells was determined by a radioimmunoassay.Virtually all of the recombinant B chain formed active ricin when mixedwith native A chain; it could also bind to the galactose-containing glycoproteinasialofetuin as effectively as native B chain.These results indicatethat the vast majority of recombinant B chains secreted into the mediumof the COS-M6 cells retain biological function</TEXT></DOC>
