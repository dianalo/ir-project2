But they are already wrong onthe first count, and it is beginning to look like they may bewrong on the second as well.</LP><TEXT>   The recession that officially began last July now is inits 10th month, making it as long as four of the eightpost-war recessions. And it isn't looking all that mild. Theeconomy contracted at an annual rate of 2.8% in the firstquarter, and troubling data continue to roll in. Unemploymentclaims keep rising. Orders for new machinery and sales of newautos still show no evidence of recovery.   &quot;There really are no signs that this recession is over,&quot;says Robert Hall of Stanford University, chairman of theNational Bureau of Economic Research business-cycle datingcommittee. As is often true, the latest economic indicatorsaren't all pointing in the same direction. &quot;As for magnitude,the signs are mixed,&quot; Mr. Hall says. &quot;It's a moderaterecession to date.&quot;   The economic signals certainly are confusing. On the onehand, stock prices are soaring, and the stock market has anexcellent track record of predicting rebounds in the economy.Also, the battered housing industry is starting to recover,and inflation shows evidence of moderating, perhaps to a rateof 3% to 4% in the months ahead.   All of these tend to be early signs of a recovery, butother indicators suggest that the recovery hasn't arrivedyet. Auto sales and machinery orders are still falling. Itwas largely because of these fresh signs of continuedeconomic weakness that the Federal Reserve Board reducedinterest rates a notch further this week. With so muchconflicting information, the Fed decided to take out a littleanti-recession insurance.   Even if the economy is bottoming out, or is close toreaching bottom right now, that represents more of a downturnthan many economists were forecasting just a few months ago.They miscalculated, and now they are recalculating.   Last October, the WEFA Group, a Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., economicforecasting firm, predicted a six-month recession, with arelatively mild contraction in the fourth quarter of lastyear and the first quarter of this year giving way to a surgein output right about now. Now it predicts that the economywon't grow at all this quarter.   What went wrong? Larry Kimbell, head of WEFA's U.S.forecasting unit, says he was sure the Gulf war would forcean increase in defense spending and goose the economy; itdidn't. &quot;We had one of the most bizarre wars in history,&quot; hesays. &quot;We had declining defense expenditures in the mostintense bombardment in history.&quot;   Moreover, he says, consumer euphoria hasn't yet translatedinto consumer spending, particularly for cars. And exportgrowth, though strong late last year, is beginning to taperoff because of slowing economies and recessions abroad.   &quot;The underestimation of duration and severity of recessionis a common error,&quot; says Victor Zarnowitz, a University ofChicago economist who has been tracking economic forecastingfor decades. &quot;There's a natural optimism, particularly inbusiness people. They can't survive without it. Economistshave the same propensity -- and they also have a strongbelief in equilibrating forces.&quot;   The seeds of an expansion have to be planted within thenext several months, says Robert McGee, senior vice presidentof Tokai Bank in New York. &quot;Consumer spending is clearly themost important thing that has to improve.&quot;   There have been few signs so far of an upturn in autosales. But there are some grass-roots hints that a reboundmay be at hand. Ray Green, a major auto dealer in southernIllinois, is more optimistic than he was just three monthsago. An operator of five dealerships, Mr. Green has alreadyseen a significant upturn in sales of &quot;nearly new&quot; cars,often from rental fleets. Next, he expects new-car sales torebound, and he recently stepped up his orders from bothGeneral Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.   &quot;We ran a clearance sale two weeks ago and we had thebiggest {customer} traffic count since 1988,&quot; says Mr. Green.And although the company only closed deals on 20% of theprospects -- his target is a 25% closing rate -- Mr. Greensays car loans are plentiful and consumer interest genuine.   An auto sales rebound is one of the factors that could getan economic recovery rolling. An upturn in sales wouldencourage auto makers to increase output, thereby bringingfurloughed auto workers back onto the assembly lines andrestoring their purchasing power.   Consumer sentiment has rebounded since the end of the Gulfwar two months ago, but consumer spending hasn't. The reason:Consumers don't have the wherewithal to spend. On this score,many economists see something that looks more like the end ofthe decline rather than the beginning of a signficantrecovery.   &quot;The worst of the squeeze on purchasing power is behindus,&quot; says Robert Marks, president of SOM Economics Inc. Henotes that oil prices have dropped significantly since thewar-related spike last year. But offsetting this is a rise instate and local taxes and a significant decline in employmentand in hours worked. &quot;Consumers can't spend confidence,&quot; saysCharles Lieberman, an economist with Manufacturers HanoverSecurities Corp.   The extent of the layoffs has surprised some analysts andhas certainly weakened the overall spending power ofconsumers. For some reason, employers appear to have beenquicker to let workers go in this recession than in therecent past. Usually, the economy contracts and then thelayoffs start. This time, that was reversed. In all, 1.4million jobs have been lost since the recession began inJuly, a decline of 1.3%. Although the economy was contractingfar more rapidly in the opening months of the 1981-82recession, 1.2 million jobs were lost in the first eightmonths, also a 1.3% decline.   Today, the Labor Department is scheduled to release theunemployment figures for April and, according to analysts'forecasts, the jobless rate could reach 7%, up from 6.8%. Thenumber of people filing initial claims for unemployment hasrisen sharply since mid-1990, and has yet to begin to turndown.   &quot;The employment numbers are rotten,&quot; says Robert Manningof Axe-Houghton Management, a Tarrytown, N.Y.,money-management firm. He sees little hope of a meaningfuleconomic rebound until new unemployment claims start droppingand until the number of hours worked, another widely watchedindicator, also begins to rise. The unemployment rate usuallykeeps climbing for a few months after a recovery begins,largely because businesses don't add workers until they arecertain that business is better.   The dismal jobs picture also extends to the temporary-helpindustry. The industry boomed in the 1980s, partly byconvincing employers to hire temporary workers in good times.The underlying premise was that the temporary people could belet go in an economic downturn, and today that work force israpidly contracting, having fallen almost 10% from a year agoto slightly over one million workers.   &quot;You have to go back to 1982-83 to find numbers that areworse. And I see virtually no signs of revival&quot; in thetemporary-help industry, says Peter Yessne, president ofStaffing Industry Analysts, a Cupertino, Calif., firm thatstudies the temporary-help market.   On a recent 10-day fact-finding trip across the country,Mr. Yessne found some worse-than-expected job markets. Forexample, he says, the temporary-help market is weak inChicago, which has been considered a fairly resilient economyin the current recession. He notes that suburban areas are abit stronger, however, and that the U.S. divisions of foreigncompanies are holding up fairly well as employers oftemporary workers.   Another sector of the economy where unemployment couldkeep rising is in state and local governments. The budgetaryproblems are severe enough that about 35 states will havebudget deficits by the end of fiscal 1991, says AnthonyHutchison, an official of the National Conference of StateLegislatures. Already, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and otherstates have instituted temporary furloughs of workers andhave eliminated jobs through attrition and retirements. InCalifornia, voters recently forced the state legislature toslash its own budget by 40%, which will probably forcecutbacks among the nearly 3,000 people on the legislature'spayroll.   The large-scale impact of the poor job situation is thatit reduces consumer spending power. What some consider a moreprecise measure of employment -- total hours worked -- isalso declining.   Gloomy as these developments may be, job loss tends tolag, rather than lead, economic downturns. And quite a feweconomists believe that the worst of the unemploymentsituation may be occurring now.   One bright sign is that consumer spending power isincreased by lower inflation, and prices show strong signs ofmoderating. A wide consensus of economists has come tobelieve that the &quot;core&quot; rate of inflation (which excludes thefluctuations of commodities prices) is moderating to a levelof about 3% to 4%. And with lower inflation could comefurther declines in interest rates, including long-termrates.   Lower long-term rates, if they occur, would help solidifythe rebound in housing that already seems to have begun. Homemortgage rates have dropped below 10%, and may fall further.And even at the current rates of about 9.5% for a 30-yearfixed mortgage, some of the most disastrously affectedhousing markets of the Northeast are seeing a rebound inbuyer traffic and resale of homes and even an uptick inhousing starts and building permits.   The anecdotal evidence of a housing turnaround in theNortheast is impressive. A recent survey of real-estateagents by Prudential Securities Inc. found a sharp turnaroundbetween November 1990 and March 1991. In November, forexample, 76% of consumers were &quot;less willing&quot; to buy a home,and only 3.6% said they were &quot;more willing&quot; to buy. By March,those figures had changed drastically, with 95.2% ofconsumers reported as &quot;more willing&quot; to buy a home. Onetrouble spot: a continuing glut of unsold condominiums in theNortheast.   Indeed, the housing industry is one sector that seems tobe stirring, an important sign because sales and constructionof new homes often begin to climb several months before theend of a recession. This is among the indicators that MichaelBoskin, the president's chief economic adviser, refers to as&quot;the preconditions that usually precede a recovery.&quot;   But many economic seers say they won't be confident that arecovery is at hand until auto sales perk up and factoriesbegin to report an upturn in orders, rather than a slowingrate of decline.   Until then, prudent forecasters may be taking their cuesfrom a Yale University economics major from the Class of 1948named George Bush. Asked by reporters the other day when heexpects the recession to end, the president replied: &quot;Wouldyou settle for a general `sooner rather than later?'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
