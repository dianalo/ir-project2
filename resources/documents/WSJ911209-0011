The agreement, filed in U.S. district court here, wouldsettle a class-action lawsuit charging Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.,Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. withmisleading investors about the riskiness of the mergerbetween InterFirst Corp. and RepublicBank Corp. and withignoring strong indications that the deal was unsound. FirstRepublicBank's failure just 14 months later still stands asthe costliest such collapse in U.S. history.</LP><TEXT>   In the filing, all three firms deny any wrongdoing andstate that they want to settle to avoid further legal expense&quot;and to put to rest all further controversy.&quot; An attorney forthe Salomon Inc. unit declined to comment, and otherspokesmen for the firms couldn't be reached for comment.   But documents produced in connection with the litigationsuggest that regulators, investment bankers and officials atthe two banks were all too willing to overlook problems inthe banks' portfolios in their rush to the altar. In apreview of the current merger mania in the banking industry,proponents argued that combining the two crosstown rivalswould save them so much on overhead that they would return tohealth.   Subsequent regulatory examinations disclosed thatRepublicBank, in particular, had wildly overstated the valueof its real estate loan portfolio by, for example, failing toupdate appraisals even though the market was sinking.Internal memoranda showed that InterFirst executivesdiscovered RepublicBank hadn't recognized nearly as much inreal estate losses as InterFirst, even on loans the twoshared.   The investment banks' role included underwriting a $200million issue of new securities to recapitalize the mergedbanks. Additionally, Goldman Sachs, as adviser to InterFirst,issued a &quot;fairness opinion&quot; stating that the price to bereceived by the bank's shareholders was sufficient. MorganStanley, the adviser to RepublicBank, counseled shareholdersof that bank that the deal was fair. The three investmentbanks received about $12 million for their part in themerger.   The proposed settlement, which remains to be ratified bythe court here, calls for a $20.2 million payment by GoldmanSachs, $15.9 million by Morgan Stanley and $5 million bySalomon Brothers. Morgan Stanley would pay an additional $1.1million to settle a related complaint filed in Houston statecourt.   The beneficiaries, numbering in the thousands, wouldinclude investors who purchased certain securities before themerger as well as those who participated in the $200 millionrecapitalization. In an earlier settlement, insurers of FirstRepublicBank's former directors and top officers agreed topay investors $19.5 million.   Still to be dealt with are the complaint's allegationsagainst Ernst andamp; Young, a successor to Arthur Young andamp; Co.,RepublicBank's accounting firm. The firm, which has deniedwrongdoing, said in the most recent court filing that it has&quot;insufficient information&quot; to reach a settlement.   Terrell W. Oxford, a Dallas attorney for the plaintiffs,said a trial is set for February for the Ernst portion. &quot;Wejust haven't been able to make much progress on that front,&quot;he said. &quot;We'd be delighted either to try this case orsettle.&quot;   First RepublicBank, which filed for bankruptcy-courtprotection in 1988 after its banking units were taken over byfederal regulators, isn't related to First Republic Bancorp.of San Francisco.</TEXT></DOC>
