Iliescu said he was contemplating creation of a national guardto protect the government. He said it would be composed ``of clean,loyal, honest people who can act resolutely at exceptional times.''   ``We know that we can rely on you,'' Iliescu told the minersFriday before sending them home. His comments were carried onRomanian radio and monitored by the BBC.   The center of the city was quiet Saturday. Helmeted police withautomatic weapons guarded government buildings and UniversitySquare, the site of a 53-day anti-government rally that riot policeended Wednesday by firing on demonstrators.   The state news agency Rompres said six people were killed and502 injured in violence from Wednesday through Friday, the worst inRomania since the uprising that toppled Communist dictator NicolaeCeausescu in December.   At least 110 people were still hospitalized, seven of them withvery serious injuries, Rompres quoted Health Ministry officials assaying.   Security officials detained 1,021 suspects in theanti-government rioting, the government said Saturday.   The miners had been asked to restore order on the square.Protesters gathered there had demanded ex-Communists like Iliescube banned from politics.   The miners, swinging iron bars and clubs, swarmed Bucharest onThursday and Friday, attacking anyone they suspected of beingagainst the government.   Among their targets was the headquarters of the NationalPeasants Party.   Standing there Saturday among shards of broken glass, smashedtypewriters and furniture, party secretary-general Liviu Petrinasaid the struggle for democracy would continue.   ``Emotionally we are ready to start today,'' he told a reporter.``Logistically, it could take weeks.''   The Liberal Party headquarters also were trashed by the miners.   Calin Tarceanu, a Liberal Party official, said leaders ``areafraid for our lives, because nobody is protecting us.''   Dinu Patriciu, another party official, said the Liberals would``continue to function as a free political party'' despite theintimidation.   The miners injured or threatened other government critics andstudent leaders who contended Iliescu and other key figures of thegovernment sought to revive totalitarian rule.   They also threatened to close down four opposition publications.One, the Romania Libera daily, said Saturday it had not resumedprinting because its workers feared a threat by the miners toreturn and destroy the paper's offices even if the governmentallowed it to reappear.   Iliescu blamed the anti-government riots on right-wingextremists, whom he charged were aided from abroad.   ``We are dealing here with a broader scenario of Europeanproportions,'' Iliescu said. ``There was a joint action ofright-wing forces, which started from the presumption thatright-wing forces in all East European countries could come topower.''   Radu Campeanu, leader of the opposition Liberal Party, toldreporters Iliescu's accusations were childish and ``part of an oldCommunist pattern.''   Although Iliescu and his National Salvation Front governmentoverwhelmingly won free elections last month, his critics demandedhe and other former Communist Party leaders be banned from politicsfor 10 years.   The Front's dominant role since Ceausescu's overthrow has leftother political voices little room to express their views except onthe street.   There was still no word Saturday on why miners were summonedinstead of relying on police or soldiers to re-establish order.   Speculation about tensions between the interior and defenseministries intensified after the state Rompres news agencypublished an open letter, apparently from the army, disavowingresponsibility for the clashes with anti-government demonstrators.   Western governments condemned the violence.   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday thatall but humanitarian aid would be withheld, and the EuropeanCommunity postponed a trade and economic agreement with Romania.   The miners, among Ceausescu's most outspoken critics, havestrongly backed Iliescu, who gave them pay rises and improved theirworking conditions soon after taking power.</TEXT></DOC>
