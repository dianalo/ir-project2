Authorities say seven guards, one prison cook and an inmate werecharged as a result of ``Operation Ferret,'' an investigation begun18 months ago.   ``The investigation will potentially yield the largest number ofarrests related to official misconduct by correctional officers inthis country's history,'' District Attorney Ronald Castille told anews conference Tuesday.   ``We are gathering the evidence to present to the special grandjury that will lead to the arrest or discipline of hundreds ofguards over the coming months,'' Castille said.   The crimes include selling drugs to inmates, bringing money andother contraband into the city's five prisons and providinghandcuff keys to aid escapes, Castille said.   ``The investigation will lead to the exposure and elimination ofa massive network of corruption and criminal activity amongself-serving Philadelphia prison employees and prison inmates,''Castille said.   Prison Superintendent Edward Lyons acknowledged that employeestargeted in the investigation will continue to guard inmates untilcharged. He said the situation will pose no security problems.   ``We have a sufficient number of employees to handle thesystem,'' Lyons said. ``We have stepped up recruiting activities.And as soon as charges are filed by the grand jury, we will suspendand fire.''   The prison system houses up to 9,000 inmates and employs 1,400guards and 350 other workers.   The two instances cited in the grand jury's report involved oneguard, the cook and an inmate in an escape and six guards in abeating that hospitalized an inmate who reported a guard sleepingat his post.   Castille declined to say how many escapes guards allowed.   Police Commissioner Kevin Tucker said a federally financedOrganized Crime Law Enforcement Network aided the investigation,which according to Castille relied on undercover officers,cooperating inmates and guards and electronic surveillance.   Guard Dennis Tiest, 42; prison cook Stanley Suder, 37; andinmate Kenneth Lynch, 39, were charged with helping inmate JohnLongendorfer escape from the Laurel Hall minimum-security unit in1987.   Longendorfer, who was serving time for terroristic threats andindecent assault, cooperated in the investigation, allowingauthorities to videotape the escape, according to court documents.   Suder accepted a $1,000 bribe and a 1987 Pontiac Grand Am,Castille said.   The six other guards were charged with an unprovoked physicalassault on inmate William Kennedy on Feb. 16.   Those charged were officers Edward Ricks, 32; Sammie Rogers, 41;Clemon Davis, 35; Christ Taylor, 50; Charles Favano, 44; and Sgt.Peter Jones, 50.   Castille said the investigation of the assault uncovered otherreports of brutality.   ``There is no question there is a serious problem within thewalls of the prisons, and with these arrests, starting now, we hopeto send out two messages,'' said Lyons.   ``One, to those employees engaged in criminal activities that wewill find them and arrest them, and to those employees whodischarge their services with pride, we say to them that we needyou.''   Other corruption cases in Philadelphia have resulted in theconviction of 34 police officers since 1983 on federal bribery andconspiracy charges. They included a deputy commissioner forextorting money from vice figures. Twelve judges were suspendedlast year for allegedly accepting cash from Roofers' Union members.Three of the judges have been convicted of bribery in recent months. </TEXT></DOC>
