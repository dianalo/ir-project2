Bishop (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GNEX </CO><IN> PHA </IN><TEXT>   Scientists at Genex Corp. said they have developed tiny genetically engineered proteins that could compete with monoclonal antibodies in many of their uses.    The tiny proteins should be able to &quot;home in&quot; on and cling to the surfaces of cancer cells, hormones and other natural proteins in the same way that monoclonal antibodies do, the Genex scientists claimed. Moreover, the tiny proteins are free of some of the drawbacks of monoclonal antibodies, researchers said.    Monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized medical diagnosis and treatment in the decade since they were developed. By zeroing in on proteins in the blood, urine, bacteria and viruses, they allow doctors to deliver drugs directly to specific sites and to make far more rapid diagnoses. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize hormones appearing in the urine in the early days of pregnancy, for example, are the basis of new rapid do-it-yourself pregnancy tests.    Researchers learned several years ago how to make these versions of the antibodies that the body produces to fight off foreign invaders. They culled single clones, or monoclones, of antibody-producing blood cells from mice and reproduced them in the laboratory.    The researchers at Genex, which is based in Gaithersburg, Md., reported in this week's issue of Science magazine that they have taken a major step beyond monoclonal antibodies. They say they have designed and produced in the laboratory just that part of an antibody that recognizes and binds to a target protein. Specifically, they synthesized the binding portions of three different monoclonal antibodies, including one that in the laboratory bound itself to bovine growth hormone.    The part of the antibody produced by the Genex team is about one-sixth the size of a complete antibody, Robert E. Bird, head of the Genex team, explained in an interview. Because antibodies themselves are proteins, the portion designed and synthesized by the researchers is a tiny protein, dubbed a &quot;single-chain antigen-binding protein.&quot;    &quot;Single-chain antigen-binding proteins are expected to have significant advantages {over monoclonal antibodies} in clinical applications because of their small size,&quot; the Genex researchers claimed.    In diagnosing cancer, for example, monoclonal antibodies against specific types of cancers are tagged with radioactive tracers and injected in the body. Radiation detectors can then pinpoint the cancer's location by spotting where the radioactivity concentrates. However, radiologists must usually wait a few days for the unbound radioactive antibodies to clear out of the body before they can pinpoint the tumor. Otherwise it would appear falsely that cancer cells were sprinkled throughout the body.    Because of their small size, radioactive-tagged single-chain proteins that don't bind to cancer cells should clear out of the body much faster than unbound monoclonal antibodies, making radioactive imaging of tumors possible much earlier, the Genex researchers said.    The single-chain proteins also should avoid the confusing tendency of monoclonal antibodies to bind to some normal cells, distorting images of a tumor's exact location, the researchers said. Mr. Bird said experiments with animals are now getting underway to prove the tiny protein's imaging qualities.    The single-chain proteins, like the monoclonal antibodies, also can be used to carry lethal charges of radioactivity or chemicals to cancer cells and possibly into the nooks and crannies of the tumors that aren't reached by the larger monoclonal antibodies, they suggested.    Another potential advantage of the single-chain proteins is that they might not be as likely to trigger an immune reaction in the patient. Most monoclonal antibodies are made from mouse cells and patients tend to build up an immunity to them after they've been injected with them once or twice. This limits their use to one or two diagnostic or treatment sessions. In theory, the much tinier single-chain proteins shouldn't be as &quot;immunogenic&quot; as the full antibodies, allowing for more treatments.    The reported experiments involved making single-chain proteins of the binding portions of three particular monoclonal antibodies. The Genex scientists said, however, &quot;we are confident we can produce active single-chain antigen-binding proteins with the sequence of any monoclonal antibody.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
