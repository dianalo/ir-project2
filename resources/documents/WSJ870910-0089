The offer appears designed to maintain existing contract differences between U.S. and Canadian auto workers, who previously have declined to accept lump-sum wage payments like those negotiated in the U.S. between Chrysler and the United Auto Workers union.    Neither Chrysler nor the Canadian Auto Workers union would elaborate on the terms of the company's offer, which was made five days before the union's strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. next Tuesday. But William Fisher, Chrysler's chief Canadian negotiator, said the offer also included increases in certain pension benefits.    Robert White, president of the Canadian union, rejected Chrysler's offer, saying it &quot;fails completely&quot; to address the issue of cost-of-living adjustments for pensioners. The union has made inflation-indexed pension payments its top priority in talks with the Canadian units of Chrysler, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Chrysler shares rose 12.5 cents, to close at $43.    Current contracts at GM and Ford also expire next Tuesday. The Canadian Auto Workers, which represents 64,000 employees at the three auto makers' Canadian operations, earlier chose Chrysler as its target for a strike or possible pattern-setting agreement.    Mr. White called the offer by Chrysler Canada Ltd. &quot;a blueprint for a strike.&quot; But one union official said privately that the contract offer -- the first made by Chrysler -- wasn't a detailed basis for an agreement. He said Chrysler could make a more elaborate offer by this weekend.    Chrysler's Mr. Fisher seemed to hint at the same possibility. He described the offer as &quot;a foundation&quot; for a new contract. &quot;You never really say at this stage of the game that you've made your final offer,&quot; he said.    Still, Mr. Fisher said the two sides are &quot;quite a ways apart&quot; on economic issues. He said Chrysler remains opposed to inflation adjustments for retirees, despite a proposal by the union to limit the size of such adjustments.    The Canadian Auto Workers declined to elaborate on its plan for limiting the proposed pension adjustments. But a union official said it would effectively reduce the cost of such payments to Chrysler to about half the cost estimated by the company.    Mr. Fisher said previously that granting cost-of-living adjustments to the company's 4,000 pensioners would add more than 3.00 Canadian dollars ($2.28) an hour to the company's hourly wage and benefit costs, which total more than 20 dollars an hour. </TEXT></DOC>
