The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 6.43 to 2,162.14as of 10 a.m. EST.   Declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about5-to-4, with 415 stocks up, 533 down and 556 unchanged on the NewYork Stock Exchange.   Big Board volume totaled 17.82 million shares after the firsthalf-hour of trading.   Larry Wachtel, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,said today's early decline was due in part to an ``overextension ofthe blue chips.''   However, he said, the main problem on Wall Street was traders'continuing concerns about interest rates. Those concerns were fueledin part by a survey by the National Association of PurchasingManagement that indicated the economy remains robust, Wachtel said.   With the economy running at a strong clip, the financial marketsexpect the Federal Reserve to raise its discount rate.   ``There's no sign of a rate peak,'' Wachtel said.   Traders were looking toward Friday's release of employment datafor December for further clues about the Fed's intentions, he said.   Declines in the dollar and Treasury bond prices today alsocontributed to the decline on Wall Street, analysts said.   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was Philips Petroleum,up [ at 19|.
