This verity was proved once again in the pages of thisnewspaper on Oct. 2. &quot;Scenes From a Scandal -- The SecretWorld of Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky,&quot; adapted from JamesStewart's just-published book on the Wall Streetprosecutions, suffers from a fatal flaw found in manyinvestigative journalism books that appear long after thedaily news stories have become old hat. It becomes necessaryto publish, in Mr. Stewart's words, &quot;major, newly revealedepisodes,&quot; which usually means relying on sources notpublicly disclosed during civil, regulatory and criminalproceedings.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Stewart has not only not found any new facts (hemerely recycles old and discredited accusations), but herelies on witnesses among whom were those not called by theJustice Department in the one proceeding where Mr. Milken'sattorneys had the right of cross-examination -- thesentencing hearing held before Judge Kimba Wood. Thesewitnesses were rejected by the government for good reason.   The centerpiece of Mr. Stewart's rendition is the story ofMichael Milken and Ivan Boesky conspiring to violateinsider-trading laws in connection with a proposed merger ofDiamond Shamrock and Occidental Petroleum Corp.   According to Mr. Stewart's account, Mr. Milken's firm,Drexel Burnham, obtained confidential information on Thursdaynight, Jan. 3, 1985, that a merger proposal would beannounced the next day. Mr. Stewart charges that thefollowing morning Mr. Milken illegally leaked details of thestock swap deal to Mr. Boesky, with a Drexel trader, JamesDahl, listening in on Mr. Milken's end of the conversation.Mr. Boesky, according to Mr. Stewart, promptly placed ordersto buy Diamond and short Oxy.   This account runs smack into documented facts. It is amatter of record that Mr. Boesky had a long-standing interestand large investments in many oil and energy stocks,including Diamond Shamrock and Oxy. Indeed, four days beforethe proposed merger was announced -- and the leak alleged tohave taken place -- Mr. Boesky already had an investment of$45.5 million in Diamond Shamrock common and $13 million inOxy warrants.   More important is the fact that Mr. Milken possessed noadvance, insider information about the merger, as thegovernment's own investigation demonstrated. Drexel did notlearn of the structure of the proposed merger until Fridaymorning, rather than the night before as alleged by Mr.Stewart. Indeed, it is indisputable, based on Oxy's sign-insheets for Jan. 4, 1985, that the Drexel team did not arriveat Oxy's offices in Los Angeles until 9:05 a.m. PST onFriday, corresponding to 12:05 p.m. EST in New York.   Under these circumstances, it is obviously impossible forthe Drexel team to have learned of the proposed exchangeratio until afternoon in New York, and for Mr. Milken to havemade the early morning telephone call to Mr. Boesky thatpurportedly prompted the insider trading. Besides, sworndepositions demonstrated that no one on the Drexel nor theOxy team passed this information to Mr. Milken.   Moreover, Mr. Boesky could not have traded on insideinformation that morning for another reason: Trading inDiamond and Oxy was suspended on the New York Stock Exchangeprior to the opening of the market Friday morning, pendingthe announcement of the merger terms.   Mr. Stewart's account contains a core of reality, aroundwhich is woven a massive fantasy. The core of reality to theDiamond/Oxy story is that Mr. Milken did indeed converse withMr. Boesky with respect to this deal.   Mr. Dahl testified that he overheard Mr. Milken advisingMr. Boesky to sell Diamond after a public announcement thatits negotiations with Oxy had ended, not that he hadoverheard Mr. Milken tip Mr. Boesky to purchase Diamondshares before the announcement of the proposed merger, as Mr.Stewart says. This was, on Mr. Milken's part, perfectlylawful advice. This is the reason the government did not evenask Mr. Dahl about this when he appeared at Mr. Milken'ssentencing hearing.   Mr. Stewart's claims of a host of other &quot;inside trades&quot;are as fantastical and as far from the truth as is theDiamond/Oxy account. The government, with all its resourcesand power over witnesses, was unable to prove a singleinsider trading charge against Mr. Milken because noneoccurred. Drexel's chief equity trader testified that henever saw any insider trading by Mr. Milken. But the mostauthoritative word on insider trading allegations was that ofJudge Wood, who made the following finding: &quot;I am unable tofind that Michael Milken traded on material, nonpublicinformation.&quot; Judge Wood's findings are a matter of publicrecord -- yet Mr. Stewart never mentions them.   Mr. Stewart's descriptions of personal shortcomings of Mr.Milken are no more accurate. Take, for example, assertionsthat Mr. Milken had become greedy and megalomaniacal. Toprove this, Mr. Stewart claims that Mr. Milken asked, whilechatting with salesman Gary Winnick, &quot;What do you think it'dcost to buy every building from here to the ocean?&quot;   That story is a twisted retelling of a version of astandard speech that Mr. Milken liked to deliver concerningoften-expressed American fears in the 1970s that oil sheikswould soon own the entire country. The transcript of hisspeech shows that he said that after calculating the assetsavailable to the sheiks, &quot;we discovered these Middle Easterncountries did not have enough money to buy all of FifthAvenue, Michigan Avenue and Wilshire Boulevard. Therefore itwas unlikely that they were going to be able to buy the wholecountry.&quot; On other occasions, he used as the example thevalue of all buildings from his office &quot;to the ocean.&quot;   And allegations of Mr. Milken's insensitivity to Mr. Dahlwhen the latter learned that his mother had cancer runcontrary to what just about anyone who knew Mr. Milken wouldhave told Mr. Stewart, had he asked. Mr. Milken was obsessedwith cancer's ravages, having lost a father, a stepfather, amother-in-law and several aunts to the disease.   In a typical situation, when a Drexel security guarddeveloped acute myelogenous leukemia, Mr. Milken not onlyhelped find the best medical treatment, but over the nextyear constantly visited and called to see how the man wasdoing. According to a letter to Judge Wood written by theman's sister, which was available to Mr. Stewart, Mr. Milkentold the employee to &quot;just get well and I'll take care of anyfinancial responsibilities.&quot; When the man was released fromthe hospital and visited Drexel, &quot;Mike saw {him and} he ranto him {and} hugged him and wept over him,&quot; according to theletter.   Mr. Stewart could have interviewed the writer of thisletter as well as the more than 400 other testaments providedby people who were first-hand witnesses to Mr. Milken'scharacter. Nor did he, it would appear, check the publicrecord to find that Mr. Milken quietly endowed, with $60million, a medical foundation with emphasis on cancerresearch.   Now, one has to ask, how is it that Mr. Stewart's account,in an attempt to tell the history of Mr. Milken and hisworld, has managed to turn day into night and night into day?Mr. Stewart provides the answer in the introduction to hisarticle, when he explains why he chose to believe Mr. Boesky,an admitted perjurer, rather than the numerous documents andwitnesses that contradict Mr. Boesky's account. Mr. Stewartsays that it was the terms of Mr. Boesky's plea bargain thatmake him credible. &quot;Mr. Boesky's only obligation was to tellthe truth; indeed, his plea bargain would be revoked if helied.&quot;   Mr. Stewart misunderstands the incentives facing Mr.Boesky and the other witnesses. He fails to recognize theready availability of people who were willing not just tosing, but to compose in order to win leniency for their ownoffenses. Those who cooperated were treated well. Mr. Boeskyand his family got to keep a large part of his fortune. Mr.Boesky's testimony at the trial of John Mulheren, where hesaid he could not even remember how many lies he had told,was such a flop that the Court of Appeals reversed Mr.Mulheren's conviction with the observation that he had noteven committed a crime. It is no wonder that the governmentdeclined to use Mr. Boesky as a witness at Mr. Milken'ssentencing hearing.   Conversely, Mr. Stewart claims that Mr. Milken has noincentive under his plea agreement to tell the truth. Hewrites, &quot;Mr. Milken's plea bargain isn't revocable even if henow lies.&quot; Mr. Stewart's representation is 100% false. As theplea agreement provides, and as the prosecutor said in opencourt: &quot;If he {Milken} is not fully truthful and accuratewith us, we can prosecute him for additional crimes.&quot;   Mr. Boesky has probably ended his failed career as awitness, but his career as a journalistic source is,apparently, just beginning. Cooperation with journalists,while it doesn't keep one out of prison, does at least makeone look better.   Virtually every witness against Mr. Milken had too much tolose by telling the truth and too much to gain by&quot;cooperating.&quot; The difference is that when a witnesstestifies for the government in court, his testimony istested, by cross-examination, against hard evidence.Journalists are freer to accept fantasy as fact, and to allowsuch witnesses to run rampant. These are the people whoprovided the information for Mr. Stewart's account, and thisexplains why that account does not hold up under scrutiny.   As is clear from Mr. Stewart's centerpiece illustration ofthe Diamond Shamrock/Oxy deal, by inverting the facts one cancreate sinister characterizations for legitimatetransactions, a technique widely used throughout Mr.Stewart's article. The witnesses who cooperated in alteringthe truth have proved useful only for the revisionist historythat inevitably was to follow the events -- a history thatMr. Stewart has written, but that no one who has seen thehard documentary evidence can credit.
