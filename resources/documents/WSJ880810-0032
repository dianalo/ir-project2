Before passage on a voice vote, several relatively minor changes were made in the bill that was cleared last week by the panel's finance subcommittee.    Most significantly, the committee voted to limit the liability of a brokerage firm for trading by &quot;tipees&quot; -- people who receive inside information from an employee of a firm. The change had been urged by lobbyists for the securities industry. As amended, the bill would hold a firm liable for the trading done by the person directly tipped off, but not for the trading by &quot;an endless chain of tipees,&quot; said Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the finance subcommittee.    The committee also deleted from the subcommittee's version a section that attempted to codify the rights of redress for people -- other than those who were on the other side of an insider trader's transactions -- who are injured by insider trading. The section was intended to address, for example, the injury to a bidder for a company caused by an insider trader whose trading forces up the price of the target company. A panel aide said lawmakers decided this evolving area of the law should be left to the courts.    The full House may vote on the bill next month, but the bill faces a less certain future on the Senate side, where the Banking Committee lately has focused on the problems of the thrift industry and on revising the law that separates commercial banking from investment banking. </TEXT></DOC>
