Theerosion zones with quicksand and weak sedimentary rocks are associatedwith particular hazards. Anomalies of gravity force in the zones situatedabove and below an erosion zone are analyzed. Distribution of microanomalyof gravity force and its tower vertical gradient below an erosion zoneis evaluated. A method for evaluating results of gravity surveys usedfor determining the boundary line between Carboniferous and overlyingstrata is evaluated. Examples of its use in the Upper Silesia basin aredescribed. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
