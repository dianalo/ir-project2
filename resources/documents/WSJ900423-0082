Rundle   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/23/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B8B</SO><CO>   MDBK</CO><IN>DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)</IN><LP>   Professional Bancorp Inc. expects first-quarter net incomeof about $100,000, or 10 cents a share, compared with$267,000, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier, said Joel W.Kovner, chairman and chief executive officer of the SantaMonica, Calif., company.   Mr. Kovner blamed the more than 60% drop on asignificantly higher tax rate, a lower prime rate and anincrease in the bank holding company's Federal DepositInsurance Corp. assessment. Professional Bancorp's number ofshares outstanding rose to 965,000 after a 25% stock dividendthat took effect last month.</LP><TEXT>   For the full year, Mr. Kovner predicts that the companywill earn roughly $800,000, or 82 cents a share, assumingthat the prime rate remains at the current rate of 10%.Professional Bancorp posted 1989 net income of about $1million, or $1.13 a share.   Professional Bancorp's only subsidiary, First ProfessionalBank, has four offices in California whose customers aremainly physicians. &quot;We're basically a medical bank,&quot; Mr.Kovner said. &quot;Clients have our officers' home phone numbersand can call day or night.&quot;   Couriers are dispatched to pick up deposits fromphysicians' offices at no charge. To arrange a loan, a bankofficer will go to the physician's office. &quot;We've assisted inbuying hospitals and locating land because we know themedical market,&quot; Mr. Kovner said.   Mr. Kovner said the company's tax rate in the firstquarter was about 42.5%, compared with 11% a year earlierwhen the company paid only state taxes and no federal taxes.&quot;We've run out of tax credits and any type of net operatinglosses,&quot; Mr. Kovner said. The 42.5% rate is anticipated forthe full year.   The prime rate is down about 150 basis points from theyear-earlier quarter, Mr. Kovner said. A basis point is1/100th of a percentage point. &quot;Each 50 basis points is worthabout $300,000 to us in {annual} earnings, or $75,000 aquarter.&quot; The company's FDIC assessment has increased by$15,000 a quarter, Mr. Kovner said.   Despite the anticipated net income decline, the companycontinues to grow. At the end of last month, assets stood atabout $128 million, up 16% from $110 million at the end ofthe 1989 first quarter. Deposits grew 17.5% to $120 millionfrom $102 million.   Professional Bancorp expects to open a new bank officenear Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif., laterthis year. Also planned this year or early next year is oneor two new California offices in Loma Linda and/or thePomona-Ontario area. Within the next few years, the companymay also establish offices in Long Beach, Calif., Sacramentoand Boston or New York, Mr. Kovner said.   &quot;Our planned growth might include a public offering in thenext year or so if capital markets are appropriate,&quot; Mr.Kovner said. In February, the company eliminated all itslong-term debt and has no short-term debt. &quot;I think debt isbad unless absolutely necessary. This bank is veryconservatively run on a financial basis and it would befoolish to bring on debt.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
