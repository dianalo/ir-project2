It is concludedthat photogeologic mapping shows the presence of a wide range of materialson Mars. Many of which appear to be volcanic. The knowledge of the compositionof these materials is poorly constrained. Inferences drawn from the morphologyof individual flows would suggest that most of the materials had rheologicalproperties similar to basalt or other mafic magmas.</TEXT></DOC>
