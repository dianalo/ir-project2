(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   His name is not as familiar as chiefexecutive F. Ross Johnson or buyout specialist Henry Kravis, but asthe key decisionmaker in history's largest corporate takeover,Charles E. Hugel held the fate of both dealmakers in his hands.   The 60-year-old Hugel is chairman and chief executive officer ofhis own $3 billion company, Combustion Engineering Inc. of Stamford.But he also serves as non-executive chairman of the board of RJRNabisco Inc. and head of RJR's five-member special directors'committee.   In the latter role, he was responsible for choosing a winner inthe nation's biggest and wildest corporate bidding war, whichproduced an apparent triumph for Kravis and his buyout firm,Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. late Wednesday.   Kravis's much-revised bid of $24.53 billion for RJR Nabisco waschosen over a competing offer from a Johnson-led management group.   In the eye of the hurricane whipped up by the bidding stood theunassuming Hugel, who is described by those who know him as aninnovative businessman who quietly tackles goals that some will onlytalk about.   For instance, he was one of the first American businessmen tonegotiate a major deal with the Soviet Union.   In June, Combustion Engineering announced it had reached anagreement to help build and manage a multibillion-dollarpetrochemical complex in two Western Siberian cities. It was thecompany's second deal with the Soviet Union in six months.   Hugel also has previous experience in the merger and acquisitionwars as a director of Primerica Corp., a Greenwich, Conn.-basedfinancial services giant sold earlier this year to Commercial CreditCorp. in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $1.65 billion.   A former executive vice president of American Telephone andTelegraph Co. and former president of Ohio Bell Telephone Co., Hugelwas regarded as neutral in the Nabisco battle because he is``non-executive chairman,'' which means he is not an employee of thecompany.   When he took the Nabisco post, he became the only Fortune 500company chairman also serving as chief executive officer andchairman of another major firm.   The role of his special committee was critical to the future ofthe Atlanta-based food and tobacco conglomerate. The committee wascriticized by some on Wall Street for adding to the confusion of thebidding process by extending the deadline for bids to Nov. 29. Andeven then, the deadline proved meaningless, since both principalbidders upped their offers well after the time limit.   But for Hugel and the committee it was a finely calculated risk.By extending the bidding, Hugel hoped to maximize the offers for thecompany _ and the return to shareholders.   While deadlines were abused, the extensions may have spared thecompany some future litigation from shareholders complaining theydidn't get the best deal possible.   Still, the one goal that eluded Hugel was orderliness. Theauction was confused and rife with personality clashes to the end.   And in a final, cruel twist of fate, Hugel and the committeedecided to spurn their own management team, led by Johnson, in favorof the outside buyout specialists.   Raised by a single mother during the Depression, Hugel served astint in the Army and started at ATandamp;T as a student engineer. He saidteamwork is a key part of his management philosophy.   ``I worked at ATandamp;T for 30 years and at ATandamp;T, you learn how todelegate to good people and how to build teamwork,'' he said in arecent interview.   A business associate said he is sure Hugel's experience was anasset at the negotiating table while the RJR deal was being workedout.   ``He is a very practical businessman and a hard worker,'' saidPrimerica Chairman Gerald Tsai Jr. ``If he has a goal he gets it.... Charlie was the first in America with this size contract withthe Soviet Union. He was very persistent and he finally got it.''   Hugel is ``straightforward,'' Tsai said. ``If he says something,you can bank on it.''   Several Wall Street analysts declined to talk about Hugel duringthe RJR negotiations. One, who spoke on condition of anonymity, wascritical of Hugel's management of Combustion Engineering.   ``He's running CE into the ground,'' the analyst said. ``Thecosts are out of sight. He's getting his comeuppance.   ``I think he ought to stay in CE more,'' he said. ``It's toughenough to run one company well. ... He's spending his time handlingNabisco.''   Combustion Engineering _ which builds and servicespower-generating systems for utilities, supplies equipment tochemical and refining industries and operates waste-to-energy plants_ recently announced a loss of $62.9 million in its revisednine-month results.   The company said the results were due to increases in estimatedcosts to complete its waste-to-energy plants, cost overruns andrepair costs.   Despite those problems, some analysts predict improvement in thecompany's fortunes next year. Combustion Engineering is in theprocess of selling off $285 million in assets and will be able touse the cash to reduce its debt and interest expenses.   With low demand for new power plants, Hugel has steered thecompany in the direction of maintenance and service, where revenuesare expected to grow.   Hugel has been upbeat about his business decisions in the past.In the 1987 annual report, he told Combustion Engineeringshareholders that the company had ``made considerable progress''toward becoming a ``new and different'' company.   Hugel is also a member of the boards of directors of Eaton Corp.and Pitney Bowes Inc. and chairman of the board of trustees ofLafayette College, his alma mater.</TEXT></DOC>
