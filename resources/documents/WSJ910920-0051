The proposal by the National Organization of Life andHealth Insurance Guaranty Associations also could reduce thecost to the industry-backed funds, which pay offpolicyholders when an insurer fails. Executive Life, whichwas taken over by California regulators in April, is thenation's second-largest insurance failure after MutualBenefit Life Insurance Co., Newark, N.J., which was takenover in July.</LP><TEXT>   California state regulators have estimated that guarantyfunds may have to pay as much as $1 billion in benefits toExecutive Life policyholders, even if the company is acquiredby another insurer. While the outlook is uncertain, theguaranty funds group hopes that &quot;several hundred milliondollars&quot; might be saved if the group takes over and runsExecutive Life itself, Eden D. Sarfaty, president of thegroup, said in an interview.   At a meeting earlier this week, state regulators were toldprivately that, by judicious management of Executive Life'sinvestment portfolio, the guaranty funds group might not haveto pay any money for as long as five years, greatly easingpotential assessments on the life insurance industry tosupport the guaranty funds.   The associations' plan will be filed in a court-monitoredauction that is slated to close Oct. 11. To date, the onlybidder for Executive Life is a French investor group thatincludes Altus Finance, a 60%-owned unit of the French bankCredit Lyonnais. The Altus group has offered to acquireExecutive Life for $3 billion, although most of that moneywould go toward removing the junk-bond portfolio from thecompany's insurance operations.   The guaranty-fund proposal isn't yet a formal bid andhasn't been approved by all of the organization's members.Nonetheless, it suggests a ground-breaking approach to largeinsurance insolvencies.   Other potential bids for Executive Life may be waiting inthe wings, including one organized by San Franciscoinvestment bankers Hellman andamp; Friedman and Chicago investorSamuel Zell. A spokesman for Hellman andamp; Friedman wouldn'tcomment.   The guaranty associations' plan would provide 100% ofdeath benefits, annuity payments and account values topolicyholders covered by life insurance guaranty funds.Claims outside the guaranty fund limits would initially becredited with about 85% of their face value and have &quot;arealistic potential&quot; of receiving 100% of contract valueswithin five years, the guaranty associations said.   As well, the new plan would give some policyholders theright to withdraw as much as 10% of policy values each yearwithout penalty.   The associations' plan would retain all of ExecutiveLife's assets and liabilities, putting them into a newcompany called Galico and manage them to maturity.   By contrast, the French proposal takes a different tack,calling for the immediate sale of most of Executive Life'sjunk-bond portfolio to Altus Finance for $2.7 billion, or alittle over half of the bonds' book value. A new companywould then continue -- free of junk bonds -- with existingpolicies and plans to sell new ones. Some $300 million of newcapital would be injected by a group of French investors leadby Mutuelle Assurance Artisanale de France, an insuranceconcern.   Mr. Sarfaty, of the National Organization of Life andHealth Insurance Guaranty Associations, said theassociations' plan would offer a higher return to claimantsbecause the guaranty associations seek to reduce theirliabilities rather than to make a profit.   The nation's life insurance guaranty system is an amalgamof 47 separate state associations, who are voluntary membersof the national organization. Mr. Sarfaty said that while keymembers of the association have agreed to the plan, othersmust sign on before a formal bid could be tendered.   Regulators praised the guaranty proposal but cautionedthat it must match benefits legally owed policyholders understate laws. &quot;We have to be assured that policyholders coveredby the funds come out whole in this,&quot; said James Long,president of the National Association of InsuranceCommissioners and North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance.   Individual state guaranty associations' coverages vary butgenerally include as much as $100,000 cash value of policiesand annuities and as much as $300,000 of death benefits.Those differences are troubling regulators and efforts arebeing made to standardize guaranty provisions across thecountry.   The guaranty associations' proposal will add fire to agrowing debate over the merits of the French group's bid,which would credit policyholders initially with 81 cents onthe dollar. Thereafter, guaranty funds and other revenueswould total 100 cents on the dollar for policyholders coveredby guaranty funds.   The investors' group yesterday, in a statement, questionedthe wisdom of retaining Executive Life's big junk-bondportfolio, as the guaranty associations would do. Theassociations argued that, in exchange for taking some addedrisk, they can recoup profits that otherwise would accrue toAltus Finance, the buyer of the junk-bond portfolio under theFrench plan, and to French investors who would run theinsurance operation.   &quot;Obviously this plan entails some risks for the guarantyassociations,&quot; said Mr. Sarfaty, but he added that bothpolicyholders and guaranty funds may benefit.   Los Angeles-based Executive Life is the principal unit ofFirst Executive Corp., which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcyproceedings. The other major unit, Executive Life InsuranceCo. of New York, is under the control of regulators in thatstate and isn't directly affected by the Californiasituation.</TEXT></DOC>
