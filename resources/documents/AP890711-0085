Michel Aoun would use air strikes against Syriangunboats blockading Christian ports.   Police said the aging Hawker Hunter flew at a very low altitudeover west Beirut's waterfront, where the Syrians maintain howitzerbatteries that have been shelling the Christian coastline for morethan four months.   ``It came very low over the sea from the north, flew low over theboulevard and then turned west and north again,'' said aneyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standingrules, said Syrian gunners manning dozens of multi-barreledanti-aircraft guns in west Beirut did not open up on the jet fighter.   ``It seems their radars did not detect the Hawker Hunter becauseit flew very low,'' the spokesman said.   A source at Aoun's air force, speaking on condition of anonymity,described the midday overflight as a drill. He would not say more.   The flight was the first by one of Aoun's three operationalHawker Hunters since the outbreak of the confrontation with theSyrians and allied forces in March.   Aides to Aoun said Monday the 54-year-old Maronite general wasplanning air strikes against Syrian gunboats blockading thecoastline of the 310-square-mile Christian region north of Beirut toblock Iraqi-supplied war materiel.   In addition to the British-made Hawker Hunters, Aoun has eightFrench-designed Gazelle helicopter gunships.   Aoun's aides say the Syrians have six gunboats patrolling theChristian-controlled 28-mile stretch of Lebanon's 130-mileMediterranean coast.   On Monday, Syrian shelling sank a Greek-owned oil tanker thatunloaded its cargo at a Christian port. Syrian gunboats this weekintercepted at least three cargo ships carrying food supplies and afuel tanker headed for the Christian enclave.   The independent daily paper An-Nahar said internationalreinsurance companies have doubled the premium for ships sailing toLebanon because of the new risks involved.   Arab League efforts to halt the 17-week confrontation appear tobe making little headway. By police count, the latest round ofviolence has killed 405 people and wounded 1,581 people.   Aoun, addressing a news conference Monday, said he rejected aSyrian demand that ships heading for the Christian enclave besearched by Arab observers for weapons.   Asked whether his forces did receive Soviet-designed Frog-7missiles from Iraq, Aoun said: ``I'm not going to say yes or no. Letthe Syrians find out the hard way.''   The Syrians, who have an estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon undera 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, tightened their blockadeafter demanding removal of the missiles, which are capable ofstriking Damascus.   The Beirut daily paper Ash-Sharq, which is close to Syria, quotedunidentified ``foreign intelligence officials'' as saying Iranpledged to provide Lebanese Moslem and leftist factions withmissiles to match Aoun's Frog-7s.   The latest round of violence broke out March 8 after Aoun imposeda blockade on Moslem-run ports that he said were depriving hisgovernment of $100 million a year in tax revenue.   The Syrians, who back a rival Moslem government, retaliated bybesieging the Christian enclave, and Aoun pledged to drive theSyrians out of the country.</TEXT></DOC>
