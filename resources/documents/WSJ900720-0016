Until this week, the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries midyear conference, to begin Thursday in Geneva,had been expected to be short and tension-free. The 13 oilministers had been expected to rubber-stamp a July 10proposal by five Persian Gulf producers, including Iraq, thatthe two main quota cheaters in their ranks cut output, giventhe promise of higher allotments later.</LP><TEXT>   The overproducers are Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,and, according to monitors of OPEC production, both arealready trimming their output. Still, President SaddamHussein of Iraq, who has been bitterly accusing the twocountries of overproduction for several months, threatenedthis week to use force against them unless they mended theirways.   By yesterday, President Hussein's escalating campaignagainst his chief target, Kuwait, had triggered a flurry ofcharges and countercharges between Baghdad and Kuwait City,centering on their long-running border dispute.   Kuwait officially sought the support of its Arabneighbors, while Iraq's parliament took steps to name SaddamHussein president for life. And OPEC watchers conceded thatthe outlook for next week's meeting now is less than clear.   But what is clear, oil specialists said, is that throughhis latest hardball tactics, President Hussein is reshapingalliances and expanding his influence in OPEC, a longstandinggoal, and that this signals higher world oil prices ahead.   &quot;This is the most important development for the oilindustry since the 1979 Iranian revolution,&quot; Bryan Jacoboski,senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said. &quot;Iraq has takenOPEC's political leadership away from Kuwait, which had takenit from Saudi Arabia, and the impact will be felt well beyondnext week's meeting.&quot;   Kuwait essentially had stood alone in OPEC in recentmonths -- if not recent years -- in stubbornly holding to itsposition that low oil prices were the only way that thePersian Gulf producers holding the bulk of the world's oilreserves could assure markets of their petroleum in thedecades ahead. Saudi Arabia's oil authorities still may holdsimilar views, but their public posture in recent months hasbeen to support higher oil prices. It was Saudi Arabia thathosted the early-July meeting of the five Persian Gulf oilministers and then announced the plan to push up the OPECbenchmark price from this year's low of $14 a barrel to atleast $18.   Iraq has oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia's. Butthe eight-year war with Iran delayed Iraq's plans to build upits oil-producing capacity beyond the prewar peak of 3.5million barrels a day. Expansion goals still are sidetracked,because of the lack of capital and the pressing need torebuild the war-damaged economy. So Iraq, which has longwanted higher oil prices, has been blaming Kuwait and the UAEfor engaging in &quot;economic warfare,&quot; by causing the world oilglut, depressing oil prices and costing Iraq about $14billion in lost revenue this year.   Ironically, in his search for higher oil prices, PresidentHussein has drawn a staunch new ally, his old war foe Iran.Some months ago, the oil ministers of Iraq and Irandiscovered that they shared a common pricing goal. Now,though they may differ on other matters, the threepowerhouses of the Persian Gulf -- Iraq, Iran and SaudiArabia -- are linked in a push for higher oil prices.   But President Hussein is forging a bigger coalition thanthat in OPEC. Except for the handful of remaining PersianGulf producers, almost every member of OPEC wants higher oilprices. Many of these countries, such as Indonesia, alreadyare producing at capacity. The only way they can increaserevenue is through higher petroleum prices.   Iraq and Iran recently agreed to support jointly aneventual increase in the OPEC pricing target to $25 a barrelfrom $18. Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, returnedhome after visiting the UAE, Algeria and Libya in his pushfor higher prices. He told reporters in Tehran he expects theGeneva talks to focus on ways to lift the OPEC benchmark to$20.   By any measure, the Iraq-Iran-Saudi trio already hassucceeded in getting oil prices higher. The OPEC benchmark,which is based on a basket of seven crudes, is up at least $2a barrel from the year's low to $16. In the U.S., where oilprices traditionally are higher than the OPEC average, crudeoil futures rose again yesterday, with the August crude up 44cents to $18.99 a barrel.   Oil specialists generally suggest there is still room forWest Texas Intermediate, or WTI, the U.S. benchmark crude, torise some more, despite the burdensome level of oilinventories. &quot;We expect the price of WTI to slowly advancetoward a maximum of $20 to $22 a barrel in the upcomingwinter season,&quot; reports Stanford Field, an oil consultantwith SRI International of Menlo Park, Calif. Paul Mlotok, anoil economist with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., also believes thatoil prices may have bottomed, and that WTI should be backover $20 a barrel before year end.   It was Mr. Mlotok who coined the phrase &quot;Saddam Factor&quot; toexplain the new realities in OPEC. And Petroleum Politics, anindustry publication, reports that President Hussein's oilstrategy began to take shape as long ago as February, &quot;whenit became obvious that only a concerted drive to force up oilprices would save Iraq from an extended economic crisis.&quot;PaineWebber's Mr. Jacoboski likens the strategy to that ofthe state oil agencies that enforced restraints on U.S. oilproduction to prop up the price for decades. &quot;SaddamHussein,&quot; he says, &quot;is the new Texas Railroad Commission ofOPEC.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
