L. 98-554, 49 U.S.C.2503). Section 204 of the Act defines the term ``commercial motor vehicle''as any self-propelled or towed vehicle used on highways in interstate commerceto transport passengers or property if (a) such vehicle has a gross vehicleweight rating of 10,001 or more pounds; (b) such vehicle is designed totransport more than 15 passengers, including the driver; or (c) such vehicleis used in the transportation of materials found by the Secretary of Transportation(the Secretary) to be hazardous for the purposes of the Hazardous MaterialsTransportation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1801-1812 (1982)) in a quantity requiringplacarding under regulations issued by the Secretary under such Act. Thissection of the Act defines interstate commerce as ``trade, traffic, ortransportation in the United States which is between a place in a stateand a place outside of such state (including a place outside of the UnitedStates) or is between two places in a state through another state or aplace outside of the United States.''The purposes of the Act are to (1) promote the safe operation of commercialmotor vehicles; (2) minimize dangers to the health of operators of commercialmotor vehicles and other employees whose employment directly affects motorcarrier safety; and (3) assure increased compliance with traffic laws andwith the commercial motor vehicle safety and health rules, regulations,standards, and orders issued pursuant to this Act.Under the current FMCSR, for-hire motors carriers of passengers and propertyand private carriers of property are required to meet minimum safety standardsfor the safe operation and maintenance of commercial motor vehicles ininterstate commerce. These standards are enforced by State and local personneland Federal safety investigators nationwide.The Congress found that it is in the public interest to enhance commercialmotor vehicle safety and, thus, help to reduce highway fatalities, injuries,and property damage. By having more uniform commercial motor vehicle controlsand strengthened enforcement, the number of fatalities and injuries aswell as the level of property damage related to commercial motor vehicleoperations would be reduced. During the last 2 years, the FHWA contractedfor a study of private motor carriers of passengers. The FHWA has usedthis study to prepare the draft regulatory evaluation and regulatory flexibilityanalysis which formed the basis for this proposed rule. A copy of FHWA'sevaluation has been placed in the public docket. The evaluation and analysisconcluded that highway safety would be enhanced by regulating operationsof private motor carriers of passengers.Comprehensive accident data pertaining to private motor carriers of passengersis not available. This is primarily due to the fact such carriers werenot subject to the requirements of the FMCSRs, including the accident reportingprovisions. Nevertheless, based on accident statistics from the FHWA, theNational Safety Council, and the National School Transportation Association,compiled by the contractor who performed the study, the FHWA estimatesthat there are approximately 67,500 vehicles in this unregulated classand there would be an accident rate of 1.33 accidents per million vehiclemiles traveled (VMT) for private motor carriers of passengers. Further,the contractor estimated that each such vehicle would, on average, travel10,000 miles per year in interestate and intrastate commerece. These estimatestranslate into approximately 891 accidents, on average, each year for thiscurrently unregulated class.A search was also made of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)in-depth accident studies. Recently, the NTSB studied three accidents involvingprivate motor carriers of passengers operating in interstate commerce.\1\<NOTE/> These three accidents involved 14 deaths and 87 persons injured.In one accident, both driver error and mechanical defects were cited aspossible causes of the accident. The other two accidents both involvedtire failures; one due to a blowout, the other to poor traction capability.In addition, the NTSB is currently investigating a multiple-fatality accidentthat occurred in Carrollton, Kentucky, on May 14, 1988. This accident involveda private carriage of passengers in which there were 27 fatalities and34 injuries.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ National Transportation Safety Board, Highway AccidentReport, Nos. NTSB-HAR-81-4, NTSB-HAR-84-06, NTSB-HAR-85-01, Washington,DC 20594. Copies of the report are available for review in the public docket.Of the accidents in the sample collected by the contractor 54 percent wereattributable in whole or in part to driver error or incapacity of somevariety, 4 percent were attributable to driver fatigue and 4 percent toimproper towing. Together, for this sample, the driver-associated accidentsaccounted for 63 fatalities and 238 injuries. From this data, it can beconcluded that additional safety measures directed at drivers, drivingthe motor vehicle, and general operational safety precautions are warranted.The FHWA also contacted several of the larger States to gather furtheraccident data on intrastate private motor carriers of passengers. Amongtheir intrastate motor vehicle passenger accidents, the States contactedwere unable to distinguish commercial from general motor vehicles involvedin accidents. Comments are requested from States and others which can submitaccident data on intrastate private motor carriage of passengers.The FHWA's accident data in 1983 (the most recent accident data reportavailable) for interstate for-hire motor carriers of passengers (whichthe FHWA currently regulates) shows that this group has an accident rateof 0.50 accidents per million VMT. The fatality and injury rates are 0.0659and 0.82 per million VMT, respectively. The MC-50B accident reports filedby these carriers cover ``regular'' and ``charter'' operations for-hireof motor carriers of passengers.The FHWA believes that private carriers of passengers, having been unregulatedat the Federal level as a class, would be less apt to be in conformitywith safety standards as stringent as those that apply to for-hire motorcarrier of passengers. Since the States' regulations of motor carriersare similar to the Federal regulations, most States have excluded privatemotor carriers from their safety regulations. This means that there isoften no means to ensure that these vehicles are safely operated and maintained.Motor carriers that are covered by our regulations are subject to roadsidesafety inspections by State enforcement personnel (in 1988, 1.5 millioninspections were conducted nationwide), reviews and ratings of their safetyprocedures by Federal safety investigators, and accident reporting requirementsto identify problem carriers.The FHWA believes there exists an opportunity to improve the safety operationsof private motor carriers of passengers. The imposition of safety standardson private carriers of passengers should reduce highway fatalities, injuries,and property damage, as well as reduce the potential for such accidents.The FHWA recognizes that this group of motor carriers consists of a widevariety of entities. The FHWA, therefore, is proposing that private motorcarriers of passengers be classified into two distinct classes. The distinguishingfactor among the classes is the relationship of the driver of the vehicleto the motor carrier in each class.Information which provides a rationale for a particular position on a questionis very important, as is data which estimates the cost impacts and benefitsof the action under consideration. The FHWA is seeking data, information,and answers to adequately consider the merits of how the regulation ofprivate carriage would affect each interested party's position.The Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 (1986 Act) (Title XII,Pub. L. 99-570) was passed by Congress and signed by the President on October27, 1986. It is designed to remove unsafe and unqualified drivers fromour Nation's highways and to ensure that all drivers possess the knowledgeand skills necessary to safely operate the types of vehicles they drive.The Act is very broad in scope and has defined the term ``commerce'' tomean_<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) trade, traffic, and transportation within the jurisdiction ofthe United States between a place in a State and a place outside of suchState (including a place outside the United States); and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) trade traffic, and transportation in the United States which affectsany trade, traffic, and transportation described in subparagraph (A). (49U.S.C. App. 2716)</ITAG>Additionally, the 1986 Act defines ``commercial motor vehicle'' as a motorvehicle used in commerce to transport <T3>passengers </T3>or property.<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) if the vehicle has a gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 ormore pounds or such a lesser gross vehicle weight rating as the Secretarydetermines appropriate by regulation but not less than a gross vehicleweight rating of 10,001 pounds;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) if the vehicle is designed to transport more than 15 passengers,including the driver; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) if such vehicle is used in the transportation of materials foundby the Secretary to be hazardous for the purposes of the Hazardous MaterialsTransportation Act.</ITAG>The FHWA has already indicated that the 1986 Act applies to private motorcarriers of passengers. In the final rule implementing the commercial driverlicense standards; requirements and penalties, the FHWA stated: ``Congressclearly intended the Act to apply to the broadest set of employers involvedin trade, traffic, and transportation in all sectors of the economy. Theonly persons who may be excluded from the Act are those operators who usea motor vehicle, which otherwise meets the commercial motor vehicle definition,strictly and exclusively to transport personal possessions or family membersfor nonbusiness purposes.'' (52 FR 20579).The 1986 Act requires that the drivers of vehicles designed to transportmore than 15 passengers (including the driver): (1) Have a single driver'slicense with a single driver's record; (2) notify his/her employer andState of licensure issuance of certain moving traffic violations and fora commercial motor vehicle driving history; (3) be disqualified from drivingsuch a vehicle if the driver commits certain criminal or traffic violations;and (4) pass a knowledge test and a skills test based on the type of vehiclethey will be licensed to drive. The single license requirement, the notificationrequirements, and the disqualification provisions became effective July1, 1987. The FHWA issued the minimum testing standards on July 15, 1988(53 FR 27628, Docket MC 87-18). All drivers including drivers of commercialmotor vehicles operated by private carriers of passengers must obtain anew or renewed State driver's license based on these standards by April1992.The FHWA does not intend that the proposed Private Carriage of Passengersregulations affect Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program funding forany State that selects to exempt the intrastate operations of these affectedgroups from the proposed requirements contained within.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>The FHWA received six comments on the matter of regulating private carriageof passengers under the FMCSRs in response to a 1985 ANPRM in <T4>Federal Register </T4>(50 FR 2998, Docket No. MC-114). Three commentswere from representatives of State law enforcement agencies, two were fromrepresentatives of State Departments of Transportation, and one commentwas received from the United Bus Owners of America (UBOA).The UBOA advocates that private motor carriers of passengers and theirdrivers be subject to the FMCSRs in its entirety. The Commissioner of Safetyfor the State of New Hampshire wrote in support of regulating all privatemotor carriers of passengers and their drivers. However, he suggested thatthe minimum age requirement (21 years for interstate commerce drivers)and the medical certificate requirement not be mandated for drivers oftwo-axle private motor vehicles of passengers.Maine's State Police Traffic Division stated that all of the FMCSRs shouldapply to private motor carriers of passengers and their drivers exceptfor the insurance requirements (49 CFR Part 387). It suggested a phase-inof those FMCSRs standards which require written documentation. The DOTfor the State of Wisconsin advocated that private motor carriers of passengersand their drivers be subject to certain parts of the FMCSRs. These arethe Qualifications of Drivers, 49 CFR Part 391; Parts and Accessories Necessaryfor Safe Operation, 49 CFR Part 393; and Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance,49 CFR Part 396. The Maryland State Police Department advocated the phase-inof the application of the FMCSRs to private motor carriers of passengersand their drivers. It suggested eliminating the hours of service (49 CFRPart 395) paperwork requirement but retaining the paperwork requirementfor inspection, repair and maintenance (49 CFR Part 396).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>A private motor carrier of passengers is a person who is engaged in anenterprise other than motor vehicle transportation, and who provides transportationof passengers, by motor vehicle, that is within the scope of, and in thefurtherance of that enterprise. In addition, to be covered by the proposedrule, a motor vehicle used to transport passengers must be designed totransport more than 15 passengers, including the driver, and be used ininterstate commerce.Examples of some private motor carriers of passengers involved in interstatetransportation operations are: (1) Boy Scout and Girl Scout organizationsbus transportation across State boundaries, (2) private church bus transportationor church members across State boundaries, (3) a business transportingits workers in a bus from one manufacturing plant in one State to anothermanufacturing plant in another State, and (4) travel clubs using theirown or leased buses on an interstate trip.The FHWA recognizes that some of these entities are not engaged in anybusiness enterprise. Many are nonprofit or not-for-profit organizationsor volunteer groups who travel as an organization using a vehicle and/ordriver affiliated with the organization. This operation is quite differentfrom that which the general public considers, and the FHWA has historicallyregulated, as a motor carrier.In this proposed rule the FHWA recognizes not only the difference amongthe operations that can be defined as private carriers of passengers butalso the differences between this group and the currently regulated, for-hirecarriers of passengers. The intent of this proposed rule is to apply theFMCSRs as uniformly as possible to all similar operations and minimizeunnecessary regulatory and paperwork burdens.Because of this diversity and divergence from the population group currentlyregulated by the FMCSRs, the FHWA proposes to classify the population intotwo distinct groups:I. <T3>Private motor carriers of passengers with employees hired as drivers.</T3>This group is defined as those carriers that have purchased or haveleased vehicles and hired a person or persons specifically to drive thesevehicles. Company buses used to shuttle employees between manufacturingplants and privately-owned buses used to transport professional sportsteams or performers between States are two examples of private motor carriersof passengers with employees hired as drivers.For the purpose of this proposed rulemaking, ``hired'' means to be involvedin an activity or work in which compensation is paid for services rendered.II. <T3>Limited private motor carriers of passengers. </T3>This group containscarriers that transport their employees or members interstate in theirown or leased vehicles driven by a person who is a volunteer or employedby the carrier in another capacity and who receives little or no remunerationfor the driving. Church groups in which the minister, or another employeeof the group drives the church-owned vehicle or a school teacher drivingthe school's football team, are two examples. A Boy Scout troop in whichone of the parents drives a troop-owned vehicle or a church group in whichone of the members of the congregation drives the vehicle and receivesno remuneration are also examples of this group.The relationship of the driver to the motor carrier was chosen by the FHWAas the most equitable factor in defining private carriers of motor carrierssince this relationship best appropriates the employment relationship ofdrivers and regulated for-hire carriers. It also provides a parallel withthe exemptions currently included in the FMCSRs regarding intermittent,casual, or occasional drivers (49 CFR 391.63). Comments are requested onthe proposal to differentiate entities within the broad definition of privatecarriers of passengers and on the factor (driver/motor carrier relationship)used by the FHWA to make this differentiation. The FHWA is also interestedin receiving comments on the applicability of these definitions to allpossible types of private carriers of passengers. Is there some entitythat would not fit into one of these groups?There has been some confusion in the past whether drivers of recreationalvehicles are subject to the FMCSRs and/or the CDL requirements. Such driversare not subject to these requirements when the vehicle is being used forpersonal purposes, such as a family vacation. Commercial motor vehicles operated by agencies of the Federal or the variousState and/or local governments have been exempted from the safety regulationsexcept for reporting interstate accidents as required by 49 CFR 394 (See53 FR 18042, dated May 19, 1988). The FHWA proposes to continue the exemptionfor Federal, State, and local governments. Comments are requested on thisproposal as well as on what additional steps the FHWA might take to fostercompliance with the regulations by governments. Again it should be emphasizedthat the interstate movements of these groups are the ones covered by thisproposal.The FMCSRs are contained in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts390 through 399 and Part 382 and can be divided into seven main areas:(1) Driver qualifications (Part 391)_age; employment applications; driverqualification files; skill and knowledge qualifications; and physical qualifications;(2) Operation of the vehicle (Part 392)_general vehicle safety, equipment,inspection, and use; prohibition against the use of drugs and other substances;(3) Parts and accessories necessary for safe operation (Part 393)_lights,brakes, windows, fuel systems, tires, etc;(4) Accident reporting (Part 394)_reports that must be made to FHWA; recordkeepingrequirements;(5) hours of service (Part 395)_driving and on duty time limitations; recordof duty status preparation and exemptions;(6) Vehicle inspection and maintenance (Part 396)_recordkeeping of maintenanceprocedures; pre-and-post trip inspections;(7) Commercial Drivers License (Part 383)_a valid, single license to operatea class of commercial motor vehicle.Part 390 includes general definitions, and Parts 397, 398, and 399 applyonly to hazardous materials carriers, transportation of migrant workers,and employee health and safety, respectively.The full text of the FMCSRs is available from the Government Printing Office(GPO) as well as from many motor carrier industry trade associations andpublishing firms. Those persons wishing to obtain a copy of the FMCSRsfrom the GPO may contact the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. GovernmentPrinting Office, Washington, DC, 20402, telephone (202) 275-3648. A copyof the FMCSRs is available for review in the FHWA docket room (see sectiontitled, ADDRESS).<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Requirements</ITAG>The FHWA is proposing to apply the FMCSRs to the two groups of privatecarriers of passengers in varying degrees and to phase in the requirements.The proposed driver qualification and driver hours of service requirementsare discussed separately for each group. The FHWA believes that vehicleand operational requirements should be identical for both groups and consistentwith the requirements for other regulated entities. The FHWA is also proposingthat the paperwork/documentation requirements for driver qualificationsand hours of service vary, for the groups.As previously mentioned, the requirements of the Act regarding commercialdriver's license (CDL) are to be applicable to all drivers who operatea commercial motor vehicle that is designed to transport more than 15 passengers,including drivers in both interstate and intrastate operations, includingdrivers for private carriers of passengers. Therefore, drivers in bothgroups are subject to the CDL requirements which are contained in 49 CFRPart 383.Private Motor Carriers with Employees Hired as Drivers (Group I)The FHWA believes this class of operations most closely resembles the for-hireoperations. Persons are specifically hired to drive a vehicle on a regularbasis either over a fixed route or to a variety of destinations for morethan 10 percent of that employee's time. For this reason, the FHWA is proposingthat the FMCSRs would apply in their entirety to this group with a one-timewaiver, as described below, for currently employed drivers and equipment.The requirements regarding background and character of drivers (applicationfor employment (49 CFR 392.21), investigation and inquiries (49 CFR 391.23),notifications of previous employment (49 CFR 383.35), and examinationsand tests (road test (49 CFR 391.31 and 49 CFR 392.33)) and written test(49 CFR 391.35 and 49 CFR 391.37)) would not apply to those drivers regularlyemployed by a motor carrier on the date this rule becomes final as longas the person continues to be regularly employed as a driver for that motorcarrier. The purposes of these requirements are to ascertain a driversemployment, experience, and driving record. This would not be necessaryfor drivers already employed by a private carrier of passengers. Such awaiver is consistent with prior regulation of driver groups for the firsttime.Members of this group would be defined as motor carriers for the purposesof receiving safety fitness ratings issued by the FHWA included under to49 CFR Part 395. Section 215 of the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 directsthe Secretary of Transportation, in cooperation with the Interstate CommerceCommission, to establish a procedure to determine the safety fitness ofowners and operators of commercial motor vehicles, including persons seekingnew or additional motor carrier operating authority. This is an establishedprocedure described under 49 CFR Part 385 which involves an on-site visitby a Federal safety investigator to review a motor carrier's safety proceduresand practices. The FHWA would appreciate specific comments regarding possibleenforcement concerns of Group I private motor carriers of passengers, especiallyin conducting safety reviews. What can be done to improve the efficiencyof safety reviews for the carriers? Should FHWA allow these carriers toperform their own reviews or mail documentation to FHWA or a State so thatan off-site rview could be conducted?Limited Private Motor Carriers of Passengers (Group II)Since the drivers of the vehicles for these carriers are not specificallyhired as drivers, the majority of the driver qualification requirementsincluded in the FMCSRs would not apply to these entities. As discussedearlier, these drivers will be subject to the CDL testing and licensingstandards. Those standards (Part 383) require each driver who applies fora CDL and wants to operate in interstate commerce to certify that he/sheat least meets the following qualifications: (1) Is at least 21 years old;(2) Can read and speak the English language sufficiently to converse withthe general public, to understand highway traffic signs and signals inthe English language, to respond to official inquiries; (3) Is physicallyqualified to drive a motor vehicle in accordance with Subpart E_PhysicalQualifications and Examinations of Part 391; and (4) Is not disqualifiedto drive a motor vehicle under the rules in andSection;391.15 (i.e., lossof driving privileges by reason of revocation, suspension, withdrawal,or denial of operator's license). The FHWA believes that these requirementswill be adequate to ensure that drivers are properly qualified for thelevel and type of driving of those drivers.The FHWA believes that the interstate operations of these entities willbe intermittent. As previously cited, only 4 percent of accidents in theaccident data base were related to hours of service. The FHWA believes,however, that the driving and on-duty limitation contained in the hours-of-serviceregulations are appropriate for the private movement of passengers. Thedrivers of these operations, however, generally will not, be totally familiarwith the specific recordkeeping requirements regarding hours of servicerequirements, that is, the record of duty status, commonly known as thelog book. Furthermore, the record retention requirements placed on themotor carrier would be unnecessary given the intermittent nature of theseoperations. Thus, while imposing the driving and on-duty limitations toGroup II carriers, the FHWA does not propose that these carriers and theirdrivers be subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Part 395_Hoursof Service of Drivers.The FHWA believes random roadside inspections by State enforcement personneland the CDL requirements are sufficient to ensure the safe operation ofthese vehicles and is proposing not to subject the Group II carriers tosafety reviews, including assigning them a motor carrier identificationnumber. The FHWA appreciates comments on the proposal including specificcomments on how to ensure that these carriers are in fact meeting the requirementsother than through random roadside checks and CDL enforcement. The FHWAalso would like comments on how to identify the motor carrier responsiblefor a vehicle's violations and accident reports without an identificationnumber.The National Governor's Association (NGA) and the FHWA have developed andbegun to implement a project on truck and bus accident data uniformity.The FHWA believes that once implemented nationwide, the NGA project whichis in a multi-State pilot stage, should produce sufficient data on busaccidents. At this time, however, the reporting of accidents of Part 394would be required of all private carriers of passengers. The FHWA requestscomments on whether Group II motor carriers should be required to submitaccident reports to FHWA.<ITAG tagnum="81">Vehicle Requirements</ITAG>Under the FMCSRs it is the responsibility of the motor carrier to maintainthe vehicle in safe operating condition and together with the driver, toidentify and correct all defects before the vehicle is used in interstatecommerce. In addition, 49 CFR 393, Parts and Accessories Necessary forSafe Operation, and 49 CFR Part 396, Inspection, Repair and Maintenance,provide detailed safety requirements for commercial motor vehicle componentsand the inspection of these components. The FHWA published revisions toParts 393 and 396 on December 7, 1988 (53 FR 49380 and 49402). The revisionto Part 396 establishes an annual vehicle inspection requirement effectiveDecember 7, 1989.Motor vehicles are also subject to the safety standards for new vehiclesknown as the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, (FMVSS), promulgatedby the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (49 CFR Part571). A copy of the FMVSS are available for review in the docket room andmay be purchased from the Government Printing Office.The FHWA believes that vehicle standards contained in the FMCSRs and FMVSSshould be applicable to all private motor carriers of passenger operations.Therefore, the FHWA is proposing that within one year from the effectivedate of this rule all motor carriers and drivers would be required to meetthe pre-trip, post-trip and annual inspection requirements of Part 396for their vehicles subject to this proposed rule. These vehicles wouldalso be subject to random roadside vehicle inspections beginning one yearfrom the date of publication of the final rule.The FHWA is proposing that all commercial motor vehicles in both groupsmeet the applicable vehicle standards in place at the time of manufacturefor the specific vehicle type. As noted earlier, new commercial motor vehiclesare also subject to the FMVSS. Generally, the FMVSS and the FMCSRs arecomplementary_the FMVSS address standards for new vehicles while the FMCSRsaddress standards for vehicles in use in interstate commerce. One areawhere they differ is in the standards for fuel systems. The FMVSS onlyaddress passenger vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of10,000 pounds or less and for school buses with a GVWR greater than 10,000pounds (49 CFR 571.301). The FMCSRs (49 CFR 393.67) sets construction andstrength requirements for components of the fuel system.The FHWA does not intend to require vehicles currently owned by privatemotor carriers of passengers that were manufactured to the FMVSS standardsto also be subject to the different vehicle fuel system standards for usein vehicles contained in 49 CFR 393.67, Liquid fuel tanks. Nor does theFHWA intend to require private motor carriers of passengers to replaceequipment owned by the motor carrier on the date of publication of thefinal rule which may not meet the standards contained in the FMCSRs orthe FMVSS if the equipment has been maintained and meets the manufacturer'soriginal standards. Therefore, the FHWA is proposing that the fuel systemsof commercial motor vehicles owned by private motor carriers of passengersas of the date of publication of the final rule of this proposed rule bein compliance in accordance with either 49 CFR 393.67 (for vehicles manufacturedfor use in interstate commerce) or 49 CFR 571.301 (for small buses andschool buses) in effect at the time of manufacture of the vehicle. TheFHWA believes that all buses currently operated have been manufacturedto FMVSS or FMCSRs standards and that the proposal will not require theretrofitting of vehicles already owned by private carriers of passengers.The FHWA would like comments and information on this proposal.The FHWA believes that buses operating in interstate commerce and manufacturedto standards contained in either the FMCSRs or the FMVSS should be maintainedto those standards at a minimum and be in a safe, working condition. Thisproposal is based on the premise that current owners of such vehicles haveand will continue to maintain them in a safe condition. Therefore, theFHWA does not anticipate that there will be any major retrofitting required.As stated earlier, the FMCSRs and the FMVSS are complementary and bothstandards generally provide for grandfathering of vehicles when new safetystandards are issued. The FHWA intends to continue this policy. However, the FHWA recognizes the possibility of a vehicle being manufacturedto standards other than those contained in either the FMCSRs or the FMVSS.An example of this situation is a bus that was manufactured prior to theestablishment of FMVSS and was not operated in interstate commerce (andtherefore not subject to the FMCSRs). In such situations, if any exists,there is the possibility of extensive retrofitting to bring the vehiclein compliance with the requirements of the FMCSRs. Since the FMVSS wereestablished in 1968, the FHWA does not believe there are many vehiclesin this situation that operate in interstate commerce. Comments are requestedon such situations or other situations which may require major retrofitting.The FHWA believes that some private motor carriers of passengers may needto perform maintenance on certain parts and accessories where repairs havebeen deferred or perform minor retrofitting to bring their vehicles incompliance with the requirements of Part 393. For example, Section 393.90,Buses, standee line or bar, requires a specified line and sign to indicatethat passengers cannot occupy any space forward of the line while the busis being operated. Another provision of Part 393 which may require a motorcarrier to perform some retrofitting is andSection; 393.89, Buses, driveshaft protection. This section requires a bracket at the end of the driveshaft. The FHWA anticipates that most of the vehicles operated by privatemotor carriers of passengers already meet these requirements and thereforewould not have to perform such retrofitting. Comments on this issue arealso requested. The FHWA is inviting comment to determine whether there is a need for,or the feasibility of, retrofitting older passenger vehicles used by thesegroups. We would also appreciate any informational data that would assistin establishing the cost of retrofitting those vehicles. A private motor carrier of passengers may continue to operate a vehiclenot subject to either 49 CFR 393.67 or 49 CFR 571.301 at the time of itsmanufacture with existing fuel tanks provided the vehicle was owned bythe private motor carrier of passengers on the date of publication of thefinal rule and the fuel tanks maintained to a safe level and the vehiclemeets the other requirements of the FMCSRs. Vehicles purchased by privatemotor carriers of passengers for use in interstate commerce after the dateof publication of the final rule would need to meet the vehicle safetystandards in 49 CFR Part 393 in their entirety, including the fuel systemstandards. The FHWA intends to conduct an educational program to inform these privatemotor carriers of passengers of the requirements once the final rule isissued. The FHWA requests comments on what level of education is neededand the form this educational program should take. These vehicle standards are proposed to be effective one year from thedate of publication of the rule. The other rules proposed in this NPRMare effective within one year, without any additional phase-in period.The FHWA believes that this rule will adequately ensure the safety of passengersof these vehicles as well as the traveling public without placing an undueburden on these motor carriers. Figure 1 depicts the proposed application of the FMCSRs as they would affecteach group along with the currently regulated carriers. Currently the FMCSRsrequirements apply to all for-hire motor carriers and their drivers operatingin interstate transportation. Proposed Group I motor carriers and theirdrivers would be required to meet the same requirements. Those motor carriersand their drivers contained in Group II classification would be requiredto comply with the requirements of 49 CFR Part 383 (the Commercial Driver'sLicense Standards; Requirements and Penalties), and the applicable requirementsof Parts 392, 393, 394, 395 and 396. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Figure </T4>1._<T4>Applying the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to PrivateCarriers of Passengers</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">(Note: Rules would apply to interstate transportation.

Drivers proposed to be covered by this rule are subject to the currentrequirements implementing the Act regarding commercial drivers' licenses;therefore, revisions to 49 CFR Part 383 are not necessary. Part 390_General This part describes who is subject to the FMCSRs and contains the definitionsused in other parts of the FMCSRs. The proposed rule would modify the definition of ``motor carrier'' to include``private motor carrier of passengers.'' The definitions in Part 390 wouldalso be modified to add the definition of a ``limited private motor carrierof passengers.'' This definition is needed to define the carriers whichfall into the Group II category discussed in this NPRM. These changes wouldsubject private motor carriers of passengers to tha FMCSRs and would definethe Group II carriers that would be excluded from certain requirements.Section 390.21 is also being modified to require private motor carriersof passengers to mark their motor vehicles. A ``limited private motor carrierof passengers'' would be exempt from obtaining a DOT motor carrier identificationnumber (andSection; 390.21(b)(3)). Part 391_Qualification of Drivers This part contains the requirements pertaining to qualifications of drivers.Section 391.2(c) is added to exempt those persons who drive soley for alimited private motor carrier of passengers from having to be medicallyexamined, to obtain a certificate of medical examination, and to carrya medical examiner's certificate on his/her person. While these personsmust be medically qualified to drive in interstate commerce consistentwith the CDL requirements (Part 383), they need not obtain a medical examiner'scertificate. A new paragraph (andSection; 391.61(b)) is added to allow currentdrivers of private motor carriers of passengers to be waived from certaindriver checks by the employer. This proposal does not require major retrofittingof any equipment if it has been maintained and meets the standards fornewly manufactured vehicles in place at the time of manufacture. Part 392_Driving of Motor Vehicles This part contains the provisions of the FMCSRs regarding the operationsof commercial motor vehicles. Section 392.1 is changed to add ``driver''in order to specify that volunteer or unpaid drivers are subject to therule if operating for a limited private motor carrier of passengers. Part 393_Parts and Accessories Necessary for Safe Operation This part contains the majority of the vehicle equipment design and performancestandards for commercial motor vehicles operating in interstate commerce.Section 393.1 would be redesignated as andSection; 393.1(a) and revised toadd ``drivers'' to the entities which would need to comply with the part.This change is needed to ensure that volunteer drivers and limited privatemotor carriers of passengers are subject to the vehicle standards. Section 393.1(b) would be added to specify that private motor carriersof passengers do not have to replace or retrofit the fuel systems on vehicleswhich they own on the date of publication of the final rule. The fuel systems,however, would be maintained to the standard (FMVSS and FMCSRs) for whichthe systems were originally manufactured. This section would also requirenew vehicles purchased or leased for interstate commerce after the finalrule publication date to meet requirements of Subpart E. All other requirementsof Part 393 will apply to limited private carriers of passengers. Thisdoes not require retrofitting of any equipment if it has been maintainedand meets the original manufacturer's standards. Part 394_Notification and Reporting of Accidents Part 394 of the FMCSRs establishes the requirement that all interstatemotor carriers comply with the notification and accident reporting requirementsof that part. Part 394 defines the criteria for reportable accidents; callsfor the immediate notification in case of a fatal accident; states who,when, how, and what to report in case of a reportable accident; how toreport accident-related deaths that occur after a report has been submitted;and requires the reporting motor carrier to assist in investigations andspecial studies. As discussed previously, the FHWA does not have direct accident data oninterstate private motor carriers of passengers, and accident data on intrastateprivate motor carriers of passengers are not readily available from individualStates. To identify unsafe private carriers of passengers and for the futureevaluation and analysis of these proposed safety standards for interstateprivate motor carriers of passengers and their drivers, it is essentialthat accident data be collected. Therefore, all interstate private motorcarriers of passengers would be required to file accident reports withthe FHWA on reportable accidents and would be required to meet the otherrequirements found in Part 394 of this subchapter.As a result of an applicability change in 49 CFR 390.3, all private motorcarriers of passengers would be subject to this part. No revisions areneeded to this part. The FHWA will continue to monitor the progress made with uniform accidentreports from the States from the NGA pilot program. If that informationbecomes an effective alternative to motor carrier supplied accident data,the FHWA will consider elimination of this provision of the proposed rule.Part 395_Hours of Service of DriversPart 395 establishes maximum driving and on-duty time (working in additionto driving). A driver cannot drive more than 10 hours following 8 consecutivehours off duty. A driver may not drive after being on duty for more than15 hours following 8 consecutive hours off duty. A driver may not driveafter being on duty more than 60 hours in any 7 consecutive days. A drivermay not drive after being on duty more than 70 hours in any 8 consecutivedays if the carrier operates every day in the week. These standards arethe responsibility of both the motor carrier and the driver. The FHWA proposesthat all private motor carriers of passengers be subject to the hours ofservice requirements. Drivers for limited private motor carriers of passengerswould not be required to prepare the driver's record of duty status. Commentsare requested on this proposal and on the need to ensure that these driversdo not exceed the 10 hour maximum driving rule, or operating a motor vehicleafter having been on duty more than 15 hours. Section 395.8(1), Exemptions,would be modified to exclude limited private carriers of passengers fromthe recordkeeping requirements.Part 396_Inspection, Repair and MaintenanceThis part requires that all vehicles must be inspected, repaired and maintainedin a safe condition in accordance with the vehicle standards containedin Part 393. As a result of an applicability change in 49 CFR 390.3, all private motorcarriers of passengers would be subject to this part. No revisions areneeded to this part.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Impact Evaluation</ITAG>The impact of this proposal will not result in an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million, a major increase in costs or prices, or have asignificant adverse effect on the nation's economy. The FHWA has determinedthat this document does not contain a major rule under Executive Order12291. However, because of the public interest in commercial motor vehiclesafety that this rule addresses, it is considered a significant regulationunder the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation.The safety benefits and opportunities for benefits to be derived from thisrule will offset any cost. A draft regulatory evaluation has been preparedand is available for review in the public docket. Based on the informationavailable to the FHWA at this time, this action, if promulgated, will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.In its draft regulatory evaluation the FHWA estimates that this rule willimpose societal costs of $3 million while creating benefits of $35 million,each year. Thus the ratio of benefits to costs is 11 to 1. Even if theanalysis has errors induced by lack of data, the benefits will far exceedthe costs. A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be usedto cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment</ITAG> This proposed regulation amends certain parts of the FMCSRs pertainingto the scope and applicability of the FMCSRs to interstate transportationby private motor carriers of passengers as authorized by the Motor CarrierSafety Act of 1984. Nothing in this document directly preempts any Statelaw or regulation. The FMCSRs establish minimum safety regulations which,at the current time, may be supplemented by the States, except for theadoption of inconsistent regulations. The statutory basis for Federal regulationof interstate commerce has been outlined above. Accordingly, it is certifiedthat the policies contained in this document have been assessed in lightof the principles, criteria, and requirements of the Federalism ExecutiveOrder.<ITAG tagnum="84"> List of Subjects in 49 CFR Parts 390, 391, 392, 393, and 395 </ITAG>Commercial drivers license standards requirements and penalties, Highwaysafety, Highway and roads, Motor carriers, Motor vehicle safety, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements, Driver's hours of service.<ITAG tagnum="20"> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217, MotorCarrier Safety)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> Issued on: February 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
