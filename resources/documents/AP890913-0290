Digital, the nation's second largest computer firm, has never hada layoff in its 31-year-history and said it has no plans for one.   Under intense price competition and declining U.S. sales,however, the Maynard-based company is undertaking what it calls a``work force transition'' to reduce its manufacturing payroll by4,000 jobs this year through redeployment and retraining. Thevoluntary severance package was not connected with the largereffort, said Jeff Gibson, a Digital spokesman.   The plan was offered Tuesday to 500 workers at Digital's formersystems manufacturing plant in Salem, N.H., and 200 employees basedat other sites whose jobs are related to the Salem facility.   Digital said it expects several hundred employees to accept theoffer. Those who choose not to leave the company may be transferred.   Digital now employs 125,800 people worldwide, including 33,600 inMassachusetts. In May, the company froze the salaries of all of its73,500 employees in the United States. Employees at foreignfacilities were not affected because sales overseas have remainedstrong.   Digital spokeswoman Nikki Richardson said the severance packagewill include 40 weeks of py for employees with less than two yearsof service.   Employees with three to 10 years of service are also eligible for40 weeks of pay, plus three additional weeks for every year ofservice over three years. That means a 10-year veteran would get 61weeks of pay.   Employees with more than 10 years of service would get 64 weeksof pay, plus four more weeks for each year between 11 and 20. Themaximum award is 104 weeks of pay.   In addition, Digital will maintain medical, dental and lifeinsurance coverage for the employees for one year. And the companysaid it will provide free outplacement services.</TEXT></DOC>
