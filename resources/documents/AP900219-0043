Three opposition assemblymen were dragged by about 60 policeofficers from the convention hall where the National Assemblyconvened today for the election. They had occupied the podium androughed up officials who tried to stop their demonstration.   The protesters opposed the choice of Hsueh Yueh, a 94-year-oldretired army general, to preside over the 35-day meeting.   Opposition Assemblyman Tsai Shi-yuan told the convention thatchoosing Hsueh ``was absurd because he is what the public considersan old thief who has not faced re-election'' in more than fourdecades.   The 752-seat National Assembly includes 646 members elected inChina before 1949, when they fled to Taiwan with the rest of theNationalist Chinese government after it lost a civil war toCommunist forces.   The aging assemblymen were frozen in office to support theNationalist Party's claim that it still is the legitimate ruler ofChina. Most are at least 70 years old, and several die each year.Before the session began, a 73-year-old member had a heart attackat the convention hall and was hospitalized in intensive care.   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which has just 11seats in parliament, has staged protests calling for the directelection of Taiwan's president and vice president.   Police released the detained opposition assemblymen from alocked bus after they smashed the windows with umbrellas. Theyquickly returned to the meeting hall and kicked in glass doorswhile President Lee Teng-hui was delivering a speech calling for``a society with harmony, unity, law and order.''   Lee, who was nominated as the ruling Nationalist Party'spresidential candidate on Feb. 11, paused briefly during thecommotion before continuing his speech. Later, oppositionAssemblyman Huang Chao-hui overturned several tables at a luncheonbanquet as Lee toasted the elderly members.   During the National Assembly convention, the body will reviewthe constitution, including a temporary provision that gives thepresident the right to retire all members elected on the mainland.Many assemblymen oppose that provision.   The convention will end with the election of Taiwan's nextpresident and vice president.   Lee won the universal support of the Nationalist Party's CentralCommittee for a full six-year term as president, but many partyelders were disappointed that he picked a personal aide, LiYuan-zu, as running mate.   More than 200 aging assemblymen had supported Chiang Wego, a sonof the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, to be the vicepresidential candidate.   Lee, the first Taiwan native ever to serve as Nationalistpresident, assumed that office in January 1988 upon the death ofPresident Chiang Ching-guo, another son of Chiang Kai-shek.</TEXT></DOC>
