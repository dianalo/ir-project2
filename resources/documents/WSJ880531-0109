The 93-5 vote gave President Reagan a cherished foreign policy achievement. It was greeted by a rare, prolonged standing ovation from spectators in the Senate galleries.    The only senators voting against approval were Republicans Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, Steve Symms of Idaho and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, and Democrat Ernest Hollings of South Carolina.    The treaty is the first arms-control pact ratified by the U.S. in 16 years. It also is the first pact ever to require the destruction of nuclear weapons, rather than a mere slowdown in the growth of arsenals.    It calls for the elimination, within three years, of 830 U.S. and 1,752 Soviet missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, or between 310 and 3,410 miles. The Soviets would have to retire more warheads than the U.S., because many of the Soviet missiles each carry three payloads, while all of the U.S. missiles have only one warhead each.    To ensure that both sides live up to their commitments, the treaty provides for the most ambitious verification arrangements in history. Over a period of 13 years, the U.S. and Soviet Union would station inspection teams on each other's soil to make sure neither side secretly produced missiles banned by the agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
