Mario Cuomo of New York and forDemocrats around the country, the zero hour is at hand.   Although no one safely can predict the workings of thegovernor's mind, all signs point to the conclusion that Mr.Cuomo will finally jump into the Democratic presidential racetoday. The filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary,which on Feb. 18 kicks off the political season, is at 5 p.m.today.</LP><TEXT>   If Mr. Cuomo does file for the primary, he'll usher in anew phase in the 1992 presidential campaign.   Mr. Cuomo, 59 years old, instantly would become theDemocratic front-runner -- at once the favorite of Democraticregulars, liberals, ethnics and intellectuals. But the firstnational campaign of an untested, even provincial, politicalfigure who has no campaign structure and no organizationalunderpinnings -- and who seeks little advice and ignores mostof what he does get -- would face enormous obstacles.   &quot;His first challenge is to try to bring the expectationsback into control,&quot; says Gregory Schneiders, a Democraticpolitical consultant. &quot;No candidate can do as well as peopleexpect Cuomo will.&quot;   Of course, Mr. Cuomo could find some wiggle room intoday's deadline. He could file the papers but say that hewon't be a candidate unless he and legislative leaders inAlbany, N.Y., reach a satisfactory conclusion to their budgetnegotiations.   As he stands on the brink of a presidential campaign, Mr.Cuomo will be tested by the public's memory of 1980: Wouldthe New York governor be the 1992 analogue of Edward Kennedyor would he be the contemporary version of Ronald Reagan?   Both men entered the 1980 campaign with promise and with areputation for being unusually articulate, but Mr. Reagan wasprepared for the race and could explain why he wanted to bepresident -- two simple hurdles that Mr. Kennedy failed toclear.   Sometimes electrifying, sometimes elusive, almost alwaysenigmatic, Mr. Cuomo is articulate as well. After NancyReagan heard him speak at a Washington dinner several yearsago, she told friends George Bush would be no match for theNew York governor. But Mr. Cuomo still must explain hisvision of the presidency and still must articulate what drewhim into the race.   At the same time, the governor must test his appeal as aNew York ethnic in the arena of national politics and meetthe rigorous examination of rivals and reporters who willseek to determine whether there are skeletons in his past. Healso must address where he would lead the country, and defenda New York state fiscal situation that was so dire this fallthat he publicly speculated it would keep him from runningfor president.   If he runs, he'll have to fashion a national campaigneffort, with a massive money-raising operation, from scratch,and must also prepare a blitzkrieg in New Hampshire, a statewhere presidential politics usually takes on the character oftrench warfare.   &quot;Cuomo has nothing -- not a thing -- going on here rightnow, other than his advance billing,&quot; says Ned Helms, aformer New Hampshire Democratic state chairman. &quot;That's notgoing to win him the primary -- and it's very possiblesomeone else can beat him. And because he's known as thefront-runner, that gives the other six a great opportunity toknock off a giant.&quot;   Mr. Cuomo's entry would transform the presidential race,adding a well-known face to a field of Democratic candidatesso obscure that last month WTSL radio in Lebanon, N.H.,referred to two of the leading candidates as &quot;Bob Clinton&quot;and &quot;Tom Harvin.&quot;   Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa andthe others -- former Gov. Jerry Brown of California, Sen. BobKerrey of Nebraska, former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusettsand Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia -- would find themselvesin a different kind of campaign. Suddenly the six men whohave been campaigning, debating and struggling to raise moneywould be seeking to emerge as the alternatives to Mr. Cuomoas much as leading contenders themselves.   Mr. Clinton is in the best position to do so. As asoutherner, the Arkansas governor may even be elevated byCuomo's entry into the race. He's already performed wellbefore party leaders, expressed comprehensive andcomprehensible views on domestic and international questionsand is regarded as well-positioned to run the entireDemocratic marathon, which doesn't end until California, NewJersey and three other states hold primaries June 2.   Meanwhile, as he toyed and sometimes teased with hispresidential intentions, Mr. Cuomo froze both support andmoney, denying them to the others. Mr. Kerrey for one said hewas tired of the focus &quot;on the psychology&quot; of Mr. Cuomo. Andif it were his plan all along to announce at the 11th hour --some of his rivals, now resentful, believe it was -- Mr.Cuomo effectively established himself as more than the firstamong equals, but as one above the Lilliputians.   In recent months Mr. Cuomo has been testing politicalideas -- a net investment tax credit for productive machineryand pollution-control devices, a new capital-gains tax rateof about 10% to apply only to &quot;new and productive&quot;investments, an increase in the research-and-development taxcredit to 30% and, in time, liberalization of depreciationschedules. He's also called on the Federal Reserve to inject$20 billion to $25 billion into the banking system to permitbanks to make new loans to medium and small businesses.</TEXT></DOC>
