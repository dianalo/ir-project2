Israel's Histadrut labor federation called for a two-hour,nationwide strike Sunday to protest the government's handling ofthe economy. Unions affliated with Histadrut represent 85 percentof Israel's 2.5 million workers.   The nation's unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent in May, andthe Labor Ministry predicts it could exceed 10 percent beforeyear's end for the worst jobless rate since the 1965-67 recession.   Israel radio said that at the Sunday Cabinet meeting FinanceMinister Shimon Peres will unveil a public works program aimed atcreating jobs.   Thirteen Palestinians were reportedly shot and wounded Saturdayin stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops in the West Bank andGaza Strip. One victim was a 14-year-old girl hit in the chest withone of the rubber-coated metal pellets the army uses for riotcontrol, Arab hospital officials said.   An army spokesman said soldiers encountered stone-throwers inseveral early morning raids in West Bank villages and confirmedthat one Palestinian youth was shot and wounded in a raid on thevillage of Nur Shams near Nablus.   At least 572 Palestinians and 37 Israelis have been killed sincethe uprising against Israeli rule began in December 1987.   Classes opened for elementary schoolchildren and high schoolseniors, who must sit for mandatory graduation exams in November.   But the army has not yet set a date for the remaining 100,000junior high and high school students in the West Bank to return toclass and said that all institutions will be closed again ifviolence occurs.   ``If you want to learn, you have the opportunity to do so,''said Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank militarygovernment. ``If you don't, that is your choice, too.''   The army has kept West Bank schools closed for all but two shortintervals since the start of the Palestinian revolt, contendingthey were focal points for violence. They were last open in January.   Palestinians charge it was a form of ``collective punishment,''and the United States and international human rights organizationshave urged that classes be reopened.   On Saturday, the sounds of children reciting Arabic andpracticing multiplication tables could be heard in both boys' andgirls' elementary schools in Bethlehem.   Studies in the village of Beit Fajar six miles south ofBethlehem were disrupted when tear gas fired by soldiers driftedinto the girls' school. The army said troops fired the tear gas todisperse stone-throwers nearby. Otherwise, the opening day passedwithout major incidents.   School principals said attendance was more than 90 percent,despite a strike called by the fundamentalist Moslem group Hamas,or Zeal, which closed shops and shut down public transportation.   Hamas issued a leaflet exempting students from the strike, andgraffiti on walls in Ramallah north of Jerusalem signed by Hamassupporters said: ``With stones and pens, the blessed uprisingcontinues.''   ``I'm glad to be going back,'' said 9-year-old Lina Humseyeh asshe waited in Bethlehem for a private school bus to take her to herthird-grade class. ``I helped my mother when we didn't have school,but I was bored.''   The teacher of Lina's English class, Nadal Barham, said shethought closing the schools had increased rather than reducedviolence in the uprising, known by the Arabic word intefadeh.   ``I think that when students have something else to do _ notjust demonstrate _ it will decrease the intefadeh,'' she said.   While the army ordered schools closed in the West Bank shortlyafter the the uprising began, classes have continued for more than150,000 students in the Gaza Strip. Colleges, universities andvocational schools in both territories remain shut, affecting20,000 students.</TEXT></DOC>
