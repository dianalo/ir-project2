Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806-2425;telephone (213) 988-5233.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The FAA has determined that tail rotorstrap pack assemblies, Part Number (P/N) 369A1706-BSC, used with fiberglasstail rotor blades, P/N 369A1607-BSC, 369A1710-BSC, -9, -11, or -13 havea reduced finite service life compared to the same strap pack assembliesused with the aluminum tail rotor blades, P/N 369A1613. This is based uponthe FAA's receipt from the manufacturer of revised fatigue analysis substantiatingdata. Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other helicoptersof the same type design, an AD is being issued which requires removal ofthe affected strap packs from service upon reaching 3,250 hours' time inservice on MDHC Model 369A (OH-6A) and H series helicopters.Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable andgood cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of ExecutiveOrder 12291 with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediatelyto correct an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this actionis subsequently determined to involve a significant/major regulation, afinal regulatory evaluation or analysis, as appropriate, will be preparedand placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluation or analysisis not required). A copy of it, when filed, may be obtained from the RegionalRules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aircraft, aviation safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends Section 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:1. The authority citation for Part 39 continues to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1421, and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g)(Revised Pub. L. 97-449, January 12, 1983); and 14 CFR 11.89.</ITAG>2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new AD:<ITAG tagnum="26"><T4>McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company: </T4>Applies to Model 369A (OH-6A)and H series helicopters, certified in any category, which are equippedwith strap pack assemblies, P/N 369A1706-BSC, and have fiberglass tailrotor blades, P/N 369A1607-BSC, 369A1710-BSC, -9, -11 or -13, installed.(Docket No. 89-ASW-07)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Strap pack assemblies installed with aluminum tail rotorblades, P/N 369A1613, are not affected by the finite service life reductionunless the strap pack assemblies have been operated with fiberglass tailrotor blades that have been previously installed; in which case, the reductionin finite life applies.</ITAG>Compliance is required as indicated, unless already accomplished. To preventpossible fatigue failure of the tail rotor strap pack assembly, which couldresult in loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following:(a) Within 15 days after the effective date of this AD, conduct an inspectionof the helicopter log book to determine if a listed fiberglass blade is,or previously has been, installed on the affected tail rotor strap packassemblies.(b) For tail rotor strap pack assemblies, P/N 369A1706-BSC, which havebeen equipped with a listed fiberglass blade and for strap packs for whichthe blade type cannot be determined, the following applies:(1) For strap pack assemblies which have 3,200 or more hours' time in serviceon the effective date of this AD, replace the strap pack with a serviceableunit within the next 50 hours' time in service.(2) For strap pack assemblies which have less than 3,200 hours' time inservice on the effective date of this AD, replace the strap pack with aserviceable unit before the accumulation of 3,250 hours' time in service.(c) In accordance with andSection;andSection; 21.197 and 21.199, the helicoptermay be flown to a base where compliance with the AD may be accomplished.<ITAG tagnum="21">This amendment becomes effective on June 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Fort Worth, Texas, on May 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James D.
