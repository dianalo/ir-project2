The official Xinhua News Agency meanwhile reported that allloans of pandas and snub-nosed monkeys to the United States werebeing suspended ``so as to protect the endangered species.''   China, the only country where pandas live in the wild, estimatesthat fewer than 1,000 remain, threatened by poachers anddeforestation.   However, Zhang Yushan of the Forestry Ministry, which has chargeof conservation, said the new policy affects all countries, notjust the United States, and does not completely rule out futureloans.   ``It's not that pandas absolutely can't go,'' he said in atelephone interview. ``It's just that such exhibits should becontrolled.''   Zhang said if a foreign leader requests a panda loan, topChinese leaders may agree to enhance bilateral ties. However, hedeclined to say under what other conditions pandas might bereleased for exhibit abroad.   ``We believe the fewer the better, and no exhibits at all wouldbe best,'' he said. China has been sending about four pairs ofpandas abroad each year, with foreign zoos competing fiercely forthe animals.   Other officials contacted at the Forestry Ministry also refusedto spell out what the new policy would mean in practice or how itwould affect any such loans already approved.   Regardless of how China will implement the new policy, itseffect on U.S. zoos is moot.   In June, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service suspended itsissuance of import licenses for pandas, scuttling planned exhibitsin Atlanta and at the Michigan State Fair. China had approved bothloans.   The U.S. agency said it wanted to consider objections byAmerican conservation groups that the loans exploit pandas forprofit and interrupt efforts to breed them in China.   China stopped giving gift pandas to foreign zoos in the 1970sbut requests for loans of pandas for temporary exhibits abroad havemultiplied in recent years.   Six U.S. zoos as well as zoos in Belgium, Australia and Japanhave received separate pairs of loan pandas. Many more have asked,using banquet diplomacy and high-ranking connections in an effortto win Chinese approval.   Zoos receiving loan pandas generally pay China $300,000 to$500,000 but often take in much more than that in increased ticketsales, prompting both the Chinese and the foreign zoos to accuseeach other of profiteering from the pandas.   ``Foreign zoos often make a lot of money,'' Zhang said. ``We'renot saying they shouldn't make money, but there should be someother reason for the exhibit.''</TEXT></DOC>
