Sources close to the Syrian delegation said Tehran reiteratedits pledge to uphold embargo rules imposed by the U.N. SecurityCouncil after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.   But Iran insisted it is not breaking the sanctions because theembargo allows ``humanitarian shipments'' of food.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theIranians had promised not to buy embargoed Iraqi oil, or to helpBaghdad export its crude.   An Iranian newspaper had said Assad carried an appeal from theUnited States against food shipments as well.   Assad failed to see eye-to-eye with Iranian President HashemiRafsanjani on many issues, but those differences were not greatenough to drive a wedge between Iran and its main Arab ally, thesources said.   The first indication that things were not going well for Assadcame when he announced Sunday he was extending his stay, apparentlyfor a last-ditch effort in trying to impress upon Rafsanjani theimportance of witholding food shipments to Iraq.   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Assad was seen off atTehran's Mehrabad airport by Rafsanjani.   Before departing, Assad said the results of his talks had been``good and very effective.''   He said his meetings with Rafsanjani had been ``friendly, and Idon't think anything relating to the region remained undiscussed.''   Rafsanjani said ``in our talks we did not reach any point ofdifference requiring a great deal of discussions.''   The English-language Tehran Times said some of Rafsanjani'sdiscussions with Assad, conducted behind closed doors, had lastedseveral hours.   The report did not provide any details of those meetings.   Besides the embargo, the two are also believed to have discussedthe fate of 13 Western hostages in Lebanon.   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
