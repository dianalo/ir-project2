Although the Senate isn't expected to take up the measure, Congress now expects a presidential report to be produced soon, whether or not it is required by law.    &quot;We now have both houses of Congress firmly on record expressing reservations about the course of administration policy in the Persian Gulf, and insisting that congress be kept fully informed,&quot; Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) said in a statement.    The Senate had previously passed a somewhat tougher measure and attached it to a bill that is still being debated, and senators are insisting that tougher language of some sort be adopted. Reagan administration officials have said the president would sign the House measure and quickly comply with its demands.    The House measure, which was passed 302-105, stems from the considerable anxiety on Capitol Hill over the prospect for expanded U.S. military involvement in the Persian Gulf following last month's attack on the USS Stark by an Iraqi jet. The sole controversy stirred by the congressional request for information involved the fear of some members that the measure might be seen as tacit approval of the president's oil-tanker policy -- a charge vigorously denied by the leaders of both parties who sponsored the bill in the House.    Both the House and Senate bills would require the president to submit an extensive report to Congress. The House measure would require the report within seven days of its enactment, while the Senate would require a report before any action is taken to put Kuwaiti ships under the protection of the U.S. flag.    Both measures would require that the presidential report include an assessment of the threats to the American forces that protect the 11 Kuwaiti ships; describe the circumstances under which American warships and fighter planes would open fire if provoked; and provide details of the arrangements entered into by the U.S. government to share responsibility for protecting the vessels with other countries that have interests in the region.    Some senators were insisting on tougher language, and Sen. Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.) proposed invoking the War Powers Act provisions that would require congressional approval for continued military action after a limited period.    A flap developed in the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday morning, when members of both parties expressed concern that the legislation sanctioned, in a back-handed way, the placing of American flags on the tankers. As a result, the committee voted to table the measure rather than report it to the House floor, as the House leaders wanted. The measure later reached the House floor after lawmakers voted to suspend the rules.    &quot;This resolution puts congressional fingerprints on our actions in the gulf,&quot; contended Rep. Toby Roth (R., Wis.), in an impassioned speech against the bill on the House floor. &quot;A war is coming. I don't want Congress's fingerprints on it.&quot;    But the leadership, represented by House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.), produced a series of lawmakers who argued that the measure did nothing more than demand information that the White House had appeared reluctant to produce. Some members argued that it sent a signal that Congress wanted the White House to move with caution in the region. &quot;They're going down the wrong path,&quot; Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.) contended about the Reagan administration. &quot;This resolution slows them down.&quot;    Meanwhile, statements from different branches of the Reagan administration suggest varying visions of the expanding U.S. role in the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon yesterday attempted to tone down the rhetoric on the Navy escorts there, while Secretary of State George Shultz cast the pending operations as part of a global struggle for dominance in the oil-rich region.    The chief spokesman for the Defense Department denied reports that the U.S. intended to protect all commercial shipping in the gulf. Rather, he said, the Navy is protecting 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers that will be reflagged to sail under American protection. In addition, he said the Navy &quot;on a case-by-case basis&quot; will escort certain vessels carrying U.S. military equipment to neutral Arab states under standard foreign military-sale arrangements. The Navy recently provided one such escort.    By contrast, Secretary Shultz told reporters that the &quot;oil pool in the Gulf is likely to be more important in the future rather than less important.&quot; He added that &quot;the free world has a major stake in maintaining its ability to see that nobody else can dominate that oil pool.&quot;    Asked if the U.S. needed allied help in the gulf, Mr. Shultz said, &quot;not necessarily.&quot; Although administration officials have said that it would be beneficial to have help from allies, as well as basing rights in friendly Arab states, neither has materialized. </TEXT></DOC>
