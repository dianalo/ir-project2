The data on television viewing gathered by A.C. NielsenCo. have been the unquestioned currency of the business,dictating how billions of advertising dollars are spent anddetermining which shows survive and which ones falter.Customers didn't mind the monopoly: One set of numbers from asingle supplier made things less complicated.</LP><TEXT>   But now television has turned the tables: It is rating theNielsens -- and it's not pleased with the result.   The company is under fire, its numbers are suspect, andnew rivals are lining up to exploit the tumult. A growingnumber of television executives claim that the Nielsen system-- particularly the remote control &quot;people meter&quot; deviceNielsen families use to log who watches what -- hasfundamental flaws. New studies contend the ratingssignificantly understate viewing in a number of ways,especially by children and young adults and people in bars,hotels and on vacation.   Nielsen's trouble began a few months ago, when itsnumbers, based on 4,093 homes that are supposed to represent92.1 million households, showed millions of people suddenlyceasing to watch TV. Network viewing had been slowlydeclining for several years, but overall television viewinghad remained steady for decades. This sudden, severe falloffin total TV viewing was unprecedented.   The networks went ballistic, rueful over having to givesponsors $100 million in free commercials to cover theratings decline of the first quarter alone. Something had tobe wrong, they argued. They later imposed the first majorchange in how ratings are guaranteed to advertisers, usingeight-year trends instead of just the current year'sNielsens.   &quot;As a researcher, I've got to have confidence in thenumbers, and I don't,&quot; says Alan Wurtzel, senior vicepresident of research at Capital Cities/ABC Inc. &quot;We continueto do business based on numbers that are suspect, and we canonly do that for a short time.&quot;   Nielsen officials defend their system as proven, accurateand rigorously tested. John Dimling, executive vice presidentat A.C. Nielsen's rating service, Nielsen Media Research,notes that despite network complaints, the ad industry'smajor trade group has endorsed the system.   Nevertheless, would-be rivals see an opening.Britain-based Pergamon AGB PLC says it will re-enter the U.S.market soon; two years ago, it racked up losses of $67million in an effort that Nielsen soundly stomped. ArbitronCo., Nielsen's only major rival in local-market TV ratings,has set a fall start for a much-delayed system it wants totake nationwide by late next year.   But any dive into Nielsen's domain may well belly-flop.&quot;It's anyone's prerogative to come into this market,&quot; saysWilliam G. Jacobi, executive vice president of Nielsen MediaResearch. &quot;But if they do, we are going to fight them toothand nail. This is a business we love, and we're going todefend it with every resource we have.&quot;   The sometimes sleepy giant is known for aggressive andshrewd tactics when challenged. Acquired by Dun andamp; BradstreetCorp. in 1984, Nielsen has annual sales of more than $600million. Yet only about $50 million comes from nationaltelevision ratings. (About two-thirds of the company's totalrevenue is from tracking the sale of packaged goods at retailstores.) So it is questionable whether the market can supportmore than one major player.   After the networks screamed about the measured drop inviewing, Nielsen reviewed its procedures and pronounced thesystem healthy. Maybe, the company said, the drop was due tonormally sedentary sofa spuds heading outside to enjoyunusually warm winter weather. But anomalies kept croppingup.   In some cases, curiously, the households watchingtelevision held steady with a year ago, yet in specific agegroups the viewing fell sharply. In March, Nielsen noted onlya 2% drop in households watching all channels in prime time,but women aged 18 to 34 inexplicably had a deeper decline of8%. In April, late-night viewing fell only 3% in homes, yetplunged 13% for men under age 35, the Nielsen ratings showed.   How, the networks demanded, could overall viewing be aboutthe same yet decline so sharply in specific groups?   The national numbers, moreover, contradicted Nielsen's ownlocal-market ratings derived from 200,000 diaries in thenation's 200 television markets. In February, the localmarkets saw no real change in TV viewing from a year before-- but the national numbers logged a 5% drop.   In May, according to the local surveys, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;was in second place among the three network newscasts, withan audience of 9.2 million people. Yet in the nationalnumbers, NBC was mired in third place, with 1.7 million fewerviewers.   Television executives and even some people in the adindustry have been quick to take note. &quot;There's somesuspicion the numbers are flawed,&quot; says Paul Isacsson,executive vice president at Young andamp; Rubicam Inc. He worriesthat they make it look as if ad agencies are paying higherprices for fewer and fewer viewers.   If the numbers are flawed, the culprit may be the peoplemeter, the newfangled device that Nielsen introduced --reluctantly -- for national ratings in late 1987. Beforethen, Nielsen had used diaries. Diaries were a lot cheaper,but they were prone to error, especially as the number ofchannels expanded with the rise of cable in the mid-1980s.Viewers forgot what they had watched and simply guessed.   Nielsen had tested the people meter since 1977 withoutever using it. Nielsen might have waited years more beforeswitching, but for a rare outbreak of competition in 1985.British upstart AGB had entered the U.S brandishing thepeople meter as a major selling point.   The people meter works like a remote control. Each viewerpresses some buttons when he or she starts or stops watchingTV. When the set is on, a separate meter automaticallyrecords the channel the set is tuned to. But even if the setis turned on, what matters most is that someone has pressedbuttons showing that there's really a viewer, or severalviewers. Even the youngest tots are expected to use the gizmowhen they tumble out of bed at dawn for Saturday cartoons.   For adults, too, this is an onerous burden ofbutton-pushing, especially when a Nielsen home is expected todo it diligently for up to two years. That may be why almosthalf of homes refuse when Nielsen asks them to join itspeople meter sample, and why only 47% stay on as members ofthe Nielsen system.   The rate of cooperation may distort the random nature thatthe system needs to represent an entire nation's viewing.Viewers who agree to use the people meter may besystematically different in their television habits fromthose who refuse. &quot;It's an enormous potential source ofbias,&quot; says Persi Diaconis, a statistician at the Universityof Illinois.   Nielsen's Mr. Jacobi, however, says getting 47% of homesto cooperate &quot;is an admirable achievement.&quot;   Nielsen still uses diaries alone in 175 of the 200 TVmarkets for local ratings, because people meters would be toocostly to install everywhere. Critics say this might helpexplain the difference between the national ratings andfigures derived from local reports.   For households that agree to use a people meter in thenational sample, &quot;user fatigue&quot; may understate viewing.Nielsen data show the longer some viewers, particularlyyounger ones, have the time-consuming device, the less theyuse it.   Among men aged 18 to 34, for example, newcomers using thepeople meter only three months appear to watch 17% moretelevision than the Nielsen sample overall, a new study bythe firm Statistical Research Inc. finds. At the one-yearpoint they watch about the same load as the overall sample, asign that they may have grown lax in their button-pushingduties.   That argument is strengthened by a new phone survey thefirm did of 26,000 homes, says William Rubens, a longtime NBCratings executive who now consults to the networks. Thesurvey indicated that 26% more men aged 18 to 34 and 33% morekids were watching TV than Nielsen showed for the sameperiod. &quot;It's an inescapable conclusion,&quot; he says, that someparts of the Nielsen system are a biased representation ofthe public's viewing.   Nielsen's Mr. Dimling says that the phone survey, like anysurvey, may have its own problems and adds that the surveyresults closely followed Nielsen figures for the broadcategory of viewers aged two and above.   The phone survey also showed 52% more visitors watchingtelevision in other people's homes than Nielsen reported. AndNielsen appears to understate other &quot;out-of-home&quot; viewing.Because its people meters are based only in homes,TV-watching in bars, hotels and other public places isn'tcounted. Nor does Nielsen count viewing once a family turnsoff the set and heads for a vacation. About 20% of the U.S.public is on vacation during any given week of the summermonths, and studies find 80% of people on vacation watch TV.   In addition to griping about Nielsen's numbers, somecustomers are growing weary of dealing with a monopoly andare looking for alternatives, such as AGB's failed effort twoyears ago. &quot;The real killer was aborting the competitiveprocess before it bore fruit,&quot; says CBS Inc. senior vicepresident David Poltrack, who supported AGB's effort.   AGB failed in its first attempt partly because it didn'tanticipate the huge investment required and the complexity oftracking thousands of hours of programs. But counter-moves byNielsen hurt too. In October 1985, just as AGB was unveilingthe results of its first test, Nielsen announced its ownpeople meter plans -- though Nielsen didn't switch to thecontraption for two years. The company dealt another blow byhiring away AGB's U.S. president, Joseph Philport, monthsbefore the AGB service was to go nationwide.   Last month, AGB announced plans to re-enter theU.S.market, saying it had been &quot;invited&quot; by the threenetworks. The fight could be nasty -- and petty. Nielsen'sMr. Jacobi accused AGB of &quot;false pretenses&quot; because, henotes, no formal invitation had been issued to the company.   &quot;The attack is really quite ridiculous,&quot; says RobertMaxwell, the Britain-based tabloid publisher and chairman ofMaxwell Communication Corp., who bought AGB 18 months ago. Hecalls Mr. Jacobi a &quot;monopolist&quot; and adds: &quot;We are indiscussions with the networks and continue to be.&quot;   Mr. Maxwell says AGB can set up in the U.S. on aninvestment of up to $40 million and an annual budget of $30million. But others say $100 million is a more likelystart-up figure. And so far, only the three networks areinterested in AGB.   &quot;If AGB is considered the handmaiden of the networks, evenif they're doing things right, the effort will be tainted,&quot;says consultant Norman Hecht, a former AGB executive.   It also raises revenue questions. The Big Three now payNielsen only $15 million combined, less than one-third of the$50 million a year in revenue Nielsen gets for its nationaltelevision ratings service. The rest comes from ad agencies,advertisers and cable channels, which so far aren'texpressing much interest in AGB.   Nor are Nielsen's customers clamoring, as yet, for a newservice called ScanAmerica, from Arbitron. The service wouldtrack both TV viewing and product purchases by the samesample of families.   Arbitron plans to be in 1,000 homes in five major citiesby year-end and have a national sample of 2,000 homes by late1991. That will take an investment of $125 million, andArbitron will lose money on the service well into themid-1990s, says Kenneth Wollenberg, executive vice president.   Bristol-Myers Squibb has signed up, eager to match TVviewing to product purchases. The Nielsen people &quot;just aren'tmoving fast enough for our purposes,&quot; says Marianna Reges, amedia manager for Bristol-Myers's in-house advertising.   Still, many television executives doubt that two ratingsservices can survive. &quot;It would be like having two monetarysystems,&quot; says John Hunt, a vice president at ad agencyOgilvy andamp; Mather. If two suppliers turned in differentnumbers, it would raise conflicts as to which set was right.Yet if the numbers were the same, he says, why pay for twoservices?   Marshall Cohen, executive vice president at Viacom Inc.'sMTV Networks subsidiary, says the networks would abandon anew rival as soon as Nielsen's numbers got better. Theyblamed a loss of audience two years ago on Nielsen's switchto the people meter; a year later they cited the long strikeby script writers; now it's the people meter again. &quot;Nextyear,&quot; says Mr. Cohen, &quot;they'll blame it on the bossa nova.&quot;   But the networks say their complaints are legitimate andthat their desire for a new and better service is real. CBS'sMr. Poltrack says when he first got into the televisionbusiness, he couldn't believe billions of dollars were basedon so fragile a system as Nielsen's. &quot;I still can't believeit,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole thing is crazy.&quot;   ---            Nielsen Numbers: What to Believe?
