California Democrats Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Mel Levineblamed the Reagan administration for what they called a cover-upand asked Bush to review the oil leasing program.   ``The federal government refused to plan for a worst-case spillscenario in Alaska and the result is one of the nation's worstenvironmental disasters,'' Levine said. ``Now we learn thatgovernment tried to deliberately cover up information about spillsin California.''   Levine released internal memoranda from officials of Reagan'sInterior Department about the proposed lease sale in northernCalifornia in which warnings from the Fish and Wildlife Servicewere dismissed by the Minerals Management Service. Both agenciesare under the jurisdiction of then Secretary Donald Hodel, a Reaganappointee.   ``The material released today demonstrates the serious risks ofspills, the ineffectiveness of clean-up technology and otherenvironmental damage from lease sale 91 (in California), and thatthe Reagan administration tried to cover up that information,''said Levine.   A spokesman for Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, asked forcomment, said the new interior secretary has made it clear he wouldnot condone development unless it is ``environmentally prudent.''   Lujan is chairing a task force appointed by President Bush toreview the three California lease sales, including lease sale 91,scheduled for 1990. It will have its first meeting April 12. Noaction will be taken on the lease sales until the task force makesits report.   ``The task force might find that the lease sales should bestopped,'' said the spokesman, spoke on condition of anonymity.   Levine said warnings from the Fish and Wildlife Service aboutoffshore drilling risks in California were deleted from the finaldraft of a Minerals Management Service report last year.   He released a memo from Steven Griles, then assistant interiorsecretary in charge of offshore development, which said the fishand wildlife comments ``could prove very damaging to this leasesale.''   Several California newspapers last spring published storiesabout the disagreement between fish and wildlife and the mineralsmanagement. At the time, the Interior Department said the commentswere being deleted because they were irrelevant and containedcomments or opinions not supported by facts.   Among the deletions, Levine said, were warnings that tankertraffic is at high risk operating in rough seas, current technologycannot effectively clean up a spill, containment equipment is notdeployable in severe weather, and in calm weather it is only partlyeffective.   Levine also released a memo from the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration and one from the San Francisco office ofthe Environmental Protection Agency which said minerals managementwas playing down the environmental risks of an oil spill.   Richard Sanderson, director of the office of federal activitiesfor EPA in Washington, disputed Levine's contention that EPAheadquarters tried to water down environmental concerns about oilleasing.   He said that the EPA had strong environmental objections tolease sale 91 and gave it a rating so poor that it was nearly aveto.   As for the relationship between the California lease sales andwhat should have been known about the potential of a disaster inValdez, Sanderson said, ``That was 20 years ago.''   He said more is known now about the effects of oil spills thenwhen the environmental impact statements were made giving thego-ahead for oil transportation out of Prince William Sound.</TEXT></DOC>
