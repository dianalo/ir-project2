As Germany and some otherEuropean states understand, the West must recognize Sloveniaand Croatia in order to stop the war, to prevent the reversalof peaceful democratic change through military force, and tofacilitate a settlement based on the principle of democraticself-determination.   Some argue that, to paraphrase Neville Chamberlain,Croatia is a small, far away nation about which we knowlittle and should care less. But great stakes are involvedthat create the potential to transform today's small issueinto tomorrow's big issue. A neutral Western positionappeases the aggressors in Serbia and the Serbian-dominatedfederal army. It will give a green light to aggressorsworld-wide and send a discouraging signal to the world'sstruggling democrats, not only in the former Soviet Union buteven in China.</LP><TEXT>   We should not mourn the passing of artificialmultinational states, such as the Soviet Union andYugoslavia, that were held together by force under atotalitarian system. In Yugoslavia, civil war resulted fromthe actions of communist leaders in Belgrade who sought toperpetuate old-style centralized rule and not from those ofdemocratic forces in the republics who sought to decentralizepower. The Soviet Union will likely avoid a similar fatebecause the democrats in the republics, led by Boris Yeltsin,have prevailed politically over the unionists at the center,led by Mikhail Gorbachev.   The Yugoslav crisis is not the stereotypical Balkanstruggle between equally guilty parties in which benignneutrality is the best policy. In launching the offensiveagainst Croatia, the communist hardliners executed a de factocoup, seizing state power and defying the constitutionalorders of Yugoslavia's president, prime minister and four ofthe country's six republics. Serbian militias and the federalarmed forces have committed shocking atrocities againstcivilians, bombed the offices of the Croatian president,shelled cultural landmarks such as the medieval city ofDubrovnik, razed the major city of Vukovar, and are nowpoised to level the cities of Osijek and Vinkovci.   The West has accepted this communist &quot;fait accompli&quot;. Theidealistic mediation efforts of the European Community andthe United Nations have lacked the hardheaded realism neededto stop communist aggression. Even worse, the West engagedfor months in a tragic kind of moral equivalency by imposingan arms embargo and economic sanctions that treated theperpetrators and victims of aggression alike. Only recentlyhave some European states waived economic sanctions againstrepublics, like Croatia, that have complied with the mediatedcease-fires.   In the coming weeks, events in Yugoslavia will follow twopossible scenarios. Europe and the U.S. can end the war byrecognizing the independence of Slovenia and Croatia andadopting policies to create a balance of power on the ground.Or the West can stand by idly until communist forces commitfurther outrages on the battlefield that compel ourintervention after thousands more have died.   While we should not call Gen. Schwarzkopf out ofretirement or send in the Marines, we should do thefollowing:   -- First, we must grant full recognition to thegovernments of Slovenia and Croatia. In declaringindependence, the democratic governments of both republicswere exercising the right to secede set forth in the firstsentence of the Yugoslav constitution. Croatia has expresseda willingness to accept the European Community peace plan,but Serbia and the federal army have stonewalled everyproposed compromise. Diplomatic recognition would create apowerful deterrent to further aggression and a legalfoundation for later actions.   -- Second, we must introduce international peacekeepingforces even if a perfect cease-fire has not been established.The present policy of premising such a deployment on a totalhalt to hostilities gives the communist forces a veto overinternational action. As they have done after the 14cease-fires negotiated so far, they need only to restart theshooting, and international efforts go back to square one.Instead, well-armed U.N.- or European-sponsored peacekeepingforces should be deployed both at the current positions ofthe federal army and at Croatia's prewar borders, withsubsequent negotiations focusing on the withdrawal ofBelgrade's forces from occupied Croatian territory.   -- Third, we should provide Slovenia and Croatia withdefensive weapons. The U.N.-imposed arms embargo onYugoslavia has had the perverse effect of aiding thecommunist forces. The Serbia-dominated army has largemilitary stockpiles, and Yugoslavia's munitions factories,all of which are in Serbia, are working overtime. SomeYugoslav generals have boasted publicly that the embargoprimarily hurts the poorly armed Croatian militia and haveimplied that if Croatia acquires sufficient defensive weaponstheir army would be forced to make peace. It is time for theWest to supply Croatia with the mines, anti-tank weapons, andanti-aircraft missiles needed to compel the communists tocompromise at the negotiating table.   As Germany and other European states move towardrecognizing Slovenia and Croatia, the U.S. should not ride inthe caboose of the recognition train. In 1776, the Croatiancity-state of Dubrovnik became the first country to establishdiplomatic ties with the U.S. The Croatians had the courageof their convictions then. We should demonstrate the courageof our convictions now.   ---   Mr. Nixon is the author of &quot;Seize the Moment: America'sChallenge in a One-Superpower World,&quot; due out next month fromSimon andamp; Schuster.</TEXT></DOC>
