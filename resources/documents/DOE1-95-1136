Radiological protection asa discipline has to encompass events on a timescale that stretches fromless than a microsecond (when the interaction between radiation and biologicaltissues is being considered) to the next generation and beyond (whentrying to predict possible genetic effects). There is considerable knowledgeabout many of the processes involved although they are so numerous andcomplex that our understanding is likely to remain imperfect and incomplete.Nevertheless safety standards have been greatly improved by various nationaland international bodies so that the risks to workers and the generalpublic from the medical and industrial uses of radiation are now extremelylow and compare favourably with the accepted risks from many other environmentalhazards. Despite this, fear of radiation remains widespread and is difficultto assuage without sounding complacent.</TEXT></DOC>
