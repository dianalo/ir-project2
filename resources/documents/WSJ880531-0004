Late in the session, the U.S. currency traded at 1.7270 marks, up from 1.7215 marks early in the session and 1.7178 marks late Friday in New York.    The dollar showed a degree of strength in early trading Tuesday in Tokyo. At midmorning, it was quoted at 125.10 yen.    Dealers said the dollar traded back and forth throughout the day yesterday, hitting a Frankfurt intraday high of 1.7310 marks. They said its strength reflected continued upward momentum after the currency broke through a technical chart point at 1.7100 marks late Friday. During yesterday's trading, it overcame another hurdle when it passed 1.7280 marks.    A trader at a foreign bank in Frankfurt said the dollar could rise to 1.7350-1.7400 marks in the near term but warned that at those levels the market is likely to start taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the next batch of U.S. trade data, which will come out in mid-June.    Some traders also said there is little fundamental strength in the dollar and that the upward move could have been exaggerated by the thinness of the market. Markets were closed in Singapore, London and New York for national holidays.    At the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing, the dollar was set at 1.7264 marks, compared with 1.7127 marks Friday. It was the highest pricing since Oct. 30 of last year.    The West German central bank didn't intervene at the fixing, and traders said the bank wasn't active in the open foreign exchange market, either.    The dollar also rose in Tokyo, finishing higher than its New York close in relatively firm currency dealings.    Japanese exporters, buyers of the U.S. currency during the morning session, scaled down their activities by the afternoon because of the holiday in the U.S. &quot;It's not good to take positions ahead of a New York holiday,&quot; said one dealer for a large Japanese commercial bank. &quot;There won't be much happening until after New York re-opens,&quot; he said.    At the end of the Tokyo session, the dollar was quoted at 124.98 yen, up from 124.96 yen at the open and 124.93 yen late Friday in New York. It finished at 124.64 yen in Tokyo Friday.    Yesterday's firm, but somewhat subdued trading was described as a follow-up to the dollar's strength at the end of last week. Despite the U.S. currency's movements toward 125 yen, observers said the market isn't inclined to support the dollar above that level.    Foreign exchange traders and economists at international banks expect a steady to slightly firmer dollar over the next 30 days, a recent survey shows, but many expect the U.S. currency to weaken by the end of August.    Worries about what they see as a snail's-pace improvement in the U.S. current account deficit and dismay over Washington's inattention to its budget deficit will prevent the dollar from moving much higher, the AP-Dow Jones News Service survey was told. And the U.S. presidential election could begin to influence trading by the end of the summer, some of those surveyed said.    Also limiting the dollar's potential movement are fears that major central banks would intervene to halt it if the currency threatened to break out of either end of the broad trading ranges of 1.63 to 1.73 marks and 120 to 130 yen.    David Mulford, assistant U.S. Treasury secretary for international affairs, said Saturday night that the so-called Group of Seven major industrial countries will continue to cooperate closely in securing exchange rate stability and that they will take additional measures to reduce external imbalances.    Speaking at a Honolulu banquet marking the end of this year's world convention of senior foreign exchange dealers and analysts, Mr. Mulford said the G-7 nations &quot;have a common interest in stable exchange rates and are committed to implementing policies that strengthen the economic fundamentals to foster continued exchange rate stability.    &quot;Let me assure you also that close exchange market cooperation will continue,&quot; he added.    That position was backed up yesterday when French economics minister Pierre Beregovoy and West German finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg agreed that the dollar's current level is &quot;satisfactory.&quot; The two men were holding one of a regular series of meetings among French and German officials.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York on Friday, gold for June delivery settled at $450.80 an ounce, down $3.30. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $452.80 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                       Monday, May 30, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
