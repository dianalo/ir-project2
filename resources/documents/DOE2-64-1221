Since the investigation programme at the GTS is aimed atdeveloping methods and instrumentation and does not involve an actualsite assessment, the geology is investigated only in so far as this contributesto achieving these objectives and understanding the experiments. Specialaspects of water flow in the area are described in more details as mostof the experiments are affected directly or indirectly by water movementsin the rock. (author) 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
