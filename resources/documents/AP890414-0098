Opponents said the bill approved Thursday would not deter theuse of powerful weapons in crimes and could interfere with citizensand hunters.   And it could face opposition in the Senate, where the chairmanof the Judiciary Committee suggested an alternative that wouldrequire owners of assault rifles to register with police.   Several representatives said the legislation was a reaction tothe shooting deaths of five Stockton, Calif., schoolchildren inJanuary.   ``It's not a Stockton-related issue,'' said Democratic Rep.Nicholas Tsiongas. ``We have a very aggresive and violent societyand that's why we had problems with guns.''   ``I don't think it's going to deter crime,'' said Rep. MichaelZanni, also a Democrat. ``A number of these weapons that arementioned are very expensive hunting rifles.''   The House legislation passed 63-30 after nearly two hours ofdebate.   House members approved on a 70-18 vote a measure extending thewaiting period on handguns from 72 hours to one week andimplementing a one-week waiting period on shotguns and rifles.   A gun control bill is pending in the Senate, but no vote hasbeen planned.   Meanwhile, in Michigan, a bill was introduced in the Legislatureon Thursday to regulate the sale of semiautomatic weapons,including assault rifles.   The bill's sponsor, Sen. Nick Smith, a Republican, said it wouldkeep the weapons away from criminals while protecting the rights ofprivate citizens.   The measure drew support from the state sheriffs association,but was opposed by a representative of the National RifleAssociation.</TEXT></DOC>
