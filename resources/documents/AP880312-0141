Israel radio said close to 450 of the roughly 1,000 Arab policeofficers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip have quit theirjobs in the past two days and more resignations are expected.   Israeli and Palestinian officials said at least 330 had resignedand the resignations would take effect Monday.   Israeli bullets and beatings have killed 87 Palestinians inanti-occupation unrest since Dec. 8.   The resignations began Friday, one day after underground leadersof the disturbances in the occupied territories called on the Arabpolicemen to resign immediately. Some officers reported that theirlives had been threatened.   Israeli warplanes, meanwhile, struck at guerrilla targets eastof the port town of Sidon in southern Lebanon, the army commandsaid.   Israel television reported that at least eight people werekilled in the air raid, Israel's second this year againstPalestinian targets in south Lebanon. Sidon police said at leastone guerrilla was killed and eight were wounded.   In the West Bank, Israeli soldiers shot and seriously wounded aPalestinian from the village of Bani Naim, near Hebron, after hethrew a hand grenade at them, the army command said. The grenadedid not explode.   At Nur el-Shams, near Tulkarem, a 50-year-old woman was woundedwhen prison service employees opened fire after their bus wasstoned.   Thousands of Israeli Peace Now demonstrators gathered in TelAviv to urge Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to support a U.S. peaceinitiative that would allow limited self-rule for the Arabs in theoccupied lands.   Peace Now organizers estimated the crowd at 100,000. A reporterfor the daily Yediot Ahronot put the figure at 70,000. Policerefused to give an estimate.   Israel's right-wing factions have called for acounter-demonstration in the same place on Sunday evening, a fewhours before Shamir leaves for a visit to Washington to discuss theplan.   The continuing unrest in the occupied territories appears to beputting a severe strain on Israel's defense forces.   The weekend edition of Yediot Ahronot, the country's largestnewspaper, carried at least four ads offering security-related jobs.   One ad sought recruits for a new police anti-terror unit.Another asked for Arab-speaking officers holding the rank ofcaptain or major for ``special work involving contact with thelocal population.''   Other ads offered jobs to Arabic language translators alongIsrael's northern border and civilian guards to protect theIsraeli-Egyptian border.   The mass resignation of Palestinian police officers will add anew strain and could be the harbinger of larger and more seriousdefections to come.   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said the mass resignations ``willvastly affect the process of the courts in the West Bank, and it isa precedent for many more civil servants to resign.''   About 18,000 Palestinians work for the military government inthe West Bank and Gaza Strip.   National police spokesman Adi Gonen warned that the resignationswould hurt the Palestinians themselves.   ``The (Arab) police were not used for intelligence purposes, toput down protests or for anything political,'' said Gonen. ``Ifthey quit, we will have to reduce police activities and that willaffect the quality of Palestinian life.''   Last week, 40 Arab tax collectors in the Gaza Strip left theirjobs after Palestinian protesters threatened their lives.   The resignations indicated the growing loss of control by Israelover the occupied territories and deprived it of a potent symbol ofcooperation and coexistence with the Palestinians.   A survey by The Associated Press indicated that most of the 250policemen in the southern part of the West Bank have handed intheir resignations.   Arab police at the Ramallah station said all 50 policemen werequitting. Freij said that all 50 policemen in his district hadresigned. The Arab-run Palestine Press Service put the figure inHebron at at least 68.   Mordechai Bareket, police spokesman for the southern section ofthe occupied West Bank, said ``over 100 policemen'' handed in theirresignations over the past two days.   Israel radio reported that 100 policemen in Gaza and 30 in thenorthern district of the West Bank also said they were leaving theforce.   Police spokesmen said they were trying to persuade thePalestinian police officers to change their minds.   ``We are talking to each one of them individually and lookinginto each of their problems,'' said Chaim Alter, commander of thenorthern West Bank police district.   The order to resign was issued Thursday by the National UnitedCommand of the Uprising.   Mustafa Adani, who resigned Friday, said his life had beenthreatened twice.   Earlier this week, a policeman from the Aqbat Jaber refugee campnear Jericho was killed.</TEXT></DOC>
