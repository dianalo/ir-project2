We found it in our clips fromthe summer of 1984, two presidential landslides ago. Yet thesame issue has the Republican Party paralyzed today oneconomic policy; tax cuts to spur economic growth arederailed by the accusation that they would hurt the poor, orat least help the rich.   Democrats charge that Reagan administration policies madethe rich richer and the poor poorer. This charge has carriedthe day because the Bush administration has offered norebuttal, but a few congressional Republicans are starting toshow some spunk. Senators Domenici and Gramm have offered ananalysis demonstrating that the poor benefited along with theprosperous during the seven-year economic expansion startingin 1983. Democrats reply that the choice of year loads thedice, and that since they last held the presidency in 1980the income distribution has become more lopsided.</LP><TEXT>   In our own view, anyone seriously interested in thestatistics behind this battle should start with the CensusBureau reports, the most relevant extracts of which arereprinted alongside (see related story: &quot;The `Fairness Issue'Explained&quot; -- WSJ March 15, 1991). Yes, by the usual measuresthe income distribution did become more unequal during the1980s, as for that matter it did during the 1970s. Thefigures are not dramatic, which is to be expected given theremarkable stability of such measures over time and acrosssocieties.   More important, what seems primarily to be happening isless a matter of public policy than of sweeping demographicchange. To understand, note the caveat &quot;the usual measures.&quot;The usual measure is pre-tax money income of households. Soby definition tax changes such as the Reagan cuts have nodirect effect. Money income excludes in-kind transfers to thepoor, including food stamps, which look and work a lot likemoney. And households include both families and individualsliving alone.   A banker's son leaving home to go to graduate school wouldleave the top 20% and join the bottom 20%, presumablytemporarily. Someone retiring to live on savings couldcollect $15,000 in interest and/or Social Security and stillbe in the bottom 20%. Female-headed households are especiallylikely to be in the bottom 20%. So if you have fewer peopleper household, if you have more retired people, if you havemore female-headed households, the usual statistics will showgrowing income inequality, even if income per capitaincreases handsomely and the population is quite generallymore prosperous. As the Census Bureau elaborates, this isprecisely what happened over the past two decades andparticularly in the 1980s.   So in themselves the income-distribution numbers tell usvery little about the welfare of the bottom 20%, let aloneabout the impact of public policy. In trying to develop ayardstick including the impact of taxes and all transferpayments, for example, the Census Bureau found that thedistribution was not affected by including the rental valueof owner-occupied housing, because &quot;homeowners are spreadthroughout the income distribution.&quot; As Heritage analystRobert Rector has reported on this page, the Census numbersshow that some 22,000 &quot;poor&quot; households own heated swimmingpools or Jacuzzis. The Census also measures the consumptionof households below the poverty line, and finds it runsnearly twice the measured income. Whatever you make of thesestatistics, it's far from clear they represent an indictmentof American society.   Nor are they a portrait of a decade of greed. Whileself-evidently a partisan reply to partisan attacks, theDomenici-Gramm analysis makes one cardinal point: Once we gotthe tide rising, it did indeed lift all boats. One can argueabout when to start the count, or about what causes recessionand what causes boom, but there is no argument about theunderlying statistics. They refute rather than support theassertion that during the seven-year Reagan expansion therich prospered at the expense of the poor.   Do the champions of &quot;fairness&quot; really doubt that a growingeconomy is better for the poor than a shrinking one? Wouldthey prefer to live in a society with a shrinking economy anda flattening distribution of income, or in a society withincreasing disparities in the income measures but growing percapita income? Do they really think this kind of &quot;fairness&quot;is politically invincible? As the two presidential landslidesshow, the fairness issue is no match for the growth issue.The fairness issue has arisen only because the Republicanshave more or less abandoned the growth issue, choosinginstead to emphasize their futile attempt to close thedeficit in a budget deal with the Democrats. The most hopefulthing about the Domenici-Gramm initiative is that it suggeststhe Republicans may yet return to their good senses.   One final point on &quot;the poor.&quot; We do not need incomestatistics to see that our society includes real people withreal problems. The homeless are manifest. Our schools inurban centers are performing poorly. We have a drug problem.We have a crime problem. We should help those suffering fromthese problems. We should become less permissive toward thementally ill. We should let &quot;the poor&quot; choose their ownschools. We should do everything we can to stigmatize drugs.We should make the criminal-justice system work, inparticular by allowing juries access to evidence. It is noaccident that those who resist these steps are preciselythose who find the lodestone of &quot;fairness&quot; in the pre-taxmoney income of households.</TEXT></DOC>
