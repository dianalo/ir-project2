Hundreds of students, some of whom had led recentanti-government demonstrations in Burma, gathered on a large, openfield at this Karen camp as Gen. Bo Mya, spoke to Thai and foreigncorrespondents.   Some Burmese Buddhist monks were also present.   Bo Mya said the Karens would allow the students to set upindependently run camps where the rebels would provide militarytraining and arm the students for a war against the military-rungovernment in Rangoon.   Two small groups of students reportedly have already been givenrudimentary training and have slipped back into Rangoon, wherehardline Gen. Saw Maung staged a military coup Sept. 18 andruthlessly put down pro-democracy protests.   ``Now, the students are urgently in need of internationalassistance for the success of their movement,'' said a statementfrom the Karen National Union.   He said his rebel group presumed the international communityrealized the rebels had insufficient weapons and ammunition of itsown.   Bo Mya said he has received no response to letters sent to theUnited States, Japan, Great Britain and other governmentsdescribing brutal conditions in Burma and urging them to halt allaid to Rangoon.   The rebels, who have fought the central government for fourdecades, said nearly 3,500 people had sought refuge inKaren-controlled areas along the Thai-Burmese border, including1,545 at his base about one mile from the Thai frontier.   ``The persecution, killing and hostile searches are still goingon in Rangoon and other cities. We believe many more will becoming,'' Bo Mya said.   By official count, about 425 persons have been killed since theSept. 18 coup. Western diplomats and opposition figures saycasualties were far higher, while several thousand are reliablybelieve to have died as the military put down earlierdemonstrations.   Student leader Winn Moe, who also appealed for foreign aid, saidthe students expected many more colleagues to join them onceindependent, functioning camps were set up.   ``We will try our best to see that they (students) will have thebest privileges we can offer but we are not rich revolutionariesand we do not have enough ourselves,'' Bo Mya said.   Karen spokesman Em Marta said some problems had already surfacedamong the students, who have formed an All Burma Federation ofStudent Unions. These included leadership disputes and factionalism.   ``They are young, enthusiastic and very impatient. We cannotfight our enemy with that,'' Em Marta said.   This base is located 43 miles south of the key Thai border townof Mae Sot and several days' walk from Rangoon to the west.   The Karens rose up against the central government in 1949 sayingthat earlier promises of considerable autonomy had been broken.Since then, a dozen ethnic minority groups have also taken uy armsagainst Rangoon and together control large areas along theThai-Burmese border.   Ten of the rebel groups, including the Karens, are bandedtogether in a loose National Democratic Front, which claims tofield 35,000 guerrillas. The Karen National Union says it has17,000 soldiers who are widely regarded as good jungle fighters.</TEXT></DOC>
