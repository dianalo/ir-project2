Hopkins, Minn.-based Venturian, which distributes military parts and equipment in the U.S. and abroad, said the grand-jury subpoenas were served Sept. 21. The company said it turned over documents to federal investigators and spent $384,000 on attorneys fees in 1987 in connection with the inquiry.    The company said the subpoenas ordered a &quot;a number of present and former officers and employees&quot; to appear before the grand jury and that several employees have testified.    Gary B. Rappaport, Venturian president, said the grand jury is looking into &quot;general business affairs&quot; of the company. He declined to elaborate, but said the investigation is still going on. In a statement, Venturian said it couldn't predict the scope of the inquiry or its outcome.    Jerome Arnold, the U.S. attorney in Minneapolis, declined yesterday to say whether a grand-jury investigation of the company is under way.    Venturian sells mostly military vehicle and aircraft parts and communications equipment. Mr. Rappaport said most of the company's sales are to foreign customers.    The company yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of $165,000, or 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of $2 million a year ago. It had sales of $10 million for the period, up 5.3% from previous-year sales of $9.5 million.    For 1987, Venturian had net of $886,000, or 89 cents a share, compared with a 1986 loss of $1.6 million. It had sales of $32.9 million, down 9.9% from year-earlier sales of $36.5 million.    The 1986 fourth-quarter and year figures reflect a $2.8 million charge for an asset write-down in connection with a planned leveraged buy-out of its international marketing subsidiary, Napco International Inc. Mr. Rappaport said the decision to sell Napco was dropped after an increase in the unit's orders, resulting in a one-time gain in 1987 of $994,000.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Venturian was unchanged at $12.50 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
