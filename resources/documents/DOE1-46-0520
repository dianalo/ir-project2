The data in thisarticle were obtained in an industrial hygiene survey conducted undera cooperative agreement between NIOSH and the New Jersey State HealthDepartment. The author had an opportunity to review these data priorto the publication in the NIOSH Heath Hazard Evaluation Report and believesthat there may be another explanation for the results observed ratherthan the postulated electrostatic effects. This explanation involvesthe biases that can occur at various filter loadings as well as the expectedelectrostatic interaction between the sampled dust particles and thecassette.</TEXT></DOC>
