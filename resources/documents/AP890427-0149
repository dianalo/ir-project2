The military fired back with long-range missiles into thesurrounding mountains where the insurgents are hiding.   The guerrillas issued a statment from their Peshawar, Pakistan,headquarters describing the 1978 revolution as ``the beginning ofmore than a decade-long nightmare.''   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said Iran-based guerrillasand Afghan refugees marched in Tehran to protest the communist coup.   Hundreds of Afghan refugees in New Delhi also marched and burnedan effigy of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whosegovernment backs the Afghan leadership.   ``Long live Afghanistan! Down with Russia! Down withcommunism!'' they shouted while marching near Parliament.   In a speech to diplomats and visiting delegations, PresidentNajib said the army has proved it can defend Afghanistan withoutthe help of Soviet troops, who completed their withdrawal from thecountry Feb. 15.   ``The enemies had set a deadline of two or three weeks after thewithdrawal for occupying Kabul,'' Najib said. ``You can see that... the armed forces have created an unsurmountable barrier beforethe aggressors.''   As he spoke to 1,500 people at the presidential palace, rocketsand explosions could be heard outside.   Fifteen rockets hit Kabul starting at sunrise.   One landed in the central square, where a day earlier thegovernment celebrated the anniversary with a military parade. Theparade was held a day before the actual anniversary because offears of attacks.   There had been speculation for weeks the guerrillas would send avolley of rockets into the city of 2.25 million people Thursday.   The dead included two soldiers and a member of the localsecurity forces. One rocket killed two women, injured two childrenand a man, and destroyed three mud-and-stone houses, militaryofficials said.   About half a mile away, another woman died and a child had hislegs blown off when a rocket slammed into their house, theofficials said on condition of anonymity.   This year's observance of the Saur, or April revolution, wassubdued. Most businesses closed and there were few people orvehicles in the streets, which were lined with the black, red andgreen Afghan flag, and the red flag of the ruling People'sDemocratic Party.   The Moslem insurgency began after the coup that ousted PresidentMohammed Daoud on April 27, 1978. More than 1 million people havedied in the fighting and 5 million Afghans _ about one-third of thecountry's population _ fled to neighboring Pakistan and Iran.   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,replaced one communist government with another and stayed to helpfight the insurgents, known as mujahedeen or Islamic holy warriors.   Najib became president in May 1986. On May 15, 1988, the RedArmy began leaving Afghanistan under a U.N.-sponsored accord.</TEXT></DOC>
