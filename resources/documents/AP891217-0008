AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. soldier was fatally shotSaturday night as he and three other American servicemen tried toflee a crowd of Panamanian troopers and civilians, a U.S. SouthernCommand spokesman reported.   The Panamanian Defense Forces said Sunday that the U.S.servicemen had fired several shots at the military headquarters ofGen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, wounding three Panamanians, includinga soldier and a 1-year-old girl. U.S. officials said the Americanswere unarmed.   U.S. and Panamanian troops went on alert after the incident, themost serious in a series of confrontations between the two forces.American troops in battle gear could be seen around Fort Clayton,and tanks were heading toward the base. Several unidentifiedhelicopters flew over the city shortly after midnight.   A U.S. spokesman, Col. Ronald Sconyers, said four off-dutyAmerican soldiers in civilian clothes were stopped by about 40civilians and five Defense Forces troopers as they were driving bymilitary headquarters.   The spokesman said the crowd tried to pull the Americans out ofthe car, and as the U.S. soldiers drove off shots were fired at thecar, wounding one of the Americans. He said the other U.S.servicemen were not injured.   The wounded American was taken to the U.S. military's GorgasHospital where he died, Sconyers said. He did not identify thevictim pending notification of his relatives.   The Defense Forces made no mention of the American casualty in astatement issued at 4 a.m. Sunday.   It said a car with U.S. license plates broke throughcheckpoints, drove past the Defense Headquarters and fired severalshots at it, wounding three Panamanians. The 1-year-old, ElinBethancourt, was wounded in the left arm, the Defense Forces said.   Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, the duty officer at the time, calledthe incident ``a provocation against the life and property of ourpeople.''   Civilians said Panamanian troopers condoned off the areasurrounding the Defense Forces headquarters.   The television channel of the U.S. Southern Command announcedthat a ``Delta'' alert was in effect, restricting U.S. militarypersonnel to their bases. That alert was ordered during the Octoberrevolt by a small group of Defense Forces personnel.   Since May, there have been several confrontations betweenPanamanian and U.S. forces in Panama that included shoutingmatches, but no shooting.   A Noriega-organized paramilitary force, the Dignity Battalions,have demonstrated and tried to block recent U.S. maneuvers. In arecent letter, the U.S. high command told the Panamanian militarythat any action against U.S. personnel would be considered anaction by the Defense Forces.   A government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidNoriega, who was declared Panama's chief of government Friday, wasin the western province of Chiriqui late Saturday.   In appointing Noriega chief executive, the rubber-stamplegislature said the action was necessary because Panama was in a``state of war'' with the United States. It based the state-of-wardeclaration on severe ecnomic sanctions imposed on Panama in aneffort to force Noriega to step down.   Noriega had been Panama's de facto ruler as Defense Forces chief.   The general, who is under indictment on drug-trafficking chargesin the United States, thwarted an Oct. 3 coup attempt when loyaltroops came to his support after he was trapped and held hostage bythe rebels for several hours.   At least 10 of the rebellious officers and soldiers who launchedthe October coup were killed, either in fighting or after theysurrendered.   Noriega has denied the U.S. drug charges and says Washington'sefforts to oust him are an attempt to avoid complying with the 1977Panama Canal Treaties. The accords turn the waterway over to Panamaat the end of the century.   After the October coup he claimed the United States was behindthe revolt, but Washington denied that. Some of the 12,000 Americantroops stationed in Panama had blocked streets near Defense Forcesheadquarters but they did not become engaged in the conflict.</TEXT></DOC>
