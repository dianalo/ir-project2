Kennedy andamp; Co., a San Francisco-based investment firm, said it boosted its stake in Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.'s common shares to 10.1% from about 8%.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Kennedy said it bought its Cleveland-Cliffs stock for investment purposes. But the brokerage firm also expressed concern in the filing about whether Cleveland-Cliffs will maximize shareholder value in connection with its proposals to sell a 93% interest in Upper Peninsula Generating Co., a power plant in Marquette, Mich., and to increase the number of its authorized common shares.    In Cleveland, a spokesman for the iron ore, coal and lumber concern said executives were studying the filing. &quot;As to what it means, we don't know,&quot; he said. Responding to the concerns voiced by Kennedy in the filing, the spokesman added, &quot;We're trying to ascertain what that means.&quot;    In San Francisco, Kennedy officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Kennedy's stake includes 137,600 shares purchased from March 9 through last Thursday at $10.375 to $13.50 a share and assumes that the brokerage firm converts 59,700 shares of preferred stock it holds into 49,730 common shares, the filing said.    Kennedy said in the filing that it currently owns the equivalent of 1,258,930 of Cleveland-Cliffs's 12.4 million shares outstanding.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Cleveland-Cliffs shares rose 75 cents to close at $14.875. </TEXT></DOC>
