The scarcity of investmentcapital, inherent risks in the mining industry and the need to generatelarge investable surplus through attainment of high levels of productionand productivity have made decision making somewhat complex and clearguidelines for the choice of the level of mechanisation are lacking.While the coal industry in the West is going forward on a closely integratedpolicy of automation and mechanisation, the coal industry in many developingcountries has to resolve this dilemma as yet the experiences with transferof technology and specially of capacity utilisation have been none toosatisfactory. The paper sets out to examine in depth the criteria forthe choice of technology and appropriate level of mechanisation in theperspective of the Indian coal industry which has undergone massive developmentsince nationalisation in 1972-73. Experiences of underground coal facemechanisation in the past two decades are synthesised and case historiesanalysed for two high-investment mines, one in Jharia Coalfield and theother in Korba Coalfield. The anatomy of investment decisions vis-a-vislevel of mechanisation is discussed and the directions for future mechanisationlevels charted. 9 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
