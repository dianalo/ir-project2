The tape, which graphically depicted the disaster caused whenthe tanker struck Bligh Reef last March 24, was introduced inevidence by the prosecution.   Daniel Lawn, an environmental engineer with Alaska's Departmentof Environmental Conservation, testified that he shot the footageafter he was summoned by the Coast Guard to visit the stricken shipand record details of the nation's worst oil spill.   He called the tape ``mental note-taking,'' explaining how heaccompanied Coast Guard investigators to the 987-foot ship.   The tape, which lasted about 10 minutes, first showed the shipsitting in the darkness, its lights glowing. The video thenswitched to a period after dawn, when the ship's deck was morevisible and a contrast was shown between the gooey black oil on oneside of the tanker and the clear blue water on the other.   Also visible were chunks of ice which the vessel had sought toelude in its course into Prince William Sound.   Long narrated the tape, showingwhich tanks were leaking oil,saying at one point: ``You can see it bubbling out.''   The tape was offered as prosecutors began a final barrage ofevidence aimed at proving that Hazelwood, skipper of the ship, wasdrunk and reckless the night the tanker went aground.   After two weeks of testimony from 23 witnesses, assistantdistrict attorneys Brent Cole and Mary Ann Henry plan to concludetheir case late this week or early next.   On Friday, Coast Guard Investigator Mark Delozier told ofboarding the grounded tanker in the early morning hours of March 24and confronting Hazelwood, who smelled of liquor. He said the smellwas ``very intense and very obvious.''   Delozier also testified that in the captain's quarters he foundtwo empty cans of a low-alcohol beer. He said there were more cansof the beer in a refrigerator.   The defense may cite the presence of the beer to explain whyHazelwood tested positive on a blood-alcohol test administered 10{hours after the Exxon Valdez grounding and some 15 hours after hewas seen at a bar in Valdez. The blood test showed Hazelwood had ablood alcohol level of .061, under the limit for driving in Alaskabut above the federal limit for operating a commercial vessel.   The 43-year-old skipper is charged with second degree criminalmischief, a felony, and three misdemeanors, reckless endangerment,operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge ofoil. If convicted, his maximum penalties could be 7\ years inprison plus $61,000 in fines.   The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, ran aground on jagged BlighReef, gashing holes in its oil tanks and spilling almost 11 milliongallons of oil into the clear waters of Prince William Sound.   The spill was the nation's largest, killing countless birds,fish and wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of rocky shore.   Delozier's testimony focused on the much-debated question ofwhether Hazelwood was drunk at the time of the accident. Testimonyhas been inconclusive on how many drinks Hazelwood had during anafternoon in the town of Valdez before the ship sailed.   Ship's officers who accompanied him say he had two or threedrinks over a period of about three hours. The prosecutionmaintains he was in a bar for about six hours and kept orderingvodka on the rocks.   The only point on which all witnesses seem to agree is thatHazelwood never appeared to be drunk on the Exxon Valdez. EvenDelozier, who smelled alcohol on him, said he did not stagger, slurhis words or appear impaired by alcohol.   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone was considering aprosecution proposal to call as witnesses experts who claim theycan tell from listening to tape recordings of a person's voicewhether they are intoxicated. Prosecutors want the experts to givetheir opinions about Hazelwood from listening to the tape of theskipper reporting the Exxon Valdez grounding to the U.S. CoastGuard.</TEXT></DOC>
