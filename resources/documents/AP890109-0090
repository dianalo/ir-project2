The federal government should also depend more on the privatesector to provide ancillary and support services for activities thatremain in federal hands.   Therefore, I propose a number of pilot projects and studies inareas such as the private delivery of advertising materials andurgent mail, and the Department of Justice's prison hospitals.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>Improved Management</NOTE><TEXT>   In 1981, I made a promise to the American people ``to limitgovernment to its proper role and make it the servant, not themaster, of the people.''   My ``Management Improvement Program: Reform '88'' has helped makegovernment more efficient and more responsive.   We reduced waste and fraud in federal programs by combining theefforts of the inspectors general into the President's Council onIntegrity and Efficiency, resulting in over $110 billion saved orput to better use _ and their efforts are continuing.   I saw that the federal government did not have effective cashmanagement practices for dealing with what is now a $2 trillionannual cash flow, nor did it have a governmentwide credit managementprogram for what is now a $1 trillion portfolio.   This resulted in the waste of billions of dollars each year.   We built the necessary governmentwide controls in both areas andstopped the drain.   Moreover, we began the establishment of the first governmentwidefinancial accounting system, consolidating and making uniform over400 previously incompatible individual agency systems.   This was essential for any well-managed government, and ispresently being implemented.   The federal government has a major effect on our daily livesthrough the collection of taxes and fees, the direct provisions ofservices, the payment of financial assistance through variousentitlement programs, and the regulation of commercial enterprises.   Through modernization, improved administration, and automatedservices the government has made substantial reductions in the timeit takes to provide services to the public.   As the 21st century approaches, the federal government must adaptits role in our society to changing conditions and changingtechnology.   At the turn of the century, the U.S. population will exceed 268million, with a larger proportion of elderly citizens.   Changes in technology and communication will increasingly linkthe world's economies, trade, capital flows, and travel as neverbefore.</TEXT><HEAD>MORE</HEAD><TEXT/></DOC>
