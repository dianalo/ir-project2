Sometimes it seems top executives get as much air time and ink these days as rock stars.    But will that fame endure? Which leaders of corporate America will live in memory like the Beatles or Elvis? Which will vanish like Moby Grape or Marianne Faithfull?    Business history is studded with figures of enduring fame. Henry Ford turned the automobile into an empire. John D. Rockefeller created the first oil trusts. Alfred Sloan shaped the idea of a modern corporation. Andrew Carnegie made his fortune in steel and devoted his life to philanthropy. Villains aren't in short supply, either -- railway magnate Jay Gould caused the &quot;Black Friday&quot; panic with his speculation in gold.    But trying to identify the Henry Fords, Alfred Sloans or Jay Goulds of the 1980s isn't easy. In search of answers, we made an unscientific and impressionistic survey, asking management professors, business historians, financial journalists and management consultants which chief executives will be remembered.    What chief executives do they think MBAs of the class of 2037 will study? Who will future managers admire and emulate? Or excoriate? What emerges is a list of men who, in the eyes of these observers, have had an impact beyond their own corporations and industries.    The list is short. While these observers find many chief executives praiseworthy, they predict few will be remembered.    Here then are the contemporary executives business observers believe will still be talked about after the 21st century rolls around.    -- The Leaders   Walter Wriston is the only consistent nominee. &quot;He belongs on anybody's list,&quot; says Thomas Horton, president of the American Management Association, a nonprofit group.    A champion of deregulation, Mr. Wriston will be remembered for his role in moving the staid banking industry into more complex financial services, those surveyed predict. At Citicorp, where Mr. Wriston was chairman through August 1984, he moved the bank holding company from concentrating on corporate lending into consumer banking.    The choice of Mr. Wriston reflects observers' feelings that to be remembered, one has to change more than just a company. &quot;He did more to change the banking system than anyone else,&quot; says Mr. Horton.    Mr. Wriston also is first choice because of his role as business statesman. &quot;He's extraordinarily literate, persuasive and forceful,&quot; says John Jeuck, professor of business history at the University of Chicago's business school. &quot;Clearly he's one of the handful of industrial statesmen of this generation.&quot;    Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca is often mentioned too, but for mixed reasons. Some think he will be remembered for his role in getting government loan guarantees to help bail out Chrysler. &quot;He not only turned around a company headed out of existence, but tended to take a stronger position on the appropriate role for government in helping out industry,&quot; says David Lewin, professor at Columbia University's business school.    Others think Mr. Iacocca will be remembered for his personality and his role in popularizing business. &quot;He turned the faceless CEO into a cult figure,&quot; says management consultant Thomas J. Peters, co-author of the book &quot;In Search of Excellence.&quot;    But Mr. Iacocca may be remembered less than the social and political forces that surrounded him, many say. &quot;The real book on Iacocca isn't written yet,&quot; says Paul Tiffany, a business historian at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. &quot;What saved Chrysler was a thing called quotas.&quot;    Edward Bowman, professor of management at Wharton, says, &quot;Iacocca could be in some professor's textbook 50 years from now as an example of government-business involvement. Maybe as a footnote.&quot;    To many, this is the era of the entrepreneur. They believe that the people who will be remembered are those who, like Henry Ford, Montgomery Ward or Harvey Firestone, built companies from scratch. Frederick Smith at Federal Express Corp. is a popular choice. &quot;He represents the epitome of entrepreneurship,&quot; says Jim Farley, senior chairman of the consulting firm Booz, Allen andamp; Hamilton Inc. &quot;History will remember Federal Express and that a guy had an idea and (made it work) against imposing odds. He created a new form of distribution.&quot;    The importance of a new industry will underscore the importance of the indvidual, says James Brian Quinn, a professor of management at the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College. &quot;When you stand in the year 2000, and look back on three decades, the technology that will stand out . . . will be biotechnology.&quot;    &quot;Bob Swanson is the single most prominent name as a CEO in that business,&quot; Mr. Quinn says. Robert Swanson, Genentech Inc.'s founder and chief executive, turned Genentech into a major drug maker, with such products as genetically engineered insulin and the experimental drug Interferon.    Computers changed the world, too, but many feel that even the best known computer entrepreneurs, such as Steven P. Jobs, former chairman of Apple Computer Inc., will be forgotten. &quot;Jobs won't be remembered,&quot; says Edward Bowman of Wharton. &quot;He's a flash in the pan.&quot;    Others think Mr. Jobs will be remembered as a symbol of a new executive type. &quot;Steve Jobs won't be forgotten,&quot; says Harold J. Leavitt, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University and author of &quot;Corporate Pathfinders.&quot; &quot;He's the children's crusader, a young man with contemporary values and young attitudes. He's a kind of a cult leader.&quot;    Some say the real guiding lights aren't known yet. &quot;We are waiting for the second Sloan, but he won't appear in an industrial company,&quot; maintains J.P. Donlon, editor of Chief Executive magazine. &quot;He will appear in a service industry.&quot;    -- The Dismantlers   Many contend that the 1980s will be known for mergers and acquisitions, and corporate raiders such as Saul Steinberg, Carl Icahn and T. Boone Pickens will be remembered. &quot;These people are the ones who will be recalled 40 or 50 years from now as the robber barons of old,&quot; says Mr. Tiffany, the business historian.    Mr. Jeuck of the University of Chicago compares the rash of mergers and acquisitions of the 1980s with the turmoil of late 19th century American business -- in reverse.    &quot;At the end of the 19th century there was a whole epidemic of trust-building and pyramiding of trusts and holding companies, and the whole Rockefeller-Jay Gould era of consolidation of American industry,&quot; he says. &quot;This is in a different direction. It's a disintegration process.&quot;    -- Rogues   In business as elsewhere, there's more than one way to acquire a lasting reputation. &quot;I picked DeLorean because he was an entrepreneur with a lot of flair,&quot; says Stanford's Mr. Leavitt. He notes that John Z. DeLorean's bid for enduring fame got some unwanted boosts: &quot;Being arrested will help. Anything that gets (people) into the media will help.&quot; Mr. DeLorean, whose automobile company went into receivership in 1982, was acquitted of cocaine smuggling charges and later acquitted of charges that he diverted company funds for his own use.    Many agree that a brush with the law can win a place in history. So for Wharton's Mr. Bowman, a candidate for lasting fame is Ivan Boesky. He believes Mr. Boesky's agreement to pay $100 million in settlement of insider trading charges will survive in memory after the less-sullied reputations of others have faded.    Theodore Levitt, editor of the Harvard Business Review, says, &quot;The things that are remembered are things of rascality and notoriety because they become metaphors and symbols,&quot; and he predicts that our age one day will be called &quot;the Boesky era.&quot;    -- Outsiders   Our survey specified chief executives of American corporations. But some experts said they wouldn't play unless we changed the rules. To them, the business leaders Americans are most likely to remember are Japanese.    &quot;What do you do when they are producing in the U.S.?&quot; asks David Lewin, professor of business at Columbia's business school. He nominates Akio Morita, chairman and chief executive at Sony Corp., which has five manufacturing plants in the U.S. In a new, multinational environment, says Mr. Lewin, top business leaders are top business leaders wherever you find them. &quot;These are pace-setting companies. We are learning lessons from those abroad.&quot;    Mr. Quinn at Amos Tuck says, &quot;The guy who deserves world mention and will clearly be recognized by his country and by the world is Konosuke Matsushita, who founded Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.&quot; He adds: &quot;When you hear Japanese mangement style referred to, very often the model is Matsushita.&quot;    -- Nobody   &quot;I'll be damned if I can come up with anybody,&quot; says John Gallagher, senior lecturer in business policy at the University of Chicago's business school.    It's not that he didn't try: Mr. Gallagher questioned two classes of students, totaling 110 people, and circulated the question informally at &quot;three or four&quot; meetings of boards he sits on. &quot;Everyone says 'Duh . . .'&quot; he reports.    The key, he says, is the anonymity of corporate work. The people who are remembered are founders, the people who have their names on the door. Today corporations are bureaucratic, he says. Even entrepreneurs are surrounded by a crowd of venture capitalists, investment bankers and regulators.    &quot;Since Thomas Watson Jr., IBM has been run by a sea of faceless people,&quot; he says. &quot;I couldn't give you the name of the current president of Xerox or IBM if my life depended on it. (Steven) Jobs . . . (is) hardly known now, much less 50 years from now. Will Roger Smith be famous 50 years from now? Hell, no.&quot;    Management expert Peter Drucker agrees: &quot;Chief executives . . . are rarely remembered and rarely worth remembering. They are servants.&quot;    ---   Ms. Bennett reports on management from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---                      Heroes of the CEOs   The Wall Street Journal survey on executive style askedCEOs to name their business heroes.
