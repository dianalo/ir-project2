The grenades fired by both sides flattened houses inPaynesville, a suburb eight miles northeast of Monrovia, accordingto reports from travelers to the area.   Rebels began some of Saturday's fighting, but most clashes werestarted by troops loyal to President Samuel Doe, the witnessessaid. He is trying to stall a drive against the capital by theinsurgent National Patriotic Front of Liberia.   Diplomats said there had been no major gains by either side andthe military situation appeared to be static. The rebels encircledthe city after beginning their offensive from the far northeastcorner of this West African nation six months earlier.   Diplomatic sources said there were persistent reports offighting between rival groups of rebels. The diplomats, speaking oncondition of anonymity, suggested this might have been one reasonfor the delay in the assault on Monrovia.   Rebel leader Charles Taylor acknowledged a split as long ago asMay, saying one of the senior rebel leaders, Prince Johnson, hadsummarily executed rebel commanders without trial.   This besieged Atlantic coast capital, virtually cut off from theoutside world by land, sea and air, was again without power andpiped water supplies Saturday. A municipal generator that had beenshut down for a week restored electrical power from Friday eveningto Saturday morning and then shut down again.   There was no explanation for the renewed outage, but thegenerator was powered by diesel fuel, which is in short supply.   Several aid groups, including the International Committee of theRed Cross, Doctors Without Borders, and Catholic Relief Services,have begun distributing rice to residents who have been eatingroots and leaves because of food shortages.   The rice had been stored since June in warehouses where it wasdeposited by the United Nations. U.N. staff members were pulled outof Liberia after refugees housed in their compound were attacked bysome of Doe's troops.   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said about eight maskedsoldiers killed a guard and abducted about 30 people.   One of the U.N. warehouses was looted by Doe's soldiers, but asecond was opened to the relief agencies. They distributed itscontents to the needy while the government provided protection.   Checkpoints, created throughout the city as the governmentdefensive position has deteriorated, were more relaxed on Saturday.Soldiers waved some travelers through without inspection.   The guerrillas accuse Doe's government of corruption, tribalismand suppressing the opposition. They have said they will lay downtheir arms only after Doe leaves office.   Negotiations in neighboring Sierra Leone have failed to end theconflict.   Doe took power in a 1980 coup that ousted elitist descendants ofAmerican slaves who founded Liberia in 1847.</TEXT></DOC>
