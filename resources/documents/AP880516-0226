A company official said the Pride of Kent left Dover at 10:45a.m. (5:45 a.m. EDT) on an unscheduled sailing and returned atabout 2 p.m.   ``It is another step in the progressive reintroduction of ourservices and ships,'' said a P and O spokesman, who was notidentified in line with British custom. He acknowledged that ``notmany people'' were on board.   Another P and O official, also speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the company intended to resume normal passengersailings on the Dover-Calais run, the busy and shortest routebetween England and the Continent. He said the company wouldprovide three round-trip sailings daily.   P and O made its first effort to break the strike with sailingsbetween Dover and Zeebrugge, Belgium, beginning May 1. Its ferriescarried mainly freight and a few passengers.   It began operating freight ferries between Dover and Calais onFriday.   Rival ferry companies resumed full operations Friday aftermembers of the National Union of Seamen decided to give up theirsecondary action in support of P and O's striking workers.   The P and O strikers are protesting changes in work schedulesthat the company is instituting as cost-cutting measures. P and Osaid the measures are needed to make the line competitive by thetime the Channel Tunnel opens in 1993, providing a directrailroad-car route between Britain and France.</TEXT></DOC>
