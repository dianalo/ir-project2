Granma, the official daily newspaper of the Communistgovernment, said the effectiveness of the interference devices``has been partly proven.''   The United States has been broadcasting radio transmissions toCuba via Radio Marti for five years. Congress backed funds fortelevision broadcasts earlier this year.   In a joint statement published in Granma, Cuba's CommunicationsMinistry, armed forces and Radio and Television Institute said theCuban plan was prompted by the U.S. government's intention to putinto operation an anti-Cuban ``Television Marti'' next month,Prensa Latina said.   ``Faced with the Yankee threat to begin transmissions againstCuba, larger-scale tests will be realized on national televisiontransmissions,'' the joint statement said.   It said Cuban equipment would achieve ``a considerable level ofdegradation of the enemy signal.''   The U.S. transmissions constitute ``a flagrant violation ofnational sovereignty and the norms and regulations fortelecommunications established by the United Nations and otherinternational organizations,'' the Cuban government statement said.</TEXT></DOC>
