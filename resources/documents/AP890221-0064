The egg was noticed Monday after Los Angeles Zoo researchersreviewed a videotape of activity in the condor's plywood nest boxand briefly saw it as the condors traded places from the nest to theoutside.   The couple, a male condor named Cuyama and a female namedCachuma, had piqued the interest of observers on Sunday when theyshowed signs indicating an egg-laying was near.   ``They were showing great interest in each other, nibbling eachother and following each other around to the nest box and scrapingaround as though making a nest in the sand,'' said Mike Wallace,curator of birds at the zoo and supervisor of its captive condorbreeding program.   He said the egg was the first for the Los Angeles Zoo program. Acondor egg laid in captivity was hatched last year in the program atthe San Diego Wild Animal Park.   Only 28 of the endangered California condors remain alive, 14 incaptivity at the Los Angeles Zoo and 14 more in San Diego.Scientists hope the vultures, which are North America's largest landbirds with 9{-foot wingspans, will reproduce enough so that some canbe returned to the wild in five to 10 years.   The breeding program has removed all known California condorsfrom the wild. Environmentalists have complained that other captivebreeding programs have met with only limited success.   The egg will be removed from the nest and placed in incubationsometime Wednesday, Wallace said. As part of the breeding program,scientists hope to have the birds produce as many as threefertilized eggs during the January to April mating season.   ``If you remove the first egg as soon as it's laid, they willrecycle and go into another mating ritual, and within 30 days layanother egg,'' he explained.   Experts will know in seven to 10 days whether the egg placed inthe incubator is fertilized, Wallace said. If it is, the chickshould hatch in 55 to 66 days.   Cuyama and Cachuma, both 6 years old and new to the courtingritual, have shown an interest in each other for the past few weeks,with Cuyama waltzing around Cachuma with outstretched wings, Wallacesaid.   ``We had seen attempts on (Cuyama's) part to copulate, but theywere not good ones because it's his first time and he's learninghow,'' Wallace said.   The other six condor couples at the zoo also have been incourtship over the past week.</TEXT></DOC>
