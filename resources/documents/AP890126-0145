LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Army troops razed or sealed seven Palestinianhouses Thursday to try to quell the Arab uprising, and Jewishsettlers said they would punish stone-throwers themselves becausethe army wasn't doing its job.   ``We are not satisfied with the security situation, even with thenew decisions,'' said settler official Uri Ariel, referring to thearmy's tough, new policy that includes firing plastic bullets atfleeing rioters or protesters blocking roads.   Elyakim Haetzni, another settler leader, said settlers wouldbegin making their own arrests of Palestinians and might shoot atthose who stone Jewish cars in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   In the occupied lands Thursday, soldiers shot and wounded 12youths in clashes with stone-throwers and shut down two schoolswhere rocks were thrown, Arab reporters and hospital officials said.   The army said it had reports of four shooting injuries in Gazaand the West Bank city of Nablus, and was checking other reports.   It also reported troops demolished five houses in the West Bankthat belonged to families of Palestinian suspects in firebombattacks on Israeli cars or soldiers.   Four homes were bulldozed in the village of Aqraba, one was blownup in Tulkarem, and one house also was sealed in each of the twoplaces, an army spokeswoman said.   In Tulkarem, she said, two soldiers were wounded in a firebombattack in September. The two-story house razed there belonged toMohammed Haloub, who has had one son deported during the 13-monthPalestinian uprising and three other sons jailed, Arab reports said.   The United States and human rights organizations have criticizedsuch house destructions, saying they violate international lawbecause the suspects are not tried.   Israeli officials maintain that house demolitions are legal. Theyare carried out under emegency laws adopted by the British rulers ofmandatory Palestine in 1945 when Jews were fighting for the right toestablish their own state.   An army official said Wednesday that more than 200 Palestinianhomes have been demolished or sealed during the uprising.   Last week, officials announced that house demolitions _previously used for firebomb suspects _ could now be directedagainst suspects in stone-throwing attacks that caused damage orinjury.   The move was included in measures introduced in a renewed effortto stop the ``intefadeh,'' the Arabic word for ``uprising'' that isused for the revolt against Israel's occupation of the West Bank andGaza Strip.   At least 369 Palestinians have been killed in the rebellion, mostby army gunfire. Fifteen Israelis also have died.   The growing casualty rate has brought criticism of the army fromleft-wing Israelis, and left-wing groups began a weekend protestagainst jailing of Palestinians without trial by setting up a tentcamp outside the Ketziot prison in southern Israel.   Abraham Hess, a survivor of the Nazi Holocaust taking part in theprotest, said on Israeli radio that harsh actions againstPalestinians were humiliating Israel.   ``You cannot forget that we were expelled from our own homes,''he said. ``We must stop this blood. This Palestinian nation wants tolive just as we did.''   In Jerusalem, officials of the settler movement Gush Emunim, or``Bloc of the Faithful,'' told reporters they would act against theuprising on their own since a 43-day fast by eight settlers failedto gain stronger army actions.   ``We sent out an SOS to the government that people wereconsidering taking actions into their own hands,'' Haetzni said.``So we are no longer responsible for what happens.''   He said the settlers sought legal advice and believed they hadthe right to arrest and in some cases shoot Palestinianstone-throwers.   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in enclaves among the 1.7million Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, whichwere captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.   The Defense Ministry confirmed, meanwhile, that the army soonwill release prominent PLO activist Faisal Husseini, who has beenheld without trial or specific charges for most of the past 21months.   Husseini, who was was arrested in July and ordered held for sixmonths, reportedly supports elections in the occupied lands if theyare not linked to autonomy.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has called for elections as a wayto start the peace process, but a spokesman for Rabin saidHusseini's release is not connected to his views on elections.   Rabin's plan called for elections and autonomy, which haverepeatedly been rejected by the PLO as inconsistent with its demandfor indepedence.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir also turned down Rabin's plan, andhe said Thursday no peace negotiations could begin until thePalestinian uprising ends.   ``I think there should be no infefadeh. It is not important howit stops,'' he said in northern Israel. ``When it is quiet, therewill be negotiations.''</TEXT></DOC>
