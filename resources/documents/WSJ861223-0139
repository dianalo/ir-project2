But cross biotech with electronics, and the story is different.    In this new, hybrid field, called bioelectronics, Japan boasts of a lead in moving from lab to market. &quot;Japan is ahead, without a doubt,&quot; says Isao Karube, biotechnology professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology.    A big part of that lead is a tiny device created by fusing organic matter to electrodes. Called a biosensor, the device converts natural chemical reactions into electric current to measure blood-sugar levels, monitor the brewing of beer, sniff out pollution, pick the freshest fish in the market or become a robot's &quot;nose.&quot;    Five Japanese government ministries and more than 50 companies have jumped into biosensor research in the past few years. Some analysts forecast a billion-dollar market by 1995. Says a Fujitsu Ltd. official: &quot;Biosensors are going to be a vital part of our daily lives.&quot;    Electronics giants such as NEC Corp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. are shrinking the devices to microchip size. They dream of a new generation of super-smart organic computer chips that can mimic human thought. Biotechnology &quot;could lead to a chip or computer that's entirely organic,&quot; says Ichiro Sugano, an NEC general manager. &quot;Biosensors are the first stepping stone.&quot;    The tale is familiar: Even as the West is polishing basic research in a promising high-tech field, the Japanese are rushing to refine those discoveries and get them to market. Biosensors represent Japan's hopes of grabbing the lead in bioelectronics, a field that could be important in the next century.    &quot;It's the same old story,&quot; says Christopher Lowe, director of the biotechnology center at Britain's Cambridge University. Biosensors &quot;have been targeted in the usual, thorough way.&quot; The West still leads in basic biosensor studies, Mr. Lowe says, and a few Western companies have moved from research to products. But the Japanese &quot;will walk away with the commercial applications in this area,&quot; he says.    In a living organism -- the human body, for instance, or a yeast -- certain organic substances &quot;sniff out&quot; specific chemicals. An antibody in the body might attack a specific influenza virus. A particular yeast will &quot;eat&quot; sugar and produce alcohol.    Biosensor researchers isolate such substances and attach them in a thin film to metal electrodes. Take glucose oxidase, an enzyme that consumes oxygen while it breaks down sugar. When the enzyme is attached to an electrode that detects oxygen, the two in combination can monitor blood-sugar levels, say, for a diabetic. The more sugar in the blood, the more oxygen the enzyme consumes and the less oxygen the electrode detects. The sensor sends an electric current to a computer, which converts it to a blood-sugar reading.    Industrial applications of biosensors often involve single-cell organisms such as yeast to monitor a production process. Asahi Breweries Ltd. is developing a biosensor using a yeast that &quot;drinks&quot; alcohol. The sensor will check alcohol levels in beer-brewing vats to control uneven fermentation.    Hideo Takahashi, a Fujitsu general manager, talks of a biosensor that detects several chemicals in fish. Measuring those chemicals would show if a fish was fresh.    Some of Mr. Karube's sensors developed at Tokyo Institute of Technology check for organic pollution in water. Others under study measure acid rain and specific air pollutants.    The promise of commercial application has charmed Japan's research-and-development machine. Government funding flows to the technology institute and other labs from the ministries of education, agriculture, science, construction and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Most of the researchers in Mr. Karube's labs are &quot;on loan&quot; from such industry giants as NEC, Fujitsu, Kao Corp. and Ajinomoto Co. Scores of other Japanese electronics makers, food companies, breweries and chemical companies are rushing to commercialize biosensors on their own.    Competition is stiff, and some cloak their research in secrecy. But researchers make no secret of where the original ideas for biosensors came from. Leading-edge basic research, they concede, is being done in places such as Britain's Cranfield Institute of Technology, France's Universite de Technologie de Compeigne and, in the U.S., the University of Utah. Several American companies were first to market biosensors.    But these first-generation biosensors are big, expensive and have limited applications, mostly in medicine. Moreover, says Cambridge University's Mr. Lowe, Western companies aren't taking their labs' latest discoveries to market as quickly as the Japanese. That gap will widen, he says, when it comes to the next generation of biosensors, which will be built right into tiny computer chips. &quot;The Japanese will sweep the board in that area,&quot; Mr. Lowe says.    Researchers have discovered that proteins can replace certain metals on semiconductor chips. NEC, Mitsubishi and others are building biosensor prototypes in a process similar to that for memory chips, and they expect to market them in several years. &quot;As much as possible, we're trying to use existing semiconductor-production methods,&quot; says Jun Kimura, chief of NEC's biosensor research.    Using such tried-and-true techniques, Mr. Kimura says, would make biosensors tiny, accurate and power-stingy. Computer circuits could be built right into the sensor to calculate data picked up by the biological matter on the chip, he says. Moreover, mass-produced like microchips, the sensors could be significantly less expensive than today's sensors.    Tiny biosensor microchips could open up a world of possibilities. NEC engineers talk of pencil-sized blood-sugar testers. Chips in the tips of hypodermic needles could constantly monitor a patient's bloodstream. They could be implanted in artificial organs. Chiba Medical School is working with Mr. Karube's labs to design a biosensor chip to measure chemicals in an artificial kidney.    Not all biosensor efforts are succeeding. Yeast cells in some sensors are hard to keep alive. Asahi Breweries' alcohol sensor, for instance, survives only three days. It must last at least a month to be viable, the company says. Kirin Brewery Co. dropped similar research, favoring a sensor that doesn't use organic matter. Its yeast-based sensors couldn't withstand tank washings. &quot;There were some very fundamental problems,&quot; says a Kirin spokesman. </TEXT></DOC>
