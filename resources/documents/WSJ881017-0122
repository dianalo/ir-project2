The hotly contested ethane supply issue pitted the petrochemical companies, particularly Nova, against major natural gas producers, which wanted greater freedom to market ethane, a natural gas component.    Under the government's policy, Alberta's petrochemical producers will be assured an ethane supply from existing straddle plants, from the government's ethane royalty share and from new ethane plants that are to be built in gas fields. The straddle plants are so-called because they straddle natural gas pipelines, extracting ethane from the gas.    Nova and Dow Chemical Canada Inc. said the Alberta government's decision gave them the assurance they needed to proceed with their plans to build two ethylene plants in Alberta that will use ethane as the feedstock. Nova already operates two Alberta ethylene plants that are supplied with low cost ethane from straddle plants. Ethylene, a major building block for the petrochemical industry, is used to make a wide range of products such as plastics and anti-freeze.    Nova, based in Calgary, Alberta, had threatened to scrap its plans to build the third plant if it wasn't assured an adequate ethane supply. John Feick, president of Nova's petrochemical unit, Novacor Chemicals Ltd., said the Alberta government's ethane supply announcement was &quot;a workable compromise.&quot; Nova's new ethylene plant, with a planned annual capacity of 1.5 billion pounds, is expected to start production by 1992. Along with associated plants by itself and others, Nova has estimated that its project will mean a total investment of C$1.5 billion.    Dow Chemical's C$800 million ethylene project, which was announced last month, is scheduled to start up in 1993, with an initial capacity of one billion pounds.    The expansion of Alberta's petrochemical industry has been encouraged by the planned U.S.-Canada free trade agreement that is to take effect Jan. 1. The agreement will eliminate petrochemical tariffs over five years, including a steep 12.4% U.S. tariff on polyethylene.    Alberta's petrochemical industry has benefited from preferentially low prices for ethane from the straddle plants. In the future, ethane prices will be set by negotiation and, failing this, by arbitration, the Alberta government said. Natural gas producers have other potential markets for their ethane including its use as a solvent to enhance production from old oil wells.    Alberta Energy Minister Neil Webber said the government's ethane policy &quot;would ensure availability of a minimum supply of ethane from the straddle plant system while allowing the construction of new field plants to extract increased volumes of ethane and other natural gas liquids.&quot;    He said the precise amount of ethane that may be extracted by the straddle plants will be determined by an Alberta agency, the Energy Resources Conservation Board.    Economic Development Minister Larry Shaben said Alberta's ethane supply is large enough to support enhanced oil recovery projects and existing and planned petrochemical projects.    Mr. Feick said he was confident that there was enough ethane for Nova's planned new ethylene project, but he said he wasn't sure whether there was enough for two new ethylene plants.    Nova's third plant would raise its annual ethylene output to about 4.5 million pounds from a current three million pounds, about 1.8 million pounds of which is sold to Dow Canada, which relies on Nova for all its ethylene. The third plant would boost Nova's share of North America's ethylene capacity to about 10%.    Nova and Dow Chemical said a joint venture or &quot;accommodation&quot; between the two companies' projects remains possible. However, William McCagherty, a Dow Chemical Canada vice president, said Dow Canada has made &quot;a strategic decision that we are going to have some ethylene manufacturing facilities&quot; in Alberta. </TEXT></DOC>
