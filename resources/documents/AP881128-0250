(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chester Langway's laboratory holds six milesof ice that reveal volumes about Earth's past and, perhaps, itsfuture.   ``It's all there ... frozen in time,'' said Langway, whoseUniversity of Buffalo lab contains the nation's store of ice coresamples from Greenland and Antarctica _ a record of natural historystretching 150,000 years.   Ice, formed as layer after layer of snow fell and was compacted,provides a seasonal record more detailed than tree rings or seafloor sediments, he said.   Using techniques Langway pioneered, researchers have begunanalyzing ancient ice molecules. Oxygen isotopes record yearlytemperature variations. Dust levels show prehistoric volcanicactivity. Tiny bubbles of air give direct evidence of what theatmosphere was like thousands of years ago. The water that makes upthe ice can indicate natural levels of elements such as lead,cadmium, sulfur and chlorine, and can be used to gauge the effectindustrial activity.   The ice cores, six miles of them, are kept in 4-inch-diameter,meter-long aluminum cylinders in a refrigerator at 10 degrees belowzero. Technicians in parkas, their beards and eyebrows frosted,prepare the ice for Langway's experiments and for shipment toscientists at another universities.   ``We're just beginning to unlock the secrets in the ice,'' saidLangway, 59, a heavy-set, chain-smoking geology professor who has amountain named after him in Antarctica. He sometimes jokes aboutspending more than five years in polar regions researching ice _``Man is the only animal stupid enough to wander about out there'' _but he clearly believes in his work.   Particularly in some controversial research involving gasestrapped in the ice cores. Scientists have noted a sharp increase incarbon dioxide in the last 150 years since the beginning of theindustrial age, part of the debate about the ``greenhouse effect,''global warming from the buildup of heat-trapping gases fromindustrial emissions and deforestation.   ``A full understanding of how the planet works can't be obtainedwithout considering the ice,'' Langway said. Changes in the level ofcarbon dioxide in the past have coincided with changes in theclimate. Levels of the gas may even be part of a mechanism thatcauses ice ages and global warming trends.   There have been seven or eight times when the Earth's climatechanged drastically, with glaciers enveloping the continents andthen retreating, he explained. Carbon dioxide levels were very low20,000 years ago, when the Earth was at its coldest. About 13,000years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide began to increase. About10,000 years ago, the ice began to retreat amidst violent weatherchanges probably brought about by increase volcanic activity.   Some scientists think the Earth may soon undergo a major climatechange brought on by pollution. They have developed computer modelsshowing disastrous consequences such as droughts and rising oceanlevels over the next 50 years.   Langway, however, is emphatic about not drawing conclusions forthe future from current ice core research. ``You can speculate likehell, but we just haven't done enough research to have all theanswers.''   One problem is a shortage of ice. Greenland's ice sheet is thesize of the United States east of the Mississippi, and Antarctica is10 times larger; even six miles of cores in storage is ``likeputting a teacup in Boston and one in Florida and trying to figureout what's been going on in between,'' he said.   Langway will take part in two international expeditions next yearthat will drill in Greenland and Antarctica _ the first new drillingsince 1981.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 1</NOTE></DOC>
