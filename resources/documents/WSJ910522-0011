It settled at $21.40, up three cents for the day.   Some traders attributed the volatility to technicalfactors and to yesterday's expiration of the June contract.But July crude also went up and down sharply, reaching anintraday high of $21.53 a barrel before closing at $21.06,down 23 cents for the day.   Also, similar swings took place on the IPE in London.There, after trading most of the day in a slightly higher butnarrow range July Brent blend crude fell off in the last halfhour. It ended at $19.33 a barrel, 24 cents lower than theprevious closing.   There was little fundamental news to justify the priceswings except for confirmation that output from the Brentproduction system in the U.K. sector of the North Sea will bemuch higher in June than in May, when it was slowed bymaintenance. According to Dow Jones International PetroleumReport, the operator of the Brent blend system said thepipeline's throughput is expected to average about 447,000barrels a day in June, up from 160,000 barrels a day in May.   In U.S. trading, some futures brokers said thatbargain-hunting, technical factors and speculation firmed upprices yesterday before the buying dried up. Peter Beutel,energy director at Pegasus Econometric Group, called it a&quot;magic carpet&quot; act. &quot;The market went up on thin air beforethe rug was pulled out from under it.&quot;   News that could put new downward pressure on crude oil andgasoline prices in today's trading came out after the futuresmarket had closed. The American Petroleum Institute releasedits weekly report on U.S. oil inventories, which showed bigincreases for crude oil and gasoline. Crude oil inventoriesrose last week by 6.2 million barrels while gasoline stocksclimbed 3.2 million barrels.   Late yesterday, refiners began rescinding increases of thepast two days of 25 cents a barrel in the prices they pay forcrude in the U.S. oil fields. This dropped the general fieldposting for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude,back to $20.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices rallied in latetrading on growing prospects that the U.S. will grantadditional bonus credits for grain purchases by the SovietUnion. Allan Mendelowitz, a director of Congress's GeneralAccounting Office, told a House agriculture subcommittee thatnothing in farm law needs to be changed for the Bushadministration to grant additional credit to the SovietUnion. This, coupled with the U.S. Agriculture Department'sindication that it is close to making a decision on the bonuscredits issue, fed speculation on trading floors that creditmay soon be forthcoming, said Daniel Basse, director ofmarket research for AgResource Co., Chicago. Commodity funds-- organized pools of investor money -- were aggressivebuyers of grain futures contracts late in the day. The corncontract for July delivery rose 3.25 cents to $2.5075 abushel; the July soybean contract rose 7.25 cents to $5.79 abushel; and the July wheat contract rose 2.25 cents to $2.95a bushel.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices fell. Coffee for July delivery lost2.2 cents a pound to settle at 87.55 cents. Traders weredisappointed that, contrary to rumors, Brazilian andColombian officials aren't meeting to discuss aninternational coffee quota system later this month, saidCeleste Georgakis, senior analyst at Cargill InvestorServices. Colombian and Brazilian officials told her that thecountries are meeting about other matters, but not coffee,Ms. Georgakis said. When the price fell below 89 cents apound, standing sell orders were triggered, she added. JudithGanes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, believes coffee pricesare near their bottom and shouldn't fall much more.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices rallied on buying based ontechnical factors, analysts said. Orange juice for Julydelivery ended 4.35 cents a pound higher at $1.2140.Aggressive buying by speculators and funds initially pushedup prices to levels that triggered standing buy orders, saidMs. Georgakis of Cargill Investor Services. There was no newsbehind the buying, said Ms. Ganes of Merrill Lynch, andsupply-and-demand factors don't support these prices. Shealso noted that the market has a high proportion ofspeculators with bets the price will rise, which makes themarket vulnerable to a rapid sell-off on any sign ofweakness.</TEXT></DOC>
