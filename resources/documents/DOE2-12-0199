<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0199 </DOCNO><TEXT>The high-temperature superconducting oxides are sensitively dependenton small percent differences in doping for their superconducting character.We have studied the optical properties of samples in which the dopingof Sr in La/sub 2-//sub x/Sr/sub x/CuO/sub 4-//sub {delta}/, is varied.The techniques of reflectance and ellipsometric spectroscopy were usedto cover the energy range from 0.3 eV to 6 eV. These revealed correlationsbetween the electronic properties of the material and its ability tosuperconduct as quantified by the critical temperature and the Meissnereffect. In particular, the strength of an optical absorption structureat {similar_to}0.5 eV is found to vary with Sr content in parallel withthe superconductivity of the material. Significantly, the energetic positionof the structure is fixed for the broad range of doping studied, indicatingthat it is not simply a plasmon excitation of the carriers introducedby doping. These results suggest a common root between the electronicstructure associated with the optical absorption and the mechanism forsuperconductivity.</TEXT></DOC>
