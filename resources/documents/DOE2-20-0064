Digitalangiographic images and 10 x 10-cm spot films were obtained at variouscontrast concentrations and with and without mask subtraction. The filmswere digitized with a 1X and 4X magnification factor. Reference pointswere chosen along the vessel. The computer program automatically generateda vessel centerline along with density profiles perpendicular to theline. Vessel edges were determined using a Gaussian fit to the cross-sectionaldensity profiles. This techniques is more accurate and less sensitiveto noise than threshold- or gradient-based edge detection techniques.Relative changes along the vessel of the densitometric cross-sectionalarea calculated after logarithmic transformation and interpolative backgroundsubtraction were used to assess percent stenosis. Experimental resultswere comparable in both digital and cineangiograms (r = .96 and r = .97,respectively); however, cineangiograms showed a higher variability. Magnificationapplied during film digitization resulted in a more accurate edge detection.This technique provides a means for rapid quantitative evaluation ofboth digital angiograms and cineangiograms.</TEXT></DOC>
