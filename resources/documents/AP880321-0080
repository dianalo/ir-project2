RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to decidewhether an airline may be forced to reinstate workers when theirstrike ends, making necessary the layoffs of trainees and employeeswho crossed the picket lines.   The court said it will study an appeal by Trans World Airlinesin a dispute stemming from a 1986 strike by flight attendants.   TWA and the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants had athree-year contract that expired July 31, 1984. When negotiationsfailed, the union called a strike on March 7, 1986.   TWA hired more than 1,220 new flight attendants after the strikebegan. In addition, about 1,280 TWA flight attendants crossedpicket lines either at the outset of the walkout or as the strikecontinued for more than two months.   TWA also placed new flight attendants in training, including 463who had not completed training when the strike ended May 17, 1986.   The union then filed a federal lawsuit charging TWA withunlawfully refusing to reinstate more than 2,000 workers who hadgone out on strike.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last May that somestriking flight attendants were entitled to their old jobs at theexpense of all trainees and some flight attendants who had crossedthe picket lines.   The appeals court said the strikers should be reinstated if theyhad more seniority than those, called cross-overs, who had nothonored the picket lines.   But the appeals court also said the 1,220 flight attendantshired during the strike could not be dislodged by any of those whostayed out during the strike.   With regard to the cross-overs, the 8th Circuit court said theymay not be given preferential treatment over striking workers withmore seniority ``because such action impermissibly discriminatesamong union members based on the degree of their union activity.''   ``An employer may not divide the workforce into those whoengaged in strike activity and those who did not,'' the appealscourt said.   It said the 463 trainees cannot be considered permanentreplacements in the same category as the 1,220 newly hired flightattendants. Therefore, the trainees ``were subject to displacementby returning strikers,'' the appeals court said.   The distinctions were made under the Railway Labor Act, whichgoverns airlines as well as railroads.   TWA said it is ``simply incomprehensible'' to force employeeschoosing not to strike to give up their jobs in favor of``unsuccessful strikers.''   By a 4-4 vote on March 2, the Supreme Court ruled in anothercase growing out of the 1986 TWA strike that an airline may beforced to continue collecting union dues from workers after itscontract with employees has expired.   TWA sought to discontinue the dues check-off after the strikeended. But the justices' split vote automatically upheld an 8thCircuit court ruling that the airline may not cancel the check-offprovision unless it is agreed to in negotiations with the workers.   The case is TWA vs. Independent Federation of Flight Attendants,87-548.</TEXT></DOC>
