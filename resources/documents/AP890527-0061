It remained unclear whether the two sides could resolve theirdifferences over medical benefits, described by one source as ``themajor block to a settlement.'' Also up in the air was whether theunions would immediately call a strike in the absence of asettlement.   After a long and frantic day of negotiating Friday, both sidespublicly continued to express hope of reaching new contracts beforeexisting pacts affecting about 160,000 workers expire at 11:59 p.m.EDT. But they say such a development hinges on a major breakthroughon the benefits package, which has dominated the talks from theoutset.   ``If we can settle health care _ no easy task _ then we canreach agreement on wages and the other issues,'' a union sourcesaid late Friday. ``This is the major block to a settlement.''   Sources close to the negotiations said progress has been madebut they cautioned that negotiations are at a fragile stage andcould turn for the worse. In an arrangement likely to be repeatedtoday, formal negotiating committees met Friday at a Washingtonhotel while the two union presidents and ATandamp;T's top negotiator heldseparate meetings periodically on the major issues.   It remained unclear as the deadline approached whether theunions would call a strike immediately if no agreement is reached.Union officials have refused to disclose their plans but havehinted strongly that they would not strike right away, particularlyif agreement on a contract appeared near.   Instead, the unions have a number of other strategies designedto pressure the American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. into asettlement, primarily a nationwide labor boycott of ATandamp;Tlong-distance service that the unions contend could cut thecompany's long-distance revenues by up to 8 percent.   As two levels of negotiations continued late Friday, both sidesreported progress but said bitter union opposition to ATandamp;T's healthcare proposal remained a substantial barrier to a settlement.   The unions, the Communications Workers of America and theInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, vehemently opposeATandamp;T's demand that workers pay more up front for medical care. Thecompany says it needs to reduce its $1 billion annual medical bill,but the unions have demanded expanded benefits while promising todevise new cost-control measures.   Hectic negotiations Friday were marked by repeated exchanges ofproposals and counter offers, including a significant ATandamp;T offer tolimit the use of temporary workers _ a key union job-securitydemand.   The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said ATandamp;Tproposed in an informal meeting among top officials from both sidesto revise its health care package. Neither side would discussdetails. But a union official said, ``It was a reconfiguration ofthe existing offer and it is unacceptable.''   In addition to offering to regulate use of temporary workers,ATandamp;T has amended and expanded its contract proposal to improve eyeand dental care and its parental leave policy, company officialssaid. Also, it has proposed for the first time allowing leave forworkers to care for sick relatives.   Those proposals are in addition to the formal offer the companymade Monday, a package which provided varying base wage increasesand lump sum payments depending on job classification and also anew profit-sharing plan for union workers.</TEXT></DOC>
