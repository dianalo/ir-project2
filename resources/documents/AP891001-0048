(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker returns to the stand for morecross-examination at his fraud trial Monday, after a session lastweek that even his defense lawyer says ``very devastating'' to hiscase.   Bakker, charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy relatedto his handling of finances at the television ministry, testifiedFriday that he never defrauded anyone or conspired with others atPTL to commit fraud. He is expected to wind up his testimony Monday.   The case probably will go to the jury late this week.   George Davis, Bakker's lead defense attorney, didn't appearconfident that Bakker's testimony Friday had convinced the jury hisclient is innocent.   ``That was a pretty heavy cross-examination,'' the 82-year-oldDavis told the Greensboro News andamp; Record when asked how he thoughtthe questioning had gone. ``It was very damaging, verydevastating.''   He smiled weakly and added, ``It didn't have anything to do withthe issues, but ... ''   Several episodes during Friday's testimony indicated Bakker'steam may have been caught off-guard.   In one instance, a defense chart was ruled inadmissible partlybecause it summarized information not in evidence.   In several other instances, Bakker claimed he had told viewerson his television shows that some changes would be made in the PTLlodging programs at issue in the charges against him.   But he was unable to say when he made the announcements, eventhough the defense has had access for several months to the samePTL videotapes and program summaries that the government has.   During three hours of cross-examination, Bakker answered ``Idon't remember'' or its equivalent more than three dozen times.   During his initial testimony, Bakker said that when he left PTLin March 1987, he had built, was building or had plans foraccommodations for more than 211,000 ``lifetime partners'' for PTL.   Lifetime partnerships are the PTL lodging benefits at issue inthe fraud charges. PTL offered contributors free lodging at hotelsat PTL's Heritage USA retreat _ typically three nights each yearfor life _ in exchange for contributions, typically $1,000.   Bakker is accused of exceeding the announced limits on thenumber of partnerships. He's also accused of diverting most of the$158 million in proceeds from the announced purpose of constructionto PTL's general operating expenses, including about $3.7 millionin salary and bonuses for himself from 1984 to 1987.   About 152,000 lifetime partnerships were sold between January1984 and May 1987, including 66,000 in the Heritage Grand Hotel,where Bakker had said only 25,000 would be sold, and 74,000 in thestill-unfinished Towers hotel, where Bakker had said only 30,000would be sold.   Bakker attempted to show jurors a summary chart of the varioushotels, lodges, bunkhouses, chalets and campsites he said couldhave accommodated the 211,000 partners.   But prosecutor Deborah Smith and fellow prosecutor Jerry Millerkept the chart from being admitted into evidence.   They argued that the chart summarized information that was notin evidence. The defense had neither introduced its own evidencethat some of the facilities were to be built nor elicited thattestimony from witnesses.   They also said it was misleading. Bakker said ``overflow'' fromthe hotels could be housed in some of the other facilities, butprosecutors pointed out that lifetime partners had been offeredtheir choice of lodging.   Bakker's direct testimony, answering questions from his ownattorney, dealt largely with his career and with his vision for PTL.   But he touched several times on the difficulty of raising enoughmoney to keep PTL going.   ``You never, ever, ever get away from the pressure you have toraise money for next week, next month, next year,'' he said.   Bakker insisted that his lifetime partnership programs neverdeceived his viewers, and that he never hid information from hisboard of directors as the government has charged.   He flatly accused one former employee _ former top aide DavidTaggart _ of lying when Taggart testified that Bakker had him relayinstructions to divert Lifetime Partnership money to PTL's generalexpenses.</TEXT></DOC>
