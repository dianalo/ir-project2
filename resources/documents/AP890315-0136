Under questioning by defense lawyers at Oliver North'sIran-Contra trial, McFarlane detailed how Reagan initialed a plan inmid-February 1985 that resulted in Honduras getting speeded-updeliveries of rifles, ammunition and machine guns.   The matter was so sensitive, McFarlane acknowledged underquestioning, that the arrangement was discussed verbally with theHonduran president and was not given to him in writing.   North's lawyers say the Reagan administration had a policy ofhiding its quid pro quo arrangements with other countries to supportthe Contras during a two-year congressional ban on U.S. military aidto the rebels.   Five of the 12 criminal charges against North, a former WhiteHouse aide, are that he made false statements and obstructedCongress in 1985 and 1986 with regard to his activities on behalf ofthe Contras.   McFarlane said Reagan initialed a Feb. 18, 1985 memo approvingthe secret arrangements with Honduras. The memo was signed byMcFarlane and had been prepared by North and another NationalSecurity Council staffer. It was the culmination of discussions byCabinet officials in the administration.   McFarlane agreed with defense attorney Brendan Sullivan that theextra aid to Honduras was worth ``tens of millions of dollars.''   Sullivan mentioned during McFarlane's testimony a Feb. 25, 1985memo by the former national security adviser marked ``enhancedsupport for Honduras.'' In it, McFarlane stated: ``We seem to bewell on our way to release of $35 million.''   After the quid pro quo arrangement went in effect, McFarlane saidhe got a memo from then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger sayingthat expedited delivery of military equipment had begun.   The additional aid also included other unspecified assistancefrom an unidentified government agency.   At the time of the quid pro quo arrangements, Honduras washarboring many of the Contras in camps along the country's southernborder and Honduran officials feared troops of Nicaragua's leftistgovernment might attack them.   In April 1985, a Honduran military official stopped a shipment ofammunition to the Contras and McFarlane in an April 25, 1985 noteurged Reagan to telephone the Honduran president and have him letthe shipment go through, the trial was told.   Reagan sent back comments saying he had told the Honduranpresident ``to deliver the ammunition.'' Reagan and the Hondranpresident also discussed the fact that Honduran officials werecoming to the United States and would discuss about $15 million inaid for Honduras when they met with then-Secretary of State GeorgeShultz and Weinberger.   McFarlane's testimony followed a temporary halt in the trial thismorning as North's lawyers tried to introduce classified materialwhile cross-examining the former national security official.   The dispute erupted after Sullivan, while questioning McFarlane,tried to introduce a Feb. 11, 1985, memo from North and another manto McFarlane. The memo, relayed to members of the National SecurityCouncil, concerned Honduras and a buildup of Contra forces.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell called lawyers to the bench,saying with resignation, ``I guess we'll have to do it this way.''After a few minutes, he announced he would have to send the jury outof the courtroom. The lawyers then argued over the matter behindclosed doors.   Gesell has said he wants to avoid a ``cuckoo-clock trial'' inwhich national security concerns trigger repeated delays in theproceedings.   The dispute came after Gesell said he would decline to rule nowon the question of whether classified material that North's lawyerswant to introduce should be allowed into the case.   Gesell said he will rule on a piecemeal basis in connection withthe information North's attorneys want to present in cross-examiningMcFarlane.   Prosecutor John Keker said Sullivan has three books of materialhe wants to use in cross-examining McFarlane which containclassified material. Keker said he wanted the judge to rule now onwhether classifed material from those books should be presented incensored form or be allowed in an uncensored format.   Gesell refused, saying that would involve two or three days ofhearings on secrecy questions and that ``I have told you scores oftimes'' that he was going to give the defense wide latitude incross-examining prosecution witnesses.   The judge said he will make individual rulings from the bench asthe classified material comes up.   Keker said he was seeking an orderly procedure in which thesequestions would be raised ahead of time and that a review of thethree books wouldn't take two or three days, but rather a matter ofhours.   In connection with one matter, Gesell said North's lawyers willbe permitted to introduce the names of Central American countriesand Central American officials from a document spelling out theReagan administration's quid pro quo arrangements with thirdcountries. Those arrangements involved offering inducements to thecountries in exchange for their support of the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
