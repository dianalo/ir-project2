Informal meetings have been going on all week during the arrivalof delegates from the 151 member governments, as well asrepresentatives of banks and industrial companies.   At the top of most governments' concerns is the burden ofinterest payments on developing countries' debt, due to reach $1.2billion by the end of this year.   In New York the biggest debtor _ Brazil, which owes about $120billion _ is to sign a new $82 billion agreement with its creditorbanks, including $5.2 billion in new loans to help the nation coverits obligations for 1987, 1988 and the first half of next year.Brazil suspended interest payments on its debt in February 1987,but officially ended the moratorium on Wednesday.   But new money lent by banks goes largely to pay interest on olddebt. Third World governments will ask wealthier governments, andthe bank and fund, to increase their lending.   Later in the week, the wealthier countries will meet on theirown problems as well as those of the Third World. The mostimportant session will be by the ``Group of Seven,'' comprising theUnited States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada andItaly.   The Third World debt problem has been getting much vocalsympathy in Berlin. A ``Counter-Congress'' consisting of critics ofthe World Bank and IMF also opens on Thursday.   On Wednesday, former West German Chancellor Willy Brandtappealed for debt reductions for developing nations. With PresidentReagan's administration taking the lead, the World Bank and IMFhave resisted such pleas as counterproductive. The United Stateshas the largest share of voting strength in both entities.   Critics of the IMF and World Bank say the need to make interestpayments, and conditions set by the fund and bank for new loans,compel governments to raise prices and to reduce wages. Fund andbank officials argue that such policies are needed to prevent worsesuffering, and to put the debtor countries into better position toborrow again.   Mobilizing criticism here has been the left-wing Green party,whichhas representatives in the Berlin legislature and the WestGerman parliament.   The group, which says it disapproves of violence as a politicalmethod, plans a mass demonstration in Berlin on Sunday, when ithopes to bring 40,000 protesters into the streets.   The Greens also have taken the lead in organizing a ``PermanentPeoples' Tribunal'' to meet Monday and accuse the bank and fund ofdamaging the environment and violating the United Nations charter.   Spokesmen for the IMF and World Bank say they will furnishinformation to the organizers but will not send representatives toappear at the four-day session.</TEXT></DOC>
