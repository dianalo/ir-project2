While many Venezuelans, including members of his ownparty, are pressing Mr. Perez to soften parts of his tougheconomic program, he and Finance Minister Pedro Rosas Bravosaid in separate interviews that they plan to keep pushingreforms, including easing restrictions on foreign banks,further liberalizing trade and overhauling the tax system.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I think it would be a dramatic error for my government tochange its economic policy,&quot; Mr. Perez said at thebullet-riddled Miraflores Palace. &quot;Our policy has yieldedindisputable successes. It takes time for the benefits toshow, but they will within a year.&quot;   Mr. Rosas added: &quot;There will be no modification in thefundamental line of economic policy because the hardest partof the adjustment is behind us. We're going to deepen theprogram.&quot;   That's good news to businessmen, who hail Venezuela as amodel for the freemarket wave sweeping South America, butmany others feel the government's insistence on the measuresin the face of deep popular discontent is dangerously out ofstep with the country's mood.   Indeed, from shantytowns to posh neighborhoods, manyVenezuelans express support for Lt. Col. Hugo Chavez Frias,the coup leader. While the nationalistic rebels don't appearto have had much of an economic agenda, they are seen asembodying a broad desire for change. While Mr. Perez'spolicies have fueled rapid growth and improved economicindicators, their effects have yet to trickle down, andopposition to his program is strong.   The government says the situation is returning to normal,and it is easing press restrictions it imposed after the coupattempt, but many analysts fear riots or even another coupattempt if the government doesn't relax its policies. &quot;Theclimate of worry can lead to an explosion at any time,&quot; sayseconomist Domingo Maza Zavala. &quot;The government should listenmore to the people. It shouldn't modify the fundamentalguidelines of its policy, but it has to make adjustments.&quot;   Mr. Maza advocates a Mexican-style negotiatedwage-and-price policy, a currency revaluation and more socialspending. Others are pressing for price controls and anincrease in the minimum wage, currently about $100 a month.   But the government says these are ineffective andinflationary solutions. It advocates deepening thefree-market program, while launching social-welfare programsfunded by receipts from the privatization of state companies,which continues this month with the sale of some hotels.   Mr. Rosas says he aims to cut the top import tariff rateto 20% from 40%. He also hopes Congress will allow foreignbanks to set up shop in Venezuela and ease restrictions onforeign ownership of local banks. The government also plansto push tax reform to diversify its revenue sources,currently largely dependent on oil.   But many analysts warn that the government faces a raceagainst time to show that these policies improve the generalwell-being. &quot;Before the coup, everyone talked aboutVenezuela's democracy and free-market policies,&quot; says onebusinessman. &quot;But if there aren't quick results, both arethreatened.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
