ReportSays</HEAD><BYLINE>By VIOREL URMA</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   International drug traffickers are movingincreasing quantities of illegal narcotics, threatening governments'stability and contributing to a sharp rise in drug-related deaths, aU.N. report said today.   The 1988 annual report by the International Narcotics ControlBoard, which last year warned that drug trafficking groups in LatinAmerica challenged state authorities, did not single out any regionfor particular blame.   ``Illicit production and manufacture of drugs take place in agrowing number of countries,'' the 31-page report says.   ``These activities continue to be carried out by criminalorganizations ... which often join forces with terrorist groups,spread violence and corruption, threaten political institutions,undermine the integrity of national economies and imperil the verysecurity of countries,'' it said.   In the United States, the report said the estimated quantities ofillicit drugs entering the country continued to rise, especiallycocaine.   One bright spot cited in the report was a 1987 survey of U.S.high school and college students that indicated drug-abuse decliningamong that group. The survey found for the first time a 20 percentdecrease in cocaine use by high school and college students andyoung adults.   The Vienna-based board works with the World Health Organizationand other U.N. agencies. It said its report was based on data fromgovernments, the United Nations, Interpol and other internationalorganizations.   Many countries provide information voluntarily.   However, the report said that of the world's 185 countries andterritories, only 10 _ Angola, Bolivia, Brunei, Cambodia, NorthKorea, Gambia, Israel, St. Lucia, Vietnam and Zambia _ declined toprovide drug-related data.   ``During 1988, the gravity of the situation, which preoccupiesthe highest levels of governments, has led to strongcounterattacks'' by governments, the report says. It singled out acoordinated enforcement operation in August that featured 30countries in the Americas and Western Europe.   The effort led to the seizure of 12 tons of cocaine, dismantlingof 13 cocaine laboratories, destruction of seven clandestineairstrips and arrest of at least 1,000 people, the report says.   In another development, a U.N. conference last month ended afour-year fight against illicit drug trafficking and drug abuse,adopting a document giving all signatory countries the right toextradite suspected drug traffickers and the right to confiscate alltheir assets.   But observers say the document, signed by 43 countries, may takeyears to become legally binding.   The report says drug-related deaths increased sharply during 1987and the first three months of 1988, with heroin the main killer.   It singled out West Germany, where 1,362 people died during thatperiod, compared with 606 who died in 1986 and the first threemonths of 1987.   The report also noted:   _ Opium production in southeast Asia remains high despitecampaigns to eradicate opium poppy cultivation. Abundant opium,together with the availability of essential chemicals, facilitateheroin production in clandestine laboratories near the borders ofBurma, Laos and Thailand.   _ Transit trafficking of opium and heroin was reported tocontinue unabated in Iran, despite vigorous law enforcement backedby severe penalties.   _ In the Soviet Union, health and law enforcement authoritieshave expanded activities aimed at eliminating the abuse of certaindrugs and mind-altering substances. Stricter laws have been enactedto prosecute traffickers, and serious drug offenses can draw up to10 years in jail.</TEXT></DOC>
