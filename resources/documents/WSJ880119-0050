The service would be provided by PennEast Gas Services Co., a joint venture formed by Consolidated and Texas Eastern in 1986 to serve the New York metropolitan area and New England.    PennEast, under three separate proposals, would supply 687 million cubic feet of gas a day to the region. Some of that gas would originate in Canada. Total cost of the projects would be $421 million.    In a related fourth proposal, Houston-based Texas Eastern said it proposed a restructuring of its existing sales contract with Consolidated and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. to reduce sales to the two customers by 150 million cubic feet of gas a day. That amount of gas would then be sold to PennEast starting Nov. 1, 1989, and could in turn be resold in the New York and New England market areas.    Pittsburgh-based Consolidated produces, transports and distributes natural gas primarily in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York and other Northeast states. Texas Eastern supplies natural gas to the New York/New Jersey area and operates a pipeline system that stretches from the Gulf Coast to Boston. </TEXT></DOC>
