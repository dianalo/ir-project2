Home Savings said it has applied to regulatory agencies to mergeinto its Bowery Savings Bank subsidiary in order to become a savingsbank.   Applications were made to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. andthe Federal Home Loan Bank Board for Home Savings to become anFDIC-insured federal savings bank, said Richard H. Deihl, chairmanand chief executive officer of Home Savings and Bowery Savings Bank.   Bowery Savings Bank's deposits currently are insured by the FDIC.The bank was acquired by Home Savings of America in January 1988.   ``If we remain in the FSLIC (Federal Savings andamp; Loan InsuranceCorp.) and the Bush administration's proposal is adopted in itspresent draft form, Home Savings of America _ by virtue of the factthat we have the largest deposit base of any U.S. savingsinstitution _ will be forced to bear the largest cost burden toresolve the problems of the FSLIC, problems we did not create andwhich arose from policies we strongly oppose,'' Deihl said in astatement Friday.   The Bush administration wants to rescue the ailing Sandamp;L industryby selling $50 billion in bonds to raise money needed to closeinsolvent institutions.   The plan would strip the FSLIC from its parent agency, theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, and merge it into the FDIC, whichguarantees bank deposits.   It also includes raising Sandamp;L premiums from $2.08 per $1,000 indeposits to $2.30. Bank premiums would go from 83 cents to $1.50.   Deihl said Home Savings of America earned an after-tax profit of$1 billion over the past five years, and last year was the largesthome mortgage lender in the nation. The Sandamp;L also has paid more than$170 million in deposit insurance premiums to the FSLIC over thelast four years.   Home Savings paid nearly $50 million in deposit insurancepremiums in 1988 alone, including $45 million to the FSLIC covering$24.4 billion of FSLIC-insured deposits, and $4 million to FDIC forBowery Savings Bank's $5.1 billion deposit base, the company said.   Deihl added: ``Under the current FDIC insurance premiumstructure, premium costs on the company's $29.5 billion deposit basewould have been $25 million _ half the amount paid last year. Evenif FDIC premiums doubled from present levels, Home's deposit costsfor FDIC insurance would still be well below that paid in 1988.''   Allan Bortel, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., saidthe thrift's move ``is their way of saying `We're mad as hell andwon't take it any more.'''   Regulatory approval of the merger is necessary, includingapproval of a Nov. 1, 1988, application to convert The BowerySavings Bank to a federally chartered savings bank. The bank is nowa New York state-chartered institution.   Home Savings of America, with assets of $40 billion, is theprincipal subsidiary of H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co. Home Savings of America,including the Bowery Savings Bank and Savings of America divisions,operates 352 branches in nine states and 104 mortgage lendingoffices in 18 states.</TEXT></DOC>
