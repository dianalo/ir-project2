Grossman recently interviewed Avie Tevanian, one of theprincipal developers of Mach while at Carnegie-Mellon.andM;Tevanian is now the chief operating-system scientist at NeXT Inc. in PaloAlto, Calif.andM;----------PC Week: How is Mach different from Unix?andM;Tevanian: Unix is a much richer system, at least in its most current form,when compared to Mach.andP;  [Unix] has TCP/IP protocols and complete file-systemsupport.andM;These things could be built in the &quot;Mach way&quot; but need not be because theyalready exist [in Unix].andM;PC Week: So you didn't feel the need to invent a whole new operating system?andM;Tevanian: That's exactly the point -- [Mach is] just a kernel.andP;  The Machkernel gives you three things at a very-low level: virtual memory management,multitasking with multiple thread support and interprocess communication.andM;PC Week: Doesn't Unix gives you virtual memory and multitasking?andM;Tevanian: Mach's virtual-memory management is much more sophisticated andlets you do things that Unix systems only dream about.andM;Unix gives you multitasking, but Mach gives you multiple threads.andP;  .  .  .  AUnix process consists of several pieces -- the virtual address space, thefile descriptors and the executable code.andM;With Mach, you can take the execution part of it and replicate it, and havemultiple [threads] executing in the same address space, which is actuallylike OS/2 threads.andM;PC Week: Each thread points back to the same file?andM;Tevanian: Essentially, yes.andP;  And all the memory is shared and everything isequally accessible, which makes for low overhead.andM;PC Week: Why is Mach useful on multiprocessor systems?andM;Tevanian: In terms of multiple processors, the ability to do parallelprocessing is the key.andP;  The two things you have to worry about are, one, theoperating-system implementation has to be able to run in parallel, so you getuse of all the processors, and, two, you have to make it possible forapplication programmers to build parallel applications.andM;People who have done multiprocessor Unix systems always forget about thesecond one.andP;  They go in and they go to great effort to make Unix run inparallel.andP;  They forget about the poor programmer who has to make his or herprogram run in parallel as well.andP;  And that's where Mach is actually verystrong, because things are tuned more toward the [application] programmerwhere the real software happens.andM;PC Week: Why did NeXT pick the Unix and Mach combination?andM;Tevanian: Everyone understands there are good reasons for multitasking -- itmakes it easier to program, it lets you do multiple things at one time, etc.andO;.  .  .  That's what the Unix world has been good at, except when you try andmerge fast user interfaces with multitasking.andP;  .  .  .  With window systemslike X you don't have enough round-trip performance between applications andthe window system.andP;  Using Mach, we don't make these sacrifices -- no othermultitasking computer can do what we can do with animation and soundsimultaneously.andM;PC Week: Will Mach make additional inroads outside academia?andM;Tevanian: I think people need to realize they can't just dismiss it as aresearch operating system.andP;  .  .  .  The channel is there now, and it'smoving.andP;  You don't go out and buy [ATandamp;T] System V release 3.0 atBusinessland.andM;If the question is whether it's just going to be this interesting researchsystem or something that's really commercially viable, it's going to be thelatter.andM;Because of its technical merits, other people doing other systems are goingto be interested in its features.andP;  Whether they use Mach directly or not isseparate from whether or not Mach is successful.andM;I think if some people don't use Mach directly, they will still implementthose features that Mach implements.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
