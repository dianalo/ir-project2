Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> COO SGP </CO><IN> TNM PHA </IN><TEXT>   Cooper Cos., strapped for cash and facing a roadblock in its efforts to sell a unit, said it intends to seek a buyer for the company.    The Palo Alto, Calif.-based maker of health-care products said it will try to sell the concern either as a whole or in segments. Cooper &quot;is willing to consider bids for any of its businesses from any third party . . . including management-organized leveraged buy-out proposals,&quot; the company said.    Cooper said it plans to retain at least one investment banking firm to assist it in the transactions, as well as to evaluate &quot;other alternatives&quot; that may be open to management.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Cooper shares closed up $2.125 at $14.75 on volume of 1.3 million shares.    The Federal Trade Commission last week voted to ask a court to block Cooper's proposed $150 million sale of its contact-lens business to a unit of Schering-Plough Corp. Because both Cooper and the Schering-Plough unit are major producers of soft contact lenses, the commission said it feared the planned sale &quot;could significantly reduce competition&quot; in the industry.    If the lens deal is scotched, it also could cloud another planned transaction between the two companies. Schering-Plough had also previously agreed to buy Cooper's contact-lens solutions business for about $63 million, contingent on completion of the contact-lens purchase.    The planned sales were part a makeover effort by Cooper's chairman, Parker G. Montgomery, who has said he wants to move the company out of its &quot;mature&quot; eye care businesses to focus on medical diagnostics. Funds from the sales had been earmarked to help pay down the company's heavy debt load, a substantial amount of which is in short-term obligations.    The optometric lines were expected to garner about $300 million. But to date only about $83 million worth of sales have closed, and the $213 million expected this spring from the Schering-Plough deals now appears to be in question.    A Cooper spokesman said he was unaware of any current offers for the company. He added that he thinks the company is presently in compliance with all its debt covenants. Asked if Cooper foresees any difficulty in remaining in compliance in the near future, however, he declined to comment.    This isn't the first time Cooper's chairman has cut a deal, only to be frustrated by federal regulators. In 1984, antitrust concerns caused the U.S. to squelch a potentially lucrative sale of the company -- then known as CooperVision -- to Nestle S.A.    His rapid-fire deal-making and ability to grow small health-products concerns into smooth-running operations that sold for hefty profits once gave Mr. Montgomery a substantial following on Wall Street. But investors have been unhappy with his management style for more than a year, and the company's stock has been depressed for some time.    In the first quarter ended Jan. 31, Cooper had a net loss of $22.2 million on sales of $227.3 million. The net figure included a $9 million charge from the sale of operations, partially offset by a $3.1 million tax credit.    Besides its optometric and medical diagnostic operations, Cooper has a line of surgical products. </TEXT></DOC>
