Unless he resigns, Judge Aguilar faces probableimpeachment and removal from office by Congress if eithercount is upheld on appeal. He would be the fourth federaljudge forced from the bench in the last decade for allegedcriminal wrongdoing.</LP><TEXT>   The San Francisco jury acquitted the 59-year-old JudgeAguilar on three other counts, including a charge that heattempted to influence another Northern California federaljudge in the handling of a case. For each of his convictions,he could be sentenced to five years in prison.   His attorney, Paul Meltzer, of Santa Cruz, Calif., said hebelieved an appeal was likely, but added, &quot;I think that thisis probably the end of a long and distinguished career on thebench.&quot; Mr. Meltzer asserted that the judge had been clearedof the &quot;core charges&quot; against him. Judge Aguilar couldn't bereached for comment.   A Justice Department prosecutor on the case couldn't bereached.   The trial was the second for Judge Aguilar and involvedscaled-down allegations. In the first trial, prosecutorsaccused the judge of using his office as a &quot;racketeeringenterprise.&quot; Federal prosecutors dropped that charge after amistrial on that and six other charges in March. JudgeAguilar had been the first federal judge ever charged withviolating the federal anti-racketeering statute. In the Marchtrial he was aquitted of an obstruction of justice count.   Judge Aguilar was convicted of disclosing to ex-mobsterAbe Chapman that Mr. Chapman was the subject of a federalwiretap, which Judge Aguilar had learned about from a fellowjudge. The judge denied intentionally tipping off Mr.Chapman, who at the time was a relative by marriage.   He was also convicted of attempting to obstruct a grandjury investigation by lying to the FBI about his knowledge ofthe wiretap and about his involvement in an attempt by formerTeamster leader Rudy Tham to overturn a 1980 embezzlementconviction. Mr. Tham and Mr. Chapman were friends.   Judge Aguilar was acquitted of conspiring to influence thefederal judge who was handling the Tham case, Stanley Weigel.Judges Aguilar and Weigel testified that Judge Aguilar askedJudge Weigel several times about the status of the case butdidn't attempt to influence its outcome.   Judge Aguilar was appointed by President Carter in 1980.His supporters have asserted that the government's caseagainst him was a Republican political vendetta in responseto decisions he made that were unfavorable to prosecutors.   ---   SEC CHARGES five lawyers with insider trading.   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged fivemembers of a Michigan law firm with insider trading in thestock of Zenith Laboratories Inc. in May 1988, shortly beforethe company announced plans to seek federal bankruptcyprotection.   The suit names Saul Bluestone, Joseph Bartnick, AlbertLopatin, Sheldon Miller, and Norman Rosen, all partners inthe Detroit law firm of Lopatin, Miller, Freedman, Bluestone,Ehrlich, Rosen andamp; Bartnick.   The suit alleges that in May 1988, Mr. Bluestone learned,by virtue of his position as a member of Zenith's board, thatthe firm had authorized its president to file a bankruptcycourt petition. On the morning of May 2, the SEC said, Mr.Bluestone called his bank, where his Zenith stock was pledgedas collateral for personal loans, and instructed his bankerto sell 50,000 shares of Zenith common stock for at least $2a share.   The complaint alleges that Mr. Bluestone passed on theinformation about Zenith to Mr. Bartnick, and that either Mr.Bluestone or Mr. Bartnick shared the information with Mr.Lopatin, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Miller.   As a result, Mr. Bartnick, Mr. Lopatin, Mr. Miller and Mr.Rosen sold 22,500, 14,668, 16,000 and 6,000 Zenith shares,respectively, at about $2 a share, the SEC alleges.   On May 4, Zenith announced it was filing for bankruptcyprotection, the SEC said. The price of Zenith shares declinedto a close of $1.125 on that day.   Without admitting or denying the charges, Mr. Bluestone,Mr. Bartnick and Mr. Rosen consented to the entry of a finaljudgment enjoining them from further violations of thesecurities laws and ordering them to give back the lossesthey allegedly avoided of $42,167, $17,796, and $4,617,respectively.   The order also directs the three to pay civil penaltiesequal to the amount of the losses allegedly avoided, anddirected Mr. Bluestone and Mr. Bartnick to pay additionalpenalties equal to the losses avoided by the individuals theytipped off to Zenith's announcement.   The SEC said litigation against Mr. Lopatin and Mr. Milleris continuing. The commission said it is seeking injunctionsagainst the two, disgorgement of losses avoided of $11,563and $10,753, and civil penalties.   ---   BATTLE IS BREWING over regulation of lawyers in Texas.   The staff of a legislative advisory panel stirred acontroversy by making recommendations that could strip theState Bar of Texas of its policing powers. Currently, Texasis one of 34 states that authorize the bar to regulate thelegal profession -- by administering attorney discipline, forexample.   But the staff of the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission isproposing changes that would include the creation of anindependent state agency to police attorneys, leaving the barto operate more as a trade association. &quot;Separating theregulatory and association functions would provide an `armslength' distance between the interests of the profession andthose of the state,&quot; a recent staff report said.   Among the staff's other recommendations: Requiring publicdisclosure of all final disciplinary actions against Texasattorneys. Under current rules, many such actions are madepublic, but confidential reprimands are permitted.   The staff report was submitted to the full SunsetCommission, a group of legislators and private citizenscharged with periodic reviews of various agencies. LastFriday, the commission conducted public hearings on whetherthe system of regulating Texas attorneys should be revamped.Its final recommendations will be submitted to the TexasLegislature, which will convene in regular session inJanuary.   In a lengthy report submitted to the commission on Friday,the State Bar of Texas challenged most the Sunset staff'sproposals. It argued, for example, that the recommendationfor an independent regulatory agency &quot;is not supported byfact or good policy.&quot;   ---   HOUSTON FIRM parcels $100 million contingency fee amongall employees.   Vinson andamp; Elkins received the fee from a $350 millionsettlement reached last April in litigation against Santa FePacific Corp. and its Santa Fe Railway unit. J. EvansAttwell, managing partner of the Houston law firm, said themoney arrived Friday.   Vinson andamp; Elkins's 201 partners got most of the $100million, but bonuses also were paid to the remainder of its1,600 workers. Mr. Attwell said the firm would &quot;normally&quot;reward all employees in cases of this magnitude, although&quot;clearly a case of this magnitude doesn't come along withgreat regularity.&quot; He declined to say how much each partneror any employee received.   Vinson andamp; Elkins had represented a group of companies thatsued Santa Fe and four other railroad companies in 1984,charging them with illegally trying to block a coal slurrypipeline the group wanted to build.   The other four railroads previously had settled their partof the case. Vinson andamp; Elkins's total contingency fees fromthe litigation is believed to be a little less than $200million.   ---   Wade Lambert contributed to this column.</TEXT></DOC>
