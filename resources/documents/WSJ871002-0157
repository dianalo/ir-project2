SafeCard, which provides credit-card protection services, said the pact was ended by &quot;mutual agreement.&quot; Neither company elaborated, except to say that recent changes in the stock market prices of both companies made the original terms &quot;no longer feasible.&quot; The terms, announced in August, called for each of CCC's 9.2 million shares to be exchanged for half a share of SafeCard. Chicago-based CCC provides automobile valuation data to insurance companies.    SafeCard said, &quot;Discussions (with CCC) concerning alternative business combinations and possible joint marketing ventures are continuing.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, SafeCard closed at $11.875 a share, unchanged. CCC closed at $8.375 a share, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
