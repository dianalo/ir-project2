The animals get water wells and police protection from poachers. The foreign tourists who come to photograph the animals get fancy lodges. But the Masai, who were forced to move when their grazing land became a national park, get nothing to aid their difficult transition from a pastoral to an agricultural lifestyle. What they do get is angry, particularly when roaming elephants and buffalo trample their corn and cabbage crops.    &quot;We feel the government cares more about the wildlife than it does about us,&quot; says Daniel Lengesia, a Pentecostal pastor in the Masai area of Namelok, which borders the unfenced Amboseli. &quot;We know they make millions from the park, and we, who must live with the animals, don't get any of it.&quot;    With tourism now Kenya's top foreign-exchange earner, and with wildlife the main tourist draw, the age-old conflict between man and environment has been turned on its head. Elephants are more important than peasants, at least to the state treasury. Which raises a vexing development dilemma: Can a poor country like Kenya, with per-capita annual income of about $360 and an explosive population growth rate of 4% a year, afford to develop wildlife and human life at the same time?    Wildlife officials say they can't afford not to. &quot;If we don't develop tourism, the government won't have the money it needs to run basic services,&quot; says Richard Leakey, director of the Kenya Wildlife Service. &quot;We have to make the link between elephants and health clinics. People must be made to perceive the development of wildlife in economic terms.&quot;    That's asking a lot for Africa. Though the continent is blessed with breathtaking scenery and wildlife that stocks the world's zoos, conservation and tourism have been low priorities in the post-independence era. Development of long-neglected human resources took precedence; money poured into schools, clinics, clean water, housing, roads, and agriculture, as well as airports, government buildings and soccer stadiums. Wildlife, on the other hand, was mainly seen as an impediment to this development, killing cattle, ravaging crops and ruining water systems.    But Kenya's development priorities have been scrambled in the past year as commodity prices slumped and tourism overtook coffee and tea as the main money spinner. Last year, 700,000 visitors -- mainly Germans, British and Americans -- pumped $390 million into the country, which helped the government keep current on its steep foreign-debt payments.    &quot;Twenty-five years down the road from independence, we have to start making new priorities,&quot; says Mr. Leakey, a paleontologist who, along with his parents, Louis and Mary Leakey, advanced the study of human origins. &quot;We must think of the conservation of wildlife, land, water and other resources if we are going to have any future.&quot; He is seeking $100 million for the purpose.    Kenya has a lot of catching up to do. Rampant poaching, in part fostered by government corruption, has reduced Kenya's elephant population to 17,000 from 65,000 in 10 years. And with less than 2% of the wildlife revenue of past years going back into the country's 16 national parks and reserves, the tourism infrastructure, particularly roads in the parks, has deteriorated badly. Meanwhile, lax security for tourists on safari has resulted in attacks by bandits.    Indeed, the U.S. State Department recently warned Americans visiting national parks and other remote areas of Kenya to travel only in groups with a guide from a reputable safari firm or a game ranger. A department advisory said most of the attacks, &quot;some of which resulted in deaths of tourists, have been attributed to heavily armed wildlife poachers.&quot;    Still the government is counting on attracting 1.5 million tourists a year by 1995. Some Kenyan officials regard the elephants, rhinos, lions and cheetahs as the country's most-valued civil servants. By one estimate, the elephants, the main tourist attraction, bring in $50 million a year; that comes to about $3,000 per elephant, or nearly 10 times more than the per-capita human contribution to the economy.    But elephants don't vote, and therein lies the development dilemma. &quot;Members of Parliament often ask, 'So, are animals more important than people now?'&quot; says a former member of Parliament.    Hugh Lamprey, the World Wildlife Fund's regional representative for East and Central Africa, says the fund would like the government to spend a greater portion of its tourism revenue on wildlife conservation. But, he says, &quot;The government badly needs those dollars and deutsche marks for essential things, like education, health, social services, defense and transportation.&quot;    The dilemma was clearly illustrated last month when the Kenyan government, although it needs all the foreign currency it can get, nevertheless torched $3 million worth of elephant tusks confiscated from ivory poachers over the past several years. President Daniel arap Moi, who lit the fire, says Kenya can't take the lead in a world-wide ivory-trade ban if the government is still selling ivory itself.    The Masai of Amboseli believe they know a way to resolve the dilemma. The community leaders have been trying to forge a link between the wildlife and village development by operating a campsite for low-budget tourists inside the park. The more wildlife, the more campers, the more money for farm implements and seed. Similarly, they say, the government needs to spread around its tourist revenue. For starters, the Masai say they could use help with an irrigation system and an electric fence to keep the elephants and water buffalo out of their crops.    &quot;If our people see some benefit from the animals, they will want to protect them,&quot; says David Maitumo, a Masai leader. &quot;But if they don't . . . get any money from the elephants, they will continue to chase them away.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
