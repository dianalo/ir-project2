In defining the N/sub 0/ particlebasis on which N particle states are built as the pair rotational modes,we compare two kinds of approaches, with and without the blocking effect.In the latter to be proposed here, the blocking effect is contained inthe pair rotational mode, together with the exchange effect. The couplingbetween particles and the pair rotation is affected in such a way asto attenuate completely in the single-j limit.</TEXT></DOC>
