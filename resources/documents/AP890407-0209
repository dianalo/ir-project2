He said the money had to be earmarked to ``prevent programdisruption'' for the 10-warhead MX.   The administration is undertaking a review of what mix ofnext-generation missiles to endorse.   The MX missiles would be deployed in rail cars. A rival plan isto switch to single-warhead Midgetman missiles. Or there could besome mix of the two intercontinental ballistic missile systems.   Bush was initially to tell Congress by mid-February which systemhe had selected. However, that deadline was missed and theselection _ which has been debated for the past ten years _postponed while the review of U.S. strategic policy proceeded.   ``I am committed to an open and full review of the ICBMmodernization issue. I am confident the review will provide thebasis for development of consensus on ICBM modernization,'' Bushsaid in a letter to the chairmen of the Senate and House committeeson appropriations and armed services.   Bush said permitting $120 million to be spent on the MX programwould ensure its viability while not endangering the Midgetmanprogram, ``which can proceed without additional funds until thenational security strategy review and amendments to the fiscal year1990-91 budget are completed.''   ``This obligation of additional funds for (the MX) must occur inorder to prevent program disruption, substantial cost increases orsignificant schedule delays,'' Bush said.   Bush said during last year's presidential campaign, ``The realchoice now is to find a possible mix between the two.''   A congressional study last year said that it would cost $13.8billion to build 50 rail-based MX missiles, and about three timesas much for the equivalent 500 Midgetman missiles.   MX proponents cite this cost advantage, while opponents arguethat the 10-warhead MX would be more vulnerable to surprise attacks.</TEXT></DOC>
