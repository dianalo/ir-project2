According to the SEC, any bank offering part of its loan portfolio to Mexico would be obliged to mark that portion of its portfolio down to the price offered, or increase its loan-loss reserves.    In issuing the statement, the SEC indicated that it intends to apply generally accepted accounting principles to the Mexican debt program. Under those principles, banks are required to mark to market assets they intend to sell.    The debt-swap plan was devised by the Mexican government and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and announced last week by the Treasury Department. Under the plan, Mexico will offer commercial banks an opportunity to swap, at a discount, a portion of their loans to Mexico in return for as much as $10 billion in new, marketable Mexican securities. These securities would be backed by 20-year, zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds, but at no cost to the American taxpayer.    Accountants and bankers had a variety of views of the SEC statement yesterday, with some contending it will increase the general pressure on banks to mark loans down to market value, and others saying it leaves banks an escape valve, in that it requires them to increase loan loss allowances &quot;as necessary.&quot; In addition, observed Mike Moran, a banking partner at Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co., it isn't clear how much pressure banking regulators will exert to ensure that banks take account of the SEC opinion.    SEC accounting staff bulletins such as the statement issued yesterday don't officially carry the weight of law, but accountants and their clients are required to adhere to the guidelines set forth in the bulletins or face SEC action.    There was general agreement that the SEC statement could have lasting significance. &quot;It's a fairly important document, because this may well be a precedent-setting transaction,&quot; said J. Thomas Macy, a banking specialist at Price Waterhouse andamp; Co., which audits J.P. Morgan's accounts and has advised Morgan on the debt-swap program.    Morgan, whose main unit is Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., seemed satisfied with the SEC opinion, as did its auditors. &quot;Generally the SEC position represents a thoughtful, responsible response to a complex and unusual set of problems,&quot; said Robert Bench, a Price Waterhouse partner who until recently was deputy comptroller of the currency.    However, some large banks seemed to want to take time to mull over the SEC position. A Citicorp spokesman said the bank had no comment to make on it.    James McDermott, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., an investment banking firm specializing in banks, said the SEC statement &quot;is just another step in the direction toward market valuation&quot; of loans.    But Morgan and Price Waterhouse take a much less sweeping view. Both point out that the tendered debt is isolated from the remainder of a portfolio; if a bank tenders part of its Mexican debt, it isn't required to write the rest of its Mexican loans down to that value. &quot;No banking system in the world has a mark-to-market system for its loans,&quot; said Price Waterhouse's Mr. Bench. A bank must mark a loan to market value only if it doesn't intend to hold the loan to maturity, he noted, adding, &quot;There's no contagion.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
