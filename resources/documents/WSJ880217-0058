Donnelly, a 28-year-old former stock-index futures trader, pleaded guilty, as expected, to two counts of defrauding his former employer out of more than $1 million.    Mr. Donnelly was one of 10 individuals charged by the U.S. attorney here last week with criminal violations of the commodity laws in a renewed crackdown by the Justice Department on futures trading fraud.    Mr. Donnelly faces a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a $1 million fine. Sentencing is scheduled for April 7. His lawyer, William Phelan, declined to comment on the guilty plea, and said Mr. Donnelly wasn't available for comment.    As previously reported, between early 1984 and July 1986 Mr. Donnelly diverted stock-index futures trading profits that belonged to his employer, CRT Services Inc., into accounts that he controlled with a handful of other stock-index futures traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
