Roh pledged a major shuffle of the government and governingDemocratic Justice Party and a revision of undemocratic laws toprevent more abuses.   But opponents immediately rejected Roh's appeal and said Chunmust fully account for abuses during his seven-year term. Both majoropposition parties called for a full investigation.   Thousands of dissidents and radical students braved freezingtemperatures and staged street protests in Seoul to demand that Chunbe arrested and punished.   Students hurling firebombs and rocks clashed with riot police incentral Seoul. Police armored vans fired volleys of tear gas todrive back students.   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan. Punish Roh Tae-woo,'' protesters yelled.   KBS, the state broadcasting system, said about 5,000 people tookpart in the protests. Thousands of riot police blocked the studentsas they tried to march through the center of the city.   Police had no immediate word on injuries or arrests. Severalpolice officers were set on fire by firebombs.   Roh stopped short of granting Chun a pardon, but he said anyprosecution of the former ruler would be unfair politicalretribution.   ``When he himself apologized deeply, how can we stone the formerpresident alone on the grounds that there were many mistakes in thepast?'' Roh said.   Chun, a former general who took power with military backing in1980, went into internal exile Wednesday after apologizing to thenation for corruption and other abuses under his government. Hestepped down in February at the end of a seven-year term.   Chun said he took full responsibility for misdeeds under hisgovernment. He said he was surrendering all his property, includingabout $24 million, in efforts to atone.   Chun, living in a remote Buddhist monastery on the east coast,listened to Roh's speech on radio but had no comment, an aide said.   Roh, a former general and once close ally of Chun, is trying todefuse public anger against Chun without damaging his ownadministration.   The Roh government is closely identified with Chun'sadministration. The president took office in February after a splitin the opposition enabled him to win elections in December.   Roh said the government would take the lead in exposing pastabuses and a special unit would be set up for that purpose. But healso said he wanted the sensational hearings by the NationalAssembly into Chun's government to end by the end of the year.   The hearings have galvanized South Korea and helped fuelanti-government protests.   Roh said he would grant amnesty to political prisoners jailedunder Chun and restore the civil rights of those already freed. Hesaid ``generosity'' would be shown to opponents arrested under hisgovernment.   Government officials said the cases of 266 prisoners convicted ofpolitical offenses or facing trial were being reviewed and as manyas possible would be freed around Dec. 10. Opposition partiescontend about 1,000 political prisoners are held.   Roh also promised compensation for victims of the 1980 uprisingin the southern city of Kwangju, which was suppressed by the armywith the deaths of about 200 people. He also promised compensationand exoneration for people killed or dismissed for political reasonsunder Chun.   He said political party funds would be put under open supervisionto prevent abuses, officials and politicians would not be allowed toforce businesses to make political contributions, special favors forbusinesses would be ended, and undemocratic laws would be revised orremoved, including the harsh national security laws.   Chun has denied any personal corruption, but some of hisassociates and relatives have been convicted or charged withmisappropriating millions of dollars in government funds. Many ofthe charges involve raising secret political funds, often by forcingbusinesses to make donations.   Roh said he would enforce law and order and said the violentactivities of radical students and labor activists will not betolerated.   Radical students and dissidents calling for the arrest of Chunhave clashed several times with riot police in Seoul and othercities in recent days. The radicals contend Roh is a continued frontfor military rule and have called for his fall.</TEXT></DOC>
