That U.S. deficit was narrower than the year-earlier gap of C$1.72 billion.    U.S. imports of Canadian autos, parts, tires and tubes rose 4.1% in the quarter to C$9.12 billion from C$8.76 billion. U.S. exports to Canada rose 7.7% to C$7.58 billion from C$7.04 billion.    Statistics Canada attributed the narrower U.S. deficit partly to an 8.6% rise in Canadian imports of U.S. parts. </TEXT></DOC>
