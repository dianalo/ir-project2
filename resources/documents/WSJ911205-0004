While any broad effect of the law has been foiled by arecent rash of drug-related violence in the nation's capital,the statute nevertheless has likely prevented an average of47 deaths annually, researchers maintain.</LP><TEXT>   The report, by University of Maryland researchers, foundthat average monthly deaths from gunfire in the city droppedabout 25% after the law went into effect in 1976. They foundno similar reductions in murders or suicides from othercauses, or in gun-related deaths in nearby communities thatdidn't have gun control laws.   &quot;The {law's} effect occurs for both suicides andhomicides,&quot; says Colin Loftin, professor at the university'sInstitute of Criminal Justice and Criminology. &quot;It occurs inboth only for firearms, and only in the district, not inadjacent communities. We think it's as strong a case asyou're going to find.&quot;   The National Rifle Association, an ardent foe of guncontrol, said murder rates in the city have long comparedunfavorably with national trends and characterized the reportas &quot;pure science fiction.&quot;   The study, which appears in today's New England Journal ofMedicine, covers nearly two decades ending in 1987 -- beforethe recent gang and drug-related killings that havecatapulted Washington's murder rate to among the highest inthe U.S.   &quot;People who need guns to carry on their criminalenterprises have found ways to circumvent the law,&quot; saysPhilip J. Cook, a public policy professor at Duke University.But he said the law may have reduced suicides as well asgun-related deaths from such incidents as barroom brawls andfamily arguments.   The Washington law prohibits the purchase, sale andpossession of handguns by civilians, although residents whoowned guns when the law became effective were allowed toregister and keep them. Rifles and shotguns may be purchased,subject to restrictions and registration.   Firearms accounted for nearly 33,000 deaths in the U.S. in1987, including 18,000 suicides and 12,665 homicides. Guncontrol advocates have met stiff resistence, especially fromthe NRA, in pushing for legislation to regulate firearms.   Dr. Loftin and his colleagues found that gun-relatedhomicides in the city averaged 13 a month in the eight yearsprior to adoption of the law, and 9.7 a month from 1977 to1987, a 25% drop. Suicides in which guns were used fell 23%.During the same periods, homicides and suicides that didn'tinvolve handguns fell slightly; gun-related homicides innearby counties in Maryland and Virginia, where no gun lawswere in effect, fell 7% after the Washington law was passed,while gun-related suicides increased 12%. The data didn'tdifferentiate between handguns and rifles or shotguns.   The authors said no reason other than the law couldexplain the decline in gun-related deaths in Washington. Dr.Loftin said the results need to be replicated in a study ofanother city before it was safe to generalize about theeffect of such laws.   Paul Blackman, the NRA's research coordinator, maintainedthat the Maryland researchers &quot;phonied the data&quot; by, amongother things, falsely inflating numbers for the years priorto the law's passage. In 1976, the homicide rate inWashington was 26.9 per 100,000 people, and it has fallenbelow that level in only one year since, he said.   In an editorial accompanying the study, Jerome P.Kassirer, editor of the journal, called upon doctors to speakout for gun control, much as they have in anti-smokingcampaigns. &quot;The death rate from guns has long been a nationaldisgrace,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
