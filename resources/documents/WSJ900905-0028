The satellite, launched March 14 from a Martin MariettaTitan III rocket, ended up in a useless orbit after thesystem that separated the satellite from the rocketmalfunctioned. Martin Marietta later blamed the trouble on a&quot;wiring problem, undetected by the processes and testprocedures used in pre-launch checkout.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The original claim by Martin Marietta and the counterclaimare an important test of satellite launch contracts. MartinMarietta said in its complaint that if its contract can't beenforced, the company will have to boost the price of itsTitan III launches, which could make its commercial launchbusiness uncompetitive.   Intelsat, an international consortium, argued that MartinMarietta failed to live up to its contractual obligation andthat slip-ups by the company's management and employeesresulted in the launch failure.   The claim, filed in federal court in Baltimore Friday,responds to a complaint filed July 6 by Martin Marietta. Thegiant defense contractor, anticipating a lawsuit fromIntelsat, asked the court for a ruling that under the launchcontract, Intelsat assumed the risk of loss of its satellite.Intelsat, it said, was offered insurance against a launchfailure, but decided against buying it.</TEXT></DOC>
