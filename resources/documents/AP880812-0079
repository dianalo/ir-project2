Botha saidtoday that a tough sanctions bill passed by the U.S. House ofRepresentatives will not help South African blacks and might deraila regional peace initiative.   ``The recklessness of members of Congress who do not care in theleast whether their actions adversely affect the search for apeaceful solution to the problems of southern Africa as a whole isastounding,'' Botha said.   He said the legislation, which was forwarded to the Senate aftera vote Thursday night, might ``obstruct or make impossible'' anongoing initiative to end South Africa's 73-year rule overSouth-West Africa, also known as Namibia.   The sanctions bill, which still needs Senate approval andPresident Reagan's signature to become law, would halt U.S.investment in South Africa and impose a near-total trade embargo.It was approved by the House 244-132, with most Democratssupporting it and most Republicans opposing it.   The bill faces a possible Republican filibuster in the Senateand a likely veto by Reagan. Earlier legislation, which passeddespite Reagan's veto, bars imports of various South Africancommodities and forbids South African planes to land at U.S.airports.   Botha said in a statement that the pending bill was beingdebated ``for purely internal political aims.''   ``It (the bill) has no bearing on the promotion of the interestsof black people in South Africa,'' he said. ``The members of theHouse of Representatives are by now fully aware that prominentblack leaders in South Africa, as well as governments in certainneighboring states, strongly oppose this legislation.''   Prominent black anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa,including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have urged the West toimpose tougher sanctions as a means of pressuring the government togrant full political rights to the black majority. Under Pretoria'spolicy of apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no votein national affairs.   Many black moderates and conservatives, as well as severalprominent white liberals, have supported Pretoria's contention thatsanctions will have the harshest effect on blacks and will hardenthe white minority's resistance to political change.   Botha said he found it ``particularly remarkable'' that theHouse acted on the bill ``exactly at a time when positive progresswas being made with the peace negotiations between South Africa,Cuba and Angola.''   The three countries on Monday announced a cease-fire in the13-year Angolan war. South Africa said it was prepared to startgranting independence to Namibia Nov. 1 as part of a U.N. plan,provided an agreement was reached later this month on a timetablefor the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.   An estimated 50,000 Cuban troops have been supporting Angola'sMarxist government in its fight against the UNITA rebel movement.UNITA, which is backed by the United States and South Africa, isnot a party to the cease-fire.   ``It would be ironical if (the U.N. independence plan forNamibia) should reach the point of implementation only to beobstructed or made impossible as a result of provisions in theAmerican legislation,'' Botha said. </TEXT></DOC>
