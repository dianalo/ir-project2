Police arrested and beat scoresof protesters.   About 2,500 students holding red and blue banners tried to marchout of Yonsei University to go to the border truce village ofPanmunjom, about 30 miles away.   Hundreds of riot troopers in green combat fatigues andblack-visored helmets confronted students as soon as they exitedthe main gate.   Some officers were seen beating students with riot shields andmaking flkying karate kicks at fleeing protesters.   The students did not fight back and most were unarmed except fora few carrying clubs. Some students hurled a few stones, but theprotesters only fought back with clubs and rocks when the policecharged into the campus.   Dozens of students seized by police huddled on the ground,clinging to each other as police hit and kicked them. Some studentscried with pain and senior police officers hit some of their owntroopers to try and stop the beating.   The students made three atrempts to march out of the main gate.Each time, they were driven back by charging police and armoredvans firing tear gas.   The students marched out after a rally to call for reunificationwith communist North Korea. They wanted to go to Panmunjom fortalks with North Korean student delegates on reuniting the dividedKorean pensinsula.   The government banned the march and deployed more than 20,000riot police to stop it.   On Sunday, hundreds of students at Yonsei and another college incentral Seoul battled riot police with firebombs and rocks, andfurious residents demanded a halt to the protests to protect theOlympics.   Fewer students appeared to be involved than in clashes onSaturday. The few thousand radicals involved in the protests havevirtually no public support and clashes were confined to two orthree small areas.   Students tried to stage a number of demonstrations in downtownSeoul, but handfuls of protesters were dispersed quickly byhundreds of riot police. Police said more than 5,000 riot troopswere deployed to block the protests.   National Police Headquarters said hundreds of people werearrested, but it had no overall figures. Officials said 1,027protesters were arrested in clashes Saturday and 63 troopersinjured, most in clashes around Yonsei.   Police halted and searched students entering or leaving Yonseion Sunday. Dozens of students were arrested and troops were seenbeating and kicking some detainees.   Angry residents and shopkeepers staged several counter-proteststo demand that students stop violent demonstrations. Onlookersheckled student demonstrators in the city. ``No firebombs bystudents,'' they shouted.   About 200 residents went to the main gate of Yonsei Sunday todemand students end the protest, but the students refused.   Citizens also argued with protesters near the city's MyondongCathedral, accusing them of sabotaging the Summer Olympicsscheduled to begin in Seoul Sept. 17. People told the studentstheir protests embarrassed the nation.   A column of about 1,000 people who said they belonged to thepreviously unknown ``Youth League for Protection of the Nation''staged a march in central Seoul, chanting: ``Successful Olympicsand economic development.'' Dozens of onlookers applauded.   Students attacked some of the group's marchers with sticks androcks near Seoul National University Medical School before beingdriven off by police.   President Roh Tae-woo warned Friday that violent protests were athreat to the Olympics and had to be stopped.   Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to tryto mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. Theradicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have failed togain support because of violent tactics and open advances to thecommunist north.   The students say they are not communists but insist thepeninsula be reunited immediately, with political differences to beworked out later. Most South Koreans fear the north is determinedto conquer them.   The radical students also demand removal of the 42,000 U.S.troops in South Korea.   The Korean peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end ofWorld War II. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start theKorean War.</TEXT></DOC>
