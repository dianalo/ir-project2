The chemical concern's disclosure follows the recentpublication of a scientific study that identified theproduction of nitrous oxide in nylon making as the firstknown industrial source of the naturally occurring gas.Because the gas depletes protective ozone in the atmosphere,the study has focused environmentalists' attention on theestimated 750,000 tons of the gas -- commonly called laughinggas -- that nylon producers release annually into the air.</LP><TEXT>   Du Pont, the world's largest nylon maker, said itcurrently removes about half the nitrous oxide generatedduring production through a combustion process used toeliminate more-conventional pollutants. But applying thatsystem throughout all its plants would entail technicalproblems and require a &quot;significant investment,&quot; a spokesmansaid; while doing so is feasible, he said, the expenditurewould be &quot;wasted,&quot; given the superior technology Du Pont isnow fine-tuning.   Citing patent concerns, the spokesman declined to providespecifics, but said that the new technology will &quot;recyclethis nitrous oxide back into the {manufacturing} process,&quot;and thus save both energy and materials. The company iscurrently starting a one-year pilot program on the process inTexas, he noted.   While it had already undertaken development of the newprocess, Du Pont said, the recent study &quot;raised ourawareness&quot; of the nitrous oxide issue.</TEXT></DOC>
