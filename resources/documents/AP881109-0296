The toll included 39 deaths reported Wednesday and governmentofficials said tens of thousands of people remained homeless.Authorities said they expected the toll to rise as communicationsare restored to stricken areas.   The government weather service downgraded Skip to a tropicalstorm Wednesday as it moved farther into the South China Sea towardVietnam. A weather bulletin said the storm's top winds had weakenedto 69 mph.   The government's Office of Civil Defense said the latest deathsreported were from the island of Tablas, which was in the path ofSkip as it hammered the central Philippines Monday and Tuesday withheavy rains and winds up to 110 mph.   Nick Garcia, a civil defense spokesman, said a fatality reportreceived via military radio from Tablas did not say how the 39 died.The report said all roads on the island, 160 miles south of Manila,were impassable, Garcia added.   Earlier, reports from the civil defense office and the PhilippineRed Cross indicated that the hardest hit area was Palawan island,where 36 people were killed in widespread flooding. At least 70others were reported missing on the island.   Also hard hit was Camarines Sur province on southeastern Luzon,where landslides and tornadoes killed 26 people, including 20 in anavalanche that hit Pasacao, a community 160 miles southeast ofManila. Thirteen other people were listed as missing in thatavalanche, they said.   At least 13 people drowned in three Manila suburbs flooded by therain-swollen lake Laguna de Bay, officials said.   Fifteen deaths reported were on the islands of Panay, Cebu,Marinduque and Mindanao.   The Social Services Department reported at least 1 million peoplewere affected by Skip, meaning their homes or property weredestroyed or damaged. The Office of Civil Defense said more than70,000 people were homeless.   Skip was the 20th cyclone to hit the Philippines this year andthe third since Typhoon Ruby ravaged virtually the entire countryduring the last week of October.   Officials said Typhoon Ruby killed 181 people on land, and atleast 64 others perished in the sinking of the passenger ship DonaMarilyn. More than 200 others were reported missing and presumeddead in the sinking.   Officials said Tropical Storm Tess, which swept through theVisayas Islands on Saturday, caused floods that killed 11 people.
