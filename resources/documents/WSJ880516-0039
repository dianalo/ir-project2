The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for cars was 7.6 million, up slightly from the late April pace, according to a U.S. Commerce Department formula. The returns gave domestic auto makers further confidence that the 1988 market will stay even with last year's healthy market.    The eight domestic auto makers saw sales of North American-made cars rise in the first 10 days of May to 204,270 cars, a 35.2% increase from the 151,131 sold in the year-earlier period. North American-made light truck sales totaled 113,899, up 38.5% from the 82,229 of a year earlier. Total vehicle sales were 318,169, a 36.3% increase from the 1987 period's 233,360.    Analysts said, however, that the year-over-year comparison didn't mean much. Last year, early May sales were hurt because consumer incentive programs ended April 30. This year, the auto makers scaled back rebates May 11, persuading some consumers to purchase before then.    The impending cut in incentives &quot;brought in a few more people,&quot; said Philip Olinski, assistant sales manager of Loren Buick in Glenview, Ill. &quot;We showed them the old rebates are going to be ending May 11. (The company) then took $250 away.&quot; Rebates on Buick Electras, Le Sabres and Centuries all dropped to $500 from $750.    Sales were strong across virtually all manufacturers' lines. General Motors Corp.'s car and truck sales rose 36.1%, Ford Motor Co.'s 33.1%, and Chrysler Corp.'s 44.2%. Chrysler was coming off a very weak year-earlier period, during which it had limited availability of its bread-and-butter Omni and Horizon subcompacts because of a temporary halt in production.    GM's sales vice president, C.N. &quot;Bud&quot; Moore, said in a prepared statement that &quot;acceptance of GM's 1988 products and economic factors remain favorable and the momentum should continue.&quot;    The Japanese manufacturers in early May also enjoyed stronger business from their U.S. plants. Even Nissan Motor Co., whose car sales are down in the U.S. this year, saw car sales rise for the second 10-day period in a row. Only Volkswagen AG, whose poor performance will force the closing of its only U.S. plant later this year, saw sales drop.    ---   Ella Newsome contributed to this article.    ---            RETAIL U.S. CAR AND LIGHT TRUCK SALES-a                                  1988       1987      x-%                                May 1-10   May 1-10    Chg.
