A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).Agrecetus, of Middleton, Wisconsin, has submitted an application for apermit for release into the environment, to field test genetically engineeredcotton (<T3>Gossipium hirsutum </T3>L.) plants modified to express the delta-endotoxinprotein from the soil bacterium <T3>Bacillus thuringiensis.</T3>In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the cotton plant under the conditions describedin the Agrecetus application. APHIS concluded that the field testing willnot present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination and willnot have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Agrecetus, as well as a review of otherrelevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' reviewand analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting thefield testing.The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene encoding delta-endotoxin from <T3>B. thuringiensis </T3>subsp. <T3>kurstaki </T3>has been inserted into the cotton chromosome. The expressionof the truncated delta-endotoxin polypeptide results in a certain degreeof protection against the feeding damage caused by the larvae of selectlepidopteran insects. In nature, chromosomal genetic material in cottonplants can only be transferred to other sexually compatible plants by cross-pollination.In this field trial, the introduced gene in cotton plants cannot spreadto other plants by cross-pollination because the field test plots are locatedat a sufficient distance from any sexually compatible plant. No other cottonplants are being cultivated in the entire county where the test plots arelocated.2. Neither the delta-endotoxin gene, nor its gene product confer any plantpest characteristic on cotton plants.3. <T3>B. thuringiensis </T3>subsp. <T3>kurstaki </T3>from which the delta-endotoxin gene was isolated is nota plant pest and is widely distributed in the environment as a soil inhabitant.4. The vector (disarmed Ti-plasmid DNA) used to transfer the delta-endoxingene to cotton plants has been evaluated for its use in this specific experimentand does not pose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, althoughderived from a DNA sequence of a known plant pest (<T3>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</T3>), has been disarmed; that is, genesthat are necessary for producing plant disease (phytohormone genes) havebeen deleted from the vector. The vector has been tested and shown to benonpathogenic to susceptible plants.5. The vector agent is a soil bacterium, <T3>A. tumefaciens,</T3> which was used to deliver the vector DNA and thedelta-endotoxin gene into the cotton plant cells in tissue culture. Ithas been eradicated by the use of appropriate antibiotics to which thebacterium is sensitive.6. The vector acts by delivering and inserting the gene into the cottongenome (i.e., chromosomal DNA). The vector does not survive in the transformedplants. No natural mechanism for horizontal movement within the genomeof the cotton plant and gene transfer from the transgenic cotton plantis known to exist for a stably inserted gene.7. The toxic polypeptide produced by the introduced gene is called delta-endotoxin.Upon ingestion, the toxin kills select lepidopteran insects. Delta-endotoxinis not toxic to insects other than the targeted lepidopteran larvae, wildor domestic birds, fish or mammals, and humans. Because of its safety,its topical application on vegetable crops is permitted up to harvest date.8. The field test will consist of a series of 40-foot-long rows in a splitplot arrangement with rows spaced 38 inches apart. The total area of thetest site will be 2 acres and will be physically isolated. The plot hasgood security.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 3d day of May 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
