Although she could not walk, Bulgarian officials gave her a passport and forcibly deported her from her home in Cuma, then denied her admittance to a Bulgarian first aid station a few yards from the border. A Turkish ambulance arrives to take her to a hospital in nearby Edirne. &quot;At least,&quot; announces Mrs. Nazimeye, &quot;she can die knowing she is home.&quot;    The old lady is one of nearly 200,000 Turkish Bulgarians who, until three months ago, resided in the small farming and industrial towns of southern and eastern Bulgaria. Then that country's communist government began deporting them by the thousands. One senior Turkish foreign affairs official suggests the Bulgarian government, alarmed at the continued population growth of a Turkish minority that now makes up 10% of the Bulgarian population and at the failure of its campaign of forced assimilation, is trying to avoid a repeat of ethnic unrest that is confronting the Soviets. They have been coming at a rate of about 4,000 refugees a day for weeks now. No one knows how many of the more than 1 million of Bulgaria's Turkish minority will eventually be forced to leave.    The political ramifications of this exodus are potentially explosive. Turkish intelligence reports more than two months of rioting in parts of southern Bulgaria. Refugees report they have witnessed Bulgarian military personnel using a gas that left the bodies of protesters unmoving on the ground. Stories -- unconfirmed but too numerous to discount -- suggest that however harrowing life might be for those Turks being driven out of their Bulgarian homes it is vastly worse for those left behind.    &quot;The people are being persecuted for being Turkish and for being Muslim,&quot; says one Turkish journalist, Altemur Kilic, over lunch.    The story goes back several years to the early 1980s when the Bulgarian government began a major campaign of forced assimilation. The Turkish language was banned, as was Turkish music and dance. Turks were forbidden to circumcise their baby boys or to practice Islam. Mrs. Nazimeye -- her name in Bulgaria was changed to Nevena -- says that soldiers with &quot;big guns and dogs&quot; entered her town several weeks ago. &quot;They were hitting us with the guns and letting the dogs attack us. They just kept hitting us.&quot; Her town had more than 200 houses -- now maybe 10 are inhabited. Her companion, Mrs. Hulya, shows me bite marks on her arms and legs from the dog attacks. Her daughter and two sons, all in their late 20s, were not allowed to leave the country. They were put to work in the cotton and tobacco fields.    Mass protests were frequent in 1985 and 1986 and continue today. It was at one of these protests in the town of Kurcali that Besin Haliloglu was arrested and sent to a work camp. He had refused to accept the Bulgarian name given to him, Byon Hiristo. For protesting he now bears on his wrist prison identification number 1986. He was released from the camp several days before being told to leave the country. Police would not give him a passport, and he was not allowed to bring his family or his belongings. Mr. Haliloglu made quite a scene at the border when he made a desperate dash to the Turkish side without any identification. Once free he was met with wariness from Turkish officials who'd reportedly caught several Bulgarian infiltrators at the border. Neighbors from Kurcali eventually vouched for him.    The mayor of Edirne, Unal Erkan, has heard hundreds of such stories, as he visits the camp daily, arriving in the afternoon, flags flying from the fenders of his Mercedes. As tea is served, a young girl tells of being ordered out of her family home in Bulgaria and being brought to the police station. There she waited in line for more than eight hours for a passport -- only to be sent home without one. Soon after, police arrived and told her family that it had less than eight hours to leave. The police confiscated her watch and glasses.    She at least is lucky to have gotten out. As Mayor Erkan explains, &quot;Children born between the years of 1971 to 1974 are the last to be allowed out. Young men old enough to enter the army are inducted against their will to work the cotton and tobacco fields. The girls are also put to work. Many of them are forced to run the family farms by themselves.&quot;    He describes the Bulgarian procedure for deportation: &quot;Generally, they split the families up as much as possible. A typical family of six, say, will have the mother and a young son forced to travel by bus to the border, while the father and a young son will go on foot. What belongings they will be allowed to bring may have to be carried by the father, or they will be transported by a bus or train.&quot; The family is never sure when it will be reunited.    Traveling Turks are allowed to bring only enough money to pay for transportation to the border. Their bank accounts are frozen. About 25 miles north of the crossing to Turkey, all expelled Turks must stay for three days at a holding camp, where women and young girls are inoculated. The Bulgarian government has refused to disclose the purpose of the shots, and, the mayor says, World Health Organization officials have looked into the matter but have not been able to determine the shots' effect. The only food available is bread for which the Bulgarians charge 20 Bulgarian lire, though outside the camp fresh bread normally sells for between three and five lire. After the forced holdover, they resume their long walk to the border.    New arrivals to Turkey go through a central check-in at Kapikule. If they have relatives in Turkey, the refugees are immediately sent to their family's district. Those without local contacts are transferred to one of the 14 refugee centers in the country. There, they receive medical attention and can enter their names for the job referral program. Generally, according to the border chief of police, none of the refugees remain longer than a day at the border. The relocation process -- directed from Edirne, rather than from Ankara -- is surprisingly orderly and efficient.    The mayor is proud of the job the people of his town are doing. &quot;If the government were to send the military or the United Nations here, I would take it as a sign that I was not doing a good job,&quot; the mayor observes. &quot;However, I don't think that the United Nations or the International Red Cross has even offered to help us. That is disturbing.&quot; But while the international response to the crisis has been muted, the U.S. has promised $10 million in refugee assistance.    The sun has set, and the human caravan continues across the border. Some individuals celebrate their arrival in Turkey by kissing the soil. Others pack and prepare for the next leg of their journey, one they hope will lead to a life of prosperity as well as freedom. In that regard, they are no different from refugees or immigrants anywhere else. As the mayor is concluding his daily visit, word comes across a staffer's walkie-talkie that one person's journey has ended. The woman whose name didn't matter has died.    ---   Mr. McFadden is on the editorial page staff of The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
