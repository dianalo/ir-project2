MalloyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> MANILA, the Philippines  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The lopsided victory by Corazon Aquino's candidates in last week's congressional election illustrates the popularity of the Philippine president but also signals a sharp decline in her political power.    &quot;From now on, you have a lame-duck president,&quot; says Paul Aquino, who was the campaign manager for the president's ticket and is a brother of her late husband. Mrs. Aquino is limited to one term under the new constitution, and the newly elected legislators won't need to tap her popularity again until the next national election is held in 1992.    Most observers expect the policy-making process to shift from the president's palace to the newly elected Senate. Mr. Aquino says the probable relationship between his sister-in-law and the Senate will resemble that of a chief executive officer and a company's board. But this board is uncommonly divided, and Mrs. Aquino has shown herself reluctant to exert strong leadership, even within her own cabinet. &quot;She waits for proposals rather than taking the initiative,&quot; says Vicente Paterno, an Aquino-backed senatorial candidate who recently served Mrs. Aquino as head of the state-owned oil company.    So it is likely that government policies increasingly will reflect rivalries among a few strong politicians in the 24-member Senate. Unofficial returns suggest the Senate may include as many as 23 candidates endorsed by Mrs. Aquino. But the president's ticket was only a loose coalition of five political parties and a clutch of independents; the same parties fought each other in many contests for the House of Representatives.    &quot;The coalition ended May 12,&quot; says Mr. Aquino, referring to the day after the election. Adds Neptali Gonzales, a senator-elect: &quot;We have diverse views, opposing views. If you want an opposition, you will find it in the candidates of President Aquino.&quot;    Opposing views weren't displayed during the election campaign. Mr. Aquino ran what he called a &quot;Miss Universe contest&quot; in which the president's candidates were pledged to keep quiet about contentious issues. Mr. Paterno, the senatorial candidate, says the candidates haven't discussed future policies among themselves.    Two important issues that divide them are the Philippines' $28 billion foreign debt and the future of the U.S. military bases here. Some of the president's candidates have called for &quot;selective repudiation&quot; of foreign bank loans. And some have agreed with one Aquino candidate, Augusto Sanchez, that the presence of U.S. bases is &quot;degrading&quot; and &quot;colonial.&quot;    The recently adopted Philippine constitution states that the bases can remain only if a formal treaty replaces the U.S.)Philippine military agreement that expires in 1991. The main purpose of this provision is to extract from Washington a regular rent for the bases that can't be changed by the U.S. Congress. Another effect is to make the bases hostage to as few as nine Philippine senators, because two-thirds of the Senate must approve a treaty.    The U.S. rejects the idea of rent because it could tempt allies around the world to seek similar payments. &quot;Rent one place and you'd have to do it everywhere,&quot; a diplomat says.    Currently, the U.S. is paying the Philippine government an in-kind rental fee amounting to $900 million over five years. The payment isn't formally a part of the military agreement and is subject to congressional approval. U.S. military-base accords throughout the rest of the world operate in the same way.    Senators run nationwide in the Philippines, so those who get the most votes become national leaders and contenders for the next presidential election. The most-powerful senators probably will be Jovito Salonga and Mr. Gonzales. They have their own political machines and were among those drawing the most votes in last week's election. Mr. Salonga has spoken strongly against the U.S. bases in the past.    The biggest loser was Juan Ponce Enrile, a swashbuckling former defense minister whose supporters wear T-shirts that call him &quot;Johnny Rambo.&quot; Manila has been jittery for months over the possibility that Mr. Enrile might try to gain power with military help. His ticket was badly beaten, and Philippine soldiers didn't give him any support when he sought to dispute the results by staging a demonstration in front of the armed forces headquarters.    Mr. Enrile may yet prove to have narrowly won a Senate seat when all the votes are counted -- which may take weeks -- but he seems to have become a spent political force.    The Philippines &quot;may look ungovernable&quot; once rivalries in the new Congress begin to slow the tide of legislation, a Western diplomat says. But the election probably has armored the government against the threat of force by soldiers or die-hard loyalists of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Now the government probably could even survive the death of Mrs. Aquino, the most frightening nightmare to trouble Filipinos during her 15 months of one-woman rule.    Mrs. Aquino's &quot;revolutionary&quot; government was based solely on her popularity and her claim to have beaten Mr. Marcos in a disputed 1986 election. Now power has been extended among leading political families and scores of local political machines.    The Senate will even include a sister of the armed forces chief of staff. Many more Filipinos will get a stake in the government's survival when elections are held in August for mayors and other local officials.    Filipinos also voted last week to fill 200 seats in the new House of Representatives. Mrs. Aquino may appoint as many as 50 additional members.    The lower house was the traditional home of patronage and pork-barrel politics in the congresses that preceded Mr. Marcos's dictatorship. Nobody knows how the new House will conduct itself because the campaign involved almost 2,000 candidates fighting over obscure local issues.    &quot;There are too many unknown quantities&quot; to make predictions about the House, says Rene Saguisag, one of Mrs. Aquino's senatorial candidates. </TEXT></DOC>
