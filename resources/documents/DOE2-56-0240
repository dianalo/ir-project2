Under the conditionsemployed the achievable loading was found to be only a function of pressure,irrelevant of the type of trapped noble gas. As observed by X-ray andinfra-red spectroscopy the encapsulates do not recrystallize at hightemperatures. Only after the trapped gas has been completely releasedwill the amorphous matrix become crystalline. The gas release from theencapsulates can be described by a diffusion model. Experimentally itwas shown that the rate-determining step describing the thermal gas evolutionout of the pellets is the diffusion through vitrified particles witha size of a few {mu}m and not the mass transport through the macropores.A high zeolite pellet bulk density in the autoclave can be achieved bymixing fractions of appropriate pellet size distribution. The encapsulatesdo not liberate the sequestered gas when exposed to water, irrespectiveof the conditions employed for the fixation of the noble gas.</TEXT></DOC>
