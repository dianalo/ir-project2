The concession could set a precedent in the Canadian airline industry.    The 8,500 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers began returning to work immediately after the tentative pact was reached. A few flights resumed yesterday and full service is expected by the weekend.    The three-year contract, retroactive to June 28, calls for pension payments to increase annually by half the rate of inflation, but the payments can't rise more than 4% a year. The indexing also applies to about 2,000 current pensioners. In addition, the accord includes wage increases totaling 13% over three years for the ground workers, who now earn an average 15.02 Canadian dollars ($11.48) an hour.    During contract talks, Air Canada said the union's pension proposal, which the union said was essentially adopted, would increase payroll costs 4.5% a year, or 12 million dollars ($9.2 million). It may also make it more difficult for the government to sell all or part of the airline, a move it has been considering for months.    &quot;There is no doubt that this will set a standard in the airline industry,&quot; said Ronald Fontaine, chief union negotiator. He said he expects members to ratify the contract in the next two weeks.    Gordon Sinclair, president of the Air Transport Association of Canada, an airline industry group, said the pension benefit &quot;is going to add a new dimension to most negotiations.&quot;    Air Canada flight attendants are involved in contract talks, and they, too, are seeking indexed pensions.    Air Canada handles 48% of the country's air traffic, and the work stoppage caused severe disruptions. After the first walkouts in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal on Nov. 26, the airline ceased all operations, saying that it wasn't possible to run the system smoothly. </TEXT></DOC>
