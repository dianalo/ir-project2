Thestudents rejected him and called for a general strike.   Maung Maung, a U.S.-educated lawyer seen as a figurehead for themilitary, was appointed chairman of the Burma Socialist ProgramParty in an emergency party session, and legislators of thePeople's Assembly elected him president, Rangoon radio reported.   Sein Lwin, a former general blamed for the bloody suppression ofprevious student protests, stepped down as president Aug. 12 afterfive days of anti-government demonstrations in which at least 95people were killed.   He held office for only 17 days after the resignation of Ne Win,who had ruled since a coup in 1962 and brought economic ruin a richnation.   Maung Maung told the party session, in a speech broadcast later,that party leaders must fulfill ``the just and explicit desires ofthe people'' and improve their living conditions.   ``Simply lecturing others is not sufficient,'' he said. ``Weshould also ... improve ourselves. That we should know more,observe more, and do more is obvious from the demonstrations stagedby the innocent people.''   He cautioned against anger and vengeance in seeking out thoseresponsible for riots and declared: ``We should find ways and doeverything we can to avoid similar disastrous and dangerous eventsfrom emerging again in the future.''   Maung Maung said it has been almost a year since Ne Win spoke ofthe need for economic reform. He said some young people had beendeprived of opportunities to study and educational reform was underway.   Students led the mass protests that brought down Sein Lwin.Although the government said 95 were killed and 240 wounded whentroops fired into crowds of protesters, Western diplomats saidhundreds may have died.   ``Students have called for a nationwide strike on Monday,'' oneWestern diplomat in Rangoon said by telephone. ``They're agitatingfor abolition of one-party rule. The more militant leaders aredisappointed.''   He said students passed out leaflets at a peaceful rally infront of Rangoon General Hospital, a gathering place fordemonstrators since security forces allegedly shot doctors andnurses there a week ago. Japan's Kyodo News Service, reporting fromRangoon, said 15,000 people joined the rally.   Kyodo also said about 100,000 people marched in the northerncity of Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, in the secondstraight day of mass pro-democracy demonstrations. Kyodo saidprovincial government workers walked off their jobs to join thedemonstration. Mandalay's 1984 population was only 600,000.   Under Ne Win, Burma was transformed from a democracy and one ofSoutheast Asia's wealthiest countries to one of its poorest,rivaled only by communist-ruled Laos and Cambodia. Rampantinflation, food shortages and other economic hardships have fedpopular resentment and support for the student demands.   The choice of Maung Maung surprised analysts who predicted thenew leader would come from among active and retired top militaryofficers who helped Ne Win take ``the Burmese way to socialism'' _a mixture of rigid socialist economics, military control andisolation.   Maung Maung, 63, and Education Minister Kyaw Sein are the onlycivilians in the top ranks of the military-dominated governmenthierarchy.   He has a law degree from Yale University, where he spent twoyears as a visiting lecturer in the early 1960s.   After the 1962 coup, he served as chief justice and in 1972 wasnamed justice minister. He was elected to the party CentralCommittee in 1976, and ranked fifth in the party hierarchy. Hewithdrew from the committee in 1985 for health reasons.   Maung Maung returned to the committee after Ne Win resigned July23, and he was named attorney general.   Minoru Kiryu, a Burma scholar in Tokyo, said the election ofMaung Maung ``was the best possible choice for the party in itsconciliatory move to soothe the people who are demanding quickchanges and reforms.''   An Asian diplomat in Rangoon said Maung Maunghe was ``generallywelcomed by intellectuals, while the general public, includingworkers, were showing a wait-and-see attitude.''   Brang Seng, leader of the Kachin guerrilla army and vicepresident of the National Democratic Front of 10 rebel groups, toldKyodo that the front ``will join the students and citizens fightingin the movement for democracy to establish a provisional governmentfor national reconciliation.''   ``As long as the one-party dictatorship continues we willcontinue our struggle against whoever is chosen as the (next)leader,'' he was quoted as saying.   Just before Sein Lwin resigned, Brang Seng called for anoffensive by the rebel front, which claims to have 35,000 fightersin its 40-year-old war for greater autonomy for ethnic minorities.   Radio Rangoon said 52 people arrested in the rioting in Rangoonwere freed Thursday. That brought the number of people reportedfreed in the capital to 155, but thousands more are believed to bebehind bars.   Still held are several people arrested July 29-30, including thecountry's leading dissident, Aung Gyi, and Sein Win, the Burmacorrespondent of The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
