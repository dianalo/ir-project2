All of a sudden the 1988 presidential field is swarming with possible contenders who have one thing in common -- four-letter last names.    This is an odd situation. We have had only three four-letter chief executives: James Polk, William Taft and Gerald Ford -- who was appointed, not elected, to both the vice presidency and presidency. Three out of 40 is not what you would call an overwhelming percentage. The odds may be stacked against the current crop of four-letter Oval Office aspirants.    Who are they? The Republicans boast at least four principal possibilities: Vice President George Bush, Rep. Jack Kemp, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole. Some people suggest that Sen. Dole's wife, Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, should consider running. And Horace Busby, former aide to President Lyndon Johnson, includes New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean on his so-called &quot;twitch list&quot; of potential candidates.    The Democrats have no shortage in this department, either. Until recently, there were three four-letter Democrats widely touted for the presidency: former Sen. Gary Hart, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, and former Virginia Gov. Chuck Robb. The list is growing. A recent Newsweek article says Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore is a potential candidate. And Mr. Busby's &quot;twitch list&quot; includes a prominent Democratic spokesman on foreign policy, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut.    It was way back in 1845 that James Polk, the only Democrat with a four-letter name to occupy the White House, became president. Messrs. Hart, Robb, Nunn, Gore and Dodd may want to take this into account as they consider their presidential prospects. Mr. Hart, in particular, may have some new grounds for debating the wisdom of his decision to shorten his last name from Hartpence.    Rare as four-letter presidents have been, four-lettered vice presidents have come almost as few and far between -- only four. One, Aaron Burr, is infamous, having killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. Another, William King, vice president in 1853 during the Pierce administration, died the same year he was inaugurated. The other two, Gerald Ford and George Bush, happen to be among the three most recent Republican vice presidents, Nelson Rockefeller being the multisyllabic exception. This recent trend, if that is what it is, may give hope to Republican vice presidential aspirants with four-letter surnames.    (Just for the record, 21 presidents have had two-syllable last names, while 11 presidential names have contained three syllables. Three presidents have had one-syllable last names not of four letters, and just one president -- Dwight Eisenhower -- has had four syllables in his last name.)    What can account for such a dismal showing of individuals with four-letter names? My own theory posits that Americans, already measurably cynical about politicians, simply want to avoid associating their national leaders with four-letter words. Lest the four-letter candidates get too discouraged -- and the other candidates become carried away with their good fortune -- bear this in mind: The first real test of presidential timber in 1988 comes in Iowa, a four-letter state.    Mr. Cossolotto, an aide in the House, has no current intentions of running for president or shortening his name. </TEXT></DOC>
