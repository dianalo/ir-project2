Overthe years, many conceptual models have been developed to describe theprogress of a gas-solid reaction starting outside the solid particleas well as that occurring throughout the particle. But the behaviourof a reaction, initiated inside the pellet, is less known. In this paper,a brief outline is given of this relatively rare but important mode ofgas-solid reaction. The causes of this relatively less known behaviourand characteristic features of five typical systems displaying it arediscussed.</TEXT></DOC>
