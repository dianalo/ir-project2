Areddy (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BNK FIN </IN><TEXT>   The national average of certificate-of-deposit yields slipped on most maturities in the week ended yesterday, though there was considerable regional variation.    Bankers have two different factors to consider when setting CD yields, said Norberto Mehl, publisher of New York-based Banxquote Online, an information service. Both competitive pressures and other interest rates -- like those of U.S. Treasury bills, which have slipped in the past two weeks -- influence the bankers' decisions, he said.    Banks in New York are bowing to competitive pressures and haven't adjusted yields on the savings instruments, while banks in other parts of the nation are more tuned to prevailing interest rates and have decreased them.    Though Mr. Mehl said it was unclear where yields are going, he added that the big New York banks usually determine market trends. &quot;Nobody cares if the prime rate goes up in Chicago,&quot; he said.    On average, banks posted yields of 8.58% on one-year certificates in New York, unchanged from last week. Florida banks, on average, increased one-year yields to 8.08%, from 8% last week, Banxquote reported. Illinois institutions lowered yields on one-year maturities to 7.50%, from 7.55% last week.    Banxquote said the average yield for 30-day retail certificates of deposit was unchanged at 6.41%. Retail, or individual savings, CDs are generally regarded as those with denominations of under $50,000. At $50,000 and above, the instruments are called jumbo CDs.    Average yields for longer-term CDs were lower in the week ended Wednesday. The average six-month CD was down to 7.50%, from 7.52% the week before. The average one-year CD yield, meantime, fell one basis point, or 1/100th of a point, to 7.93%. Longer-term, the 2 1/2-year CD dropped to 8.09% from 8.12%, and the average yield on five-year CDs fell two basis points, to 8.44%.    The average yield for money-market accounts rose to 6.14%, from 6.09% last week, according to Banxquote.    These bank accounts compete with money-market mutual funds, whose average compounded yield, over a seven-day period, rose to 7.66% in the week ended Tuesday from 7.65% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter. The average yield, over 30 days, rose to 7.58% from 7.49%, and the average maturity of funds rose to 34 days from 33 days. </TEXT></DOC>
