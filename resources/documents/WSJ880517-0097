The program, much of which already has been announced, aims to reduce the budget deficit to about 4% of economic output this year from earlier predictions of at least 7%. Economic growth is targeted at 4% a year.    Few specifics were included in yesterday's announcement. Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega said the government later this week will detail plans to cut spending by an amount equivalent to about 1% of economic output. Mr. Nobrega had said after an April meeting with IMF officials in Washington that such measures would be announced soon.    The finance minister also said yesterday that details of the spending cuts will be followed by announcements of a new policy to increase industrial productivity, a less-complex tariff policy that may increase market access for some foreign goods, and more-flexible regulations for both importers and exporters.    Other parts of the program, already announced over the past two months, include a freeze on federal lending to state and municipal governments, a suspension of inflation-linked wage adjustments for federal employees and the elimination of a controversial wheat subsidy whose withdrawal had long been demanded by the IMF. The government also has set up a committee to plan the privatization of some state-owned companies and has moved against incometax evaders.    Yesterday's announcement came after a day-long meeting of President Jose Sarney, government ministers and state governors that reflected the difficulties in reforming the country's economy. The state governors gave qualified support to the program, saying that federal spending on housing, health and education must be increased. The program also is being tested in the nation's courts. Some judges, whose own salaries have been frozen under the suspension of inflation-linked adjustments, have ruled in favor of civil servants demanding pay increases.    Since Mr. Nobrega took office in January, he has struggled to bring order to Brazil's economy and to repair relations with the country's foreign creditors. Brazil and its major bank creditors are expected to announce shortly preliminary agreement on a package that would reschedule about $62 billion of the country's medium-term and long-term bank debt at a lower interest rate and provide $5.2 billion in new bank loans to Brazil. An agreement between Brazil and the IMF is expected this summer. </TEXT></DOC>
