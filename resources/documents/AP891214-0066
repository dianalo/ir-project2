Bennett, buthe still strongly opposes efforts to legalize it or any other drug.   ``The last thing I would want to do is recommend the wider useof a drug that makes young people stupid,'' Bennett said in aninterview Wednesday as he launched yet another counter-offensiveagainst the increasingly visible and voluble drug legalizationmovement.   While he said he does not think marijuana is more harmful thanalcohol, Bennett said, ``We have enough of a problem with liquor,thank you.''   Bennett, who has consistently denounced the legalization of anydrugs, spoke on the issue Monday at Harvard University where hedecried ``intellectuals'' who are ``on the editorial and op-edpages ... telling us with an ignorant sneer that our drug policywon't work.''   The next day, a federal judge for the first time joined theranks of drug legalization advocates.   U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet _ a Republican and formerprosecutor appointed by President Carter as a trial judge in theSouthern District of New York _ said in a speech that drugs,including cocaine and heroin, should be legalized, taxed anddispensed by the state because the war on drugs is being lost.   ``I suggest it is time to abolish the prohibition _ to ceasetreating indulgence in mind-alteration as a crime,'' Sweet told theCosmopolitan Club in New York. The result, he said, ``would be theelimination of the profit motive, the gangs, the drug dealers.Obviously, the model is the repeal of Prohibition and the end of AlCapone and Dutch Shultz.''   Interviewed this morning on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, Sweet said,``I have been surprised'' by the furor raised by his suggestion.``This is a huge industry, $150 billion. It ought to be taxed,regulated.''   Terrence Burke, acting deputy director of the Drug EnforcementAdministration, said on the same program that he was ``outraged''by Sweet's proposal.   ``The judge should get off that bench and get down to thestreet, get out of the ... club and get down to Bellevue Hospitaland see some of those crack babies ... I really believe it's aninsult to people who are working in law enforcement in thestreets,'' Burke said.   ``I know all about Bellevue, and I'm not about to go off thebench,'' Sweet responded. ``... This is a very complicated problemand it doesn't lend itself to ... comments about insults ... Icertainly believe in the agents who are doing their job as I hope Iam doing mine.''   Bennett led a chorus of political and law enforcement officialsWednesday rebutting Sweet's speech and the drug legalizationargument.   The argument, Bennett said, ``is as stupid and morally atrociousas it ever was. It doesn't make any sense...   ``Judges aren't any more immune to ignorance than people inother professions,'' he said. Being a judge ``doesn't mean you'rewise, it means somebody's made you a judge.''   ``If he doesn't like his work, if he's tired of sentencingpeople, he should find another line of work,'' Bennett said. ``It'sbetter to have clogged courts ... than crowded, jammed pediatricwards of cocaine babies, which we will have a lot more of if wetake his proposal seriously.''   In New York, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Sweet's speech``shows a shocking lack of reality. ... This almost comes fromfairyland.   ``If his policy were accepted he would be consigning millions ofmore to lives of addictions,'' D'Amato said during a pressconference. ``He would be responsible for the deaths of millions ofmore. ... It is a policy that is irresponsible.''   Robert Stutman, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration'sNew York office, said nearly three-quarters of the children who arebeaten to death in New York had drug-abusing parents.   ``If you advocate a policy that says more parents are going touse drugs you are therefore advocating a policy that says more kidsare going to be beaten to death,'' Stutman said. ``I think thatstinks.''   Sterling Johnson Jr., the special New York state prosecutor fornarcotics, added, ``This is not the time to be advocatinglegalization of drugs when we are trying to tell every young manand child drugs are wrong for you.''   The drug legalization movement recently was boosted by theaddition of President Reagan's Secretary of State George P. Shultz.He argued during a speech at Stanford University that, ``It seemsto me we're not really going to get anywhere until we can take thecriminality out of the drug business and the incentives forcriminality out of it. ... We need at least to consider and examineforms of controlled legalization of drugs.''   The movement already included a broad cross-section of thepolitical spectrum. On the conservative side are economist MiltonFriedman and political commentator William F. Buckley. On theliberal side are such people as Democratic Mayor Kurt Schmoke ofBaltimore, a former prosecutor; journalist and Carteradministration State Department spokesman Hodding Carter III, andformer Attorney General Ramsey Clark.</TEXT></DOC>
