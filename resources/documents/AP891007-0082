Miss Davis, a two-time Academy Award winner, died Friday at theAmerican Hospital in Paris after a long fight with cancer. She was81.   ``She was a beacon of light for all of us who were startingout,'' said Angela Lansbury, who said she idolized the movie staras a child in England. She appeared with Miss Davis in the 1982television miniseries ``Little Gloria _ Happy at Last.''   ``She once said to me, `The thing about us, we're characteractresses.' She wasn't a great beauty, and she knew that,'' MissLansbury said from her home in Los Angeles. ``She was a tremendousrole model for me. She simply encouraged my aspirations as also not(being) a great beauty.''   ``I admired her dogged attention to keep going. ... She never,never gave up, to the very end.''   A perfectionist, Miss Davis loathed sloppy work, Miss Lansburysaid.   ``Her great problem was, that she didn't feel that people wereprofessional enough. Young actors wouldn't get to the set on time.She was professional. ... She didn't throw fits, she didn't keeppeople waiting. ... She gained attention through her work.''   Vincent Price, who worked with Miss Davis on ``The Private Livesof Elizabeth and Essex'' in 1939 and ``Whales of August'' in 1987,mourned her as a film genius.   ``There are very few people left who really sum up the motionpicture industry, who had that star quality. It was really rare,''Price said in Los Angeles. ``She had extraordinary energy; she wasa genius.''   ``I'm sorry that her ilk doesn't come along anymore,'' saidErnest Borgnine, who worked with Miss Davis on two films, including``The Catered Affair'' in 1956. ``She wanted perfection, but shewas never hard.''   ``Bette Davis was surely one of the most significant women toshape American film, both through her talents as an actress and herspirited character,'' Charlton Heston said from his home in LosAngeles.   ``She seemed to me to be an ideal motion picture actress,'' saidJames Stewart, who costarred with Miss Davis in the 1983 cable-TVfilm ``Right of Way.''   ``She had this wonderful, wonderful talent and was verycooperative to other people in the picture and with the crew.   ``I never experienced any better than that spirit of cooperationand (of) being able to work for the scene, and not just for self inthe scene.''   ``What a loss,'' said Olivia de Havilland, who worked with MissDavis in four films, including the 1964 ``Hush, Hush SweetCharlotte.''   ``She was a remarkable person to work with, highly professional,innovative, brilliant and quick,'' said Miss de Havilland, 73, wholives in Paris. ``She was very well-disciplined. I thought she hadsome marvelous personal qualities and I was very fond of her.''   In a statement, former President Reagan, himself a formerHollywood actor who appeared with Miss Davis in the 1939 film``Dark Victory,'' called her ``one of the true greats in the motionpicture business. She gave us some of the most memorable moments inthe history of film and touched us in a way few others have.''   ``For Bette, acting was more than a profession; it was an art.''   Glenn Ford credited Miss Davis with restarting his acting careerafter World War II:   ``When I got back after the war, she gave me a role opposite herin a (1946) film called `A Stolen Life,' and from there I went on.Because of Bette, I was able to begin again after I'd been away fora while.''</TEXT></DOC>
