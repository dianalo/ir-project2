In a carefully worded letter to its 350 members early thisweek the National Council of Savings Institutions said thatthe U.S. League of Savings Institutions &quot;has asked us todiscuss common interests.&quot; Most of the National Council'smembers are savings banks, which are generally statechartered with broader powers than savings and loanassociations.</LP><TEXT>   The U.S. League has 2,148 members, most of which aresavings and loan associations. The U.S. League during the1980s lobbied on behalf of legislation that has been cited ascontributing to the thrift crisis.   Confirming the proposal for talks, which could beginwithin the next two weeks, Don Shackelford, chairman of theU.S. League, said &quot;The philosophical differences between thetwo groups is much lower than it's ever been.&quot;   The two groups have historically been apart on the needfor separate thrift powers, with the U.S. League in favor ofkeeping thrifts distinctly different from banks and otherfinancial institutions.   The U.S. League &quot;is not the adamant supporter it once wasfor keeping a separately regulated industry,&quot; said Bert Elyof Ely andamp; Co., a thrift consulting firm in Alexandria, Va. Headded, &quot;There are many thrifts who feel the time has come tobe treated like a bank while retaining their specialty inhome mortgages.&quot;   Mr. Shackelford, who is chairman of State Savings Bank inColumbus, Ohio, added that the U.S. League is in the processof consolidating its Chicago headquarters staff into itsWashington office and &quot;the window of opportunity exists nowto sit down and talk with the National Council,&quot; which isalso located in Washington to eliminate redundancies in staffpositions.   The need to cut costs at the trade associations is evidentas their membership declines because of thrift failures andmergers. At the end of 1989, the National Council had nearly130 more members than now and the U.S. League had about 600more members.</TEXT></DOC>
