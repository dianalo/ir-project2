Last October, Chinese officials unveiled regulations promising foreign-invested enterprises more tax breaks, lower labor costs and easier access to scarce foreign exchange, among other concessions. But figures released last week by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade showed that contracted foreign investment in the first half fell 12% from the year before, to $1.09 billion. Compared with year-earlier figures, contracted investment has been declining since the end of 1985.    Foreign executives and diplomats said the decline means China hasn't done enough to alter a perception among foreigners that too many investment problems remain, including demands from corrupt and greedy officials, difficulties in getting foreign exchange and problems with raw-material supplies.    &quot;They are going in a direction opposite to the one in which they want to go,&quot; a Western diplomat said. &quot;If they want to attract foreign investment, they are going to have to do something different.&quot;    Most new ventures involve small amounts of equity. The foreign trade ministry's figures showed that while the number of approved equity joint ventures increased during the first half to 461 from 304, the total value fell.    The investments that actually arrived in China during the first six months totaled $728 million, up 1%. Contracted investment reflects signed commitments, while the $728 million figure represents actual injections of funds. </TEXT></DOC>
