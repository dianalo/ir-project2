Travelers from the Loganville section of Monrovia reported largenumbers of government casualties lying around the railway terminal.One witness reported a truck loaded with government wounded rushingtoward the city's only working hospital.   The fighting was near the Bong iron ore mines' railway and theterminal itself, witnesses said. The railroad station, three milesfrom downtown Monrovia, was the closest the rebels have yet come tothe city center after a 10-day lull in the 7-month-old civil war.   In Washington, meanwhile, the foreign minister of Liberia andother prominent Liberians appealed Thursday to the United Statesfor a temporary U.S. peacekeeping force to help prevent furtherbloodshed.   Foreign Minister J. Rudolph Johnson, Washington AmbassadorEugenia Wordsworth-Stevenson and eight other Liberians wrotePresident Bush that they expect the ``resignation and departurefrom Liberia'' of President Samuel Doe ``and the establishment ofan interim government.''   The letter proposed ``a limited U.S. force be provided, on theinvitation of that interim government, to play an initialpeacekeeping role'' in the vicinity of Monrovia.   The appeal did not explain how the resignation and departure ofDoe would be carried out.   Earlier Thursday, rebels ambushed government troops trying totake a key intersection on the road to the country's internationalairport, forcing them to retreat, military sources said.   Sixty government troops were sent to recapture Red LightJunction, six miles from downtown, the military sources said.Forces of the rebel National Patriotic Front of Liberia ambushedthe troops, killing three.   The junction is on the main road to the international airport atRobertsfield, held by the rebels for several weeks. Journalists whotried to visit the area were turned back by government troops onemile from the fighting.   The rebels have brought heavy artillery to the north ofMonrovia, Liberian security sources said. Armored cars andartillery have been seen moving south from Kakata toward Monroviain the past two days, the sources said.   Rebel control of parts of Lofa County, north of Monrovia, hasled government troops to turn back refugees fleeing the capital,witnesses said.   In the capital, food shortages and the fear of a rebel attackincreased. Up to 1,300 Lebanese living in Liberia, primarily smallbusinessmen and their families, have registered with the LebaneseEmbassy to leave aboard a ship en route from Tunisia.   ``We don't feel any direct threat but there's a great deal oflooting taking place, not only businesses but houses as well,''Lebanese Ambassador Michel Bitard said.   The ship has been chartered by the Arab League.   In neighboring Sierra Leone, a rebel leader, Thomas Woewiyu,said late Thursday that no progress was made in talks betweenintermediaries of the two sides. He said the rebels would notcompromise on their demand that Doe resign before a formalcease-fire can be reached.   The rebels, led by former Doe aide Charles Taylor, advanced tothe fringes of Monrovia before their advance was halted. Tayloraccuses Doe's government of corruption, inefficiency and humanrights abuses.   Doe has agreed not to seek re-election but has so far refused toleave the country. He has a force of 500 Israeli-trained troopsdefending his heavily fortified residence in Monrovia.   Random killings have been reported on both sides as theinsurgency has degenerated into tribal warfare. Most rebels comefrom the Gio and Mano tribes, while government supporters aremostly Krahns and Mandingos. Doe is a Krahn.   Hundreds of people are streaming out of the city in thedirection of Sierra Leone. Taylor's forces have opened the highwayfrom the surrounded capital to the Sierra Leone border to allowrefugees to flee, military sources reported.   Most of Monrovia has been without power for two weeks, and watersupplies have been cut. Residents have been forced to collect rainwater and forage for food as supplies dwindle and soldiers lootwhat is left.   Doe took power in a violent 1980 coup that ousted theincumbents, descendants of American immigrants who historicallymonopolized power and discriminated against indigenous Liberians.Liberia was founded in the 19th century by freed slaves from theUnited States.</TEXT></DOC>
