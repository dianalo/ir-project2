McBirney III, former owner of thedefunct Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas.   Mr. McBirney will cooperate with federal prosecutors aspart of an agreement under which he will plead guilty to bankfraud and three other federal criminal charges. The pleaagreement was filed Friday in federal court in Dallas.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. McBirney is valuable to the prosecutors because of hisextensive dealings with other thrifts and their executivesduring the four years that he was chairman and chiefexecutive officer of Sunbelt Savings. Sunbelt made 145 loanstotaling $523.3 million to the directors, officers andshareholders of other thrifts, according to thriftregulators, who tallied Sunbelt's total losses at more than$2 billion.   Among the now-failed thrifts that were involved in realestate and loan transactions with Sunbelt and Mr. McBirneywere San Jacinto Savings Association of Houston, a unit ofSouthmark Corp. until its seizure last month by thriftregulators; Independent American Savings Association, whichwas owned by Thomas R. Gaubert of Dallas; and Western SavingsAssociation of Dallas, formerly owned by Jarrett E. Woods Jr.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation has acknowledged anongoing criminal investigation of San Jacinto, and Mr.Gaubert has remained a target of federal prosecutors despitehis acquittal in October 1988 on charges related to loansfrom a now-defunct Iowa thrift. Mr. Woods is scheduled fortrial in January on 37 charges related to the failure ofWestern Savings, which had extensive dealings with Sunbelt inloans and real estate transactions.   A loan agreement between Western and Sunbelt is at theheart of the bank-fraud charge to which Mr. McBirney hasagreed to plead guilty. Mr. McBirney also agreed to pleadguilty to charges that he filed a false tax return on behalfof one of his companies, Amchase Financial Corp.; that hecaused a false statement to be made to Sunbelt; and that hemisapplied $250,000 in thrift funds in connection with anunspecified loan.   The four charges carry a maximum possible sentence of 15years in federal prison, well below the 85-year sentence thatMr. McBirney could have faced if he had been convicted of all17 charges contained in his indictment last July.   Federal prosecutors agreed to delay Mr. McBirney'ssentencing for up to two years, according to his attorney,Paul E. Coggins of Dallas. The delay will give Mr. McBirney agreater impetus to cooperate and underscores the importancethe Justice Department is placing on his help.   Mr. Coggins said negotiations of a plea agreement hadbegun before Mr. McBirney's indictment but an actual dealwasn't struck and signed until Nov. 16.   The filing of the agreement was delayed until Friday toavoid influencing the Dallas federal jury that was hearingtestimony in the trial of another former Texas thrift owner,Don R. Dixon.   The jury convicted Mr. Dixon Thursday on 23 chargesrelated to the misuse of funds from the defunct VernonSavings andamp; Loan Association, which he owned. Mr. Dixon faces amaximum possible prison term of 120 years at his sentencing,scheduled for February.   In Washington, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said,&quot;Bringing to justice top Sandamp;L executives such as McBirney andDixon belies the myth that those at the top can avoidprosecution for their criminal acts.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
