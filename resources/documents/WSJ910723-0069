In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7620marks, up from 1.7475 marks late Friday. The U.S. currencyalso was changing hands at 137.65 yen, up from 136.40 yen.Sterling was trading at $1.6795, down from $1.6945.</LP><TEXT>   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quotedat 137.45 yen, up from Tokyo's Monday close of 136.65 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.7628 marks, upfrom 1.7528 marks at Monday's close.   The dollar still lacks direction, and traders said testsof the extremes of its trading range are helping dealerstease out market sentiment.   People are wondering whether the dollar's decline sinceJuly 12 &quot;is a true trend reversal, or whether this is just amajor correction on a rally toward 2.000&quot; marks, said Carl F.Amendola, assistant vice president at BayerischeHypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank in New York.   The dollar hit its intraday low early in the globaltrading day, in what traders said was a continuation ofFriday's decline, then firmed as traders began to buydollars. After Friday's sharp decline against the mark, theU.S. unit was considered oversold, traders said.   European dealers bought the dollar and were joined by U.S.players at the start of the North American trading day. Butthe dollar began to fall again around the end of the Europeanday as participants aggressively liquidated their long, oroverbought, positions. The selling also drew some aggressiveU.S. players into the market, said Alfonso Alejo, vicepresident and corporate foreign exchange manager at MitsuiTaiyo Kobe Bank in New York.   But late in the North American morning as the dollarreached 1.7520 marks, buyers stepped in and triggered a risethat squeezed out those with short, or oversold, positions.The buying sent the dollar to its intraday high of 1.7644marks.   Market participants will try to take the dollar higherthis week for a &quot;hard test&quot; of 1.7850 marks &quot;to see if thedowntrend is for real,&quot; said Mr. Alejo. If the dollar comesoff sharply from that level, then players expect it to movelower and want to take profits, he said.   But if the dollar lingers around 1.7850 marks for severaldays and moves higher, then participants expect its uptrendto resume and will want to hold onto dollars.   Although traders are trying to determine the market'ssentiment, they aren't eager about taking positions. Theylikely will wait for this week's U.S. economic news beforeentering the market in any big way, said John Krey,international economist at MCM CurrencyWatch, New York.   Data on U.S. durable goods orders in June andsecond-quarter gross national product, due tomorrow andFriday, respectively, might give the dollar direction.   But in recent weeks, most U.S. indicators have fallenwithin expectations, adding little fresh incentive to themarket, Mr. Amendola said.   Economists predict that the pace of growth in durablegoods orders has slackened considerably since May. U.S.durable goods orders are expected to have risen by 0.5% inJune, compared with May's 3.4% increase, according to anaverage of estimates of 12 economists surveyed.   Traders aren't afraid of U.S. central bank interventionfor the near term, because the U.S. unit is well below the1.8300 mark-level at which central banks of Group of Sevencountries began concerted intervention July 12.   The U.S. dollar yesterday rose against the Australiandollar, which was hit by the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkand the Bank of England. The central banks sold theAustralian currency for U.S. dollars on behalf of the ReserveBank of Australia, which is trying to keep the currency below78 U.S. cents, traders said.   The Fed sales of Australian dollars occurred aroundmidmorning New York time as the Australian currency traded at77.85 U.S. cents, according to traders. The Australian dollarwas quoted late in New York trading at 77.6 U.S. cents, downfrom 77.8 cents Friday.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $367.60 an ounce, down $3. Estimatedvolume was a moderate three million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $367.45 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
