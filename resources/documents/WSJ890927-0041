The Providence, R.I., bank holding company said that because of tax considerations, it isn't possible at this time to be specific about the amount of the projected loss. In the year-earlier quarter, Old Stone earned $9.2 million, or $1.02 a share.    The company said it expects to be profitable for the fourth quarter and the full year, assuming completion of a pending transaction. Old Stone said discussions are currently under way that could lead to the sale of certain subsidiaries, which would produce substantial gains. The company said its Old Stone Bank unit isn't being considered for divestiture.    The company said the moves aren't expected to affect dividend payments. </TEXT></DOC>
