TWA said it had sold an interest in 5 million shares of USXCorp. to its parent, TWA Airlines, which in turn gave the carrierthe money.   ``The proceeds of the sale would be added to TWA's generalworking capital and would be used for general corporate purposes,''the airline said in a statement that referred questions tospokesman Gary Duberstein.   Duberstein declined to discuss the matter with a reporter onThursday.   The stock transfer comes at a time when other airlines havesought cash infusions through the sales of various assets, and, inthe case of Eastern Airlines, persuading a bankruptcy court torelease millions of dollars from an escrow account.   The corporate statement said Trans World picked up a $30 millionprofit from the transfer, with the shares priced at Wednesday'sclose of $30.75, and it still retains an interest in about 6.8million shares of USX.   Analysts said the airline was apparently putting its hands onneeded cash after being hit hard by the rise in fuel costs broughton by the Persian Gulf crisis. Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait, TWAhas been hurt through recent years as competitors with strongerdomestic hubs have built up their service to foreign destinations,chipping away at TWA's strong suit.   That trend has also hurt Pan Am Corp., which along with TransWorld used to dominate overseas travel. Years ago, many passengersflew however they could to New York, where they connected to TransWorld or Pan Am flights into Europe, but now many people fly thecompetition directly from other cities to foreign points.   ``The other carriers have moved those passengers from TransWorld and Pan Am to their own airlines flying out of interiorpoints,'' said George James, president of Airline Economics Inc., aWashington-based aviation consulting firm.   ``They have some serious cash flow problems as most of thecarriers who are in financial trouble have,'' James said.   Airline analyst Raymond E. Neidl of Dillon Read andamp; Co. Inc.agreed Trans World has probably started running low on cash justbefore winter, traditionally the worst time of the year forairlines.   ``They're taking money out of one pocket and putting intoanother,'' Neidl said. ``I think it's a wise move.''   James estimated that higher fuel prices during the last fivemonths of the year will probably cost Trans World from $200 millionto $250 million. The increased costs come as demand for air travelhas tapered off.</TEXT></DOC>
