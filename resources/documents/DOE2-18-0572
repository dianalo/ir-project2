To demonstratethe method Kodak NMB-1 film was exposed using a 16-step-wedge phantomusing Tc-99m and a Siemens ZLC camera. Individual curve segments obtainedat different CRT intensities were smoothed using a linearized form ofthe logistic distribution, and then the curve segments were ties togetherat the point of overlap. The logistic equation also allows one to writedown by inspection expressions for average and point gammas.</TEXT></DOC>
