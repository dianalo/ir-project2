Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in theirfirst public examination of the issue in detail, rebuked thetwo allies for providing what they contend is tokenassistance. Testifying before the panel, Defense SecretaryDick Cheney acknowleged that promised contributions &quot;may wellbe inadequate,&quot; and he indicated the administration isdetermined to increase pressure for substantially greaterassistance from European and other nations.</LP><TEXT>   The tone of the comments by senators, coming on the heelsof administration announcements of significant alliedfinancial support, underscores increasing congressionalconcern over the escalating cost and duration of thedeployment of U.S. troops, ships and planes in the Mideast.Some Army planners, for instance, are operating under theassumption that a major contingent of U.S. ground forces mayhave to remain in Saudi Arabia for as long as two years, withfresh troops coming into the nation every six months.   While Secretary Cheney didn't give a specific timetable,both his comments and the testimony of Gen. Colin Powell,chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggest U.S.commanders are convinced Iraq won't withdraw from Kuwaitsoon. Responding to a question about whether Iraq mightattack as its economy deteriorates, Secretary Cheney said,&quot;We'll be able to answer that question a lot better a yearfrom now. . . . I don't know ultimately how it's going to beresolved.&quot;   Gen. Powell told the panel that the Pentagon will continueto build up forces in the Middle East but that &quot;we haven'tcome down firmly on six months&quot; as the time to replacetroops.   U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia include more than 75,000troops and nearly 1,000 helicopters, according to Pentagonofficials, with some 100 U.S. cargo vessels and Navy shipsparticipating in the operation. For the next few weeks ormonths, Mr. Cheney said, U.S. forces will focus on thwartingany attack by Iraq. &quot;Certainly I have not been given anyinstructions to carry out offensive action,&quot; he said. TheU.S. role &quot;may well involve a longer term commitment than weexpected&quot; before the deployment was well under way, he said.   In his most specific projection so far, Secretary Cheneysaid he expects contributions from Arab nations and otherallies to cover about half of the roughly $15 billion annualcost of maintaining U.S. troops, planes and ships in SaudiArabia and nearby waters. &quot;The response to date has been morethan we have ever gotten before&quot; from allies, Mr. Cheneysaid, &quot;but it may well be inadequate.&quot;   Last week, other administration officials indicated thatcontributions from Arab states would be enough to cover mostof the extra costs.   Members of the committee were eager to criticize the levelof foreign assistance, even as many of them maneuvered togarner credit for providing free mailing privileges, imminentdanger pay, income-tax waivers and other benefits to thetroops in Saudi Arabia. Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), the mainsponsor of one such bill, said it would add an estimated $700million to the overall annual cost of the operation.   Noting that West Germany has agreed to provide as much as$8 billion to subsidize Soviet troops remaining in EastGermany, Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine) accused Bonn ofoffering &quot;little more than pocket-change&quot; to help refugeesand resolve the crisis in the Middle East. Sen. John McCain(R., Ariz.) called promises of West German contributions&quot;almost an insult,&quot; which he warned could &quot;dramatically erodethe very strong relationship&quot; between Washington and Bonn.   The Japanese government, which previously pledged $1billion to help the effort against Iraq and is nowconsidering giving another $2 billion to Egypt, Turkey andJordan -- the nations hit hardest by the economic sanctionsagainst Iraq -- also was attacked. Referring to Tokyo's claimthat it is legally barred from providing substantialassistance to U.S. forces in the Middle East, Sen. McCainsaid, &quot;They have proved once again that they have the world'smost flexible constitution.&quot;   Mr. Cheney sketched a scenario in which the embargo willsoon begin to hurt the Iraqi economy badly. &quot;We're confidentthat we've been able to close off (Iraq's) ability to exportoil,&quot; he said.   Mr. Cheney said the Pentagon was &quot;taking measures&quot; toenhance protection of U.S. troops and civilians overseas andat home because &quot;terrorism is potentially a significantweapon in the Iraqi arsenal.&quot; He said U.S. officials &quot;havereceived bomb threats, death threats, and verbal warningsfrom international terrorist organizations.&quot;   Meanwhile, the State Department announced that Iraq saidit would permit U.S. males born in Iraq, Kuwait or other Arabnations to leave, along with the women and children Baghdadhas been permitting to depart. State Department SpokesmanRichard Boucher said the announcement was &quot;an importantdevelopment. It's news that we welcome.&quot; But he added, &quot;As wehave seen in the past, there are sometimes wrinkles inserted&quot;by Iraq in such offers.   Mr. Boucher also said the U.S. is arranging for two morecharter flights to evacuate U.S. citizens from Kuwait andIraq, tentatively scheduled to leave Baghdad today andFriday.   He said about 600 Americans have been evacuated fromKuwait and Iraq so far and estimated that about 1,700 U.S.citizens remained in Kuwait and about 100 in Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
