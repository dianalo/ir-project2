On Wednesday, however, there was enough thalj to build athaljman or hurl a thaljball.   A storm moving through the area over the past three days droppedup to three feet of snow in some areas, and forecasters werepredicting more on the way. Usually, the Middle East gets at most alight dusting of snow.   No weather-related casualties were reported, but gusts of up to100 mph downed trees and power lines.   In Jordan, the narrow gorge leading into the ancient city ofPetra, the country's main tourist attraction, had to be closed.Officials feared that melting snow would turn it into a raging floodcourse.   Tourists looking for sun were awed by the famous pink cliffsdusted with white.   ``No one expected such a thing. Snow was not what the touristscame for,'' said visitor Jan Bovirhuis of Assen, Holland. ``We foundit extremely beautiful and nice to be in Petra in the snow.''   About 110 miles to the north, children in the hilly capital ofAmman gleefully pelted pedestrians with snowballs in freezingtemperatures and overcast skies.   People in the area treat any snowfall as a holiday decreed byGod, with families piling into cars to head into the hills for acloser look. In Lebanon, many mountain roads were blocked, leavingseveral villages isolated.   The Lebanese, long used to lack of government services after 13years of civil war, were not perturbed by the abundant snow. Mosthouses in the mountains have a month's supply of food and fuel onhand for the next time militia battles make the roads unpassable.   In Israel, snow that fell Monday covered the picturesque artists'colony of Safed in northern Israel. Mt. Hermon, a ski spot in theannexed Golan Heights, received about three feet of snow, accordingto weather reports.   Major roads between Lebanon, Syria and Jordan were kept open withbulldozers.   In lower areas the violent winds were accompanied by drivingrain, forcing people to stay indoors.   Not every place saw the snow, of course. The Saudi Arabian RedSea town of Jezan was a balmy 90 degrees on Wednesday.   But with another cold front on the way, said Ali Abandah,director of Jordan's national weather service, the northern parts ofthe Middle East may get a new round of snow for the New Year.</TEXT></DOC>
