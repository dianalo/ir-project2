Particularfeatures of this project are: (i) development of high sensitivity instrumentationand low-level electronics to handle some 10/sup 8/ charges; (ii) RF gymnasticsrequired to cover the large frequency range; (iii) operation of the ionprogramme while continuing to provide the other users with protons. Newinstrumentation, such as several types of beam transformer, are described.The extension of the radial position and phase detection systems towardsthese low intensities, enabling the beam to be accelerated in closedloop, is presented. Difficulties arising from the pulse-sharing mode(10/sup 8/ and 10/sup 13/ charges/ring to be accelerated on alternatecycles) are discussed in the light of recent beam tests.</TEXT></DOC>
