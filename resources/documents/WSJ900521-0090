Maybe so. But Windows 3.0, a product he's so proud of thateven his mother will be on hand when Microsoft unveils ittomorrow, presents the most formidable technical challengeever to the Macintosh, Apple Computer's main computer family.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gates says he has always been interested in making PCseasy to use. But he insists that only recently have theygrown powerful enough to handle the images and split-screensneeded to control them with simple, intuitive commands.   Yet Apple did precisely this six years ago, and became thesecond largest supplier of personal computers in the world.Apple created for its Macintosh a new system software, theprogram that controls basic operations such as storing filesand sending documents to a printer. The Macintosh operatingsystem was entirely different from Microsoft's MS-DOS, thestandard for most other desktop computers.   In MS-DOS, programs' effectiveness is restricted by memorylimitations, and users risk confusion if they forget arcanecommand codes. The Macintosh gave the user visual cues tosimplify mundane tasks like copying documents or storingfiles.   Now Microsoft's new Windows, after two earlier,disappointing Windows versions, comes close to matching themost compelling features of the Macintosh. And it does sowithin the familiar MS-DOS standard, so consumers don't haveto jettison their old programs. Windows even promises afeature that Macintoshes won't have until next year: theability to automatically exchange data between two differentprograms.   Computer experts say the Macintosh system still makes itsimpler to start up the machine, store files and hook upprinters, among other things. But those differences may notovershadow the major advantage of PCs that use MS-DOS andWindows: They are far less expensive.   Apple has less-costly models on the way. It will introducea color Macintosh for less than $2,000 as early as this fall.And it doesn't concede that Windows is its equal: &quot;Microsoftis very good at comparing their intentions with ourrealities,&quot; says Jim Davis, Apple's director of systemssoftware marketing.   But Apple takes Windows seriously enough that it has suedMicrosoft charging copyright infringement. Apple also worriesthat it is too dependent on Microsoft for applications -- thethree best-selling packages for the Macintosh are made byMicrosoft -- and that in the future Microsoft may give lessattention to Macintosh applications. Over the years, some atApple have called for breaking with Mr. Gates, fearing thathis secret plan is to weaken Apple's position by imposing asingle software standard for all desktop users.   Yet today Mr. Gates enjoys cordial relations with Applechief executive John Sculley. About two months ago, he evenspent several hours helping Mr. Sculley hash out Apple'stechnical direction.   Mr. Gates says the way for Apple to keep its edge is tocontinue to deliver new ways of controlling the PC-voice,handwriting, multimedia, whatever. But &quot;Apple needs tofocus,&quot; he says. &quot;John agrees. Now let's see if he picks theright areas.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
