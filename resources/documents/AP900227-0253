Dallas-based Greyhound, which operates the nation's onlyintercity bus system, faces a 12:01 a.m. Friday strike deadline setby the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, whichrepresents 6,300 drivers and 3,075 of the company's office andmaintenance workers.   Full scale negotiations over wage issues ceased last week, butlow-level talks resumed in Scottsdale, Ariz., Sunday, and a newsblackout was imposed until noon local time Tuesday. That deadlinewas extended until noon Wednesday, company spokesman Liz Hale said.   Citing the blackout, Ms. Hale refused to say if progress hadbeen made in the talks.   The two sides went into negotiations far apart on wage issues,with the company saying it could not afford more than its initial$63 million offer. The company estimates the union's three-yearproposal would cost $406 million.   Greyhound has said it will operate on a limited schedule if thedrivers go on strike, with plans to be back to full operations bythe end of March.</TEXT></DOC>
