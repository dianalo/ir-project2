SEEKS IDEAS ON PARKING FOR ARENA  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;We'll be there to listen and to document what they say,&quot; Gonzales said. Atleast two more meetings are planned.;    In May, the city's streets andtraffic department released a report outlining the beginnings of a trafficplan. It included several proposals for signal and street capacityimprovements. The $125 million arena site is at the Southern Pacific railcrossing of West Santa Clara Street.;    The city is also planning four permitparking clusters for residents around the arena; computer signal controls onThe Alameda, Market and Santa Clara streets; and on-site parking for 2,100vehicles.;    A key to the program will be whether the city can get moreparking from nearby private agencies, such as the San Jose Water Co. Also, thecity must find a way to keep arena fans from bypassing expensive parking lotsfor free curbs in front of homes.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff Report  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910808  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  228  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday August 8, 199100221207,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
