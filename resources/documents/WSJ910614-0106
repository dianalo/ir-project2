Tektronix Inc., a company based in Beaverton, Ore., thatis best-known for its electronic instruments, plans tointroduce a printer on Monday that uses a new type of ink andpromises high-quality prints on plain paper -- and many othermaterials ranging from cardboard to tissues. The printer,which carries a list price of $9,995 and will be available inJuly, uses a solid, wax-based ink that is safer and easier tohandle than conventional printer inks.</LP><TEXT>   Today, high-quality color printers are mainly used bygraphic artists to prepare packaging and advertisements. Theyare a rarity in business offices, where black-and-whiteprinters are as common as telephones and faxes. Besides beingexpensive, today's sophisticated color printers require messyinks and special paper.   Some analysts think the shift to ordinary paper couldignite demand for color printers, transforming officedocuments in the process.   &quot;Plain paper is really the key for the office market totake off,&quot; says Donna Wheatley, a marketing director atDataproducts Inc., Woodland Hills, Calif., which plans tointroduce a solid-ink printer later this year. InfoCorpestimates unit sales of the printers should double by 1995 tonearly 100,000.   The emergence of a U.S. company at the forefront of colorprinting is something of a surprise. Computer printing is oneof a number of high-tech niches pioneered by U.S. companiesbut best exploited by the Japanese. Hewlett-Packard Co., thebiggest name in computer printing, dominates the estimated $4billion a year market for high-end laser printers, but theguts, or &quot;engines,&quot; of Hewlett-Packard's machines come fromCanon. Canon also supplies the &quot;engines&quot; for Apple'sbig-selling family of laser printers.   Canon wants to gain the same sway over the color printermarket as it holds over the black-and-white market. So far,however, the company offers only a combination plain-paperprinter-copier whose list price starts at $22,500. And theoutput of these laser printers is considered less sharp andvivid than pages produced by Tektronix's printer.   But it isn't clear how long Tektronix can hold onto thelead. On the minus side: Tektronix's printer is slow, takingseveral minutes to produce a single full-color page.   Competitors hope to do better. Canon says it will show anew color printer at the Comdex computer show this fall thatmay be comparably priced. It won't say when it will ship theproduct, which is expected to use a laser engine. Meanwhile,Dataproducts Inc., a Japanese-controlled company, promises todeliver a plain-paper color printer later this year for lessthan $10,000.   The printer from Dataproducts will also use solid ink.Dataproducts holds a patent on aspects of solid ink,purchased from a former unit of Exxon, which first developedthe ink. While Tektronix acknowledges licensing thistechnology, the company says its own technology is home-grownand that it struck a deal with Dataproducts only to pre-empta legal action.   The crucial innovation embedded in its printer, Tektronixsays, involves its own proprietary method of converting solidink into a liquid using heat, shoving it through the printeronto the page and fusing it back into a solid by applying3,000 pounds of pressure to the page.   &quot;This is a significant piece of American technology,&quot; saysEdward Pullen, an InfoCorp analyst. He says the technology is&quot;scalable,&quot; meaning the basic design is simple enough that itshould result in color printers priced below $3,000 by themid-1990s.   Whether Tektronix succeeds in bringing color printing intothe mainstream of office life, however, also depends on itsmarketing savvy, a knack Tektronix didn't display much in the1980s, when its sales stagnated. &quot;Certainly, this technologyhas the potential to become pervasive, but that depends onhow quickly Tektronix can bring the price down and improvethe speed of its printer,&quot; says Angele Boyd, an analyst atInternational Data Corp.   Ms. Boyd notes that for color documents to really catchon, computer software must be adapted to take advantage ofthe capability.   In the end, Tektronix could become another U.S. companythat has pioneered a technology only to have a Japaneseconcern -- Dataproducts, for instance -- capitalize on theinnovation.   There is even a chance that Hewlett-Packard will improveits home-grown inkjet technique so that its low-end colorprinters will be able to satisfy quality demands.Hewlett-Packard and others sell color printers for less than$1,500, but these machines still require special clay-coatedpaper to prevent colors from losing definition and vividness.
