Analysts said they doubted the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries would succeed in driving prices backup to their target of $18 a barrel even in the short run.   The analysts also said consumers should see little effect fromthe agreement.   ``We don't know if OPEC nations are going to adhere to anagreement,'' said William Byers, an analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.in New York. ``If so, prices could go higher, but that's anassumption that's premature to make.''   Steve Hanke, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins Universityin Baltimore, said: ``Cheating could occur right from day one. Andin fact, there's every reason to believe it will.''   OPEC members have been producing far above the cartel's overallceiling set in a 1986 agreement.   Final approval was still up in the air for the latest accord,which hinged on Iran accepting production parity with Iraq. IranianOil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh, who previously had said Iranwould never agree to sharing an equal quota with Iraq, flew to IranFriday morning to seek agreement from his government to do just that.   To win agreement, the ministers apparently agreed to allow Iranto pump more oil, while most of the remaining countries would cutoutput to meet the new overall ceiling.   The ministers scheduled a meeting for Saturday evening for aformal vote on the pact.   Asked if he thought the proposed agreement would be ratified,Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer sounded cautious. ``I hopeso, yes,'' he replied.   The oil minister for the United Arab Emirates, Mana Saeed Otaiba,also left to consult with his president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan alNahyan, who was in Rabat, Morocco. The UAE is one of several OPECmembers that have been openly violating their quotas.   The proposed agreement calls for OPEC to sharply cut itsproduction from an estimated 22.5 million barrels a day currently to18.5 million barrels a day in the first six months of the year. Theaim is to reduce the glut of crude oil on the world market andbolster prices.   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, said thecartel ``will try to achieve that (the benchmark price) as quicklyas possible.''   ``I think we can reach that within a few months,'' he said.   But Fergus MacLeod, an oil analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd inLondon, said he doubted the price of West Texas Intermediate, themajor U.S. crude grade, would climb beyond $17 a barrel.   In London, the price for January delivery of Brent, the benchmarkNorth Sea crude, shot up $1.67 a barrel to $14.42. It had beentrading below $12 a barrel before the OPEC meeting.   The New York Mercantile Exchange was closed Thursday and Fridayfor the Thanksgiving holiday so there was no trading in West TexasIntermediate. The January contract for that grade rose 11 cents abarrel to $13.97 on Wednesday.   Analysts predicted the OPEC accord would have only a minimalimpact on consumers.   Ian Graham, an analyst at the London investment firm CountyNatWest, noted that oil companies had not lowered gasoline pricesduring the recent slump in crude oil prices.   ``There seems little justification for increasing them on the wayback up,'' he said.   MacLeod also said he doubted oil companies would try to pass anincrease through to the retail level.   The tentative accord was announced late Thursday after a week ofinformal, private negotiating sessions at OPEC's annual wintermeeting. Much of the talking was aimed at resolving the bitterdispute between Iran and Iraq, which ended an 8-year war in August.   Iraq demanded an equal production quota in any new accord withIran, but Aghazadeh said Iran would never agree to that. Iraq hadrefused to abide by the previous production agreement because it wasnot given parity with Iran.   OPEC did not release details of the tentative agreement, but oneprovision would give Iran and Iraq the same daily production quotaof 2.64 million barrels without diminishing Iran's demand to retaina 14 percent share of OPEC's total output. Under the currentproduction agreement, Iran had a quota of 2.4 million barrels.   Analysts calculated Saudi Arabia would have a quota of about 4.52million barrels a day under the new proposal, up from 4.35 millionbarrels in the existing accord. That would be a sharp drop from the6 million barrels that Saudi Arabia is thought to have been pumpingrecently.   The United Arab Emirates, which has been greatly exceeding itscurrent ceiling of 948,000 barrels a day, would get a new cap of986,000, according to an estimate by MacLeod.</TEXT></DOC>
