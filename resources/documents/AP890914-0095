(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former state Senate President DanTonkovich pleaded guilty today to taking a $5,000 payoff from acasino company to help get a bill legalizing gambling passed.   The surprise plea was announced by U.S. Attorney Michael Carey onthe sixth day of Tonkovich's trial.   Since July, West Virginia's treasurer, attorney general, a formerSenate majority leader and Tonkovich's successor as Senate presidenthave also either resigned, pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guiltyin various investigations.   The 16-year legislator had been charged with three counts ofextortion, two of attempted extortion and one of racketeering.   He pleaded guilty to one count of extortion carrying up to 20years in prison and $250,000 in fines. A conviction on all countscould have brought the Democrat from Benwood 120 years in prison and$1.5 million in fines.   Sentencing was set for Nov. 16.   A teary-eyed Tonkovich walked out of the courtroom with his wifeafter the announcement and declined to comment.   Tonkovich was indicted on three counts of extorting $5,000 eachfrom the West Virginia Casino Co. to help win passage of a bill thatwould have allowed casino gambling in West Virginia. It never passed.   After he was indicted, Tonkovich admitted he took the money butsaid he thought it was for polling work to be done his publicrelations firm.   He said he eventually returned the money because the casinocompany never followed up on its original request for polling workand because of editorial criticism about his business dealings.   One of the attempted extortion counts alleged that Tonkovichtried to sell his influence on the gambling bill to ResortsInternational Inc. in 1986. The other attempted extortion countcharged that Tonkovich promised to fix insurance-industrylegislation in 1988 in return for political donations.   The racketeering count alleged that Tonkovich used his office asa criminal enterprise by selling his influence.   Tonkovich was elected to the House in 1972 and the Senate in1976, serving as Senate president from 1984 to 1988. He did not seekre-election in 1988 to seek the Democratic nomination for governor.He lost to now-Gov. Gaston Caperton.   Three people testified against Tonkovich after pleading guilty totax charges: former administrative assistant Robert Cain, formerSenate Majority Leader Si Boettner, and insurance lobbyist BonnieWymer.   Former state Senate President Larry Tucker was the lead defensewitness. He resigned Sept. 8 after agreeing to plead guilty toextortion.   In July, state Treasurer A. James Manchin resigned over $270million in investment losses, averting a Senate impeachment trial.Attorney General Charlie Brown quit Aug. 21, averting a federalgrand jury investigation of campaign finances and allegations helied during a child custody hearing.</TEXT></DOC>
