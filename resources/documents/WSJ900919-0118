If war comes, this flat andfeatureless desert plain will be its first killing field andthe odd assortment of Arab and Islamic forces massed herewill be its likeliest first casualties. Eventually, troopspromised by Arab and Islamic nations could match the scale ofthe U.S. buildup in Saudi Arabia. But such forces have beenslow to deploy, and so far the purpose of those who havearrived seems more symbolic than strategic. &quot;It's importantin the Middle East that Arabs see their own people beinggiven a responsible part of the task,&quot; says Don Kerr, a SaudiArabia expert in London. &quot;Being at the front line -- thetripwire, if you like -- is a very responsible role.&quot;   By pushing these troops to the front line, Iraqi soldiersare compelled to stare into the faces of their Moslembrothers rather than at the massed might of the U.S. militarymachine. But the mirror works two ways here, and the longdesert days have given Arab troops on this side of the borderplenty of time to contemplate combat with their Iraqicounterparts. A tour of these northern border positionsreveals widely differing views -- between senior commandersand junior officers, between Egyptians, Saudis and Kuwaitis-- about exactly what they have come here to do, and what theoutcome might be.   This is mirage country, where the landscape is softenedonly by illusions. Tricks of light deposit shimmering sheetsof water in the distance, and set army trucks afloat on them.Apart from man-made intrusions such as tents and sandbaggedartillery, the only relief for the eye is an occasionalcamel, marking the horizon like a squiggle of Arabiccalligraphy.   The young Saudi air-force captain feels at home in thisbleakness, a lot more at home than he did a few weeks ago inAlabama, where he completed advanced training in flyingBlackhawk helicopters. In his U.S.-style desert camouflage,there is little to distinguish him from an American soldier.But there is an edge to his voice, and it betrays anuneasiness with his new American brothers-in-arms.   &quot;Americans lead very closed-in lives,&quot; he says. InAlabama, he recalls, &quot;someone asked me if Saudi Arabia was inCalifornia.&quot; He wonders if such people know what they are upagainst, thousands of miles from home. And most of all, hewonders whether he doesn't have more in common with his Iraqienemy than with his American ally.   The Americans, he says, &quot;are complaining about the heateven though the weather these days is nice for this desert.They say they want to fight and get it over with. Me, I don'twant it, and {the Iraqis} don't want it. My family's villageis just a few miles from the Iraqi border. We are the samereligion, same language, same people. Believe me, I knowthem, and I know that fighting them won't be so easy.&quot; Thecaptain's great hope is that the Iraqis will have the courageto overthrow their leader, and that the Americans will havethe patience to wait for that to happen.   Saudi ambivalence about fighting alongside Americans hasits faint echoes in the Saudi government's official rhetoric.Describing the foreign troops in Saudi Arabia, governmentstatements invariably use the formulation, &quot;Arab, Islamic andfriendly forces,&quot; which, given the current ratio of U.S. toArab and Islamic ground troops (about five to one) is aboutlike trying to hide the bulk of the White House behind aspindly minaret. &quot;It's nonsense,&quot; admits one Saudi official.&quot;Eventually I think it will find its way into the garbagealong with all the rhetoric about `fraternal Iraq.'&quot;   While some Saudis worry about the tenacity of Americans,their own forces -- untested in war -- are perhaps a greaterunknown. These include an army of 38,000 and a National Guardof 56,000 currently swelling with new recruits. Just ahundred years ago, the very thought of Arabia's desertwarriors -- who never succumbed to colonial conquerers --inspired dread in their neighbors. The journals of theBritish explorer, Charles Doughty, are full of the direwarnings he received from Arab friends on the eve of his 1877journey to the region. &quot;If one goes into Arabia, he shouldcarry his shroud under his arm,&quot; said one. Warned another:&quot;Why cast your life away? You know them not. But we knowthem. The Bedouins are fiends.&quot;   Today's highly urbanized Saudis, although well-trained andequipped with the best that money can buy, are two or threegenerations removed from the hard men who waged tribal war onthese sands. At a mobile field hospital set up behind thefront lines, a Saudi dermatologist named Abed al-Twerki listsphotodermatitis -- otherwise known as sunburn -- as among thebiggest health problems so far. An Arab, he says &quot;is nodifferent to an American. If you take people from the citiesand you bring them to the desert, every day you'll get casesof headache, sunburn or stomach pains&quot; until they adjust.   Further north, at a Saudi tank-brigade encampment, theofficers' quarters occupy a large, fabric-lined tent, fittedout in the traditional style of a desert sheik with orientalcarpets and bolsters. A TV set sits on an ice-filled cooleralongside a touchtone phone. &quot;You can dial America directfrom here,&quot; a Saudi soldier boasts. Lunch -- fried chicken,grilled quail, rice, french fries, salad, shaslik, stuffedcourgettes and 7-Up -- arrives by helicopter from the giantnorthern base, King Khalid Military City, and is dished outby Filipino waiters.   The Saudis have some 15,000 of their own troops in thenorthern region. Alongside them are 2,000 Egyptian commandos,1,200 Moroccans, 3,000 Syrians, 2,000 men each from Pakistanand Bangladesh and around 5,000 Kuwaitis. Some of the Islamicnations also have troops elsewhere in Saudi Arabia -- allmassed against much larger forces across the border. &quot;We camehere because we are ready for them; numbers don't make adifference to us,&quot; says Brig. Gen. Turki al-Nefie, commandingthe Saudis' 20th Mechanized Brigade from a sandbagged bunker.   But Western military analysts aren't as confident. &quot;Withthe exception of Egypt and Syria, who have armor on the way,everyone else is pretty cosmetic,&quot; says a Western diplomat inRiyadh. The Saudis have beeen &quot;inundated&quot; by offers of troopsfrom small Third World countries, he says. &quot;But if combatbreaks out we are talking about a desert tank campaign shadesof World War II in Libya, and while token armed forces mighthave an important political role, in a military sense 1,000Bangladeshi riflemen aren't the answer to that.&quot;   The Syrians, despite the size of their commitment, haveproved the most publicity-shy of all. About once a week,Saudi officials organize visits to the various Arab armies,ferrying journalists north by transport planes, buses andfour-wheel-drive vehicles. According to the Saudis, theSyrians have sent special-forces commandos dispatched fromassignment on the Golan Heights, Syria's contested borderwith Israel. &quot;The Syrians just took their position today, andthey're too busy for us to see them,&quot; explains a Saudi escortofficer, as a press bus accelerated past what appeared to bea Syrian encampment adjacent to the Saudi front line. &quot;Butthat's exactly what you told us last week,&quot; an Americanjournalist grumbles.   Saudi officials say they have designed a command structurethat quarantines Syrians and other Arab forces from U.S.control. The degree of coordination between Saudis andAmericans, and between the various Arab forces, remainsunclear. Brig. Gen. al-Nefie says &quot;there are no Americans atall&quot; in his northern command area, but adds that an Americanofficer occasionally visits his forward command post. As forthe nearby Syrian forces, he says, &quot;when we have neighboringunits we always coordinate between commanders to cover gaps.&quot;   But barriers to coordination in combat are potentiallynightmarish here. Syrians fight according to Soviet doctrine;Saudis use U.S. tactics. Saudis and Moroccans speak suchdifferent Arabic dialects that they can barely understandeach other. Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Arab troops have tocommunicate with each other in English. The Saudis shrug offsuch difficulties, saying that liaison officers are workingout any problems.   While the Arab and Islamic forces haven't brought thehigh-tech weaponry of the Americans, many have come armedwith battle experience. The Moroccans have fought a longdesert war with Polisario guerrillas in the Western Sahara,and the Egyptians and Syrians have bitter experience inbattle against the Israelis. Some of these veterans, havingseen the U.S. driven from Vietnam and Lebanon, doubt Americanstaying power in a vicious contest with war-hardened Iraqis.   For the most part, American troops are having littlecontact with their Arab counterparts, even on bases far fromthe border. Some seem torn between the urge to get to knowtheir Arabian hosts and the fear instilled by years of seeingArabs as terrorist threats to U.S. military personnel. Just afew yards separate American and Saudi crews maintaining theirown air force's fighter planes in a vast hangar at King AbdulAziz Airbase. But the work schedule is too grueling to allowfor chat, and off duty the only point of contact is theairbase gym. So far, says one 22-year-old airman, most U.S.personnel haven't been allowed off-base, and that suits himfine. He fears becoming a terrorist target if he venturesinto town. &quot;I'm planning to go home,&quot; he says.   At the northern front, it is the senior officers --Kuwaiti and Saudi -- who are most eager to fight Iraq. &quot;For amilitary man like me, I wish we could transfer the order fromdefense to offense -- waiting isn't good,&quot; says Gen. Mohammedal-Sheri, logistics commander of the northern sector. He, atleast, isn't awed by Iraqi fighting prowess. The general isamong the few who have had contact with Iraqi deserters.After a conversation with three of them, he says, &quot;I knowtheir morale: They are dead.&quot; He says their rations weremainly dirty flour and their gas masks were so old andill-fitting &quot;they wouldn't even keep dust out, much lesschemicals.&quot;   He describes his own troops' morale, by contrast, as&quot;wonderful,&quot; despite a barrage of Iraqi propaganda carefullyaimed at both Arab and American troops. Iraqi radiobroadcasts attempt to both goad the Americans with tales ofGulf shieks seducing American women and reassure them thatIraq respects Christians. But the broadcasts also tell Arabtroops of U.S. soldiers cavorting with Arab women inside thegates of the holy mosques at Mecca and Medina and derideChristians as infidels. Since many of the Arab troops speakfluent English, such contradictory broadcasts create hilarityrather than the hoped-for horror.   Yet Gen. al-Sheri says such efforts shouldn't be entirelyshrugged off. &quot;Iraqis are good at propaganda,&quot; he says. &quot;Ican admit it because we were deceived by them.&quot; During theIran-Iraq war, he says, &quot;I took from my own salary to give tothe Iraqis, and I saved from my own food.&quot; Just six monthsearlier, he says, he proudly shook Saddam Hussein's hand whenthe Iraqi leader was an honored guest at King Khalid MilitaryCity. &quot;He said, `We now are building a very strong army, andit's good for the whole Arab nation.' And we believed itall,&quot; says the general, shaking his head.   Egyptians, too, strongly supported Iraq during the Gulfwar. The government sent arms and some Egyptians evenvolunteered to fight alongside Iraqis. At a camp guarded bystern troops armed with fixed bayonets, Col. AbdulrahamanMohammed Sayyed heads 2,000 Egyptian commandos, some of whomsaw combat against Israel in 1973.   But the Egyptian commander isn't forthcoming when askedhow his men see their current enmity with Iraq. At first, hetries to brush off the question by saying none of the menunder his command volunteered to fight with Iraq againstIran. Asked again, he replies that &quot;we are not fighting now;we are defending the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&quot; Questionedfurther, he states: &quot;The unit here is made up of professionalcareer soldiers who, once given orders, will execute theorders regardless who the enemy is.&quot;   Outside, as troops file out of their tents for weaponsdrill, a young captain named Mohammed Adel Fettah bluntlystates that his mission is defensive. &quot;We as Arabs andMoslems under Islam know that no Arab should attack an Arabbrother, no Moslem should attack another Moslem. That's allthere is to it,&quot; he says. &quot;We won't make war on Iraq, but ifthey enter Saudi Arabia, then we will defend it.&quot;   As the Arab forces wait in the desert for a battle manyhope won't happen, the Saudis face the growing task ofmeeting all the logistical needs for the assortment offorces. Fortunately, says Gen. al-Sheri, some bought theirown spare parts, so the Saudis don't have immediate problemschasing supplies for the Syrians' Soviet weapons or theMoroccans' Spanish-made vehicles. But some odd orders arebeing filled: the Egyptians report that the Saudis somehoware supplying them with their national dish -- &quot;molokia&quot; -- aslimy green vegetable scooped up on Arabic bread. While theEgyptian troops don't share the Americans' degree ofdiscomfort with the desert, they are equally beset byboredom. To fill free time, they play soccer and, as thecomedians of the Arab world, concoct daring political jokesabout the current sorry state of Arabian politics.   Asked to share one, an Egyptian colonel, Wagdu Abde,glances toward the nearby Saudis and declines with a grin.&quot;If you come to Cairo I will tell you,&quot; he says.   ---           Arab and Islamic Troops in Saudi Arabia                                                                                                                                                 FORCES NOW IN     COUNTRY                              SAUDI ARABIA                                                                                                            Egypt*                                  5,000                                                                                                            Morocco                                 2,000     Syria*                                  3,000                                                                                                            Pakistan                                2,000                                                                                                            Bangladesh                              5,000                                                                                                            Four Gulf Shiekdoms                     3,000                                                                                                            Kuwait           Unknown remnants of army and                                         air force                                                                                                            Saudi Arabia             94,000 ground troops                               16,000 in air force                                                                                                            *10,000 troops additionally pledged                                                                                                            Source: State Department</TEXT></DOC>
