(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal grand jury today indicted twoassociates of Jim Bakker for lying during the PTL fraudinvestigation.   Sam Johnson, former minister at Heritage Village Church, wascharged with 12 counts of perjury for his testimony about a $10,000check that was part of $265,000 in hush money paid to former churchsecretary Jessica Hahn.   Evangelist John Wesley Fletcher was charged with one count ofperjury for his testimony about how Bakker was introduced to MissHahn.   ``There will be no further PTL-related indictments coming outthis grand jury,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller.   Fletcher introduced Bakker to Miss Hahn before their sexualencounter at a Florida motel room. Reports that Bakker usedministry funds to pay Miss Hahn to keep quiet about the liaison ledto Bakker's resignation in March 1987.   Johnson, who runs Heritage Ministries of Charlotte, thenon-profit ministry created by a federal bankruptcy court after thedecline of PTL, was not immediately available for comment. Hissecretary, Pam Jewett, said Johnson was taping a Christmas TVspecial at a resort in the North Carolina mountains.   ``We were very surprised'' by the indictment, she said.   Fletcher, who was arrested twice within four hours last week ondrunken driving charges in Durham, where he lives, could not beimmediately located for comment.   The indictments were issued about three hours after RichardDortch, Jim Bakker's former second-in-command at the bankruptministry, arrived at the federal courthouse.   Dortch, who pleaded guilty in August to fraud and conspiracycharges for his role in the PTL affair, would not comment on thegrand jury as he entered the courthouse with his son, RichardDortch Jr.   Asked if he would talk with reporters after his appearance,Dortch said, ``Silence is wisdom.'' Dortch's attorney, MarkCalloway, also made no comment.   As expected, the new grand jury probe focused on people whoallegedly committed perjury in appearances before the special grandjury that indicted Dortch and Bakker a year ago. The originalindictments in the PTL case were handed down on Dec. 5, 1988.   Bakker is serving a 45-year term in a federal prison inMinnesota after being convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges.Bakker is appealing the conviction, but a panel of the 4th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals refused to free Bakker on bond while theappeal was prepared.   On Oct. 5, Bakker was convicted by a jury on all 24 counts offraud and conspiracy for bilking faithful followers who sent him$158 million for ``partnerships'' in the ministry entitling them toannual lodging guarantees. Prosecutors said Bakker diverted $3.7million in PTL money to buy expensive homes, cars, jewelry andvacations.   Dortch was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined$200,000. His plea agreement enables the former Assemblies of Godminister to remain free until federal authorities no longer requirehis cooperation. The plea agreement for Dortch included a provisionthat he would be required to report to prison no sooner than Jan.15 as long as he cooperated with prosecutors.   The fate of the ministry's Heritage USA religious theme park andhotel complex is in the hands of a bankruptcy court judge inColumbia, S.C. The complex, in Fort Mill, S.C., south of Charlotte,has closed.</TEXT></DOC>
