The stores, 45 in Connecticut and five in western Massachusetts, were struck Tuesday by the locals, 919 and 371, which represent about 7,500 workers in the stores. The locals, which have been working without a contract since Feb. 6, had sought job security assurances in Stop andamp; Shop's planned $1.23 billion buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.    Union officials had said they wanted a new contract that would bind the New York leveraged buy-out specialists from cost-cutting measures at the workers' expense. The workers were scheduled to vote on ratification of the tentative agreement late last night in Hartford and New Haven, Conn.    Arnaldo Espinosa, president of local 919, said last night the union voted unanimously to accept the agreement. He said the contract included language that would bind Kohlberg Kravis to terms including raises of about 5% a year for Stop andamp; Shop workers.    Three other locals of the union, representing about 10,000 workers in the company's stores in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, have voted to strike on Sunday unless an agreement is reached. A Stop andamp; Shop spokeswoman said the company expects to resume negotiations with those locals later this week.    Stop andamp; Shop Cos. also operates Bradlees discount department stores. </TEXT></DOC>
