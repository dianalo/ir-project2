In the process, they letthe home crowd know that they won't be intimidated this season.;   &quot;Hey,they're a division rival and we're going to have to take it to them,&quot; Sharksright wing Jeff Madill said. &quot;Teams are going to come in here and we're goingto have to make them pay. They're going to know they were in a game. This isour rink, and when you come in here, you're going to have to play Sharkhockey.&quot;;   Left wing Perry Anderson got the tough stuff started byhigh-sticking Vancouver's Jim Agnew 12 minutes, 45 seconds into the game. Andwhen Vancouver's Robin Bawa went after Anderson, the Cow Palace crowd got itsfirst look at Saturday night at the fights.;   But if the Anderson-Bawa boutwasn't entertaining enough, there was Agnew and Madill fighting their way intothe Vancouver bench.;   And there was more. Later in the period, Link Gaetz,the Sharks' main heavyweight, tangled with Vancouver's Shawn Antoski in theevening's main event. Gaetz was a clear winner in his fight, which put thecrowd in a frenzy.;   &quot;They were a little bit cocky and I thought it was timeto set the tone,&quot; Gaetz said.;   Sharks Coach George Kingston said he hadn'tintended for the game to start out as physically as it did. But he also saidthe Sharks won't be a team that backs down.;   &quot;From my point of view, weweren't looking for that kind of a game,&quot; Kingston said. &quot;But on the otherhand, we have a team that will answer the bell.&quot;;   When the teams playedhockey, Sharks right wing Pat Falloon, a first-round pick in June's entrydraft, showed that he can play at the NHL level.;   Falloon, 18, gave theSharks a 3-2 lead when he scored at the 14:25 mark of the second period.Falloon, who skated on a line with center Mark Pavelich and left wing J.F.Quintin, missed an empty net late in the game, but recovered the puck in timeto set up Quintin for the empty net goal that put the game away.;   Earlier,Falloon was credited with an assist on a power-play goal by Quintin that gavethe Sharks a 4-2 lead early in the third period. Quintin's goal was the thirdpower-play strike for the Sharks.;   For his efforts, Falloon was named theNo. 2 star of the game behind Sharks goalie Artur Irbe.;   &quot;It was greatfeeling to be out there,&quot; said Falloon, who still hasn't signed a contractwith the Sharks. &quot;I was a little nervous, but I didn't feel out of place.&quot;;  The Canucks, who beat the Sharks 6-5 in overtime in Vancouver Friday night,pulled to within 4-3 when Jason Herter scored at the 12:04 mark of the thirdperiod. But Steve Bozek answered for the Sharks at 14:36 to seal the firstvictory in franchise history.;   Brian Hayward was the starting goalie for theSharks and stopped seven of eight shots in the first period, which ended withthe Sharks holding a 1-0 lead.;   But Hayward pulled a groin muscle and wasreplaced by Irbe at the start of the second period. Irbe got off to a badstart when Petr Nedved scored 15 seconds into the period, but Irbe wasflawless for the remainder of the period, stopping the other 12 shots hefaced.;   Irbe also stopped seven of the eight shots he faced in the thirdperiod, but said he didn't feel deserving of the No. 1 star honor.;   &quot;I thinkthe No. 1 star was Pat Falloon,&quot; Irbe said. &quot;The first shot against me, I wasnot so good.&quot;;   For the Sharks, that was about the only thing that wasn'tgood.; ETC.: The Sharks will take today off and then practice Monday at 10a.m. and 11:45 a.m. at the Cow Palace. Each session will be open free to thepublic. . . . A team of Sharks rookies skated to a 3-2 victory over a team ofLos Angeles Kings rookies Saturday afternoon at the Cow Palace.
