The failed banks were Bank of North America, Houston, which had assets of $33.3 million; and Citizens Bank of Glendale, Denver, which had assets of $3.7 million.    The FDIC transferred the insured deposits held by Bank of North America to Texas Commerce Bank-Southeast Branch, also in Houston. The agency said it wasn't able to determine the potential losses of the failed bank. Bank of North America held $30 million in 5,135 deposit accounts, including about $512,000 in 60 accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor.    Owners of uninsured deposits will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the failed bank's assets. Bank of North America was the 36th bank to fail in Texas this year.    Citizens' office, closed by the state bank commissioner, was scheduled to reopen today as a branch of Prudential Bank, also of Denver. Citizens, which held deposits of $3.1 million in 1,178 accounts, was the ninth Colorado bank to fail this year. </TEXT></DOC>
