After all, this supposedly savvy group of chief executives,directors and major shareholders gave no warning whatsoever lastyear that the market was headed for a crash.   Nevertheless, since that debacle insiders have been buyingstocks of their companies at a furious pace. And the market hasrecovered some of the ground it lost last fall.   ``The rally has now progressed for more than half a year,''observed Norman Fosback, editor of the investment advisory letterThe Insiders, which defines its subjects as ``America's mostknowledgeable investors.''   ``Throughout this recovery,'' Fosback adds, ``the insiders havecorrectly been flashing bright and clear signals that the marketoutlook was bullish.''   Insiders tend to acquire much of the stock they hold in theircompanies through private arrangements such as corporate incentiveplans. Thus, their activity in the open market, which they mustpublicly report, is skewed toward sales rather than purchases.   By Fosback's ``insider indicator,'' the normal level ofinsiders' buying is 35 percent of their total open markettransactions. A particularly bullish reading occurs whenever thepercentage gets to 50 or more.   Immediately after the crash, it surged above 90 percent, and atthe end of 1987 it stood at 79.   ``Since those on-the-money buy signals, the insider barometershave gradually eased'' to around 50 percent, Fosback says.   ``But an objective reading shows that they now stand very closeto the levels that signaled many a major market rally in the 1970sand early 1980s. The outlook today, in other words, is bullish.''   Most headlines about insider trading focus on stories of illegalbuying or selling based on information that hasn't yet been madepublic. The activity Fosback and other analysts track, however, islegal, and presumably reflects the special sensitivity insidershave to their companies' prospects.   Aaron Feigen, who publishes a newsletter known as The InsiderOutlook, adds that insiders are forced to look beyond short-termmarket fluctuations.   ``Insiders are the only group of investors who are required bylaw to be long-term investors,'' he says. ``Government regulationsdictate that insiders must hold their purchases for at least sixmonths before selling them for a profit.   ``Because of this regulation, insiders cannot take intoconsideration the current mood or direction of the market. Instead,when they buy they are focused on the `special situations' at theircompanies.   ``They expect to make substantial future capital gains _ morethan they could get elsewhere and with more certainty. And theyhave an excellent track record for doing this successfully.''   If any outsiders want to base their investment strategies onwhat insiders are doing, Feigen suggests, they need to be preparedto be patient, for an indeterminate and sometimes very long time.   ``Although you can be certain that the insider is investing inanticipation of a profitable return at some time in the future, youcan't tell what timetable he has in mind for achieving hisprofits,'' Feigen says.   ``There is no pattern that narrowly defines the length of timethat all insiders follow when accumulating their stock.   ``In many cases, the insider buying is concentrated within arelatively short time period _ a year or less. But other times itcan go on for years.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon July 25</NOTE></DOC>
