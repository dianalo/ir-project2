Musgrave.   The real solution to the budget problem, insists Musgrave, anauthority on public finance, is the old-fashioned one: an increasein the individual income tax. And he wants more than higher ratesthat hit the wealthy _ he is calling for restricting the mortgageinterest deduction and for repealing the writeoff for charitablecontributions.   ``We cannot resolve the federal budget crisis without raisingtaxes,'' Musgrave, author of ``The Theory of Public Finance,'' saidin a report issued Saturday.   ``There is not enough scope for responsible program cuts whilepaying for the savings-and-loan bailout and beginning to addressthe growing backlog of unmet needs in education, child care, theenvironment and public infrastructure,'' he wrote.   ``Increased revenue is needed and should be drawn from thepersonal income tax,'' Musgrave said in a report released by theEconomic Policy Institute, a research group financed by labor,business and foundations. Musgrave is a professor at the Universityof California at Santa Cruz and Harvard professor-emeritus.   Congress and President Bush agree there will be no general taxincrease to reduce the deficit during the budget year that beginsOct. 1. The president prefers a ``flexible freeze'' on spending _Congress would not go along _ and such ``revenue enhancements'' asextending the expiring tax on telephone service and blocking ascheduled decline in taxes on air tickets and shipments.   It remains to be seen whether Bush a year from now will abandonhis campaign promise against any tax increase. While there is awidespread feeling in Congress that higher taxes will have to beenacted by Oct. 1, 1990, few lawmakers are calling for majorchanges in the massive 1986 tax overhaul.   Musgrave is.   ``The proposition that the income tax `must not be touched'because it has been the subject of recent reform has politicalappeal but little substance,'' Musgrave wrote. ``On the contrary:The need to provide for additional revenue and to do so promptlyshould make use of the improved tax, rather than worsen the taxsystem by resorting to inferior revenue sources or the addition ofa new and complex tax.''   Raising excise taxes _ the ``sin taxes'' that Congress talksabout _ would be unfair to lower-income Americans and provideinsufficient revenue for deficit reductions, Musgrave says.Imposing a national sales tax, known as a value-added tax, woulddiscriminate against larger families, require a new bureaucracy toadminister and preempt a traditional state revenue source, he adds.   The individual income tax, which already provides 40 percent offederal revenues, ``remains superior to other proven taxes andpreferable to most alternatives which have been proposed,''Musgrave says.   The income tax is highly visible, ``a steady reminder of thequality of public service that should be provided in return,'' thereport argues. It permits tax liabilities to be adjusted to thetaxpayer's ability to pay and to family size. And, since the 1986overhaul, the income tax has people with similar incomes payingsimilar taxes.   But the new law can be improved, making it fairer and providingsizable revenue to reduce the deficit, Musgrave contends. Hisproposals, which could wipe out the deficit in one year:   _Raise the 33-percent top individual tax bracket, which affectsupper-income taxpayers, to 40 percent and impose a new set ofgraduated rates that would hit some middle-income families.   _Limit the amount of home mortgage interest that can be deducted.   _Repeal the deduction for charitable contributions.   _Tax interest on state and local bonds.   _Tax a portion of the money contributed to pensions, healthinsurance and other employer-financed benefits.   _Impose capital-gains taxes at death on the increase in value ofproperty during the owner's lifetime.</TEXT></DOC>
