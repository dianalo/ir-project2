TheMMS believes that the rules need clarification to assure that the itemsof data and information submitted on Forms MMS-1866, Request for ReservoirMaximum Efficient Rate; MMS-1867, Request for Well Maximum Production Rate;MMS-1868, Well Potential Test Report; MMS-1869, Quarterly Oil Well TestReport; and MMS-1870, Semiannual Gas Well Test Report that are made availablefor public inspection are clearly identified in the regulations.

Section250.18 specifies periods of time that certain geological and geophysicaldata and information will be protected from disclosure to the public. Section250.18(d) identifies specific items of data and information on Forms MMS-330,MMS-331, and MMS-331C which are to be protected from disclosure for thespecified time periods. The release dates for data and information on otherMMS reporting forms are not mentioned in 30 CFR part 250. This apparentinconsistency makes it necessary to determine whether data and informationsubmitted on Forms MMS-1866, MMS-1867, MMS-1868, MMS-1869, or MMS-1870should be available for public inspection when similar data or informationis protected from disclosure for specified periods of time under andSection;250.18 when submitted on Forms MMS-330, MMS-331, or MMS-331C.Under OCS Order No. 12, Public Inspection of Records, which was rescindedby the <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice published April 1, 1988 (53 FR 10596),lessees were advised regarding the release of specific data and informationand the specified time periods that certain data and information wouldbe protected from disclosure. The provisions of andSection; 250.18 are notas inclusive and specific as OCS Order No. 12.Under revised Part 250, the Gulf of Mexico OCS Region issued further guidancein the form of a Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL). The NTL 88-03 wasissued on June 29, 1988, and provided an interpretation on the releaseof data and information which is to be made available to the public. TheMMS is considering the need for additional specificity in the regulationswhich became effective May 31, 1988. Revision of the governing regulationswould ensure that data and information are made available to the publicon a uniform basis in all OCS Regions. Use of the rulemaking process topropose a revision of the governing rule will provide the public an opportunityto provide comments concerning the release of data and information to thepublic.This proposed rule would amend andSection; 250.18 to identify specific itemsof data and information which are submitted on MMS reporting Forms MMS-1866and MMS-1868 and the specific timetables for the release of that data andinformation to the public. The proposed rule also provides that all dataand information submitted on Forms MMS-1867, MMS-1869, and MMS-1870 wouldbe available for public inspection. The treatment and timetables for releaseof protected data and information under the proposed rule are generallyconsistent with the treatment of similar data and information under theregulations in effect prior to May 31, 1988, as interpreted by OCS OrderNo. 12. Under OCS Order No. 12, information (other than that which wasclearly geological) submitted on Forms MMS-330, MMS-331, and MMS-331C wasmade available to the public after the well went on production. Under thecurrent rule, the release of data and information is not triggered by thecommencement of production. The proposed rule does not change this situation.The proposed rule would allow release of data and information submittedon production Forms MMS-1869 and 1870 upon receipt, while similar informationsubmitted on operating Form MMS-330 would be protected from disclosureuntil the applicable time period for protection expired. Comments are specificallyrequested on this aspect of the rule.Interested persons wishing to comment on the proposed rule should forwardwritten comments to the address specified above.The Department of the Interior (DOI) has determined that this rule proposesto codify existing practices and will not have any effect on the economyand is not a major rule.The DOI has determined that this rule will not have a significant economiceffect on small entities since offshore activities are complex undertakingsgenerally engaged in by enterprises that are not considered small entities.The DOI certifies that the rule does not represent a Government actioncapable of interference with constitutionally protected property rights.Thus, a Taking Implication Assessment has not been prepared pursuant toExecutive Order 12630, Government Action and Interference with ConstitutionallyProtected Property Rights.This proposed rule does not affect any information collection which requiresapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3><T3>Author: </T3>This document was prepared by John V.
