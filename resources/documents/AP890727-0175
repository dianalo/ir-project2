Usry, a reformistcandidate swept into office on the heels of a political corruptionscandal, was arrested Thursday on charges of bribery, conspiracyand official misconduct.   Twelve other people, including the City Council president, thechairman of the zoning board and the former housing authoritydirector, also were arrested after an investigation that oneofficial said showed this seaside resort was ``up for sale.''   ``Our investigation uncovered the deplorable circumstances inwhich corruption has reached the highest levels of Atlantic Citymunicipal government,'' state police Superintendent Col. Clinton L.Pagano said at a news conference.   Usry, 67, was elected mayor five years ago after his predecessorwas implicated in an influence-peddling scandal and lost a recallelection. Usry is also president of the National Conference ofBlack Mayors.   State Attorney General Peter Perretti Jr. said none of thecharges or investigations against Usry and the others involved thecasino industry.   A criminal complaint against the suspects, including a 14thperson not yet arrested, alleged five separate but overlappingconspiracies. Among them was an attempt to gain control of alucrative Boardwalk electric cart business and a gift shopfranchise at the Atlantic City International Airport.   Usry was charged with bribery, conspiracy, official misconductand accepting unlawful gifts.   The mayor said nothing in court during a bail hearing; neitherhe nor his attorney acknowledged reporters' questions afterward.Usry and the other city officials were released on their ownrecognizance.   Usry and others do not have to forfeit their public offices onthe basis of a criminal complaint, Perretti said. Attorneys fromthe state Division of Criminal Justice are expected to present acase to a state grand jury within several weeks.   Before state police began their roundup Thursday morning, theyfirst went to Usry's home with a search warrant. Police confiscated$6,000 in cash, alleged to be conspiracy money, Pagano said.   Searches were also conducted at the home of another of thosearrested and at two offices belonging to others charged in thecase. Books, records and documents were confiscated from thoseplaces, Pagano said.   The arrests resulted from an investigation that began inNovember, prompted by a complaint by Atlantic City businessmanAlbert Black, the attorney general said. Black said some cityofficials had demanded a bribe from him to get a business proposalapproved by the zoning board.   The initial investigation involved bribery and influencepeddling by some members of the City Council and zoning board,officials said. That probe led to investigations against the mayorand others on similar charges.   ``The complaints filed this morning in Atlantic County SuperiorCourt charge that the regulation of economic activity in AtlanticCity, as administered by those arrested, has been up for sale,''Pagano said.   The others arrested Thursday included Walter Collette, 61, citycouncil president; Kaleem Shabazz, 52, chairman of the AtlanticCity zoning board; Lillian Bryant, 45, Atlantic County freeholder;Gene Dorn, 47, councilman; W. Oscar Harris Jr., 46, former directorof the Atlantic City Housing Authority; Harold Mosee, 47, formerAtlantic City councilman and an aide to Collette; and ArnoldOrsatti Jr., 46, chairman of the Atlantic City council'stransportation committee.   Also charged were Robert McCurdy, 46, former business partner ofHarris; Jack Wolf, 57, business consultant; Sylvetta Pilgrim, 44,administrative assistant with the city landlord-tenant affairsboard; Ernest English, 32, businessman; and Clarence Gillard, noage or occupation available.   Usry is in his second term as mayor. He won his first term onMay 13, 1984, the same day his predecessor, Michael Matthews, wasousted. Matthews was implicated in an influence-peddling schemeinvolving casino-zoned land and was sentenced to a 15-year prisonterm for extortion.   Usry was elected overwhelmingly with help from disgruntled whitevoters and the city's large black population. He was considered anally of Gov. Thomas H. Kean and a symbol of the ``politics ofinclusion'' that Kean has tried to make a hallmark of his career asa Republican politician.</TEXT></DOC>
