The measure was aimed at putting pressure on South Africa to endapartheid, that country's system of legalized racial segregation.It would have imposed mandatory worldwide sanctions, including anoil embargo, for a year.   It failed by a vote of 10-2, with France, West Germany and Japanabstaining.   Prior to the vote Tuesday, all speakers deplored whiteminority-led South Africa's state of emergency and recentrestrictions on anti-apartheid groups.   But British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell and U.S. AmbassadorHerbert Okun both told the council mandatory sanctions wouldcripple the chances for an ``internal'' dialogue in South Africa.   The West German envoy, Alexander Count York von Wartenburg, gavea similar reason for abstaining.   But he also warned South Africa that the West German abstentionis ``a signal that my government's patience is not inexhaustible.''   The French and Japanese envoys did not explain their abstention.   The resolution called for a one-year ban on export and sale ofoil to South Africa, on iron and steel imports, on the sale of allSouth African coins and on investment and loans. It also called foran end to all promotion and support for trade with South Africa.   The United States, Britain and West Germany have vetoed similarmeasures in the past. The United States and Britain are among thefive permanent members with veto power. The others are China,France and the Soviet Union.   African and Asian nations pushed hard for the sanctions topunish South Africa for its Feb. 24 ban on activities by major antianti-apartheid groups, and to force it to dismantle apartheid,under which the 26 million blacks have no say in national affairs.   South Africa's 5 million whites control the government and theeconomy and maintain separate districts, schools and healthservices.   The council members belonging to the movement of nationsprofessing non-alliance with either superpower _ Argentina, Nepal,Senegal, Yugoslavia and Zambia _ sponsored the resolution.</TEXT></DOC>
