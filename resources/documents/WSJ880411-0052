Under the plan, the first capital increase announced by a big Swiss concern in 1988, each holder of five bearer or registered shares will have the right to purchase one new share. Analysts said they expect the issue price to be about 6,000 francs a share ($4,337), about 2,000 francs below Jacobs's current stock price.    The company, which last month first announced its intention to launch a capital increase, said it will complete the terms, and decide on the price, of the increase at its general shareholders meeting April 26.    Last month, Jacobs's chairman, Klaus Jacobs, told a news conference that the company would pursue an aggressive expansion, restructuring and acquisition strategy in 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
