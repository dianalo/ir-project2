Independency of the power system enables measurementsat highly remote sites of solar generators for the purpose of acceptancetesting and surveillance. The simplicity of the unit provides ruggednessand reliability. An I-V characteristic, experimentally obtained at asolar generator, is presented.</TEXT></DOC>
