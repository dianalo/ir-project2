A Martin Marietta spokesman said the company was preparinganswers to a &quot;comprehensive list of questions&quot; submitted bythe FTC and received on March 20. The questions followed anearlier, less detailed inquiry in the proposed acquisiton, hesaid.</LP><TEXT>   The inquiries appear to reflect concern over competitionbetween Lockheed of Calabasas, Calif., Martin Marietta andVought Corp., as Lockheed and Martin Marietta have proposedto name the jointly owned company through which they wouldoperate the LTV aircraft and missile businesses. Dallas-basedLTV has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-courtprotection since 1986.   Martin Marietta said it didn't expect the latest FTC queryto delay the proposed acquisition. &quot;We did our homeworkcarefully before the offer,&quot; the spokesman said. Lockheed andMartin Marietta signed a definitive agreement with LTV latelast month to buy its aircraft and missile units, but the twocompanies are expecting a challenging bid by Carlyle Group, aWashington, D.C., group of investors, and Thomson CSF, aFrench electronics concern.   A Lockheed spokesman said the company considers the FTC's&quot;treatment of the matter serious but routine.&quot; He said LTV isbidding against Lockheed on several programs, but thatLockheed &quot;would expect there would be competitive activities&quot;after any acquisition.</TEXT></DOC>
