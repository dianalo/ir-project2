A wave of selling hit the market late in the afternoon yesterday, partly reflecting nervousness about a government report this morning on consumer prices. Prices of long-term government bonds, which had been up more than half a point earlier, ended with declines of about a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount.    The yield on some 30-year Treasury bonds, which surged above 9% Monday for the first time since mid-January, climbed to 9.04%. At the end of February, these issues yielded about 8.30%.    Today's report on consumer prices is expected to show an increase of 0.4%, according to the average estimate of 13 economists surveyed by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. But there were rumors late yesterday that the report will show a gain of 0.7% or 0.9%. Several traders agreed that an increase that large would jolt the bond markets, leading immediately to sharply higher interest rates.    Many bankers argue that inflation fears are exaggerated. &quot;The economy seems to be relatively strong, but there doesn't appear to be much in the way of inflation,&quot; said John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp. Speaking with reporters after the bank holding company's annual meeting yesterday, he added: &quot;So I don't see any pressure on interest rates at this point -- but I wouldn't make any forecasts.&quot;    Earlier this week, speculation was widespread that the Federal Reserve soon would tighten credit in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflation subdued. But Fed officials indicated Monday that they plan to await more evidence on the economy and inflation before making any credit-policy changes.    Some economists think evidence of stronger economic growth and higher inflation will emerge very soon, prompting the Fed to nudge interest rates higher. &quot;All the signs right now are pointing to somewhat higher interest rates,&quot; contended Norman Robertson, senior vice president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.    &quot;Business activity is turning out to be a good deal stronger than the markets had anticipated,&quot; Mr. Robertson added. &quot;There is concern about inflation, worries about a further drop in the value of the dollar, and a belief the Fed before long will again tighten policy another notch.&quot;    Whatever the case, several bond traders agreed that the Fed's intervention in the credit markets yesterday provided another hint that the central bank hasn't altered policy yet.    The Fed yesterday arranged $1.5 billion of repurchase agreements on behalf of a &quot;customer.&quot; (The Fed never divulges the identity of its customers, which usually are foreign central banks or international institutions.) The Fed maneuver, which temporarily injected funds into the banking system, came at a time when the interest rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, was 6 13/16%.    Fed officials, as usual, declined comment on the reason for the move. Some traders, though, quickly concluded that the maneuver was designed to keep the funds rate from rising any further and thus represented a signal to the markets that the Fed hasn't changed policy. They contend that the funds rate will continue hovering in a range between about 6 3/4% and 6 7/8%.    A few traders disagree. They contend that the Fed move was designed merely to offset temporary technical factors and didn't provide any clues to Fed policy objectives. Some predict the funds rate soon will rise to the 7% range, or possibly even 7 1/8%.    A clearer picture is likely to emerge tomorrow afternoon when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York provides its regular weekly report on banking and money-supply statistics.    Banks probably will raise their prime, or base, lending rates this spring or early this summer, according to Mellon Bank's Mr. Robertson. He predicted the prime rate, now 8 1/2%, will increase to at least 8 3/4% &quot;within a couple of months.&quot;    Although the federal funds rate yesterday averaged about the same as on Monday, most other short-term rates edged higher. For example, the rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills increased to 5.80% bid from an average 5.78% at Monday's auction by the government.    The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bills rose to 6.22% bid from an average 6.14%. But the rate on one-year bills declined to 6.58% bid from 6.63% bid Monday.    In the bond market, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds of 2017 rose to as high as 99 2/32 yesterday morning before retreating to wind up the day at 98 10/32, down from 98 1/2 Monday. The latest 10-year Treasury notes fell slightly to 95 3/8 from 95 1/2, while the yield increased to 8.84% from 8.82%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. fell 2.15 points to 1241.88. The high was 1251.40, and the low was 1240.88. </TEXT></DOC>
