The first group of chapters discuss the basic phenomenaand concepts of nuclear physics with emphasis on their relation to chemicalproblems, including the main properties and the composition of atomicnuclei, nuclear reactions, radioactive decay and interactions of radiationwith matter. These chapters provide the basis for understanding the followingchapters which encompass the wide scope of nuclear chemistry. The methodsof the investigation of chemical structure based on the interaction ofnuclear radiation with matter including positronium chemistry and otherexotic atoms is elaborated in particular detail. Separate chapters aredevoted to the use of radioactive tracers, the chemical consequencesof nuclear processes (i.e. hot atom chemistry), radiation chemistry,isotope effects and their applications, and the operation of nuclearreactors.</TEXT></DOC>
