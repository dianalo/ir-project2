Americans and Belgians share the memories of war and hard-wonpeace in this century.   Flanders, the battle of Ardennes, Bastogne _ those names arepart of our history as well as your own, part of our sharedheritage of freedom and the sacrifices it requires.   Belgium, no stranger to conquest and division, recognized fromthe first the importance of alliance in the postwar world, andtoday, as permanent home to NATO and the European community,Brussels stands at the center of a Europe free, at peace andprosperous as never before, a Europe that is steadily movingtowards a single market, and unprecedented political and economicopportunities.   In Brussels, the signs of this European renaissance areeverywhere. Belgium has been a good friend and a valued ally, onethat has always acted with alliance interests in mind. Early inthis decade, Belgium was one of five NATO nations that made thedifficult decision to base INF systems on its own soil. And thosedeployments gave us the leverage that we needed to negotiate thefirst ever nuclear arms reduction treaty, indeed one that banned anentire generation of nuclear weapons.   That's the kind of courageous and realistic approach thatexplains NATO's success. NATO is at once ready to ensure the commondefense, and to reduce arms, and seek to diminish tensions with theEast.   As I've said a number of times, we seek to move to a policybeyond containment. We want to see an end to the division of Europeand we want to see it ended on the basis of Western values. We willjoin Western European nations in encouraging the process of changein the Soviet Union, pointing to the day when the Soviet Union willbe welcomed as a constructive participant in the community of freenations.   I'm looking forward to important discussions with the King ofthe Belgians, King Baudouin, and the NATO heads of government. Ilook forward, as well, to my meeting with Prime Minister Martens,my friend, my discussions also with Mr. Delors of the EuropeanCommunity, and Secretary General Woerner at NATO.   The future of NATO depends on the alliance's ability to dealwith our enduring security concerns, and our evolving economicrelationship, We look to Belgium to continue to play its importantrole in our close, and cooperative transatlantic partnership. I amdelighted to be back, and thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for thiswarm welcome.</TEXT></DOC>
