Radioactivity measurementsby Japan Meteorological Agency are made at the land stations and at marineobservatories by ships. Collected samples are sent regularly to JMA'sMeteorological Research Institute for identification and measurementof specified species. The contents are the following: gross beta radioactivityin precipitation (sampling made every 24 hours), gross beta radioactivityin airborne dust (airborne dust collected once a week), monthly mean/sup 90/Sr concentration in airborne dust, gross beta radioactivity insea water (sea water collected twice a year - winter and summer), depositionof /sup 89/Sr, /sup 90/Sr and /sup 137/Cs (precipitation and dry falloutcollected), natural background radioactivity, vertical distribution ofradioactivity in free atmosphere.
