You even numbered Israel among the &quot;powers that could have prevented this sort of thing,&quot; totally ignoring the role Israel played in the massacre of Palestinians at two refugee camps in September 1982.    You neglected to mention the immensely destabilizing effect of the drawn-out Israeli occupation of south Lebanon. Even today, nearly five years after the 1982 invasion, Israeli forces and their proxies occupy a fairly large area along the Lebanese border under the pretext of guarding Israel's security.    Israel has not only refused to heed U.N. Security Council demands for withdrawal, it has prevented the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon from carrying out its mandate and, more important, has refused to permit the Lebanese National Army to play its role in the southern region, a role that could give the army the authority it also needs to act as a law-and-order force in the rest of Lebanon.
