The board said the Ryan Air Service flight crew failed toproperly oversee the loading of the craft and that so much of thecargo was loaded in the rear that the pilot lost control of theplane.   ``The real responsibility rested with the crew, which isresponsible for supervising the loading of the aircraft,'' saidJames L. Kolstad, acting chairman of the NTSB. ``For reasons I guesswe'll never know, they failed in that function.''   The twin-engine turboprop crashed on approach to Homer Airport inHomer, Alaska, on Nov. 23, 1987. Eighteen of the 21 people on boardwere killed.   Investigators had believed that ice on the aircraft might havecontributed to the accident, but the board said the ice ``did notcause but may have exacerbated the loss of control.''   The crash was Ryan Air's 10th in eight years, and the company hadbeen fined 10 months before the crash for record-keeping violations.While the board did not explicitly clear Ryan Air for any blame inthe accident, it adopted no conclusions that the commuter airlinewas at fault.   The staff report was adopted on a 4-1 vote, with board member JimBurnett voting no because he first wanted to see changes in wordingthat were agreed to in the board's meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
