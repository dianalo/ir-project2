The coup brought to power hard-liners identified asfriends of Fidel Castro's orthodox regime, but it alsoheightened the possibility that if the new regime fails toinstall order, Cuba's battered commercial relations with theSoviets could deteriorate further.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If the coup d'etat is consolidated, it will be a point inthe Cuban government's favor,&quot; said a European diplomat. Mr.Castro has long rejected Mr. Gorbachev's perestroika andholds fast to the slogan &quot;Socialism or Death.&quot;   Sergei Kutivov, correspondent for the Soviet news agencyTass, said his personal opinion is that the Cuban governmentwould see the changes in Moscow as favorable. &quot;The menreaching power are very good friends of Cuba,&quot; said Mr.Kutivov, &quot;especially the military, who have often said theywouldn't abandon Cuba. Until now, there had been doubts amongsome sectors in the Russian republic and the democraticforces in the country that it was worthwhile continuingrelations with Cuba.&quot;   But if civil wars break out in the Soviet Union, as oneSoviet official here predicts, the situation could beperilous for Cuba.   &quot;They will try to maintain commerce with Cuba -- at leastat present levels -- but no one knows how the situation willdevelop,&quot; said the official, who requested that his name notbe used. &quot;No one knows what action (Soviet) oil workers orthe miners will take.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
