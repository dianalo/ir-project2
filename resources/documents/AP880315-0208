Thomas Merrill Gaubert, 48, of DeSoto, Texas, was accused by afederal grand jury in Des Moines, Iowa, of arranging for theCapitol Savings and Loan Association of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, tounwittingly finance a ``land flip'' in Dallas County, Texas.   Gaubert bought some 44 acres of the Dallas County land at lessthan 50 cents per square foot, then sold it the same day through amiddleman to 22 buyers at $5.25 per square foot, the indictmentalleged.   He also was accused of denying involvement in the project andfailing to disclose to Sandamp;L regulators, as well as state and federalregulators, that during the transaction he was to be a buyer and aseller of the land.

In the fall of 1986, Wright, D-Texas, then House majorityleader, urged Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman Edwin Gray tomeet with Gaubert to hear his complaints about the board'streatment of Independent American.   At Wright's urging, Gray spent 2{ hours with Gaubert. Wrightsaid he was simply encouraging Gray to ensure that his agency wasbeing fair to one of Wright's constituents.   The Sandamp;L industry in Texas is focus of a massive federal criminalinvestigative effort that has resulted in a number of indictmentsof prominent businessmen.
