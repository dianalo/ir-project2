Bennett, president of American Rocket Co., watched on a videomonitor Thursday morning as his company's product _ billed as thenation's first commercially developed and built rocket _ went up inflames on the launch pad.   The failure of the launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base leftBennett and his 90-some employees with an emotional hurdle toovercome as they look to the next launch attempt. The Camarillo,Calif., company will wait six months to a year before trying asecond launch.   ``It's just a sick feeling. We worked so hard, and it meant somuch to us,'' Bennett said in a telephone interview. ``We worked along time to get this far and we hoped that it would be a success,that we can go on. At this point we can go on, but we don't havethat success.''   The attempted launch of the 58-foot-tall unmanned rocket was anespecially emotional moment for Amroc's employees because of theJuly death of company founder George Koopman in an automobileaccident. The rocket was nicknamed the ``Koopman Express.''   The rocket was to have soared on a $2 million, 15-minutesuborbital flight, conducting two experiments.   In a test of satellite sensors being developed for the Star Warsmissile defense system, the rocket was to release a cloud of inertgas. The idea was to see if the gas would shield the rocket fromdetection by sensors aboard the military's Delta Star satellite.   The rocket also was supposed to deploy a 390-pound test model ofan 8{-foot-wide ``ParaShield.'' Designed by Massachusetts Instituteof Technology students, it is a combined heat shield and parachutethat someday might be used in a new type of re-entry vehicle, suchas an escape system to allow space station astronauts to return toEarth.   Early indications were the launch failed because a liquid oxygenvalve opened only 20 percent to 30 percent, said GeorgeWhittinghill, Amroc marketing director. Not enough liquid oxygenfuel reached the engine to mix with solid fuel, so the thrust wasinadequate for liftoff.   For Bennett, the launch drama played itself out across videoscreens and electronic monitors in his post in the LaunchOperations Control Center on the base 140 miles northwest of LosAngeles.   Hopes ran high as the countdown concluded _ to the second _within the two-minute launch window. Another launch attempt onSept. 28 had to be scrapped because bad weather pushed Amroc pastthe launch window.   ``At first we were kind of elated because we made the countdownto the second, really an achievement on a first flight,'' Bennettsaid.   At 10:28 a.m., the engine ignited, but flames shot up the sidesof the rocket. Spectators shouted, ``It didn't take off! It didn'ttake off!'' Koopman's widow and sister started to cry.   As Bennett drove from the base to his hotel, he thought of howcompany founder Koopman would have reacted.   ``I knew George pretty well, and I know exactly what hisresponse would have been,'' said Bennett. ``He would have been upthere saying, `We're going to continue. We're going to succeed.'And that's what we're going to do.''</TEXT></DOC>
