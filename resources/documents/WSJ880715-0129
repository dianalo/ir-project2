Last month, he launched a grand jury investigation of Coke's business in the Soviet Union and whether it used bribes to get more of it. The grand jury has subpoenaed contracts and letters from Coke and its intermediary in selling to the Soviets: the London-based Satra Group. Such a move is typical of an investigation in its early stages. In an unusual twist, the grand jury is employing the Foreign Corruption Practices Act, an anti-bribery law that has been played down as anti-business in the Reagan years.    Taking on image-conscious Coca-Cola in its own backyard is audacious for Mr. Barr, a 39-year-old, little-known criminal lawyer turned federal prosecutor. That company aggressively markets and fiercely defends the all-American, apple-pie image that is an important part of its soft drink success. Moreover, investigating a large and prestigious corporate player &quot;isn't something a prosecutor does lightly,&quot; says Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers, a friend of Mr. Barr. The investigation has prompted bitter denials from Coca-Cola.    But then, in his 21 months in office, Mr. Barr has repeatedly proved he is daring, investigating such high-profile Atlanta politicians as Mayor Andrew Young. While Mayor Young was eventually exonerated, other investigations by Mr. Barr have led to indictments and convictions. &quot;We're not afraid to take these prosecutions wherever they lead,&quot; Mr. Barr says, declining to comment on the Coca-Cola investigation.    Mr. Barr is also ambitious. He wears attention-getting red suspenders, loves to give speeches and seems to enjoy all the local publicity he is getting. A Republican appointed by President Reagan at the behest of local party stalwarts, Mr. Barr says he might run for office after finishing as a federal prosecutor. But he says his high-profile investigations aren't politically motivated. In part, he says, he likes to &quot;send a message, for deterrent effect, to corporations and individuals.&quot;    Coca-Cola has reacted to the investigation defensively. When news of the inquiry first broke in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution last month, Coke termed allegations of wrongdoing so &quot;ridiculous&quot; that they didn't even warrant a denial. Then, when company President Donald R. Keough ended up in the embarrassing situation of having to address a seminar on East-West trade earlier this month with the investigation still hanging, he strongly denied any wrongdoing. Coke &quot;does not and will not pay bribes to Soviet officials or to anyone else,&quot; he said.    When an internal company investigation turned up no wrongdoing, Chairman Roberto C. Goizueta fired off a memo to all employees world-wide proclaiming Coca-Cola's innocence. The company has pressed Mr. Barr to conduct his own internal investigation of how the supposedly secret inquiry leaked out. &quot;We're lying prone here,&quot; says Carlton Curtis, Coke's spokesman, noting that Coca-Cola's expected exoneration won't make big headlines.    People who follow Coke doubt that Mr. Barr will turn up much. For one thing, they don't believe the company would have risked its reputation that way. Bribery &quot;just isn't the way Coke achieves their success,&quot; says an executive at a competitor. For another, any case could prove complex, since Coke sells to the Soviets through Satra, which also denies any wrongdoing.    Even if the investigation goes nowhere, it probably won't hurt Mr. Barr. While it may make him some powerful enemies, it also could bolster his reputation as a corruption fighter. &quot;Could this get him elected to Congress?&quot; Michael Lomax, an Atlanta political leader, asks rhetorically about the Coke case. &quot;Perhaps.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
