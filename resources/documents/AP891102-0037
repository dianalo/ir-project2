The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administrationaccused USX of permitting some of the violations at thePennsylvania plants even though the company agreed two years ago toeliminate them at all its facilities.   ``Company managers had known about many of these safety andhealth deficiencies at the plants for years, yet have failed totake necessary action to correct the hazards,'' said AssistantLabor Secretary Gerard F. Scannell, who heads OSHA.   USX has 15 working days to contest the citations and fines.   USX spokesman Thomas Ferrall said company officials would reviewthe citations before commenting on specifics but denied theyignored safety concerns.   ``There is no consideration more important than the health andsafety of our employees,'' Ferrall said in a telephone interview.``Our commitment to all of our people at all of our plants is toprovide a safe and healthy workplace. We think we are doing that.''   Ferrall said the company cooperated with OSHA and correctedsafety problems discovered during the investigation.   But Mike Wright, safety director for the United Steelworkers ofAmerica union, said only some of the problems had been corrected.   ``We're sorry that it came to this but we think that thecitations are well deserved,'' said Wright. ``The union has hadreal problems with both plants for some time. We've got safetyproblems at all their plants.''   The agency accused USX of 1,628 violations at its Fairless Hillssteel mill on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River nearTrenton, N.J. and proposed a fine of $6,095,600. That is thehighest fine OSHA has ever proposed for violations at one work site.   The company was accused of 376 violations at its Clairton CokeWorks near Pittsburgh. OSHA proposed a fine of $1,202,600 for those.   The alleged violations include failure to provide safe walkingand working surfaces; substandard crane-safety standards; failureto properly guard machines and power transmission equipment; noiseviolations; failure to keep accurate records of injuries andillnesses; structural flaws; and violations of electrical-safetystandards.   The citations stem from OSHA inspections that began in May atthe Clairton works, which has 1,500 workers, and in June atFairless Works, which employs 4,000. The Steelworkers filed acomplaint that triggered the Clairton inspection; employeecomplaints led to the other. OSHA said there have been three workerfatalities at the two plants in the last two years and 17 since1972.   The proposed fines total $7,298,200. The previous record was$5.1 million against companies involved in a building collapse atBridgeport, Conn. The largest for a single company was $4.3 millionagainst John Morrell Co. two years ago for alleged violations atmeat-packing plants. Both the Bridgeport and Morrell fines arebeing contested.   OSHA often accepts lesser amounts after negotiations with thecompanies involved.</TEXT></DOC>
