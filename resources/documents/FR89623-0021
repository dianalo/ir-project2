Statutory AuthoritySection 126(a) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986(SARA) requires the Secretary of Labor to promulgate, within one year afterthe date of enactment of SARA, health and safety standards pursuant tosection 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act),for employees engaged in hazardous waste operations. These section 126(a)standards were proposed by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safetyand Health Administration (OSHA) on August 10, 1987 (52 FR 29620) to replacethe existing interim final rule that had been published on December 19,1986 (51 FR 45654). Final regulations were published on March 6, 1989 (54FR 9294). Pursuant to section 126(c) of SARA, the OSHA worker protectionregulations are effective on March 6, 1990, one year after the date oftheir promulgation as a final rule. The OSHA final regulations containstandards for all private employees, and for Federal employees throughExecutive Order No. 12196. State and local employees in States that haveOSHA-approved plans under section 18 of the OSH Act must comply with standardsat least as stringent as the OSHA standards.Section 126(f) of SARA requires the Administrator of the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) to promulgate standards identical to those containedin the section 126(a) OSHA regulations (codified at 29 CFR 1910.120) nolater than 90 days after the date of promulgation of the OSHA final regulations.The EPA regulations are to cover State and local government employees inStates that are without an OSHA-approved State plan under section 18 ofthe OSH Act. Today's final rule implements the requirements of section126(f).B. Background of this RulemakingOn October 17, 1988, EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)(53 FR 40692) on Worker Protection Standards for Hazardous Waste Operationsand Emergency Response. In the NPRM, EPA requested that the public reviewthe proposed OSHA regulations of August 10, 1987 (52 FR 29620). In addition,EPA sought comment on two issues beyond the substance of the OSHA standards_thedefinition of ``employee'' and the effective date for final EPA regulations.EPA noted that within 90 days after the promulgation of OSHA's final regulations,EPA would promulgate identical standards.The official public comment period for the October 17, 1988 NPRM endedon November 16, 1988. EPA received a total of 17 comment letters, includingseven letters postmarked after the close of the official comment period.The comments received, together with the Agency's responses, are containedin the document ``Response to Comments on the October 17, 1988 Notice ofProposed Rulemaking on Worker Protection Standards,'' which is availablefor inspection in the Superfund Docket, Room M2427, U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 (Docket Number126WPS).Today, the Agency is promulgating the final rule on Worker Protection Standardsfor Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response. In preparing thefinal rule, EPA considered all of the public comments submitted on theOctober 17, 1988 NPRM. Section II of this preamble addresses the issuesand comments relating to the application of the OSHA standards by EPA.This final rule includes two different effective dates. The emergency responseportions of today's final rule are effective on March 6, 1990, the samedate as the OSHA rule. For other hazardous waste operations, EPA is retainingan effective date of 90 days from promulgation September 21, 1989. Thereasons for this two-part approach are explained in Section II.B. of thispreamble. EPA encourages all State and local governments who are able toapply these standards sooner than the applicable effective dates to doso.C. Organization of the Final RuleToday's final rule amends 40 CFR by adding Part 311_Worker Protection.Section 311.1 will extend the application of the OSHA standards to Stateand local employees in States without OSHA-approved plans. Section 311.2will provide the definition of the term ``employee'' applicable to andSection;311.1.The substantive provisions of 29 CFR 1910.120 will apply to State and localemployees engaged in ``hazardous waste operations,'' as defined in 29 CFR1910.120(a), in States that do not have a State plan approved under section18 of the OSH Act. Section 126 does not provide a definition of ``State''for purposes of determining the universe of entities to be regulated byEPA under subsection (f). Because EPA's standards under section 126(f)apply in ``each State which does not have in effect an approved State plan* * *,'' EPA believes it is appropriate in section 126(f) to use the OSHAdefinition of State. The OSH Act defines ``State'' to include the Statesof the U.S., the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands,American Samoa, Guam, and the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands.Thus, EPA's regulations use the term ``State'' to refer to these same entities,and EPA's final rule extends to any State that does not have an OSHA-approvedplan. An employee is defined in this final rule as a compensated or non-compensatedworker who is controlled directly by a State or local government, as contrastedto an independent contractor.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Worker Protection Standards for Hazardous Waste Operations andEmergency Response</ITAG>A. General RequirementsToday's final rule applies worker protection standards to certain Stateand local employees engaged in hazardous waste operations, pursuant tosection 126(f) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986(Pub. L. 99-499) (SARA). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) has promulgated standards that apply to all private employees, andto all Federal employees through Executive Order No. 12196. States thatoperate under an OSHA-approved plan are required to adopt standards atleast as stringent as the OSHA standards to protect its State and localemployees. Today's rule will apply the OSHA standards to employees of Stateswithout approved plans under section 18(b) of the Occupational Safety andHealth Act of 1970 (OSH Act). Employees covered by these standards willinclude non-compensated workers as well as compensated workers. The followingStates currently do not have OSHA-approved State plans and, therefore,are subject to today's final rule \1\<NOTE/>:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The specific States covered by today's final rule mayvary over time, depending upon whether a State has in place an OSHA-approvedState plan.

Clarification of Key Issues in the Rulemaking<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Definition of ``Employee'' of State and local Governments</ITAG>In the October 17, 1988 NPRM, EPA proposed to allow individual States todevelop their own definition of the term ``employee'', so long as the definitionwas consistent with other State statutes or regulations. This approachwould have been consistent with the approach taken by OSHA. Due to limitationsin the OSH Act, individual OSHA-plan States are allowed to establish theirown definition of the term employee and as a result, some States includevolunteers and some do not. The definition of employee is important becausewhether that term is defined narrowly or broadly determines whether non-compensatedworkers, such as volunteer fire fighters, first responders, and emergencymedical technicians responding to emergency incidents, are protected bythe EPA standards.Fourteen commenters on the NPRM addressed the issue of the definition ofemployee; eleven of them supported the inclusion of volunteers within thedefinition and three had concerns about such a broad definition. Thosesupporting the inclusion of volunteers cited several reasons for theirposition, particularly noting that all responders deserved the same levelof protection and that Congress' intent to protect the health and safetyof workers would be achieved only through a broad definition of the termemployee that included both paid and unpaid workers. In fact, one commenterindicated that allowing States to define employee under section 126(f)would be contrary to Congressional intent. Another commenter noted thattraining in safe work procedures enhances the safety and efficiency ofthe cleanup itself. The three commenters holding the view that volunteersshould not be included in the definition of employee believed that suchan approach would put a strain on available resources or that the costsexceeded the benefits (particularly when supervisory personnel are likelyto be trained and volunteers may not routinely be in immediate contactwith hazardous materials), as taxes would need to be raised or currentfunding priorities revised in order to meet health and safety trainingand equipment needs for the additional employees covered by a broad definition.Under today's final rule, EPA has defined the term ``employee'' of Stateand local governments to include both compensated and non-compensated workers.This definition has no applicability beyond this regulation and does notaffect the definition of employee used for other purposes. The Agency agreeswith the majority of commenters that this broad definition of ``employee''is appropriate because whether or not wages are paid is an insufficientbasis for failing to require standards of protection for individuals whocan be exposed to hazardous situations in the course of performing emergencyresponse duties. Under today's final rule, employees in non-OSHA plan Stateswill be allowed to participate in response activities only if such employeesreceived proper training and are in compliance with the other worker protectionstandards imposed in this rulemaking. Not to include volunteers in thedefinition of employee would leave these responders subject to greaterhealth and safety risks. In States that are without an OSHA-approved plan,approximately eighty percent of the fire fighters (about 500,000) are volunteers.This approach is consistent with the requirement of SARA section 126(f)to promulgate standards identical to those promulgated by OSHA. The definitionof employee deals with the scope of coverage of those standards and notthe substance of the standards themselves. Further, this approach is fullyconsistent with Congress' intent in passing section 126(f). As discussedby OSHA (see 54 FR 9297-9298, 9312; March 6, 1989), Congress used broadlanguage to express its intent to provide broad coverage for all emergencyresponse situations, not just for a limited class of hazardous waste operations.This broad coverage was supported by the fact that Congress made section126 a free-standing provision and did not amend the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. andSection;9601 <T3>et seq</T3>., nor the OSH Act.Further, in section 126(d)(4), Congress directed OSHA to provide trainingstandards for ``workers who are responsible for responding to hazardousemergency situations who may be exposed to toxic substances in carryingout their responsibilities.'' This language is also broad, and volunteerswho take on emergency responsibilities at the direction of a State or localityclearly ``may be exposed'' by carrying out such responsibilities.Finally, the legislative history of section 126 indicates that Congressintended broad coverage for all persons conducting emergency response.For example, Senator Metzenbaum specifically addressed his concern forproviding training to ``fire fighters who are called in to deal with toxicexplosions * * *'' 131 Cong. Rec. S11996 (Sept. 24, 1985). EPA's interpretationwould apply regulatory standards to all State or local fire fighters engagedin emergency response in relevant jurisdictions; a narrow interpretationwould exclude eighty percent of these fire fighters.In requiring worker protection standards, Congress thus intended to minimizehealth and safety risks for responders in hazardous waste cleanup activities.A reasonable interpretation of Congress' intent is that training, medicalsurveillance, maximum exposure limits, and other worker protection standardsshould apply to <T3>all</T3> persons whose duties bring them into contact with hazardouswastes during site cleanup and emergency response, whether or not theyreceive monetary compensation for the activity. Inclusion of noncompensatedemployees in this regulation also is consistent with recently proposedrevisions to the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution ContingencyPlan (the NCP) that require compliance with OSHA standards for volunteersin cleanups undertaken pursuant to the NCP (40 CFR 300.185, 53 FR 51493,December 21, 1988).OSHA itself has not taken this approach because of the long standing limitationin the OSH Act (enacted in 1970) on OSHA regulation of employees of Stateand local government. EPA is not subject to that limitation as section126(f) is free-standing, and was created by Congress' removing languagefrom section 126(a), which remained under OSHA control. Moreover, OSHAacknowledges that volunteers are an important component of the emergencyresponse network and supports use of a broad interpretation by EPA, aswell as application of these standards to volunteers by States with OSHA-approvedplans that do not generally apply to volunteers.EPA acknowledges that the expanded definition of ``employee'' may imposeadditional costs on State and local governments in States without OSHA-approvedplans. However, grants are available to universities and other nonprofitorganizations for developing and administering tuition-free health andsafety training for workers engaged in hazardous waste operations, whichcould offset some portion of these increased costs. Among the sources forgrants are the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)and, through September 1989, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).In addition, EPA has developed tuition-free training courses availableto State and local government employees, and training materials that areavailable free of charge to State and local governments. Organizationsinterested in further information about EPA training courses and materialsshould contact the Operational Support Section of the Environmental ResponseTeam, U.S. EPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268,(513) 569-7537.EPA believes that there are significant benefits to including volunteerswithin the scope of today's rule. These benefits accrue both to the communitiesthat could be endangered by inadequately trained responders and to theresponders themselves. EPA believes these factors outweigh any additionalcosts that may be incurred in complying with today's final rule, and thatadoption of the broad definition is reasonable.Five commenters requested that EPA develop a national definition of employeethat includes non-compensated workers and that would be applied in allStates, whether or not they have OSHA-approved State plans. They statedthat inclusion of volunteers in the definition of employee would facilitateinterstate commerce, because of the steady stream of interstate hazardouswaste transport, and would minimize risks to the communities. The commentersfurther stated that standardization would ensure safe response actionsby all State and local governments to incidents requiring mutual aid operations.EPA has not complied with the commenters' request because EPA has no authorityto establish a national definition of ``employee''. Section 126(f) of SARArequires EPA to promulgate identical standards to those promulgated byOSHA (codified at 29 CFR 1910.120) that apply to State and local employeesin States without an OSHA-approved State plan. EPA lacks authority to extendthe regulation to volunteers in States with OSHA-approved plans.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Effective Date of Final Rule</ITAG>EPA requested comments in the NPRM on the appropriate effective date ofits final rule. EPA proposed 90 days as sufficient time for preparing forcompliance. Nine commenters addressed the effective date issue. Of thenine, seven commenters stated that more than 90 days was needed for compliance,one supported EPA's 90-day proposal, and one believed the rule should beeffective immediately. Several commenters suggested use of a sequencedcompliance schedule or a timetable for compliance.EPA has decided to adopt different effective dates for two separate groupsof employees affected by this final rule. The effective date for emergencyresponders is March 6, 1990; the effective date for all other employeesengaged in hazardous waste operations is 90 days after the date of promulgationof this rule. EPA acknowledges that, in the case of emergency responders,a full understanding of the new requirements was not possible until OSHApromulgated its final standards pursuant to section 126(a) of SARA, anda full understanding of the scope (i.e., the broader definition of employee)was not possible until EPA promulgated this final rule. In addition, thelarger number of emergency responders subject to the EPA regulations maylead to scheduling complications for training and other provisions of therule. Thus, 90 days might not provide sufficient time for some State andlocal governments to apply the standards to all employees in an orderlyfashion. Therefore, EPA is making the emergency response portions of today'sfinal rule effective on March 6, 1990, the same date as the OSHA rule.EPA believes that this effective date is reasonable. EPA encourages allState and local governments to comply sooner, if possible.For other hazardous waste operations, including those conducted at treatment,storage, and disposal facilities, EPA is retaining an effective date of90 days from promulgation, September 21, 1989. At these sites, privateemployers have had to comply with essentially the same OSHA standards sincethe date of OSHA's interim final rule (December 19, 1986). State and localgovernments are often involved in a coordinated response with private employeesat these sites, and EPA wants to minimize the time in which State and localemployees do not receive the protection of this rule. EPA believes thattraining courses for hazardous waste operations other than emergency response,which fully reflect the standards in 29 CFR 1910.120, can be used by Statesand localities to provide an orderly transition for the subject employees.EPA believes, therefore, that it is important and possible for State andlocal governments to apply these standards in an orderly fashion soonerthan in the case of emergency responders. Thus, EPA believes that thiseffective date is reasonable.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Supporting Analysis</ITAG>A. Executive Order No. 12291Executive Order (E.O.) No. 12291 requires that regulations be classifiedas major or non-major for purposes of review by the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB). According to E.O. No. 12291, major rules are regulationsthat are likely to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.EPA has determined that today's final rule is non-major. The Agency estimatesthat the annual costs of compliance with EPA's application of OSHA's workerprotection standards to State and local employees in non-OSHA States isapproximately $38 million. The benefits attributable to EPA's applicationof OSHA's worker protection standards include chronic illnesses and deathsavoided, acute injuries and fatalities avoided, medical costs avoided andwork days saved, and greater protection of community properties and lives.Many of these benefits are difficult to quantify. EPA estimates, however,that over five lives will be saved annually and about $12 million in medicalcosts and lost productivity will be avoided annually when today's finalrule is implemented. For further information on EPA's benefits estimatessee ``Benefits Attributable to EPA's Worker Protection Standards,'' availablein the Superfund Docket at EPA.The EPA cost and benefit estimates are based on an analysis conducted byOSHA of the economic effects in all 50 States of the SARA section 126 workerprotection standards.\2\<NOTE/> The OSHA economic analysis includes cost estimates for applyingthe standards to both compensated and non-compensated employees. EPA'sanalysis attributes some of the costs and benefits contained in the OSHAeconomic report to EPA's worker protection regulations. The EPA costs andbenefits, therefore, are a subset of the OSHA estimates.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ See U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety andHealth Administration. ``Regulatory Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysisof the Occupational Safety and Health Standards for Hazardous Waste Operationsand Emergency Response,'' December 14, 1988. (OSHA Economic Document)In general, the costs attributable to the EPA regulations are incurredby employers of two categories of workers in non-OSHA States: (1) Publicemergency response teams (e.g., police and fire fighters); and (2) publicemployees, including On-Scene Coordinators, engaged in cleanups of hazardouswaste at uncontrolled sites and at treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.The estimated net annual costs attributable to these two categories ofemployees are $36.6 million and $1.6 million, respectively.Thus, the total estimated annual cost is about $38 million. For furtherdetails, see ``Compliance Cost Analysis in Support of EPA Worker ProtectionStandards Under Section 126(f) of the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct of 1986'' (Cost Analysis). This rule has been submitted to the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) for review as required by E.O. No. 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires that a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis be performed for all rules that are likely to have a ``significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities.'' In OSHA's RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis for its worker protection standards, OSHA determinedthat the standards may have some impact on local subcontractors performinghazardous waste operations. The EPA regulations do not affect these workersbecause they are private employees. There is a possibility, however, thatsome small municipalities in non-OSHA States may be unable to afford thecosts of compliance with the worker protection standards. These small communitieshave the option of pooling resources with neighboring communities to forma regional response capability. In addition, through tuition-free trainingcourses and the extension of the effective date for emergency responders,EPA believes that the costs to small municipalities have been minimizedand should not present a significant burden. Such municipalities also havethe option of not acting as first responders to hazardous materials incidents,in which case they should coordinate with the Local Emergency PlanningCommittees and the State Emergency Response Commission to ensure properhazardous materials incidents response within their municipalities.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Under section 301 of Title III of SARA (also known asthe Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA)),States have established State Emergency Response Commissions (SERCs), whichin turn have appointed Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs), forthe purpose of establishing a framework for State and local emergency planning.On the basis of the analysis contained in the Cost Analysis supportingthis rulemaking and in the OSHA Economic Document, I hereby certify thatthis rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThe information collection requirements in this final rule have been submittedfor approval to OMB under the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</T3>, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq</T3>. These requirements are not effective until OMB approvesthem and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 3.7 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burdento Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 726 Jackson PlaceNW., Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 311</ITAG>Containers, Drums, Emergency response, Hazardous materials, Hazardous substances,Hazardous waste, Materials handling and storage, Personal protection equipment,Storage areas, Training, Waste disposal.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
