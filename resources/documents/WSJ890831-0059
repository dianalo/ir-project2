Setting an upbeat mood for the event, two local chicken houses gave away dinners as door prizes while disk jockeys from a nearby Akron station played records and cheered the six-year-old program to collect newspapers, glass bottles and aluminum cans.    Today Mr. Harrison feels less festive. The city official is trying to unload $250,000 of used recycling equipment. Barberton's recycling program, which used to contribute $3,000 to $5,000 a year to the Little League and other community projects, is dead.    Success killed recycling in Barberton, just as it threatens community recycling programs across the U.S.    It's no secret America is having trouble grappling with the garbage crisis. Despite overflowing landfills, many U.S. cities and states refuse to grant permits for new dumps or incinerators, citing health and property-value concerns. But in their rush to mandate the only other option -- recycling -- politicians have failed to stimulate demand for recycled goods.    &quot;We told {elected officials} they were going to have a problem, but they didn't listen,&quot; says a frustrated John Rafferty, director of the solid-waste division of greater Minneapolis's Metropolitan Council.    The markets for recycled aluminum and glass have held up, because reusing those materials is still cheaper than starting afresh. And the plastics industry, afraid of being legislated out of business, is financing its own search for uses of recycled plastic. But the market for old newspapers, the key commodity in any recycling program because it accounts for roughly 60% of revenue, has collapsed this year under tremendous oversupply.    Fifteen months ago, Mr. Harrison got $30 a ton for old newspapers. Just before he shut his doors July 28, he paid a broker $10 a ton to haul papers away. The newspaper glut will cost communities more than $100 million in lost revenue this year, and the longer range implications are more worrisome. Even if newsprint makers stick to their promises of recycling more paper, it could be two or three years before they are equipped to do so. And then, production will still hinge on publishers' demand, which has been weak. The need for old newspapers, therefore, isn't likely to increase anytime soon.    &quot;The future scares me,&quot; says Kevin Preblud, vice president of U.S. Recycling Industries Inc. in Denver. As people witness the higher costs of recycling, he worries they will lose interest in programs they once thought would be cheap, or even free, to operate.    &quot;Recycling is entering a very dangerous period,&quot; says Jerry Powell, editor of Resource Recycling, a trade publication in Portland, Ore. &quot;A lot of governments are going to have trouble riding out the slump.&quot;    With more communities discontinuing paper pickup in face of the glut, &quot;paper is going back into the trash,&quot; says Margaret Fleming, a Baltimore paper broker. (Contrary to popular belief, newspapers take decades to decompose in landfills.) And without workable recycling, communities with overflowing landfills must build unpopular, expensive disposal plants or face big recurring costs to ship garbage ever-longer distances.    Many politicians are trying to salvage newspaper recycling, and in the process are putting publishers on the spot, trying to force them to use more recycled fiber. Connecticut recently passed legislation requiring a publisher that prints in Connecticut, or that sells more than 40,000 copies of a newspaper in that state, to use 40% recycled fiber in at least 20% of the newspaper's sheets. The law takes effect in 1993 and, by 1997, 90% of all sheets will have to meet the 40% quota.    The 1,385-member American Newspaper Publishers Association is threatening to sue, arguing that such a regulated market erodes the &quot;traditional distance between publishers and governments,&quot; according to Tonda Rush, an attorney for the association.    Ms. Rush acknowledges that publishers have had a longstanding bias against recycled newsprint, claiming inferior quality. In addition, recycled newsprint, costing about the same as new paper, has no price advantage. Ms. Rush says the bias is eroding as technology improves, but legislators appear impatient. California and Wisconsin are expected shortly to follow Connecticut's example. There's even talk in some state capitals about requiring a deposit on each newspaper, or requiring newspaper and even magazine publishers to collect their old publications.    Feeling pressured, several paper manufacturers in the past two months have announced plans to increase capacity for processing recycled paper. However, the paper makers say it will take three years to gear up fully.    Meanwhile, &quot;I'm afraid we're going to lose the grass-roots momentum for recycling, all the Boy Scout troops and church groups,&quot; says U.S. Recycling Industries' Mr. Preblud. In New York, Rod Edwards of the American Paper Institute wonders whether cash-strapped municipalities will restart their recycling programs after the slump is over, given that recycling newspapers may still cost more than sending them to landfills. While landfills are less of an option in the jam-packed Eastern states, there is still space in the Midwest, though it is getting more expensive.    For companies like Waste Management Inc. in Chicago and Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. in Houston, the woes of community recycling programs represent a business opportunity. That's why they've added recycling to their list of disposal services they offer communities. But for communities, the professional help adds huge cost. Under some Browning-Ferris contracts, municipalities even must share the company's financial risk when prices for recyclable commodities decline.    Some towns are adding to their problems through poor collection habits. James Burke, executive vice president of Garden State Paper Co., a major recycler of newsprint, says some towns allow phone books and junk mail to get thrown into the mix, and permit bundles to be tied with such contaminants as panty hose.    So far, the slide in price for old newspaper has taken its highest toll on Midwestern recycling programs because of the region's higher transportation costs to paper mills and ports.    Last month, Dane County, Wis., commissioners partially lifted a ban on landfilling old newspapers after the county's paper broker halved the amount of old newspapers he was willing to buy each month. The temporary waiver was opposed by many civic leaders who believe residents will get out of the recycling habit.    Youngstown, Ohio, quit picking up newspapers a month ago. William Dundee, the city's litter-control coordinator, says residents were advised to store old papers, but may soon be told to just throw them out. The city still collects glass and aluminum, but Mr. Dundee says he's concerned that before long, &quot;People are going to say 'I'm wasting my time recycling.'&quot;    Roger S. Angell, a Washington, D.C., consultant to Browning-Ferris, agrees with environmentalists that the recycling movement in America could be seriously undermined as people get disillusioned by the failure of community programs.    In Minneapolis, &quot;recycling is becoming less popular,&quot; says Mr. Rafferty, the city official, because residents heard that their newspapers were going to a landfill anyway because of the paper market's collapse. That practice has stopped, Mr. Rafferty says. However, in June the companies that collect the recyclable goods forced area governments to renegotiate contracts. As a result, garbage fees rose roughly 20%, and now the cost of recycling approximates the cost of landfilling.    &quot;Recycling has been billed as easy to do and free,&quot; Mr. Rafferty says. &quot;But it is neither.&quot;    ---@ The Trash Piles Up @ One household's generation of recoverables per month, in pounds @ Newspapers 28 @ Glass containers 17.3 @ Tin cans 6.8 @ Aluminum cans 1.9 @ Plastic &quot;Pet&quot;* 0.6 @ *Clear plastic soft drink bottles @ Source: Browning-Ferris Industries </TEXT></DOC>
