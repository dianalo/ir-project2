John Baldwin, director of the Utah Division of Securities andpresident of the North American Securities AdministratorsAssociation, told a news conference announcing the formation of thealliance that ``Americans lose $1 million an hour to investmentfraud promoted over the telephone.''   Such an amount is equivalent to $8.8 billion a year. This wouldbe about a fifth of Baldwin's estimate of all fraud losses by smallinvestors.   Many members of the new organization are involved with selling bytelephone, and one of them said con artists are giving legitimatebusinesses a bad name.   Richard Barton, senior vice president of the Direct MarketingAssocaition, said that ``fraudulent telemarketers reach consumersnot only on the telephone, but also through the mail andadvertisement.''   Ms. Golodner said the new group believes the most common scams bytelephone salespeople are prize offers to lure buyers of waterpurifiers and vitamins, so-called ``penny'' stocks, office supplies,magazine subscriptions, credit repair, precious metals, travelarrangements, art, business ventures and cellular telephone lotteryapplications.</TEXT></DOC>
