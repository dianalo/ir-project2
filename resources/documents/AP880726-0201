That brought the confirmed death toll in Saturday's disaster to19. Eleven people from the Fujimaru were missing and presumed deadand 18 were rescued.   Coast guard ships brought families of the victims to within afew yards of where a giant crane pulled up the 154-ton charterfishing boat. The operation was broadcast live on nationaltelevision.   Authorities were to continue the search for bodies Wednesday.   News reports meanwhile suggested the captain of the MaritimeSelf-Defense Force submarine Nadashio may have erred just beforethe collision in Tokyo Bay.   The 2,200-ton submarine Nadashio collided head-on with theFujimaru while the naval vessel crossed a busy shipping lane nearthe entrance of Tokyo Bay.   Kyodo News Service, NHK Radio and television reports quoted theship's surviving crew as saying the Nadashio sounded its horn towarn the vessel out of its path, instead of turning to avoid acollision.   The Fujimaru sank within two minutes. The submarine reported noinjuries among its 75 crew.   ``As captain of the ship, I did my best ... to avoid acollision,'' Manji Kondo, the 30-year-old captain of the Fujimaru,told a televised news conference Tuesday night.   ``It happened too fast for us to try to rescue passengers leftinside. For a captain of a ship it is the greatest blow to theheart.''   The disaster prompted speculation among Japan's press thatDefense Agency chief Tsutomu Kawara would resign to takeresponsibility.   But at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita charged Kawara with concluding the salvage operation andaccounting for all the victims.   Kawara and other defense officials faced criticism fromsurvivors, relatives of victims and news commentators about theNadashio's 21-minute delay in notifying the coast guard of theaccident.   People thrown from the ship sank out of sight as crewmen atopthe submarine watched, reports said. One survivor told journalistscrewmen stared back as she waved and yelled at them, ``Why won'tyou help?''   Of the 19 people plucked from the water, 16 were rescued by apassing yacht and a tanker and only three by the submarine. One ofthose rescued later died.</TEXT></DOC>
