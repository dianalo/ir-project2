But Abdullah Luthufi, in a television interview, said he was notentirely responsible for Thursday's aborted attack by an estimated150 Sri Lankan mercenaries in the Maldivian capital of Male, thetelevision said.   Officials said 14 people were killed and 40 wounded in fighting.Luthufi and some mercenaries fled Maldives Friday with 27 hostagesaboard a cargo ship, but surrendered two days later to the Indiannavy.   Doordarshan, India's government-owned television, interviewedLuthufi aboard the Indian frigate Godavari after his capture.   Maldivian Foreign Minister Fathulla Jameel said Luthufi, once anaide to former President Ibrahim Nasir, conducted operations anddirected mercenaries during the coup attempt.   Luthufi, a businessman, told the television he was not entirelyresponsible for the decisions, but ``given this opportunity,'' hebecame politically ambitious. He did not elaborate on who else wasresponsible.   Nasir, whose followers have staged failed coups in 1980 and 1983,has denied involvement.   Luthufi was among 46 people on board the cargo ship ``ProgressLight'' who surrendered to Indian commandos. The ship, crippled byIndian fire, sank in the Indian Ocean on Monday, officials said.   When it sank, there were no passengers on board the ship, ArunBanerjee, India's High Commissioner said. His rank is equivalent tothat of an Ambassador.   At least four hostages aboard the ship died and 15 were injuredbefore the surrender, the television said. Indian officials wouldnot say how the hostages were killed and injured.   Maldivian Transport Minister Ahmad Mujuthaba was among theinjured hostages removed to a hospital in the southern Indian portcity of Trivandrum.   In Male, Maldivian authorities detained more than 100 suspectedsympathizers of the coup attempt.   ``Searches are being carried out for those suspected to have beenleft behind by the mercenaries,'' President Maumoon Abdul Gayoomsaid.   Maldivian and Indian officials say most of the 150-membermercenary force escaped by sea. Indian naval ships have beensearching the area.   The president had requested Indian assistance to quell the coupin his 2,000-island nation. He has vowed to try the mercenaries.   Gayoom, 50, was elected president in 1978 after Nasir resignedand fled to Singapore. Nasir, 62, has been accused ofmisappropriating $4.2 million in state funds during his 10-year rule.   Gayoom is scheduled to begin a third term Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
