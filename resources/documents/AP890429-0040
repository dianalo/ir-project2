State Council spokesman Yuan Mu and State Education Minister HeDongchang met for 3{ hours with both student activists andrepresentatives of officially sanctioned student unions.   It was the first government contact with the student activists.The government has declared their organizations illegal.   The appearance of Yuan, believed to be part of the inner circleof the nation's top decision-makers, was an indication of howserious the government regards the recent student unrest.   The Chinese government criticized a U.S. statement on the recentdemonstrations, calling it inappropriate because the demonstrationsare ``purely China's internal affair.'' In Washington, the StateDepartment had said that all peoples should have the right ofpeaceful assembly, ``including peaceful protest and freedom ofexpression.''   The meeting took place in offices of the All-China YouthFederation, a government body encompassing various youth groups.   Wu'er Kaixi, the president of the United Association of BeijingUniversities, a group newly formed by student activists, wasinvited to the meeting but not allowed to attend after he refusedto give up a plan to openly denounce the government's position thatthe association is illegal.   Zhou Yongjun, another representative of the independent studentgroup who attended the meeting, said it was a failure because thegovernment side refused to recognize the legitimacy of theassociation.   He said State Education Minister repeated the governmentargument that the association was illegal, but ``he couldn't saywhich law we've broken. That to me was a victory.''   After the protests began, students at 41 Beijing colleges oustedtheir school-appointed student federations and set up their ownstudent committees. Each of the committees in turn choserepresentatives to the United Association of Beijing Universities.   Zhou said the weeklong class boycott in force in most Beijinguniversities would continue. The students are demanding freedoms ofpress and speech and an end to official corruption.   Zhou said the student side raised questions of bureaucracy andcorruption in the meeting. He said Yuan sought to placate thestudents by saying that a shrill editorial in the Communist Partymouthpiece People's Daily last week was directed at only a minorityof the students.   The editorial accused the students of being unpatriotic and saidthey were involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the Communist Partyand the government.   Students reacted to the editorial by staging a 15-hour marchthrough the streets of Beijing on Thursday. Up to 150,000 marcherswere cheered on by tens of thousands of citizens along the way inone of the boldest challenges ever to the Communist Partyleadership.   Zhou complained that the government side did not treat thestudent leaders as equals. He said there were no plans for furthermeetings with the government.   Of the 40 students at the meeting, about half were from thenewly formed student-chosen activist groups and the other half fromthe official student unions which the activists have rejected.   One activist leader said many from the official student unionssupported their cause.   The campuses were quiet today, with classrooms empty and manystudents outside enjoying the spring weather.   At Beijing Normal University scattered groups of students saidin one classroom building quietly studying, but no classes were insession.   Student leaders have said the strike will go on until Thursday,the 70th anniversary of China's first student demonstrations fordemocracy.</TEXT></DOC>
