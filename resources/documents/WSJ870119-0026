Although the dollar's recent weakness caught forecasters off guard, these analysts say the currency turmoil only will delay the move toward lower interest rates. They predict business activity will slow sharply this quarter, leaving the Federal Reserve System with little choice but to ease credit conditions further.    The Fed will reduce its discount rate to 5% by late March, many analysts contend. The discount rate, now 5 1/2%, is the fee the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    &quot;I still think we'll see a further decline in short-term interest rates, although not as immediately as I would have expected&quot; just a few weeks ago, said Kathleen Cooper, senior vice president and chief economist at Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles. The economy is &quot;far from robust,&quot; she said, adding that a discount rate cut is likely late this quarter or early in the second quarter.    The Commerce Department is scheduled to release Thursday its preliminary estimate of the economy's growth in last year's fourth quarter. Analysts generally estimate that the report will show the gross national product expanded at an annual rate of between 2.5% and 3%, after adjusting for inflation. That would be little changed from the third quarter's 2.8% pace.    But economists say the fourth-quarter figure may be misleading, bloated by a wave of spending stemming from the new tax law that went into effect Jan. 1. They say much of the economy's strength in the final three months of 1986 may have been borrowed from this quarter.    &quot;The fourth-quarter numbers should be taken with a grain of salt,&quot; said Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago. He said it's questionable whether the momentum developed late last year can be sustained. Mr. Kahan predicts sluggish growth this quarter, with GNP increasing at only about a 1% annual rate.    A. Gilbert Heebner, executive vice president and economist at CoreStates Financial Corp. in Philadelphia, says 1987 will be a &quot;sluggish year.&quot; He sees a first-quarter growth rate of between 1.5% and 2%. That, he said, would be slow enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to lower the discount rate to 5% by late March. He also predicted that the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, now almost 7 3/8%, will decline to about 7% by the end of this quarter.    The dollar will remain weak &quot;throughout most of the year,&quot; Mr. Heebner contended. But Fed officials will focus their attention more on economic conditions than on the dollar's performance, he argued.    The dollar's unexpected plunge last week jarred the credit markets. Bond traders feared that foreign investors, who have amassed huge amounts of U.S. Treasury bonds in recent years, might shy away from buying more U.S. securities because of the dollar's precipitous decline. Moreover, many expressed concern that the drop in the dollar will lead to higher inflation, the archenemy of fixed-income securities.    &quot;There are definite inflation risks&quot; in the dollar's steep slide, said Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International. As a result, the Fed won't lower its discount rate &quot;anytime soon,&quot; he predicted. He also contended that the economy will accelerate this quarter, growing at about a 3.5% annual rate. He expects interest rates to rise, with the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds soaring to 8 1/2% by midyear. &quot;Bonds offer more risks than rewards right now,&quot; he said.    Roger E. Brinner, chief economist of Data Resources, agrees that inflation will pick up this year. But he argues that the economy will be so weak early this year that the Fed will feel obligated to lower its discount rate by March. He also expects the banking industry to lower its prime, or base, rate on corporate loans to 7% late in March from the current level of 7 1/2%.    &quot;However, I expect the rate declines to be short-lived,&quot; Mr. Brinner said. The prime rate will return to 7 1/2% in the third quarter as economic growth resumes and inflation averages about 4%, he contended.    There is &quot;better than a 50-50 chance&quot; of a discount rate cut this quarter, said W. Lee Hoskins, senior vice president and chief economist of PNC Financial Corp. Unlike many other forecasters, though, Mr. Hoskins expects a reduction of only a quarter of a percentage point to 5 1/4%.    Nonetheless, Mr. Hoskins contends that long-term bond yields won't decline much further. &quot;We don't see much of a play in bonds,&quot; he said, adding that investors still are &quot;concerned about inflation.&quot; He predicts that the consumer price index will rise at an annual rate of around 5% late this year.    In the credit markets Friday, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 rose to a price of 102 from 101 14/32 Thursday. That lowered the yield to 7.33% from 7.38%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 increased to 101 19/32 from 101 11/32, trimming the yield to 7.02% from 7.06%.    Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills edged lower. The rate on the Treasury's latest 13-week bill declined to 5.34% bid from 5.36% Thursday. The bid on the latest 26-week issue fell to 5.38% from 5.4%. </TEXT></DOC>
