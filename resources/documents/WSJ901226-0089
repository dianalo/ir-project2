Taking advantage of the stock market's recent rebound,corporate executives, directors and major holders have begunlightening their holdings of their own companies' shares,filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.That's in sharp contrast to the insider-buying spurt thatcame right after Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait Aug. 2.</LP><TEXT>   Until recently, insider buying had been outpacing insiderselling by a 2-1 margin. But that's changing. Buying is stillrunning ahead of selling for now, but SEC filings forNovember show the margin is narrowing.   &quot;A lot of insiders at good companies were selling into theNovember rally,&quot; said Bob Gabele, head of Invest/Net, a FortLauderdale, Fla., concern that tracks SEC filings. In fact,he said, &quot;they began unloading at the first bounce from theAugust and September lows.&quot;   Insider selling has picked up particularly in the healthcare, oil, real estate and construction industries,Invest/Net data indicate.   The selling may be related in part to tax-law changes thatwill mean steeper levies next year for some high-incomeexecutives.   But in general, insiders buy and sell shares based on howthe company is faring and &quot;in reaction to the level of thestock market,&quot; said Donald Baxter, chairman of BaxterFinancial Corp., a Boca Raton, Fla., investment firm. Therecent selling may be related to the fact that &quot;people areseeing a deterioration of the economy affecting theirbusinesses,&quot; yet shares are trading at higher prices than atany time since the invasion.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit what appears to havebeen its low for the year at 2365.10 in mid-October. Sincethen, it has rebounded more than 250 points to close Mondayat 2621.29.   &quot;Insiders were buying when the market was down and youcouldn't give stocks away,&quot; said Michael Murphy, editor ofthe Overpriced Stock Service newsletter. Many of themprofited as the market firmed in November. Now, he said, theinsiders may be leading the pack in selling.   Mr. Gabele of Invest/Net cautions that evidence from SECfilings is preliminary. But &quot;investors might think theremight be some downside momentum in the market coming,&quot; hesaid.   These are some of the companies that experienced clustersof insider selling recently:   -- At Boston-based Gillette Co., five insiders sold atotal of 33,000 shares in late October and November, SECfilings show. They sold at prices ranging from $58 to $61.50a share.   Alfred Zeien, president-elect of the company, was thebiggest seller, with a 15,000-share sale at $60.25 a share onNov. 30, the filings show. His direct holdings now total68,900 shares, according to the filings, which show that theNovember sale was option-related.   Mr. Zeien couldn't be reached for comment. A Gillettespokesman said the sales by Mr. Zeien and the other insiderswere related to &quot;year-end financial planning adjustments.&quot;   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Gilletteclosed Monday at $61.125, up 25 cents.   -- Three insiders at Geico Corp., including the chairman,sold shares of the Washington-based insurer in late November,according to SEC filings.
