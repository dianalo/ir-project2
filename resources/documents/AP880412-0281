(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former top salesman for US SprintCommunications Co. told stockholders of one of the company's parentcorporations Tuesday that US Sprint is rife with mismanagement andhe should become its president.   Paul Walton, who last year received a $1.74 million settlementfrom US Sprint over unpaid commissions, said US Sprint's managementis ``totally out of touch'' with the telecommunications industry.   ``Management's thinking is years behind the times,'' Walton saidin an interview following the annual meeting of UnitedTelecommunications Inc. of Westwood, a suburb of Kansas City, Mo.   United Telecom is joint owner of US Sprint with GTE Corp. ofStamford, Conn.   Walton, a 32-year-old former school teacher from San Diego, hascampaigned from college campuses to Wall Street in an attempt tooust Robert Snedaker as president of US Sprint. He's also callingattention to billing problems that have plagued the company sinceits formation in 1986.   Because US Sprint's president is not elected but is chosen by asix-member partnership committee of United Telecom and GTE, Waltonwants shareholders to pressure company officials to put him incharge.   Walton got a cool reception from the approximately 200 peopleattending the meeting.   ``I think he means well but Sprint is showing signs of comingaround,'' said Marvin Bell of Lenexa, Kan., a shareholder. ``Whathe's saying really isn't an issue any more.''   US Sprint, based in Kansas City, Mo., is the nation'sthird-largest long-distance telephone company behind AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp.   US Sprint lost $1.1 billion last year on revenues of $3.1billion. Analysts have predicted that the company would lose from$115 million to $140 million in the quarter that ended March 31.   William T. Esrey, United Telecom's president and chief executiveofficer, conceded Tuesday that US Sprint's losses for the firstquarter of 1988 likely would be more than the $116 million loss inthe last quarter of 1987.   US Sprint probably won't turn a profit in 1988 but its lossesshould decline in 1988, Esrey said. He told stockholders that USSprint's fiber-optic long-distance telephone network and othertechnological advancements would boost its share of the market andhelp trim losses.   Esrey also said the billing problems _ some customers weren'tbilled for months or have been charged for calls they didn't make _have been cleared up.   However, Walton, who was fired in July 1986 after sending aletter to Esrey complaining about customer service and notreceiving commissions on some of the 600,000 Sprint accounts he hadsigned up, challenged Esrey's remarks.   ``Everywhere I go, people come up to me and tell me horrorstories about US Sprint,'' he said. ``Their service hasn't beenconnected, they don't receive bills, they're billed for calls theydon't make or a collection agency is after them because ofcompany-caused errors. There's just no excuse.''   Esrey declined to comment on Walton's charges, but agreed withWalton that the price of the company's stock should be higher.   Walton said he also will appear at GTE's stockholders' meetingApril 20.   Walton and his supporters have handed out T-shirts, buttons andbumper stickers promoting his candidacy, which he expects to cost$60,000.   ``It's clear that they don't know the best ways of running thecompany,'' he said. ``I'm willing to roll up my sleeves and work18-hour days, seven days a week, like I once did for this company.We need a change in management, change in direction and anentrepreneurial approach.''</TEXT></DOC>
