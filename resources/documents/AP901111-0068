The 9-foot-tall, 5-foot-wide granite statue was dedicated Oct.28 in Brooklyn's Greenpoint section to honor the Rev. JerzyPopieluszko, a pro-Solidarity Roman Catholic priest killed byPolish secret police in 1984. More than 50,000 Polish immigrantslive in Greenpoint.   Many of the 1,000 parishioners attending the 11 a.m. Mass at OurLady of Consolation on Sunday wept when the Rev. John Lazar toldthem of the vandalism, which occured overnight. No one claimedresponsibility.   ``Many of the immigrants in the area are from the diocese wherehe served,'' Lazar said later. ``Many had heard his pro-Solidarityand anti-Communist talks firsthand. Some of them knew him.''   The head of the statue erected at the intersection of LorimerStreet and Bedford Avenue was found in a nearby trash can, saidpolice Officer Scott Bloch. The words, ``Za Lenina Za Stalina,''Polish for ``For Lenin, for Stalin,'' were scrawled in black painton the statue base.   Lazar said it was a ``tremendous triumph'' for many Polishimmigrants to see the statue dedicated at a ceremony attended byPolish Bishop Joseph Wysocki.   Now, ``there is shock and disbelief,'' Lazar said. ``Althoughthe priest has been dead for six years he stays very much alive inthe hearts and memories of the Polish people.''   He said some Polish residents view the vandalism as an extensionof the violence that caused Popieluszko's death.   Until the statue was dedicated, private security guards watchedthe location because threats had been made that the statue would bedefaced or destroyed, Lazar said.   Popieluszko, whose sermons bolstered the Solidarity labormovement when it was outlawed, was abducted Oct. 19, 1984. Hisbeaten and bound body was pulled from an icy river 11 days later,shocking Poland and galvanizing the anti-Communist movement.   Four secret policemen were convicted of the slaying.</TEXT></DOC>
