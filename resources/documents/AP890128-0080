Their jerky movements betray their nervousness.   At the airport across the city, an Afghan army general sees off afamily on a flight to India.   A man standing nearby, who assumes it is the general's family,observes bitterly: ``See, he's getting them out _ he can afford to.''</TEXT><TEXT>   This is Kabul.   As the last days slip away before the Soviet army is due to leaveAfghanistan by Feb. 15, a 10-year civil war rages on, nobody knowswhat will happen next, suspicion and fear are widespread, and no onelooks like a winner.   Without the Soviets, the survival prospects of the pro-Marxistregime of President Najib are counted in months by most Westerndiplomats in Kabul.   The seven groups of Moslem rebels, whose commanders control greatswaths of the countryside as warlords, are divided among themselves.   Hundreds of towns and villages are wrecked by Soviet and Afghanbombing raids, an estimated 1 million people have been killed in theconflict and 5 million _ a third of the population _ have fled toPakistan and Iran.   The Soviet Union, whose costly military intervention began in1979, stands condemned by the West and many Third World countries asan occupying superpower that met with gallant resistance fromguerrilla fighters.</TEXT><TEXT>   On the drab, icy streets of Kabul, the Soviets look like weariedcolonial administrators in the dying days of an empire as theydistribute airlifted emergency rations from armored vehicles to coldand hungry crowds who throng handout points, even though they saythey're delighted the Red Army is going.   Soviet commanders, keen to publicize the handouts and coy aboutthe withdrawal and whether promises of continued military assistanceto Najib will include more bombing raids, grumble openly aboutAfghan inefficiency.   ``The local administration did not give out the orders in timefor when they needed to get food supplies,'' said Maj. Gen. LevSerebrov, No. 2 in the Soviet high command here, and the traders arehoarding to raise prices.   Still, he acknowledges that Moscow's Afghan adventure has gonewrong.   ``We came here with a very honorable task, with open hearts ...we are leaving, and we have a sense of not having accomplished ourmission to the end,'' he told Western reporters.   The Kabul mayor, Afghan army Gen. Mohammad Hakim, claims the cityhas a three-month stockpile of food and fuel to withstand anyblockade by rebels _ now entrenched on the outskirts _ once theSoviets go.   But Western diplomats say reserves are virtually exhausted. U.N.aid officials warn that without more emergency supplies the capitalof more than 2 million people, half of them war refugees from theprovinces, faces disaster.   The West provides little more than token aid, refusing to dealwith Najib's administration.   The Soviets, meanwhile, appear unwilling to ditch Najib, or totake him off to Moscow in the hope of forging a last-minuteagreement on a coalition in which the rebel leaders would sit withat least some of the Marxists.</TEXT><TEXT>   Despite the efforts of the Soviets, Najib's People's DemocraticParty of Afghanistan and a 35,000-strong secret police, the Khad,the hold of Marxism appears as shaky as everything else.   A state silo supplies the flour, but private traders increase thebread prices in shanty-like stores.   In the bazaars the money changers operate as openly as the rugtraders. A U.S. dollar now fetches 230 Afghans, up from 180 a fewmonths ago and more than four times the official rate.   This is a city where a money trader seated on upturned crate inthe street solemnly checks the passports of foreign customers; wherelines of vehicles waiting for fuel encircle blocks while blackmakerteers tip cans from street-side hoards into the tanks of thebetter off.   Bursts of small arms fire and explosions ring out at night.   No one seems sure who's doing the shooting, but the victims _with gunshot and land mine wounds _ turn up at the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross' overburdened hospital.   Plainclothes militia have joined the soldiers on the streets,setting up their own checkpoints.</TEXT><TEXT>   The small group of Western journalists in Kabul are gathered atthe Intercontinental Hotel, on a hillside overlooking the capital.It is the sole hotel in the city with a telex and the only one leftwith central heating.   Even there, power cuts are frequent.   The Foreign Ministry tries to keep a close watch on reporters,assigning them guides-interpreters with English ranging for thehesistant to the fluent.   The cars supplied by the state operate on near-empty tanksreplenished a few gallons at a time on the black market by driverswho pay with sheafs of local currency they haul around in carrierbags.   The Foreign Ministry, inundated with visa applications fromjournalists, clamped down on issuing new visas in early January.   Western diplomats suspect the move followed orders from theSoviet high command seeking to pull troops out of the capital withthe minimum of publicity. The Foreign Ministry says it acted becauseit does not have enough interpreters _ known by reporters as``minders'' _ and cars to cope.</TEXT><TEXT>   Meanwhile, the quiet Soviet pullout continues.   The Soviets have handed over some key perimeter posts round thecity to the Afghan army, stripped army recreation rooms at theairport, and head north in armored columns up the 250-mile Salanghighway to the Soviet border.   Under a U.N.-mandated agreeement, 50,000 Soviet troops inAfghanistan left by Aug. 15 and the remaining 50,000 are to be goneby the February deadline.   Embassies, including the Soviet Embassy, have run down theirstaffs and evacuated foreign families.   Whatever happens after the Soviets go, it is hard to find anAfghan who believes there will be peace.   ``It's all been a big mistake, the war, the Soivets cominghere,'' said airline mechanic Anargul Eshaqza, as he waited in agasline fuel line.   ``Peace? Maybe in another 10 years.''</TEXT></DOC>
