Whether the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. loses money dependson how much it costs the government to rescue First RepublicBankCorp. of Dallas, FDIC chairman L. William Seidman told reportersMonday.   The deterioration of Texas banks, hard hit by losses on realestate and energy loans, has raised concern about the health of thefund, which backs deposits of up to $100,000 in 13,700 commercialbanks.   Earlier this month, the FDIC pumped $1 billion into FirstRepublicBank, the largest bank company in Texas, to stem a run ondeposits.   Seidman said in a luncheon speech it is too soon to tell howmuch more it will cost to fully restore the bank's health. But hesaid published estimates of $5 billion to $6 billion are ``farhigher than anything likely to be required.''   A better guide, he said, would be the $1.7 billion it cost thegovernment in 1984 to rescue Continental Illinois Bank andamp; Trust Co.,which was about the same size as First RepublicBank.   If the bailout is in that range and if banks, as expected, failat about the same rate as last year, then the FDIC's 1988 losswould be ``something under 5 percent ... certainly under ... $1billion,'' Seidman said.   He said he did not see any prospect for what he termed asubstantial loss, one approaching 20 percent, or about $3.5 billion.   Last year, the FDIC posted a slight increase even though apost-Depression record of 184 banks failed. Forty-four banks havefailed so far this year and Seidman said he expected the 1988 totalto be roughly the same as 1987.   As failures have increased, the steady growth of the FDIC fund _from $4.6 billion in 1970, to $11.6 billion in 1980 and $17.9billion in 1985 _ has slowed. The fund finished 1986 with $18.2billion and 1987 with $18.3 billion.   Seidman contrasted the relatively healthy condition of the FDICfund with that of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,which insures deposits in 3,170 savings institutions.   FSLIC was insolvent until last fall, when money began flowingfrom congressionally authorized bond sales. It has had to keepbankrupt Sandamp;Ls open because it lacked the money to pay offdepositors.</TEXT></DOC>
