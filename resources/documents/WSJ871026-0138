Last July, the company announced it was in &quot;substantive discussions&quot; that could lead to a merger with an alternative energy company it wouldn't identify. At the time, the company said the transaction would enhance its ability to raise capital, build its management team and improve cash flow.    Conversion Industries develops hydroelectric, cogeneration, small power production and waste-to-energy facilities.    Separately, a unit of Conversion Industries said $395 million of bonds, issued to enable it to build a waste-to-energy facility, have been redeemed because of uncertainty over the tax status of the bonds.    The adjustable-rate revenue bonds were issued by the Irwindale Resource Recovery Authority, a city agency in Irwindale, Calif., in December 1984. The funds have been held in escrow to finance the construction of the energy facility in Irwindale.    The Conversion Industries unit, Pacific Waste Management, is the developer of the project. However, the unit said its lawyers declined to issue an opinion stating that the bonds qualified for tax-exempt status, and the bonds were redeemed. </TEXT></DOC>
