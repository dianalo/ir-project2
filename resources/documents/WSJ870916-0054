Officials of the Association for Promotion of International Trade said they are concerned that Japan's trade with China may dwindle following a tightening of government controls on shipments to communist countries.    The government acted following the disclosure that Toshiba Machine Co., a unit of Toshiba Corp., sold sophisticated milling machines to the Soviet Union in violation of rules governing exports to communist countries. In addition to its efforts to toughen export controls, the government has banned Toshiba Machine from exporting to communist countries for one year.    Association officials asked the government to simplify the procedures for exports to China in general and to shorten the period for inspecting China-bound shipments. They also asked MITI to allow Toshiba Machine to carry out the contracts it had concluded with China before the discovery of its milling-machine exports to the Soviet Union. Those contracts are reported to amount to more than two billion yen ($14 million).    MITI told the association that the government is aware of various problems arising from its decision to tighten export regulations, but it stopped short of promising action, an association official said.    The Japanese newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported during the weekend that MITI and the Foreign Ministry are considering plans to allow Toshiba Machine to execute the contracts it had concluded with China. But officials at MITI and the Foreign Ministry called the report groundless. They said such a step hasn't come up for consideration at either of the ministries and hasn't been discussed between the two bodies. </TEXT></DOC>
