That theme was heard often during the two weeks of floor debateon the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, ratifiedFriday by a 93-5 vote, and is likely to continue for any futurearms agreements.   ``The Senate has clearly made visible that it is an equalpartner with any president in the making of treaties,'' said SenateMajority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. ``And I hope that will be asobering impact on this president and Mr. Gorbachev when they sitdown and discuss another agreement.''</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Union indicated Saturday it might slowthe withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan if Pakistan keeps aidingthe Afghan guerrillas, and it accused Washington of fueling the warwith ``lavish supplies'' to the rebels.   The Foreign Ministry statement came one day before PresidentReagan's arrival in Moscow for his fourth summit with Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev. The Soviet threat appeared likely to push theAfghan war toward the top of the agenda during meetings between thetwo leaders.   The Soviets said if Pakistan did not halt ``interference in theinternal affairs of Afghanistan,'' they would ``draw pertinentconclusions with respect to the timetable of the troop withdrawaland take concrete steps.''</TEXT><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Safety Council may be best known forits grim projections of highway death tolls on holiday weekends,but its leaders wince at their perceived role as ``body counters.''   The council's warnings about the risks of holiday travel arejust a small part of its public-education effort to save lives andprevent accidents by making Americans more careful, said T.C.Gilchrest, the organization's president.   The mission is the same as when the council was founded 75 yearsago by representatives of industry, railroads and insurancecompanies concerned about the loss of lives and production.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration's failed effort toinduce Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega to surrender powerwas riddled with blunders and miscalculations, according to anumber of independent experts.   But while many of the experts found fault with the way theadministration handled the negotiations, they had few ideas on whatthe United States can do now to achieve its goals of an apoliticalmilitary and restoring constitutional rule in Panama.   ``We're in for the long haul,'' said Eva Loser of the Center forStrategic and International Studies.   To some experts, the United States looked both foolish and weakafter Noriega refused last Wednesday to sign on to a U.S.-brokeredpackage deal that called for his resignation in August andtemporary departure from Panama while an election process tookplace.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secrets about U.S. intelligence operations inIran and efforts to free Americans held hostage in Lebanon areamong the blizzard of classified documents demanded from thegovernment by Oliver L. North and his three Iran-Contraco-defendants.   Some of the documents sought in the defense's extensivepre-trial discovery motion are so sensitive, independent counselLawrence E. Walsh has said, that their courtroom disclosure wouldjeopardize intelligence activities and could expose ``people invery difficult situations to torture and death'' in the Middle East.   District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell will have to rule on whether toorder Walsh to give the defense the documents sought in the 88-pagediscovery motion. But the judge already has said the defense isentitled to review any papers that are relevant to the defense.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis is the biggest tax raiser and taxcutter in Massachusetts history, a dual distinction that puts himin a curious position as a Democratic presidential candidate.   The likely nominee can accurately lay claim to the tax-cuttertitle. But Republican nominee-in-waiting George Bush can just ascorrectly claim Dukakis is a tax-raiser.   The Massachusetts governor talks frequently of cutting taxeswhile mopping up Republican deficits, a pitch aimed at votersworried about the federal deficit. But Dukakis is mindful ofDemocratic nominee Walter Mondale's frank 1984 statement that hewould raise taxes if elected president, a promise that contributedto his defeat.</TEXT><DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush will part company withPresident Reagan on a variety of domestic issues in a campaign thatwill also portray Democrat Michael Dukakis' management record as afailed one, two Republican governors said Saturday.   Govs. John Sununu of New Hampshire and James Thompson ofIllinois told reporters that Bush was working to develop a packageof new proposals on child care, the homeless, housing, educationand drug education.   ``The vice president is a man firmly committed to setting hisown agenda. I don't think there was any doubt about that at all,''Thompson said after two days of strategy meetings at Bush'soceanside vacation retreat.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A French photographer held nine monthsin an Afghan prison was freed Saturday and said police had debatedwhether to formally arrest him or kill him and blame guerrillas whobrought him into the country.   ``I wasn't treated too badly but I was morally brutalized,''said Alain Guillo, 45. ``For the first four months, I had nonewspapers, books or paper. I was always under surveillance anddeprived of fundamental rights.''   Guillo, who spoke to reporters after arriving in New Delhi, leftthe Indian capital for Paris early Sunday. He was freed in Kabulafter Gilbert Perol, secretary-general of the French ForeignMinistry, presented a letter from President Francois Mitterrand toAfghan leader Najib.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Although he has often railed againstprotectionist trade legislation, President Reagan has erected moreanti-consumer trade barriers than any president since HerbertHoover, says a former top Reagan economic adviser.   William Niskanen, a former member of Reagan's Council ofEconomic Advisers, said that time after time the administration hasbowed to industry pressure to block imports.   In one industry alone, autos, Niskanen estimated that theadministration's policies ended up costing American consumers $1.1billion annually in higher car costs. He said that worked out to$240,000 for each job saved in the domestic auto industry.</TEXT><DATELINE>DAKHLA, Western Sahara (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Morocco is making so much headwaywinning people over in this long-disputed territory that it nolonger fears a referendum on independence among the inhabitants.   Exemption from taxes and import duties, development projects andan apparently unlimited supply of fresh water _ most precious ofall commodities in the desert _ have helped undermine the supportonce enjoyed by the Polisario independence movement.   The hardest blow suffered by Polisario, which Algeria supports,was the announcement May 17 that Algeria and Morocco had restoreddiplomatic relations after 12 years of hovering on the brink of warover the Sahara.</TEXT></DOC>
