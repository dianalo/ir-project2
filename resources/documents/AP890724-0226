Franklin Williams</BYLINE><DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The message today is simple: BEWARE THESUMMER SUN!   Too many people, especially older people, become needlessly illbecause they fail to recognize the potential dangers of the sun andits heat. However, the two great dangers, heatstroke and skincancer, are largely preventable.   Symptoms of heatstroke occur almost instantly and can beimmediately fatal, while skin cancer develops years after exposureto the sun's rays.   If you must be exposed to the heat, drink plenty of water orfruit and vegetable juice, even if you aren't thirsty. Avoidalcohol and caffeine. Dress in light-weight, light-colored, looseclothes. Limit activity in the hottest part of the day and keepmeals simple and light. If they are available, use air conditionersliberally. Trips to cool places are good alternatives.   If you are a relative, friend, or neighbor of a person who isunable to get around you may want to offer transportation.   Older people are especially vulnerable to heat-relatedillnesses. Changes in the body that may affect ability to cope withheat include inefficient sweat glands, poor circulation and changesin the skin. Also, some older people have illnesses that causeweakness or fever which, in turn, affect their ability to cope withheat. Heart, lung, and kidney diseases are good examples.   Diseases requiring special diets also may make a person morevulnerable to heatstroke. People with high blood pressure, forexample, reduce the amount of salt in their diets. Yet thisreduction may increase the risk of heat stress. (A word of caution_ salt should not be increased nor salt supplements taken withoutconsent from a physician.)   Medications like diuretics, sedatives, tranquilizers and certainheart and blood-pressure drugs may contribute to a body's inabilityto regulate internal temperature. But never stop medication orchange a recommended diet without consulting a doctor. Unusuallyheavy or underweight people also are at risk, as are those whodrink alcoholic beverages regularly.   Anyone suspected of suffering a heat-related illness shouldreceive attention. Victims of heatstroke exhibit a body temperatureof 104 degrees or higher. The pulse may be rapid. Other symptomsinclude flushed skin, a faint feeling, confused and bizarrebehavior and combativeness. These symptoms require immediateemergency medical assistance.   Heat fatigue and heat exhaustion are milder forms of heatstress. Should you suspect either illness look for giddiness,nausea, profuse sweating, and a cold and clammy feeling and takesteps to prevent the condition from worsening.   First, and perhaps most obvious, the person needs to get out ofthe sun and into a cool, preferably air-conditioned place.Encourage sponging off with cool water or taking a cool bath orshower and non-alcoholic, non-caffeinated drink.   Another serious danger associated with the sun and aging is skincancer.   Whether you are 15 or 50 your skin is accumulating sun damage,including wrinkling, various growths and skin cancers and change intexture. By following some easy sun-safety tips many skin cancerscan be prevented.   Don't sunbathe too long. Try to limit exposure between 10 a.m.and 3 p.m. and get used to the sun gradually. Wear a hat,long-sleeved shirt, and W-rated (ultraviolet) sunglasses. Usesunscreens liberally and apply them at least one hour before goingout. Reapply after swimming or sweating. Sunscreens are effectiveat SPF (sun protection factor) 15.   Prolonged exposure to the sun can cause skin cancer. The mostcommon forms are basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma andmalignant melanoma.   Basal cell carcinomas are the most common and rarely harmful tovital organs. Squamous cell carcinomas are less common but arepotentially harmful because they can grow quickly and spread toother organs. Malignant melanomas often look like dark, irregularmoles. They can be deadly.   If you suspect skin cancer see a doctor. Warning signs include anew mole-type spot or changes in color, size, shape or texture ofan existing one. With early detection and prompt treatment, manyskin cancers can be cured. Even if you have had a benign cancer youmust guard against the dangers of the sun.   With good, sound judgment and a knowledge of preventive measuresthe hot summer months can be safe and fun for everyone.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 27</NOTE></DOC>
