(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   School officials in a small southwesternMissouri town need more guidance before they can respond to afederal order striking down their ban on school-sponsored dancing,according to their attorney.   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark ruled last month that the banon dancing at Purdy High School was unconstitutional because itpromoted the values of those who oppose dancing for religiousreasons.   The judge said it was not his role to order the district to holddances, but he said the district could not enforce a no-dance rulethat some believe to be a century old.   ``Defendants respectfully submit that they do not understandwhat the court is ordering them to do or refrain from doing,''wrote school district attorney Ransom Ellis III in a brief filedThursday.   But lawyer William Fleischaker, representing the 21 young peopleand parents who challenged the ban, said ``there's no question inmy mind'' about the order.   ``Any efforts by the school district to unreasonably prevent thestudents from having a dance would be in contempt of that order,''Fleischaker said.   Fleischaker said Ellis' request for a clarification was``typical of what's gone on all along here _ the school districthas abandoned responsibility. They said, `We can't allow dancingbecause of the rule.' Now they're saying, `We don't know what wehave to do. Judge, you tell us what we have to do.' They've run forschool board, let them use some responsibility.''   The Purdy school system, centered in a town of about 900 people50 miles southwest of Springfield, has about 520 pupils.   Clark did not address Ellis' arguments at a hearing Friday,during which the judge considered the amount of attorney fees to beawarded the pro-dance lawyers. The judge said he would make hisfinal ruling in the case by the end of next week.</TEXT></DOC>
