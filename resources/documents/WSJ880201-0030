Mr. Maxwell may act if the Paris government blocks the Pearson bid, the spokesman said. French analysts think the government may oppose the offer because of political doubts about Rupert Murdoch, who recently acquired about 20% of Pearson. Mr. Murdoch was born in Australia but is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Senior French government officials, habitually leery of non-European control over their media, worry the Pearson purchase could give Mr. Murdoch a strong voice in Les Echos' affairs.    Mr. Maxwell thinks his own fast-growing media business would be a politically preferable buyer for Les Echos, the spokesman said.    A spokesman for Pearson, a London-based group that publishes Britain's Financial Times newspaper, said, &quot;We don't foresee any problems with the French authorities.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
