In the same issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 33929), the agency issued a final rulethat removed the listing for hydrogenated 4,4'-isopropylidene-diphenolphosphiteester resins from andSection; 178.2010 <T3>Antioxidants and/or stabilizers for polymers </T3>(21 CFR 178.2010).FDA took these actions because adverse neurological effects were observedin a study in which dogs were fed the additive, and because there are nostudies that establish safe conditions of use for this additive. FDA gave interested persons 60 days (until November 9, 1987) to file commentson the proposal to list hydrogenated 4,4'-isopropylidene-diphenolphosphiteester resins in 21 CFR Part 189 and 30 days (until October 9, 1987) tofile objections to the revocation of its listing in the food additive regulations.No comments were received on the proposal (52 FR 33952), and no objectionsor requests for a hearing were received in response to the final rule (52FR 33929) revoking the use of the additive. Therefore, FDA is listing hydrogenated4,4' isopropylidene-diphenolphosphite ester resins as substances prohibitedfrom use in food-contact surfaces, as proposed. The agency has previously considered the environmental effects of thisrule as announced in the proposed rule (52 FR 33952). No new informationor comments have been received that would affect the agency's previousdetermination that there is no significant impact on the human environmentand that an environmental impact statement is not required. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency previouslyconsidered the potential effects that this rule would have on small entities,including small businesses. In accordance with section 605(b) of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, the agency has determined that no significant impact ona substantial number of small entities would derive from this action. FDAhas not received any new information or comments that would alter its previousdetermination.In accordance with Executive Order 12291, FDA has previously evaluatedthe economic impact of this final rule. The agency has determined thatthe final rule is not a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291.The agency's findings of no major economic impact and no significant impacton a substantial number of small entities, and the evidence supportingthese findings, are contained in a threshold assessment displayed in theDockets Management Branch (address above).Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at anytime on or before March 20, 1989, file with the Dockets Management Branch(address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separatelynumbered, and each numbered objection shall specify with particularitythe provisions of the regulation to which objection is made and the groundsfor the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requestedshall specifically so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particularobjection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection.Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall includea detailed description and analysis of the specific factual informationintended to be presented in support of the objection in the event thata hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis forany particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearingon the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted andshall be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the headingof this document. Any objections received in response to the regulationmay be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 189 </ITAG>Food ingredients, Food packaging, Prohibited food ingredients.Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authoritydelegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Part 189 is amended asfollows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 189_SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED FROM USE IN HUMAN FOOD </ITAG>1.
