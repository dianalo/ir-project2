Secretary for Security John Barnes and the British colony'spolitical adviser, Richard Clift, were to begin two days ofnegotiations in Hanoi on Monday.   Barnes said last week after returning from the Geneva conferenceon Indochinese refugees that Hong Kong's aim ``is to get allVietnamese out of Hong Kong, both refugees and non-refugees ... byresettlement, by repatriation, whichever.''   He said he was encouraged by Vietnam's expressed willingness atGeneva to hold bilateral talks with any participating countries.   At the 60-nation Geneva talks, Hong Kong and Britain argued forforced repatriation but were opposed by the United States and theSoviet Union. Vietnam has said it will take back only refugeesreturning on their own accord.   So far, only 143 Vietnamese have returned home from Hong Kong.   More than 44,000 Vietnamese are now in Hong Kong and officialssay most are not refugees from political persecution but illegalimmigrants seeking better economic conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
