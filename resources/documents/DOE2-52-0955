From radiometricdating and varve counts, it has been determined that the initiation ofanoxic conditions commenced about 180 years ago and increase to the present.The rate of growth appears to have declined in the past few decades.The center of deepest thickness of laminated undisturbed sediments isoffset to the northwest from the actual bathymetric deepest point, whichsuggests that the condition is related to deep-basin circulation. Theperiod since about 1800 coincides with the development of western settlementand population growth in southern California, beginning with the missionperiod and the establishment of the early pueblos. Rapid expansion ofthe zone during the 19th and early 20th centuries appears to parallelthe growth of land development. There does not seem to be a climaticcorrelation and the only exceptional event at about the time of initiationof anoxic conditions is the Mission Quake of 1811. This event triggeredlarge turbidity-current flows, but such large influxes of sediment andcontained organic matter would not upset the oxygen demand balance formore than a few years given normal mixing and overturn of the deep basinwaters. The continued growth of the zone with time suggests a continuingperturbation of the system and is most easily correlated with the anthropogeniceffect of coastal land development and resulting introduction of oxygen-demandingwastes to the basin floor.</TEXT></DOC>
