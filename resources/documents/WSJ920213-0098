Dozens of companies, including General Electric Co.,Allied-Signal Inc., Marriott Corp., PepsiCo Inc. and XeroxCorp. have flooded the FCC with letters protesting the policychange.</LP><TEXT>   The August decision was complicated, and at the time fewcustomers understood its implications. The FCC ruled thatbecause ATandamp;T dominates the market for 800 service, thetelephone giant couldn't continue to offer new custompackages that included 800 service until early next year.   By then, new technology in local phone networks isexpected to permit 800 customers to change theirlong-distance carrier and take their 800 number with them.That's important because many companies have spent hugeamounts to promote their 800 numbers or have such numbersspell words; under the FCC ruling, they would have to give upthose numbers if they switch long-distance carriers.   So the FCC grandfathered existing packages, known asTariff 12 options. While some individual Tariff 12 optionshave attracted several companies, most are used by singlecustomers. About 150 companies, including long-distanceresellers, have signed multiyear contracts for the services.   ATandamp;T can offer existing options that include 800 serviceas well as new packages with no 800 service. To close apotential loophole, the agency in December began rejectingrequests for substantial revisions that would enable ATandamp;T totailor old packages with 800 service to fit new customers. &quot;Asubstantial modification is a way to make grandfathering ajoke,&quot; said James Spurlock of the Common Carrier Bureau.   Nevertheless, the commission is likely to modify itsAugust decision to address unrest among customers, perhaps bythe end of the month.   ATandamp;T wants the commission to reconsider its whole decisionwhile its rivals want the agency to grandfather customersrather than tariff options. &quot;Had the commission grandfatheredcustomers and not options, it would not be in thispredictament,&quot; said Donald Elardo, director of regulatory lawfor MCI Communications Corp.   ATandamp;T and its customers have complained that the wholematter hinders good business decisions and flies in the faceof President Bush's push to halt unneeded regulation.   In a letter yesterday to FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes and thefour other commissioners, Thomas Norris, an ATandamp;T vicepresident, asked the agency to reconsider the Augustdecision.   In addition, ATandamp;T wants to be able to introduce or changeservices or cut prices on one day's notice, down from thereview periods that range from 14 to 45 days. ATandamp;T figuresthat the lag cost customers roughly $100 million last year.</TEXT></DOC>
