Pete Wilson proposed a sweeping $628million program for protecting the state's environment, oneof the most ambitious ever by a state.   The plan includes measures aimed at preservingCalifornia's rivers, trees and animals, largely through aprogram of buying land and habitat and placing them understate protection. The plan could influence policies elsewherein the nation, since California's approaches to environmentaland regulatory matters are often copied by other states.</LP><TEXT>   The Republican governor, to the delight and surprise ofsome environmentalists, also embraced some positions that thestate's business interests have battled for years. Forexample, the governor called for restrictions on timberharvests and proposed funding for protecting wetlands, whichin many areas are under siege from developers trying to turnthem into housing tracts. He also wants to strengthen someregulatory bodies, such as the state's Board of Forestry,which critics contend have been stacked in favor of theindustries they are supposed to regulate.   &quot;All in all, it's a tremendously encouraging and positiveapproach,&quot; said Jerry Meral, executive director of thePlanning and Conservation League, an environmental group.   The proposal may be limited by the state's fiscalproblems, however. Gov. Wilson intends to finance the programwith a $628 million bond issue, which would be put to votersin June 1992. But it's uncertain whether voters will approveit, especially if the state's deficit, which is spinningtoward $12 billion, isn't under control by then.   Moreover, tax increases which the Legislature will have toimpose to cope with the deficit could also limit enthusiasmfor the environmental bond issue. And the Legislature, whichhas distinguished itself in recent years by getting boggeddown in paralyzing partisan disputes, has to approve many ofthe specific environmental measures. Business interests arelikely to lobby strongly against some proposals.   Nonetheless, Gov. Wilson's program is among the mostexpensive and comprehensive ever proposed by a state onbehalf of the environment and was seen as an indicator of theenhanced political stature of the environment. &quot;The publiccares about the environment and political leaders have torespond to that,&quot; Mr. Meral said.   Among other things, the governor's plan earmarks $300million for buying forests, including 3,000 acres ofso-called old growth redwoods known as the Headwaters Forest,near Eureka. The trees are currently owned by Pacific LumberCo., which is controlled by Texas financier Charles Hurwitz.The towering trees are the tallest and oldest symbols of thebitter clashes Mr. Hurwitz has had with environmentalistssince he acquired Pacific Lumber in a 1986 leveraged buy-outand drastically increased the pace of cutting on its lands,largely to generate money to make debt payments.   The state money could enter into negotiations betweenenvironmentalists and federal thrift regulators who ownhundreds of millions of dollars of Pacific Lumber junk bondsas a result of Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association's failureearlier this year. Environmentalists, regulators and companyand state officials have for months been discussing possibleways to link a sale of the bonds with a transfer of theHeadwaters Forest to a conservancy or some other entity thatwould spare them from the chainsaw.</TEXT></DOC>
