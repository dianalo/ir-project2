Motorola wowed the industry in early 1989 with a newmicroprocessor called the 68040, only to hold up massproduction of the chip repeatedly because of design flaws.Motorola now pledges to start shipping the part in quantityin October, computer makers say, as much as nine months laterthan it first promised.</LP><TEXT>   Even if the chip maker meets its latest deadline, thesnafu already has forced the computer makers that rely onMotorola to delay significantly the introduction of theirnext generation of machines. In the industry's fast-pacedgame of leapfrog, with computer makers regularly outdoingeach other, such delays can spell big losses in market share.   The delay's biggest casualty is Hewlett-Packard Palo Alto,Calif., a loyal Motorola customer that planned to use the68040 as the &quot;brain&quot; in more than half of its workstations byyear end. HP has watched its market share slide -- blaming,in part, the elusive Motorola chip. &quot;If we had the 040 today,we would probably be stronger in the workstation business,&quot;says Douglas Johnson, product-marketing manager for HP'sMotorola-based computers.   The tardy chip also may delay the shipment of a newmachine by Next Inc., the Redwood City, Calif., workstationstart-up founded by Steven P. Jobs. And smaller computermakers say they have delayed machines by as much as a yearbecause of the belated chip.   To understand the overdue chip's impact, imagine GeneralMotors Corp. facing a nine-month delay in getting engines forits new-model autos while rivals sell their new cars as fastas they can. Motorola's computer-company customers lack the&quot;engines,&quot; the 68040 chips, that they need to control themachines they were ready to build as early as January. Whilethey wait, they must watch competitors grab markets usingrival chips, including Intel Corp.'s top-of-the-line 80486microprocessor and Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Sparc chip.   Motorola stands to lose market share, too, though itgarners only a small fraction of its revenue frommicroprocessor sales. As Motorola is fine-tuning its 68040,Intel is expected to sell 230,000 of its 80486 chip this yearand 880,000 in 1991, according to market researcher In-StatInc. Motorola, Schaumburg, Ill., already is a distant secondto Intel, Santa Clara, Calif., in chip sales, partly becauseit didn't win wide acceptance for earlier chips in its 68000family.   Moreover, Motorola's foray into a popular new technology,called reduced instruction-set computing (RISC), is running adistant third behind RISC chips designed by Sun, MountainView, Calif., and Mips Computer Systems Inc., Sunnyvale,Calif.   &quot;The 040 fiasco certainly hurts Motorola's credibility,&quot;says analyst Robert Herwick at Hambrecht andamp; Quist. &quot;Most ofthe market has already thrown the 68000 {series} into theground. This is the last dirt on the coffin.&quot;   Motorola's stock hasn't been doing well, either. It took aterrible beating yesterday, after analyst James Barlage ofSmith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. reduced his recommendationon the stock to &quot;avoid&quot; because of lower electronics-industrygrowth expectations. The shares closed at $61.50, down$7.625, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Withalmost 2.3 million shares changing hands, it was the mostactive stock on the Big Board.   Not everyone is so concerned. Apple Computer Inc.,Cupertino, Calif., a longtime user of Motorola chips, saysthere haven't been any adverse effects so far on its plans todevelop a 68040-based Macintosh. HP says it won't abandon the68000 family. And most traditional Motorola users praise the68040 as an excellent design that stalwart &quot;Motorola bigots,&quot;in industry parlance, will wait for.   But enemy camps are gaining converts among new customers.&quot;I don't think there's any question that new buyers are goingto look elsewhere first,&quot; says analyst Alice Leeper atDataquest Inc., a market-research firm.   That's what Unisys Corp. found. The company planned tosell a 68040-based machine this summer, says John Chen, vicepresident of the Unix systems division of Unisys, Blue Bell,Pa. But some customers can't wait any longer, he says, soUnisys steers them to its Intel-based products.   &quot;The scary part,&quot; Mr. Chen adds, &quot;the real competitor, isRISC.&quot; Sun-based and Mips-based machines are quickly gainingshare in the workstation market. Every month that the newMotorola chip is delayed means it is less likely to become amajor player. &quot;There's a lot of competition out there, andMotorola isn't in that competition,&quot; says Gary Thomas, vicepresident of UniFLEX Computing Ltd., a Chapel Hill, N.C.,software house that has specialized in Motorola chips but nowplans to write programs for Sun's Sparc chips, too.   The main culprit in Motorola's lateness is its chip'scomplexity. Chip makers are cramming more functions on theirwares to meet computer makers' demands for a faster, cheaperand smaller set of chips. A single 68040 contains 1.2 milliontransistors and combines functions that require as many as 50chips in most computers, says Jack Browne, director ofmarketing for Motorola microprocessors, who calls the delay&quot;pretty serious but not disastrous.&quot;   Motorola was already late when it unveiled a prototype ofthe chip in January that it planned to ship in volume by themiddle of this year. But the early samples it sent out hadscores of bugs. For instance, computer makers say they foundthe chips wouldn't work without cooling devices. There wereinstructions that didn't work. Some software caused strangeresults or froze the chip up completely.   By late spring, it was clear Motorola wasn't going to meetits schedule. This summer, Motorola was still sending outsamples with a long &quot;errata sheet,&quot; a list of the known flawsin the chip, says Joseph Ramunni, president of Dallas-basedMizar Inc., which makes computer boards. &quot;If, in fact, thereare chips that do work, we sure aren't getting them,&quot; hesays.   Bugs are commonplace in early chip versions. Intel'sbest-selling 80386 chips were shipped in high volumes withmany bugs, which were later corrected, and Intel's 80486 raninto well publicized bugs last year. But Motorola's bugs areshowing up when the competition already has viable,&quot;debugged&quot; options on the market.   As Motorola's delivery schedule dragged out this summer,HP hedged its bets by unveiling its new Series 400 computerline, which uses the older 68030 chip but can be upgraded touse a 68040. Still, the delay is &quot;having a pretty sizableimpact&quot; on HP, says analyst John Jones of MontgomerySecurities, who adds that the late chip is the biggest factorin HP's flat revenue in workstations for the last threequarters. That particularly hurts because HP has been underincreasing pressure in the workstation market. The combinedmarket share of HP and its Apollo unit fell to 25% last yearfrom about 49% in 1985, according to International Data Corp.   But while analysts say HP has the muscle to recover,start-ups aren't so confident about their future. &quot;We'veliterally got all our business depending on getting goodchips from Motorola,&quot; says Gene Manno, president of ArixCorp., a San Jose, Calif., computer company that planned toship a 68040-based machine in June. Now Arix can't sell itscomputer until at least early 1991, Mr. Manno says, and itsrevenues have fallen 10% to 15% below expectations. &quot;I'vereally got to have this part,&quot; he says. &quot;Our whole futuredepends on it.&quot;   Mr. Browne says Motorola is now &quot;on track&quot; and doesn'tforesee more delays. Customers are crossing their fingers.&quot;Now it's like the question of when's Iraq going to leaveKuwait,&quot; says Ron Stack, sales manager for General MicroSystems Inc., Montclair, Calif., which planned to sell a68040 product last January. &quot;Is it ever going to come out orwhat?&quot;   ---                    Motorola Lags Intel                   In 32-Bit Chip Market                 (In millions of dollars)                             1989 Sales         1988 Sales                                                                                                          Intel                       $560.2             $420.0   Motorola                     165.2              129.6   National Semi                 38.0               33.6   INMOS                         33.2               28.2   Fujitsu                       15.0               10.0                                                                                                          Source: In-Stat Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
