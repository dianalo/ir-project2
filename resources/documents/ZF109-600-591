 Progressneeded to implement a number of major enhancements to remaincompetitive--SQL, heterogeneous networking, a multithreaded/multiserverarchitecture to better support online transaction processing, distributeddatabase, and access to non-Progress databases.andM;It is impressive that the company has managed to do all of this whilemaintaining an integrated development environment and keeping up its qualitystandard.andM;Progress is still clearly focused on improving the applications developmentprocess.andP;  While the current tools are not yet what we want for the end user,the company plans to enhance this area shortly.andP;  In addition to a new set ofchallenges (such as supporting graphical user interfaces and providingextensible data types and functions), the major issue for Progress is one ofname recognition and market visibility.andP;  In terms of technology, Progress iscatching up with, and in some cases surpassing, its larger rivals.andP;  Now itneeds to become better known.andM;Company BackgroundandM;Progress Software was founded in 1981 to bring mainframe DBMS functionalityto the mini and workstation environments.andP;  As a result, Progress incorporatedfrom the very beginning important capabilities such as automatic crashrecovery (roll-back) procedures, automatic concurrency control, and atransaction orientation.andP;  The Progress RDBMS and application developmentlanguage was introduced in 1984.andM;The company is still privately held, with ownership split 50-50 betweenventure capital participants and employees.andP;  Revenues for the 1990 fiscalyear are projected to be $40 million, up 60 percent from $25.4 million in1989.andP;  Income figures are not available, but the company states that it hasbeen profitable since the introduction of Progress.andP;  Progress currently has265 employees.andM;ProductandM;OverviewandM;PRODUCT STRATEGY.andP;  The company's core product is the Progressfourth-generation application development language (4GL) and RDBMS software.andO;The company also offers layered products on top of Progress, such as the FastTrack applications generator and gateways to non-Progress data.andM;Progress has always emphasized its 4GL and development toolset with theoverriding objective of making the developer/programmer more productive.andP;  Andthe company projects a bright future for the applications developmentbusiness.andP;  Joe Alsop, president, sees &quot;industry trends coming our way.andP;  The'80s were focused on relational DBMSs and companies like Oracle.andP;  In the'90s, application development tools will be the primary requirement.&quot;andM;The company is also keeping its RDBMS up to snuff.andP;  The database engine hasalways provided a strong underpinning for the 4GL, and Progress has enhancedit significantly over the past two years.andP;  In the near term, we do not seeProgress packaging its 4GL as a completely separate front-end tool for otherDBMSs.andP;  The company recognizes that tools designed for one DBMS will neverwork as efficiently with another.andP;  Heterogeneous combinations usually end uppaying a performance penalty, however small.andP;  The answer, instead, is toprovide support for a heterogeneous computing environment (see Illustration1).andM;PROGRESS 4GL/RDBMS.andP;  In our last review, we looked at Version 4 of Progress.andO;Version 5, introduced in mid-1989, added a multiserver architecture andsupport for SQL.andP;  Version 6, announced in July, provides significantenhancements focused on access to multiple, heterogeneous databases.andM;Multiserver Architecture.andP;  With the advent of client/server architectures,all of the major DBMS vendors have moved toward supporting multiple databaseservers on a single platform.andP;  This improves performance, increases thenumber of users that the DBMS can support, and allows the DBMS to exploitsymmetric multiprocessing.andM;On Unix, VMS, and OS/2 systems running shared memory versions of Progress,Progress uses a multiserver architecture for remote client access to thedatabase (see Illustration 2).andP;  Local (terminal) users can access thedatabase through servers or directly through shared memory.andP;  In the lattercase, they do not require a separate server process and are called&quot;self-serving&quot; clients.andP;  This improves performance by eliminating the needfor any interprocess communication between the client and server.andP;  Thedecision to use servers for local clients is a tuning issue, trading offperformance against optimum use of fixed resources such as shared memory andsemaphores.andM;In the case of remote clients, a network service, called a broker process,manages the resources shared by remote users and is responsible for launchingservers on behalf of these clients.andP;  The broker is transparent to the client.andO;If remote clients are accessing the system using multiple network protocols,there is a broker for each protocol (e.g., a TCP/IP broker and a DECnetbroker).andP;  Each server also handles one protocol and has access to onedatabase at a time (although multiple servers can access the same database).andO;Within these constraints, multiple clients can be assigned to one server.andO;The broker will connect a new client to an existing server or spawn a newserver depending on the situation.andP;  This is a major difference betweenProgress and Oracle, for example, which sets up a separate server process forevery client.andM;The Progress multiserver architecture can be tuned by defining the maximumnumber of Progress servers and the minimum and maximum number of users perserver.andP;  Progress is multithreaded by virtue of its use of shared memory andits multiserver architecture.andP;  Each individual server is stillsingle-threaded.andM;SQL.andP;  Progress fully supports the ANSI Level 1 SQL standard plus a majorityof Level 2.andP;  Progress has structured its 4GL to accept SQL statements as wellas Progress commands.andP;  A developer can use one or the other, or mix and matchboth types of commands in a procedure.andP;  You can also include Progress-typeclauses in SQL statements to dress up the format and display of queryresults.andP;  The company has extended SQL to include capabilities such asdefining array fields.andM;Distributed Database.andP;  A Progress user/application can now dynamicallyconnect to multiple databases simultaneously (up to 240).andP;  These databasescan be either local or remote.andP;  (Previously, Progress was limited toaccessing a single database.)andP;  In addition, each Progress client or front-endprocess can support multiple network protocols concurrently.andM;Version 6 supports both distributed query processing and distributedtransaction processing.andP;  The latter requires a two-phase commit (2PC)architecture to provide data integrity during multidatabase updateoperations.andP;  The Progress 2PC is automatic.andM;Location independence is achieved by including both the logical and physicaldatabase names in the data dictionary at the client location.andP;  (Progress doesnot rely on a central data dictionary/star topology to support distributeddatabase.)andP;  With location transparency, developers and end users don't haveto know where data resides; they can access it transparently as if it weresitting on the local system.andP;  Another benefit is the ability to takeadvantage of distributed databases without rewriting existing applications.andM;Progress views the demand for distributed database more as a tool tointegrate databases than as a way to take a centralized database and split itup.andP;  An organization can optimize DBMS tools and/or engines for each databaseapplication or department and then use distributed capabilities to integratethe data where appropriate.andM;Heterogeneous Databases.andP;  Progress now offers gateways to access non-Progressdatabases--Oracle and Digital's RMS, with support for Digital's Rdb cominglater this fall (see Illustration 3).andP;  These gateways provide two primarybenefits.andP;  By offering complete read/write access to data, they enhance thedeveloper's ability to port applications from one database to another.andP;  Someof the caveats here are obvious, since Progress supports functionality thatOracle and RMS do not.andP;  A classic example is Oracle's lack of support for&quot;find previous&quot;.andP;  The documentation for the gateways is very clear on thesedifferences in function.andM;The gateways also enhance the power and flexibility of Progress's distributeddatabase.andP;  We have long maintained that this will be a major part of thedemand for distributed database, and that the successful vendors will bethose recognizing the need to connect to competitive DBMS products.andM;Progress can perform distributed queries (joins) across all three types ofdata--Progress, Oracle, and RMS.andP;  Heterogeneous distributed updates are muchmore difficult to implement because neither Oracle nor RMS understand theconcept of a two-phase commit.andP;  Progress allows Oracle and RMS data toparticipate in multidatabase update transactions to the extent possible, andclearly documents the risks involved in doing so.andP;  Since it is currentlyimpossible to implement a complete two-phase commit across theseheterogeneous data managers, the company's objective is to at leastdramatically reduce the window of potential failure.andP;  If something does failduring this very short window, data can be lost, since Progress cannot extendits crash recovery procedures to Oracle or RMS data.andM;To access a foreign database, you first create a Progress database as the&quot;schema-holder&quot; for the non-Progress database.andP;  This describes the schema(tables and fields) of the foreign database.andP;  The DBA can set up theschema-holder or can invoke a utility that examines the foreign schema andconfigures the Progress version.andP;  Progress also provides integration withDigital's Common Data Dictionary to obtain RMS/Rdb schema information.andP;  TheDBA can then enhance the schema using Progress data dictionary functions,such as adding table and field validation criteria, help messages, etc.andM;The Oracle gateway is a joint marketing and technical cooperation effort.andO;Our guess is that this was prompted by Oracle's need, particularly in theUnix environment, for a strong 4GL in order to compete with products likeInformix.andM;New Data Dictionary.andP;  The Data Dictionary function has been rewritten with anew interface (strip and pull-down menus); new options to support multiple,alternative, and distributed databases; and many other additions.andM;SQL Additions.andP;  Embedded SQL is now available for C, Cobol, and Pascal in theProgress Host Language Interface (HLI) products.andP;  The HLI for C also supportsdynamic embedded SQL, letting C programmers create dynamic SQL statements atruntime.andM;The addition of a dynamic SQL interface will allow developers of other tools(e.g., spreadsheets, CASE, word processing) to more easily access Progressdatabases as well.andM;X Window Support.andP;  Progress applications can now run under popular graphicaluser interfaces (GUIs) such as those built atop X Window (OSF/Motif, OpenLook, Open Desktop, DECwindows), and OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM).andO;However, support for GUIs is still very limited.andP;  While Progress now runs ina window, it still looks like a character interface.andP;  Full GUI support willcome with Version 7 (see &quot;Futures&quot; below).andM;PACKAGING.andP;  Progress Software maintains a relative simplicity of packaging inrefreshing contrast to many of its competitors.andP;  The RDBMS and 4GL arepackaged together as a single product.andP;  The only subsets of Progressavailable are run-time versions aimed at helping the professional developerdeploy applications (see Illustration 4).andP;  For example, with ProgressQuery/Report, the end user can develop new applications (i.e., new queriesand reports) but cannot modity the database structure or the data.andP;  Thisoffers a nice middle ground for VARs, enabling them to give customers notonly a custom-developed application, but also ad hoc development flexibilityat a lower cost (and risk) than providing a complete version of Progress.andO;All versions of Progress include heterogeneous networking support.andM;Another set of tools to assist the developer in packaging and distributingapplications is the Developer's Toolkit.andP;  The Toolkit now generates encryptedsource code (unreadable and uncompiled), and every run-time version ofProgress includes an encrypted source code compiler (with no decryptionalgorithm).andP;  Thus, the developer buys the Toolkit only for the platform onwhich an application is developed, not for every platform on which theapplication will be deployed.andP;  This is a tremendous plus for the developer interms of reduced cost and easier deployment.andM;PLATFORMS.andP;  Progress is written in C and was developed in the 68000-basedUnix environment.andP;  In addition to a wide variety of Unix platforms, it alsoruns on DOS, OS/2, Digital's VMS, Unisys BTOS/CTOS, and LANs (seeIllustration 5).andM;Early availability on the PC AT (1985) provided a significant advantage forProgress developers.andP;  They could create a Progress application in asingle-user DOS environment and then easily port it to other platforms,including multiuser systems.andP;  Unlike some of the competition, Progress on DOSruns within the standard 640K of memory, another strong selling point.andM;MARKETING STRATEGY.andP;  Progress is marketed primarily through value-addedresellers (VARs), and the company now has 1,200 VARs worldwide.andP;  The companyalso sells directly to corporate MIS professionals and government agencies.andO;Currently, 60 percent of the company's revenues are from VARs and 40 percentfrom end users.andM;Progress is well aware of the need to increase its name recognition vis a vismuch larger and better-known competitors like Oracle and Informix.andP;  Sellingprimarily to VARs can often mean that the VAR and its application have a muchhigher profile than does Progress as the underlying platform.andP;  VARs will alsobenefit from better visibility for Progress since they often find themselvesin direct competition with Oracle et al.andP;  for business.andM;In a recent reorganization, Progress established a separate marketing groupand plans to gear up its efforts.andP;  The overall strategy is to move into abroader market, increasing penetration in the corporate MIS arena whilemaintaining a strong VAR program.andP;  The company feels that it now has thecritical mass necessary to focus on both channels, and will increase both thedirect sales force and required support groups.andP;  Areas the company intends toadvertise more are its technology for delivering deployed applications (anissue for large users as well as VARs), its database architecture and supportfor heterogeneous distributed network computing, its strong positioning inboth Unix and VMS, and the breadth of VAR applications available.andP;  Futureaccess to DB2 and availability on the AS/400 will also appeal to the Fortune1000.andM;Progress provides consulting services, and expects this aspect of thebusiness to grow.andP;  One arena Progress will not enter is the applicationsbusiness.andP;  The company has no desire to follow in Oracle's footsteps and endup competing with its own VARs.andM;Installed Base.andP;  The company states that over 40,000 copies of Progress arein use, with over 220,000 users.andM;The Competition.andP;  Progress started on the Unix platform and continues to haveits greatest strength here.andP;  The company sees positive developments for theUnix market as acceptance in the United States grows and as the platformsimprove (e.g., IBM's RS6000).andP;  Progress competes most frequently withInformix in head-to-head comparisons of features and function.andP;  Oracle isalso a strong competitor, since it is so large and well known.andM;Digital's VAX/VMS environment is newer for Progress, and the company hasfocused its marketing on VARs rather than trying to get VMS shops to switchto Progress.andP;  However, it is starting to see growing interest from usercompanies.andP;  Progress also feels that Version 6 positions it well for theentire Digital environment: The gateways to Oracle, RMS, and Rdb cover amajority of installed VMS databases, Progress runs on all of Digital'splatforms (VMS, Ultrix, and DOS), and strong networking support fits wellwith Digital's emphasis in this area.andM;DOS is not currently a major database platform for Progress, and the companysells more to organizations looking to deploy applications developed on thePC into multiuser environments.andP;  However, emphasis on DOS as a clientplatform is growing, and Progress is packaging its DOS client/server softwareto appeal to this market.andP;  The company also offers both client and serversoftware for OS/2 and will sharpen its focus here as demand dictates.andO;Increased market visibility will become particularly important if Progressintends to compete more directly on the DOS and OS/2 platforms.andM;The CTOS/BTOS environment is still very pervasive in certain areas,particularly government agencies such as the Coast Guard.andP;  Progress isprobably the leading applications development platform here.andM;Using ProgressandM;We evaluated Progress Version 6.2A on a Sun 4/60 under OpenWindows.andP;  Progressis virtually identical in all of its operating environments.andP;  Theaccompanying chart provides a summary of Progress's features and functions(see page 12).andM;The Unix version requires a minimum of 2MB of memory for the server/operatingsystem/shared memory, plus a maximum of .5MB for each user.andP;  (In a run-timeenvironment, there can be at least three users per MB of shared memory.)andM;Progress uses a variable length format to store the information in eachfield, optimizing the use of storage space.andP;  Maximum record size increasedfrom 2K to 32K with Version 6.andM;In this section, we will describe what it is like to work with the standardProgress 4GL/DBMS product.andP;  Then we will cover the Fast Track applicationdevelopment system and provide a sneak preview of a soon-to-be-introducedend-user product.andM;USER INTERFACE.andP;  In the Progress environment, the procedure editor is &quot;homebase,&quot; so to speak.andP;  You start in the procedure editor, and use it to accesseverything in Progress (including the data dictionary).andP;  Once a database isdefined using the data dictionary, all other Progress functions andoperations are done by entering statements in the procedure editor andrunning the procedure.andP;  This includes adding, updating, and deleting records,querying the database, and generating reports, as well as developing complexapplications.andM;The Procedure Editor.andP;  The procedure editor is fully integrated with the datadictionary and the language compiler.andP;  It verifies the existence of tablesand fields and checks your syntax.andP;  One of the best features of the procedureeditor is its level of interaction with the user.andP;  If you make an error, itpositions the cursor over the error and provides an error message.andP;  At thispoint, you can correct the error and immediately rerun the procedure.andP;  Youcan move, delete, and copy text within a single procedure or betweenprocedures.andP;  There is also a global search and replace function.andM;Progress is flexible in creating procedures.andP;  Procedures are stored as ASCIIfiles and can be written using other editors.andP;  Statements within procedurescan take up more than one line.andP;  The only requirement is that the entirestatement end with a period (as if you were writing sentences).andP;  As do mostprocedural languages, Progress recommends that you indent nested statementsand loops within procedures.andP;  This formatting convention makes procedureseasier to read and understand.andP;  A nice touch is the fact that when you indenta line in a procedure, Progress continues to indent subsequent lines untilyou manually move to a different margin.andM;Help.andP;  From the end-user perspective, we were disappointed that the helpfunction remains unchanged since our last review (the only addition is accessto a new procedure library).andP;  Help is not context sensitive, it is not ashelpful as we would like, and there is no online help for the data dictionaryfunction.andM;Help is a fixed menu of items from which you choose what you want to know.andO;It is designed primarily for assisting in the procedure debugging process.andM;Documentation.andP;  Version 6 documentation has been redesigned.andP;  It consists ofseveral manuals that come packaged with a desktop &quot;bookcase&quot; or frame inwhich to neatly store them.andM;The manuals are clear and well-written, including the Programming Handbook,even from the end-user perspective.andP;  They are full of examples and make gooduse of graphics.andP;  The writing style is straightforward and does an excellentjob of explaining terms and why Progress does something the way it does.andM;Since Progress looks the same on all systems, the documentation includesinstructions for all environments: Unix, DOS, VAX/VMS, and CTOS/BTOS,providing helpful hints about each operating system.andP;  There is just oneversion of the documentation no matter what system you have.andP;  Thedocumentation also provides helpful hints about each operating system.andM;CREATING A DATABASE.andP;  Version 6 allows multiple databases to be connectedconcurrently, so you can create a database from within the Progress datadictionary.andP;  Previously, you had to do this at the Unix prompt beforeentering Progress.andP;  Then, if you wanted to create or use another database,you had to actually exit Progress and restart it with a different databasename.andP;  We found this counter-intuitive, since the database became the&quot;umbrella&quot; under which the user worked rather than the Progress environmentitself.andP;  This is reversed with Version 6, and it makes much more sense, notto mention the additional flexibility it provides.andM;Data Dictionary.andP;  The Progress data dictionary, itself a Progress applicationwritten in the 4GL, is menu driven (see Illustration 6).andP;  It stores allinformation about the distributed database environment, including thestructure, type, location, access method, and access restrictions for eachdatabase.andP;  You create, modify, and delete databases, tables, fields, andindexes by selecting menu items and completing screen forms.andP;  Progress hasdone a nice job of structuring these menus and screens.andP;  We found the processrelatively intuitive and easy to work with.andP;  We especially like the fact thatProgress has made defining tables and fields comprehensive and yet notoverwhelming.andM;One criticism we have of the Progress user interface is that there are minordifferences in the way menus have been implemented in the data dictionary,help, and Fast Track modules.andP;  This isn't a big problem, but cleaning theseup will enhance the product's consistency.andM;Tables.andP;  For each table, you can enter a validation expression, which is alogical expression that must be true before Progress will delete a recordfrom the file (see Illustration 7).andP;  An example of a validation test would bedisallowing the deletion of a customer master record if there are stilloutstanding orders for the customer.andM;More complex validation criteria can be created in an &quot;include&quot; file, whichis then referenced as the validation expression.andP;  Thus Progress allows you todefine a level of referential integrity in the data dictionary rather thandepending on the competence and thoroughness of the developer to preservereferential integrity.andP;  This is an important factor in increasing developerproductivity and preserving database integrity.andP;  Progress cannot, however,cascade referential integrity checks across multiple tables automatically.andO;This will come with the implementation of triggers in Version 7.andM;Fields.andP;  The only required information for a field is its name and datatype.andO;You do not have to indicate a field length because Progress stores the datain each field as a variable length.andP;  Progress supports five datatypes:character, integer, decimal, logical, and date.andP;  Progress fills in defaultvalues for the remaining field characteristics and allows you to change themif you want.andP;  Null values and arrays of any datatype are supported.andP;  (SeeIllustration 8 for other field attributes.)andP;  We would have liked moreinformation and examples on creating field validation expressions,particularly those where you validate ehe existence of data in another table.andM;Modifying the Structure.andP;  Progress allows you to change the tablespecifications (such as validation test and message) as well as the tablename, and to delete tables.andM;You can add, delete, and modify fields in a table.andP;  None of thesemodifications requires the user to unload the data first and load it back inafter the database is modified.andP;  The only things you cannot change are thedatatype or array extent of a field.andP;  Doing either requires creating a newfield, copying the data into the new field, and deleting the old field.andM;Only one person can change the data dictionary at one time, and, on amultiuser system, you can't change tables that are in use by either a user ora running procedure.andM;DESIGNING FORMS.andP;  Progress uses &quot;frames,&quot; or windows, to display data, andautomatically provides a default frame format if one isn't specified.andP;  To dothis, Progress follows a comprehensive and well-documented set of defaultoptions.andP;  It is also possible to define custom frames within a procedure.andO;You can specify overall frame characteristics as well as those that affectindividual fields in the display (with the ability to override or augmentdata dictionary definitions).andP;  Screen forms can contain multiple frames(windows) and frames can be hidden or overlaid on others (see Illustration9).andP;  Progress also supports color and other video attributes.andM;Using the &quot;form&quot; statement is helpful if you want to use the frame repeatedlyin one or more procedures.andP;  The form statement defines the frame and namesit.andP;  The procedure can then invoke the frame definition whenever appropriate.andO;This is akin to the standard forms-design process in other DBMSs, where youdesign an specific form, store it, and call it up when needed.andP;  Forms canalso be designed using the Fast Track screen painter.andM;ENTERING DATA.andP;  To add, update, and delete records in a database, you use theappropriate Progress commands (insert, update, and delete) in the procedureeditor.andM;When entering data in a new record, Progress does not always validate a fieldentry as you leave the field.andP;  It may wait untilyou are done with the recordand then go back to invalid field entries.andP;  We would rather get immediatefeedback that the entry doesn't meet the validation test.andM;Using the Fast Track query-by-forms function, you can further automate thedata entry and editing processes by defining a form and an associated stripmenu for add, update, and delete.andM;INDEXING.andP;  It is easy to create indexes with the index editor in the datadictionary.andP;  Options include specifying whether an index is primary and/orunique, and the fields on which to build the index.andM;Progress uses B-tree indexing and allows indexing on up to 16 fields.andP;  Youcan change the name of an index and delete it.andP;  You cannot change thecomponents of an index once it is created; you have to create a new index.andM;Once you define an index, Progress uses it automatically, selecting the mostefficient path to the data.andM;QUERIES.andP;  Progress queries are generated from procedures that generally usethe &quot;for each&quot; and &quot;display&quot; statements.andP;  For example,andM;for each customer where curr-balandgt;=1400: display name phone curr-balsales-rep.andP;  end.andM;We found it very easy in Progress to relate tables and display related dataon the screen.andP;  Displaying information from three files (e.g., line iteminformation for each order for each customer) in three separate windows tookonly a couple of minutes to generate and refine.andP;  And no forms design wasnecessary, although the display could easily have been spruced up.andP;  It ismind-boggling to imagine doing the same thing with SQL and some otherforms-design products we have used.andM;We could not find a way to display aggreates (e.g., totals) without listingall the fields we wanted to see.andP;  We also could not go backward throughrecords retrieved by a Progress query (a page-up function to go back to theprevious record).andP;  The only way to see previous records is to rerun thequery.andP;  Query-by-forms in Fast Track resolves both of these issues.andM;REPORTS.andP;  A report in Progress is simply another query with control breaks,aggregates, and fancier formatting.andP;  As the report gets more complex andcustomized, so does the procedure required.andP;  If you want to override theProgress default layouts, you are into specifying column and row positions.andO;Fast Track provides an easier-to-use WYSIWYG report writer.andM;APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT.andP;  The tutorial documentation on writing proceduresis excellent, explaining in detail what is actually happening in the databaseas each statement in a procedure executes.andP;  Progress automatically compiles aprocedure before running it for the first time, and procedures can be nested.andO;The tutorial describes this process, explaining how to set up subproceduresand include files, and how to pass data and arguments among procedures tobuild flexibility into an application.andP;  The documentation also covers puttingthe &quot;finishing touches&quot; on an application, such as providingcontext-sensitive help and preparing the application for use.andM;While Progress is not really an end-user development tool for the averageuser, there is an elegance and ease surrounding much of the Progressfunctionality that is impressive.andP;  Much of this has to do with the closeintegration of the procedure editor and the data dictionary, the interactivenature of the procedure editor, and the fact that Progress essentiallyprovides a single environment to work in.andP;  Unfortunately, some basicdevelopment steps, such as creating an application menu, require writing whatlooks like a relatively complex set of procedures.andP;  Yet other functions thatappear to be complex, such s relating three files and displaying informationfrom each in multiple windows on a single screen, are incredibly easy.andP;  Youdon't even need to design a custom form to get meaningful results inProgress.andP;  The default formats are often quite serviceable.andM;Fast Track provides a more automated tool for generating applications,dramatically improving the accessibility of Progresshs power andfunctionality for the end user.andP;  The coming end-user tools go even further inproviding easy access to data.andM;DATA INTEGRITY.andP;  One of the real strengths of Progress is its data integrityfacilities.andP;  You can include data validation and referential integrity in thedata dictionary; Progress provides automatic crash recovery and supports rollforward recovery.andP;  The company state that crash recovery has always been animportant feature of Progress because it uses variable record lengths.andM;SECURITY.andP;  In the Progress data dictionary, you define user IDs and passwordsto ensure that only authorized users can access the database.andP;  You can alsospecify separate read, write, create, and delete permissions at the table andfield level.andP;  Restricting access to specific records in a table can only beaccomplished with a procedure.andM;Within an application, the developer can create an &quot;activities permission&quot;file, a table listing each procedure and the names of users authorized to runthe procedure.andP;  Security can also be built in the operating system level inUnix (and VMS) for databases ad object code.andM;Fast TrackandM;Fast Track is a comprehensive, menu-driven, applications builder layered ontop of Progress.andP;  Introduced in late 1988, it is designed as a productivitytool, speeding the development of applications for both developers andexperienced end users.andP;  Fast Track, itself an application written in the 4GL,includes a menu editor, screen paitner (for creating forms), report writer,and query-by-forms (QBF) generator (see Illustration 10).andP;  Once a database iscreated (using the Progress data dictionary), the developer can design menus,screen forms, reports, and QBF access to the data without having to use the4GL.andP;  The result can be a complete application, or it can provide modules ofa more complex application.andM;Fast Track automatically generates standardized and optimized Progress 4GLcode.andP;  The application can be modified within Fast Track, or the code can beedit directly using the Progress 4GL Editor.andP;  Fast Track is self-documenting,including comments in the code it generates.andM;One of the most attractive aspects of Fast Track is its flexibility.andP;  You candesign an application from the top down, creating a menu structure and thendefining the underlying processes (reports, data entry forms, etc.) invokedwhen a menu choice is made.andP;  Or you can first design the individual piecesand then integrate these into the menu structure.andP;  Fast Track has beedesigned to easily incorporate procedures written inthe Progress 4GL.andP;  Thus,an application initially generated with Fast Track and customized furtherwith 4GL procedures can be modified within Fast Track without &quot;clobbering&quot;the embedded procedures.andM;Other appealing features are the WYSIWYG Approach to developing menus, forms,and reports; consistency in the use of function keys and commands; and theease with which the developer can view objects on the screen exactly as theywill be displayed in the application.andM;While Fast Track cannot completely handle all aspects of a complexapplication, it can greatly improve productivity in designing menus, forms,and reports while allowing the developer to incorporate procedures written inthe 4GL.andP;  Fast Track is also a good tool for prototyping applications.andM;FUTURES.andP;  Future plans include extending Fast Track to handle as much of anapplication as possible, reducing the need to write 4GL code.andP;  Progress isalso aware that is developers build tools (e.g., menu generators) as well asapplications.andP;  In an efort to tap this talen and to allow the developer tocontinue to use familiar tools, and company intends to make Fast Track bothmodular and tailorable.andP;  It will provide a framework and library facilitiesso the developer can mix and match Progress-developed modules with otherdevelopment tools of choice.andM;It is not clear whether Fast Track will ever become a full-fledged CASEdevelopment tool, although the company is moving somewhat in that direction.andO;Its current strategy is to encourage third-party development of bridges toexisting CASE offerings rather than direct competition.andP;  Examples will beconnections to both Knowledge Ware and Index CASE products.andM;End-User ToolsandM;Progress is getting ready to introduce its first end-user data access productlater this fall.andP;  We had the opportunity to see a pre-beta-test version andliked several aspects of the product (as yet unnamed).andP;  Our initialimpression is that Progress has done its homework in assessing what the enduser wants, at least in terms of data access.andP;  The next step is to provideend-user development tools.andP;  The company acknowledges the need for these inthe future, but feels that the user still really wants a professionaldeveloper to do application development unless the application is verysimple.andM;The company has worked hard to make the end-user product easy to use,reasonably powerful, and well-integrated with other Progress modules.andO;Designed as a set of data access tools, it is complementary to existingdevelopment tools rather than an application development tool itself.andP;  Itsupports both the 4GL and Fast Track, generating 4GL code that can bemodified by both.andM;The interface is menu driven and consistent with Progress and Fast Track inthe use of function keys.andP;  Modules include query, reports, labels, dataexport, system administration, plus a &quot;user&quot; menu option for accessing customtools and utilities.andM;A primary objective is to maintain context for the user, keeping the userfrom getting lost in either the tool or the database.andP;  The product builds itsown default interface based on the existing database schema and userpermissions.andP;  It carries as much context as possible as the user movesbetween modules (e.g., from query to reports) or to the &quot;user&quot; menu.andP;  Thehelp function will also be context sensitive.andM;QUERIES.andP;  The query facility is forms based and offers either a QBF or QBE(query by example) approach.andP;  The user can choose from a list of availablequery forms, and each form has an associated list of tables from which itdisplays data.andP;  The forms themselves must be created in the 4GL or FastTrack.andP;  Table relationships (joins) are defined in Fast Track, by the systemadministrator, or by the end user.andM;The user has options to enter a query by example (which only supports the&quot;and&quot; operator, as is typical) or more complex query criteria by creating a&quot;where&quot; clause (you simply select &quot;where&quot; from the query menu and fill in theforms on the screen via point and pick).andP;  The user can also edit the querystatement directly.andP;  With permission, the user can access menu options foradd, update, and delete.andM;REPORTS.andP;  The report module is very easy and intuitive.andP;  You simply pickfields from a list and number them to indicate their order on the report.andO;The fields are displayed in a WYSIWYG layout window as they will appear inthe report.andP;  You can rearrange the fields by renumbering them (the followingfields are automatically renumbered); create totals, subtotals, runningtotals, percents, And counters; use an expression-builder to createcalculated fields; include fields from up to five tables; order on up to fivefields and suppress duplicate values; define formats, labels, column spacing,and header justification.andM;Progress plans to provide direct access to Fast Track so that reportsdesigned in the end-user product can be easily moved to Fast Track andenhanced.andM;LABELS.andP;  A nifty label generator will try to automatically select theappropriate label fields (e.g., name, address, city, etc.) if requested.andP;  Theadministrator can provide a sample list of field names to help this process.andO;The user can modify the selected fields and define several parameters: omitblank lines, number of copies, number of labels across, total height, etc.andM;The Developer'sandM;PerspectiveandM;We also discussed Progress with five developers to get their assessment ofthe strengths and weaknesses of the product.andP;  All have extensive experiencewith Progress, having used it for two to five years.andP;  Three developers areusing Progress for internal development, and two are VARs.andM;STRENGTHS.andP;  All of the developers are very pleased with Progress.andP;  Threemajor strenghts were cited across the board, and everyone had additionalpositives to report.andM;Applications Development.andP;  Everyone stressed the ease and speed of developingand prototyping applications.andP;  The 4GL is also a complete langhuage; none ofthe developers have had to resort to 3GL to complete an application.andP;  &quot;Evenwhen you think you're stuck, you can usually finda a way around the problem.&quot;andO;(The only exception was storing and manipulating text blobs--see &quot;OtherWeaknesses&quot; below).andM;One internal developer now has 600 Progress applications in place and statesthat the product has greatly improved productivity.andP;  Other positive commentsincluded the conciseness of the language and the ability to build your owndevelopment tools using Progress.andM;Another developer likes the flexibility Progress provides in designingapplications.andP;  Examples are the ability to design real-time screens (updatedevery second) and custom interfaces, and strong screen-mapping capabilities.andM;Integrity.andP;  All five developers cited Progress's data integrity capabilities;none has had any problems in this important area.andP;  One developer has &quot;neverlost data in five years.&quot;andM;Database Architecture.andP;  Progress's support forboth distributed andheterogeneous databases was mentioned by everyone as providing significantnew opportunities in the kinds of applications that can be developed.andP;  Onedeveloper stressed the ability to now compete in areas it couldn'tpreviously, such as developing a centralized order processing system thatplaces demands on multiple remote manufacturing sites, or a system in whichremote sales offices place cemands on a central manufacturing site.andO;Multiple/distributed database access is critical to these types ofapplications.andM;One VAR plans to port Progress applications to Oracle in particular.andP;  ThisVAR sees access to Oracle as greatly enhancing its competitive position invertical markets where Oracle is weak, such as complex manufacturing systems.andM;Another real benefit of distributed database is in providing both growthpaths and performance enhancements.andP;  A developer can easily distribute adatabase among multiple machines if the application outgrows one platform.andO;One developer also improved performance of an application by converting it(without having to modify the application) to a distributed database acrossthree machines.andP;  Another developer has worked extensively with Progress'sdistributed databased capabilities and states that it &quot;works and works well,including the two-phase commit.&quot;andM;Portability.andP;  Three developers see Progress's high level of portabilityacross a variety of platforms as a major benefit.andP;  Applications can bedeveloped on one platform and ported to another simply by recompiling code.andO;This facilities deployment of applications and provides flexibility inchoosing platforms.andM;Quality.andP;  Three developers describe Progress as a very quality-orientedcompany.andP;  Products are not delivered unless they are truly ready for primetime, an important issue for both internal developers and VARs.andM;Support.andP;  Developers complimented the company on its responsiveness to itsusers (&quot;they listen to us&quot;) and on &quot;dependable, knowledgeable&quot; technicalsupport.andM;Two developers also mentioned the clarity and completeness of thedocumentation as a strength.andM;Other Strengths.andP;  Other strengths included Progress's low cost, minimalmemory requirement per user (1/3 to 1/2MB), and its strong VAR program.andM;WEAKNESSES.andP;  None of the developers had any major negatives with respect toProgress, and no single area of improvement was mentioned by all five.andM;Size of Company.andP;  In general, the developers are concerned about the lack ofmarket visibility for Progress.andP;  One developer stated that, although thecompany has capabilities some competitors are still only promising (e.g.,andO;distributed database, client/server), it doesn't stress this enough.andP;  Theconsensus is that the company is too conservative in its advertising andneeds to do more to compete with Oracle, Ingres, Sybase, and Informix.andP;  &quot;Thetendency not to overpromise can enhance credibility at the expense ofvisibility.&quot;andP;  One VAR described Progress as &quot;second-tier in terms ofrecognition and sales, although the product itself warrants placement in thetop tier&quot; in terms of capabilities.andM;One developer raised a related issue--the need for a more global presence inAsia and the Pacific.andP;  Kanji support, for example, is essential for largeglobal companies; Progress needs to incorporate this to develop a trulyworldwide presence.andM;GUI.andP;  Support for graphical user interfaces is becoming important; thedevelopers see this as a requirement for future success.andM;End-User Requirements.andP;  Lack of a good set of end-user tools for query andreport writing was a negative for two developers.andP;  (These tools will beavailable shortly.)andP;  Another potential solution in this area is theconnection of user-friendly tools to Progress via dynamic SQL.andM;Support.andP;  In spite of the overall satisfaction with support, a few problemsand cautionary points were raised.andP;  One developer experienced some seriousproblems with Progress when upgrading to a new release of the operatingsystem on one platform.andP;  He described Progress as tending to have a &quot;fly andfix&quot; mentality here (you fly it, we'll fix it).andP;  The company needs to be onthe leading edge in this area and to work more closely with major hardwarevendors.andM;One developer wants better tools for monitoring database activities andtuning the system.andP;  Another was concerned that the heterogeneous databasegateways may cause some support problems because they essentially create amultivendor environment.andP;  &quot;It is unclear how much this will stretchProgress's support resources.&quot;andM;Another developer doesn't feel that Progress adequately documents &quot;tricks andtraps&quot; necessary to more effectively use the language (e.g., definition ofrecord-scoping, why it is relevant, and where it is useful).andP;  Progress alsoneeds to make the examples in the documentation consistent in terms of coding(e.g., shared lock vs.andP;  no lock).andM;Default Locking.andP;  Two developers were critical of the fact that Progress usesshared locks as the default locking environment.andP;  This can create problems(and blow up lock tables) if the developer is not careful on multiusersystems.andP;  One mentioned the fact that the documentation doesn't adequatelyexplain this situation.andP;  The addition of a startup parameter to change thedefault to &quot;no lock&quot; will help here.andM;Other Weaknesses.andP;  One developer wants to see enforcement of all of thevalidation rules in the database and support for primary/foreign keys (comingwith Version 7).andP;  This becomes increasingly important as companies movetoward distributing the applications development process as well as thedatabase.andP;  Another developer wants support for large text and image blobs.andO;The database should be able to store large chunks of text and allow editingwithing the database.andM;FuturesandM;We have already described enhancements planned for layered products, such asthe extension of Fast Track and the introduction of end-user tools.andP;  Otherdevelopments in key areas will be introduced in future versions of the4GL/RDBMS.andM;EXTENSIBLE DATATYPES.andP;  Support for multimedia datatypes and peripherals iscoming for Progress.andP;  The developer will be able to define completely newdatatypes by writing C programs (drivers) to describe the necessary formatsfor I/O, calculation, sorting, storage, and export, as well as functions thatcan be performed on the datatype.andP;  Progress sees two primary markets for thiscapability: third parties who want to provide tools for the Progressapplication developer, and hardware manufacturers who want Progress to bettersupport their platforms.andM;Another planned addition to the data dictionary is support for what Progresscalls domains, or user-defined datatypes.andP;  Here, the user takes a standardProgress datatype and extends it to include parameters that currently must bedefined for each instance of the datatype.andP;  For example, you could define a&quot;currency&quot; datatype as a decimal datatype with a format of $andgt;andgt;,andgt;andgt;9.99.andP;  Ifyou then enter &quot;currency&quot; as the datatype for any new field, the new fieldwill take on these attributes.andP;  User-defined datatypes simplify maintenance,support relationships among data, and promote consistency among applications.andM;TRIGGERS.andP;  Adding triggers to Progress will greatly enhance its appeal to thedeveloper.andP;  The company will predefine categories of events that can havetriggers attached to them--database events (e.g., create, update, or deleterecord) and user interface events (e.g., enter or exit field).andP;  Triggers willbe written in the 4GL and then stored and executed either in the application(on the client side) or on the server.andP;  This is different from triggers asimplemented by Sybase, since Sybase triggers are always stored and executedon the server.andM;Triggers can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including cascadingreferential integrity, record-level security, and complex validation logic.andM;GATEWAYS.andP;  Progress plans to add other DBMS gateways to enhance the migrationpath it provides for the user.andP;  Under consideration are Informix/C-ISAM,Ingres, Sybase, and IBM's DB2.andP;  In the case of DB2, Progress is looking towork with a partner that has already invested in a DB2 connection.andM;Progress would also like to open the development of gateways to thirdparties.andP;  Providing an &quot;open&quot; gateway interface is more a matter ofdocumentation and packaging than development.andP;  Extending gateways in thisdirection also means grappling with new support and quality control issues.andM;SQL.andP;  Version 7 will features a complete implementation of ANSI Level 2 SQL(e.g., union, support for primary and foreign keys, etc.).andM;PERFORMANCE.andP;  Progress will continue to enhance performance--refining andpublishing TP/1 and other benchmarks, and increasing the number of users andthe size of the database supported.andM;WINDOWS.andP;  A major effort for the company is full support forindustry-standard graphical user interfaces at two primary levels.andP;  Progressmust take advantage of the appropriate window manager toolkits (Motif,Presentation Manager, et al.) to get its own real GUI.andP;  This includes theability to launch multiple windows from within Progress and to have multipleframes active at the same time.andP;  The company must also provide tools thatallow the developer to easily add a graphical interface to Progressapplications.andM;Two major objectives for Progress in supporting GUIs are to providepresentation independence (so the application can adapt transparently to thenative GUI regardless of the development or run-time platform), and supportfor character-based terminals.andP;  The ability to effectively run an applicationdesigned for a GUI on a character-based terminal without modification is veryimportant.andP;  Developers will not want to use different tools to writeapplications for terminals and workstations, or to have to write anapplication twice to accommodate both.andM;Progress does not yet support a native Macintosh interface and sees supportfor GUIs in Version 7 as the logical point at which to do this.andM;OTHER ENHANCEMENTS.andP;  Other potential developments include the ability toperform full-text searches within fields; tools, such as a comprehensivedebugger, a performance profiler, system tuning tools, and a preprocessor;support for Progress as a Network Loadable Module (NLM) for Novell's PortableNetWare; and extensive enhancements to multilingual capabilities (such asKanji support).andP;  We also expect to see Progress taking advantage of emergingnew technologies such as object orientation.andM;ConclusionandM;Progres has a lot going for it--a strong RDBMS, comprehensive development anddeployment tools, happy developers, and a broad range of availableapplications.andP;  (Hewlett-Packard's OpenMFG MRP II offering is a Progress VARapplication.)andP;  The company is right on target with its emphasis ondistributed network computing support.andM;The major negative for Progress is lack of market visibility for tboth thecompany and the product.andP;  And waiting too long or moving too slowly to fixthis problem may mean missing a critical window of opportunity.andP;  Theselection of a DBMS is becoming a strategic decision for many organizations,and the competition is fierce.andP;  The customer is more savvy and is looking forvendors who can back up marketing promises with real products that solve realbusiness problems.andP;  The RDBMS is getting more complex, and subtleties in howor to what extent a particular feature or function is implemented can getlost in the marketing noise.andM;Progress has worked hard to position itself well technically, filling someimportant gaps with support for heterogeneous distributed databases and SQL.andO;Now it needs to carefully plan and implement a marketing strategy that willenable it to effetively differentiate its offering.andM;Another concern is how fast the company can grow and still keep everythingunder control in terms of product quality and effective support.andP;  A thirdrequirement for success is an on-going development process to ensure that theproduct continues to meet market demands.andP;  Here, Progress needs to focus onareas we have already discussed: enhancements such as triggers and extensibledatatypes, performance improvements, more gateways, and support for windowingenvironments.andM;Progress Software again has an impressivley full plate in front of it.andP;  Thepressure this time is as much on the sales and marketing folks as it is onthose developing advanced technology.andP;  The company is clearly aware of thechallenges ahead and appears ready to tackle them with enthusiams.andP;  Thiscould make the RDBMS market even more interesting than it already is.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
