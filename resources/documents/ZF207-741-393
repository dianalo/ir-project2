with20MEI hard disk, $3,799; with 40MB hard disk, $4,199; with monochromemonitor, DOS 3.31, $4,574; with VGA monitor, $5,018; with 40MB tape backup,1.2MB 5-1/4-inch and 1.44MB 3-1/2-inch floppy disk drives, $6,092.andM;In Short: the Compaq Deskpro 386S is one of the most expensive computers inits category, even though its performance is in general unimpressive.andP;  Thesefactors are somewhat counterbalanced by the quality of the design andconstruction.andP;  For example, all the basic VO functions, such as video,serial, and parallel parts and the floppy/hard disk controller are builtright onto the motherboard.andM;The Compaq Deskpro 386S takes a lot of liberties with the price/performanceequation.andP;  With a base price of $3,299 and a VGA system cost of $5,018, theDeskpro 386S rides very near the top of the cost curve.andP;  Yet its processor,memory, and hard disk performance are undistinguished.andP;  Stretching theequation in these two directions at once doesn't make this Compaq machinelook like a smart buy.andP;  But these numbers lose some of their significancewhen you add in the intangibles: Compaq's superior quality of construction,the efficiency of its design, and its reputation for service.andM;A close look at the Compaq's performance on our benchmark tests reveals amachine that operates at both ends of the spectrum.andP;  The processor turned insome of the slowest times.andP;  The conventional memory performance was theslowest of all, yet the extended memory proved to be the fastest.andP;  The harddisk performance was a little better than average.andP;  But when it came to ourvideo tests, the Deskpro 386S was always among the top three.andP;  The superfastvideo may compensate for the slow processor, but the combination ofcomparatively slow conventional memory, hard disk, and processor is likely tobe perceptible to the user.andM;Computers cannot be judged solely on operational performance and price.andP;  Thequality of the construction, the longevity of components, the machine'sexpansion capabilities, and the available service must also be considered.andO;In all of these respects Compaq's 386S computer stands out.andM;Getting inside the computer is easy.andP;  There are only three thumbscrewsholding the case to the chassis, which are easily unscrewed by hand once youget them started.andP;  Because they stay attached to the rear panel, you don'thave to worry about dropping them into the machine or losing them.andP;  Thescrews that hold the plates covering the expansion slots, however, areanother story.andP;  They are Torx screws, so you need a special screwdriver toremove them--not necessarily a common item to have lying around.andM;The computer's chassis is supported front to back by the metal case of the140-watt power supply, which runs the entire depth of the machine.andP;  The smallfootprint--5.9 by 15.8 by 14.8 inches (HWD)--means that there is less play inthe frame, motherboard, and case.andP;  The four drive bays are encased in asturdy metal shell to protect them further.andM;There are only five expansion slots in the 386S.andP;  They all the take 16-bitcards, but one of them is a proprietary high-speed slot reserved for memoryexpansion.andP;  The Desktop 386S have two high-speed memory cards, one with 1MBRAM and the other with 4MB, to which you can add 1MB or 4MB memory modules.andO;When you add these to the 1MB of 80-nanosecond RAM on the motherboard, themost memory you can swing is 13MB.andM;The system memory comes in either of two configurations: eight4-by-256-kilobit chips with four 1-by-256-kilobit chips for parity, or 361-by-256-kilobit chips.andP;  the memory uses an enhanced page-mode scheme.andP;  Pagedoperations occur with zero wait states, while nonpaged operations have twowait states.andP;  On the average the system operates at 0.8 wait states.andM;The number of slots in this computer may seem limiting at first, buteverything you commonly need is built in.andP;  The serial, parallel, and mouseports come off the motherboard (manufactured by Compaq), as does the videocontroller and the floppy/hard disk controller.andP;  Therefore the slots areavailable for other peripheral controllers to operate such devices as amodem, scanner, or LAN hookup.andM;The Deskpro 386S comes in three models.andP;  The basic configuration has a 1.2MB5-1/4-inch floppy disk drive.andP;  The M odel 20 has a 20MB ST-506/412 MFM harddisk in addition; the Model 40 has a 40MB ST-506/412 RLL hard disk.andP;  Allthree include 1MB of RAM; the video controller; the floppy/hard diskcontroller, serial, parallel, and mouse ports, an AT-style Enhanced keyboard;disk cache software; and Compaq Expanded Memory Manager software.andP;  The basicmodel costs $3,299; the Model 20 costs $3,799, and the Model 40 costs $4,199.andM;When you add a 40MB tape backup unit, a 1.44MB 3-1/2-inch floppy disk drive,a VGA monitor, and Compaq's version of DOS, Release 3.31 (which lets youconfigure your entire hard disk as one volume), as in our test configuration,the price goes up to $6,092.andM;Three of the four drive bays are accessible through the front of thecomputer.andP;  In addition to the 40MB tape backup unit we saw, Compaq offers a135MB tape drive.andP;  The fourth drive bay, which is positioned sideways andbehind the other three, houses the hard disk.andP;  A second hard disk can beadded to the bottom front drive bay.andP;  In addition to those that come in theModels 20 and 40, Compaq offers a 110MB RLL drive.andP;  Just to the right of thedrive bays is the on/off switch and the LED lights for the power and harddisk.andP;  The system's lock is in the rear panel.andM;Attached is the original AT-style keyboard with its smaller Enter key andlarger Backslash key under the Backspace key.andP;  Unlike most newer keyboards,this one has the LED lights for NumLock, CapsLock, and ScrollLock on theindividual keys rather than together in a little panel display.andP;  The keyshave a flat response with a muted clicking sound.andM;Compaq offers two types of monitor, both analog devices with a textresolution of 720 by 400 and a graphics resolution ofandM;640 by 480.andP;   The VGA monitor we reviewedandM;had a screen that measured 13.25 inches on the diagonal and stood 14 incheshigh on a swivel base.andP;  The on/off switch is well positioned on the frontface.andP;  I found the contrast range on the monitor somewhat limited.andM;It's hard to come to a clear judgment on the Compaq Deskpro 386S computer.andO;While a fully configured unit is more expensive than all but two SX machines,the NCR PC916SX and the NEC PowerMate SX, and its performance results aren'timpressive, the machine is very well constructed; it has ample room forexpansion and boasts Compaq's usual stamp of quality in manufacture.andP;  On araw price/performance basis this machine may not be worth the investment, butwhen you factor in the longevity of the computer and its possible resalevalue it may well be a good buy.andP;  It's the same kind of decision you'd haveto make in deciding between buying a Volvo and a Hyundai.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
