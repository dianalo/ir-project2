Those steps met longstanding Soviet requests and marked apolitical milestone for a man who had reacted cautiously to thereforms of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Administration officials said Tuesday, however, that the fineprint still needed to be written on Bush's offers involving thelifting of trade sanctions against Moscow and a halt in U.S.production of chemical weapons.   Although the summit produced no clear arms controlbreakthroughs, and was not expected to, Bush gave Gorbachev thesewelcome bits of news:   _He would take steps to ease tariffs on Soviet exports toAmerica.   _He would seek observer status for the Kremlin in a majorinternational trade group.   _He was altering his previous, and for the Soviets unpalatable,proposal on chemical weapons, seeking to sign a treaty for the Junesummit to destroy most U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons stockpiles.   Several major U.S. and Soviet steps are necessary before Bushgrants the Soviet Union most-favored-nation status, easing tariffson Soviet imports to the United States.   First, the United States and the Soviets must reach a commercialtreaty, said a U.S. official who expects the American side ``to bein talks with the Soviets in the next six or eight weeks.'' Bushproposed that he and Gorbachev sign such a treaty at the summitthey are planning in America in the last two weeks of June.   Second, Bush must waive provisions of a 1974 law that barredmost-favored-nation status for the Soviet Union until the Kremlineased its emigration policies. Soviet authorities have relaxed therules, and the emigration of Jews and other minorities is headedfor record levels this year.   At Malta, however, Bush told Gorbachev he would not waive the1974 law until the Soviet parliament passes legislation giving thenew emigration rules greater permanence, and the parliament is notdue back in session until late January.   Administration lawyers say Bush can waive the law withoutconsulting Congress, but it is not clear whether the Senate or thefull Congress must approve a U.S.-Soviet commercial treaty,according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition they not befurther identified.   Once the sanctions are waived and the treaty signed, Bush plansto ask Congress to lift a $300 million ceiling that it imposed onU.S. government loans to the Soviet Union.   Obtaining observer status for the Soviets on the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade may be just as complex.   Bush told Gorbachev he wanted Moscow to study GATT to encouragegreater Soviet ``engagement with the international market economy.''   Common Market leaders already have advocated Soviet observerstatus in the 97-nation GATT, a status already enjoyed by Hungaryand China.   The concession that Bush made on chemical weapons was designedto speed progress on bilateral as well multilateral treaties,officials said.   Last September at the United Nations, Bush offered to destroy 80percent of U.S. chemical weapon stockpiles if the Soviets reducedto the same level. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadzeresponded that his country was willing to destroy all its chemicalweapons.   Further controversy developed over Bush's statement that theUnited States planned to retain 2 percent of its chemical weaponsuntil the 10th year of a proposed multilateral convention callingupon all nations to destroy their stocks within a decade.   Administration officials later confirmed that this provisionmeant that the United States would continue to make a newgeneration of chemical weapons even after the multilateralconvention was signed, a provision that drew criticism from Moscowand other capitals.   Moreover, Bush said, the United States would not destroy itslast chemical weapons until all nations able to produce chemicalweapons signed the multilateral treaty, which is still undernegotiation.   At Malta, Bush told Gorbachev he was willing to end U.S.production of the new generation of weapons as soon as themultilateral convention takes effect.   Although that gesture is expected to speed work on both thebilateral and the multilateral treaties, a great deal of workremains to be done on both, particularly finding the means to makesure that it is observed, said administration arms controlofficials.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Bryan Brumley writes on national security issuesfor The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
