American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. faced a rebellion Tuesday byseven major computer companies that want to establish a version ofthe Unix software that would not be under ATandamp;T's control.   The companies invited ATandamp;T to join their new Open SoftwareFoundation, but ATandamp;T questioned the group's motives and vowed tocontinue its separate efforts to create a unified computingstandard.   Computer buyers are pressing strongly for a single computingstandard that would make it possible for them to move theirprograms easily from one make of computer to another.   ``There is a need for some standardization and continuity inthis whole process, and somebody needs to play that (oversight)role,'' Larry Bacon, senior vice president of data processing forTravelers Corp. in Hartford, Conn., said in an interview Tuesday.   Unix is a layer of software known as an operating system thatcontrols the basic operations of a computer and lies invisiblybeneath the programs that people use.   ATandamp;T invented Unix but customers of other companies havedemanded it, partly because it makes it easier for computers ofdifferent makes to run the same programs.   The four American and three European computer companies want touse a version of Unix as the core of a standardized ``environment''that will go beyond just the operating system to include the wholescope of computing. They said Tuesday they will spend $90 millionover the next three years.   ``We are certainly most enthusiastic about anything that can bedone to standardize onto a single operating system,'' said BruceRosenblatt, manager of information systems planning for ChevronCorp. in San Francisco. He expressed cautious support for the newfoundation.   Robert Kavner, the new president of ATandamp;T's Data Systems Group,charged in an interview that some members of the Open SoftwareFoundation are not truly interested in openness.   The new group includes the world's two biggest computercompanies, International Business Machines Corp. and DigitalEquipment Corp., as well as Hewlett-Packard Co., Apollo ComputerInc., West Germany's Siemens AG and Nixdorf Computer AG, andFrance's Groupe Bull.   Top executives of all seven companies shared the stage at a NewYork auditorium Tuesday in a rare show of force.   ``Will our companies continue to compete with each other? Ofcourse we will,'' IBM Chairman John F. Akers said. ``This is quitean eventful day, and I believe a good one.''   The seven companies threw ATandamp;T on the defensive, said MarcSchulman, an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc. On the other hand,critics of the Open Software Foundation say its members havereasons for their actions beyond those publicly stated.   IBM and Digital both are strongly committed to their ownoperating systems, which compete with Unix. Keeping customerslocked into their own operating systems gives them some shelterfrom competition.   ``Investors and other people have a right to kind of look attoday's events with a slightly jaundiced eye,'' said John Rutledge,an analyst for Dillon, Read andamp; Co.   But Salomon's Schulman said Hewlett-Packard, which is stronglycommitted to Unix, is the driving force behind the foundation andwould not have aligned itself with IBM and Digital if it fearedthose companies would drag their feet. The Open Software Foundationsaid it will build its new operating system off the base of IBM'sversion of Unix, known as AIX. The software ``environment'' willcomply with a variety of national and international standards.   Other companies are being invited to join the foundation for$25,000 a year and non-profit groups for $5,000 a year. Memberswill contribute staff.</TEXT></DOC>
