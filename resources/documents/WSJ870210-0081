Logue</HL><DD> 02/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><TEXT>   The uproar that accompanied the revelations of insider trading by Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine and others indicates that what they did does not pass a common ethical standard: the &quot;smell test&quot; (as in smelling a rat). However, if we can control our righteous indignation long enough to think clearly on the matter, we will realize that what the inside traders did has merit, in an economic sense. Their actions moved stock prices closer to where they should have been, and because the insiders accumulated large blocks of stock, they enhanced competition for corporate control, thus depriving the shareholders of the first companies to tender for a target stock from reaping unjustifiably large shares of the gains in takeovers.    A study of who wins, who loses and why can show that in insider trading those commonly felt to be the victims really are not, and that those viewed as villainous really are not so vile.    Suppose Company X's stock is selling for $50 a share, but Company Y is preparing to offer $55 each in cash for all Company X's shares immediately after trading closes. Further, Company Y estimates the stock will be valued at $60 after Company Y restructures Company X and bears all the expenses associated with that task. Max the Insider knows all this.    A few hours before Company Y's tender, some shareholders decide to sell because they want cash; others buy because they have spare cash and want to round out their portfolios. If Max the Insider were not active, all the trades would take place at $50; after the tender's announcement, buyers would learn of their windfall while sellers kicked themselves. But fate had dealt each a fair hand.    But suppose Max is active. His buying bids up the price. Sellers get more than $50 by capturing a bit of the windfall. Buyers pay more than $50, but they still come out ahead. Max's action really makes sellers better off and other buyers worse off. And there is also this to consider: Many traders decide to buy or sell based on the price action reported on the tape. Winners and losers in such trades are doing essentially what Max was doing -- trading on information. Max's information was, alas, better. The story continues.    Suppose Max was the only really knowledgeable buyer but could not afford to acquire a substantial position in Company X's stock. Company Y then can buy the stock for $55, though it is really worth $60 to the acquirer. Company Y has special information, too, and the beneficiaries are Company Y's shareholders. Shouldn't everyone who tendered to Y at $55 have a claim against Y for underpaying? Didn't Y have even better information that it used less equitably than Max used his?    Finally, suppose there are several people like Max. They buy X, drive up its price beyond $55, and open up a bidding war because they own enough stock to help A, B or C acquire X. Y wins the war with a bid of $59.50. Y's shareholders still come out ahead, but by less than if there had been no one like Max. X's shareholders also do well. So do Max and his clones.    The chief economic question insider trading raises is whether the market is best served by allocating windfalls randomly, somewhat like a lottery, or by allowing people like Max to invest and profit from superior information-gathering capabilities. Secondary issues abound concerning confidence in the financial markets, market liquidity, and so forth. But these aren't worth dealing with until we decide the prime issue, so that appropriate trade-offs can be fully evaluated.    Although what Max the Insider does may not pass the smell test, it is not at all obvious that it is something our securities-market regulators ought to actively discourage. What they ought to do is consider the question rationally, not viscerally, and do what promotes the greatest economic growth and prosperity.    ---   Mr. Logue is Sullivan/Dean professor of international business at Georgetown. </TEXT></DOC>
