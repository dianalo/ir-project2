No Pickup.</NOTE><DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The governors of Ohio and New York todayproposed a national policy that would sharply reduce acid rain whileprotecting the interests of the coal-producing states.   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and Ohio Gov. Richard Celesterecommended in a joint statement a 10-million-ton reduction insulfur dioxide emissions from utility sources by the year 2003. Theproposal also would authorize $900 million a year to finance up to50 percent of the capital costs.   The plan will be proposed to Congress as an amendment to theClean Air Act. Cuomo and Celeste, both Democrats, said they willpush the agreement as a compromise to the other legislativeproposals in Washington, bogged down in regional fighting, tocontrol acid rain.   Sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal have beenblamed as a major cause of acid rain, which environmentalists say isdestroying waters and woodlands in the Northeast. Much of the sulfurdioxide comes from coal-burning power plants along the Ohio River.   New York is one of eight Northeastern states involved in a U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals suit in Washington against the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency. The states are protesting the EPA'srefusal to revise the air pollution control plans of Ohio, Michigan,Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia and Illinois to reducesulfur dioxide emissions in those states.   The plan calls for reductions in sulfur dioxide emmissions inthree phases: 3.5 million tons by 1993, another 4.5 million tons by1998 and another 2 million tons by 2003.   States would receive about $900 million to pay for the cost ofcompliance. More than two-thirds would be paid by the oil industryand one-third by federal officials. The polluters themselves wouldhave to raise about $900 million under the deal.   The agreement would also establish a 10-year, $2.5 billionexpanded clean coal technology program to achieve reductions insulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. That money would behanded out on the basis of 50 percent matching grants to funddemonstrations of new technologies.   In the joint statement, Cuomo said, ``It is imperative to breakthe impasse that now exists in Congress.''   Celeste's press secretary, Debra Phillips, said the governorconsiders the agreement ``a balance between preserving jobs andcleaning up the environment.''   But a state senator from Ohio's richest coal county, RepublicanRobert Ney from Belmont County, said the agreement is a ``hard slapacross the face'' of Ohio's coal miners.   Ney said he was upset that a deal by Celeste on acid rain mightconflict with the Ohio Legislature's endorsement last week of aresolution calling on that state's congressional delegation tooppose the Clean Air Act and tighter sulfur dioxide emissions.   Ohio Environmental Protection Agency Director Richard Shank saidthe lawsuit is not involved in the agreement.   In Albany, N.Y., Cuomo's chief spokesman, Gary Fryer, said theproposal stemmed from a discussion between the two governors lastJuly at a meeting of the national Democratic Governors' Associationon Mackinac Island, Mich.</TEXT></DOC>
