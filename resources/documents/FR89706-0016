Discovery is designed toenable a party to obtain relevant information needed to prepare the party'scase. These regulations are intended to provide a simple method of discovery.They will be interpreted and applied so as to avoid delay and to facilitateadjudication of the case. Parties are expected to start and complete discoverywith a minimum of Board intervention.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1201.72</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Explanation and scope of discovery.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Explanation.</T3> Discovery is the process, apart from the hearing,by which a party may obtain relevant information from another person, includinga party, that the other person has not otherwise provided. Relevant informationincludes information that appears reasonably calculated to lead to thediscovery of admissible evidence. This information is obtained to assistthe parties in preparing and presenting their cases. The Federal Rulesof Civil Procedures may be used as a general guide for discovery practicesin proceedings before the Board. Those rules, however, are instructiverather than controlling.(b) <T3>Scope</T3>. Discovery covers any nonprivileged matter that is relevantto the issues involved in the appeal, including the existence, discription,nature, custody, condition, and location of documents or other tangiblethings, and the identity and location of persons with knowledge of relevantfacts. Discovery requests that are directed to nonparties and nonpartyFederal agencies and employees are limited to information that appearsdirectly material to the issues involved in the appeal.(c) <T3>Methods.</T3> Parties may use one or more of the methods provided underthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. These methods include written interrogatories,depositions, requests for production of documents or things for inspectionor copying, and requests for admission. Failure to deny a request for admissionwill not be considered a binding admission.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1201.73</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Discovery procedures.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Discovery from a party. </T3>A party seeking discovery from anotherparty must start the process by serving a request for discovery on theother party. The request for discovery_(1) Must state the time limit for responding, as prescribed in andSection;1201.73(d), and (2) In the case of a request for a deposition of a party or of an employeeof a Federal agency that is a party:(i) Must specify the time and place of the taking of the deposition, and(ii) Also must be served on the person to be deposed. When a party directsrequest for discovery to an officer or employee of a Federal agency thatis a party, the agency must make the officer or employee available on officialtime to respond to the request, and must assist the officer or employeeas necessary in providing relevant information that is available to theagency.(b) <T3>Discovery from a nonparty, including a nonparty Federal agency. </T3>Partiesshould try to obtain voluntary discovery from nonparties whenever possible.A party seeking discovery from a nonparty Federal agency or employee muststart the process by serving a request for discovery on the nonparty Federalagency or employee. A party may begin discovery from other nonparties byserving a request for discovery on the nonparty directly. If the partyseeking the information does not make that request, or if it does so butfails to obtain voluntary cooperation, it may obtain discovery from a nonpartyby filing a written motion with the presiding official, showing the relevance,scope, and materiality of the particular information sought. If the partyseeks to take a deposition, it should state in the motion the date, time,and place of the proposed deposition. An authorized official of the Boardwill issue a ruling on the motion, and will serve the ruling on the movingparty. That official also will provide that party with a subpoena, if approved,that is directed to the individual or entity from which discovery is sought.The subpoena will specify the manner in which the party may seek compliancewith it, and it will specify the time limit for seeking compliance. Theparty seeking the information is responsible for serving any Board-approveddiscovery request and subpoena on the individual or entity, or for arrangingfor their service.(c) <T3>Responses to discovery requests. </T3>(1) A party, or a Federal agencythat is not a party, must answer a discovery request within the time providedunder paragraph (d)(2) of this section, either by furnishing to the requestingparty the information or testimony requested or agreeing to make deponentsavailable to testify within a reasonable time, or by stating an objectionto the particular request and the reasons for the objection.(2) If a party fails or refuses to respond in full to a discovery request,or if a nonparty fails or refuses to respond in full to a Board-approveddiscovery order, the requesting party may file a motion to compel discovery.The requesting party must file the motion with the presiding official,and must serve a copy of the motion on the other party and on any nonpartyentity or person from whom the discovery was sought. The motion must beaccompanied by:(i) A copy of the original request and a statement showing that the informationsought is relevant and material; and(ii) A copy of the response to the request (including the objections todiscovery) or, where appropriate, a statement that no response has beenreceived, along with an affidavit supporting the statement.(3) The other party and any other entity or person from whom discoverywas sought may respond to the motion to compel discovery within the timelimits stated in paragraph (d)(4) of this section(d) <T3>Time limits. </T3>(1) Parties who wish to make discovery requests ormotions must serve their initial requests or motions within 25 days afterthe date on which the presiding official issues an order to the respondentagency to produce the agency file and response.(2) A party or nonparty must file a response to a discovery request promptly,but not later than 20 days after the date of service of the request ororder of the presiding official.

The Board will allow appellantsan opportunity to raise allegations of discrimination during the appealsprocess and to present evidence supporting their claims. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1201.152 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Compliance with subpart B procedures. </ITAG>Unless this subpart expressly provides otherwise, all actions involvingallegations of prohibited discrimination must comply with the regulationsthat are included in Subpart B of this part. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1201.153 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contents of petition. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Contents. </T3>A petition for appeal raising issues of prohibited discriminationmust comply with andSection;1201.24 of this part, with the following exceptions:(1) The petition must state that there was discrimination in connectionwith the matter appealed, and it must provide specific examples of howthe agency discriminated against the appellant; and (2) The petition must state whether the appellant has filed a formal discriminationcomplaint or a grievance with any agency. If he or she has done so, thepetition must state the date on which the appellant filed the complaintor grievance, and it must describe any action that the agency took in responseto the complaint or grievance. (b) <T3>Use of form. </T3>Completing the form in Appendix I of these regulationsconstitutes compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;1201.154 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Time for filing petition; closing record in cases involving grievancedecisions. </ITAG>Appellants who file petitions raising issues of prohibited discriminationin connection with a matter otherwise appealable to the Board must complywith the following time limits: (a) Where the appellant has been subject to an action appealable to theBoard, he or she may either file a timely complaint of discrimination withthe agency or file an appeal with the Board within 20 days after the effectivedate of the agency action being appealed. (b) If the appellant has filed a timely formal complaint of discriminationwith the agency: (1) A petition must be filed within 20 days after the appellant receivesthe agency resolution or final decision on the discrimination issue; or(2) If the agency has not resolved the matter or issued a final decisionon the formal complaint within 120 days, the appellant may appeal the matterdirectly to the Board at any time after the expiration of 120 calendardays. (c) If the appellant files an appeal prematurely under this subpart, thepresiding official will dismiss the appeal without prejudice to its laterrefiling under andSection;andSection;1201.12 and 1201.22(b) of this part. Ifholding the petition for a short time would allow it to become timely,the presiding official, in his or her discretion, may hold the petitionrather than dismiss it. (d) If the appellant has filed a grievance with the agency under its negotiatedgrievance procedure in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 7121, he or she may askthe Board to review the final decision under 5 U.S.C. 7702 within 20 daysafter the appellant receives that decision. The appellant must file therequest with the Clerk of the Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Washington,DC 20419.

The issue ofdiscrimination may be excluded from consideration only if the agency showsthat considering the issue would prejudice the agency's rights and undulydelay the proceedings, or if it shows that the discrimination issue isnot directly related to the matter being appealed. If the issue of discriminationis excluded from consideration in the appeal, it will be remanded to theagency for appropriate consideration under any applicable law or regulation.(b) <T3>Effect. </T3>When an appellant raises an allegation of prohibited discriminationthat was previously raised before the agency, the presiding official willdevelop the record sufficiently to make a determination on the merits ofthe allegation. In developing the record under those circumstances, thetime limits imposed on the production of evidence and filing of memorandamay, in order to meet the statutory 120-day processing requirement, bemuch more constricted than those imposed in an appeal under 5 U.S.C. 7701.(c) <T3>Remand. </T3>If the parties file a written agreement that the discriminationissue should be remanded to the agency for consideration, and if the presidingofficial determines that action would be in the interest of justice, themust be completed. In no instance will that time period exceed 120-days.While the issue is pending with the agency, the presiding official willretain jurisdiction over the appeal, and the appeal's adjudication willbe suspended. When the agency has completed its consideration of the issueand returned that issue to the presiding official, that official will mergethe appeal with the agency action on the issue, and will issue a decisionwithin 120-days after the agency returned the issue.
