Neither the Fed nor other major central banks were seen intervening in currency markets yesterday, traders said. But last week's apparently coordinated dollar purchases by the Fed, the West German Bundesbank, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England left many dealers with the impression that the major monetary powers were embarking on another period of close cooperation to support the U.S. currency.    &quot;The spirit of the Louvre may be coming back again,&quot; said Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign exchange manager at European American Bank, New York. Mr. Ryan was referring to the currency rate stabilization agreement signed in Paris last February.    An article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal reporting a shift in U.S. policy toward more emphasis on supporting the dollar also contributed to the currency's strength, traders said.    The dollar continued to strengthen more against major European currencies than against the Japanese yen. Following last week's interest rate cuts in Europe, which made dollar-denominated investments relatively more attractive, Japanese interest rates were left unchanged, maintaining the yield differentials between the U.S. and Japan.    In late New York trading the dollar was quoted at close to its highs of the day. The dollar climbed 0.5% to 1.6783 West German marks, from 1.6695 Friday, while the British pound eased to $1.7863, from $1.7920. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar moved slightly higher to 132.97 yen, from 132.50. In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar opened at 133.05 yen, but soon fell below the 133 yen level on heavy selling by a Japanese trust bank and conflicting rumors about Thursday's U.S. October trade deficit release.    Explaining the recent buying interest in dollars, dealers said the Reagan administration has launched a new drive to support the U.S. currency in response to the European interest rate cuts last week. The administration had been pressing for lower interest rates and more stimulative economic policies abroad, especially from West Germany. Faster growth overseas could spur demand for American products and help narrow the huge U.S. trade deficit, the administration reasoned.    Traders believe West Germany is now getting the cooperation from the U.S. that it sought in countering the dollar's decline, which makes West German exports costly for Americans and puts stress on the European Monetary System, an eight-currency exchange rate mechanism centered around the mark.    &quot;The U.S., as a show of good faith, has gone out to support the dollar, to say 'thank you'&quot; to the West Germans, said Mr. Ryan at European American Bank. &quot;The dollar's looking like it has a new lease on life,&quot; he added.    The dollar could get another lift today if speculation yesterday about another lowering of a key interest rate in West Germany proves correct. The West German central bank, which cut its discount rate last week, may decide to cut more money market rates, making yields on dollar investments more attractive. The Bundesbank is expected to call for tenders on securities repurchase agreements today. The last set of repos were executed at 3.25% before the discount rate cut.    Although sentiment has shifted in favor of the dollar, traders said they remain bearish toward the U.S. currency. Many dealers are watching out for a sell-off of dollars either ahead of or immediately after Thursday's Commerce Department report on the October merchandise trade balance. The U.S. trade deficit remains a big factor in long-term negative outlook for the dollar. &quot;Come Wednesday morning, you'll probably see interest in taking profits on long (or overbought) dollar positions. Old fears of the trade numbers will return,&quot; said Leslie A. Puth, a corporate trader at Banque Indosuez in New York.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.40 an ounce to $481.50 in light trading. The estimated volume was 1.3 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $481.75 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Monday, Dec. 7, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
