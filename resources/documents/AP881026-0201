Frances Jones, a department spokeswoman, said Ernesto Cardinale'srequest for a visa was rejected under two sections of theImmigration and Naturalization Act.   One section prohibits foreigners from receiving a visa if theyhad previously obtained one under false pretenses; another barsanyone who has been associated with the Communist Party fromobtaining a visa.   Jones said she did not know specifically why Cardinale's requestfor a visa was turned down.   ``I don't have details on this and I don't know theparticulars,'' she said.   But she said the department's decision was unrelated to aproclamation signed Tuesday by President Reagan. Reagan said theUnited States will no longer grant entry visas to officials ofNicaragua's leftist Sandinista government because such visits were``detrimental to the interests of the United States.''   The proclamation was partly in retaliation for new restrictionsplaced on U.S. government officials in Nicaragua last month.Relations between the two countries have been particularly strainedsince last July 11 when Managua expelled the American ambassador,and the United States retaliated.   The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada, in its Wednesdayeditions, ran a last page story under the headline: ``The U.S.Declares Visa War.''   The article charged that the denial of official visas was linkedto ``an old plan by the Central Intelligence Agency to try toisolate Nicaragua.''   Cardinale's original itinerary called for him to speakuniversities around the country in late October and early November.   Last month, Ronald M. McAllister, associate dean of NortheasternUniversity in Boston, wrote Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., asking him to``exert some pressure'' to encourage the issuance of Cardinale'svisa so the Nicaraguan could speak on Nov. 3.   McAllister said he was disturbed about the delay in the visaprocess. ``Mr. Cardinale is a well-known figure who has been to thiscountry before and for whom the process of a visa cannot bedifficult, time-consuming or labor-intensive,'' the dean wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
