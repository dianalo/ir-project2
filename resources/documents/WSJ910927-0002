An Interior Department official said the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service will make the recommendation as early astoday in Portland, Ore. Under the Endangered Species Act,granting a species threatened status requires steps to saveit from possible extinction. However, it is a lower-priorityclassification than &quot;endangered,&quot; which requires tougher andswifter action to ensure a species' survival.</LP><TEXT>   The smelt's plight has been closely watched as a test casein the growing confrontation between conservation andeconomics. The three-inch fish lives in the delta formed bythe Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers as they flow into theSan Francisco Bay. It is in trouble in large measure becauseof heavy pumping of water from the delta, most of which goesto irrigate desert farmland in Southern California.   Fish and Wildlife Service field scientists originallyrecommended that the smelt be granted endangered statusbecause it was rapidly headed for extinction. However, afteran unusually heavy lobbying blitz from politically potentagricultural interests, California congressmen and stategovernment officials concerned that tough smelt protectionsmight disrupt the state's water system, the service's topWashington officials rejected the field scientists' findingsand ordered that they recommend no more than threatenedstatus for the fish. The scientists allege that theirsuperiors caved in to political influence, but InteriorDepartment officials heatedly deny that.   The proposal to list the smelt as threatened isn't likelyto satisfy environmentalists and probably will be challengedin court. The Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund already hasthreatened to sue the Fish and Wildlife Service over thesmelt issue. Lawyers there couldn't be reached to comment onhow they intend to proceed.   David Behar, executive director of the Bay Institute ofSan Francisco, an environmental group, said listing the smeltas threatened would be a &quot;grave disappointment.&quot; Mr. Beharsaid: &quot;You have politics deciding the future of a species andan entire ecosystem, and that is a tragedy.&quot;   The proposed listing triggers a review and public commentperiod of up to one year.   ---   Barbara Rosewicz contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
