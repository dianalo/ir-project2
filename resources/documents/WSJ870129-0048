Boesky, pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and agreed to cooperate in the government's continuing investigation of the Boesky case.    Mr. Davidoff is the first person to admit guilt since Mr. Boesky himself agreed last Nov. 14 to plead guilty and began implicating others in Wall Street's largest insider trading scandal.    Mr. Davidoff pleaded guilty to one felony count of willfully violating capital requirements last year while head trader at Seemala Corp., a broker-dealer controlled by Mr. Boesky. He was charged with engaging in bogus securities sales through a London brokerage, Seligmann andamp; Harris, and with conspiring with the firm to conceal the violation. The government didn't allege that Mr. Davidoff profited personally from the violation.    As head trader for Mr. Boesky, Wall Street's biggest arbitrager, Mr. Davidoff, 43 years old, had close contacts with traders at many Wall Street firms and knowledge of Mr. Boesky's trading practices. Anne Ryan, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case, declined to comment beyond the government's prepared statement except to say that aspects of Mr. Davidoff's offense remain under investigation.    Mr. Davidoff couldn't be reached for comment. His lawyer, Paul Rooney, said &quot;Mr. Davidoff deeply regrets his involvement in the Boesky company's failure to remain at all times in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's net capital rules.&quot; Mr. Rooney emphasized that Mr. Davidoff wasn't charged with insider trading. Willful violation of the capital rule carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.    The government wouldn't say what motivated Mr. Davidoff to violate capital requirements, which are intended to protect investors by ensuring that investment firms maintain a minimum ratio between assets and debt.    But Mr. Boesky was known to use leverage to the maximum extent possible, which could have led at times to violations of the regulations.    A former colleague of Mr. Davidoff said that &quot;whatever he did, he was simply carrying out Ivan's orders.&quot; A lawyer for Mr. Boesky declined to comment.    Gary Lynch, head of enforcement for the SEC, declined to comment on the Davidoff case. Mr. Davidoff faces possible SEC charges, according to lawyers familiar with the case.    Mr. Davidoff made no comment at his pleading yesterday before Judge Charles E. Stewart, except to say that he understood the charges. Mr. Boesky's name wasn't mentioned during the court appearance by either side. Mr. Davidoff was released on his own recognizance.    The government's charges against Mr. Davidoff also raise questions about the role of Seligmann andamp; Harris, a medium-sized London brokerage firm often used by Mr. Boesky to execute his trades. The government alleged in the indictment that there was &quot;a secret agreement&quot; between Mr. Davidoff and Seligmann andamp; Harris to disguise what the government characterized as &quot;bogus trades.&quot;    Under the scheme described by the government, Mr. Davidoff sold securities through Seligmann andamp; Harris, but before settlement, bought back the securities, indemnifying the London firm against any losses. The effect of the bogus sales, the government said, was to overstate net capital by making it appear that Seemala had more cash than it actually had.    As previously reported, Robert Harris, the senior partner in Seligmann andamp; Harris, has been named in subpoenas issued by the government in connection with the Boesky investigation. Mr. Harris couldn't be reached last night. Previously he denied that he had ever used information supplied by Mr. Boesky.    Mr. Davidoff had worked with Mr. Boesky longer than any other employee and was extremely loyal to him, colleagues say. He worked with Mr. Boesky as a trader at Edwards andamp; Hanly in the early 1970s, before joining a predecessor of Seemala in 1975. He became a senior vice president in charge of trading for several Boesky entities and served on Seemala's executive committee. Mr. Davidoff is scheduled to be sentenced March 19. </TEXT></DOC>
