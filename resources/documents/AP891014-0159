Wall Street fled from takeover issues Friday as stocks plunged.The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 190.58 points to 2,569.26after the pilot-management group planning to buy United Airlinesparent UAL Corp. said it could not get financing for the deal.   Among the hardest hit were companies involved in takeover fightsand some that have already won their battles. Traders have grownincreasingly uneasy since highly-leveraged deals such as CampeauCorp.'s buyout of Federated Department Stores Inc. and MervGriffin's purchase of Resorts International Inc. have run intotrouble.   UAL shares were down $5.50 to $279.75 when news of the buyoutproblems led to a halt in trading of the airline's stock late inthe session. Trading never resumed and UAL escaped a furtherpounding.   One of the biggest casualties was Time Warner Inc., which is inthe process of completing its $14 billion acquisition of WarnerCommunications Inc. Time Warner skidded $11.25 a share to $131.75,while Warner dropped $5.12{ to $61.50 a share.   Traders abandoned Time Warner because of the company's enormousdebt load. Time Warner will carry $13.6 billion in debt after itcompletes the Warner acquisition.   Paramount Communications Inc., which has been in the market foran acquisition ever since it failed to take over Time Warner'spredecessor, Time Inc., also slumped badly. Paramount fell $6.62{to $56.62{ a share.   AMR Corp., facing a possible $7 billion takeover bid fromdeveloper Donald Trump, slipped 12{ cents from Thursday's close tofinish at $98.62{ a share, but that was down $4.62{ from its highof the day, $103.25, reached at midmorning.   Trading in AMR _ the parent of American Airlines _ also washalted shortly before the market began its plunge. The New YorkStock Exchange reported an order imbalance in the airline's sharesthat likely was caused by heavy selling _ AMR was the 15th mostactive issue on the exchange with more than 1.8 million shareschanging hands.   LIN Broadcasting Corp., the target of an unwanted bid from McCawCellular Communications Inc., was off $5.50 to $107.50, while McCawfell $3.50 to $40 a share.   USX Corp. retreated $4.37{ a share to $33 after having boundedhigher last week on speculation that investor Carl Icahn wouldforce a restructuring of the steel and energy company or even bidfor it.   Takeover stocks have helped carry Wall Street higher for months.But a string of deals have turned bad lately and raised manyuncertainties in the market.   Campeau's announcement last month that it was unable to makeinterest payments on the junk bonds it used to finance its buyoutsof Federated and Allied Stores Corp. caused heavy losses amongthose risky high-yield debt securities.   Campeau, trying to juggle $11.5 billion in debt, has been forcedto put its prize Bloomingdale's store chain up for sale and toengage in other restructuring.   Resorts International is trying to renegotiate its $900 millionin debt after the company was also unable to make interestpayments. Analysts have said entertainer Merv Griffin paid too muchfor the company when he bought it last year from Trump.   And earlier this week, Ramada Inc. said it was forced topostpone its planned $400 million restructuring because ofunfavorable conditions in the junk-bond market. Ramada also was hithard Friday, skidding $1.75 to $9.50 a share, or more than 15percent of its value.</TEXT></DOC>
