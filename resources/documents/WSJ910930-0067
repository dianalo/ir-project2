The documents add details about the level of Bank ofCredit andamp; Commerce International's involvement in Mr.Clifford's financial affairs. They show the ownership of Mr.Clifford and his law partner, Robert Altman, of stock inFirst American Bankshares' holding company was subject to thecontrol of BCCI, and that the two men were aware of thesefacts. Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman had played a major part ina Federal Reserve hearing in 1982, when regulatorsspecifically barred BCCI from financing the purchase of stockin First American's holding company. First AmericanBankshares is the largest bank holding company in Washington,D.C.</LP><TEXT>   The Federal Reserve, the Manhattan District Attorney inNew York and the Justice Department are investigating BCCIand its allegedly illegal acquisition of First AmericanBankshares' parent company in 1982.   BCCI worksheet related to Mr. Clifford's investment andhis potential tax liability refers to &quot;profit payable&quot; of $3million and mentions an as-yet-undisclosed &quot;agreement&quot; --apparently between Mr. Clifford and BCCI -- related to theinvestment.   In letters Messrs. Clifford and Altman wrote to BCCI inJuly 1986 when they borrowed money to buy their stock inFirst American Bankshares' holding company, the two menacknowledged that they couldn't sell that stock without thepermission of BCCI, a unit of BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A.   The letters, which were released by the committee, set outjoint rights between them and BCCI to designate to whom andin what amounts the two men's stock would be sold. Moreover,BCCI said that it would &quot;arrange for the sale of the saidstock&quot; and that it had &quot;firm commitments&quot; from unidentifiedpeople who would purchase these shares at a future date. Thisalso implies that the stock was acquired for the purposes offuture resale.   Both Mr. Clifford and Mr. Altman have said that they wereunaware of BCCI's alleged ownership of First American untilthis year. Their lawyer, Robert Bennett, has said the two menat all times have acted properly and in the best interests ofFirst American. Mr. Bennett didn't return telephone callslate last week and couldn't be reached yesterday.   As reported, Messrs. Clifford and Altman, respectivelychairman and president of First American holding companiesuntil last month, bought stock in the group's parent in 1986.They sold much of this stock in 1988 for huge profits. BCCIfinanced the stock purchases and arranged the advantageoussales.   Separately, Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) said Friday atthe House Banking Committee's third in a series of relatedBCCI hearings that his panel had voted to subpoena documentsfrom the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA held accountsat both BCCI and First American, according to bankers atthose institutions.   The committee, though, is still having trouble obtainingdocuments. The ranking minority committee member, Rep.Chalmers Wylie (R., Ohio), said the Fed recently told himthat &quot;the two most crucial sets of documents to review arethe Clifford andamp; Warnke privileged documents, and the documentsare to be found in the BCCI Washington office.&quot; Clifford andamp;Warnke is Mr. Clifford's law firm.   But, Mr. Wylie added, despite their promises, Mr. Cliffordand Mr. Altman &quot;haven't been forthcoming&quot; with these recordsthat are &quot;crucial to the committee's understanding of theBCCI affair.&quot;   Earlier this year, the Fed charged that BCCI secretly andillegally controlled about 60% of the stock of FirstAmerican's parent company, Credit andamp; Commerce AmericanHoldings N.V., a Netherlands Antilles holding company.   Five senior First American officials and directors whotestified before the House Banking Committee Friday generallyprofessed ignorance of BCCI's alleged ownership at FirstAmerican prior to this year's investigations. First Americandirector and former senator Charles Mathias said that Mr.Clifford had told him that the shareholders were &quot;the mostwonderful people, . . . very wealthy individuals who hadentrusted the operations of First American completely to him,who never interfered in his management of the institution.&quot;   Several members of the committee expressed frustration atthe testimony of the senior First American officials. Rep.Frank Riggs (R., Calif.), who has urged that a specialprosecutor be appointed to review the whole BCCI affair, saidthat &quot;incredulous&quot; and &quot;see no evil, hear no evil, speak noevil,&quot; are the common refrains running through the hearings.   Meantime, A. Vincent Scoffone, director and treasurer ofFirst American Corp., the U.S.-based group holding company,testified Friday that First American paid $227 million toacquire National Bank of Georgia in 1987 from Ghaith Pharaon,a onetime major shareholder in BCCI and an alleged front manfor the rogue bank.   Mr. Pharaon, who has denied wrongdoing, has been accusedby the Federal Reserve of being a front man for BCCI in thepurchase of both National Bank of Georgia and IndependenceBank of Encino, Calif. His subsequent sale of the Georgiabank to First American effectively allowed BCCI to take ahuge profit from First American. Most of the sale proceedsgarnered from First American were immediately used to pay offsome of Mr. Pharaon's borrowings from BCCI.   Rep. James Moran (D., Va.) grilled Mr. Scoffone about theGeorgia purchase, asking repeatedly why First American hadn'tlooked at other institutions in the area before spending somuch for National Bank of Georgia. &quot;You only focused on onebank in Atlanta,&quot; said Mr. Moran, adding that First Americanspent &quot;$227 million for a bank that's worth about $85 milliontoday.&quot; It was also proposed in internal First American memosthat BCCI play a vital role in the transaction by lendingFirst American some of the money for the purchase.   Mr. Scoffone replied that the Atlanta bank was for saleand that First American was competing against another bank toacquire it. Georgia state law, however, had to be changed toallow First American even to complete the takeover. &quot;We haveinformation that you spent a million and a half dollars to dothat,&quot; Mr. Moran said, referring to documents that list costsfor lobbying efforts and other expenses related to gettingthe Georgia state banking laws changed.</TEXT></DOC>
