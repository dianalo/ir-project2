Silver prices on the Commodity Exchange in New York hit their lowest price since March.    Platinum, usually the most volatile precious metal, was under pressure, on wire-service and industry reports that the Soviet Union was selling platinum heavily, said William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, January-delivery platinum fell its daily limit of $25 an ounce for the second consecutive day, to $475.30. The expiring November contract, which has no limits, fell $32.10, to $461.10.    On the Comex, gold was off $9, to $459.20 an ounce in the December contract -- its lowest close since the day after the Oct. 19 stock-market crash. December silver fell 39.5 cents an ounce, to $6.30.    While a promise of inflation normally would drive up prices, statements by the Reagan administration that a possible recession is its main concern hurt metals prices, analysts said.    The amount of the fall &quot;was very shocking,&quot; said Frederick Demler, metals economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He said a number of factors were present that should have helped support the metals market, including uncertainty about the stock market and concern about the dollar getting weaker. Instead, &quot;We see precious metals falling out of bed,&quot; he said.    In the case of platinum, high stockpiles have been a negative factor. According to U.S. Bureau of Mines statistics, there were 1.4 million ounces of platinum in the hands of refiners, importers and dealers, as well as in warehouses of the Comex, at the end of this year's second quarter, more than double the third quarter of 1986.    Analysts noted that despite its drop yesterday, gold has been performing relatively well compared to other precious metals. The $9 drop, after an intraday low of $456, was still above its recent lows. &quot;Gold's holding up because of the weakness in the dollar,&quot; Mr. Demler said.    Jeffrey A. Nichols, president of American Precious Metals Advisors, New York, said in his weekly report yesterday that: &quot;Despite a fairly big step-up in gold buying from investors fleeing other assets, the market has failed to make any substantial and lasting headway because of selling from a variety of sources.&quot;    Recent sellers include stock-market investors trying to raise cash to meet their stockbrokers' margin calls, in some cases &quot;in a panic,&quot; he noted.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Crude-oil futures prices fell for the fourth-straight session, despite a feeling among some analysts that the previous day's drop was as far as the market would go. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude-oil contracts for December delivery fell nine cents, to $18.98 a barrel, after hitting a low of $18.75. Eric Bolling, vice president of futures and options for Geldermann Inc., a New York broker, said high U.S. crude-oil stockpiles and overproduction by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries contributed to a negative psychology in the market. John Hill, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures Inc., New York, said the drop also reflected concern that refining capacity might increase as companies come off scheduled maintainance gearing for the winter. On the spot market, West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell five cents a barrel to $19.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Rumors of Soviet purchases lifted futures prices for grains and soybeans. Meal prices got the biggest lift on speculation that the Soviets bought as much as 350,000 metric tons of meal, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. The Soviets were also thought to be interested in buying 200,000 to two million metric tons of U.S. corn, analysts said. A weaker dollar and statements by Treasury Secretary James Baker that avoiding a recession was a top priority also buoyed the markets. A weaker dollar increases foreign buying power and makes U.S. grain prices more competitive. Wheat closed higher in tandem with corn and beans.    SUGAR: Futures prices rose on purchases by China, but late selling trimmed the advance. March-delivery sugar ended 0.21 cent a pound higher at 7.55 cents, after rising to 7.67 cents. One sugar dealer said China late Wednesday bought 100,000 metric tons of raw sugar from a New York trade house, bringing its purchases to about 750,000 tons in the past four weeks or so. The dealer said China is expected to buy more when prices decline. But an analyst placed China's estimated purchases lower, at 400,000 to 500,000 tons. The dealer said the Soviet Union and India had been regarded as prospective buyers, but neither appeared in the market in the past week. As a result, producers decided to take advantage of the futures-market runup to hedge substantial quantities, the dealer said. This attracted further selling, causing the market to hesitate before the 7.70 cent resistance level and triggering the subsequent setback, he said.    COFFEE: Futures prices advanced in what was termed a largely technical market. December-delivery coffee rose 2.24 cents to settle at $1.259 a pound. Analysts and trade sources said programmed fund buying carried the December contract as high as $1.26 before the market backed off. Rallies have previously encountered resistance around that level, and the inability of the December contract to rise above $1.26 prompted late selling. One analyst said coffee values had been trending higher but were temporarily derailed by the recent wave of selling that swept through futures markets to meet stockmargin calls. &quot;However, strength has returned and traders are watching to see if it can sustain enough drive to top $1.26. If so, the next target is $1.35,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
