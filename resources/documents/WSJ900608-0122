GM said it bested several competitors to win a five-yearagreement to supply nearly $1 billion of pollution-controland engine-control parts to Volga Auto Works, or VAZ, theSoviet Union's largest auto maker. GM said it is alsodiscussing a possible joint venture with VAZ that wouldproduce exhaust-scrubbing devices, or catalytic converters,in the Soviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   Further, GM executive vice president William E. Hoglundsaid the VAZ deal, which had been in the works since lastfall, gives GM an avenue to begin negotiating the purchase ofSoviet platinum. The precious metal is critical to themanufacture of catalytic converters.   The Soviet Union has the largest platinum reserves outsideof South Africa, which is subject to U.S. trade sanctions forits apartheid policies and whose white-minority governmentfaces an uncertain future.   Mr. Hoglund didn't provide details about paymentarrangements for the new deal, but he said GM expects to bepaid in dollars. However, he added, that hinges on VAZ'sability to export the cars outfitted with GM's hardware inreturn for hard currency payments.   Since the Iron Curtain began disintegrating late lastyear, GM has moved quickly to establish a presence in theEast bloc, outflanking arch-rival Ford Motor Co. and mostother major auto makers.   The exception is Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, which haslongstanding and extensive auto alliances with the Soviets aswell as auto makers in Poland and Yugoslavia. Since December,Fiat has broadened its ties with the U.S.S.R. by signingagreements to help the Soviets design three new cars and setup factories capable of building 900,000 cars a year. Fiatand the Soviets also are discussing building an engine plantand a foundry to supply those cars. Fiat will be a 30%partner in the manufacture of one of the subcompact car linesand expects to sell some of the Soviet-made models in WesternEurope beginning in late 1993 or 1994, according to a Fiatspokesman in the U.S. Fiat values these deals at about $5.8billion, the spokesman said.   GM, meanwhile, has signed an accord to build cars in whatis currently East Germany. It has deals to build cars andparts in Hungary, and plans by the end of the year to havedistributors and dealers in six Eastern European countries.   By contrast, Ford last year abruptly pulled out of talksto build cars in the Soviet Union, a move that prompted arebuke from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev during hisU.S. visit last week. Moreover, Ford hasn't announced any newventure in Eastern Europe.   Ford executives have said they don't want to jumpprematurely into countries that are still in politicalturmoil and that have little in the way of convertible hardcurrency and consumer markets that are threadbare at best.   But GM apparently is willing to join Fiat in gambling onan East bloc market renaissance.   At a news conference, Mr. Hoglund made it clear that GM isas excited about the long-term strategic possibilities of itsSoviet venture as it is of the relatively modest parts deal,which he described as &quot;essentially a purchase order.&quot;   &quot;How long will it take the Russians to build a consumermarket? Who knows?&quot; said Mr. Hoglund, who is in charge ofGM's world-wide parts operations. &quot;But the first company inthe market would have a better opportunity to participate.&quot;   GM plans to begin shipping catalytic converters,engine-control computers and fuel-injection systems in 1992to VAZ's factory in Togliatti, about 700 miles southeast ofMoscow. GM expects to ship parts for between 100,000 and150,000 cars annually over the five-year life of the deal.   GM will re-engineer its parts to adapt its systems toVAZ's 1.5 and 1.7-liter engines and will train Soviet workersto assemble the pieces in the Fiat-derived Lada cars theybuild.   GM's emissions-control technology could be important toVAZ's export ambitions as Eastern and Western Europeancountries move to adopt tighter pollution standards, Mr.Hoglund said.   Mr. Hoglund acknowledged that the deal carries some risk.But he stressed that the 150,000 vehicles-per-year volume isa tiny slice of GM's overall capacity to manufactureengine-fuel and exhaust-control systems. GM can make suchsystems for five million vehicles a year.   The &quot;biggest impediment&quot; to the deal's success may be thetangled logistics of communicating with VAZ's Togliatti plantfrom GM's European engineering centers in Western Europe, Mr.Hoglund said.   &quot;There are so many unknowns in how you do business&quot; withthe Soviets, Mr. Hoglund said.</TEXT></DOC>
