The biotechnology concern has been researching the drug for eight years and began testing applications for cancer in December 1983. It recently began advanced clinical trials for treatment of small-cell lung cancer, malignant melanoma and colorectal cancer. The company has also begun more preliminary testing of an application to treat patients with signs of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    Genentech said it first sought the patent in late 1981, and it expects several related patents to be cleared, given the recent patent office action.    Genentech noted that the testing process for cancer drugs is unusually long because of requirements relating to survival rates and the quality of life of treated patients. Therefore, it said its latest tests, would take at least a year if not two to complete.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Genentech closed at $42 a share, up 25 cents.    Other biotechnology concerns have been doing their own research on gamma interferon, but Genentech played down the prospect of any possible legal action against potentially infringing companies until the products are nearer to commercial development. </TEXT></DOC>
