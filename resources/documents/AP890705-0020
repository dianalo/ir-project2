Both, said Shen Tong, marked the beginning of a nation's strugglefor independence.   Shen, a 20-year-old Beijing University biology student, escapedfrom China while on the government's ``most wanted'' list.   As part of their traditional Independence Day celebrations, theAncient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts invitedShen and other Chinese students to set a floral Goddess of Democracyin front of the Old State House.   The statue, created of plastic foam covered with white flowers,was a replica of the one Chinese students erected in TiananmenSquare.   Standing among the uniformed Artillery members, Shen read his owndeclaration of independence.   ``On this spot ... British troops opened fire on peacefulcitizens,'' Shen said. ``People died. People were hurt. But itsparked the American struggle for independence.   ``Exactly one month ago in my country, troops controlled by theLi Peng regime opened fire on a peaceful civilian protest. I do notbelieve that the Tiananmen Square massacre was the end of thedemocracy movement in China.   ``It was the beginning _ a beginning that will lead to a newChina, a China governed by the people and for the people.''   Elsewhere, seven Chinese students at the University of Tulsaannounced at a flag-raising ceremony they want political asylum inthe United States.   ``We feel very strongly, if we go back _ this year, next year orany year _ we really face big danger,'' said Guohua Zheng, a25-year-old graduate student in petroleum engineering at theOklahoma school. The Immigration and Naturalization Service had noimmediate comment.   In Boston, the Chinese students were a new twist on thetraditional Fourth of July celebrations by the artillery company, amilitia founded in 1638.   The Old State House was erected in 1713 as the seat of theBritish colonial government. On March 5, 1770, five unarmedAmericans were killed there while demonstrating against the British.Six years later, the artillery company's Thomas Crafts read theDeclaration of Independence from the balcony of the Old State House.   On Tuesday, Lt. Col. Joseph A. Milano read the declaration. Theartillery company, joined by several other militias in colonial-eracostumes, then held a moment of silence for those who died inTiananmen Square and for American servicemen who died in wars.   Milano said he personally paid for the statue but declined to sayhow much in cost. ``Just say it was about a dollar for every flowerand there weren't less than 2,000,'' he said.   Milano said he has visited China three times since 1983 anddecided to invite the Chinese to take part in the American ceremonybecause he was moved by the historical similarities.   ``It was American patriots at that time and now it's a verysimilar thing,'' Milano said. ``We brought China to Boston.''   Shen, who will not say how he escaped from China, used theceremony to protest the presumed arrest of a friend, student WangDan.   Shen made it clear he is not advocating the armed revolt embracedby the American colonists.   ``For a thousand years in China, it's always been one dynastychanging into another dynasty, one violence into another violence,''Shen said. ``This movement is different. It is non-violent.''</TEXT></DOC>
