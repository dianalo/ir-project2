(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The governor has promised to sign a billpassed by the General Assembly that would make Virginia the firststate in the nation to require instant criminal checks on buyers ofsome handguns and assault rifles.   The bill, passed Thursday by the Senate and the House ofDelegates, requires criminal background checks of residents buyinghandguns with barrels shorter than 5 inches or assault rifles withammunition clips of more than 20 rounds.   State police told legislators a computerized search for recordsof felony convictions could be made during the course of a phonecall.   Out-of-state residents would have to submit to a more complicatedbackground check that could delay a purchase up to a week.   Representatives of the NRA, the Virginia Rifle and RevolverAssociation and Handgun Control Inc. all have said they could livewith the bill.   ``The NRA is holding their noses and saying, `We don't opposeit,''' said Del. William T. Wilson, who fought the measure. ``But Iassure you, they don't like it.''   Wilson said the bill would inconvenience gun dealers and theircustomers and would not accomplish its purpose of keeping guns awayfrom criminals.   Gov. Gerald L. Baliles said the bill would change Virginia'sreputation as a major East Coast exporter of crime weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
