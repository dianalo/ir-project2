Yang's election puts a close ally of senior leader Deng Xiaopingand staunch supporter of Deng's economic reforms in the largelyceremonial but highly visible post.   The 84-year-old Deng remains chairman of the Central MilitaryCommission, his only government post. Like Yang, Deng was the onlychoice for the post in voting among 2,883 delegates of the NationalPeople's Congress.   The legislature also elected Wan Li, who had been vice premier,to head the congress' standing commitee, which is responsible forlegislative matters in between the full congress' once-a-yearsessions.   The National People's Congress, which has been meeting sinceMarch 25, is scheduled to elect the premier on Saturday and vicepremiers on Tuesday.   Li Peng has been acting premier since November and is expectedto be confirmed in that post.   Foreign reporters watched from a balcony in the Great Hall ofthe People as the congress delegates, minus 87 who were said to``have other business,'' marked large orange, red and yellowballots and dropped them in boxes.   It was the first time foreign reporters were allowed to watchthe selection of Communist China's leaders.   In a touch of democracy, 144 candidates were listed for the 135ordinary seats on the congress' standing committee. Delegates alsowere told they could write in other names if they did not like the144 choices.   Also for the first time, legislators could mark their ballots insecret in enclosed areas in the rear of the hall. Most delegates,however, remained in their seats.   Deng and Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang were among thedelegates who voted.   The official Xinhua News Agency announced the results but didnot give vote counts.   Yang and Wan are both strong supporters of Deng's decade-longprogram of introducing market-style economic reforms and shaking upthe stagnant government bureaucracy.   The officials they replace _ 78-year-old Li Xiannian in thepresidency and 86-year-old Peng Zhen as congress chairman _ wereregarded as more conservative.   As president, Yang will play a highly visible role in meetingvisiting foreign heads of state and presenting China's policy tothem. His close ties to Deng give him an influence beyond thepresidency.   Wan's new job as head of the National People's Congress was apowerless one for many years, but under Peng the legislature becamemore active in debating bills and even pressing for amendments.   Deng's decision to stay on as head of the Central MilitaryCommission had been anticipated. The military has been his powerbase since he became top leader in 1978.   In other posts, Wang Zhen, 80, a Long March veteran and CentralMilitary Commission member, was elected vice president.   Nineteen vice-chairmen of the congress standing committee wereelected, including 11 who had served as vice chairman of theprevious congress' standing committee.   Among the eight elected for the first time were Fei Xiaotong,77, a sociologist and head of the China Democratic League, one ofChina's eight officially approved non-Communist parties.</TEXT></DOC>
