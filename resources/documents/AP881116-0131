The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith issued a statementsaying Sununu, the retiring governor of New Hampshire, was the onlygovernor who refused to endorse a proclamation attacking a 1975 U.N.resolution that equated zionism with racism.   At a news conference in Concord, N.H., Sununu, who isArab-American, said he did not endorse the proclamation sponsored byZionist groups because it would have been inappropriate.   ``I have said very clearly that it was inappropriate for agovernor to try to issue something that would have as its focus anattempt to influence foreign policy,'' he said.   But he said that he made sure that the condemnation of the U.N.resolution found its way into the Republican Party platform at thenational convention last summer. Sununu was President-elect GeorgeBush's liaison to the GOP platform committee.   ``So I don't have a problem supporting that in the propercontext,'' he said.   Sources have said Bush has picked Sununu to be the chief ofstaff. Bush has not made a formal announcement, and Sununu has notconfirmed or denied the reports.   The ADL, in a statement from its New York office, said thatSununu was the only governor out of 50 not to endorse theproclamation, ``a position which put him at odds with PresidentReagan, Vice President Bush and both Houses of Congress.''   Despite its criticism of Sununu, the ADL said the governor hasissued proclamations commemorating Israel's 40th anniversary andefforts on behalf of Soviet Jewry.   ``As chief of staff, Gov. Sununu will bear a major responsibilityfor facilitating the implementation of the new president's programand policies as reflected in the Republican Party platform. We hopeand trust he will meet the responsibility,'' the ADL statement said.   Bush, asked about some criticism of Sununu from Jewish leaders,defended the New Hampshire governor as being sensitive to Isrealiconcerns.   ``Sununu is practically the author of the best party platform onthe Middle East that any party has ever had,'' the president-electsaid.   Bush, however, would only shake his head and laugh when askedwhen he would announce his choice for chief of staff.   Sununu said he had ``no problem in stating rather clearly'' thathe believes a key to peace in the Middle East is the ``assurance ofthe integrity and protection of the state of Israel.''   President Reagan, asked for his view on the reported asignment ofSununu to the chief of staff post, praised his record as governor.   ``I have great admiration for him _ I've seen him as governor andwhat he's done ... he's a great governor and if that's what turnsout (that he becomes chief of staff) he'll do a remarkable job,''Reagan said.   The president added that Bush has not asked any advice aboutpossible appointments, but that he would gladly offer it if asked.</TEXT></DOC>
