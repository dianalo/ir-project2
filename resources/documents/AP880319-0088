The census tests are being conducted in St. Louis, and in eastcentral Missouri and eastern Washington state.   Forms are being mailed to most residents of these areas, as wasdone in 1970 and 1980, although census takers will visit householdsin some sparsely settled areas. The effort is expected to continueinto the summer.   The special counts are designed to be as much as possible likethe effort planned for 1990, in order to get an understanding ofwhat problems will develop before the work is begun nationwide,Census Director John G. Keane said.   Earlier tests were conducted in parts of New Jersey, Florida,Mississippi and California. Questions on the forms, while similarto those asked in the past, were developed in a series of more than100 public meetings over the last few years.</TEXT></DOC>
