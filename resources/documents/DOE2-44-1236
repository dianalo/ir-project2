It forecasts the emissions thatcould result from the commercial introduction of a proposed clean coaltechnology, based on a user-defined market. These emission evaluationsfor each proposed technology can be saved for future analysis and comparison.The REDES program gives the user a systematic process for entering thecharacteristics of a particular clean coal technology; it then evaluatesand reports on the potential impact that the introduction and commercializationof this proposed technology would have on the environment. In a sense,REDES is like a black box. It will produce evaluations based on any technologycharacteristics that it receives as input. To help the user of REDESdetermine the performance that might be expected from these emergingtechnologies, a set of generic technology characterizations are providedin the data base as a guide (see Vol.3). REDES is written as a run-timemodule in GURU, an expert system and relational data-base package fromMicro Database Systems, Inc. (MDBS) for the IBM PC and compatibles. REDEScannot be executed without the run-time GURU program. This program mustbe obtained directly from MDBS; it is not available from Argonne NationalLaboratory (ANL). 15 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
