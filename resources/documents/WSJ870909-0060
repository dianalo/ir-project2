New-issue underwriters turned on the spigots in 1981 and since then 2,676 new companies with $72 billion of stock have gushed out. Most of it has landed in the over-the-counter market.    That is more companies than trade on the New York and American stock exchanges combined. And the flow, for the past 20 months, has been accelerating. More than $100 million of new shares is reaching the public market each day, a relentless daily dose equal to 10% of all dollar volume in customer trading on Nasdaq, the National Association of Securities Dealers' automated quotation system. As a result, the volume of shares trading on Nasdaq is mushrooming.    The outpouring of new issues may partly explain the steady decline since 1983 in prices investors have been willing to pay for OTC stocks. At that time, investors were paying an 88% premium for little OTC growth stocks; by the end of last year that premium had vanished and price-earnings ratios had come into line with those of slower-growing mature companies.    &quot;New issues are competing for funds and any factor like this in the market has an effect,&quot; says Gene Finn, chief economist of the NASD. The question is one of degree.    If the mounting supply of new stocks is the primary cause of the recent slump in popularity for existing medium and smaller issues -- both in the OTC market and on the exchanges -- the future would look rosy for most existing issues if the roaring new-issues market slowed. But economists such as Mr. Finn doubt it. Even if the new-issue deluge is only a contributing factor, however, a slowdown of initial public offerings could spell some strengthening in relative prices of medium and smaller stocks.    Although the Dow has tumbled 152 points in the past two weeks, no big underwritings have yet been canceled or postponed, according to Susan Gallant, editor of Going Public: The IPO Reporter. &quot;But that doesn't mean they won't be canceled in the future if the market continues to weaken,&quot; she adds. The biggest new issues on the current calendar aren't scheduled until late this month and October, she adds.    And when the 1981 new-issue surge slackened briefly in 1982 -- the weakest initial-public-offering year since the outburst began -- the P-E ratio of OTC stocks rallied to 1.88 times that of the big Sandamp;P 500 stocks, from 1.51 by the end of the 1981 new-issue boom, a 25% upward adjustment in prices, according to an index kept by T. Rowe Price's New Horizon Fund, an OTC market bellwether.    New issues can hurt prices of existing stocks in two ways. First, the supply of money available for stock market investment is reduced because the funds investors put into new issues exit the market for the coffers of the company going public. At the same time, the supply of shares competing for investment dollars increases as shares in the newly public companies start trading on Nasdaq or one of the exchanges.    And the value of new shares that hit the public market is usually substantially larger than the size of the initial offering. That's because shares usually are underpriced in the initial public offering so they start trading at prices as much as 40% higher than the initial offering price.    In a typical example, McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., a cellular-phone system operator, came out with a $240 million IPO last month. But when these shares opened in Nasdaq trading that same day, new investors paid 13% a share more than the issue price. Within three days the whole issue had turned over and new investors had purchased more than $300 million of stock that days earlier didn't even exist. Beyond that, the initial $240 million went to McCaw. Much of both sums would presumably have gone elsewhere in the stock market, had McCaw stayed home.    History provides few clues as to how much all this may hurt prices of existing stocks that must compete for investor dollars. Never before have new issues approached their current pace. The last prior round of new-issues enthusiasm came in the early 1960s, peaking in 1961 with $3 billion worth.    The market for new issues didn't heat up again until 1981 when the first surge produced $3.2 billion of new stock and added 459 new companies to Nasdaq.    Price-earnings ratios of the smaller OTC companies as compared to big stocks did drop in 1981, and plunged more significantly after an even bigger rush of new companies in 1983, according to the New Horizons Fund index. Last year, as a record $22.4 billion in new issues poured into the market, P-Es of OTC stocks tumbled to their all-time low compared with the bigger stocks. Mr. Finn warns, however, that this could be coincidence.    Academics have yet to fully probe the effect of new issues on other stocks in the market, but they have studied equity issues and stock buy-backs by individual companies. &quot;It does appear true that when a company issues more shares it seems to harm shareholders&quot; by depressing prices, says Keith Howe, a professor at De Paul University in Chicago. &quot;But a change normally has to be sizable to have an effect on the price,&quot; he adds, citing 5% of the stock outstanding as marginal and 10% as almost always significant. </TEXT></DOC>
