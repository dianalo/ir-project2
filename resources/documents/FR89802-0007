That actionwas prompted by the inadvertent opening of the main cargo door on a McDonnellDouglas DC-8 series airplane during flight. This condition, if not corrected,could lead to loss of pressurization and control of the airplane. In 1984, FAA issued AD 84-23-02, Amendment 39-4953, applicable to bothModel DC-8 and DC-9 series airplanes, to require visual inspection of themain cargo door to ensure it is closed, latched, and locked prior to eachtakeoff; or modification of the original door-open indicating system andinstallation of a second door-open indicating system. Since the issuance of those two AD's, a recent accident involving a ModelDC-9 series airplane occurred, in which the main cargo door inadvertentlyopened during takeoff or shortly thereafter. This has prompted the FAAto further review the Model DC-8 main cargo door, since the design is similarto that of the Model DC-9. The review examined the main cargo door design,prior incidents of main cargo door inadvertent openings in flight, maintenanceof the door, all available service information, and the existing airworthinessdirectives concerning the Model DC-8 main cargo door. The FAA has determined that some Model DC-8 airplanes may not have properexterior markings on the main cargo door, which are necessary to determinevisually that the door is properly closed, latched, and locked. Also, theFAA has been advised that some crew members are leaning outside the mainentrance door to visually check that the latch controls on the cargo doorare in the locked position. Door locked indication can not be properlyascertained from the main entrance door. The airplane involved in the accident described above did not have thedual door-open indicating system installed; its operator opted to relyon the visual inspection method of AD compliance. Aircraft which do nothave the dual door-open indicating system (described in McDonnell DouglasDC-8 Service Bulletin 52-76) installed could have a latent failure conditionin the original door-open indicating system such that the door-open annunciatinglight can extinguish with the cargo door merely resting on the door jambin the closed, but not latched and locked, position. Also, properly securingthe main cargo door hydraulic control panel access door can prevent inadvertentmovement of the hydraulic control valve operating handle which is usedto activate (open) the main cargo door. Based on the FAA review of themain cargo door design, operation, and maintenance, the FAA has determinedthat additional inspections, modifications, and checks are necessary toensure that the Model DC-8 main cargo door is properly closed, latched,and locked prior to flight.The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas All Operators Letter(AOL) 8-669, dated April 19, 1974; AOL 8-669A, dated April 30, 1974; andDC-8 Service Bulletin 52-76, Revision 3, dated January 29, 1976; whichdescribe inspections, modifications, and checks of the main cargo doorhydraulic control valve and control panel access door, the original door-openindicating system, and the new redundant door-open indicating system. TheFAA has also approved the exterior markings on the main cargo door whichare used when visually determining that the door is closed, latched, andlocked. McDonnell Douglas has also developed additional safety features to preventthe door from opening in flight. The FAA has approved McDonnell DouglasDC-8 Service Bulletins 52-74, Revision 2, dated November 19, 1975, whichdescribes installation of a hydraulic isolation valve to shut off the hydraulicpressure to the control valve when the system is not in use; Service Bulletin52-75, Revision 1, dated August 9, 1974, which describes installation ofa viewing window in the exterior skin of the door for visual inspectionof the lockpin position; and Service Bulletin 52-80, dated March 23, 1977,which describes installation of a vent door to improve the positive lockfeature of the cargo door latching and locking system and to limit pressurizationof the airplane. Since this situation is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design, this AD supersedes AD 75-03-02 and AD 84-23-02, andrequires additional inspections, modifications, and checks of the maincargo door in accordance with the service bulletins previously described.All requirements currently imposed by AD 75-03-02 are incorporated intothis AD. The requirements of this AD supersede the requirements of AD 84-23-02 byrequiring the operator to document compliance with the visual check requirementto ensure that the door is closed, latched, and locked prior to takeoff;deleting the requirement that a flight crew member, a mechanic, or a rampsupervisor ensure that the main cargo door is closed, latched, and lockedprior to takeoff, placing that responsibility on the operator; requiringthat the visual check of the exterior manual latch controls be accomplishedfrom outside the airplane. In addition, the operator must provide qualifiedpersonnel and training on the door closing, latching, and locking procedures,as well as documentation of compliance with this AD. This AD also requires additional inspection, modification, and checks byrequiring initial and repetitive checks of the original door-open indicatingsystem; initial and repetitive inspections of the main cargo door controlpanel access door and ``T'' handle clip; and inspection and remarking,if necessary, of the main cargo door exterior lockpin handle and latchactuating shaft markings. Accomplishment of the modifications specified in McDonnell Douglas DC-8Service Bulletins 52-74 R2, 52-75, 52-76 R3, and 52-80 will terminate certaininspections and checks required by this AD. The requirements of this AD are considered to be interim measures. TheFAA is currently evaluating all available modifications to the main cargodoor system, as well as other actions, and may propose additional mandatorycorrective actions to ensure that the Model DC-8 main cargo door will notinadvertently open in flight. Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediately tocorrect an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If it is determinedthat this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOTRegulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation willbe prepared and placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluationis not required). A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the RulesDocket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
