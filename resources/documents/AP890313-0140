Adviser Yossi Ben-Aharon, said on Israel radio: ``If the UnitedStates can help we will be happy to use its assistance, but notthrough a dialogue with the PLO.   ``We do not object to a system of understandings to which we willalso contribute, because we have an interest in creating anatmosphere for negotiations,'' he said. ``But we are not ready toaccept the PLO as a partner in any deal.''   A new rift developed in Israel's coalition government overIsraeli and U.S. news reports saying American officials plan topropose that Israel and the PLO take steps to quell the 15-monthPalestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,creating an ``atmosphere'' for peace talks.   The appeals to both Israel and the Palestine LiberationOrganization appeared aimed at bringing the two sides togethereventually.   Israel's government is led by Shamir of the hard-line, right-wingLikud bloc, with the center-left Labor Party as an uneasy partner.   Shamir brands Yasser Arafat's PLO a terrorist group and sayspeace cannot be made with such an organization.   Communications Minister Gad Yacobi of the Labor Party said, alsoon Israel radio, that Israel should be responsive to the U.S. offer.   ``The U.S. readiness to become a mediator between Israel and thePalestinians has to be welcomed by the state of Israel,'' Yacobisaid. ``We have to be ready to negotiate a peace treaty or apolitical settlement between Israel and the Palestinians who live inthe territories, even if they are affiliated, directly orindirectly, with the PLO.''   Cabinet Minister Mordechai Gur, also of Labor, said ``Israeli-PLOtalks today can lead to a disaster, because the differences ofpositions are so deep.''   But he endorsed an indirect dialogue, saying ``a limited programof achieving tranquillity by mutual steps ... can lead to a changein the positions followed by elections in the territories.''   The Likud faction responded in Parliament by calling on Laborministers to confine themselves to their ministerial duties andavoid making ``irresponsible statements which are damaging forIsrael's interests.''   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens met President Bush and Secretary ofState James Baker III in Washington on Monday. The trip is inadvance of Shamir's planned Washington visit in April.   Since Palestinians began their uprising against Israeli rule inDecember 1987, the insurrection has killed 396 Palestinians and 17Israelis.   A Palestinian, Saris Atawna, 30, was found beaten to death Mondayin Gaza City's main square, and a sign next to his body said he waskilled for selling drugs and helping Israel, Arab reports said.   The army said the body of a known drug dealer was found and thatit was investigating.   Two Palestinian teen-agers suffered bullet wounds on Monday inclashes between soldiers and stone-throwing youths in Beit Hanoun inthe Gaza Strip, Arab news reports said.   In south Lebanon on Monday, Israeli troops killed at least threePalestinian guerrillas in a gunbattle illuminated by parachuteflares after a chase through hills near Israel's border.   It was the second day straight that Israeli soldiers foughtguerrillas in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone who were headedfor attacks in northern Israel.   Monday's political furor was not seen as threatening thecoalition government as long as its majority, including party leaderand Finance Minister Shimon Peres, oppose direct talks with the PLOand see themselves bound by the coalition agreement that rules outtalks with the organization.   But many senior Labor members agree with Cabinet Minister EzerWeitzman, who said Sunday that Israel should negotiate under certainconditions.   Their feelings reflect a shift in public opinion in Israel.According to a December public opinion poll, 55 percent of thepublic now support peace talks with the PLO.</TEXT></DOC>
