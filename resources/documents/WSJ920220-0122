Unlike some earlier analyses, the new one adjusts for theshrinking size of U.S. families, but comes up with the sameconclusion: that the distribution of income is becominggradually, but noticeably, more unequal.</LP><TEXT>   In 1989, the Census Bureau says, 14.7% of all persons wereat the top of the income ladder, compared with 11.9% in 1979.Some 22.1% were at the bottom in 1989, compared with 20% in1979. Meanwhile, the portion of the population in the middlefell to 63.3% in 1989 from 68% a decade earlier.   The changes in income distribution during the 1980scontinued a trend set in the 1970s. &quot;From 1969 to 1989, thedistribution of income was marked by an increase in overallinequality,&quot; the bureau said in a new report, &quot;Trends inRelative Income, 1964 to 1989.&quot; That reverses a trend towardsequality between 1964 and 1969.   The new report also highlights how harshly the economy hastreated children in recent years. In 1989, 29.1% of allchildren under age 18 were in the lower-income category. Incontrast, only 19.4% were in that category 20 years earlier.   The report introduces a new concept called &quot;relativeincome.&quot; After adjusting for family size, the measurecompares people's income with the median income for the wholepopulation. People with less than half the median income areconsidered to have &quot;low&quot; income. Those with more than twicethe median are considered to have &quot;high&quot; income. Everyoneelse is in the middle.   In 1989, the median income for families of four was$37,152, so families with income below $18,576 wereclassified as &quot;low&quot; income, and ones with income above$74,304 were in the &quot;high&quot; income category.   &quot;The measure is well-suited for studying the extent ofincome inequality and changes over time in inequality,&quot; theCensus Bureau said.   The new report uses only cash income, including governmentcash benefits, before taxes. It excludes government-providedhealth insurance and other non-cash benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
