In general, the Board believes thatandSection; 701.31 is not in need of major revision. The Board proposes tosimplify and clarify the regulation by making several technical changes.Changes to the Federal Fair Housing Act and the Department of Housing andUrban Development's regulations require minor amendments to andSection; 701.31and to NCUA's Federal Fair Lending poster.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before August 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send comments to Becky Baker, Secretary of the Board,National Credit Union Administration, 1776 G Street, NW., Washington, DC20456.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Roy DeLoach, NCUA, Office of GeneralCounsel, 1776 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20456, telephone: (202) 682-9630.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On October 24, 1988, the NCUA Board published a Request for Comments concerningandSection; 701.31 of the NCUA's Rules and Regulations_NondiscriminationRequirements (<T3>see </T3>53 FR 41609). The comment period ended on January 23, 1989.Only four comment letters were received. Two national credit union tradeassociations, one state credit union league, and one Federal credit unioncommented. Three of the commenters were satisfied with the regulation inits present form. One commenter suggested technical and clarifying changes.In the interest of keeping this section simple to use and understand, theNCUA Board is proposing only minor technical changes and changes requiredby the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. The substantive changes requiredby the Fair Housing Amendments Act expand prohibited housing practicesto include handicap and familial status. The NCUA's Fair Lender posterhas also been revised to include these changes.Section 701.31 is designed to summarize in one place the prohibitions ondiscrimination in lending activities contained in: (1) the Federal HousingAct (42 U.S.C. 3601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)regulations issued thereunder; and (2) the Equal Credit Opportunity Act(15 U.S.C. 1691) and the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation B (12 CFR Part202) issued thereunder. The NCUA last amended andSection; 701.31 on August31, 1979 (44 FR 51191).The Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.) contains provisions prohibitingdiscrimination in real estate lending. HUD has promulgated regulationsimplementing the Fair Housing Act (<T3>see </T3>24 CFR Parts 14, 100, 103, 104, 105, 106, 109, 110, 115, and121). Although not required to do so, the NCUA promulgated andSection; 701.13implementing the Fair Housing Act's provisions and certain provisions ofthe Equal Credit Opportunity Act as they apply to FCU lenders.The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-430, approved September13, 1988) amended the Fair Housing Act. On January 23, 1989, HUD promulgatedregulations implementing these changes (54 FR 3232). The effective dateof the new HUD regulations was March 12, 1989.The Fair Housing Amendments Act expands the coverage of the Fair HousingAct to prohibit discriminatory housing practices based on familial status(having children under the age of 18) and handicap, establishes an administrativeand judicial enforcement mechanism for cases where discriminatory housingpractices cannot be resolved informally, and provides for monetary penaltiesin cases where discrimination is found. The Fair Housing Amendments Actalso establishes design and construction requirements for certain new multifamilydwellings for first occupancy on or after March 13, 1991, and an exemptionfrom the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of familial statusfor certain housing for older persons. (<T3>See </T3>24 CFR Parts 100-121 for more detailed guidance on new requirements.)Section 701.31 also implements certain provisions of the Equal Credit OpportunityAct (``ECOA'') (15 U.S.C. 1691). Again, NCUA is not required to promulgateregulations implementing the ECOA. Regulation B (12 CFR Part 202), promulgatedby the Federal Reserve Board, is the implementing regulation for the ECOA.All credit unions, including Federal credit unions (``FCU's''), must complywith Regulation B. The NCUA is the enforcement agency with respect to FCU's.The Federal Trade Commission is the enforcement agency with respect toall other credit unions. (<T3>See </T3>15 U.S.C. 1691c and 12 CFR Part 202 App. A.)A general description of each paragraph of andSection; 701.31 and the proposedmodifications follow. The NCUA Board requests comment on the proposed changesand any other proposed modifications to the regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>Section 701.31(a) contains three definitions_that of application, dwelling,and real estate-related loan. The definition of application is taken fromRegulation B. The definitions of dwelling and real estate-related loanare taken from the Fair Housing Act. There are no proposed changes to thedefintions.Section 701.31(b)(1) presently prohibits discrimination on the basis ofrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin of the applicant, jointapplicants, persons associated therewith, present or prospective owners,lessees, tenants or occupants of the dwelling upon which a loan is requestedor dwellings in the same vicinity. These are prohibitions found in theFair Housing Act (<T3>see </T3>42 U.S.C. 3605). The Fair Housing Amendments Act prohibitsdiscrimination based on two additional classifications_handicapped personsand familial status. The proposed rule amends andSection; 701.31(b)(1) toadd these two new classifications.Section 701.31(b)(2) presently prohibits the use of a landing criterionor policy which has the effect of discriminating on the basis of race,color, religion, sex, or national origin. The proposed rule amends andSection;701.31(b)(2) to add the two new classifications of discrimination (handicapand familial status) added by the Fair Housing Amendments Act. There isalso one technical amendment deleting ``of this Part'' from the last sentenceof this section.Section 701.31(b)(3) lists factors that generally have a discriminatoryeffect and are therefore prohibited. There are no proposed changes to thissection.Sections 701.31(c)(1)-(3) are similar to andSection; 701.31(b)(1)-(3) exceptthat they apply to appraisals of a dwelling. As stated above, the FairHousing Amendments Act prohibits discrimination based on two additionalclassifications_handicapped persons and familial status. Proposed andSection;701.31(c) (1) and (2) are amended to reflect these changes. There are noproposed changes to andSection;701.31(c)(3).Section 701.31(c)(4) states that certain factors concerning a dewlling'slocation may be legally relied upon, despite andSection; 701.31(c)(3). TheNCUA proposes one technical amendment deleting ``of this Part'' from thelast sentence of andSection; 701.31(c)(4).Section 701.31(c)(5) requires that an FCU retain an appraisal and makesuch appraisal available to the loan applicant for 25 months. There areno proposed changes to this section.Sections 701.31(d) (1)-(3) require FCU's to provide notice of nondiscriminationin all pertinent advertising. HUD regulations require that a poster settingforth notice of nondiscrimination be displayed by real estate lenders.The poster must contain specifically worded nondiscrimination pledges,the equal housing logo, and regulatory contacts for complaints of discrimination.(<T3>See </T3>24 CFR Part 110.) Federal financial regulators, such as NCUA,may request a waiver of HUD's poster requirement and substitute a similarposter for the financial institutions they regulate. (<T3>See </T3>24 CFR 110.25(b).) In a letter dated March 14, 1989, fromHUD's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity,NCUA received a waiver of the HUD poster requirements and approval of asubstitute poster for Federal credit unions. The waiver permits FCU's todisplay NCUA's poster in place of HUD's poster. The waiver does not affectthe application of the Fair Housing Act of HUD's regulations to FCU's.Proposed andSection; 701.31(d)(3) is amended to reflect the approved posterfor FCU's. A copy of the new poster has been sent to all FCU's. Duplicatesare available from NCUA's Regional Offices.Section 701.31(e) sets out guidelines that explain and interpret the requirementsfound in andSection; 701.31 (a)-(d). One minor change is proposed in thissection. Section 701.31(e)(1) explains the ``effects test'' of discriminationand then cites two Supreme Court cases that describe the test. The NCUABoard proposes to eliminate reference to these two cases. Casde citationsrarely, if ever, appear in the NCUA Rules and Regulations. The NCUA Boarddoes not believe they add anything to this regulation and, therefore, proposesthat they be deleted. The NCUA Board also proposes to amend this sectionto include handicap and familial status as prohibited bases of discrimination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>This proposed rule makes no substantive changes to the current rule. Neithera Regulatory Flexibility Analysis nor Paperwork Reduction Act analysisare required.Executive Order 12612This regulation explains the law and sets forth previously establishedguidelines for Federal credit unions; it adds no new obligations. AlthoughFederal statutes prohibiting discrimination (Fair Housing Act and EqualOpportunity Act) apply to state-chartered credit unions as well, this regulationdoes not apply to them.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701</ITAG>Credit unions, Discrimination in real estate lending.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on May 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA proposes to amend its regulation as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 701_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

Section 701.31 is also authorizedby 15 U.S.C. 3601-3610.</ITAG>2. Section 701.31 is revised as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 701.31</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Nondiscrimination requirements.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Definitions: </T3>As used in this part, the term: (1) ``Application'' caries the meaning of that term as defined in 12 CFR202.2(f) (Regulation B), which is as follows: ``an oral or written requestfor an extension of credit that is made in accordance with procedures establishedby a creditor for the type of credit requested''; (2) ``Dwelling'' carries the meaning of that term as defined in 42 U.S.C.3602(b) (Fair Housing Act), whis as as follows: ``Any building, structure,or portion thereof which is occupied as, or designed or intended for occupancyas, a residence by one or more families, and any vacant land which is offeredfor sale or lease for the construction or location thereon of any building,structure, or portion thereof''; and (3) ``real estate-related loan'' means any loan for which application ismade to finance or refinance the purchase, construction, improvement, repair,or maintenance of a dwelling. (b) <T3>Nondiscrimination in Lending. </T3>(1) A Federal credit union may notdeny a real estate-related loan, nor may it discriminate in setting, orexercising its rights pursuant to, the terms or conditions of such a loan,nor may it discourage an application for such a loan, on the basis of therace, color, national origin, religion, sex, handicap, or familial status(having children under the age of 18) of: (i) Any applicant or joint applicant; (ii) Any person associated, in connection with a real estate-related loanapplication, with an applicant or joint applicant; (iii) The present or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupantsof the dwelling for which a real estate-related loan is requested; (iv) The present or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupantsof other dwellings in the vicinity of the dwelling for which the real estate-relatedloan is requested. (2) With regard to a real estate-related loan, a Federal credit union maynot consider a lending criterion or exercise a lending policy which asthe effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin,religion, sex, handicap, or familial status (having children under theage of 18). Guidelines concerning possible exceptions to this provisionappear in andSection; 701.31(e)(1).(3) Consideration of any of the following factors in connection with areal estate-related loan is not necessary to a Federal credit union's business,generally has a discriminatory effect, and is therefore prohibited: (i) The age or location of the dwelling;(ii) Zip code of the applicant's current residence; (iii) Previous home ownership; (iv) The age or location of dwellings in the neighborhood of the dwelling;(v) The income level of residents in the neighborhood of the dwelling.(c) <T3>Nondiscrimination in Appraisals. </T3>(1) A federal credit union maynot rely upon an appraisal of a dwelling if it knows or should know thatthe appraisal is based upon consideration of the race, color, nationalorigin, religion, sex, handicap, or familial status (having children underthe age of 18) of: (i) Any applicant or joint applicant;(ii) Any person associated, in connection with a real estate-related loanapplication, with an applicant or joint applicant; (iii) The present or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupantsof the dwelling for which a real estate-related loan is requested; (iv) The present or prospective owners, lessees, tenants, or occupantsof other dwellings in the vicinity of the dwelling for which a real estate-relatedloan is requested. (2) With respect to a real estate-related loan, a Federal credit unionmay not rely upon an appraisal of a dwelling if it knows or should knowthat the appraisal is based upon consideration of a criterion which hasthe effect of discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin,religion, sex, handicap, or familial status (having children under theage of 18). Guidelines concerning possible exceptions to this provisionappear in andSection; 701.31(e)(1).(3) A Federal credit union may not rely upon appraisal that it knows orshould know is based upon consideration of any of the following criteria,for such criteria generally have a discriminatory effect, and are not necessaryto a Federal credit union's business:(1) The age or location of the dwelling; (ii) The age or location of dwellings in the neighborhood of the dwelling;(iii) The income level of the residents in the neighborhood of the dwelling.(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, it is recognizedthat there may be factors concerning location of the dwelling which canbe properly considered in an appraisal. If any such factor(s) is reliedupon, it must be specifically documented in the appraisal, accompaniedby a brief statement demonstrating the necessity of using such factor(s).Guidelines concerning the consideration of location factors appear in andSection;701.31(e)(3). (5) Each Federal credit union shall make available, to any requesting member/applicant,a copy of the appraisal used in connection with that member's real estate-relatedloan application. The appraisal shall be available for a period of 25 monthsafter the applicant has received notice from the Federal credit union ofthe action taken by the Federal credit union on the real estate-relatedloan application. (d) <T3>Nondiscrimination in advertising._</T3>(1) <T3>Advertising notice of nondiscrimination compliance. </T3>(i) No Federalcredit union may directly or indirectly engage in any form of advertisingof real estate-related loans which implies or suggests that the Federalcredit union discriminates in violation of the provisions of the Fair HousingAct of 1968 or of this Section. Advertisements of such loans shall includea facismile of the following: <G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus. 1310</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/>(ii) Advertisements of real estate-related loans which are broadcast onthe radio shall contain the following statement: ``The (insert name) FederalCredit Union is an equal housing lender.''(2) <T3>Lobby notice of nondiscrimination compliance. </T3>Every Federal creditunion which engages in real estate-related lending shall conspicuouslydisplay in the public lobby of such credit union and in the public areaof each office where such loans are made, in a manner so as to be clearlyvisible to the general public entering such lobby or area, a notice thatincorporates a facsimile of the logotype and notice appearing in paragraph(d)(3) of this section. Posters containing this notice and logotype maybe obtained from the Regional Offices of the National Credit Union Administration.(3) <T3>Logotype and notice of nondiscrimination compliance. </T3>The logotypeand text of the notice required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shallbe as follows:<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7535-01-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2 1312</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7535-01-C</ITAG>(e) <T3>Guidelines. </T3>(1) Compliance with the Fair Housing Act is achievedwhen each loan applicant's creditworthiness is evaluated on an individualbasis, without presuming that the applicant has certain characteristicsof a group. If certain lending policies or procedures do presume groupcharacteristics, they may violate the Fair Housing Act, even though thecharacteristics are not based upon race, color, sex, national origin, religion,handicap, or familial status. Such a violation occurs when otherwise faciallynondiscriminatory lending procedures (either general lending policies orspecific criteria used in reviewing loan applications) have the effectof making real estate-related loans unavailable or less available on thebasis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, handicap, or familialstatus. Note, however, that a policy or criterion which has a discriminatoryeffect is not a violation of the Fair Housing Act if its use achieves alegitimate business necessity which cannot be achieved by using less discriminatorystandards. It is also important to note that the Equal Credit OpportunityAct and Regulation B prohibit discrimination, either per se or in effect,on the basis of the applicant's age, marital status, receipt of publicassistance, or the exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit ProtectionAct.(2) Paragraph (b)(3) of this section prohibits consideration of certainfactors because of their likely discriminatory effect and because theyare not necessary to make sound real estate-related loans. For purposesof clarification, the prohibited use of location factors in this sectionis intended to prevent abandonment of areas in which a Federal credit union'smembers live or want to live. It is not intended to require loans in thoseareas that are geographically remote from the FCU's main or branch officesor that contravene the parameters of a Federal credit union's charter.Further, this prohibition does not preclude requiring a borrower to obtainflood insurance protection pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Actand Part 760 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations, nor does it preclude involvementwith Federal or state housing insurance programs which provide for lowerinterest rates for the purchase of homes in certain urban or rural areas.Also, the legitimate use of location factors in an appraisal does not constitutea violation of the provision of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, whichprohibits consideration of location of the dwelling. Finally, the prohibiteduse of prior home ownership does not preclude a Federal credit union fromconsidering an applicant's payment history on a loan which was made toobtain a home. Such action entails consideration of the payment recordon a previous loan in determining creditworthiness; it does not entailconsideration of prior home ownership.(3)(i) Paragraph (c)(3) of this section prohibits consideration of theage or location of a dwelling in a real estate-related loan appraisal.These restrictions are intended to prohibit the use of unfounded or unsubstantiatedassumptions regarding the effect upon loan risk of the age of a dwellingor the physical or economic characteristics of an area. Appraisals shouldbe based on the present market value of the property offered as security(including consideration of specific improvements to be made by the borrower)and the likelihood that the property will retain an adequate value overthe term of the loan.(ii) The term ``age of the dwelling'' does not encompass structural soundness.In addition, the age of the dwelling may be used by an appraiser as a basisfor conducting further inspections of certain structural aspects of thedwelling. Paragraph (c)(1) of this section does, however, prohibit an unsubstantiateddetermination that a house over X years in age is not structurally sound.(iii) With respect to location factors, paragraph (c)(2) of this sectionrecognizes that there may be location factors which may be considered inan appraisal, and requires that the use of any such factors be specificallydocumented in the appraisal. These factors will most often be those locationfactors which may negatively affect the short range future value (up to3-5 years) of a property. Factors which in some cases may cause the marketvalue of a property to decline are recent zoning changes or a significantnumber of abandoned homes in the immediate vicinity of the property. However,not all zoning changes will cause a decline in property values, and proximityto abandoned buildings may not affect the market values of a property becausethe cause of abandonment is unrelated to high risk. Proper considerationsinclude the condition and utility of the improvement and various physicalfactors such as street conditions, amenities such as parks and recreationareas, availability of public utilities and municipal services, and exposureto flooding and land faults.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-12212 Filed 5-19-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7535-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
