The company said despite precautions taken after a virus wasdiscovered in its FreeHand drawing program last March, a new virushas turned up in an updated version of FreeHand.   An entire computer network within Aldus' headquarters has beeninfected, the company said.   ``We don't know where it came from,'' said Jane Dauber, an Aldusspokeswoman. ``That is the nature of the virus. You can't reallytrack it.''   Viruses are small computer programs, created by programmers asjokes or acts of vandalism, which secretly attach themselves toother programs. The virus can then spread from computer to computerwhen operators share ``infected'' programs.   At their most benign, viruses merely flash a message on acomputer screen. At their worst, they can destroy informationstored in computer memories.   Last month, a former Fort Worth, Texas, programmer was convictedof planting a virus in his employer's computer system. Two daysafter the employee was fired, the virus activated, erasing 168,000company records.   Aldus officials said their new virus, dubbed ``nVir,'' hasremained dormant so far, just a tiny program that attaches itselfto other programs.   ``We don't know why, we don't know what invokes this virus,''said Dauber. ``With some of them, you have to launch the program acertain number of times,'' for the virus to activate.   Aldus said does not know where the virus originated, althoughthe company said the virus apparently has infected at least oneEast Coast university's computers. The name of the university wasnot immediately available.   ``You just can't always stop these things from coming in thedoor,'' said Laury Bryant, a company spokeswoman. ``But what wehave done is to set up systems which elminate them before they areactually in full version, shrink-wrap software and stop them fromgoing out the door.''   Aldus says it uses rigorous testing procedures to check forviruses in products before they are shipped to retailers. Still,the virus was found in a version of FreeHand software sent tospecific users to be tested before the program is offered for sale.   One of those users discovered the nVir virus and notified Aldus.   Two days later, the software company realized the virus was inits own in-house network of computer syustems. It is not known howfar the virus has spread.   Aldus is a leading manufacturer of programs for ``desktoppublishing,'' in which publications are written, assembled andedited on computers. FreeHand, written for Apple Macintoshcomputers, allows computer operators to draw graphics.   In March, in what was apparently the first instance of a virusattaching itself to a commercial software program, a virus calledthe ``March 2 peace message'' was found in some FreeHand programs.At that time, Ms. Bryant said the message did not harm anycomputers and only flashed a brief message on computer screens. Thevirus died out of computers on March 2.   The infection forced Aldus to recall or rework thousands ofpackages of the new software.</TEXT></DOC>
