Gross Revenue Method of Amortizing Capitalized Costs<T3>Facts</T3>: Rule 4-10(i)(3)(iii) of Regulation S-X states in part:<ITAG tagnum="21">Amortization shall be computed on the basis of physical units, withoil and gas converted to a common unit of measure on the basis of theirapproximate relative energy content, unless economic circumstances (relatedto the effects of regulated prices) indicate that use of units of revenueis a more appropriate basis of computing amortization. In the latter case,amortization shall be computed on the basis of current gross revenues (excludingroyalty payments and net profits disbursements) from production in relationto future gross revenues based on current prices (including considerationof changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements),from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves.</ITAG><T3>Question</T3>: May entities using the full cost method of accountingfor oil and gas producing activities compute amortization based on thegross revenue method described in the above rule when substantial productionis not subject to pricing regulation?<T3>Interpretive Response</T3>: Yes. Under the existing rules for costamortization adopted in Accounting Series Release No. 258,\1\<NOTE/> the use of the gross revenue method of amortization was permittedin those circumstances where, because of the effect of existing pricingregulations, the use of the units of production method would result inan amortization provision that would be inconsistent with the current pricesbeing received. While the effect of regulation on gas prices has lessened,factors other than price regulation (such as changes in typical contractlengths and methods of marketing natural gas) have caused oil and gas pricesto be disproportionate to their relative energy content. The staff thereforebelieves that it may be more appropriate for registrants to compute amortizationbased on the gross revenue method whenever oil and gas sales prices aredisproportionate to their relative energy content to the extent that theuse of the units of production method would result in an improper matchingof the costs of oil and gas production against the related revenue received.The method should be consistently applied and appropriately disclosed withinthe financial statements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 43 FR 60415 (December 27, 1978).<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>G. Inclusion of Methane Gas in Proved Reserves<T3>Facts: </T3>Because of a concern over worldwide oil and gas supplies,Congress, in 1980, provided for tax incentives (credits) for the productionof oil and gas from other than conventional sources.\2\<NOTE/> As a consequence, significant amounts of gas have begun tobe recovered from seams of coal beds. This gas is referred to as coalbedmethane. It is produced using conventional drilling methods, but for variousreasons, it may be more costly to produce than oil and gas recovered fromcustomary sources and some reserves may not be economical without the taxcredits.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Section 29 of the Federal Tax Code provides for Creditfor Producing Fuel from a Nonconventional Source.Rule 4-10(a)(1)(i)(A) of Regulation S-X indicates that oil and gas producingactivities include the search for crude oil, including condensate and naturalgas liquids, or natural gas in their natural states and original locations.Rule 4-10(a)(2)(iii)(D) of Regulation S-X states that estimates of provedreserves do not include (among other things) natural gas that can be recoveredfrom coal.\3\<NOTE/> In addition, the definition of proved oil and gas reservesincludes a provision that the quantities of natural gas be recovered fromexisting reservoirs. Under these definitions, ``coalbed methane'' gas hasgenerally not been included in the disclosures required in Commission filingsby Rule 4-10(k) of Regulation S-X. Further, coalbed methane has generallynot been counted in proved oil and gas reserves for purposes of the fullcost ceiling test in Rule 4-10(i)(4) since that test is based on the samedefinition of proved oil and gas reserves.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Similar language appears in Statement of Financial AccountingStandards No. (SFAS) 25, <T3>Suspension of Certain Accounting Requirements for Oil and Gas ProducingCompanies, </T3>and SFAS No. 19, <T3>Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies</T3>.<T3>Question: </T3>Is it appropriate to consider coalbed methane gas withinthe definition of proved reserves for purposes of the disclosures relatingto oil and gas producing activities and the full cost ceiling test?<T3>Answer: </T3>Yes. The prohibition against the inclusion of gas derivedfrom coal was meant to apply to the recovery of hydrocarbons from the processingof coal. The extraction of methane gas from coalbed seams using conventionalmethods was not contemplated at the time Rule 4-10(a) was developed. Thestaff believes that, since coalbed methane gas can be recovered from coalin its natural state and original location, it should be included in provedreserves, provided that it complies in all other respects with the definitionof proved oil and gas reserves as specified in Rule 4-10(a)(2) includingthe requirement that methane production be economical at current prices,costs (net of the tax credit) and existing operating conditions.\4\<NOTE/> Methane gas from coalbeds (like any other hydrocarbon obtainedfrom conventional reservoirs) that cannot be produced at a profit undercurrent economic and operating conditions, or for which there is no marketor any existing method of delivery to the market, cannot be included inthe category of proved reserves.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantitiesof crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological andengineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverablein future years from known reservoirs under existing <T3>economic </T3>and <T3>operating </T3>conditions. (Emphasis added.)In instances where methane gas is deemed to be economically producibleonly as a consequence of existing Federal tax incentives, the staff believesthat additional disclosure should be provided as to the specific quantitiesand values of reported proved reserves that are dependent on existing U.S.tax policy together with any other information necessary to inform readersof the risks attendant with any future change to existing Federal tax policy.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-22678 Filed 9-25-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 8010-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
