The nominaton by the leading opposition party is likely to befollowed by an endorsement from the rest of the anti-Pinochetcoalition. Pro-government forces also are expected to pick acandidate for the Dec. 14 election.   ``I trust my name will be accepted by the other parties'' in the17-party opposition coalition, Aylwin said after his unanimousnomination by the Christian Democrat's 286-delegate convention.   ``I hope we will be able to reach an agreement on a singleopposition candidate,'' said Alywin, 70. ``That's what all theparties in the opposition want.''   The 10-hour Christian Democratic gathering at the town ofTalagante, 20 miles southwest of Santiago, ended at dawn Sunday withAlywin's nomination.   The nomination was unanimous, party officials said, after atleast two other contenders withdrew from the race.   The nomination was expected to restore unity within theopposition coalition, which was badly split in the last three monthsover the choice of the presidential candidate.   The opposition coalition is to meet next month to decide on asingle presidential candidate.   Leaders from virtully all parties in the coalition, which rangesfrom the center-right to the left, had said before the conventionthat they wwere prepared to support Aylwin if he was nominated bythe Christian Democrats.   The former senator has been criticized, however, by some leftistpoliticians who say he did not oppose Pinochet's 1973 coup thattoppled the elected leftist government of President Salvador Allende.   Allende died in the coup, taking his own life, according to themilitary's version, which is now widely accepted.   Aylwin emerged as a leading national political figure as chiefspokesman for the united opposition during the campaign for lastOct. 5 referendum, in which voters rejected a military proposal toextend Pinochet's term until 1997. The opposition received 3.9million votes to Pinochet's 3.1 million.   The referendum outcome made the Dec. 14 open presidentialelection mandatory. Pinochet is barred by the Constitution to seekre-election, but the Constution still guarantees a prominent rolefor the military in running the country.   Aylwin, considered a moderate, has said the future government'spriority tasks include the trial and punishment of those responsiblefor the massive human rights violations that occurred under themilitary government.   Aylwin, a law professsor, is a seasoned politician who waspresident of the Senate before the 1973 coup.</TEXT></DOC>
