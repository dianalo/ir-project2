The move further deepens the mystery about what is going oninside Communist China's traditionally secretive leadership.   The legislature may be waiting until the Communist Party holds anexpected Central Committee meeting to formally oust party GeneralSecretary Zhao Ziyang, who has reportedly already been stripped ofpower. Qiao Shi, the party official responsible for security, hasemerged as a likely successor.   Wan Li, the chairman of the National People's Congress, hadscheduled a special session beginning Tuesday.   But a man who answered the telephone at the Congress's pressoffice said the session was postponed because Beijing has not yetreturned completely to normal. No new date was set.   Several thousand student protesters had planned to stay incentral Beijing's Tiananmen Square, outside the Great Hall of thePeople where the Congress meets, until the session began.   But they were routed out June 3-4 when troops with tanks andmachine guns shot their way through huge crowds protecting thestudents and rolled into the square. Hundreds of unarmed civilianswere killed.   The nearly 3,000-legislature normally meets just once a year,with a 135-member Standing Committee fulfilling its duties the restof the year.   It was not clear what Wan had in mind by calling the session,though discussion had been expected on how to deal with thepro-democracy movement's demands for reforms including a free pressand an end to official corruption. The congress has played asomewhat larger role in shaping legislation in recent years butstill has no say in basic policy.   The 17-member Politburo and party elders including senior leaderDeng Xiaoping hold the real reins of power.   Although Wan has a reputation as a political moderate, like othermoderates he has publicly supported the army crackdown and visitedthe troops to thank them for crushing what is now being called acounterrevolutionary rebellion.   The only top officials absent from the public eye in recent daysand believed purged are Zhao and party propaganda chief Hu Qili, whoChinese sources said opposed the crackdown.   Qiao, a Politburo member, told a meeting of non-party officialsSaturday that ``it is very natural that people have different viewsand doubts'' under the current ``complicated '' situation.   The comments, reported Sunday by the official People's Dailynewspaper, were more conciliatory than past remarks by hard-linerswho now control the Communist Party.   Two weeks after the sweep on Tiananmen Square, the militarypresence on central city streets was sharply reduced. More than 100army trucks, most filled with soldiers, drove east from the citycenter before dawn, apparently heading for bases in the suburbs.   Most of the estimated 150,000 soldiers called into Beijing toenforce martial law have returned to bases outside the city, Westerndiplomats said.   The number of soldiers guarding Tiananmen Square was cut sharplythis morning, and armored personnel carriers that had been parkedthere were gone. Pedestrians remain barred from the square.   Soldiers stood guard at only key intersections. The televisionnews said many had been sent into fields and factories to help boostproduction idled during the protests.   Workers were busy erasing traces of the battles fought in theheart of the capital. Road crews patched asphalt torn up by tanks.   However, the city retained a subdued air, with far less trafficthan usual and far fewer pedestrians. Illegal open-air labor marketswhere peasants sought work on construction crews and as maids wereshut down.   Some stores displayed red-and-yellow banners thanking the martiallaw troops for restoring order, but most people were reluctant todiscuss the crackdown at all.   ``I'm a businessman, I should talk about business,'' said oneresident.   Official Beijing Radio today announced the arrests of two moreleaders of illegal worker unions.   On Sunday, the national television news reported 10 more arrestsof protesters, including three identified as students.   More than 1,300 people have been reported arrested in the wake ofthe Beijing violence, but the pace dropped off sharply over theweekend.   Sixteen of 21 student leaders named in a wanted circular remainedat large. Among them were the three top leaders, Wang Dan and ChaiLing of Beijing University and Wu'er Kaixi of the Beijing NormalUniversity. Rumors have placed some of them in foreign embassies,but only the United States has acknowledged harboring fugitives,dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife.   A total of 11 people have been condemned to death for allegedroles in protest-related violence in Beijing and Shanghai.</TEXT></DOC>
