Barricada, the government newspaper, quoted Ortega as saying VicePresident Quayle's promise and other comments on Nicaragua were``constructive, intelligent, and not confrontational.''   Quayle told reporters in Venezuela last week that the Bushadministration was ``going to give the diplomatic route a chance''to resolve the 8-year war between the leftist Sandinista governmentand U.S.-backed rebels.   U.S. military aid to the Contras expired last year. Quaylepledged the United States will not seek more aid in order to givepeace talks a chance, according to Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.   They all were in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, attendingThursday's inauguration of President Carlos Andres Perez.   Ortega did not meet Quayle but showed a new peace proposal toformer President Carter on Wednesday.   Quayle criticized that meeting, telling reporters Thursday,``Obviously when you have a former president meeting with heads ofstate we don't meet with, it has a chance of complicating matters.''   Ortega told Barricada none of Quayle's statements contained``confrontational responses, including when (reporters) asked himabout my meeting with former President Carter.''   The United States has refused to negotiate with Nicaragua, sayingthe Sandinistas must first negotiate with their opposition.   Ortega also said Nicaragua's Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escotowill present a plan next week to the United Nations calling on theUnited States to work with Central American governments to fightdrug trafficking, the pro-government El Nuevo Diario reported.   ``It's well-known that Central America is used by the drugtraffickers as a staging ground from south to north,'' Ortega toldthe newspaper, without providing any details of the plan.   Ortega said the Feb. 13-14 summit of Central American presidentsin El Salvador would achieve tangible results for the stalled 1987Central American peace plan.   The Nicaraguan leader said he and the presidents of El Salvador,Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras expect the summit to produce``not a simple communique, but rather concrete and specificactions.''   The peace plan calls for cease-fires in Nicaragua, El Salvadorand Guatemala, political amnesties, democratization and barscountries from allowing their territory to be used by insurgentsfighting another country.</TEXT></DOC>
