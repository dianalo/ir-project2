One main goal has guided U.S. security policy since World War II: the containment of communism and its chief proponent, the Soviet Union. But that policy, tailored to the two-power world of 40 years ago, doesn't fit an era in which the Soviet Union is struggling to restructure its ossified economy, communism is in decline as an ideology, and the American public worries more about economic competition from Japan or terrorist attacks against the U.S. than superpower confrontation.    The search for a new security policy reflects the complexities of a world in which military power and economic power are more diffuse than ever, in which Iraq can nearly sink an American warship and Taiwan can run up a huge trade surplus with the U.S.    The new approach places more emphasis on responding to economic competition than on battling communism. It aims to promote positive change, such as the recent spread of democracy and market economies throughout the Third World, and even the East Bloc. And it seeks to forge new trade and security relationships with democratic allies that are economic rivals, like Japan.    &quot;Containment of the Soviet Union has succeeded,&quot; says former Defense Secretary Harold Brown. &quot;But the containment model doesn't manage all these new issues: Third World debt, sub-Saharan Africa. Clearly the world's more complicated now. In many areas of competition, it's not the Soviet Union we have to watch, but Japan, to some extent Europe, and increasingly the newly industrializing countries,&quot; such as South Korea.    The gradual redefinition of security is still in its infancy. But both presidential candidates are discussing these new security requirements, though their prescriptions for change are vague.    &quot;The interests of the world and the cause of peace are best served not merely by containing communism but by spreading freedom and democracy,&quot; says Vice President George Bush, the Republican candidate. &quot;Economic growth is now as much a matter of foreign policy as it is of monetary policy.&quot;    Gov. Michael Dukakis is striking a similar note. &quot;I believe the greatest challenge of the next decade will be economic,&quot; he says. &quot;In military security, NATO has served us well. Our postwar economic institutions and arrangements have fared less well.&quot;    Because aspects of the emerging new policy have already taken root in the rhetoric of both parties, the next president stands a chance of establishing a more genuinely bipartisan foreign policy than the country has seen in two decades.    Change won't be easy. The new president will have to restructure national security policy-making. Today, economic and security decisions move on separate tracks. The evolving policy will require greater coordination. In addition, many of today's problems -- terrorism and exchange-rate volatility, for example -- require synchronized international responses. So the new administration is likely to spend more time in multilateral negotiations.    At the same time, the next president will need to find a way to replace containment without neglecting Soviet military and diplomatic threats. The U.S. must also dig itself out of its trade deficit and debtor status if it is to lead as strongly in the new world order as it has in the old one. And after 20 years of foreign-policy discord, it will be difficult to restore bipartisanship in foreign policy.    Nevertheless, the country is moving toward a new model of national security. Several gradual but important changes are prompting a re-evaluation of the nation's international interests:   --The Soviet Union poses a serious military threat, but it doesn't compete seriously with the West in other ways. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's current drive to reform his economy highlights the failings of communism. Around the world, developing nations are looking to capitalist countries for inspiration and money.    --Because of Moscow's achievement of nuclear parity with the U.S., a balance of terror exists that makes an all-out nuclear arms race seem less attractive to both superpowers.    --There has been a growing awareness in the U.S. that communism isn't the root of all the nation's international problems. In recent years, falling right-wing dictators, such as the shah of Iran and Nicaraguan boss Anastasio Somoza, have caused the U.S. more grief than rising left-wing ones.    --Since the Vietnam War, containment has stopped being a unifying force in domestic politics. Disputes between Congress and the White House over such issues as aiding anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua have shattered the foreign-policy accord of the 1950s.    --While the U.S.S.R. remains America's chief military rival, the diffusion of military technology threatens U.S. interests from new directions. Instead of facing Soviet tanks in Berlin, U.S. forces have been attacked by French-made Iraqi missiles in the Persian Gulf. A lone Iranian-trained terrorist killed more Americans -- 241 -- in a single morning in Beirut than Soviet soldiers ever have.    --Most important, the postwar American economic hegemony has been replaced by a much more competitive world economy. Americans increasingly see this economic competition from capitalist allies as more threatening to their well-being than communism.    &quot;Militarily, we're stronger internationally than we were, but economically we're weaker,&quot; says Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, a close adviser to Mr. Dukakis. &quot;And the economic side may be more important.&quot; He says a solution to the Third World debt problem, for instance, would improve national security by promoting democracy and economic reform and encouraging stability in Mexico and elsewhere.    On the other side of the political spectrum, outgoing Treasury Secretary James Baker says, &quot;The scope of the national-security debate has been broadened to include the economic dimension. And I think the reason for that is that the economic domination of the United States, which has long been taken for granted, is to some extent now being questioned.&quot;    Those looking for a new definition of U.S. security often note that the U.S. has lost the military and economic dominance it had in the early 1950s, when the world was recovering from World War II. But few go as far as Yale historian Paul Kennedy, who argues in &quot;The Decline and Fall of Great Powers&quot; that the U.S. may even be starting an inevitable decline. Most specialists contend that the U.S. is still the first among equals -- at least as powerful militarily as the Soviet Union and twice as large economically as Japan. Only the U.S. enjoys this dual advantage.    &quot;We have less of the world's power than we had 30 years ago,&quot; says Mr. Brown. &quot;But in absolute terms we're not on the way down. If we are on the way down, it's not clear who's on the way up. Could we be satisfied with the kind of power Japan wields in the world? Or with the one-dimensional Soviet influence? I don't think so.&quot;    The departing Reagan administration may represent the last gasp of the containment theory. Its chief national-security efforts have been a big military buildup and counterattacks against Communist beachheads in the Third World.    The Reagan containment has hardly been impotent. Even critics acknowledge that U.S. support of anti-Communist forces pressured the Soviet Union to withdraw from Afghanistan and that the president's military buildup and Star Wars space defense plan have encouraged Moscow to be more forthcoming on arms control.    Yet the federal budget squeeze during the Reagan years has forced deep cuts in economic aid abroad, reducing U.S. influence. And the Reagan policies have, until recently, ignored the fundamental economic power shifts in the world. Over the past eight years, the administration has plunged the U.S. into debt and trade deficits, permitted the Third World debt burden to fester, and failed to craft a coherent overall policy toward America's greatest economic competitor, Japan.    Those tasks will land on the desk of Mr. Reagan's successor. The most politically sensitive of them will be managing trade relations with Japan and the other nations that followed the U.S. economic model successfully enough to become America's commercial rivals and creditors.    Existing trade laws, which entail case-by-case, product-by-product disputes, often lock the U.S. into angry confrontations that never seem to end. In both political parties, there is talk of rethinking trade agreements and of finding a way for other economic powers to pick up some of the cost of trade initiatives.    Mr. Baker says that the rise of protectionist sentiment against the Japanese will force any new president &quot;to keep up the pressure on them to open their markets.&quot; Since he clinched the U.S.-Canada free-trade pact last year, Mr. Baker has argued that the U.S. should consider similar treaties with its other major trading partners, either one at a time or in small groups. This idea partly reflects the fear that the plodding, 90-nation world trade talks now under way won't go far enough or fast enough.    &quot;If you can't get it done multilaterally, you get it done bilaterally,&quot; he says. &quot;Why? Because domestic political support for free trade won't accommodate years and years of delay.&quot;    The Treasury secretary, who forged Western cooperation on currency rates and economic policy, adds that such pacts also could help resolve the problem of &quot;burden-sharing&quot; -- who pays how much for such items as common defense and economic aid to developing nations.    &quot;Burden-sharing is more than the number of troops and planes,&quot; Mr. Baker says. &quot;We need to consider the economic factor. For too long in the U.S. we have thought of it as strictly a national-security issue, with no economic component. But those days are gone. You can't argue that way with a guy in Congress whose urban grant you're trying to phase out to support pre-positioning of more U.S. troops in South Korea, when the Koreans are running up a big trade surplus with us.&quot;    Former Defense Secretary Brown suggests that it may be in the U.S. interest to create a sort of economic NATO to help share the burdens and settle on trade rules. &quot;We need to try to come to some sort of economic equivalent of the alliance policies,&quot; he says.    But Mr. Brown concedes that working out such alliances won't be easy. &quot;Unlike with NATO, there's no external threat; the rivalries are within. Against whom are we going to form an economic alliance with Japan? The Martians? So it will be even harder than NATO was, a peculiar combination of trying to negotiate the formation of NATO and arms control at the same time.&quot;    Nevertheless, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Dukakis are hinting that new economic agreements are needed. Both favor a free-trade deal with Mexico. The vice president has talked vaguely of reaching some new broad agreement with Japan. And the governor has proposed an equally vague &quot;alliance for global growth.&quot;    Another looming quandary is how to help developing nations in the face of crushing debts to Western banks and Third World fears of big-power exploitation. There is a growing convergence of opinion that U.S. national security will depend in large part on fostering democracy and private economies in the Third World. But the two candidates take sharply different views of how to do that.    Mr. Baker and Mr. Bush strongly back the so-called Baker Plan, the constantly evolving set of principles for managing Third World debt through new loans from banks and world institutions, and voluntarily negotiated financing arrangements. Mr. Baker notes that without resorting to any sweeping debt bailout, the administration has presided over the march of democracy and the rise of open-market economics in much of the Third World.    Brazil and Argentina have become democracies. Mexico has privatized hundreds of industries. In Pakistan, the leftist opposition leader Benazir Bhutto talks eagerly about restoring private control to state-run industries, a policy her father, the country's late Socialist leader, would abhor.    But Sen. Bradley argues that the Reagan team hasn't done enough to resolve the debt crisis. He has proposed a government-run international program that would offer actual reductions in debt costs to countries that adopt economic reforms and open up their markets. Mr. Dukakis has endorsed this general approach.    &quot;The debt issue has given an opening to the Soviets in Latin America,&quot; the senator says. &quot;If you ever wanted to give left-wing demagogues a tool with which to beat back incipient democracies and market-oriented economies, it's the debt to U.S. banks. Every dollar Mexico pays to American banks is a dollar they don't invest at home, a dollar they don't spend buying U.S. exports.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis promises to try to get America's economic rivals to help finance Third World development. &quot;Everyone talks about burden-sharing. To some, it means Japanese submarines prowling the Indian Ocean,&quot; he says. &quot;But more important to me would be more yen and deutschemarks helping Cory Aquino to build land reform in the Philippines; helping Raul Alfonsin to translate democracy into opportunity in Argentina.&quot; This heightened financial involvement by U.S. allies could lead to new power -- or new perils -- for foreign banks and trading companies, a further sign of the diffusion of economic power.    The U.S. may still be in a unique position to lead in the world. But it will take patience, confidence and tolerance for any new national-security strategy to evolve and work. After more than 40 years of containing an enemy, the next administration faces the challenge of drawing up a security policy directed more at shared leadership in a world of powerful friends.    ---                  Changing Balance of Power    U.S. economic power in the world has shrunk . . .                                         1950        1986    Share of world exports               17.2%       10.9%    Share of world's monetary reserves   50.1%        8.8%    Share of world's gold reserves       68.2%       27.6%    And military power has been diffused . . .
