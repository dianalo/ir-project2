The sale will mark the first privatization operation since October, when the stock-market crash forced the government to interrupt its ambitious plan to sell 26 banking, industrial and insurance groups to the public by 1991. Government officials said the resumption of the program demonstrates the government's confidence that the stock market has stabilized.    But the officials cautioned that the Matra operation is small, and said that they don't now plan any large-scale sales before the April presidential election.    The government had planned to float Matra in late October but canceled the operation only days before its scheduled launch. In a television interview two weeks ago, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said if he resumed the privatization program, he would begin with Matra.    Under the Matra sale, the government will sell only 18.8% of the company's shares, valued at less than one billion French francs ($176.8 million), directly to the public. It will sell an additional 22% to a group of stable shareholders who will have to pay a 10% premium on the issue price. Matra's staff will be offered 4.5% of the shares at preferential rates, and the state will retain 5.8% for a free share distribution later. The rest is already traded on the market.    The issue price and names of the stable shareholders will be announced today; Matra trading was suspended yesterday pending the sale. But based on Matra's closing price Friday of 1,465 francs ($258.95) a share, the shares should be priced at about 120 francs each, because Matra plans to divide its shares by 12 before the sale, which lasts through Jan. 27.    Matra has interests in defense, space, electronics, telecommunications and transport. The French government, which considers Matra as vital to national interest, will exercise its so-called golden share, allowing it to veto stakes exceeding 10%.    Analysts said the sale is important because the government has staked much political capital on the privatization program and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, who announced his presidential candidacy this weekend, is keen to put the program back on track. </TEXT></DOC>
