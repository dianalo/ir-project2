Troops laid metal sheets on park lawns to protect the grass. Evenso, the owner of Hyde Park's exclusive horse stable complained thatdrivers turned a 300-year-old riding path laid by King William ofOrange into a race track, causing serious damage.   A one-day walkout by bus maintenance crews disrupted services onthe capital's red double-deckers, which carry 3.2 million peopledaily. Trains and subways carry nearly 5 million.   The government made wartime-like appeals to people to share carsand bring them in only when strictly necessary.   A windswept Mrs. Thatcher sped down the River Thames in a PortAuthority launch to open the new Design Museum at Butler's Wharf onthe river's south bank near Tower Bridge.   ``I just think it's a tragedy the public are being put to all ofthis trouble to get to work,'' she said.   Transport Minister Paul Channon, who took a bus instead of hisofficial limousine to work, said: ``a lot of people have been makingsuperhuman efforts to get to work today in London and in othercities.''   Mrs. Thatcher's administration said it was prepared for what asenior government source called ``a war of attrition'' withincreasingly militant unions.   As the latest one-day strike hit, British Rail announced a record$486 million profit, achieved despite reduced subsidies thatfollowed the government announcement it would sell the system toprivate enterprise.   British Rail said the profit was for reinvestment, not payincreases.   John Prescott, the transport spokesman for the opposition LaborParty, declared: ``The government has to end its obsession withprivatization and the free market before congestion and overcrowdingreduce our transport system to total chaos.''   Troops laid metal sheeting over grass in Hyde Park and Regent'sPark to provide 7,000 extra parking spaces for motorists whonormally would take public transportation to work.   Richard Briggs, owner of the Hyde Park stable, said somemotorists damaged a riding path put down in 1689. ``I want to knowwho's going to pay for it,'' he said.   Huge traffic jams were reported in the morning and afternoon onsome routes, but hundreds of commuters walked, jogged or cycled towork. Passenger ferries on the River Thames reported brisk business.   The employers' Confederation of British Industry said the turnoutfor work appeared slightly less than the estimated 75 percent ofLondoners who made it during the last strike on June 28.   The 75,000-member National Union of Railwaymen has held weeklyone-day strikes to coincide with walkouts that began three monthsago by the London Underground's 10,500 employees.   The railworkers, who want a 10 percent pay increase, haverejected a 7 percent offer. The union also demands an end to amanagement attempt to negotiate separately with different categoriesof workers, weakening the national union's power to halt the system.   The subway workers want a $101-a-week raise for operating trainswithout a guard. Management has offered $47 plus 14 days extravacation, with the package tied to increased productivity.   In mounting industrial unrest, the 17-union Confederation ofShipbuilding and Engineering Unions announced Wednesday it will pollworkers at selected companies about holding indefinite strikes. Thefederation, which covers 2 million workers, wants the 39-hourworking week cut to 35 hours.   On Tuesday, a strike by the 500,000-member National Associationof Local Government Officers disrupted public services run by localauthorities, such as mortuaries and museums.</TEXT></DOC>
