Reich, a former Wall Street lawyer toppled in the Dennis Levine insider-trading case.    Although the 32-year-old Mr. Reich didn't actually trade securities, he was sentenced to prison by Judge Robert W. Sweet, who said he was jailing a &quot;brilliant&quot; former takeover lawyer as a deterrent.    Mr. Reich, who sobbed quietly at his sentencing in federal court here Friday, also was put on probation for five years. Society's &quot;rules must be obeyed,&quot; particularly by lawyers, the judge said.    Mr. Reich was a highly regarded partner at the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen andamp; Katz, one of Wall Street's busiest takeover advisers. He lost his license to practice law because he pleaded guilty in October to passing confidential information from Wachtell Lipton about a dozen pending business transactions to Mr. Levine, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. managing director who the government says made $12.6 million trading in stocks using inside information from various sources.    Three individuals now have been punished in the Levine case, which ultimately led to the government's $100 million settlement with and pending criminal prosecution of Ivan F. Boesky on one felony count related to securities-law violations.    Mr. Reich's 366-day prison sentence surprised lawyers because it came 11 days after investment banker David S. Brown received a much lighter term, from a different judge, of 30 days to be served on weekends. Mr. Reich, like Mr. Brown, was highly praised by former colleagues in letters to the sentencing judge. Unlike Mr. Brown, Mr. Reich hadn't actually made any money on the scheme, although the government said that he at one time had an arrangement to receive part of Mr. Levine's illegal profit.    Ira B. Sokolow, a former Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. investment banker, earlier received the same year-and-a-day sentence as Mr. Reich. Mr. Sokolow received $85,000 from Mr. Levine for his information, and Mr. Brown received $27,500, the government said.    &quot;You have suffered quite enough for the tormented acts you committed,&quot; the judge told Mr. Reich. But &quot;a breach of trust at this level . . . requires a jail term,&quot; he said.    Mr. Reich, who had maintained his composure at his October arraignment, struggled Friday morning as he told the judge he was ashamed for betraying his former clients and his family. &quot;I feel shattered every time I think of these things,&quot; he said. &quot;I assure you I will never again do anything unlawful.&quot;    His attorney, Robert Morvillo, said his client had shown more remorse than most insider traders, though Mr. Morvillo played down insider trading as &quot;largely a victimless crime&quot; that the Securities and Exchange Commission nonetheless has been treating harshly. Mr. Morvillo said that his client is paying $485,000 to settle related SEC charges and that Mr. Reich now has &quot;no assets to speak of.&quot; In addition, Mr. Morvillo said, Mr. Reich &quot;has lost his status as a superstar lawyer.&quot;    While Judge Sweet noted Mr. Reich's remorse -- in fact, he urged that Mr. Reich eventually be reinstated as a lawyer -- he added that insider traders sap the integrity of the stock market. Mr. Reich &quot;betrayed . . . all of us,&quot; the judge said.    Mr. Reich and his attorney declined to comment on the sentence.    Mr. Reich cooperated with the SEC and the U.S. attorney's office after his guilty plea but hadn't any new information to offer on the Levine case, according to Charles M. Carberry, assistant U.S. attorney.    In a pre-sentencing letter to Judge Sweet, prosecutors urged a prison term. Mr. Carberry said the probationary sentence for insider trading given to another Wachtell Lipton partner, Carlo Florentino, in 1982, had evidently failed to deter other Wachtell Lipton employees from insider trading. &quot;It is clear that even when close to home the stigma of a felony conviction alone is not enough to curtail the temptation for easy money to be derived from misappropriated information,&quot; the letter stated.    A Wachtell Lipton spokesman said the firm hadn't any comment on the sentencing. </TEXT></DOC>
