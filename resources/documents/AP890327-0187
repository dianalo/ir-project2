All the while, there is the Nazispecter and the fear that history could repeat itself.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</NOTE><NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Historian Karl-Dietrich Bracher likesto compare West Germany to a young man just out of college, shakive parentsand plunging headlong into a world full ofopportunity and danger.   Youthfully ingoff protectvibrant and economically strong, West Germany has letgo of the apron strings of the United States, which gave itpolitical guidance and physical nourishment in the first hard yearsof a statehood founded on the ruins of the Third Reich.   Now engaged in a flirtation with the Kremlin that its elders inthe NATO alliance fear may be a naive or dangerous courtship, thenation has been rebelling against the familial bounds of blocdiplomacy and the burdens of a shared deGermans on both sides of the borderthat reunification is stillpossible. But West Germans concede the prospects are slim as timeheals the wound of separation and a new generation with no memoryof one Germany becomes the majority in both states.   The future holds out little hope of improvement for EastGermans. The socialist leadership of Erich Honecker has failed toembrace either the social or economic reforms championed by Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Honecker maintains that a wholesale revamping of the typeGorbachev espouses with his ``perestroika,'' or rebuilding project,is unnecessary in East Germany because of his nation's relativesuccess among the socialist states.   The 76-year-old Honecker, reported at times to be in ill healthbut showing no signs of an intent to bow out as head of theSocialist Unity Party, dismisses suggestions of a unified Germanyas an unrealistic refusal to deal with the political facts.   He has also dashed hopes that East Germany in the age ofGorbachev and glasnost might be willing to dismantle the BerlinWall that Western leaders have labeled an anachronism of the ColdWar.   Responding to appeals during a recent Vienna human rightsconference that the wall be torn down, Honecker declared it wouldstand another 50 or 100 years, as long as the differences dividingEast and West demand it.   The wall was erected in 1961 to stop the flood of East Germansseeking refuge in the West.   ``Contrary to its intention, it is daily proof that the questionit tried to answer remains unanswered,'' West German PresidentRichard von Weizsaecker has said. ``It makes the idea of belongingtogether conspicuous, an idea which it sought to make us forget.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 9</NOTE></DOC>
