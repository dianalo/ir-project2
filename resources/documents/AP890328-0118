The losers in balloting for a new national parliament included acandidate member of the ruling Politburo, the premiers of Latviaand Lithuania, and 27 Communist Party leaders from major cities,regions and republics, according to results obtained frominterviews and various press reports.   The humiliation was greatest for officials who ran unopposed onthe ballot and still lost because more than 50 percent of thevoters crossed out their names.   Activists in cities from Leningrad to Kiev waged ``cross-out''campaigns urging citizens to vote against certain officials byblacking out their names on the ballots.   Izvestia reported Tuesday what it called the ``sensational''result that no one was elected in 168 electoral districts wherethere were only one or two candidates because so many citizensvoted against them.   In the weeks prior to the election, activists carried posters inKiev illustrating ballots with several names crossed out. UkrainianCommunist Party chief Vladimir Shcherbitsky won anyway, but votersrejected both the party chief and the mayor of Kiev. All three ranunopposed.   In Leningrad, Deputy Mayor Alexei Bolshakov also lost despitefacing no opposition. Scraps of hand-made posters appearedthroughout the city in recent weeks suggesting he be defeated forthat reason alone, according to a resident.   The defeat of so many top Communist Party and governmentofficials was seen as a blow to the establishment, but ForeignMinistry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Tuesday that 80percent of the party's candidates had won.   Although those rejected for seats in the new Congress ofPeople's Deputies retain their current positions, Gerasimov saidlocal party organizations will examine the losses and decide theirfuture.   ``Maybe they were wrong for their posts,'' he said. ``Maybe theyfailed to advertise their platforms. Every case should be takenseparately.''   In Lithuania, where voters rejected the Baltic republic'spresident, premier, two vice premiers, the planning commissionchairman, the minister of justice, five party officials and amayor, local media questioned whether the Council of Ministers andPresidium should be dissolved ``in light of the people's lack oftrust.''   Lithuanian Council of Ministers spokesman Cheslovas Jurshenas,responding to that question at a press briefing, said only that theelection was for the national parliament and did not concern theofficials' posts in the government of the republic.   Despite intense interest, most election results have yet to bereported in Soviet media. Tuesday night's television news did notmention any specific races.   Run-off elections are scheduled April 9 for districts in whichcandidates failed to win more than 50 percent of the vote. But itwas not clear how soon there could be new nominations and entirelynew elections in the districts where voters rejected one or bothcandidates.   Human rights activist Andrei Sakharov is expected to benominated next week as a candidate from the Academy of Sciences,where only eight of 23 contenders received 50 percent of the voteson the first round. The academy has 20 guaranteed seats in the newcongress.   Although a number of the winners are progressives from insideand outside the party, it is not clear if they will constitute asignificant force on the 2,250-member Congress of People'sDeputies, or on the approximately 500-member working parliament tobe chosen from among the deputies.   Nor is it clear if the newcomers will find common issues tounite them.   But Virgilijus Chepaitis, a leader of the political reform groupSajudis, which swept the Lithuanian elections, said he believesone-third of the new deputies will be progressives dedicated toliberalizing the political and economic system of the Soviet Union.   Chepaitis also raised the possibility that deputies wouldquickly form coalitions to enhance their political power. Hespecifically suggested that the Baltic republics of Lithuania,Latvia and Estonia might find common interests with the smallerautonomous regions inside the huge Russian republic.   Boris Yeltsin, the former Moscow party chief who campaigned foran end to special privileges of the party elite, swept to an 89percent victory in the parliamentary district encompassing all ofthe capital. After his win, he left for a month's vacation.</TEXT></DOC>
