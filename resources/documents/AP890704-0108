Rosa Maria Abierno assaying.   She said she used an unidentified ``commercial contact to startthe trafficking of drugs'' into Florida.   Ms. Abierno said the operation was authorized by Col. Antonio dela Guardia Font, an officer of a secret Interior Ministry divisionthat smuggled goods to circumvent a U.S. economic embargo, which wasdeclared in the 1960s on President Fidel Castro's government.   ``With the operation authorized, we proceeded to ship the cocainecamouflaged inside computers for a value of $300,000 into the UnitedStates,'' Ms. Abierno was quoted as saying. She said she coordinatedthree such operations.   Cuba does not manufacture computers and the dispatch did not sayfrom where they originated.   Ms. Abierno testified on her own behalf Monday night, shortlybefore the court recessed in its third day of hearings in Havana.She was the only woman among 15 people on trial for high treason,smuggling and corruption.   Those charged included Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, a hero of Cubanmilitary expeditions to civil wars in Angola and Ethiopia, andformer Interior Minister Jose Abrantes. All were stripped of rankand decorations last week and dishonorably discharged by a militarycourt of honor, which recommended they be tried by court-martial.   They face execution by firing squad if found guilty.   The news agency dispatches, monitored in Mexico City, identifiedMs. Abierno as a ``very active coordinator'' from 1987 to 1989 indrug trafficking.   She bought a house and a car with her share from the smugglingoperations, Prensa Latina said. It said authorities confiscated$14,000 in cash when they arrested her.   Authorities confiscated $1.2 million, 39 luxury cars, amotorcycle and 186 firearms when they arrested them, the dispatchessaid.   Under cross-examination by prosecutors on Sunday, Ochoa said hetook up drug smuggling to earn dollars to help Cuba's strainedeconomy.   Among those on trial are de la Guardia's twin brother, Brig. Gen.Patricio de la Guardia, and Capt. Miguel Ruiz, two of Ochoa's closeaides.   Prensa Latina said testimony also accused the defendants ofallowing shiploads of contraband marijuana from Jamaica and hundredsof pounds of cocaine to pass through Cuban territorial waters andairspace into Florida. They are also accused of dealing in diamondsand ivory.</TEXT></DOC>
