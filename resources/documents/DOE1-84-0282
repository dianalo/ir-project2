Participation of the citizensand its educating effect in the forming of public opinion is welcometo a democratic system, but the tendency to generalise conflicts bearsthe risk to engender conflicts on competence. Given the declining acceptanceof licensing decisions taken by the executive, there is apparent needfor modifying the administrative procedure. Existing means and rightsof participation are not such to be combined to a suitable system. Dueto the different substantive law conditions in the various subject fieldsthey sometimes have a polarizing effect, so that the theory of participationsupporting consensus cannot be maintained. The book in hand presentsa few proposals for improvement towards more 'rightness' and acceptanceof administrative decisions. (orig./HSCH).</TEXT></DOC>
