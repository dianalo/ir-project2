They cheated on their taxes. They plannedrevolutions. They used their positions for personal gain. Theythreatened to jail their critics.   Impeachment is the process provided by the Constitution by whichCongress can remove public officials for misconduct. These includefederal judges, who cannot be fired because they have lifetimeappointments.   The House has adopted impeachment articles for only 15officials, including U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings ofMiami, who was impeached on Wednesday by a 413-3 vote.   Impeachment is the equivalent of an indictment, and sends thecase to the Senate for trial. The House acts by majority vote, buta two-thirds vote is required for conviction by the Senate andremoval from office.   The impeachment process has involved victims of politicalintrigue as well as genuine scoundrels.   The last case ended in October 1986, when the Senate ousted U.S.District Judge Harry E. Claiborne of Las Vegas in the firstimpeachment trial in 50 years. Claiborne was serving a prison termfor tax evasion, but had refused to resign and continued to drawhis salary.   President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House in 1868,after running afoul of Radical Republicans in Congress during thetroubled period after the Civil War. He escaped Senate convictionby one vote.   Judge George W. English of Illinois resigned before hisscheduled impeachment trial, and his case was dismissed. The Househad accused English in 1926 of profanely denouncing state and localofficial in open court, and telling jurors they would be jailed ifa particular defendant was not convicted.   Officials can be impeached under the Constitution for ``treason,bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''   The first two offenses are easy to recognize. But ``high crimesand misdemeanors'' are more ambiguous. Although they may not becriminal offenses, they generally involve conduct that underminesthe U.S. government's integrity.   Twelve of the 15 defendants impeached by the House have beenjudges. The others were a U.S. senator, a secretary of war andJohnson.   There have been 12 Senate trials. Two defendants resigned priorto Senate action, and the remaining case is that of Hastings.   The first impeachment case was brought against Sen. WilliamBlount of Tennessee. A former commissioner of Indian affairs, hewas accused of trying to organize Indians and frontiersmen as partof a pro-British armed attack on Spanish territory.   Blount was acquitted in 1799 on grounds that a senator is notsubject to impeachment. But by then, the Senate had alreadyexpelled Blount by a 25-1 vote.   A fellow Tennessean, federal judge West H. Humphreys, wasn't solucky with his revolution.   He was convicted by a 38-0 vote in 1862, because he, ``alongwith other evil-minded persons,'' supported his state's secessionfrom the Union.   In 1803, the House charged Judge John Pickering of New Hampshirewith permitting delivery of a ship to a claimant while U.S. agentswere trying to condemn the vessel and its cargo for customsviolations.   But another impeachment charge told the real story. It describedthe judge as ``a man of loose morals and intemperate habits,'' whoappeared on the bench ``in a state of intoxication ... and therefrequently, in a most profane and indecent manner, (invoked) thename of the Supreme Being.''   The Senate convicted Pickering in 1804 after his son testifiedthat the judge had been ``wholly deranged'' with a disorder that``has baffled all medical aid.''   On the day of Pickering's conviction, the House voted its onlyimpeachment of a Supreme Court justice, Samuel Chase. The Senatesubsequently acquitted Chase of charges that he violated adefendant's rights in a treason trial.   War Secretary William W. Belknap's impeachment in 1876 followedcongressional investigations of corruption in the Grantadministration.   Belknap quit just hours before the House charged him with takingbribe money for the appointment of a military post trader, but theSenate proceeded with a trial anyway.   A majority of senators _ but fewer than the necessary two-thirds_ voted for conviction on all four charges. However, 22 senatorssaid they voted for acquittal only because they believed Belknap'sresignation should have ended the case.   Others impeached by the House:   -Judge James H. Peck of Missouri in 1830 on charges stemmingfrom his handling of a land claims case. He was acquitted by theSenate, 22-21.   _Judge Mark Delahay in 1873. The House contended his ``personalhabits unfitted him for the judicial office, that he wasintoxicated off the bench as well as on the bench.'' He resignedafter the House vote, and the case ended.   -Judge Charles Swayne of Florida in 1904. Charged withsubmitting false expense accounts, among other things, he wasacquitted on all counts by the Senate.   -Judge Robert Archbald of Pennsylvania in 1912. He was convictedby the Senate on five impeachment articles. Charges includedobtaining credit from litigants, attempting to influence legalactions before the Interstate Commerce Commission for a financialconsideration and using his judgeship to enter into profitablebusiness deals.   -Judge Harold Louderback of California, impeached in 1933 oncharges he showed favoritism in bankruptcy cases. He was acquittedby the Senate.   _Judge Halsted L. Ritter of Florida, impeached in 1936 andconvicted by the Senate. The House accused Ritter of dramaticallyincreasing the fee received by a former law partner whom the judgehad appointed as a receiver in a bankruptcy case. Ritter also wascharged with failing to pay income taxes for two years.</TEXT></DOC>
