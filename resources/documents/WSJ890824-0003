In just the past two days, many of the thrifts offering the highest yields across the country have lowered their deposit rates by at least 25 basis points (a basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point), according to Noberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote Money Markets, a New York firm that tracks rates. Some insolvent thrifts, which are just starting to receive lower-cost funds from the federal government because of the legislation, have dropped their deposit rates as much as 50 to 65 basis points, and have stopped buying high-priced brokered deposits.    In contrast, most large banks have slightly increased their deposit rates in the past three weeks.    Bids for deposits in the money markets yesterday showed &quot;a clear impact of the new bailout plan, in terms of rate reduction,&quot; Mr. Mehl said.    That's good news for the thrift industry and for the Resolution Trust Corp., the new government agency charged with disposing of broke Sandamp;Ls. If thrifts can eliminate just half of the premium they have to pay in comparison with commercial banks, their core earnings could jump 25% to 50% or more, and the Resolution Trust Corp. will have an easier time peddling the insolvent institutions to acquirers.    &quot;It's happening. It's exciting,&quot; says William Gibson, the normally reserved president of American Federal Bank of Dallas.    But the trend spells an eventual end to the bargains offered to depositors by both desperate and healthy thrifts, and a sharp reduction in business for the brokers who helped those depositors find the highest yields.    &quot;There's hardly any Texas premium left,&quot; moans William Goldsmith, a deposit broker and president of Professional Asset Securities Inc. in Solana Beach, Calif. What's worse, he adds, some of his best clients, thrifts under Resolution Trust conservatorship, have taken themselves off his marketing list in the past several days, apparently because they have been able to tap the government corporation's coffers.    He won't name them, but two obvious beneficiaries of Resolution Trust funds are University Savings of Houston and Gill Savings of Hondo, Texas, two of the biggest basket cases under government control, and perpetually among the highest bidders for deposits. As of Monday, University dropped its rates on certificates of deposit to 8.25% across the board. Six-month CDs had been 8.75%. Gill has decreased its rates for large six-month CDs to 8.75% from 9.4% since Aug. 1.    The trend at Gill and University reflects infusions of Resolution Trust deposits, says William Roelle, the director of the agency's division of resolutions and operations. So far, the trust has plowed $921 million into 11 thrifts, replacing high-cost brokered deposits with money having an initial rate of 8.79%. That rate may be reduced soon, because rates offered by healthy institutions are starting to fall as competition from insolvent ones fades. The trust doesn't want to price its deposits lower than normal retail rates.    The impact of the trust's actions will soon accelerate, because the agency plans to deposit as much as $15 billion by the end of September in the highest-yielding thrifts in its conservatorship program. Mr. Roelle says sharp rate drops can be expected at these institutions, but cautions that &quot;it will take time to see the impact on everybody's cost of funds.&quot; Moreover, there are about 350 troubled or weak Sandamp;Ls that aren't in conservatorship, and may need to bid for deposits to maintain liquidity.    But thrift experts are betting that the national impact will be significant -- and long-lasting -- because the thrift rescue is having positive effects other than the Resolution Trust's infusion. Most Sandamp;Ls can't grow much because of new capital restrictions, so demand for deposits is very weak. Also, many depositors, reassured by the bill's passage, are flocking back to troubled thrifts, without demanding a high premium.    MeraBank of Phoenix, Ariz., for instance, has dropped its six-month CD rate to 8.55% from 9.8% in the past three weeks. Five of its biggest Arizona competitors are in conservatorship, and are under marching orders from the trust to decrease rates as aggressively as the market allows. Meanwhile, depositors appear to have relaxed, after making heavy withdrawals from MeraBank when some of its financial problems were disclosed several months ago.    &quot;I don't think the RTC has pumped any money in, but things have begun to subside because the public realizes the (rescue) has the full faith and credit of the government behind it,&quot; says Gene Rice, MeraBank's chairman.    Similarly, Gibraltar Savings of Beverly Hills, Calif., has stopped offering to top its competitors' deposit rates by a full percentage point. It experienced a run on deposits when its insolvency became apparent earlier this year, but has since entered conservatorship, restored its deposit base to the 1988 level and sold some assets to increase liquidity.    Gibraltar, Merabank and at least one-third of the rest of the thrift industry have greatly reduced or even stopped mortgage lending because of their lack of real capital. They won't have any great need for new deposits until they have been bought by strong companies or laboriously rebuilt their capital position.    Apart from some pockets of high demand for deposits by certain troubled or restructuring thrifts, &quot;there will be a secular decline in demand for CDs&quot; by Sandamp;Ls, predicts Richard Pratt, chairman of Merrill Lynch's Capital Markets Group.    Healthy or recapitalized thrifts are already benefiting. &quot;We're starting to see some positive effects from the bill,&quot; says James Montgomery, chairman of one of Gibraltar's most direct competitors, Great Western Savings of Beverly Hills. Because of weak loan demand and because &quot;we're seeing more sanity in the marketplace,&quot; Great Western has recently been driving deposit rates down by five to 10 basis points each week, while giant World Savings of Oakland, Calif., has been reducing rates by 10 to 15 basis points.    Kenneth Thorn, president of United Savings Association of Texas, a thrift that was recapitalized last year by a group led by Lewis Ranieri, says his thrift has been aggressively reducing its rates, managing since late July to cut in half the premium it pays over the yield offered by large Texas banks. &quot;The psychology of the marketplace has changed,&quot; he says.    One result of that change is that United's interest spread has improved by 45 to 50 basis points, Mr. Thorn says, increasing profitability. If the whole portfolio reprices at current rates, that would mean an additional $5 million a year in net income, he estimates. &quot;Nobody was making money at the old rates,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
