Michael S. Dukakis, batteredby political and personal crises since his failed presidentialcampaign, met with soon-to-be Democratic Party chief Ronald Brownbut quickly brushed aside questions about his political future.   ``Right now, I want to do everything I can to do the best job Ican to be governor of Massachusetts on a full-time basis,'' Dukakissaid when asked about a possible presidential run in 1992. ``We'vegot a lot to do.''   Questions about Dukakis' political future followed a privatemeeting he had with Brown, who is expected to be selected partychairman Friday by the Democratic National Committee.   ``Once you're the party's nominee, (maintaining a nationalpolitical presence is) something that's expected of you,'' Dukakissaid. ``But I also know that my first and most important challenge''is the fiscal problems in Massachusetts.   Brown, a former aide to the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Sen. Edward M.Kennedy, D-Mass., has faced the same problem that hounded Dukakisthroughout the presidential campaign _ criticism he is too liberal.Dukakis defended Brown, saying he would ``make a fine'' partychairman.   The governor faces severe state budget problems at home and thisweek revealed that his wife, Kitty, was admitted for alcohol abuseat a Newport, R.I., clinic following a letdown from the presidentialloss.   Asked about the toll an unsuccessful presidential campaign takeson a family, a subdued Dukakis said: ``It's about as tough asanybody in life has to go through.''   Massachusetts colleagues indicated that the political and familyproblems are taking their toll on Dukakis.   ``Obviously he has his mind in Newport, Rhode Island,'' said Sen.John F. Kerry, D-Mass., after the state's congressional delegationhad lunch with Dukakis in the office of Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass.   ``Personally and politically, these are very tough times. He'shandling them as best he can,'' said Rep. Chester G. Atkins,D-Mass., chairman of the state party. ``Right now he has his eye onthe job in front of him, and it's an enormous task,'' Atkins said,referring to the state's budget woes.   After meeting with Brown, Dukakis spent the day on Capitol Hill.He scheduled meetings with his former running mate, Senate FinanceChairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., and Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.,chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee ontelecommunications and finance, to discuss corporate takeovers.   Dukakis, who pointed to hostile takeover bids aimed at PolaroidCorp. and Prime Computer Inc. in Massachusetts, offered norecommendations, but said a state commission studying takeovers isexpected to deliver its final report soon.   Dukakis also met with Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., to discussfederal housing programs. The governor said he was encouraged bysignals from the Bush administration and Jack Kemp, secretary ofhousing and urban development. Housing was a cornerstone of theDemocrat's presidential campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
