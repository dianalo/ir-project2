The U.N. Population Fund, sponsoring the conference that beginsMonday, will seek agreement on eradicating illiteracy among womenby the year 2000 and improving the availability of contraceptives,conference sources said.   The gathering opens the same day the U.S. House ofRepresentatives debates a $15 million proposal to resume funding tothe U.N. agency. The money was cut off in 1985 over anagency-supported Chinese birth control policy.   Nafis Sadik, the U.N. agency's Pakistani executive director,told reporters the aim of the four-day forum is to thrash out alist of ``recommendations'' that governments can use as targets intheir own population control programs.   Those would include figures on bringing down infant and maternalmortality rates and improving women's education, seen as a keyfactor in determining their willingness to accept family planning.   ``Attitude changes seem to take place ... where education levelsare higher, particularly (among) women and girls,'' she said.``Women don't want to have so many children (but) they do becausethat's what's expected of them.'' Demographers say the world'spopulation is 5.2 billion and increases by 90 million a year. Ifnothing is done to slow the rate, the globe could contain 14billion people by the year 2090.   Under the U.N. agency's goals, all school-age girls should beenrolled in some form of education by the year 2000, said aconference source speaking on condition of anonymity.   The source added that the U.N. agency was pressing for agreementon making contraceptives available to at least 56 percent of theworld's women by the year 2000. The figure today is 45 percent.   On the U.S. funding issue, Ms. Sadik said ``the first priorityto us is to get the U.S. back in the consensus'' on familyplanning, rather than arguing for a bigger sum.   Washington withdrew its $36 million funding of the agency in1985 because of allegtions that an agency program in China includedforced sterilizations and abortions.   The Senate has already earmarked $15 million for the resumptionof the U.S. contribution, but President Bush has said he would usehis veto if the measure is approved by the House.   ``They (the U.S. government) don't really have any viewpoint onthe Chinese population program,'' Ms. Sadik said. ``The U.S.decision has somehow got linked to the abortion issue in the UnitedStates.''</TEXT></DOC>
