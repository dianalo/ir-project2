However, no candidate appeared likely to obtain a majority, andCollor de Mello is probably headed for a runoff Dec. 17 againstpopulist Leonel Brizola or Rep. Inacio Lula da Silva.   With 34 percent of Wednesday's vote counted, Collor de Mello, a40-year-old former state governor, had 25 percent, or 6.9 millionvotes, according to Globo TV, the country's largest commercialnetwork.   Brizola, of the Democratic Labor Party, was second with 16percent, tallying 4.5 million votes. Da Silva, of theMarxist-oriented Workers' Party, trailed Brizola by less thanone-half percent, Globo said.   In a suprisingly strong showing, Sen. Mario Covas of theleft-of-center Brazilian Social Democracy Party was fourth with 3.8million votes, or about 14.2 percent of the total, Globo said.   Computer problems reportedly slowed official results.   At noon, 19 hours after the polls closed, the country's SuperiorElectoral Court had tallied just 5.8 percent of the votes. Itshowed Collor leading with 26.6 percent, followed by Brizola with16.5 percent, Lula with 16.3 percent, and Covas with 8.9 percent.   Final results are not expected until Saturday.   More than 82 million voters cast ballots to choose a successorto President Jose Sarney, who by law could not run for re-election.The vote marked the return of full democratic rights after 21 yearsof military rule.   Sarney is a civilian, but he gained office in 1985 through anelectoral college vote coordinated by the military.   Collor de Mello, 40, has been a harsh critic of Sarney. Leadingin the polls since April, his dapper good looks and anti-corruptionplatform made Collor de Mello popular with the poor, a majority inthe Brazilian electorate.   Sarney is widely blamed for official corruption and an annualinflation rate of at least 1,300 percent.   Brazilians ages 18 to 69 were required by law to vote.   Federal police chief Romeu Tuma said in a television interviewthat a small amount of illegal campaigning had been noted butreported no other troubles in balloting across the nation of 150million.   The Superior Electoral Court originally said it would beginreleasing the first official results Wednesday night, then saidthey would not be available until tonight.   The Vote Announcement Center, packed with more than 5,000journalists, workers, foreign dignitaries, government officials andparty heads, turned raucous when the electoral court announced thedelay. Several journalists and foreign ambassadors shouted at courtofficials when no explanation was given.   An electoral court official, who would not give his name, told areporter there was a problem with computer links between Brasilia,the capital, and distant voting precincts.   Promotional TV spots had said Brazil's computerized tallyingsystem would speed vote counting. The results in the 1960 electionwere not announced for three months. Federal police guarded thecenter during the night.   Globo TV kept a parallel computer count and its partial resultsshowed the candidates leading in their regional strongholds.   Collor de Mello, a former governor of the poor northeasternstate of Alagoas, received strong support in the northern andnorthwestern regions. He also led in the southeastern city ofCuritiba and his home city of Maceio on the northeastern Atlanticcoast.   Da Silva, a former labor leader, had support nationwide, and ledin the southeastern industrial city of Belo Horizonte and the poornortheastern cities of Brasilia, Recife and Salvador.   Brizola, a former governor of the states of Rio de Janeiro andRio Grande do Sul, appeared to have his strongest support in theheavily populated southern part of the country. He led in thesouthern capital cities of Porto Alegre, Florianoplis and Rio deJaneiro, and the northern city of Fortaleza, according to GloboTV's returns.   Covas, a dark-horse candidate, held a strong lead in Sao Paulo,the nation's biggest city, and was a solid second in BeloHorizonte, the network reported. It also reported that about130,000 people voted for popular TV game-show host Silvio Santos,who tried to enter the race two weeks before the election but wasdisqualified by the Electoral Court.   Brazil's last free presidential election was in 1960, when JanioQuadros won. Quadros quit after seven months in office, and theensuing confusion led to a 1964 ``anti-communist'' military coup.   The generals banned popular elections for president, althoughrestricted regional voting was allowed.</TEXT></DOC>
