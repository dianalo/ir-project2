U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland also barred strikingMachinists from picketing on Eastern property at LoganInternational Airport in Boston.   Separately, a federal appeals court in Miami told a lower courtto reconsider the airline's request that it force Eastern pilotsback to work.   Earlier, Continental Airlines' flight attendants terminated afour-day strike that had little apparent effect on Eastern's sistercarrier.   The developments came on the 21st day of a walkout by the8,500-member Machinists union being honored by pilots and flightattendants. Eastern is operating a limited schedule on itsNortheast shuttle and on Latin and South American routes.   In New York, Eastern attorneys said in bankruptcy court that theairline was negotiating with rivals to maintain interlineagreements that allow passengers and bags to make connectingflights on different carriers.   Eastern said that without cooperation among carriers, its fewservices would be crippled. The pacts do not govern agreements withother airlines honoring Eastern tickets purchased before the strike.   Lifland granted a two-week extension to an order thatcompetitors honor the agreements.   ``We've had very substantial discussions and negotiations withthe major carriers,'' said Eastern's vice president for marketing,George J. Brennan. ``They're all willing to resolve this.''   Lifland also barred picketing on a 150-yard-long sidewalk infront of Eastern's terminal at Logan International Airport afterthe airline complained Machinists were trespassing on privateproperty.   In Houston, Union of Flight Attendants spokeswoman Myra Claytonsaid the union was notifying flight attendants at Eastern's sisterairline, Continental, to return to work.   Continental said no flights were disrupted or canceled becauseof the walkout. It said 200 flight attendants took part; the unionreported more than 1,200 strikers.   The union, which represents more than 6,000 flight attendants,called the walkout Monday to protest what it said were substandardwages and working conditions at the carrier.   In Miami, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told a lowercourt judge that he had the authority to rule whether the walkoutby Eastern's 3,600 pilots constitutes a primary or secondary strike.   Eastern earlier this month asked the judges to overturn a lowercourt ruling permitting the Air Line Pilots Association to honorstriking Machinists' picket lines under the Railway Labor Act of1926.   ``A claim of a sympathy strike cannot be used as a pretext toshield conduct that otherwise would be a clear violation of theRailway Labor Act,'' the appeals court said.   It said U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis has the authority torule on what kind of strike the pilots are engaged in.   The ALPA said it is buying advertising this weekend in majornewspapers in Miami, Atlanta, Washington, Boston and New York topublicize its position and deter other pilots from going to workfor Eastern.   The advertisement describes the alleged pitfalls of working forFrank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air. Corp.,including limited career opportunities and low pay scales, andsays: ``Pilots choose your career opportunities wisely.''</TEXT></DOC>
