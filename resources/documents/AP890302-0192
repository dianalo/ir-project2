She said annualreports and letters to consumers say Avon puts out 90 percent of itsformulas without testing on animals. ``But, in 1989, no animalsshould suffer to test yet another shampoo, perfume or mascara,'' shesaid.   Jim Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer, saidthat ``no company in the beauty industry has done more to reduceanimal testing than Avon.'' He added that Avon hopes to eliminateall animal testing within three months.   A company statement said Ms. Rich was told by Preston last weekof the progress the company has made. ``The company can only assumethat PETA called this boycott in a self-serving attempt to takecredit for Avon's plans to eliminate testing,'' the statement said.   Preston said the safety of the company's consumers is itsparamount responsibility. ``PETA values human lives on a par withthe lives of rats, mice, guinea pigs and rabbits,'' Preston said.``We do not.''</TEXT></DOC>
