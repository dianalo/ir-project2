The fast-growing computer company said it is recruiting so-called value added resellers with established experience selling computer equipment to customers engaged in computer-aided design, manufacturing, software engineering and publishing fields. Sun, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., will require the resellers to package Sun systems with third-party software or other enhancements before selling them to customers. The resellers also will be restricted to prescribed geographical areas.    Sun said it hopes the broader distribution will help the company sell its machines to commercial customers not currently served, such as more conventional businesses. Since being founded in 1982, Sun has sold nearly 50,000 technical workstations. </TEXT></DOC>
