Con Edison also participatedwith eleven other utilities to develop the Safety Assessment System (SAS)which featured diagnostic probability of major PWR accidents as wellas Critical Safety Functions Monitor. Con Edison selected its initialSPDS contractor in May 1983. When that contractor decided to drop theutility business, the contract was terminated. A second contractor wasselected in March, 1985. Con Edison's ultimate SPDS is a CPI-VAX-CHROMATICSsystem and will be installed in 1987, fully operational and operatorstrained by May 1988. Primary Displays include Critical Safety FunctionsMonitor, Mode Displays, Trends and an Emergency Operating Procedure parameterdisplay. Secondary Displays consist of Safety System Readiness Monitor,Safety System Performance Monitor, Piping and Instrumentation Diagramand Accident Identification Display System. The SPDS/SAS implementationis a complex project because of many reasons. It is essential that SPDSbe accepted by the reactor operators. To do so, not only is operatorinvolvement from the start important, but also the system must be ingood working order when first shown to the operators to gain their confidence.When the SPDS is successfully implemented, it could open up a whole newera of computer-aided nuclear plant operations and control.</TEXT></DOC>
