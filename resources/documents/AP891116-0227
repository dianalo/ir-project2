Heileman Brewing Co. has reachedagreements with creditors that will give it until next June torebound from a declining market share and sales, the company said.   Heileman was given a waiver on its loans from U.S. and Canadianbanks, company President Murray Cutbush said Wednesday. Theagreements will allow the brewer to realize benefits from spendingon capital improvements and marketing in 1989, he said.   In an interview published Wednesday in The Milwaukee Journal,Cutbush responded to a report in Australia that Heileman may not beable to continue as a going concern.   An auditor for Heileman's owner, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. ofAustralia, said in Bond's annual report that cash flow fromHeileman's operations was not projected to be enough to makeprincipal payments on Heileman's long-term debt in fiscal 1990.   ``These factors raise substantial doubt about (Heileman's)ability to continue as a going concern,'' the report said.   Cutbush said that while the company's 1989 performance was lessthan satisfactory, price increases and marketing and capitalexpenditures during the year were made for the long term, not justfor one year.   Heileman could have spent nothing during 1989 and ended the yearwith a better record, he said, ``but that was not the view wetook.''   Heileman spent money on capital improvements and new advertisingand marketing efforts, including the development of newcommercials, all of which ultimately will benefit the brewingoperation, said Cutbush.   The expenditures were painful, he said, but ``done with thelong-term future of Heileman in mind.''   In addition, Heileman closed three breweries, including a largeone in Perry, Ga., and those moves will reduce significantly thebrewery's overhead, Cutbush said. The other two breweries closedare in Evansville, Ind., and Belleville, Ill.   ``We will realize those benefits in the following years,'' hesaid.   Since May, Heileman has been trading profitably, in part becauseof price increases for its premium beers for the first time inyears, Cutbush said.   ``We have seen a significant benefit from the large expenditurefor marketing,'' he said.   Bond bought Heileman in 1987, just weeks before the stock marketcrashed, for about $1.3 billion, and reportedly still owes about$850 million after selling the profitable Heileman Baking Co. andother Heileman subsidiaries.   Analysts have said Bond paid too much for Heileman and cannotservice the debt with Heileman earnings.   The audit of Bond Corp., which is controlled by Australianfinancier Alan Bond, was done in Perth, Australia, by TerryUnderwood, a partner in investment firm Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.   The audit also cast doubt on the value of some of the Australianconcerns assets, including real estate and media properties aroundthe world.   Last month, Bond reported losses of $773.9 million in the fiscalyear ending in June, and the auditors report said those losses arecontinuing.   Underwood said the Bond groups liabilities exceeded assets by$1.36 billion in Australian dollars.</TEXT></DOC>
