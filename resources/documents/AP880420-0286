Allan Wendt, senior representative for strategic technologypolicy, spent two days discussing issues related to theCoordinating Committee for Export to Communist Nations, whichgoverns the sales of restricted items by Western countries.   The talks included Japanese concerns that the U.S. Congress willretaliate against Toshiba Machine Co. for selling banned equipmentto the Soviet Union that enabled the Soviets to build quietersubmarines, Wendt said.   The two sides also discussed improvements in the Japanese exportsystem, cooperation in implementing export controls and cooperativeareas of enforcement, plus streamlining control lists, cooperationfrom third countries and the liberalization of export controls forChina.   Wendt said Japan has enacted a new law that toughens thepenalties against violators, and said 2,200 Japanese companies haveestablished internal controls to prevent further violations.   ``I certainly hope there will never be another ToshibaMachine-type case, which everyone knows was an egregiousviolation,'' he said. ``I think there will continue to beviolations of the COCOM rules. I think it would be unrealistic notto expect violations ... Human greed has been with us for a longtime and is unlikely to disappear,'' he said.   Wendt said Japan ``has come a long way in a short period oftime,'' but that work is still needed to make sure progresscontinues.   Wendt acknowledged there were problems with systems like Japan'swhere the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is in chargeof promoting trade and handling inspections at the same time. Hesaid it was better to have different agencies within governmentresponsible for different areas.   But Wendt added that it would take time for Japan to make thenecessary changes, much as it took the United States several yearsto make corrections following similar violations in the 1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
