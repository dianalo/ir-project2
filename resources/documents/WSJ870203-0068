The department concluded that U.S. corn growers are receiving subsidies totaling 85 cents (U.S.) a bushel. In a preliminary finding in November, the department estimated the subsidies at $1.05 a bushel. On the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, corn for March delivery was quoted at about $1.59 a bushel.    A spokesman for the U.S. National Corn Growers Association said in Washington that the Canadian case has potentially far-reaching implications for U.S. corn growers because it could be cited by groups in other countries seeking protection from U.S. corn imports.    The spokesman said French corn growers cited the Canadian case when they petitioned the European Common Market Commission last month for a countervailing duty on imports of U.S. corn gluten feed, an animal feed.    The Canadian case now goes to the nation's Import Tribunal, which will determine whether imports of subsidized U.S. corn are injuring Canadian farmers. If it says they are, an import levy equal to 85 cents a bushel will be applied to U.S. corn.    The U.S. corn growers spokesman said he was &quot;fairly confident&quot; that the tribunal wouldn't find that Canadian farmers have been injured, because he said U.S. corn exports to Canada have dwindled from three million metric tons five years ago to almost zero at present. The tribunal's ruling is expected by March 7.    The case was initiated by the Ontario Corn Producers Association, which alleged that subsidized imports of U.S. corn were injuring corn production in Canada and were causing &quot;suppressed prices, loss of market share and a distortion of the market cycle.&quot; The U.S. corn growers group said the action &quot;reflects a biased and inaccurate view of U.S. farm programs and their impact on international trade.&quot;    The Canadian Revenue Department said it reduced its calculation of the U.S. subsidy after receiving additional information from the U.S. government on farm programs.    Of the total 85-cent-a-bushel subsidy, the department said payments under the U.S. feed grain program accounted for 72 cents. The department investigated 64 programs operated by the U.S. government as well as programs of 14 state governments. It determined that four of them, including the feed grain program, involved subsidies. </TEXT></DOC>
