But, after an initialsell-off in hectic trading, the market staged a stunningrecovery and ended higher.   Bond prices, which react negatively to upbeat economicnews, tumbled soon after the government reported thatconsumer spending rose in May and that claims forunemployment benefits declined in recent weeks. Even moredistressing to bond investors, the government reported thatproducer prices jumped sharply last month.</LP><TEXT>   In reaction, the bond market's bellwether security, the30-year Treasury bond, fell 1/2 point, a loss of $5 for abond with a $1,000 face amount.   But as the yield on the long-term bond approached 8.6%,the selling spree ended and buyers materialized. When NewYork trading ended yesterday, the benchmark 30-year bond wasquoted nearly 3/8 point higher to yield 8.51%.   &quot;The initial down draft was a knee-jerk reaction to theeconomic numbers,&quot; said F. Ward McCarthy, a managing directorat Stone andamp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc. He said thatbonds were able to bounce back from the lows of the day dueto perceptions that prices had become &quot;cheap,&quot; orundervalued. Also, a closer look at the inflation reportindicated that the big rise was due to several unusualfactors.   Although many of the buyers who rescued the marketpurchased intermediate-term and short-term notes, and notlong-term bonds, traders said the brisk buying activitylifted the entire market.   Despite yesterday's upturn, most Treasurys remaindepressed. Prices have been falling -- and yields have soared-- due to mounting evidence that the economy is recoveringfar more rapidly than many economists had predicted. Whilethat is certainly good for the business sector, such news isviewed bearish by the bond market because investors worrythat a pickup in business activity will stimulate inflation.Bond investors fear inflation because it reduces the value oftheir fixed-income securities.   Yesterday's report on producer prices fanned the flames ofthose fears. The Labor Department said its producer priceindex, a measure of inflation on the wholesale and productionlevel, jumped 0.6% last month, the biggest rise sinceOctober's 1.2% increase in the wake of Iraq's invasion ofKuwait.   Although economists note that unusual factors caused thebig gain in the PPI -- such as a 5.2% jump in gasoline pricesand a 4% jump in tobacco prices -- investors werenevertheless disappointed.   Based on the inflation numbers released so far this year,&quot;it looks like inflation will be more than 4%, and not the 3%to 3.5% level that some people had expected,&quot; said PeterHagel, investment strategist at Van Kampen Merritt.   &quot;Many people who were betting on a weak economy and lowerinflation are very disappointed,&quot; he said. &quot;They're lookingat the economic reports and scratching their heads.&quot;   Mr. Hagel expects bond prices to rally for several days,possibly even a week. But then he believes that yields willstart to rise again and perhaps reach 8.75% sometime thissummer.   The reason: Many big investors who had bet that therecession would continue still own large holding of long-termbonds. Soon, they will be under pressure to liquidate aportion of their long-term bonds, which will cause prices tofall.   Today, the Labor Department will release the consumerprice index for May and the Federal Reserve will release theindustrial production for May.   William Brachfeld, head of government trading at DaiwaSecurities America Inc., doubts that those reports will causemuch excitement. &quot;People are assuming that we're going to getnumbers that are positive for the economy,&quot; he says. &quot;If weget negative numbers -- that will be the surprise.&quot;   Municipal Securities                                                                                                          Municipalities issued a deluge of short-term debtyesterday, much of which was fairly well received due toattractive yields.   Three issuers, Los Angeles County, the state of Wisconsin,and the San Diego Area Local Government, sold more than $1.8billion of short-term debt. Yields on the notes ranged from4.55% to 4.65%.   The largest issue of the day, from Los Angeles County,consisted of $1.3 billion of one-year notes that were pricedto yield 4.55%.   So far this week, more than $2.2 billion of short-termdebt has been priced. The week's note volume is just aprelude to New York state's $3.9 billion spring borrowing,which is slated for Tuesday.   As a result of the heavy issuance, yields on many muninotes have climbed about 0.45 percentage point since the endof May, said David Madigan, vice president of municipalstrategies at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.   &quot;This has always been a seasonal high point,&quot; forshort-term municipal issuance, Mr. Madigan said.   Because many municipalities have fiscal years that end onJune 30, they tend to sell a large amount of short-term debtin June to finance operations in the following fiscal year.The notes are paid off with taxes and other revenues thatarrive in the new fiscal year.   And investors, who are receiving large amounts of cashfrom maturing notes sold last year, are looking to reinvestin new note issues.   Between now and the beginning of July, more than $7billion of short-term municipal borrowing is expected to cometo market, Mr. Madigan estimates. The borrowing barrage couldboost muni note yields even further by early July.   While short-term municipal bond yields generally begin todecline after the beginning of July as demand begins tooutpace supply, the appearance of the $3.9 billion New Yorkstate notes could keep yields inflated.   New York generally conducts its spring borrowing in lateApril or early May. But due to the record delay in adopting abudget this year, the borrowing has been pushed to mid-June.   In addition, due to the national recession and theworsening fiscal problems of states and local governmentsthroughout the country, some new issuers will be tapping theshort-term market.   For example, prior to its sizable revenue anticipationnote offering, which usually comes in late July or earlyAugust, California may sell about $1 billion of debt. NewJersey, whose Triple-A general obligation bond rating faces adowngrade threat from Standard andamp;Poor's Corp., also may tapthe short-term market with a sizable offering, said Mr.Madigan.   In trading, municipals finished the session mixed. Whilemunis moved off earlier session lows, prices of some issuesended the session only 1/8 point higher, unable to match therebound of U.S. Treasurys.   Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys ended higher after a day of hectic tradingactivity. The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 9522/32 to yield 8.51% compared with 95 11/32 to yield 8.55%Wednesday.   Among shorter-term securities, the Treasury's latesttwo-year notes ended at 99 15/32 to yield 7.025% comparedwith 99 13/32 to yield 7.06% Wednesday.   But Treasury bill rates were higher. The discount rate onthree-month bills ended at 5.59% for a bond-equivalent yieldof 5.74%, up from 5.56% to yield 5.71% Wednesday. Thediscount rate on six-month bills ended at 5.81% to yield6.06%, up slightly from 5.80% to yield 6.05%.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          The junk bond market sagged, and most high-risk,high-yield bonds ended fractionally lower in light trading.   The major exceptions were junk bonds of Kaiser Aluminum andamp;Chemical Corp., a unit of Kaiser Aluminum Corp.   Kaiser Aluminum's 14.25% senior subordinated notes, due in1995, added 1 1/4 points to end at 104 1/4.   The gains came after the company's bonds jumped 1 pointWednesday on news that the concern is returning to the stockmarket with an initial public offering of equity.   The company had planned to sell stock earlier this yearbut that offering was scuttled when it became apparent thatsellers would not receive the targeted price for theirshares.   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, prices ofhigh-grade bonds inched higher, registering gains of about1/8 point.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage-securities prices ended with modest gains.   Among active secondary issues, Government NationalMortgage Association 8.5% securities for July delivery wereup 4/32 at 96, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 8.5%securities were 2/32 firmer at 96 1/32 and Federal NationalMortgage Association 8.5% securities were up 2/32 at 9525/32.   In primary activity, a $1 billion deal backed by Visa andMasterCards and issued by Chase Manhattan Bank (USA), a unitof Chase Manhattan Corp., was eagerly received by investorsdespite tight yield spreads.   Yield spreads on asset-backed and mortgage-backedsecurities have narrowed in recent weeks, because pricedeclines in those markets have been less pronounced than inTreasurys.   For instance, the last deal that Chase sold, a $750million offering during the first quarter, was priced toyield 1.14 percentage points over the blend of yields onthree-year and four-year Treasurys. The yield spread on thosesecurities is now 0.80 to 0.85 percentage point.   The Chase deal was priced by underwriters led by ChaseSecurities Inc. to yield 8.846%, which is 0.85 percentagepoint above five-year Treasurys.</TEXT></DOC>
