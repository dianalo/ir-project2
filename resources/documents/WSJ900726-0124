Carter, a once-highflying proxy solicitor, wassentenced to 16 months to four years in prison and wasordered to pay $1 million in restitution after his guiltyplea to charges of grand larceny and personal income-taxevasion.   In a New York state court, Justice George Roberts alsofined Mr. Carter $50,000. In an investigation, the stateOrganized Crime Task Force found that Mr. Carter, former headof Carter Organization, had overcharged or falsely billedclients.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The sentence was pursuant to a plea bargain, wherein thiswas the maximum possible sentence,&quot; said John J. Tigue Jr.,Mr. Carter's attorney at Kostelanetz Ritholz Tigue andamp; Fink.&quot;We had earnestly hoped for a lesser sentence and areobviously disappointed.&quot; Mr. Carter will have to serve atleast the minimum of 16 months.   The fine will be appealed, Mr. Tigue said, but the $1million restitution has been remitted to the Task Force fordistribution.   In 1987, Mr. Carter sold his firm for more than $75million to Britain's VPI Group PLC, which in June renamed itQuorum Communications Inc. Proxy-solicitation firms solicitand collect shareholder votes on behalf of corporations.Yesterday, Quorum announced a separate settlement with thetask force.   Under the terms, Quorum will retain an auditing firm thatfor at least six months will review its business practicesand ensure that clients' restitution claims are handledproperly. In turn, the task force agreed not to bring anycivil or criminal charges against Quorum or its parent.   Quorum also agreed to pay the state $1 million -- separatefrom the restitution payment made by Mr. Carter -- from anyfunds it might receive from a civil suit VPI filed againstMr. Carter in May.   The civil action, filed in federal court in Manhattan,accused Mr. Carter, 41 years old, of racketeering, fraud andbreach of contract.   At the Manhattan law firm Gold andamp; Wachtel, which ishandling the civil action for Mr. Carter, attorney RobertGold said Mr. Carter has made a motion to have the suit heardin state court rather than federal court. VPI's attorneys areto answer the motion late in August or early in September.Judge Thomas Griesa is hearing the case.   ---   REVIEW OF JUDGE SOUTER'S record by the ABA will have newtwists.   At the request of the Justice Department, the reviewalready has begun by the 15-member American Bar AssociationStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which will voteto find the Supreme Court nominee either well-qualified,qualified or not qualified.   In the past, the ABA panel has solicited analyses of anominee's published work from two randomly chosen law-schoolfaculties and from the lawyers at the Standing Committeechairman's own law firm.   But the current chairman, Ralph Lancaster of Portland,Maine, has added a new twist. In addition to two law-schoolfaculties -- Stanford and Northwestern are already at work onJudge Souter -- he has formed an 11-person permanent &quot;readingcommittee&quot; of prominent lawyers to digest the nominee's courtopinions and report back.   The committee, which also has begun working on Judge DavidSouter's decisions, is headed by Rex Lee, solicitor-generalin the Reagan administration and now president of BrighamYoung University.   Among other members are University of Texas law professorCharles Alan Wright, former federal appeals court JudgesPhilip Tone of Chicago and Arlin Adams of Philadelphia,Philip Lacovara, a top in-house lawyer of General ElectricCo. who will soon move to Morgan Stanley, and Drew Days, aYale Law School professor who was Justice Departmentcivil-rights chief in the Carter administration.   Mr. Lancaster said the new reading committee was createdto avoid any suggestions of bias on the part of anyindividual law firm. &quot;I thought it best to put an independentgroup&quot; in place, he said.   There is another twist, as well. Among members of the ABAStanding Committee that will vote on Judge Souter'snomination is William J. Brennan III, a Princeton, N.J.,lawyer and son of Justice William J. Brennan Jr. whoseretirement created the Supreme Court vacancy.   ---   FORMER HOUSING OFFICIALS in New Jersey admit to lying toCongress.   Two former officials of a HUD-sponsored housing agency inPassaic, N.J., pleaded guilty to one count each of lying toCongress and conspiracy to conceal a fraud and kickbackscheme and to evade tax payments.   Paul A. Marguglio, executive director of the PassaicHousing Authority for 20 years, and August C. Michaelis,former attorney for the agency, both entered guilty pleasbefore federal Judge Maryanne Trump Barry in Newark.   Each former official faces a maximum of 10 years in prisonand a fine of as much as $50,000.   As part of the plea-bargain agreement, Messrs. Marguglioand Michaelis will cooperate with the House GovernmentalOperations Subcommittee on Employment and Housing inWashington that is investigating allegations of widespreadcorruption within the U.S. Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment. The Passaic agency was under contract with HUDto provide low-income housing.   A HUD audit report released early this year outlinedevidence showing that almost $1 million in impermissibleexpenses were pocketed by Passaic agency officials. Mr.Marguglio admitted that he conspired with others at theagency to prevent HUD from uncovering a scheme that allowedhim to earn $125,000 more than his annual salary of $84,000in 1989 by illegally holding three other agency jobs.   Mr. Marguglio also pocketed $150,000 in kickbacks paid tohim by Mr. Michaelis so that he could keep his job as agencycounsel. Later, Messrs. Marguglio and Michaelis conspired tohide the scheme and lied to the House subcommittee about itin March.   Messrs. Marguglio and Michaelis are scheduled forsentencing Oct. 4. Three other Passaic housing officialspreviously pleaded guilty to their roles in the kickbackscheme.   &quot;Today's pleas and the earlier convictions underscore thefact that corruption and fraud in HUD housing authoritieshave been both extensive and pervasive,&quot; said MichaelChertoff, U.S. attorney in Newark.   ---   JOHNSON andamp; GIBBS, 300-lawyer Dallas law firm, has broughtin six lawyers from the Houston law firm of Shannon andamp; Beller.The new lawyers, who specialize in financial services,bankruptcy and real estate, will work out of the firm's26-lawyer Houston branch.   ---   Arthur S.
