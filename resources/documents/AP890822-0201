The district's6-year-old high school is flush with computers, up-to-date labs,even a greenhouse and indoor pool.   This eastern Montana district, with a tax base enriched by thepresence of four power plants, offers high school pupils severalforeign languages and such electives as zoology, microbiology andgeology.   Superior, in the western end of the state, spends about $3,000per pupil. The newest school building is 28 years old. There are noscience electives beyond basic biology, chemistry and physics, inlabs described as ``woefully inadequate'' by former superintendentWilliam Donahue.   Indoor swimming pools or greenhouses like in Colstrip?   ``Those would be dreams,'' said Donahue.   Such contrasts between rich and poor districts, endemic tovirtually every state, put school finance at the top of theeducation reform agenda this past year.   As 43 million children prepare for a new school year, anAssociated Press survey found 11 states defending against lawsuitsbrought by parents or school districts challenging theconstitutionality of school funding systems _ systems that criticshave long held discriminate against those living in communities withlower property tax revenues.   ``While many people talk about the importance of educationalreform, children in low-wealth districts would be helped a lot justto be brought to where high-spending districts now are,'' saidArthur Wise, a school finance expert at The RAND Corporation, aWashington think-tank.   States with active lawsuits or court orders concerning schoolfinance are Alaska, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota,Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee and Texas.   A coalition of poor Alabama districts says it will probably suethat state this fall.   In Florida, 22 districts sued the state in 1986. The state won asummary judgment in 1987.   Montana, under court order since February to reform its fundingsystem, held a special legislative session this summer, whichboosted state education spending by $61 million but which criticssay failed to solve the equity problems.   Oklahoma legislators likewise have been meeting in specialsession this summer to consider sweeping proposals by Gov. HenryBellmon that would substitute income and other taxes for much of theschool property tax. So far, nothing has been decided.   The equity issue has reasserted itself in the school reformagenda this year for several reasons. Chiefly, many state fundingsystems are simply out-of-date, formulated in the early 1970s duringthe last great wave of school finance reform.   ``In many states, you have a finance system dating from the early1970s. You still have that system in 1989 when the schoolexpectations, the demographics and the economics are all different.You can take me to any state from Michigan to Iowa to Montana, and Icould tell you that same story,'' said Kent McGuire who follows suchmoney matters for the Education Commission of the States in Denver.   And school reform, with its mandates requiring rich and poordistricts alike to fund smaller classes, higher teacher pay andother costly measures, has pushed many small, tax-poor districts totheir financial limits.   ``It's clear that as the reform agenda moves on, that's anted upthe cost,'' McGuire said.   In many states, the school finance issue is pitting ruraldistricts with poor tax bases against bigger, wealthier ones. Withfarm values declining and fewer children interested in pursuingagricultural careers, the quality of schools in rural districts hasbecome a more urgent concern.   In North Dakota, nine school districts and 48 parents filed suitin June, claiming the state's system of providing aid to schools isunconstitutional.   A school district's ability to finance eduction is ``unfairly andinequitably linked'' to its property wealth, said Calvin Rolfson, aBismarck attorney representing the plaintiffs.   In Texas, where a lawsuit brought by a group of smaller districtsis pending before the state Supreme Court, lead attorney Al Kauffmansaid, ``They have no chemistry, no physics, no calculus, foreignlanguage, pre-kindergarten, or college prep, no extra-curricular, noband, choir, football, no debate. They have 96 percent low-incomestudents. Those students are not being given a chance in thissociety.''   ``We've managed to just squeak by year after year,'' said AntonioParra, a spokesman for the San Elizario school district. ``Buttaxpayers in our school district will probably face another taxincrease. How long can you stretch a rubber band?''   In Connecticut, Oregon and New Jersey, by contrast, the poorchildren suing the state live in metro areas.   The non-profit Education Law Center, in a suit on behalf of 20school-aged children in Camden, Irvington, East Orange and JerseyCity, N.J., won its first victory last summer when AdministrativeLaw Judge Steven Lefelt ruled that the 1975 state formula forfunding public education has failed and is unconstitutional.   In a scathing ruling, Lefelt found that poorer, urban districtsare overcrowded, have fewer teachers, poor equipment, decayingbuildings, and more limited course offerings than wealthy suburbandistricts.   State education commissioner Saul Cooperman has rejected thosefindings, as has Gov. Thomas H. Kean who dismissed Lefelt's rulingas ``an interesting liberal treatise.'' The state Supreme Court isscheduled to hear arguments Sept. 25.   In Connecticut, where the state is being sued by a group of urbanschoolchildren and parents, assistant superintendent Daniel Shamasin Bridgeport said his district fights a constant budget battle.   Bridgeport spends $5,431 per year on each of its 19,270 students.Affluent Westport, just 10 miles away, spends $8,299 per pupil.   ``If you look at the state as a whole, you see twoConnecticuts,'' one rich and one poor, Shamas said. ``If you look atwhat we're spending per pupil and what other (more wealthy) townsare spending, that tells the whole story.''   Westport Schools Comptroller Frederick J. Nigri rejects theargument that rich and poor towns offer substantially differenteducational opportunities.   ``For the basic educational program, a child can get a great dealout of a big-city system if they're motivated,'' Nigri said. ``Wemay have some better enrichment programs, perhaps a little betterdrama program, but I like to think there's some education equality.''   While not yet the subject of a lawsuit in Michigan, schoolfinance has become one of that state's thorniest issues. Afterfailing to solve the problem, the legislature has placed twocompeting referendums for voters to decide in November. One wouldraise some $400 million in school funds with a sales tax hike; theother would hike sales taxes by $468 million but offer $1.3 billionin property-tax relief.   ``There has never been a time that I've been told by thedistricts and educators that we've provided enough money,'' said KenNelson, a legislator in Minnesota where 48 school districts havefiled suit claiming that state's funding formula is unfair. ``Nobodyknows what really is enough money. That's a judgment call.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 27</NOTE></DOC>
