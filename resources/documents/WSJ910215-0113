The No. 3 U.S. auto maker is seeking to eliminate about3,000 nonunion jobs, primarily through special earlyretirement offers. But persons inside the company, who askednot to be named, said Chrysler may need to resort to layoffsif the retirement packages don't attract enough takers or ifconditions in the U.S. auto market continue to deteriorate.</LP><TEXT>   Chrysler officials said the auto maker is still working onspecific details of the plan, which Chrysler is expected topublicly outline by the end of this month.   Chrysler is also expected to offer its United Auto Workersemployees special early buy-outs permitted under the union'scontract, these people said. About 1,400 union workersaccepted a similar offer last summer.   The expected cutbacks would leave Chrysler with about24,000 salaried workers, down from a current level of about27,000. That would put its white-collar payroll just abovethe 22,000 employees left on its staff in 1983 after the automaker laid off thousands of people to stave offbankruptcy-law proceedings.   But during the mid- and late-1980s, Chrysler'swhite-collar ranks grew steadily. Chrysler employed about35,000 whitecollar workers just after it purchased AmericanMotors Corp. in 1987.   Chrysler spokesman Steven J. Harris declined to comment onthe job cutbacks, other than to say that staff reductions arean expected part of Chrysler's 18-month-long cost-cuttingefforts. Chrysler recently raised the target for thatcampaign to $3 billion in savings.   Chrysler is not alone among the Big Three in itspayroll-slashing efforts. Ford Motor Co., which had afourth-quarter loss of $519 million, also is moving to reduceits salaried ranks. The company will try to use attrition,but David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president of finance andtreasurer, said yesterday that white-collar layoffs are &quot;verylikely.&quot;   General Motors Corp., which yesterday reported a record$1.6 billion quarterly loss from operations in the fourthperiod, had previously announced a sweeping cost-reductionplan that included the elimination of 15,000 white-collarjobs in North America by 1993. About 6,000 of those jobs arescheduled to disappear this year.   Chrysler executives have been signaling for months thatstaff reductions would come. &quot;The choice for the Americanautomobile industry is not between less employment or moreemployment,&quot; Chrysler President Robert A. Lutz said lastmonth. &quot;It's between less employment or no employment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
