Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith said such a clearance bythe Interstate Commerce Commission is required when the holder of arailroad seeks to acquire another.   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific now controls four ``short line''railroads, used primarily to transport products and raw materialsto and from company facilities. She said Great Northern, based inNorwalk, Conn., also controls four rail lines.   ``This is part of the process,'' Ms. Smith said. ``BothGeorgia-Pacific and Great Northern control railroads, and this is aclearance necessary for approval to acquire Great Northern'srailroads.''   Georgia-Pacific, one of the largest producers of forestproducts, last month offered to acquire Great Northern in atransaction valued at $3.13 billion, or $58 a share for each ofGreat Northern's approximately 54 million shares of outstandingstock.   Great Northern is expected to respond next week to the tenderoffer, which expires at midnight EST Nov. 29.   Officials at Great Northern declined to comment on the ICCdecision. Stephen Hill, Great Northern's director of investorrelations, also declined to comment on his company's continuedconsideration of the Georgia-Pacific offer.   ``We have to issue a formal response next week, and we will,''Hill said.   Ms. Smith said Georgia-Pacific operates a railroad inCalifornia, two in Arkansas and one between Louisiana andMississippi.   Great Northern has two railroads in Georgia, one in Mississippiand one in Wisconsin.</TEXT></DOC>
