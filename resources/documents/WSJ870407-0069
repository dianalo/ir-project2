He fondly recalls following his stock's performance with his grandfather, who died three years ago. &quot;When I get statements from ATandamp;T,&quot; Mr. Groffman says, &quot;I think of him.&quot;    At a time when stock prices are driven largely by the cold calculations of profit-hungry money managers, some people still base their investment decisions on emotions that have little to do with greed. Tax considerations certainly motivate many long-term holders of securities, but market specialists say others seem to be seeking psychic as well as financial rewards.    A 1985 survey by the New York Stock Exchange indicates that almost half the 47 million Americans who own stock in publicly traded companies or mutual funds hold shares in only one issue or one mutual fund. And it's likely, says Richard Ross, executive director of the Center for the Study of Investor Behavior in Chicago, &quot;that people own shares in that company because they work for it, or used to work for it, or they inherited it or they have some other emotional attachment to it.&quot;    Sentimental stockholders like these &quot;are saying, 'I'm a loyal person,'&quot; explains Maurice Elvekrog, a Birmingham, Mich.-based investment counselor who holds a doctorate in psychology.    And loyalty sometimes pays off. An investment adviser in the Detroit area tells of a woman whose father left her some stock in a small company in New York. Before he died in the 1920s, the man made his daughter promise always to invest her spare cash in the company's shares -- a promise she kept for many years. The company turned out to be a predecessor of International Business Machines Corp. And the woman, who died a few years ago, became very wealthy.    Similarly, Wayne Janus, a financial planner in Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., says one of his clients has seen the value of her stock in a Midwestern distributor of consumer products rise 6,200% to more than $9 million, not counting dividends, in the 20 years since her husband's death.    The husband, who had been chairman of the company, had told his wife never to sell, no matter what advice she received from her bankers, accountants or lawyers. &quot;She felt he knew what he was talking about,&quot; Mr. Janus says. &quot;There's probably no investment she could have made that would have done as well.&quot;    Of course, emotional investors can also get clobbered. William Thompson, a financial planner with the brokerage firm of Raymond James andamp; Associates in Wilmington, Del., recalls a client a few years back who watched the value of his Sun Co. shares drop dramatically. (Sun shares have since bounced back; they recently rose above $70 a share, compared with a low of $26.75 in 1982.)    Oil stocks were taking a beating at the time, and Mr. Thompson tried to convince his client to diversify. But the second-generation Sun employee, who had retired, refused to sell any of his Sun shares, even though his yield was so low that he had to get a part-time job to supplement his pension income.    &quot;It was emotion that stopped him from making a proper investment decision,&quot; says Mr. Thompson, who estimates that 80% of his clients have some sort of emotional attachment to their securities.    At Mr. Thompson's urging, another client, an ATandamp;T retiree, agreed to sell about $25,000 of ATandamp;T stock and buy tax-free bonds to boost his income. But a few days later, the client ordered Mr. Thompson to cancel the transaction.    &quot;He said his wife was so upset that she had been vomiting in the sink for two days,&quot; Mr. Thompson recalls.    Charles Ricker, an investment adviser in Grosse Point, Mich., had more success with a client who had a big position in General Motors Corp. stock in 1980. At the time, the auto industry was on the skids, and General Motors had cut its dividend almost in half. Mr. Ricker says he didn't have much trouble persuading the client to sell some of his General Motors shares.    &quot;Suddenly, he was faced with the reality of not having an income to match his life style,&quot; Mr. Ricker recalls.    Sentimental shareholders often have especially strong ties to stocks selected by their fathers. &quot;They view (selling) as a repudiation of the father's judgment,&quot; says Mr. Elvekrog, the investment adviser and psychologist.    For James Feeney, a 48-year-old advertising executive in New York, selling the Bank of New York shares his father bought while working in the bank's trust department would be even worse than that. &quot;It would be violating a tradition,&quot; he says.    Mr. Feeney, who expects to inherit some of the shares, already has promised his 77-year-old father that he will never sell. &quot;It means a lot to him,&quot; says the younger Mr. Feeney. &quot;That's the only place he ever worked.&quot;    The shares also mean a lot to the son, who now counts the bank among his clients. &quot;It's a very special feeling,&quot; he says. &quot;It gives me a nice link with the past.&quot;    Still, emotions work both ways, and sometimes they can trigger stock sales. Mr. Feeney, for instance, says he sold some shares of MCI Communications Corp. at a loss last year, after MCI fired his advertising agency. &quot;I just wanted to get rid of it,&quot; he says. &quot;I was teed off.&quot;    And Mr. Elvekrog recently liquidated the stock portfolio of a client in her 40s who had gotten a divorce. &quot;She wanted to sell everything,&quot; he says, &quot;and start over.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
