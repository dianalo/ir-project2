The telecommunications giant wants the Federal Communications Commission to take over the Justice agency's role.    Five of the seven regional companies immediately branded the suggestion as self-serving and an attempt to throw more obstacles in their path. The regional Bell companies argue that ATandamp;T is simply maneuvering to slow their entry into businesses that interest ATandamp;T. The other Bell companies declined to comment.    In a motion filed with federal Judge Harold Greene, ATandamp;T said the FCC rather than the Justice agency should review the regional Bell concerns' new-business requests. Under procedures adopted since the Bell System breakup, the Bell regionals must get permission from Judge Greene to enter new businesses, after the Justice Department reviews their plans and makes recommendations to the judge.    Alfred C. Partoll, an ATandamp;T senior vice president in charge of coordinating with the Bell companies, said the concerns have filed about 140 of these so-called waivers with Judge Greene, and that most of them have been granted.    The ATandamp;T executive said the company believes the FCC is better qualified to review the waivers. He said ATandamp;T was responding to concerns raised during legislative hearings by both the Bell companies and federal officials about the Justice Department's role in the process.    Some of the Bell companies contend that approval of ATandamp;T's request would slow their entry into new businesses because the FCC is bound by certain lengthy procedures in its review process. But Mr. Partoll said those procedures probably could be waived.    &quot;I am amazed they (the Bells) would believe that the FCC isn't fully capable of handling these waiver applications at least as expeditiously, if not more so, than the Justice Department,&quot; said Mr. Partoll.    &quot;That view isn't shared by all the Bell operating companies,&quot; Mr. Partoll added. &quot;That kind of comment indicates they don't have much faith in the FCC's ability to control its own processes, or perhaps it reflects some misgivings about the extent to which the FCC is committed to competition.&quot;    Mr. Partoll said one effect of having the FCC review waivers instead of the Justice Department would be to eliminate confusion over whether ATandamp;T and its former subsidiaries should be allowed to sell so-called information services. The FCC and Judge Greene can make rulings affecting the ability of the companies to sell these services, which have yet to be defined.    By having the FCC involved in the waiver process, ATandamp;T and the Bell companies would be less likely to be faced with having one entity approve their entry into information services while the other disapproved. Conceivably, ATandamp;T could enter those markets sooner than August 1990, as currently provided in the decree that broke up the Bell System.    The ATandamp;T filing &quot;would provide a vehicle for avoiding confrontation between Judge Greene and the FCC,&quot; Mr. Partoll said.    But Southwestern Bell Corp., the St. Louis-based regional concern, said it sees &quot;ATandamp;T's proposal to fragment responsibility . . . as confusing and not in the best interest of anyone, except perhaps ATandamp;T.&quot; The company said the proposal, if adopted, could &quot;cause considerable delays&quot; in getting waivers considered and, thus, hinder competition.    While conceding that the review process needs streamlining, several of the regionals pointed out that ATandamp;T's proposal wouldn't remove Judge Greene from the process. The regionals have supported proposed national legislation that would replace Judge Greene and the Justice Department with the FCC in regulating ATandamp;T and its offspring. &quot;It seems to us that the way to streamline is to put all of the authority in the hands of the FCC,&quot; said a spokesman for Bell Atlantic Corp., Philadelphia.    Englewood, Colo.-based U S West Inc. said the best approach would be to eliminate restrictions on which businesses the regional concerns can enter. Under the accord that broke up the Bell System in 1984, the regional companies are restricted from providing long-distance and information services and from any manufacturing activities.    ---   Bell Atlantic Buys a Firm   PHILADELPHIA -- Bell Atlantic Corp. said it acquired Technology Concept Inc., a closely held software concern based in Sudbury, Mass. Terms weren't disclosed.    The regional Bell concern said in disclosing the acquisition that it had selected networking software as its niche in the information industry.    Technology Concept expects sales to exceed $5 million in 1986, Bell Atlantic said.    Separately, ATandamp;T said it agreed to acquire Ford Aerospace Satellite Services Corp., a unit of Ford Motor Co., for $2.7 million in cash and other considerations.    The companies asked the FCC to transfer to ATandamp;T the Ford unit's authorization to build, launch and operate two new communications satellites. ATandamp;T said it is seeking the transfer in order to assure its satellite customers of service into the next century. </TEXT></DOC>
