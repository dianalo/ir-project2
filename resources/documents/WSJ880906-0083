The company maintains that the sympathy strikes and pickets are illegal under labor contracts at the five Midwest and Southwest locals, and is asking the court to award Fleming $21 million in damages. The suits were filed in federal courts in Oklahoma City; San Antonio, Texas; Houston; Kansas City, Mo., and Joplin, Mo. At those sites, 780 workers have walked out last week in support of 2,100 California Teamsters, who have been on strike since early June.    Fleming also charges that the striking workers have threatened management and replacement workers with violence and have damaged company trucks and the homes of some of its employees.    Teamsters officials in Washington, D.C., didn't return phone calls and officials in Chicago weren't available for comment.    The labor dispute began June 9 after Fleming and its Fremont, Calif., local couldn't agree on a new contract. The union has said the company, which unilaterally cut wages earlier this year, wanted further cuts. Fleming said it sought the lower wages because the Teamsters had granted a competitor in the area a contract with lower salaries than it was paying. About 825 workers in the company's two Philadelphia plants walked out in sympathy in early August.    The company said it has begun replacing many of the striking workers at the five locations and the Philadelphia distribution facility. In Oklahoma City, for instance, where 213 Teamsters are on strike, the company has hired more than 250 replacements after receiving more than 600 applications for the strikers' jobs, Fleming said.    Although the company is quickly returning to normal operations, the strikes have affected 13 of the company's 45 distribution centers and 3,600 of the company's 26,000 workers. Those centers serve nearly 2,000 of Fleming's 5,700 retail food store customers. The company said it has labor contracts with the Teamsters covering another 12 distribution centers.    The widespread nature of the strike and the increased costs of training, hiring, security and advertising have led analysts to lower their estimates of 1988 earnings for Fleming. Even though the replacement workers are helping Fleming quickly regain much of the business it lost because of the strikes, Donald Cassidy, analyst for Boettcher andamp; Co., Denver, has lowered his estimate to $2.60 a share for 1988 from his March estimate of $2.85. &quot;In the short term, there has to be a significant impact from the lack of productivity from untrained people,&quot; said analyst Gary Vineberg of Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., New York.    In July, the company said it expected the California strike to lower its earnings for the second quarter ended July 9 by eight cents a share, or about $2.1 million. As a result, Fleming said, its profit will be less than the $15 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.    But labor lawyers and analysts said the battle may have more long-term impact on the union than the company. Once the strike in California is settled, striking laborers in the other cities will want their jobs back and the company and union will have to fight over who gets them -- the strikers or the replacement workers. Courts have ruled in some earlier cases that striking workers who have no-strike clauses aren't entitled to get their jobs back.    &quot;Now everyone has gone out on a limb and it's going to take a long time to get back off that limb,&quot; said a labor lawyer who has dealt with similar situations in the meatpacking industry. </TEXT></DOC>
