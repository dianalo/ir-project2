Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, saidin a speech to a U.S. League of Savings Institutions conferencethat the ailing savings and loan industry is ``getting better.''   But, he added, ``The healthy are getting healthier, and the sickare getting sicker.''   The caseload of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,which insures savings deposits of up to $100,000, includes 259``grossly insolvent institutions,'' he said.   ``We are clearly on a track that will have us resolving 259institutions as a minimum by the end of next year,'' Wall said.   He said he expected it would cost $17.4 billion to shut down orbail out the sick institutions. About 50 cases have been dealt withthis year, he said.   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, hasestimated that some 500 Sandamp;Ls are insolvent, more than 200 of themhopelessly so.   Last month, the bank board reported that the 3,118 federallyinsured savings institutions suffered losses of $3.8 billion in thefirst three months of this year, more than half of the record $7.6billion loss in 1987.   Because of the Sandamp;L troubles, FSLIC ended 1987 with a negativenet worth of $13.7 billion. Congress approved a measure to raise$10.8 billion for the insurance fund through the sale of bonds.   That, together with insurance premium payments by Sandamp;Ls, isexpected to give the fund $20 million over three years. Wall hassaid it is too soon to tell if more will be needed later.</TEXT></DOC>
