 Thecompany emphasized that the program was intended as much more than an upgradefor the existing ReadySetGo line.andP;  We could see an opportunity for a moresophisticated product than was yet available through retail channels, andthat was what DesignStudio was meant to be.andP;  But how good would the productreally be?andP;  Letraset's plans sounded great, but we wanted to see what theactual package was like before getting our hopes up.andM;Now we have had a chance to work with DesignStudio.andP;  It does provide a lot ofnew functionality, especially in typography.andM;Letraset has made a point of emphasizing the &quot;professional&quot; features ofDesignStudio.andP;  The opening words of the manual are: &quot;Welcome to designStudio,the first page design and production application created for you, thecreative prfessional!&quot;andP;  A few pages later; &quot;The options for controlling wordspacing, rag settings, and hyphenation compare with high-end composntionsystems.&quot;andM;Clearly, Letraset wanted DesignStudio to appeal to a more sophisticated classof users than PageMaker of QuarkXpress (or Letraset's own ReadySetGo).andP;  Andeven a glance at the feature list reveals items that can only be directed atsophisticated users.andM;This high-end emphasis left us in a quandary about how to reviewDesignStudio.andP;  Should we compare it to PageMaker and Xpress?andP;  Surely it isalso a &quot;desktop&quot; package.andP;  It runs on the same platforms and is sold throughthe same channels.andM;But Letraset's claims of &quot;professional&quot; features also need to be addressed.andO;If these claims are to be taken seroiusly, the proper comparison is with thefeatures of dedicated typesetting systems like those from Penta, Quadex,Bestinfo, Magna and Atex.andM;We concluded we needed to make both kinds of comparisons, so we have donethat.andM;Desktop horserace.andP;  Initially, we thought DesignStudio might greatlyoutdistance the desktop competition.andP;  But as we started work on this review,we began to realize that it would be coming out at just about the same timeas two major upgrades of competing packages: PageMaker 4.0 and Xpress 3.0.andO;And as we found out more about these upgrades, we recognized that aneck-and-neck race was shaping up.andP;  A lot of new functionality was beingadded to both packages, and it was impossible to predict which of the three,if any, would end up clearly superior.andM;So we decided we needed to wait before making comparisons with Xpress andPageMaker.andP;  We will focus on describing DesignStudio on its own terms, andmaking some comparisons with dedicated typesetting systems.andM;Undeniably, the comparisons with dedicated systems have lent a more criticaltone to this article than it would have had if the comparison had been onlywith desktop products.andP;  But we urge the reader not to judge DesignStudioharshly because of this.andP;  The package is in many respects an improvement overwhat has been the norm for desktop typography.andM;In addition to its typographical features, DesignStudio offers good graphicssupport.andP;  It also serves as part a family of products from one vendor thatare being intetrated: LetraStudio, FontStudio, LetraFont, ImageStudio,ColorStudio and ReadySetGo.andP;  We will cover the graphics features ofdesignStudio, but our emphasis in this review is on typography, since that iswhere (in our opinion) DesignStudio makes its main contribution to thedesktop field.andM;The major features of PageMaker 4.0 are rpestend elsewhere in this issue.andO;But those who want a detailed comparison with ofther desktop packages mustwait for our next issue.andP;  There, we plan to review Xpress 3.0 and make somedetailed comparisons among DesignStudio, PageMaker, Xpress and VenturaPublisher.andM;Platform and user interfaceandM;DesignStudio is a Macintosh program.andP;  It follows the normal Macintoshconventions, so working with it should present few problems to those who haveused other Macintosh applications.andP;  As a desktop-publishing application, itowes a lot to both PageMaker and ReadySetGo.andP;  Users of those two programswill find many familiar features.andM;A hard disk is required for DesignStudio.andP;  Though very small projects may bedone on a Macintosh with 1 MB of memory, 2 MB is the recommended minimum andmost projects will require it.andP;  A Macintosh with a 68030 processor isimportant if you will be using the compute-intensive features ofDesignStudio, such as graphics handling and text rotation.andM;Installations is easy.andP;  It consists of copying a series of files off floppydisks and into folders created on the hard disk of the Macintosh.andP;  There isno copy protection.andM;Most high-end systems have mechanisms for automating workflow and for keepingtrack of the status of work in progress.andP;  There isn't any facility alongthose lines in DesignStudio.andP;  There is no special file or job managementbeyond the normal Macintosh files and folders.andP;  Publishing operations whichrequire more must look to external packages, such as Odesta's ODMS, to supplyit.andM;Page setup and layoutandM;In DesignStudio, as in other Macintosh desktop packages, everything beginswith the page.andP;  The first step with any new project is to establish the basicformat of the page.andM;Fairly long documents can be handled, but the kinds of tools you need forautomating the pagination of long documents are mostly missing.andP;  (There is,however, a powerful &quot;styles&quot; feature and an optional programming featurecalled DesignScript.andP;  These could be expanded to become the heart of apagination approach if Letraset chose to move in that direction.)andM;The basic setup in DesignStudio will seem familiar to PageMaker users.andP;  Youchoose what size you want your page to be (up to 99&quot; X 99&quot;) and DesignStudiopresents you with a blank page, surrounded by a &quot;pasteboard&quot; work area.andP;  Ifyou like, DesignStudio will provide register marks outside the image area.andO;You can work with single pages or spreads.andP;  Left and right Master Pages areused to establish elements that will repeat on each page.andP;  For a given page,they can be suppressed by turning off the &quot;Use Master&quot; choice in the Pagemenu.andM;The pasteboard area, as in PageMaker, can be used to temporarily lay itemsaside while rearranging things.andP;  It can also be a mechanism for moving itemsfrom one page to anther.andP;  (The pasteboard concept has proved handy.andP;  We notethat Quark is adding it to Xpress in the next release.)andM;Guides and grids.andP;  DesignStudio gives you two types of alignment aids forlaying out pages: guides and grids.andP;  Both are positioning tools that do notthemselves print out.andP;  A grid is a pattern of rectangles dividing up thepage.andP;  ReadySetGo emphasizes grids.andP;  Guides are movable vertical andhorizonal lines that can be placed on the page.andP;  PageMaker pioneered these.andO;You can alternate between grids and guides (but you can't use both at once)in DesignStudio.andM;For magazines and catalogs whose conventional pasteup is based on a grid, theelectronic grid may be a good match.andP;  Only DesignStudio and ReadySetGo havegrids, and they are often valuable in a design-oriented environment.andM;But the grid approach is a bit too rigid for some publications, since it isan array of rectangles all of precisely the same size.andP;  Many publications aremore suited to the guide-based approach.andP;  And guides are wonderful foraligning things in multi-element work such as business forms.andP;  Once youposition a guide, you can lock it in place to guard against inadvertentrepositioning.andM;Items will automatically &quot;snap to&quot; guides or grids unless you turn thisfeature off.andP;  You get to select the distance over which the &quot;attraction&quot; ofthe guides and grids can work.andM;At the left of the page, and across the top, DesignStudio provides rulersthat help you tell where you are on the page.andP;  These can be displayed orsuppressed, and their units can be specified.andP;  Different units are possible:inches vertically, for example, but picas horizontally.andP;  We like the factthat the rulers can be zeroed to any spot on the page, and measurements canthen be made relative to that point.andM;A helpful DesignStudio feature is &quot;stationery&quot; documents.andP;  These are exactlythe same as any other document, except for two things: the icon has a dropshadow (which is not present in normal DesignStudio document icons); and whenyou open the stationery documents, you are given a copy to work with--theoriginal stationery document remains intact.andP;  (To alter it, you must open itvia a special choice in the file-opening dialog box.)andP;  Thus, a stationerydocument acts as a document template, to be used whenever a repeat job isdone.andM;Windows.andP;  DesignStudio lets you have several windows, with several differentdocuments, open at the same time.andP;  These can be stacked on top of oneanother, or they can be &quot;tiled&quot; so that each gets one-fourth of the screenarea.andP;  The number of simultaneously open documents is limited only byavailable memory.andP;  Support for multiple windows is a handy feature we'd liketo see other packages support.andM;Normally you work with a single page, or a two-page spread, in a window.andP;  Butyou can also choose a &quot;thumbnail&quot; view, in which miniature versions of yourdocument's pages are displayed.andM;The thumbnail view is a handy way to check on the status of the wholedocument.andP;  It is more than a passive viewing mode: you can rearrange thepages of your document from the thumbnail view.andP;  You can also duplicate anddelete pages from there.andP;  But most other functions--including chaining textblocks from page to page--cannot be done in thumbnail mode.andP;  Thumbnailversions of pages can be printed as well as viewed.andM;Text basicsandM;Text is entered into &quot;text blocks&quot; that have been created on the page.andP;  Theseblocks can be of various shapes, not just rectangular.andP;  You can create textblocks that are rounded boxes, circles, diamonds, triangles andparallelograms, and any of these can be stretched vertically, horizonally orboth.andP;  Text types or imported into these shapes will conform to the shape ofthe block.andP;  You would't use many of these options every day, but some wouldcome in handy for heavily-designed work such as ads.andM;The position of the text within the block can be specified.andP;  It can rise tothe top, sink to the bottom, float in the enter, or spread itself out to fillthe whole shape.andP;  The spreading (or vertical justification) can occur eitherbetween lines or between paragraphs.andM;A text block is one form of what DesignStudio calls an &quot;object.&quot;andP;  You can doa variety of things with objects, and many of them will be described later inthe article.andP;  But one is important enough to mention now: objects, includingtext blocks, cna be rotated to any angle.andM;DesignStudio does a good job of implementing text rotation.andP;  It can be doneinteractively with the mouse or by keying an exact angle into a dialog box.andO;Once rotated, the text is still editable.andP;  When you place the text editingtool on it, the text box returns to upright orientation, ready for editing.andO;Once you are finished editing, and start working with another text block orwith another tool, the text goes back to its rotated position.andM;Rotation is compute-intensive and that makes it relatively slow, even on a68030-based Mac.andP;  On a 68000 machine, like a Mac Plus or SE, it can bepainfully slow.andP;  When you call up a page with rotated text, you can expect towait a bit while it redisplays.andM;Writing and editing.andP;  DesignStudio is not meant as a writing tool, and wewouldn't suggest using it as one.andP;  Small projects could be created directlyin it, though, and it is fine for correcting the text of long documents, oncewritten.andP;  The usual cut, copy and past functionality is supported.andM;DesignStudio has a spelling checker, with a user dictionary in addition tothe built-in one.andP;  You can get the checker to stop pausing for a particularword by adding it to the user dictionary.andP;  The spelling checker will providea suggested correct spelling if you request it.andM;Other author aids, such as outlining, theaurus and style or grammar checking,are not provided.andP;  There is no facility specifically for comments or queries,but the ability to designate a block of text as &quot;non-printing&quot; could servethis function in some applications.andP;  There is no mechanism for keeping trackof where changes have been made.andM;Working with text blocks.andP;  Small elements of text, such as headlines andindividual paragraphs, can have their own blocks on the page.andP;  You wouldprobably key them directly on the page.andP;  The blocks can be moved aroundfreely with the mouse.andP;  You click the mouse cursor on the block to select it,then move the mouse to reposition the block.andM;If you move the mouse immediately after pressing the mouse button, arectangle (the same size as the text) will move with the mouse.andP;  If you pausebefore moving the mouse, the text characters themselves will move with themouse.andP;  The second method is a bit less interactive, but it permits precisevisual positioning.andP;  These two modes of positioning are implemented in thesame way as they are in PageMaker.andM;Longer pieces of text will be spread over several text blocks.andP;  In manycases, this text would have been prepared beforehand in a word-processingpackage.andP;  The first step in allocating text files to pages is deciding howyou want the text to flow.andP;  You can get text to flow from column to columnand page to page by chaining together blocks you have created.andP;  Insertingadditional pages at this step will cause them to be linked too.andP;  If youinsert pages at the front of the document, you can extend the chain forwardto these also, so that they endup at the front of the chain.andP;  You cannot dothe chaining from the multi-page &quot;thumbnail&quot; view, though it would be nice ifyou could.andM;If, as you work with the text, you wish to stop the rippling of the text backthrough the document, you can insert a strategically-placed page or columnbreak.andP;  This can be removed later if you want to redistribute the text afteryou are done working.andM;You don't have to specify page numbers for the page folios and some pagereferences.andP;  You can insert special symbols which get their numerical valuefrom the relative position of the page.andP;  There is a symbol meaning &quot;thenumber of this page,c and others for the preceding and following pages, thepage numbers containing the preceding and following text blocks (for jumppages), and the total number of pages in the document.andM;If you are working with a long file that must all be fit into a block or achain of blocks, it is important to be able to tell whether you have textleft over and how many extra lines there are.andP;  DesignStudio indicates thepresence of additional unplaced text by a small marker, shaped like abackwards &quot;L,&quot; in the lower right-hand corner of the last block.andP;  It is easyto overlook.andP;  We found it useful to add an extra block to the chain for theoverflow text.andP;  This can be outside the page boundaries on the pasteboardarea.andP;  It provides visual feedback on the amount of excess text.andM;Runarounds.andP;  In addition to block shapes, the shape of text can be modifiedby runarounds, which avoid another object on the page.andP;  The other object canbe a picture block, a created graphic, or a different text block.andP;  (Droppedcapitals are created by having body text run around a text block containing asingle large capital.)andP;  The user selects the objects, chooses &quot;text repel&quot; asone of its specifications, and enters a &quot;repel distance&quot; by which the textmust avoid it.andM;In the case of a graphic, the text can be told to run around either the&quot;shape&quot; (the boundary of the picture block) or the &quot;graphic&quot; (the non-whiteportion of the image).andP;  The facility worked well in the examples we tried.andM;Type specifications.andP;  Basic typographic specifications can be applied viapull-down menus or via a special dialog box.andP;  The former is faster if you arejust changing one thing--font, perhaps, or size.andP;  But if you are applyingseveral specifications at once, the dialog box is more efficient.andM;In addition to font, style, size and leading, you can indicate whetherkerning, tracking and hyphenation should be on or off, and what color or tintvalue you want the text to be.andP;  (PMS colors are supported, as well as RGB,HSV, and CMYK specifications.)andM;You can specify which language you are using, for hyphenation and spellingpurposes.andP;  Currently, only English is available, but Letraset is about tobegin offering 15 others: Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, French, German,Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Greek, Icelandic, Turkish, Russian,Croatian and Finnish.andP;  These will all be offered as &quot;annexes.&quot;andP;  The user willget one keyboad layout (usually the local one for the language in the countrywhere the package is purchased) and up to four language dictionaries.andP;  Youwill be able to indicate, either through menus or through styles, which partof the text is in which language, so the appropriate spell-checkin andhyphenation is done.andM;Customized versions of DesignStudio, with menus and dialog boxes in the locallanuage, will be done through distribution organizations in each country.andM;One of the things you can't do is electronically condense or expand type by aspecified amount.andP;  DesignStudio provides only a single choice, whichincreases or reduces type width by about 20%.andP;  This parameter should reallybe variable and under user control.andM;Buttons on the specifications dialog box lead to further choices for settingup tabs and indents and for establishing the horizontal word andletterspacing and vertical spacing around paragraphs.andP;  We will return tothose functions.andM;Styles.andP;  With a long document, you will often want to have consistentformatting throughout.andP;  That is where &quot;styles&quot; are valuable.andP;  All the typespecifications for a given type of text--a subhead, for example--can becodified as a style.andP;  (Or, as the DesignStudio manual calls it, as a &quot;stylesheet.&quot;andP;  We perfer to reserve the term &quot;style sheet&quot; for a set of stylesdefining the design of the document as a whole.andP;  DesignStudio doesn't have aterm corresponding to uur usage of &quot;style sheet.&quot;)  You would construct adifferent style for body text, for each type of head, for captions, forfootnotes, and so on.andM;DesignStudio does a lot with its styles.andP;  It takes the concept farther thanother Mac programs.andP;  (In some areas, it even outdistances the desktop stylesheet specialist, Ventura Publisher.andP;  Ventura runs only on DOS and OS/2computers.)andM;One area of strength is in importing styles from Microsoft Word (we wilreturn to this shortly).andP;  Another is in allowing a style to apply to anyselection of text, not just a paragraph.andP;  This is often handy.andM;An unusual feature of designStduio is the ability not to specify items in thestyle.andP;  For example, you can choose &quot;none&quot; for the font, in which caseapplying the style will not change the font of a piece of text, though itwill change all the other properties you have specified.andM;But if you do specify something in a style, DesignStduio will rigidly enforceit.andP;  In making up DesignStudio styles, it is usually important not to specify&quot;plain&quot; as the style of body text, for example, since that will prevent youfrom using bold, italic, or underline for emphasis.andM;Indeed, DesignStudio is not graceful about allowing overrides to its styles.andO;If you try to change something goverened by a style, you will get a warningasking you to first remove the style before making the change.andP;  (Removing thestyle is an extra step.andP;  A more considerate interface would simply ask you toconfirm that you want to override.andP;  We are told that version 1.1, which isexpected in a few weeks, will handle this better.)andM;Many things that are considered style violations by DesignStudio would not beso considered by most observers.andP;  Small caps are considered a violation of astyle's point size specification.andP;  so are fractions, subscripts andsuperscripts.andP;  Even kerning,if it is numerically specified, is a violation ofthe letterspacing parameter of the style.andP;  You have to remove the style, orat least remove some of the specifications, to use these typographic effects.andO;This is a terrific nuisance, we think, and it limits the usefulness ofstyles.andM;We appreciate the hard-nosed attitide of designStudio in letting you knowwhen you are doing something that conflicts with a text style.andP;  But we objectto treating small caps, fractions and precision kerning as style conflicts.andO;This is either bad judgment or an outright bug.andP;  And we think it should beeasier to override styles.andP;  Don't professionals know when it's OK to breakthe rules?andM;We like the ability to apply to style to any selected group of characters,not just a paragraph.andP;  This is particularly valuable with run-in heads, likethe one that begins the paragraph after next.andM;Late in our production of this article, we ran into a bug in DesignStudio'sstyle facility: we changed the font of our first-level heads and found that,in some cases late in the document, the font change occurred, not in the headto which it applied, but to a bit of unrelated body copy a few lines earlierin the file.andP;  The symptoms of this bug, which caused a patch of Helvetica topop up suddently in the midst of a paragraph of Times, were easily put right.andO;But the bug further undermines the usefulness of DesignStudio styles.andM;Text file importing and exporting.andP;  We like the tools DesignStudio providesfor getting text in and out.andP;  It can read the files of all the main Macintoshword-processing packages, and it will preserve most of their formatting andtypography.andM;The export options are limited: either ASCII text with tags corresponding tostyle changes, or just unadorned ASCII text.andP;  Still, the tagged version isvery useful: the file can be edited with any word processing package, savedas ASCII again, and passed back to Designstudio where the originaltypographic styles (or new ones) are restored.andM;We'd eventually like to see Microsoft Rich Text Format as an additionaloutput option, and perhaps Microsoft Word internal format as well.andP;  Thesewould allow more complete two-way transfers with authors and editors usingword-processing software.andM;The ability to import Word style sheets, discussed earlier, is a great assetwhen combined with DesignStudio's own styles.andM;Working with MS Word style sheets.andP;  DesignStudio's text import capabilitieswork with most Mac word-processing packages.andP;  They are discussed under&quot;Importing and exporting files.&quot;andP;  But only with MS Word, version 4, doesDesignStudio go a step farther and import style sheets.andP;  We were particularlyinterested in exploring this facility.andP;  It is very valuable as it stands (noother desktop program does as much) and we think with a little improvement itcould be even more powerful.andM;When you import a Microsoft Word file which has an associated style sheet,the styles get imported too.andP;  The typography defined by the styles remainsthe same as it was in the MS Word original.andP;  But you can change the design ofthe document just by making a few style changes.andM;That's an important feature in a multi-user environment.andP;  If a writer worksin MS Word, but a designer or production person must put the documenttogether in DesignStudio, it is the latter who needs final control overtypography.andP;  It is annoying for a production person to go through a document,changing every single font, size, and format.andP;  Even if the package has asearch and replace feature which can do this, it takes multiple passes.andP;  Itis much easier to make changes to the styles, and  that is what DesignStudiolets you do.andM;It would be even easier to simply apply a pre-existing style to the incomingtext.andP;  For instance, the writer (working in MS Word) could use the stylesHeading 1, Heading 2, Caption, Normal Text, and so on, defining theirtypography in any convenient way.andP;  The designer (working in DesignStudio)could come up with an entirely different set of specifications for Heading 1,Heading 2, etc.andP;  On import, the text could take on the designer's format.andM;It would be nice if DesignStudio worked this way, but it doesn't.andO;DesignStudio simply reproduces the MS Word typography.andP;  If the names of thestyles being imported duplicate ones that already exist in DesignStudio, thenew oens automatically get named.andP;  The only way to apply a pre-existing setof DesignStudio styles to an imported file involves a tedious 3-stepwork-around: Step 1: create the styles in DesignStudio and save a documentcontaining them, then delete the styles.andP;  Step 2: import the MS Word file,then save it as a generically-tagged ASCII File and delete the importedstyles associated with it.andP;  STep 3: retrieve the DesignStudio styles from thefile saved in step 1 and re-import the tagged filed of step 2.andP;  Now the MSWord text will appear, formatted according to the DesignStudio styles.andM;Unfortunately, there is no way to get DesignStudio text back into MS Word'sstyles, though that would be valuable in some environments.andP;  You can,however, export the text as a &quot;tagged&quot; file, with each style change marked bya tag such as &quot;andless;head 1andgt;.&quot;andP;  But we can't really fault DesignStudio here: thisis as much as Ventura can do on export, and more than QuarkXpress (whichcan't even provide tags).andP;  PageMaker's next release, now under beta test,will be able to export its styles back into MS Word styles.andP;  Short of thisprocedure, the alternative would be to go into each style's specificationsand change them individually.andM;Composition featuresandM;We think DesignStudio is off to a good start in its quest for quality oftypography.andP;  While we see many shortcomings in the package, we also recognizethat a high standard of typography is difficult to achieve, and thissoftware, represents a good beginning.andM;DesignStudio's approach to justification.andP;  Designstudio offers two kinds ofjustification: &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;professional.&quot;andP;  Standard is the defaultversion, but professional is much better, we think.andP;  We will explore thedetails of this next month when we compare the leading desktop packages.andM;Both versions suffer an unfortunate bug: when a line starts in one font butcontinues in another (as our lead-in heads do) the line may not justifyproperly.andP;  You will find numerous instances of this problem throughout thereport.andM;Here are the main differences between &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;standard&quot;justification.andP;  Under its standard justification, DesignStudio uses the spacespecified by the font designer as its minimum word space, and it will striveto keep all word spaces as near as possible to this minimum.andP;  It willhyphenate if it can, to keep the spaces down near the minimum size, but itwill never go below that size.andP;  It will never tinker with letterspacing(within the words) to help with justification.andM;Under professional justification, DesignStudio provides the user withconsiderably more control.andP;  The user gets to set the minimum and maximumspace as a percentage of the designer-specified optimum space.andP;  As long asthe space can be maintained between the minimum and maximum, DesignStudiowill never hyphenate.andP;  Furthermore, the user can also specify a range ofletterspacing which DesignStudio can use to help justify a line which wouldotherwise exceed the word-space maximum or minimum.andM;With these controls, the user can make some choices about how lines are to behandled.andP;  For example, in wide-measure setting, with lots of words on a line,it is possible to stay close to the optimum spacing without any problem.andP;  Inthis type of work, we would consider hyphenation to be largely unnecessaryand undesirable.andP;  Most desktop packages will hyphenate even in theseconditions, as will DesignStudio if left in standard mode.andP;  But inprofessional mode, DesignStudio will rarely hyphenate if given a reasonablerange of maximum and minimum (e.g., 125% to 75%).andM;In narrow-measure work, DesignStudio can also do a good job of spacebandcontrol and hyphen avoidance.andP;  But the user should specify a wider range ofword spacing for DesignStudio to work with, and letterspacing needs to bepermitted as well.andP;  In fact, we found that in really narrow setting(averaging around four words per line) we would have liked the option ofsetting the maximum letterspacing even higher than the 125% limit whichDesignStudio imposes.andP;  (The minimum, 75%, is plenty.)andP;  Still, DesignStudiocoped well with the narrow measure.andM;But to take advantage of DesignStudio's controls, you must turn on theprofessional options, and then make the appropriate settings.andM;Ragged setting.andP;  Setting ragged-right type is not as simple as it at firstappears.andP;  The basic idea is that the right margin should be loose andirregular, for an informal look.andP;  This is not always easy to achieve.andM;In setting ragged copy, as in justified setting, DesignStudio providesimproved control.andP;  Here again, the default is &quot;standard&quot; line-breaking: putas many words as possible on each line, using the font's normal word space.andO;This results in line-endings that may not be very ragged.andP;  In shortparagraphs, the lines may sometimes come out all roughly the same length.andO;The text looks justified, or so nearly justified that the eye is engaged inanalyzing the alignment, to the detriment of reading the content of the text.andM;The DesignStudio alternative is &quot;professional&quot; ragged.andP;  DesignStudio treatsthe text as if every second line was set to a narrower column measure.andP;  Theuser gets to specify what percentage of the full measure (down to 50%) thealternate lines will get.andP;  This greatly improves the chances for anattractive rag.andM;This is much better than the DesignStudio &quot;standard&quot; version, and better thanthe offerings of the competing desktop products.andP;  It corresponds to what manydedicated typesetting systems offer.andP;  But it is not the ultimate: withalternating long and short lines, a sawtooth effect can occur which is itselfdistracting.andP;  Some high-end packages provide ways of achieving more randomlength variations.andP;  Still, the DesignStudio approach puts it at the head ofthe desktop class.andM;Hyphenation.andP;  Control of hyphenation in DesignStudio is straightforward.andP;  Youcan turn it on or off, and this can be done on a style-by-style basis if youare using style sheets.andP;  (You'd probably want hyphenation turned off in yourmajor heads, for example.)andM;You can also specify the maximum number of consecutive hyphenated lines, theminimum length of word to be hyphenated, the minimum number of charactersbefore and after the hyphen, whether you will allow capitalized words to bebroken, and whether the last word of a paragraph can be hyphenated (theseselections become standard for all documents until you change them again).andM;DesignStudio provides basic English hyphenation (and other languages are tobe available as options).andP;  You can modify the default hyphenations byentering into a User Dictionary any words you want hyphenated differently ornot at all.andM;DesignStudio allows you to request &quot;preferential hyphens,&quot; which means(according to the manual) that the program will try the &quot;optimal hyphenationpoint for the word&quot; before trying other possible points.andP;  It sounds like agood idea.andP;  However, it is difficult to say how valuable it is.andP;  There isnoway to check the DesignStudio hyphenation list or algorithm to see how thisoptimal point is selected, and the user has no opportunity to select orchange it.andM;Kerning.andP;  DesignStudio offers a good implementation of automatic pairkerning.andP;  For any font, you can call up a table of character pairs.andP;  You canpreview and alter the kerning of any pair, or you can delete pairs or add newones.andP;  You can specify a minimum size below which no kerning will occur (thedefault is 12 points, but we would set it lower--we like to see kerningespecially in text sizes).andM;Interactive kerning is also supported.andP;  You select the second of the twocharacters in the text and adjust the space by typing a number (inthousandths of ems) in the Horizontal Spacing dialog box.andP;  A shortcut, whichmost users will appreciate, allows kerning to be done visually by theCommand-Left Arrow key combination.andP;  Each press takes out 5% of an em.andP;  Butwe wish the increment were finer: 5% of an em is a relatively coarseadjustment.andM;Curiously, numeric specification of kerning is not permitted where there is astyle in effect, but interactive kerning is allowed.andP;  And there is no way tosay you &quot;don't care&quot; about letterspacing changes while leaving the rest ofthe style intact.andP;  The unfortunate result is that if you want the precisionof numeric kerning specification in your job, you will not be able to useDesignStudio's styles.andM;Tracking, character-space reduction and letterspacing.andP;  Now we move on toadjustments of character spacing that apply uniformly to an entire block oftext.andP;  The terms for this adjustment are in disarray, so again we must take amoment to say what we mean by various words.andP;  The concepts we use are for themost part the traditional ones in typesetting.andM;Most fonts needs space removed from between the letters when they are used inlarger sizes.andP;  There are three different ways of addressing this need.andM;* One way is to reduce the spacing in a range of text that has been selected.andO;We'd call that &quot;local character-space reduction.&quot;andP;  (This is what QuarkXpresscalls &quot;tracking.&quot;)andM;* The second approach applies only to a given font in a specific size,wherever it occurs in the document.andP;  This we would call &quot;globalcharacter-space reduction.&quot;andP;  (This is what Ventura Publisher calls&quot;tracking.&quot;)andM;* The third type is based on the idea that the space removed should vary withthe font and point size.andP;  The larger the size, the proportionately greaterthe space removed.andP;  This size-related adjustment, which must be doneautomatically by the system, is what we call &quot;tracking.&quot;andM;In this third type, a given relationship between point size and space removalwe call a &quot;track.&quot;andP;  You may need several different tracks depending on thelooseness or tightness of the typesetting in the projects you do.andP;  A loosetrack might be for textbooks, a tighter one for annual reports, and a verytight one (perhaps even with characters touching in all sizes) for someadvertising work.andP;  Each track covers all point sizes.andM;In the looser tracks, it may be desirable to actually expand the spacing invery small sizes (say, below six points).andP;  That would still be included in&quot;tracking&quot; to us.andM;On the other hand, when space between characters is expanded for estheticreasons, that is &quot;letterspacing.&quot;andM;DesignStudio offers tracking, as we use the term, and it offers threedifferent tracks.andP;  It was the first desktop package to do this (but PageMaker4.0 is right behind).andP;  Unfortunately, DesignStudio's tracking doesn't work.andO;Try as we might, with various tracks and various settings, we couldn't get20-point type any tighter with tracking than it was without.andP;  Most settingsmade it even looser.andP;  This bug leaves the tracking feature useless.andP;  (It willbe fixed in version 1.1, we are told.)andM;If it worked, DesignStudio's approach to tracking would allow expansion ofspacing in small sizes if you want it.andP;  That is a useful feature.andP;  If itworked properly, the tracking facility would be comparable to that of mostdedicated typesetting systems, and the user interface for setting it up iseasier to manage than any of them.andP;  We look forward to getting a fix for thisbug.andM;DesignStudio also supports character-space reduction, both local and global,and this does work.andP;  The local version applies to any range of text, down totwo characters.andP;  We only wish the package didn't ask you to specify it as thefraction of an em that you want to &quot;track,&quot; thereby continuing the confusionof terminology.andM;Letterspacing is well handled by DesignStudio.andP;  In setting up thespecifications for a style or a selected block of text, you can add aspecific number of thousandths of an em to the space between the letters.andP;  Itworks the same way as the character-space reduction adjustment, only inreverse.andM;Tabular typesetting.andP;  Tabular support in DesignStudio is basic.andP;  It is easyenough to set up columns, and you can do this interactively (with the mouse)or by typing in specifications.andP;  Alignment in each column can be right, left,centered, decimal-aligned or justified.andP;  As long as items don't wrap to asecond line and don't straddle multiple columns, things are fine.andM;But complex tables are a chore.andP;  There isn't an easy way to make an entryspan multiple columns.andP;  And there is almost no support for running text incolumns.andP;  To create running text in two columns, for example, you would haveto type the first line of the first column, a tab, the first line of thesecond column, and then a carriage return.andP;  Then you would type the secondline of each column.andP;  If, for some reason, you needed to change columnwidths, you would have to start over.andM;There is no ability to delete or swap columns of text.andM;Import of tabular text from word processing packages works fine as long asthe text does not wrap in a column or straddle columns.andM;Fractions.andP;  DesignStudio recognizes the need for tools to set fractions.andO;We're grateful: PageMaker and Xpress don't address this yet.andP;  For stand-alonefractions it is of course possible to use the slash character (or &quot;shillingstroke&quot;) thus: 13/16.andP;  This has traditionally been called a &quot;shilling&quot;fraction.andP;  Although it isn't handsome, it works.andP;  It creates no problem forany package.andM;But &quot;mixed numbers&quot; with a whole number and a fraction together, cause aproblem: how do you separate the whole number from the numerator of thefraction?andP;  You can use a word space, but the separation may not be clear:8-13/16 may look like 8-13/16.andP;  You can use a hyphen: 8-13/18.andP;  But thatlooks awkward and is easily confused with subtraction.andP;  You can get a fontsupplement that has common fractions built in as single characters.andP;  (Thistype of fraction is traditionally called a &quot;piece&quot; fraction.)andM;But few people could afford to invest in fraction fonts to match each oftheir text fonts, even if they were available.andP;  The more general solution isto reduce the point size of the fraction, raise the numerator above thebaseline, and use a different character (the fraction bar) as the separator:8-13/16.andP;  This is sometimes called a &quot;built&quot; fraction.andM;DesignStudio makes built fractions easy.andP;  You type the numerator, thefraction bar (Shift-Option-1) and the denominator.andP;  Then you select thefraction and choose &quot;make fraction&quot; from the Text menu.andP;  DesignStudio doesthe rest.andM;We applaud the provision of built fractions.andP;  The implementation has a coupleof problems, however.andP;  First, DesignStudio considers the change in point sizeand baseline to be a violation of the current style (if any), so you have toremove the style before you can have the fraction.andP;  We consider this a bug inthe style facility: it should allow fractions without complaint.andM;The other problem is that fractions in large point sizes are not wellhandled.andP;  The change in point size is always minus two points, and the changeis baseline is always two points up, regardless of the size of the text.andO;That's fine for text sizes, but not for headline type.andP;  The size change andthe baseline shift ought to be proportional to the type size.andP;  Unfortunately,these parameters cannot be altered by the user.andP;  Here are samples in 7,9-1/2, 18, and 36 points.andP;  8-13/16, 8-13/16, 8-13/16, 8-13/16andM;Subs, supers.andP;  Subscripts and superscripts are handled by changing the pointsize and shifting the baseline.andP;  There is no tool to help you do this, butyou can set up a style which includes a smaller point size than your bodytext and a baseline shift.andP;  You can apply that style just to the characters(numbers, usually) that need to be raised or lowered.andM;This approach works, but we would rather see direct support of subs andsupers as a function of the base font and point size.andP;  Then, a style changeto the body text would change the subs and supers correspondingly.andM;Search and replace.andP;  DesignStudio provides an excellent search-and-replacefacility.andP;  The search can be restricted to a specified style or a set offormatting criteria.andP;  The replacement string can take on a specified style orformat.andP;  The search can cover the whole document, or it can be restricted tothe current block, to the chain of blocks of which the current one is part,or to a selected area of text.andM;When using the &quot;replace&quot; option, you can replace only the current occurrenceor all occurrences of the string.andP;  You can choose to make the searchcase-sensitive or not, and the replace function will always supply thecorresponding capitalization.andM;In addition to the normal text characters, special codes let you search fortabs, carriage returns, new-line characters, fixed spaces, or any ASCII codespecified in decimal or hexadecimal form.andP;  You can choose as the replacementstring the current contents of the clipboard.andM;Change case.andP;  Sometimes you may have a file with heads in all caps when youneed caps and lower case (or vice versa).andP;  That is when DesignStudio's&quot;change case&quot; feature can help.andP;  You select &quot;change case to&quot; from the Textmenu, and you get five submenu choices: Sentence caps, all caps, all lower,word caps and small caps.andP;  All caps and all lower are self-explanatory.andO;Sentence caps capitalizes after punctuation; word caps capitalizes after eachspace.andP;  Small caps capitalizes all letters and reduces their point size totwo-thirds of the original.andM;We're glad DesignStudio has a change-case feature, but we wish it were astyle-sheet selection so you could apply it globally to a whole style.andP;  As itstands, every occurrence would have to be selected and changed individually.andM;The small-caps feature is not well implemented.andP;  It should only affect thelower-case letters, not the caps.andP;  But it reduces the size of caps as well.andO;It may create a conflict with a style sheet, since it amounts to a localpoint-size change.andP;  You have to remove the style from the selected text (ortake the point size out of the style sheet) before you can get your smallcaps.andP;  Small caps should be built right into the style sheet, and they shouldnot be considered a point-size change.andM;Glossary entries.andP;  You can store text you may want to re-use as a glossaryentry.andP;  All the typographic formatting stays with the text.andM;The glossary stays with the document when you store it.andP;  But you can useglossary entries from a different document without having to open thatdocument.andP;  Glossary entries can be used to store logos, paragraphs ofboilerplate text, or other items that might need to be re-used.andM;In addition to text glossary entries, DesignStudio supports &quot;object&quot; glossaryentries.andP;  These can be composed of objects of any type, including blocks oftext, pictures and created graphics.andM;What's missing in DesignStudio's typography?andP;  We have described so far a verycapable package with a number of features that set it apart from the desktoppublishing pack.andP;  But we return to the question of whether DesignStudiodeserves to be considered as &quot;professional&quot; software.andM;If it truly wants to earn the approval of typesetting professionals, Letrasetmust add some features that are missing today:andM;* Obviously, the tracking feature must be fixed.andM;* Several features like tabular setting and small caps, are in need ofsubstantial improvement.andM;* DesignStudio needs proper support for expanding and condensing type.andM;* Ligatures are character combinations, such as &quot;fi,&quot; which are usuallytypeset as a single combined character.andP;  In a professional package, ligaturesshould be automatically substituted, on output, for the individualcharacters.andP;  DesignStudio doesn't do this.andP;  (A really good package will alsobreak ligatures apart when hyphenation calls for it or when letterspacingspreads the surrounding characters.)andM;* When you change from italic to Roman (plain) text, you often need toprovide a little extra space.andP;  This is called the &quot;italic correction&quot; andtop-quality software can provide it automatically.andM;* Look down the edge of a long column of justified type.andP;  Notice how the edgedoesn't really look straight if the last character on the line is a period,comma or hyphen?andP;  The edge of the column seems to deviate slightly inwardwhere these small characters occur.andP;  The same effect arises with quotationmarks occurring at either margin.andP;  The typesetting feature known as &quot;hungpunctuation&quot; is designed to compensate for this irregularity by lettingcertain characters stick out into the margin.andP;  It is a hallmark of the finesttypesetting systems.andP;  DesignStudio doesn't have it.andM;A good implementation of hung punctuation will allow control over the amountby which each character is &quot;hung&quot; into the margin.andM;* DesignStudio has no special support for math equations.andP;  This is not animportant lack in the desktop market (Ventura does provide it) but manydedicated systems have good support for math, and their users often need it.andM;* While we are discussing missing features, we might as well mentionautomatic pagination.andP;  Perhaps it isn't realistic to expect this ofDesignStudio, since not every dedicated system has pagination.andP;  But many do,and so (to a degree) does Ventura Publisher.andP;  DesignStudio does not.andM;For the record, here are some of the major features we like to see in apagination package: automatic breaking of columns and pages, with controlover widows and orphan lines; control over where extra leading will be added,if needed; control over the alignment of baselines in adjacent columns;options about whether problem pages and spreads can be set a line long orshort; automatic placement and numbering of footnotes; automatic placement ofillustrations that are &quot;anchored&quot; to a specific passage in the text; supportfor one-column and two-column graphics in two-column pages, with facilitiesfor expressing preference about their locations on the page; automatic index,table of contents and cross-reference generation.andM;Perhaps the developers of DesignStudio, if they really aspire to satisfy theneeds of the professional, will add these features to a future release.andM;'Objects,' graphics and imagesandM;Anything you can place on a page in DesignStudio--text blocks, scanned art,or art created with drawing tools--is an &quot;object.&quot;andP;  Objects have a long listof specifications, including position on the page, size, angle of rotation,whether text should run around them, and several others.andM;You can manipulate objects directly with the mouse, but you can alsomanipulate them by editing their specifications.andP;  This is often handy whenprecision is required.andM;Objects can be assembled into groups which can then be manipulated as a unit.andO;They can later be &quot;ungrouped.&quot;andM;The ability to rotate objects, either interactively with the mouse or vianumeric specification, is an important feature of DesignStudio.andP;  It allowsyou to rotate text blocks and images, which most packages can't do.andP;  Butdon't expect high performance: rotation is slow, especially for scannedimages.andP;  (Some actual timings appear near the end of the article.)andM;When several objects are close together on the page, it is easy toaccidentally move one when you are trying to manipulate another one.andO;DesignStudio provides a way of locking objects in place so this doesn'thappen.andP;  We found it very valuable.andM;DesignStudio provides a powerful tool for aligning objects with each other.andO;It is very similar to the one in ReadySetGo.andP;  You select all the objects youwant to align, then select the type of alignment from a dialog box.andP;  You canchoose top, down, left or right alignment; or you can align objects on theircenters, either vertically or horizontally.andM;Drawing tools.andP;  Though DesignStudio is not intended as a drawing package, itdoes provide some basic tools.andP;  You can create rectangles, ovals, polygonsand straight lines.andP;  These can be stretched, sized and rotated.andP;  They can befilled with colors or tints, and their borders can be given colors, patternsand specific thicknesses.andP;  Lines can be made into arrows by addingarrowheads, and DesignStudio gives you control over the shape of thearrowhead, a nice touch.andM;If your drawing needs go much beyond this, you would probably create yourartwork in a different package (such as Illustrator or FreeHand) and importit.andM;Rules are created like any other art: they are drawn in place on the page.andO;You can select rule weights down to 1/8 point (or specify a custom weight)and you can choose styles including dashed rules and double (Scotch) ruleslike this:andM;Sometimes a design calls for rules between text elements or around subheads.andO;It would be nice if such rules would travel with the text when its lengthchanges, but this doesn't happen in DesignStudio.andP;  The rules stay put and thetext flows over them.andM;Images.andP;  Imported images are well supported in DesignStudio.andP;  The package canuse images in MacPaint, PICT (MacDraw), EPSF, RIFF, and TIFF formats.andP;  Imagesstored in the last three of these formats are not actually brought into thedocument (since they are often very large).andP;  A screen-resolution image isdisplayed, but the full image data remains in its disk file, which must stayin the same folder with the document.andP;  DesignStudio has a virtual-memorycapability for working with images that are larger than available memory.andM;If you have a gray-scale or color monitor, DesignStudio gives you two ways tospeed up the display process.andP;  You can choose &quot;Fast Halftones,&quot; whichsacrifices detail for speed, and you can reduce the number of gray levels onyour display.andP;  If speed is of the essence, and you don't need to work withthe actual image displayed, you can choose &quot;greek picture&quot; and DesignStudiowill display a uniform pattern of wavy lines instead of the image.andM;Basic brightness, contrast and gray-scale manipulations are available withinDesignStudio.andP;  You can also do posterization and solarization effects, andyou can turn a positive image into a negative.andP;  More elaborate imageadjustment would be done with an external package, such as Letraset'sImageStudio or ColorStudio or a competing package.andP;  Color separation supportis provided by a separate annex, DesignStudio Separator (see The LatestWord).andP;  We have not tried to assess the quality of halftones or separationsfrom DesignStudio.andM;OutputandM;Like other desktop publishing programs, DesignStudio targets PostScriptoutput devices, and that is primarily what we used it with.andP;  But it alsoworked well with the QuickDraw-based HP DeskWriter, at least for pagescontaining horizontal text and no scanned images.andP;  There is no support fortraditional (non-PostScript) typesetters.andM;Various printing options support special needs.andP;  For large-format output on asmall-format device, DesignStudio will break the image into multiple tiles.andO;For spot color, each color can be output separately, or all of them can beoutput together.andP;  Registration marks can be added to color-separated pages,and the name of each separation can be printed outside the image area.andM;For the early stages of document design, there are &quot;draft&quot; and &quot;thumbnail&quot;printing options.andP;  The former produces full-size pages, but without theactual images in place.andP;  The latter is reduced-size thumbnail images.andP;  Bothare much faster than full-size, full-quality output.andM;ExtensibilityandM;Aside from normal upgrades, there are two routes to extending DesignStudiothat are built into the product.andP;  They are called &quot;annexes&quot; and&quot;DesignScript.&quot;andM;Annexes.andP;  Annexes are a method of directly extending DesignStudiofunctionality.andP;  They are analogous to Quark's Xtensions, which have provedvery valuable in adapting that package to a variety of publishing tasks.andM;Some annexes come with DesignStudio right out of the box.andP;  For example,automatic pair kerning and tracking are both implemented as annexes.andP;  Alsoprovided as annexes are utility programs for listing the fonts and imagefiles used by a document.andP;  (This is important if you want to take a documentto a service bureau for output.)andM;Other annexes are extra-cost add-ons.andP;  DesignScript (see below) is anexample.andP;  Another is the newly-announced DesignStudio Separator (described inThe Latest Word).andM;Though these annexes have come from Letraset, other companies will beoffering them too.andP;  Crosfield will offer a version of StudioLink, aninterface with its high-end color systems, in the form of an annex.andP;  Otherannexes are under development.andM;Letraset says it is not difficult to develop annexes.andP;  The process basicallyinvolves writing a program in &quot;C&quot; which can call upon various DesignStudioroutines to interact with a DesignStudio document.andP;  Letraset gives developersa day of background orientation on annex-writing and tries to keep enoughcontrol of the process to ensure that the DesignStudio user interface ispreserved.andM;DesignScript.andP;  A pioneering feature of DesignStudio is a built-in programminglanguage called DesignScript.andP;  It is actually an &quot;annex,&quot; but it is importantenough to deserve separate discussion.andP;  The language permits the creation ofcomplex documents via the execution of a set of commands in a text file.andM;DesignScript commands let you do things like set up pages, create text andgraphic areas and specify styles.andP;  You can format text, place images on thepage and create rules.andP;  You can do, by DesignScript program, most of thethings you can do interactively using DesignStudio.andM;The initial version of the facility lets you create documents based onexternal sources of text.andP;  For example, one of the sample scripts provided byLetraset converts a HyperCard rolodex file into a typeset directory.andP;  Anothermerges a table from a spreadsheet into a document.andM;Once created, documents built with DesignScript can be worked withinteractively just like any other documents.andM;DesignScript will surely be a great time-saver in some repetitiousapplications like directory publishing, and even the limited initial versionof the language will help there.andP;  But future versions promise even more.andO;Letraset will add more programming features, including conditionalprocessing, looping constructs, and variables, and these should allow thesavvy user to automate fairly complicated formatting processes.andM;Another important addition will be the ability to export an existing documentas a DesignScript file.andP;  With this facility, an initial version of a documentcan be constructed interactively and its script saved.andP;  By editing this savedscript, the user will be able to produce a new script that can producesimilar documents automatically.andM;We look forward to the evolution of DesignScript into what could potentiallybe a very important new tool.andM;PricingandM;DesignStudio costs $795.andP;  Users of ReadySetGo 4.5 can upgrade for $100, or$150 after March 31.andP;  (This is a change from the initial upgrade fee of$325.)andP;  Users of older versions should call Letraset.andP;  DesignScript is a $125option.andP;  DesignStudio Separator has an introductory price of $395.andM;ProblemsandM;We were pleased with the stability of DesignStudio: the program rarelycrashed.andP;  We did have several seemingly random crashes with Multifinderrunning, but when we turned it off, the package was very solid.andP;  Apart fromthe Multifinder problem, the only time we hung the program was when weinadvertently linked the last block of text in a chain back to the first one,creating and endless loop.andM;But though crashes were rare, there are a number of lesser bugs.andP;  Probablythe most disturbing is the failure of justification on lines that begin boldand then change to Roman.andP;  We could find no work-around for this.andP;  Nor couldwe get the tracking feature to work.andP;  Under certain conditions, changing theparameters of a style affected the wrong text.andP;  The importing process fromMicrosoft Word will not complete successfully if you have saved the file with&quot;fast save,&quot; which is the normal method.andP;  You have to deselect the fast-saveoption in Word before saving the file.andP;  We consider the conflicts betweenstyles and small caps, fractions, subscripts and superscripts to be a bug.andM;Letraset will address several of these problems with version 1.1, whichshould be available within a few weeks.andM;DocumentationandM;DesignStudio comes with a User's Guide in a 3-ring binder and a smallerspiral-bound tutorial.andP;  Both are very well done.andP;  The first two-thirds of theUser's Guide explains all of the package's features, step by step; the lastthird is a reference section and glossary.andP;  There is a good index.andP;  Thewriting is clear and the layout is attractive.andP;  It is an impressive piece ofdocumentation, especially considering the complexity of the package itsupports.andM;Where it fitsandM;DesignStudio occupies a niche at the high end of the desktop spectrum.andO;Compared with ReadySetGo, its typography is much more sophisticated and itsupports some additional functions, such as rotation.andP;  But ReadySetGo is lessexpensive and it will run on a less powerful machine.andP;  Evidently Letrasetwill continue to develop both packages, but DesignStudio will specificallytarget the &quot;power users&quot; with the latest machines and the highest typographicrequirements.andM;We are still in the process of evaluating how DesignStudio compares with thenew versions of PageMaker and Xpress and with Ventura Publisher.andP;  Our nextissue will contain a detailed exploration of this topic, along with a reviewof the latest Xpress features.andM;DesignStudio's typography still needs a lot of refinement before it will beready for direct comparison with commercial-quality systems like Magna,Quadex and Penta.andP;  A good bit of the typographic gulf could be bridged bycorrecting the bugs, fixing up tabular setting and tracking and by addingautomatic ligatures and hung punctuation.andM;Despite its share of quirks, we like what has been done with this initialrelease of DesignStudio.andP;  We would love to see DesignStudio evolve into aproduct that can set type with the very best systems.andP;  We know it ispossible, and a good start has been made.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
