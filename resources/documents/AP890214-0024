Hastings,impeached last year by the House of Representatives, is asking theSenate to dismiss 16 of the 17 articles of impeachment.   The 52-year-old Florida jurist sought dismissal of 15 counts inwhich the House accused Hastings of conspiring with a Washingtonattorney to receive a $150,000 payoff in exchange for a guaranteethat two racketeers would not serve time in prison.   Hastings was acquitted in a 1983 criminal trial on that charge,but the articles of impeachment also accuse him of making falsestatements and fabricating evidence in the trial.   Hastings contended that an impeachment trial on those countsconstitutes double jeopardy in view of his acquittal in criminalcourt and also denies him due process because witnesses have diedand records have been lost.   The motion seeks dismissal of the final, 17th article on groundsthat it is a ``catch-all'' count aimed at allowing the Senate toremove Hastings from the bench with a finding that he is unfit evenif a majority finds him innocent on each of the 16 other articles.   The only article of impeachment which Hastings didn't seek tohave dismissed is one that accuses him of disclosing secret wiretapinformation in an unrelated investigation to Steve Clark, the mayorof Dade County, Fla.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>FTC Says Company Will Donate Money to Medical Associations</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Pittsburgh company will donate $600,000 tothree medical associations to settle complaints of falseadvertising, according to the Federal Trade Commission.   General Nutrition Corp. signed a consent decree under which itpledged not to make false or unsubstantiated claims about itsproducts, the FTC said Monday.   Signing the decree is not an admission of any violations.Violation of its terms can mean a fine of $10,000.   The commission said the company made false and unsubstantiatedclaims that its ``Healthy Greens'' diet supplement was effective inreducing the risk of cancer.   Also, the commission said, the company falsely claimed that sixother supplements, mainly sold to body builders, promoted weightloss, increased muscle growth and slowed aging.   The consent order was approved by a 3-1 vote. Commissioner MargotMachol did not participate. The dissenter, Commissioner Mary L.Azcuenaga, said the order left the company ``free to sell productsit knows are deceptively labeled.''   The money will be split among the American Heart Association, theAmerican Diabetes Association and the American Cancer Society.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>No Halt To Government Sales of Gas, Despite `Serious' Shortage</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Energy Department says it will keep sellingtritium to private customers despite what it calls an approachingshortage of the radioactive gas used in manufacturing most U.S.nuclear weapons.   The government has been selling tritium to private corporationsand research groups, both domestic and foreign, for decades. Thepractice has come under review since the nation's only maker of thegas was shut down last spring.   The Energy Department, in charge of making all U.S. nuclearwarheads and their components, has cited the risk of a tritiumsqueeze in urging Congress to approve construction of twonew-generation tritium-producing reactors to replace the aging andinefficient Savannah River reactor complex near Aiken, S.C.   The Savannah River reactors were closed down last spring forsafety-related reasons, and no firm timetable for resuming operationhas been set.   Phil Keif, a department spokesman, said Monday officials decidedto continue the tritium sales since the amounts involved are ``asmall piece'' of total supplies, and since the government expects atleast one of the three Savannah River reactors to be restarted byyear's end.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>Illinois Company to Make Flour from Corn Cobs</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Mount Pulaski, Ill., company plans to make ano-calorie, high-fiber flour from corn cobs for use in fiber-richbread, cereals, doughnuts and other foods, the AgricultureDepartment says.
