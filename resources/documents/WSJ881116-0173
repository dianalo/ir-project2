Mr. Smith discusses the perverse consequences that can result from providing explicit 100% deposit guarantees to troubled financial institutions. He also notes concerns about Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. settlement practices that treat certain institutions as &quot;too big to fail.&quot;    We share Mr. Smith's concerns. We recently distributed a study, &quot;The Texas Thrift Situation: Implications for the Texas Financial Industry,&quot; that identifies some of the negative consequences that special assistance to troubled financial institutions, including 100% deposit guarantees, can have on those institutions that have not received the special assistance.    Our study indicates that concerns about the most troubled banks and thrifts in Texas have spilled over to the stronger institutions. This is evidenced by the interest-rate premiums that are now required on deposits of virtually all the banks and thrifts in Texas, including those with higher average capital ratios than banks and thrifts outside the state.    During the first quarter of 1988, the average premium on interest-bearing deposits at Texas thrifts was 74 basis points, with the weakest thrifts paying 132 basis points more for their funds than thrifts outside Texas. The top quarter of Texas thrifts, with an average capital ratio of 8%, paid 33 basis points more for their funds, even though the average capital ratio of thrifts outside Texas was only 3.7%. At Texas banks, the average premium was 31 basis points. The weakest banks paid 47 basis points more for their funds relative to banks outside Texas, while the top quarter of Texas banks, with an average capital ratio of 13.3%, paid 18 basis points more for their funds. The average capital ratio for banks outside Texas was 9.7%.    These figures suggest that competitive pressures from the state's most troubled financial institutions are requiring the stronger institutions to pay higher interest rates on their deposits to retain adequate funding. This process not only weakens the financial condition of the solvent banks and thrifts in Texas, it also penalizes the stronger institutions because of the problems of the most troubled institutions.    We share Mr. Smith's position that the current system of federal deposit guarantees needs to be reformed. Policies that have removed incentives for depositors to reallocate their deposits from the most troubled financial institutions have also removed a market process that contributes to the overall safety and soundness of the financial system.
