The amendment, which the administration says would beunconstitutional, was sparked by Senate Democrats' wrath overPresident Reagan's interpretation of the 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile Treaty. They have charged that he interpreted the pact toobroadly so he could justify development of the ``Star Wars''missile defense system.   Under their proposed attachment to the INF treaty, futureinterpretations would be based not just on the text of the treaty,but also on the voluminous testimony given during weeks ofratification hearings since Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev signed the pact in December.   A congressional source, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthe decision to tack the amendment on was made at a luncheon Fridayattended by Byrd, Foreign Relations Committee chairman ClaibornePell of Rhode Island, Armed Services Committee chairman Sam Nunn ofGeorgia and Intelligence Committee co-chairman David Boren ofOklahoma.   The original author of the proposal was Sen. Joseph Biden Jr.,D-Del.   Their condition will be presented to the foreign relations panelduring consideration of the treaty next week, the source said.   In a commentary attached to the proposed amendment, the senatorshave said their purpose was not to resolve the dispute over the ABMTreaty.   ``Rather the provision is intended to reaffirm certainconstitutional principles which have been brought into questionduring the `reinterpretation' debate,'' the commentary said.   Many Democrats have argued that the ABM treaty, as outlinedduring the ratification hearings in 1972, prevents certain StarWars testing and development. The administration has asserted thatits interpretation _ based on the text and the record ofnegotiations with the Soviets _ permits the development.   The Democratic chairmen already have expressed their support forthe INF treaty provisions, which would eliminate all land-basedmissiles with ranges between 300 and 3,125 miles.   Ratification by the required two-thirds of the Senate isexpected, but the attachments of conditions opposed by theadministration would be a complicating factor that could requirerenegotiations with the Soviets.   In a letter to Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of theforeign relations panel, the White House reiterated its fears aboutthe amendment and said its views were endorsed by the State,Defense and Justice departments and the Arms Control andDisarmament Agency.   The letter, signed by Arthur B. Culvahouse, counsel to thepresident and made public Friday, said the resolution is``seriously flawed.''   He acknowledged that for domestic purposes a president wouldadhere to an interpretation generally agreed to by the Senate, buthe said the proposed amendment would go too far, by binding anadministration to ``all statements made by officials of theexecutive branch during ratification proceedings.''   These would include ``answers to over 1,000 questions submittedby members of the Senate, no matter how trivial or how unimportantthe issue addressed may be to the Senate's advice and consentdeliberations.''   ``The result might be two INF treaties, one binding domesticallyagainst the president and a second one binding internationallybetween the United States and the Soviet Union,'' Culvahouse said.   That would favor Moscow ``because the Soviet Union is not andcannot be bound by our domestic processes.''   The proposal ``only serves the interests of confusion,ambiguity, confrontation and uncertainty,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
