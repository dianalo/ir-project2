The defendants were acquitted by a state court jury on July 15of violating the civil rights of Loyal Garner Jr., a Louisianatruck driver, and state prosecutors now want to try them onfirst-degree murder charges.   The defendants, former Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner, 41,and former Sabine County sheriff's deputies James ``Bo'' Hyden, 34,and Billy Ray Horton, 58, argue that that would violateconstitutional protections against being tried twice for the sameoffense.   Garner, 34, of Florien, La., and two companions were arrestedChristmas night. Garner died two days later, after allegedly beingbeaten in the Sabine County Jail.   Ladner admitted to striking Garner on the head once with a stickbut said he only used force necessary to subdue Garner after Garnerhit him in the head and neck.   State District Judge Joe Tunnell dismissed the defendants'claims last month that the murder trials amount to double jeopardy.Their appeal is to be heard in the state court of appeals hereThursday.   Although the three were tried together in Hemphill on the civilrights violation charges, they face separate murder trials, withLadner's scheduled to start next Monday.   Frank Henderson, an assistant district attorney for SmithCounty, said he doubts the trial will start on time and that thetrials could be consolidated at a later date. The trial's venue waschanged to Tyler from Hemphill, where the civil rights case washeard.   While attorneys are preparing for the legal battle, SabineCounty residents are bracing themselves for a Saturday rallysponsored by the National Association for the Advancement ofColored People in Hemphill.   Vollie Grace, president of the Sabine County chapter of theNAACP, said he's expecting 300 to 500 people at the rally, calledto protest ``the brand and type of justice we're getting in thisarea.''   Grace said he's not expecting any violence but he has contactedofficials with the U.S. Justice Department, who told him they wouldmonitor the situation.   John Hannah, who served as special prosecutor in the state civilrights case, said he will seek federal indictments against the trioon conspiracy to violate civil rights.   Garner's family has sued Ladner, Hyden, Horton and Hemphillofficials over his death. The two men jailed with Garner also havefiled separate suits against the trio plus city and countyofficials.</TEXT></DOC>
