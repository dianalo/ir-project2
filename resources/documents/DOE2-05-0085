<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-0085 </DOCNO><TEXT>A gas chromatographic technique that measures atmospheric concentrationsof peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and NO{sub 2} has been developed that usesluminol-based chemiluminescence for detection. The carrier gas is airthat has been scrubbed by passing it over FeSO{sub 4}, which eliminatesthe need for any compressed gas cylinders. A novel gas sampling systemand time enable variable sample volumes of contaminated air to be injected.Ambient PAN and NO{sub 2} measurements can be made every 40 s with detectionlimits of 0.12 ppb for PAN and 0.2 ppb for NO{sub 2}. Seven other atmosphericspecies, including ozone, gave no interference. Linear response was observedfor NO{sub 2} from 0.2 to 170 ppb and for PAN from 1 to 70 ppb.</TEXT></DOC>
