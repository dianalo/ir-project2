The Foreign Ministry said the attackkilled one person and injured three.   The bombardment was the first since Thursday, when a barrage ofrockets killed at least seven people, including four children. Thelast Soviet troops left Afghanistan on Wednesday.   The Foreign Ministry reported that one rocket today struck near agovernment ministry for refugees in northern Kabul, killing one manand injuring three other people.   Three rockets hit southeastern Kabul, but there were no reportsof casulties.   Earlier, the government displayed a huge cache of arms andexplosives devises and said the guerrillas had planned to use themtoday to attack buildings and bazaars.   The Foreign Ministry took foreign reporters to the headquartersof KHAD, the government's secret police, where it had lined up thewide array of weapons on several tables.   Many had markings from the United States, Britain, Egypt, Sweden,China and Italy. Officials said others were made in Pakistan, wherethe most powerful guerrilla groups are based.   According to Moammad Omar, a state security agent, the weaponswere seized Monday in a well in eastern Kabul.   He said agents captured three guerrilla sympathizers whoconfessed to planning to use the devices to attack governmentbuildings and markets around the city today and Wednesday.   The guerrillas hold most of the countryside, while governmenttroops control major cities.   The 1980 revolt occurred two months after Soviet troopsintervened to bolster a Marxist government in Kabul. Soviet soldiersfired on Moslem protesters who emerged from their homes shouting``God is Great!''   Government officials say dozens of people were killed.   Around the city today, business was brisk in some shops but lightin others. Some closed for the occasion.   Authorities stepped up security around the city, sending moresoldiers to marketplaces.   Omar said security agents received a tip that guerrillas andsympathizers had stored weapons and explosive devices in a well. Hesaid they searched eight days before finding the arms.   Among the weapons were 113 pounds of plastic explosives thatagents said came from Pakistan, Chinese-made hand grenades, Britishmortar shells, Egyptian rockets, Italian fuses for mines, Britishand Pakistani detonators, Swedish circuit testers, ChineseKalashnikov rifles, and British pistols.   There were also political pamphlets.   Officials also showed several fliers they said the guerrillasdistributed in Kabul last week suggesting that rockets attacks wereimminent.   One, printed in English and the local language Dari, said: ``Wewill contine our Jihad (holy war) until the withdrawal of the lastSoviet soldier.''   The final Soviet troops, once estimated at more than 100,000 inAfghanistan, withdrew Wednesday under a U.N.-mediated accord.   President Najib has accused Pakistan of stepping up its supply ofweapons to the guerrillas, who have rejected offers of power-sharingand vowed to overthrow the government.   Over the weekend, Najib declared a state of emergency and shookup his government to consolidate control.</TEXT></DOC>
