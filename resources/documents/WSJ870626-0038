The Kiel Institute for World Economics said the nation's output of goods and services is likely to grow 2.5% in both 1987 and 1988, which exceeds even the government's optimistic target. The DIW Economic Research Institute in West Berlin said the economy will grow only 1% this year but 2% in 1988.    The institutes based their predictions on a recovery in the country's export sector amid a stable U.S. dollar; an increase in investment spending by domestic and foreign companies, and the mild stimulative effect of a tax-cut package that will reduce the nation's tax bill by 14 billion marks ($7.7 billion) in 1988.    The Kiel Institute, known for its conservative stance and its identification with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party, said domestic demand will continue to spur growth. But DIW predicted a slowdown in the country's spending spree that will be offset by a recovery in the export sector. </TEXT></DOC>
