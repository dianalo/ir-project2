The number of Americans aged 5 and under totaled 18.3 million asof 1987, up from 18.2 million in 1986 and just over 18 million theyear before that.   Still, the total is well short of the 20.5 million preschoolersrecorded in 1961, near the end of the post World War II Baby Boom.   Population experts stress that the current surge in tots doesnot constitute another boom, but rather is an ``echo'' of thatearlier one, since the great mass of people born in the two decadesfollowing that war are now producing their own families.   This increase has been underway for several years, with thenumber of Americans under age 5 up by 1.9 million from 1980 to 1987.   Meanwhile, the number aged 5 to 17 has declined in this decade,slipping from 47.4 million in 1980 to 45.3 million in the 1987estimates.   In the same period, those aged 18 to 24 declined from 30.0million to 27.1 million, while all other age groups increased.   Other findings of the study included:   _Alaska and Louisiana both registered population losses for thefirst time in this decade, as the continuing slowdown in the energyindustry affected growth rates in several states. Declinescontinued in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Wyoming.   _Population loss also affected agricultural states, withdeclines reported for Iowa, North Dakota and Nebraska.</TEXT></DOC>
