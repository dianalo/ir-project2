Force</HEAD><BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   British and Australian soldiers weredeployed Monday in the north to monitor the pullout of nationalistguerrillas, and officials said U.N.-supervised independenceelections would go ahead despite recent fighting.   The nearly 100 British and Australian soldiers, members of theU.N. peacekeeping force, arrived in the northern region of Ovamboon Monday for deployment at the checkpoints where guerrillas are toreport Tuesday before they return to bases in Angola.   Louis Peinaar, South Africa-installed administrator of theterritory, said he expected U.N.-supervised elections to be held asscheduled in early November, provided that insurgents of theSouth-West Africa People's Organization withdrew.   In the United Nations, the president of the Security Councilsaid all parties concerned intend ``to stick to the procedureswhich were agreed'' on the turnover of Namibia to a black-majoritygovernment after 74 years of South African rule.   ``We're looking forward once again to elections in Namibia andto full independence,'' said Soviet Ambassador Alexander M.Belonogov, who is council president this month.   Chester Crocker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state whomediated negotiations to clear the way for independence, said inWindhoek that diplomatic pressure has forced SWAPO to order thewithdrawal.   South Africa said 1,900 guerrillas crossed the border fromAngola starting April 1, the day a cease-fire was to have takeneffect. Heavy fighting continued for a week, leaving 263 guerrillasand 27 security forces dead by South African count.   SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma ordered the insurgents to leave Namibiaon Sunday. Crocker, referring to this order, said SWAPO ``didn'treverse itself voluntarily'' and indicated that Angola and itsCuban allies had persuaded Nujoma to order the retreat.   Starting Tuesday, the guerrillas are to report to border postsand assembly points so that members of the U.N. monitoring forcecan escort them to bases in Angola.   South African, Cuban and Angolan officials agreed at a weekendmeeting that the guerrillas could have safe passage out untilSaturday. Soviet and U.S. officials, including Crocker, observedthe meeting at a Namibian game lodge.   Police reported calm in the northern bush for the second dayMonday, and said they were waiting to see whether the guerrillasobeyed the withdrawal orders. The lull follows the fiercestfighting in the 23-year war for this mineral-rich territory, whichSouth Africa has ruled since World War I.   Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, the senior U.N. official inNamibia, said messages were being broadcast on radio advising theguerrillas to go to churches as a preliminary step before reportingto the designated assembly points.   He told journalists no official cease-fire was in effect, ``butthe South Africans have undertaken to restrain their forces.''   Ahtisaari declined to blame anyone for the near-collapse of theindependence plan.   ``There has been a major mistake made,'' he said. ``But my jobis to build bridges and get this plan back on track.''   The United Nations has authorized a peacekeeping force of 4,650soldiers for Namibia, but only about 1,000 have arrived.   South Africa contends SWAPO's incursion violated an agreementthat the insurgents would remain at bases at least 100 miles insideAngola until mid-May.   Nujoma maintained that many of the guerrillas had been insideNamibia before April and should be allowed to set up bases in theterritory.   SWAPO had been favored to win the most votes in pre-independenceelections for an assembly that will draft a constitution.   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December whenSouth Africa, Angola and Cuba signed a regional peace plan. Cubaagreed to withdraw 50,000 Cuban troops who have helpedMarxist-ruled Angola battle U.S.-backed rebels. In exchange, SouthAfrica agreed to stop supporting the Angolan rebels and allowNamibia to become independent.</TEXT></DOC>
