We studied the usefulness of MRI in the diagnosis and treatmentof these tumors. Based on our results, we reached the following conclusions.1) Since bone artifacts do not intrude, the diagnosis of microadenomawas facilitated. 2) Comprehension of the anatomical positions of surroundingtissues, including the tumor and the optic nerve, the optic chiasma andlarge blood vessels, are cleary identified. 3) Diagnosis of intratumorhemorrhaging, especially repeated hemorrhaging, was facilitated. Neuroophthalmologically,contributes to the elucidation of the tumor's pathological effects onthe development of optical signs and symptoms. Also, a clear depictionof the position of the tumor and its relation to the peripheral tissuesprovides useful information to the surgeon before an operation. 4) Theweak point of MRI is the poor demonstration of calcification and bonedisintegration. 5) Topics still to be considered in regard to MRI isthe difficulty of differential diagnosis of tumors before an operation.</TEXT></DOC>
