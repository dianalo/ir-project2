(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Holly Farms Corp. may have found a whiteknight buyer in ConAgra Inc., but a counterattack by hostile suitorTyson Foods Inc. is not out of the question, analysts say.   Holly Farms announced Thursday the poultry processor had agreedto a $1 billion stock swap buyout by Omaha, Neb.-based ConAgra, amajor diversified food company.   The acquisition, which must be approved by Holly Farms andConAgra shareholders, if successful would thwart the hostile $52 ashare offer valued at $941 million being waged by Tyson, ofSpringdale, Ark.   Tyson issued a statement saying it would have no immediatecomment on the proposal, and analysts speculated it was not out ofthe picture yet.   ``I don't think it's clear cut right now,'' said NapoleonOverton, an analyst with Morgan Keegan Co. in Memphis.   ConAgra, a diversified company with more than 60 percent of itsbusiness in prepared foods, is offering an exchange of stock, thevalue of which will be figured in January, while Tyson is offeringcash now, Overton said.   Tyson's offer was to expire today, but Overton said Tyson mightbe ready to raise it.   ``They definitely look like they're willing to pay $54 a share incash. That's the key point, no matter whether there is a formal bidon the table or not,'' he said.   John McMillin, an analyst with Predential-Bache Securities in NewYork, said ConAgra's offer would amount to $55 a share for HollyFarms 18.1 million shares of common stock, based on Thursday'smarket prices.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Holly Farms fell 87{cents a share to $51.87{ while ConAgra dropped $1.25 a share to$27.62{.   McMillin said it was clear that Holly Farms management, led bycompany president R. Lee Taylor II, will continue to oppose Tyson.   He said he believed that ConAgra had the upper hand because ofits operating style, in which each operating division is given wideautonomy.   Market analysts say Taylor and Tyson Chairman Don Tyson havedifferent business styles, and McMillin said Holly Farms' managementlikely would be replaced if Tyson took over.   Holly Farms has 50 percent of its business in processed chickenand the ConAgra acquisition would push Holly Farms' share of thebranded chicken market from 18 percent to about 25 percent, McMillinsaid.   ``It gives a lot of clout within the supermarket,'' he said.   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processer, produces 14million pounds of chicken a week.   Market observers say Holly Farms has been looking for a friendlytakeover since Tyson on Oct. 18 made its initial offer of $45 plus aquarter share of Tyson stock for each Holly Farms share.   ``I would suspect that Holly Farms approached ConAgra,'' Overtonsaid.   The acquisition agreement calls for exchanging 1.875 to 2 sharesof ConAgra stock for each share of Holly Farms stock. Holly Farmshas 18.1 million shares outstanding.   ``This transaction provides higher value for our shareholders,significantly higher value, than the other available alternative,''said Ted Bailey, a spokesman for Holly Farms.   Holly Farms had total sales last year of $1.6 billion whileConAgra registered total sales of $9.5 billion. Tyson had sales of$1.8 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
