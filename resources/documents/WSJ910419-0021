According to U.S. officials, the Iraqi governmentresponded to yesterday's deadline for such disclosures bysending two letters. One, sent to Director-General Hans Blixof the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, deniedthat Iraq had any &quot;nuclear weapons-useable material&quot; anddidn't disclose the whereabouts of highly enriched uraniumreactor fuel the country is known to have.</LP><TEXT>   A second letter, sent to the United Nations in New York,denied that Iraq had biological weapons, admitting only thatit has missiles and chemical weapons technology. But theletter apparently didn't provide any details.   According to one official familiar with the Iraqiresponse, it fell far short of the U.N. agreement that Iraqsigned on April 3. Under the agreement, Baghdad was requiredto provide detailed inventories of weapons-related materials,including &quot;locations, amounts and types.&quot;   One U.S. official said the response &quot;doesn't augur wellfor other things if this is going to be their generalattitude.&quot; He said the letters, written in Arabic, complainedbitterly of discrimination against Iraq. &quot;This is likely togo back and forth for some time,&quot; said another official. Bothofficials asked not to be identified.   The matter of most immediate concern to U.S. officials andthe IAEA, which is an affiliate of the U.N., is thewhereabouts of 49 pounds of highly enriched uranium sold toIraq in two batches by France and the Soviet Union for use intwo research reactors in Tuwaitha, a suburb of Baghdad.   According to Carson Mark, a former U.S. nuclear weaponsdesigner, the fuel could be fabricated into at least onenuclear weapon. But he added: &quot;The likelihood that they couldmake such a bomb very quickly is not very great.&quot;   Iraq is suspected of having a nuclear-weapons designfacility, a uranium enrichment laboratory and uranium mines,none of which were disclosed in the letter to the IAEA.   IAEA officials in Vienna were still studying Iraq's letterlast night and wouldn't disclose its contents. Under theIAEA's charter, the agency must alert world leaders if itloses track of nuclear material under its inspection.   The Iraqi response came as the U.S. and its allies wererecruiting hundreds of experts, including many from U.S.weapons laboratories, to inspect Iraqi weapons facilities, aprocedure Iraq accepted under the cease-fire agreement. Theinspections are scheduled to get under way in another month.   Richard Wilson, a Harvard physicist who has visited theTuwaitha complex, says the facility covers a large area thatis surrounded by a raised earthen berm some 70 feet high.Inside are the ruins of the French reactor, bombed by theIsraelis in June 1981, and a smaller nuclear fuel testfacility. A quarter mile away, he says, is the Sovietreactor. U.S. officials said the Desert Storm bomber raidsdestroyed both the Soviet reactor and the nuclear fuel testfacility.   Mr. Wilson said there's a good chance the Iraqis removedthe fuel before the allied bombing raids began. &quot;I would havedone it, &quot; he said. &quot;The people who run that laboratory arevery intelligent people.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
