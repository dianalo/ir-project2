Gold prices edged up in U.S. trading after posting minor lossesoverseas.   Currency dealers sold dollars early in U.S. trading when ChaseManhattan Bank announced it was lowering its prime rate by a halfpoint to 10{ percent.   The reduction, effective immediately, was expected to cause otherbig banks to lower their primes, which are benchmark rates used toset interest charges on a variety of consumer and business loans.   As of late Monday, however, Chase was the only major bank toenact a rate cut. A regional Midwestern bank had trimmed its keyrate to 10{ percent on Friday.   The impact of the Chase move was muted because financial marketshave been anticipating interest rate declines for weeks. Lower U.S.interest rates hurt the dollar by reducing returns ondollar-denominated investments.   There is a perception in the markets that sluggish economicactivity eventually will lead to looser credit policies by bothcommercial banks and the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank.   For the time being, though, currency dealers apparently feelhappier holding dollars then letting them go, said Hugh Walsh, adealer in the New York office of Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank.   ``People are more concerned right now with getting caught shortdollars,'' said Walsh.   After the initial selling on Chase's announcement, the dollarbounced off its lowest levels as buying resumed, Walsh said.   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.37 yen to 139.28 yen. Later in Londonit was quoted at 138.95 yen. In New York the dollar finished at139.20 yen, unchanged from Friday's late level.   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound.
