Few physicians or physician groups advertise. The ads that do appear lack such crucial details as fees, office waiting time, experience or references.    Still, there are strategies that can demystify the process and help a lay person evaluate which doctor is best for a particular problem.    Doctors themselves agree that a person with a medical problem that isn't an emergency, such as an infection or recurring pain, first should see a so-called primary-care physician.    Until the past decade, that often meant a general practitioner, or GP. In 1969, however, the field of family medicine became a recognized specialty and a suitable replacement for the GP. Nowadays, doctors wishing certification as a family practitioner must complete a three-year residency, learning to diagnose and treat a wide range of ills as well as determine what kind of specialist may be needed for more complex problems.    A good family practitioner is someone who takes the time to delve into a patient's background -- from family medical history to insurance coverage -- and who knows a region's medical community intimately enough to make knowledgeable referrals to specialists. This doctor also must be willing to coordinate care among the specialists who treat his patients.    Doctors of internal medicine also can serve as good primary-care physicians, especially if they have had the training that qualifies them as a true generalist. With competition stiff among doctors in some cities these days, more internists trained in such subspecialties as cardiology are willing to act as primary-care doctors, eschewing the specialists' high fees for the chance to make it on volume.    In today's transient society, where neighborhoods are full of strangers, finding and then staying with a family doctor is increasingly difficult. Many people, especially young adults newly arrived in an area, are turning to a new service: a 24-hour walk-in clinic sometimes styled as an &quot;outpatient emergicenter&quot; and flippantly called a doc-in-a-box.    Easy access and sometimes lower fees make these clinics useful for less severe emergencies. They aren't very good, however, at life- or limb-threatening illnesses and injuries encountered in hospital emergency rooms. Also, doctors at these centers usually are supplementing their incomes, and staff turnover is high. Few patients will see the same physician twice.    A health maintenance organization, if available, is another solution: For a monthly premium, the HMO subscriber gets checkups and other basic care without additional charge.    Some HMOs are organized with primary-care doctors and specialists under one roof. A patient often will be seen by one of a small group of doctors for routine visits; the potential drawback here is that patients rarely choose the doctor they will see.    Other HMOs are organized as a loose network of doctors who work out of their own offices. These HMOs provide a greater choice of physicians -- patients pick their doctors from a list of member physicians -- and many independent doctors now join them as a way of marketing their services. It's a good idea, therefore, to ask a doctor if he or she belongs to an HMO because that form of insurance may reduce a patient's payments for doctor visits.    Some HMOs are being criticized now for encouraging doctors to hold down costs. The critics say this practice could result in inferior care. HMO advocates deny that watching costs reduces the quality of care; they add that if the organizations did scrimp on health services, patients would move on.    Other sources for doctors are the local medical society, which can provide a list of its members, and hospitals, which will suggest either a staff physician or one with privileges at their institution. Hospitals often have their own specialty clinics for treating such problems as allergies or even infertility. Many also sponsor primarycare outpatient clinics, though the hours are sometimes limited.    Hospital clinics may be staffed by doctors on salary, many of whom are in various stages of training required for accreditation as a specialist. Some hospitals give independent doctors free office space or discounts on rents in the institution in exchange for agreeing to admit their patients to the hospital. Thus, a hospital may have a vested interest in whom its staff recommends.    Clinics situated inside a hospital have a possible drawback: Hospitals, despite their best efforts, are home for all sorts of bacteria, putting patients with low resistance at risk.    Yet another source of information is a nearby medical school, which usually will provide names of faculty members who have private practices, or doctors the faculty respects. Don't expect the school to rate or critique local physicians, though.    A word about fees and billing methods: Medicare and private insurance companies are trying to reduce payments to doctors by negotiating lower fees, shortening hospital stays, and paying only 80% of a doctor's charges. Some doctors, in turn, are raising their fees, hoping that the patient will pay for what the insurance carrier won't.    Patients can fight back by insisting that doctors accept limited insurance reimbursement as full payment; in areas where there's a doctor glut, many physicians already hold their charges to insurers' limits of reimbursement.    ---        'OK, Doc, if you were sick, where would you go?'   Deans of nine leading medical schools each were asked tolist the five best hospitals in the coutry.
