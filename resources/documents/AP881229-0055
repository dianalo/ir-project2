Ali Mousavi of the private Nabovvat Foundation was also orderedby the court Wednesday to pay $17.8 million to 17 creditors,according to Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitoredin Nicosia.   Tehran's First Criminal Court also convicted him of an``illegitimate sexual act'' with a woman identified only as Azar B,the agency reported. The couple was sentenced to 74 lashes each bythe judge, a middle-ranking clergyman identified as HojatoleslamJalal Mousavi.   IRNA did not say if the judge was related to the defendant.   Iran's Supreme Judicial Council, headed by Ayatollah AbdulkarimMusavi Ardebili, must ratify the sentence.   The crackdown on corruption, which was rampant during the 8-yearwar against Iraq, comes as the government moves to loosen social,political and economic restrictions after the hardship and sacrificeof the war years.   It also is aimed partly at luring home tens of thousands ofeducated exiles whom the Tehran hierarchy wants to help rebuild thecountry.   Ardebili has declared repeatedly that lawlessness and theexcesses of revolutionary police and the Islamic RevolutionaryGuards Corps are among main obstacles preventing many of theestimated 2 million emigres from returning.   Iran's fundamentalist leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, lastmonth called for a campaign ``to rid the people of leech-likeelements affiliated to the government and the bazaar ... to endrip-offs and hoarding in government and private enterprises.''   The agency report did not say how Ali Mousavi, a former teacher,made his millions.   It said he set up his supposedly non-profit foundations severalyears ago with capital of $147,000 and advertised their aim ofproviding no-interest loans and other services to ``the families ofthe martyrs.''   ``Soon Mousavi was able not only to provide 250 million rials($3.6 million) in loans, but to invest heavily in trade and variousbusinesses worth more than 2 billion rials ($29.36 million),'' IRNAnoted.   It said Mousavi's trial, which began Oct. 8, was ``a test casefor a number of other cases involving savings and loan organizationsthat mushroomed after the Islamic revolution.''   IRNA quoted the judge as saying: ``A lot of people thought thathigh-ranking officials had their hands stuck in the NabovvatFoundation case.   ``But the court followed up the issue with utmost patience,precision and fairness and, praise be to God, did not come up withanything.''   But he stressed: ``We are bound by Islam and the Islamic Republic... to bring any individual on key positions, who God forbid isinvolved in such issues, into this courtroom and deal with him.''   Mousavi's conviction followed that of Toraj Mansur, formermanaging director of state-run Saipa Co., which manufactures Renaultsedans. He was jailed for eight years and fined $236 million forembezzling $115 million.   The official media has not disclosed how effective theanti-corruption campaign has been. But the Tehran daily Ettelatnoted in a recent editorial: ``Cases like Saipa are not rare.   ``If the government does not translate into action its will topurge ... renovation will remain nothing but an ideal.''   Travelers from Tehran, including Iranian businessmen, havereported scores of cases in which Revolutionary Guards and officialsof police revolutionary committees have demanded protection money,or confiscated goods then demanded money for their return.   The corruption crackdown coincides with new moves to stamp outdrug smuggling and abuse, widespread in Iran, and to curbprofiteering.</TEXT></DOC>
