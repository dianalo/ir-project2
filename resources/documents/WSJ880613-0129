However, he erroneously implies that these differences between groups can refute claims about &quot;growing inequality.&quot;    A careful examination of the data for families with very similar demographic attributes documents that inequality has been increasing within most groups since the early 1970s. For example, the Congressional Budget Office reports substantial increases in inequality for married couples with children after adjustments for inflation, the age of the father and changes in family size. Between 1973 and 1986, mean income for the bottom 20% of families where the father was 25 to 34 years old declined by 11.3%; it rose by 10.9% for the top 20%. For families where the father was 35 to 54, the mean for families at the bottom increased by 10%, while it increased by 25.2% for those at the top.    Mr. Novak correctly cautions us that statistics can be misinterpreted. But we should not lose sight of the fact that economic hardship has increased despite the ongoing recovery. In 1985, the mean per-capita money income of families with children was $7,273. The bottom fifth of children lived in families with a per-capita income of only $1,433. Their situation has worsened absolutely but especially relative to the children of the wealthy: Between 1967 and 1985, the ratio of per-capita income for the top fifth to the bottom fifth of children increased from 7.4 to 11.2.    The chances of children of lower-income families for fully developing their potential and becoming productive citizens are diminished by such a low level of living no matter how one views the &quot;justice&quot; of their parents' position in the income distribution.
