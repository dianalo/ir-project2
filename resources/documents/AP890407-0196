Federico Mayor, director-general of the U.N. Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organization, noted the third anniversaryon April 17 of the kidnapping of British television journalist JohnMcCarthy, 32.   Mayor said in a statement that the British journalist ``has nowpassed three years of his life deprived of his freedom, denied theright to exercise his profession and robbed of the joys of home andfamily.   ``Alas, he is not alone. Others are in the same intolerablesituation in the Middle East, including another journalist, TerryAnderson.''   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent of The AssociatedPress, began his fifth year in captivity in Lebanon three weeksago. He was abducted March 16, 1985, and is the longest-held amongthe 15 foreign hostages, who include nine Americans.   A group of British, French and other journalists are organizinga ceremony at UNESCO April 17 to mark McCarthy's captivity.   Mayor said UNESCO is deeply concerned with the fate of thehostages because one of its responsibilities in advancingindividual human rights is to promote the free exchange of ideas.   Officials say different factions hold the hostages, but they allare under the umbrella group Hezbollah, over which Iran is believedto exercise control. Last week Mayor sent an envoy to talk with theIranian government.   Mayor also said he was concerned about the people of Lebanonbecause April 13 marks the 14th anniversary of the civil war inthat eastern Mediterranean country. For weeks now, Moslem andChristian forces have been engaged in heavy artillery battles inand around Beirut.   ``I appeal to all governments concerned and to the internationalcommunity at large to do everthing within their power to end thelong suffering and hardship of this afflicted people,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
