In evaluating this reserve,the IPR-R1 research nuclear reactor has given a significant contribution.This reactor has been in operation since 1960 for research, technology,radionuclide production and training purposes. The available irradiationfacilities allow the use of neutron-activation to determine uranium contents.Up to now, a total of 330,000 mineral sample analyses were carried out.</TEXT></DOC>
