A spokesman for the Xerox unit, Furman Selz Mager Dietz andamp; Birney Inc., declined to comment. Officials at PPN couldn't be reached for comment.    Specialists have exclusive franchises to make markets on the floor of the Big Board in their assigned stocks. They are supposed to attempt to maintain orderly markets by buying shares when there are too few buyers and selling when the market lacks sellers.    Industry officials said that PPN's financial position had been weakened by the October market crash, making the firm receptive to an acquisition. Still, the firm is among the more highly respected of the exchange's specialist units. </TEXT></DOC>
