It is found that internalstresses have a direct effect on the short-term strength of the composite,whose value is always less than the rule-of-mixtures value at test temperaturesbelow 600 C. It is thought, however, that the presence of thermal stressesis not the factor responsible for composite fracture under cyclic loading.10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
