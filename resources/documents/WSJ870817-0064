Daniel G. Dunstan, secretary-treasurer, said that despite a first-quarter loss, he's &quot;very comfortable&quot; with analysts' estimates that the maker and distributor of golf course and lawn care products and equipment will earn 70 cents a share in the current fiscal year, which ends Nov. 30.    &quot;We expect a tremendous fourth quarter, potentially the best in our history,&quot; Mr. Dunstan said in an interview.    James I. Fitzgibbon, chairman and chief executive officer, said he expects sales to grow at an average of 30% annually for the next five years. Fiscal 1986 sales were $69.3 million, up from $53.3 million the year before.    Lesco has a 36-truck fleet of &quot;stores on wheels&quot; that each average about $800,000 annually in sales of golf course and lawn care products. In the next fiscal year, the company plans to add three to five trucks, Mr. Fitzgibbon said. Making 10 to 12 sales stops daily, the trucks serve about a quarter of the country's 13,000 golf courses, officials said.    In the fiscal 1987 second quarter, the company added eight service center stores, bringing to 21 the number of stores that supply landscapers and lawn maintenance professionals. By the end of the current fiscal year Lesco plans to have about 30 stores, each with about 3,000 square feet of space. </TEXT></DOC>
