The influence of constraint is also investigated, bothlocally as defined by the ratios of mean (hydrostatic) stress and maximumprincipal stress to von Mises stress, and globally as defined by thefactor m = J/({sigma}sub(Y) ''centre dot'' CTOD). Results obtained indicatethat stress fields in a varying constraint environment (i.e. varyingboth spatially and with extent of plastic deformation) are not uniquelycharacterized by J and require additional information on the amount ofconstraint. Fracture predictions based on maximum principal stress aheadof the crack tip exhibit far less scatter than those based on J, butfurther investigations are required on the geometry (in)dependence ofthis local parameter.</TEXT></DOC>
