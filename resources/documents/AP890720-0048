(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A labor dispute that began 3{ months ago asa small walkout at one company has mushroomed into a battle betweenthe United Mine Workers and the coal industry, and turnedsouthwestern Virginia's mountains into a tinderbox of violence.   The strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc. spread for a timethrough wildcat strikes to every coal-producing state in the Eastand led to shooting, rock throwing and thousands of arrests.   U.S. District Judge Glenn Williams has imposed more than $4million in fines on the union for violating an order against civildisobedience by blocking mine entrances and coal-hauling roads.   Today the two sides appear as far apart as ever, although a judgehas persuaded them to resume talks and most of the wildcat strikeshave subsided.   Pittston Coal has headquarters in Lebanon, Va., and 30 coaloperations _ including 20 mines _ in three states. It is asubsidiary of the Greenwich, Conn.-based Pittston Co.   The strike initially involved 1,700 UMW members in Virginia andWest Virginia. In June, 200 Kentucky miners joined the walkout.   All had been working for 14 months without a contract afterPittston refused to sign a national agreement reached last year withthe Bituminous Coal Operators Association.   Pittston President Michael Odom said the association agreementthreatened his company's economic stability. He sought concessions _in work rules and benefits rather than wages _ that he claimed wouldsave the company $5 or more in labor costs per ton of coal.   UMW President Richard Trumka, fearing that one successful holdoutwould lead to other companies to reject the national contract,accused Pittston of trying to break the union.   Pittston has hired replacement workers but saw production cut toa third of normal levels during the first two months of the strike.   The strike began spreading June 12, after federally mediatednegotiations broke down and Williams imposed fines and temporarilyjailed three union leaders in an effort to stop disruptions of coaltraffic.   Wildcat sympathy walkouts eventually involved as many as 46,000miners in 10 Eastern states. Most workers returned to their jobsthis week, heeding union orders, but thousands of miners remainedoff the job in West Virginia.   Pay is not a big issue in the Pittston dispute. Miners will earna maximum $16.77 an hour over three years under terms the companyput into effect on its own June 10.   A major issue that sparked harsh words at Wednesday's resumptionof talks concerns health and retirement benefits for miners.   Pittston wants to pull out of a national retirement fund andreplace it with a plan only for its 560 retirees covered by theplan. Trumka says that would jeopardize medical benefits for 6,000pensioners, Pittston's share of the 130,000 pensioners covered bythe national fund.   Pittston also wants the right to require overtime and Sundaywork. The union further accuses Pittston of threatening job securityby seeking permission to hire outside contractors to perform jobsthat have been handled by UMW members.   The company contends it needs a seven-day work week and otherflexibility to meet competition from non-union and foreign coalproducers. Pittston is the nation's 15th largest coal producer butits largest exporter.   Job security is a touchy issue because of the increasingmechanization of mining that has seen UMW membership drop to 85,000from 144,000 in 1980 and a peak of 400,000 during World War II.Union miners produce only a little more than a third of the nation'scoal, down from 70 percent in 1970. The UMW represents about 45percent of U.S. coal miners.   Although the judge succeeded in getting Trumka and Odom to resumetalks Wednesday, the agreement to resume negotiations showed how farapart, and bitterly divided, the two sides remain.   Pittston was allowed to continue claiming that talks are at animpasse, which keeps its self-imposed contract terms in effect. Theunion was allowed to preserve its claim that Pittston failed tobargain in good faith, holding open the possibility that strikerswill get their jobs back once the dispute ends.   The dispute marks the second time in as many BCOA contracts thatthe union has fought a coal company to sign a labor agreement.   In December 1985, the UMW ended a 15-month strike against theA.T. Massey Coal Co. that started when the Richmond-based Masseyleft to its subsidiaries whether to sign the pact. The UMW insistedthat Massey, as the parent, sign for its holdings.   At its peak, the walkout involved 2,000 union miners in Kentuckyand Virginia. Most Massey subsidiaries eventually reached a contractwith the union after obtaining limited concessions.</TEXT></DOC>
