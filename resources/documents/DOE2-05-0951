Inthe alternative plan it is assumed that demand for material goods willtend to saturate within 15 to 20 years. This is based on surveys of people'spreference in Denmark to-day. Technical possibilities for energy savingsand their costs are investigated. The alternative plan could within 20years lead to a consumption of primary energy of less than half the amountresulting from the offical plan, and at a lower total cost. Furthermore,the consumption would by then be declining in the alternative plan, contraryto the growing demand in the government's plan. The supply system inthe alternative energy plan is based to a high degree on local, renewableenergy sources. This will imply a radical change of the present supplysystem in Denmark. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the alternativesupply system a regional project is being implemented on the island ofBornholm. This project is described in the paper. 17 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
