The formation of the new party, to be known as the DemocraticParty, is an attempt to broaden the political base of whiteliberals, who are widely seen as being in a state of disarray.   The party will be launched formally in Johannesburg on April 8,but ``concerted planning and action begin today,'' the organizationsaid Saturday after a meeting.   The Democratic Party will have three leaders who presently areserving as the heads of the merging parties.   They are Zac de Beer of the Progressive Federal Party, WynandMalan of the National Democratic Movement, and Denis Worrall of theIndependent Party.   The Progressive Federal Party currently has 17 of the 178 seatsin the white chamber of Parliament, while the National DemocraticMovement has three and the Independent Party none.   The National Party, which has ruled South Africa 40 years,maintains firm control of the white chamber with 133 seats, whilethe extreme-right Conservative Party is the official opposition with24 seats. A small independent party holds the 178th seat.   South Africa's Parliament has separate houses for whites, Asiansand people of mixed-race, but not for the majority 26 million blacks.   The liberal white parties draw their support almost exclusivelyfrom the major urban areas such as Johannesburg, Cape Town andDurban, but they have been losing some support in recent years.   The three merging parties all oppose apartheid and theirplatforms are largely similar.   They said they hope to attract whites who traditionally vote forthe National Party but who have become disillusioned by itsstart-and-stop race reform.   ``Our immediate objectives are the consolidation of existingmembership, the recruitment of those many South Africans ... who arelooking for a new political home, and the achievement of support andcredibility across the political spectrum,'' the Democratic Partysaid Saturday.   In 1987, Malan resigned from the National Party to form theNational Democratic Movement and Worrall quit as South Africa'sambassador to Britain to form the Independent Party. Both men citeddisappointment with the government's slow pace of reform.   The government must call an election before March 1990, and mostobservers believe it will be scheduled sometime this year.   In neighboring Zimbabwe, a group of white South African lawyersand black officials of the African National Congress ended a meetingSaturday with a call for the formation of a multiparty democracy inSouth Africa.   A communique released jointly by 30 South Africa-based attorneysand law academics and about 15 exiled ANC officials said a consensuswas reached that there is a need to create conditions so SouthAfrica's whites and blacks have equal rights.   It was the first meeting between white law academics and leadersof the ANC, the largest guerrilla organization fighting the SouthAfrican government.</TEXT></DOC>
