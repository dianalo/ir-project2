No pick up.</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A research satellite launched last week totest elements of the proposed ``Star Wars'' anti-missile shieldfailed in a secondary tracking excercise when an optical sensorgave false data to two on-board computers, an Air Force officialsaid Friday.   Air Force Col. John Otten, assistant director of the StrategicDefense Initiative's kinetic energy office, said an optical sensoron Delta 181, a satellite used to test ``Star Wars'' sensors andtrackers, gave flawed data when it tried to track target objectsthat were beyond its range.   Otten said the sensor data went into the computers, causing themto respond inappropriately. He said the flaw was detected within anhour and the computers were told to ignore the data. This correctedthe problem.   Some of the test data on the system was lost because of theproblem, but Otten said the loss was minor because the trackingexercise was a secondary objective. ``In the fundamental mission wesuceeded,'' he said.   Delta 181 was launched Feb. 8 from the Kennedy Space Center andspent 12 hours conducting a series of tests to gather data neededto refine the SDI, or ``Star Wars,'' anti-missile system.   Program manager Andy Green last week called the flight ``a verysuccessful mission.''   However, Aviation Week and Space Technology, in a story preparedfor Monday publication, said the satellite was unable to complete``battle management fire control computations.''   The magazine blamed the problem on the computers, but Otten saidthe flaw actually was caused by the optical sensor attempting tolock onto an object beyond its range.   Sensors on the satellite were used to track 14 sub-satellitetargets released in two groups from the Delta.   Otten said the problem developed when the optical sensor locatedan object, looked away, and then tried to relocate the originalobject. By then, the target had moved beyond the range of thesensor.   The tracking test using the optical sensor was halted when thefuel budgeted for that exercise became exhausted, Otten said.   He said an infrared sensor also failed to function properly, butinfrared data was collected by a back-up system.   Otten said only about three percent of the data collected duringthe 12-hour mission of Delta 181 has been examined.</TEXT></DOC>
