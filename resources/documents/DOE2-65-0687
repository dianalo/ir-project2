Therefore, FBC is a kind of combustion that protects theenvironment. But as tests show, if the limestone is thrown simply intothe bed, it will not react fully with SO/sub 2/, and calcium cannot befully utilized, and that makes this simple method not economical in industrialapplication. Hua-yi sulfur dioxide sorbent is highly effective for sulfurremoval. In this paper the method of experimental study of it is introduced.The influences of sorbent diameter and sulfur dioxide concentration andthe time for sulphur removal on calcium utilization are investigatedrespectively. The thermal effects of sorbent are also analyzed. Accordingly,some formulas of calculation are proposed.</TEXT></DOC>
