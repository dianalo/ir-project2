The Senate would take an immediate 9.7 percentboost.   Except for the Senate, a 7.9 percent increase would be given byJan. 1 as a catch-up for two years without a cost-of-livingadjustment, or COLA. On Jan. 1, 1991, the same officials wouldreceive a 25 percent pay increase, on top of whatevergovernment-wide COLA takes effect at that time.   Assuming no COLA in 1991, those salaries would go to $120,800.Assuming a COLA of about 3 percent, pay would be about $124,400 _39 percent above the current $89,500.   After that, annual pay adjustments of up to 5 percent would beautomatic, based on the government's index of private-sector wagesand salaries.</TEXT><TEXT>   For the Senate, the 9.7 percent increase would be a raise ofabout $8,700.</TEXT><BYLINE>OUTSIDE INCOME</BYLINE><TEXT>   House members, officers and employees, federal judges andgovernment executives would be barred from accepting honoraria, orspeaking fees, beginning in 1991. For House members, current ruleslimit such fees to 30 percent of salary. For senators, it's 40percent.   Once the ban takes effect, lawmakers could still steer speechpayments directly to charity, but they could not exceed $2,000.   Senators would keep on collecting honoraria, but reduce thelimit dollar for dollar as their pay rises.   Income earned outside of Congress by lawmakers and top staffwould be limited to 15 percent of congressional salary beginning in1991. They could not receive directors' fees, legal fees or otherincome for professional services. Book royalties would be exempt,but must be from established publishers and at ``usual andcustomary'' rates.   Both the limit on outside income and the honoraria ban would belifted if the 1991 pay raise is repealed.</TEXT><BYLINE>GIFTS AND TRAVEL</BYLINE><TEXT>   The two chambers would have new rules, slightly different fromeach other, on accepting gifts.   In the House, members and staff could not receive gifts from anyperson, outside of family, totaling more than $200 a year beginningJan. 1. Most meals and gifts under $75 would not be counted in thetotal. Currently, members are barred from receiving more than $100a year in gifts from anyone with a ``direct interest inlegislation.'' Privately paid speaking trips would be limited tofour days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel.   The Senate would have a $300 gift limit, except for family, andwould limit travel to three days domestic and seven for foreigntrips.</TEXT><BYLINE>ETHICS COMMITTEE</BYLINE><TEXT>   The bipartisan House panel would be expanded from 12 to 14members and would separate its investigative and trial functions.If a House member is being investigated, the panel would divideinto two groups. One would serve in effect as a grand jury and theother as the trial jury.</TEXT><BYLINE>EXCESS CAMPAIGN FUNDS</BYLINE><TEXT>   House members who were in office in 1980 and now are allowed tokeep leftover campaign contributions when they retire would seethat privilege abolished in 1993.</TEXT><BYLINE>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE</BYLINE><TEXT>   Both chambers would require more detailed reporting of theirassets, liabilities, income, and the gifts and travel they accept.The members who now report their assets and liabilities in generalranges would have to be more specific, especially when they areworth more than $250,000.</TEXT><BYLINE>REVOLVING DOOR</BYLINE><TEXT>   The Senate version contains an entire section, not in the Housebill, on post-employment lobbying by government employees.   It would bar members of Congress from lobbying anywhere in thelegislative branch for one year after they leave office. Cabinetsecretaries and very top White House aides could not lobby for ayear any other top executive branch official.   Federal employees who gain confidential information learned froma trade or treaty negotiation could not turn around and representprivate interests on that matter for one year.</TEXT></DOC>
