Police clashedwith protesters in two cities.   The leaders of the three main opposition parties also accusedPresident Roh Tae-woo's government of fomenting unrest with harshcrackdowns on opponents and by failing to carry out promiseddemocratic reforms.   Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil, in a statementaimed at radical students and workers, said: ``We warn against anexpansion of leftist forces trying to overthrow our democraticsystem through violent revolution.''   About 5,000 striking workers clashed with riot police for athird day in Changwon, about 180 miles south of Seoul.   Workers hurled firebombs and rocks at police and set fire todrums of oil to hold back charging troopers.   In another clash, about 600 radical students shouting ``Downwith Roh Tae-woo!'' hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police atHankook University in Seoul. Police used multiple tear gaslaunchers to combat the students.   Police said there were injuries in both cities, but they gave nodetails.   The government issued a warning today against a major rally thatradical workers and students planned Monday to mark the May Dayholiday. The government said police would block the Seoul rally.   Organizers vowed to defy the warning and said they expected100,000 people to attend.   In another development, student leaders announced plans for amarch Friday to the North Korean border for talks with communiststudents on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula. Police issuedorders banning the march and a planned rally Sunday in Seoul bylabor groups.   The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's maindissident alliance, said the police actions were an ``illegal abuseof power'' and vowed to go ahead with demonstrations.   The students and dissidents lack popular support because oftheir violence and extreme views and are not seen as a seriousthreat to the government. But government leaders say a wave ofstrikes for better pay are damaging the economy and could lead toserious political unrest.   The Trade and Industry Ministry said today that strikes thisyear had so far cost about $3.5 billion in lost production,including nearly $900 million in exports.   Two of the nation's three automakers, Hyundai and Kia, havevirtually halted production because of strikes at companies makingcomponents, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.   The opposition leaders, known as the three Kims, said they wouldtry to form a new opposition alliance and demanded the governmentkeep its promise to punish former officials of the authoritarianregime of former President Chun Doo-hwan.   Chun went into rural exile last November after apologizing tothe nation for corruption and rights abuses under his rule, butopposition parties are demanding top Chun lieutenants also beprosecuted for wrongdoings.   The three Kims said Roh must keep an election promise to hold areferendum. Roh called off such a vote in March, saying it woulddivide the nation.   The three opposition leaders have formed alliances in the past,but they are deeply divided and have often clashed. The lastopposition alliance collapsed earlier this year in a dispute overwhether the government should hold Roh's promised referendum.   Roh, a former general, won elections in December 1987 after thethree Kims all ran and split the opposition vote. Roh succeeded hisformer ally, Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
