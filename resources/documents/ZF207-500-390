Hassell Road, Suite 400 Hoffman Estates, IL 60195 (312) 882-0111andM;DESCRIPTION: Full-featured word processing software with page-layoutcapabilityandM;TEST CONFIGURATION: Mass-11 version 8.0 installed on a MicroVAX II runningunder VMS version 4.7.andM;PRICE AS TESTED: $5,750andM;PROS: * Has new, streamlined menu system * Supports Post Script * Allowsusers to integrated graphics, spreadsheets and external list records throughoptional add-on products * Offers three command keypad configurations * Haswide range of formatting features * Includes spelling checker and thesaurusandM;CONS: * Runs only under VMS and MS-DOSandM;READER SERVICE: Fill in No.andP;  400 on Reader Service CardandM;Scrambling to keep to with the demand for in-house publishing capabilities,many of the leading word processing vendors are introducing sophisticiatedcopy-fitting tools, links to graphics and spreadsheet packages, and PCportability to their products.andP;  But those enhancements add complexity, makinga word processor more difficult to use.andM;Microsystems Engineering Corp. (MEC) has addressed this issue by introducing,in version 8.0, a streamlined menu system for its Mass-11 word processor thatmakes Mass-11's many features more accessible.andP;  MEC has also added theability to integrate graphics with text, expanding Mass-11's existing desktoppublishing features such as support for PostScript fonts and proportionalspacing.andM;To help users improve the quality of their writing as well as itspresentation, MEC has added a thesaurus to the spelling checker that Mass-11already had.andM;We tested Mass-11 version 8.0 on a MicroVAX II running under VMS version 4.7.andO;Mass-11 is also available in an MS-DOS version for IBM PCs and compatibles.andO;To date, these are the only hardware platforms on which Mass-11 can run.andM;NEW FEATURES, NEW FEELandM;Since we reviewed version 6-C of Mass-11 (See &quot;VAX WP with All the Extras,&quot;Digital Review, May 4, 1987, page 37), much of the product's &quot;look and feel&quot;has changed, and several features have been added.andM;The first thing that veteran Mass-11 users will notice is that all of themenus have been rewritten.andP;  Users are greeted with a new main menu when theyfirst start up the program.andM;Besides giving access to the basic Word Processing Menu, this main menuallows users to select list processing, graphics, a mail utility, a databasemanager, fax processing, a calendar and a spreadsheet--all available from MECas add-on products.andP;  Instead of selecting from a list of single numbers andletters, users now make their selections from a list of two-charactermnemonic choices (Fig.andP;  1).andM;The Word Processing Menu now includes more of the features that users accessmost frequently.andP;  This menu serves as the central road map to Mass-11's wordprocessing features and contains several submenus.andP;  The bottom of each screenis reserved for Mass-11's messages and prompts to users.andM;Mass-11's on-line help utility can be used to explore the product's features.andO;When a user presses andless;PF1andgt; ?, several pages of topics are displayed.andP;  Userscan type the name of a specific topic or they can use arrow keys to move thecursor to its name.andP;  From here, pressing andless;Returnandgt; brings up the help text onthat topic.andP;  Help is available both from within a document and from the menulevel.andM;Users familiar with previous versions of Mass-11 will have to learn some newterminology.andP;  The old versions' &quot;directories&quot; for storing documents are nowcalled &quot;folder&quot;--a wise change that should eliminate confusion with VMSdirectories.andP;  Users select a folder by typing SF or FOL at the wordprocessing menu and entering its name.andP;  They can list all of their existingfolders by pressing andless;PF1andgt; L.andM;Users can get an index of all documents in a folder by typing DI at any menuor by pressing andless;PF1andgt; L at any of Mass-11's &quot;Document Name:&quot; prompts.andP;  Theindex displays a line for each document, giving its Mass-11 name, theinitials of the user who created it, an S or a W for standard or wide format,the language in which the document was written, the date it was created, thedate and time it was last modified, the number of lines in the document andits file extension and version number.andM;In Mass-11 version 8.0, users create macros to store and recall frequentlyrepeated operations.andP;  These were called user-defined keys (UDKs) in earlierversions.andP;  Users can define as many as 32,000 macros, each able to store anunlimited number of keystrokes.andP;  UDKs created with previous versions ofMass-11 must be converted to the new format to be used in version 8.0.andM;To create a macro, users enter a utility called the Macro Editor.andP;  Thisutility's menu allows users to create, edit, delete, rename, copy and printmacros or convert old UDKs to macros.andP;  Choosing CR or ED calls up an editor.andO;Users can then type in the macro's commands, along with special keywords thatcan direct the macro to perform such functions as, for example, pausing toaccept input from a user.andM;To invoke a macro, users press andless;PF1andgt; and then whatever number they haveassigned that macro.andP;  If the macro has been given an alphabetic name, userspress andless;PF1andgt; U and then type 1 at the prompt.andP;  Mass-11 will prompt for themacro's name and then execute it.andM;Many of Mass-11's editing commands are tied to standard VT numeric-keypadkeys.andP;  Mass-11 offers three keypad configurations: one of its own design andtwo more that resemble the WPS and EDT keypad configurations.andM;Frequently used text can be stored in documents called glossaries so it canbe retrieved quickly with only a few keystrokes.andP;  Each entry in a glossary isdistinguished by a keyword as long as 25 characters, which is stored betweenangle bracket (andless;andgt;) preceding the entry's text.andP;  To insert text into adocument from a glossary, users press andless;PF1andgt; G.andP;  Mass-11 prompts for theglossary file name, then the keyword, and afterwards inserts the requestedtext in the document.andM;A user's work is saved after every 100 keystrokes by Mass-11's automaticjournaling feature.andP;  The process is transparent to users and can preventanguish and frustration should the system crash unexpectedly after a user hasspent hours typing a document.andM;RULERS ARE KINGandM;Page formatting in Mass-11 is controlled by rulers.andP;  Version 8.0 includesseveral additions and enhancements to Mass-11's formatting features.andM;Using the rulers, users can now specify spacing in the default 10-pitchincrement, in 12-point characters or in tenths of inches or centimeters.andO;Margins can be set ragged right or right justified.andP;  The left margin can bemoved in from the edge of a document, and the right margin can be temporarilymoved in with a right margin tab.andM;Several kinds of tabs are available, including regular, paragraph wrap,hanging indentation, right justified, decimal aligned and character aligned.andO;Mass-11 also offers leading character tabs that insert dots, dashes orunderscores into the documents before the tab.andM;Users can replace identical rulers wherever they appear in a document byusing andless;PF1andgt; R, the same command used to replace strings.andM;Much of Mass-11's powerful document formatting is accomplished using embeddedcommands.andP;  These commands appear between angle brackets (andless;andgt;) to distinguishthem from text that should be printed.andP;  Users can get a list of embeddedcommands by typing an empty pair of angle brackets and pressing andless;PF1andgt; andless;.andO;Embedded commands control text integration (included documents, ASCII filesand graphics), line drawings (boxes and circles), header and footer text,non-printing comments, and print formatting (font, point size and pitch).andM;Mass-11's desktop publishing capabilities include support for multiplePostScript fonts within the same document.andP;  Changing fonts is as simple asincluding an embedded command with the appropriate font number in the text ofthe document.andP;  (Font numbers are usually established by the system manager.)andO;For a list of available fonts, users can enter the embedded command without afont number (andless;FO=andgt;) and press andless;PF1andgt; andless; to display a menu of available fonts.andO;The user simply moves the cursor to the desired font and presses andless;Returnandgt;.andM;Version 8.0 includes a new vertical ruler capability that allows users tochange the line spacing within a document, a feature known in the publishingtrade as &quot;leading&quot; (rhymes with bedding), and to change the spacing betweenparagraphs.andP;  Version 8.0 does not offer kerning, the ability to control thespacing between letters.andP;  A company representative said the word processor'sproportionally spaced fonts improve the look of the copy, diminishing theneed for kerning.andM;Using a vertical ruler, users can also specify the position of the header andfooter lines and the position of the first text line, as well as the depth ofthe text on the page--settings that can also be established using thePage/Document Parameters option on the Defaults Menu.andP;  Users can specifythese measurements in either inches or centimeters.andM;Vertical rulers are inserted in documents by using embedded commands.andP;  Onlyone vertical ruler can be used per page.andP;  Frequently used vertical rulers andtheir associated text, such as templates for section-divider pages, can bekept in glossary documents for quick and easy use.andM;Users can control text positioning on a page more precisely using embedded XYcommands (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  Each XY command places the text that appears after it ateither an absolute position on the page (measured in inches or centimeters)or at a position measured relative to the document's top-left margin.andM;Users can further tailor the format of their output using hyphenation.andO;Mass-11 will insert hyphens to break a word if moving the entire word to thenext line would leave five or more blank spaces at the end of the line.andP;  Thisfive-character &quot;hot zone&quot; can be increased or reduced by placing an &quot;H&quot; inthe document's ruler, marking the beginning of the hot zone.andM;Mass-11's printing capabilities have also been enhanced.andP;  Using the Hot Printfeature, users no longer have to save documents before printing them.andO;Version 8.0 also includes a Hot Preview feature that allows users to see whatdocuments will look like when printed while they are still editing thedocument.andP;  Users can inspect documents to check the appearance of linelengths and page breaks, for example.andP;  This capability can save time andpaper.andP;  Users access the Hot Pring feature by pressing andless;PF1andgt; * P and the HotPreview feature by pressing andless;PF1andgt; * V.andM;Mass-11 offers a full range of list-processing capabilities.andP;  Users can sortand select from list documents that include as many as 1,000 records.andM;For longer lists with as many as 65,000 records, the software now has acompanion product called Superlist.andP;  Another companion product, Mass-11Manager, lets users store list records in an external database.andP;  Neither ofthese add-on products was included in the version of Mass-11 that we tested.andM;All of MEC's list-processing products allow users to merge list informationinto a form document, applying sort and selection criteria to producecustomized versions of documents.andM;CREATIVE WRITINGandM;Like previous versions of Mass-11, version 8.0 can print headers, footers,footnotes and endnotes.andP;  It can highlight text with bold print, underlining,overstriking and change bars--vertical lines in the document's margins thatmark groups of text lines.andP;  Users can generate indexes and tables ofcontents.andP;  Several kinds of numbering schemes are available, includingnumbering of pages, paragraphs and outlines.andP;  Mass-11 also includes a modefor editing scientific equations, and it supports printing of specialcharacters from the alternate character sets contained in some printers.andM;Mass-11's red-lining feature allows users to track changes in a document(Fig.andP;  3).andP;  This capability can be particularly handy when more than oneperson is working on a document.andP;  Pressing andless;PF3andgt; R puts users in red-liningmode.andP;  Thereafter, all text added to a document is highlighted in bold type,and text deleted from the document is highlighted in underlined reverse-videomode rather than being removed altogether.andM;A user can print a red-lined document showing the inserted and deleted text.andO;Red-lined deletions can be restored at any time.andP;  When the user is satisfiedwith the document, the red-lining can be cleared, making the changespermanent.andM;Mass-11's spelling checker is invoked by pressing andless;PF1andgt; * S.andP;  It compareseach word in the document to its own dictionary as well as to the user'sprivate dictionary.andP;  If no match is found for a given word in eitherdictionary, the spelling checker will highlight it and prompt the user foraction.andM;At this point the user can choose from four options: Accept, Insert, Lookupor Retype.andP;  Accept leaves the word unchanged; Insert leaves it unchanged andadds it to the user's private dictionary as a valid spelling; Lookup displaysa list of valid words that are similar to the word in question, which theuser can choose among; and Retype lets the user type in a new spelling.andM;Mass-11's thesaurus is invoked by pressing andless;PF1andgt; * T while the cursor restson a word.andP;  The thesaurus displays a list of several possible meanings of theword.andP;  The user presses andless;Returnandgt; to choose the meaning that is closest to thesense of the word as it is used in the document.andP;  The thesaurus then displaysa list of words that are synonymous with the original word.andP;  The user canselect one of those words to replace the word in the document by moving thecursor to it and pressing andless;Returnandgt;, or opt not to change the original word bypressing andless;FP4andgt;.andM;FANCY FONTSandM;Under Mass-11 version 8.0, there are more ways to print a document than everbefore.andP;  As in earlier versions, every print command has an analogous previewcommand.andM;From the Word Processing Menu, users can choose Batch Print, which promptsthe users for a specific queue to which a document should be sent, or QuickPrint, which prints the document using the default print queue.andP;  There's alsoa Preview/Print option that calls up a menu of additional printing options.andO;If users choose PR from this menu, they can alter any of a document's defaultprinting parameters.andM;A user can also alter these parameters at any time via the page/printparameter screens, accessed by pressing andless;PF1andgt; M while working in a document.andO;Values can be set to control pagination (manual or automatic); the locationof headers, footers and main text; margins; red-lining; change bars; numberof copies; and printer queues.andM;For users who like to brighten up their documents with graphics and tables,Mass-11 now provides live links to PostScript files (Fig.andP;  4).andP;  Graphics tobe included in a document are stored in a separate file.andP;  Figures inEncapsulated PostScript (EPS) or Mass-11 Draw formats can be includeddirectly.andP;  (Draw is a graphics package for users of the PC version ofMass-11.)andM;Files in other graphics formats--such as Macintosh PICT, HP-GL, Tektronix4010 or 4014, Molecular Design Ltd. (MDL) and Lotus PIC--must be processedthrough the Mass-11 Graphics Processor, a separate product.andM;At print time, Mass-11 merges the graphics file with the document's text andcreates an image on a PostScript printer.andP;  This gives users the ability tochange graphics and text separately.andM;Mass-11's documentation is reasonably well-organized and extensivelycross-referenced, which makes it easy to find related features.andP;  Complexconcepts are illustrated with examples.andM;With the introduction of version 8.0 MEC has strengthened Mass-11's positionas a leading product in the VAX word processing market.andP;  The logical menusystem will help users take advantage of Mass-11's sophisticated wordprocessing and desktop publishing features.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
