<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-54-0706 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Buderus AG Wetzlar erected in its works Omnical Ewersbach an experimentalplant for the examination of combustion systems for solid fuels. Thesteam boiler of this plant has been operated with an atmospheric fluidizedbed firing system without and with a recirculation of ash as well aswith a newly developed watercooled advance feed grate. By the firingof different solid fuels, the operating behaviour of the mentioned firingsystems has been examined. As a result the recirculation of ash in thefluidized bed firing, a considerable improve of the firing and emissionvalues could be obtained. It had been proved that the feed grate canbe safely operated. The combustion results are excellent and the emissionvalues according to 'TA-Luft' (Clean Air Technical Guide) could be achieved.In order to reduce the NO/sub 2/-values, the flue gas recirculation anda step by step dosage of the combustion air have been tested.
