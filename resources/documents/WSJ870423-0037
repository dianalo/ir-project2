Sales rose 8% to $2.6 billion. But profit from continuing operations declined, and net rose only because of a total of $45 million in earnings from discontinued operations and in estimated gains from the sale of those operations. Profit from continuing operations fell 11% to $153 million, or 87 cents a share. The company said higher profit and sales volume for home furnishings, high-density polyethylene and brakes for passenger cars and light trucks were more than offset by lower profit margins resulting from an unfavorable sales mix, particularly in aerospace business, and by higher expenses for automotive and aerospace development programs. Allied-Signal has aerospace, automotive products and engineered materials businesses. </TEXT></DOC>
