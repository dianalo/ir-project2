They conceded that a marked change in focus is coming for traditionally tight-lipped Texaco, which has long touted its retail presence in all 50 states and has rarely shared projects or information with other oil companies. &quot;We're willing to be smaller as long as we're more profitable,&quot; said Chief Executive Officer James W. Kinnear.    As Texaco struggles to rebuild itself, however, it remains unclear what lies ahead for the company. Corporate raiders Carl C. Icahn and T. Boone Pickens Jr. are circling. Sources say Mr. Icahn has claimed that several investors have offered to join him in making a friendly bid. Hanson Trust PLC is one of those investors, sources say, but officials at the London-based conglomerate declined to comment.    No such proposals would be welcomed, said Mr. Kinnear. &quot;This company isn't for sale,&quot; he said. &quot;We're not soliciting any offers and we don't want any. And I would fight any hostile offer.&quot; Mr. Kinnear added that although he and Mr. Icahn speak frequently, neither the New York investor nor anyone else has talked with him about acquiring Texaco.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texaco shares closed up $1, at $45.25, on volume of 3.4 million shares.    As for Texaco's plans to sell refining and marketing operations, Mr. Kinnear declined to identify any prospective buyers other than to confirm previously reported negotiations with Saudi Arabia. Another Texaco official said that Saudi Arabia still has the inside track to purchase half of Texaco's U.S. refining and marketing operations along the East and Gulf Coasts. The same executive added that Texaco has talked with Kuwait Petroleum Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Statoil, Exxon Corp. and British Petroleum Co. about setting up joint ventures in Europe.    As previously reported, Texaco filed last April 12 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from creditors to forestall enforcement of a $10.3 billion judgment awarded to Pennzoil Co. by a Texas jury in December 1985. The judgment arose from Pennzoil's claim that Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. illegally interfered with a prior Pennzoil contract to buy part of Getty. Texaco and Pennzoil reached a $3 billion settlement in December.    Analysts are leery of Texaco's shift to exploration and production. Historically, Texaco has scored poorly in this area. It has had one of the highest finding costs per barrel of oil, said William Brown III, analyst for Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    But Texaco argues that its abysmal record has been reversed. Although its reserve base declined slightly last year, Texaco replaced 70% of its combined oil and gas production, compared with 46% in 1986, but 1987 production was lower than in 1986. Texaco's per-barrel finding and development cost fell to $4.10, compared with $6.72 in 1986 and $8.90 in 1985. In addition, promising discoveries in the early 1980s are being reflected now in Texaco's reserve picture. Positive revisions in the reserve base, partly from enhanced oil recovery, also are playing a part.    Yesterday, Texaco announced the successful testing of two oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana. One in the Mississippi Canyon tested at a flow rate of 1,156 barrels of oil and 751,000 cubic feet of natural gas a day. Another well in the Viosca Knoll Block, owned jointly with Exxon Co. U.S.A. and Nippon Southern U.S. Ltd., tested at a daily rate of 1,846 barrels a day. Texaco hopes that further testing will prove the presence of two medium-sized fields at these locations.    Although Texaco intends to dedicate most of its U.S. exploration budget to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, the company also seeks &quot;elephant&quot; oil fields overseas. It expects to spend 50% of its $600 million exploration budget this year on foreign prospects, up from 38% last year.    Texaco expects to start drilling its first wildcat well today in its most promising &quot;prospective elephant,&quot; in Brazil at the mouth of the Amazon River, said Elton Yates, senior vice president, world-wide operations. He says this prospect has similar characteristics to the North Sea, and covers a larger area. &quot;Seismic, geochemical analysis and sedimentation studies&quot; lead us to these conclusions, said Mr. Yates, who said Texaco is sharing the prospect with Petrobras, Brazil's national oil company.    Mr. Yates said Texaco intends to explore &quot;smarter,&quot; by &quot;concentrating our efforts&quot; on larger tracts in fewer areas. &quot;Now we're using a rifle, not a scatter gun,&quot; Mr. Kinnear said.    Texaco said that since it created a &quot;frontier exploration&quot; group last July to spearhead exploration, it has obtained concessions to explore 6.5 million acres off the coast of India, 8.1 million acres in Paraguay and 2.3 million acres both offshore and in North Yemen. In addition, the frontier group has signed a production sharing pact with Indonesia and entered an exploration venture with Exxon to examine 1,000 miles of a rift from Connecticut to Georgia. It's also searching for oil on Africa's west coast and offshore Australia.    Texaco is also looking in Alaska, undaunted by its participation several years ago in the Mukluk consortium that constructed an island before drilling the world's largest dry hole. Texaco intends to bid in May for oil leases off Alaska in the Chukchi Sea, Mr. Yates said. </TEXT></DOC>
