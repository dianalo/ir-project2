Johansson, the treasurer of Bell andamp; Howell Co., left the office early. &quot;We didn't really understand what was happening or why it was happening,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I wasn't going to do anything to change events by sitting there and watching the screen.&quot;    So Mr. Johansson left -- to attend a PTA meeting.    If the response of Bell andamp; Howell and its top executives to the stock market's worst one-day plunge is typical of other corporations -- and it may well be -- that's good news for the economy. Here in Skokie, there is no talk of sharp drops in orders, no last-minute cramming of no-growth assumptions about gross national product into 1988 budget planning, no new cutbacks in capital spending, production or employment. If the stock market has signaled a recession, in short, nothing that Bell andamp; Howell is doing seems likely to help precipitate it.    All this may change, of course. &quot;The $64,000 question is what effect will it {the stock market} have on our business,&quot; says Gerald Schultz, the president. Indeed, the market's plunge continued yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 156.83 points, its second-biggest point loss, to 1793.93.    In the eight days since the market crashed, Bell andamp; Howell has put a lot of effort into answering that question. Salesmen are sounding out their customers, and sales managers are tracking incoming orders for any hints of a slowdown. So far, there are none.    Nevertheless, some lower-level executives have decided, on their own, to take precautions. One is considering speeding up some already-scheduled layoffs. Another is thinking of preparing contingency plans for a recession. But Bell andamp; Howell's top executives haven't ordered any such efforts.    Indeed, many Bell andamp; Howell people see the stock-market crash as a blessing in disguise. They hope that the lower interest rates that followed the crash will postpone a recession and that the government will finally start balancing its budget. Already, they have reaped some benefits: Last Tuesday, the company reinstated a stock-repurchase plan that high stock prices earlier had forced it to abandon.    Meanwhile, executives and employees alike are heaving sighs of relief. Many are confident that the stock-market slide has wounded, at least temporarily, the raiders who have been circling the company. With the raiders routed, Bell andamp; Howell executives expect to have more time to get down to running the company.    Last Monday began almost normally for Bell andamp; Howell. That day, executives first detected something amiss at 10 a.m.: Bell andamp; Howell's stock hadn't opened for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &quot;The bid was 54, the ask was 62,&quot; Mr. Schultz recalls. &quot;My first reaction was that maybe it was a mistake. I'd never heard of that big a disparity before.&quot;    Others mistakenly thought that the problem lay with their own company. Before last Monday's stock-market drop, the big worry at Bell andamp; Howell had been takeovers. Since last month, Macmillan Inc., the New York publishing company, had bought a 6.6% stake in Bell andamp; Howell and said it may seek control. Earlier this month, an investor group including Robert M. Bass of Fort Worth, Texas, said it had raised its Bell andamp; Howell stake to 11.1%.    Thus, when a co-worker asked David Smith, a vice president in the business-equipment group, whether he had heard the news, &quot;We've been hearing so much about Macmillan and the Basses lately, I assumed it was that,&quot; Mr. Smith says.    But it quickly became clear that it was no mistake -- and no raider. &quot;As we talked, we realized this wasn't a usual day,&quot; Mr. Schultz says. Adds Mr. Johansson: &quot;This was history in the making.&quot;    Everyone jostled for information. Mr. Johansson made twice as many phone calls as usual, to brokers and securities analysts. Bell andamp; Howell's chairman, Donald Frey, usually checks stock prices once a day; that Monday, he punched up the stock price on a quote machine once an hour: &quot;I was absolutely enthralled watching that sucker, wondering, 'How far is it going to drop?'&quot;    The first question: Should Bell andamp; Howell buy back its own stock? Last July, the company had announced it would buy back 1.2 million of its own shares, but it had suspended the program when takeover rumors had pushed the stock above $70 a share. As the stock dropped below $50, executives decided to leap back in. But that day, they discovered just how far it is from Skokie to Wall Street.    Phone lines into the computer were so jammed that Tim Croasdaile, the company's investor-relations officer, couldn't get electronic quotes. He had to keep calling securities analysts. Other officers trying to decide whether to buy back Bell andamp; Howell shares were frustrated when they couldn't get through to floor brokers.    By Tuesday morning, it was easier to place an order. The company bought back 20,200 shares that day. It bought more shares later last week. And it plans to keep buying. &quot;This is a terrific buying opportunity,&quot; Mr. Croasdaile says.    These days, conventional wisdom holds that bargain-basement prices increase the danger from hungry raiders. But Mr. Frey believes that raiders can't buy companies with money they can't raise. Noting that many raiders have sustained big losses in the market and that many planned takeovers now seem to be up in the air, he says: &quot;I think there has been a fundamental change that makes my life easier. If there's a raider facing bankruptcy, maybe there are a dozen more that won't come back. For a while at least, you've hurt, frightened and otherwise scared them.&quot;    For Mr. Frey, the market's decline has already changed the way he does business. The 64-year-old chairman, who plans to retire next May, had been worrying that raiders would ruin his plans to have Mr. Schultz succeed him.    After Monday, Mr. Frey, the longtime chairman and architect of Bell andamp; Howell's shift from a camera maker to a textbook-publishing and information-services company, says he is more confident that his handiwork will remain intact. &quot;I can turn the company over to the management team rather than to the Bass brothers or Macmillan. It was sheer joy.&quot; And the new team will have more time to get a grip on the tasks at hand, he believes. &quot;That's a significant turn for my successor management,&quot; he says. &quot;It's one thing to run a company under threat, another to run a company.&quot;    Throughout the company, executives and managers say they share Mr. Frey's relief. Before, takeover tensions had forced Mr. Schultz, the president, to meet with small groups of employees in company divisions, tackling their questions and quelling anxiety. But after the crash, says Joan Andrew, a Bell andamp; Howell marketing manager: &quot;People are real happy. Up and down the chain, people said: 'Good. Looks like we'll be left alone.' People stopped telling jokes about how we were going to become McBass andamp; Howell.&quot;    Meanwhile, employees were trying to assess the damage to their personal finances and, if possible, limit it. A divisional human-resources manager says more than 100 employees called last Tuesday and Wednesday; many of them were hoping to switch their money from a stock-based profit-sharing fund to a less-risky fixed-income fund. Bruce Buscetto, a regional service manager, frets that stockmarket uncertainty will discourage prospective buyers for the condominium that he is trying to sell; he worries about carrying two mortgages.    Mr. Schultz mentally tots up his personal losses in Bell andamp; Howell's stock and arrives at a figure of $1.8 million, Monday's drop in the value of his stock options. (Bell andamp; Howell stock closed yesterday at $45 a share, down sharply from $67.50 on Oct. 15, the day before the market started plunging.) Mr. Schultz doesn't need a calculator because, he says, &quot;When you have stock options, you carry those numbers in your head.&quot;    Some employees are unsympathetic with the plight of their superiors. &quot;Those guys didn't lose anything,&quot; a lower-level manager says. &quot;They were given those options outright -- no matter how far {the stock price} declines, they still come out ahead.&quot; This manager, on the other hand, is still smarting from a big loss on his recent purchase of shares in other companies. &quot;I paid my own money for that,&quot; he says.    An economic slowdown, if it comes, might not affect many of Bell andamp; Howell's businesses, such as textbooks and the manufacture of mail-handling equipment, for six months or more. Meanwhile, Mr. Frey says, the company will look closely for &quot;telltale&quot; signs of a slump. &quot;We'll look at order rates, monthly business reviews and what the backlog is doing,&quot; he says. And, he adds, &quot;I watch retail sales and consumer-goods sales, and I watch the commodity market.&quot; But, he says, &quot;If you ask me how it adds it up in my head, I can't tell you.&quot;    A few managers are thinking of the worst. Before leaving the office on Black Monday, Phil Clement, vice president for administration, jotted himself a quick note for this week's budget meetings. &quot;What are we doing about planning for a recession?&quot; it read. &quot;We have to be sure we have some contingency planning available,&quot; Mr. Clement says. &quot;Retrospectively, it's something we should have done anyway.&quot;    Jerome Herb, the chief financial officer, says, &quot;There is certainly a better probability for Randamp;D or marketing programs -- or any discretionary programs -- to be cut back more than in the past. That doesn't mean they will, but with the uncertainty, the probability is there.&quot;    W. James Donaldson, the managing director of the company's European operations, intends to accelerate planned staff reorganizations and cutbacks. He says, &quot;When something like this happens, you say, 'Let's get on with it. Let's do the right thing quicker than we might otherwise do it.' If you go through horrible experiences like cost cutting, your profit is going to go up. Nobody likes to do it, but it almost always works.&quot;    But few are contemplating radical action. Mr. Buscetto, the regional service manager, says he will merely be more careful about buying extra tools and parts or &quot;anything that might cause the company extra expense. I don't think what we went through was an absolute disaster,&quot; he says. Mr. Smith of the business-equipment group says he hasn't any plans to change hiring levels.    Says David Gump, who manages a Bell andamp; Howell business selling computerized inventory-control systems to auto dealerships: &quot;My business didn't go up when the market went up. Why should it go down when it goes down?&quot;    Others, conceding that a downturn may occur, are thinking of ways to exploit it in the marketplace. &quot;When things are good,&quot; says Ms. Andrew, the marketing manager, &quot;we stress automation, convenience and technology for our products. When things are bad, we talk a lot about labor savings.&quot; In addition, she says, the marketing people have started discussing creative leasing packages; Bell andamp; Howell's customers tend to lease rather than buy during downturns.    Mr. Schultz likes that kind of thinking. &quot;The people who make out in periods of change are the people who see which way things go first,&quot; he says. He quotes a friend who flies airplanes: &quot;Bad weather is when a pilot earns his pay.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
