A Panamanian publisher attending IAPA's mid-year meeting saiddrug traffickers have ``hijacked'' his country and there will be nopress freedom there until Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega leaves power.   Gilberto Arias of the newspaper Extra said the army closed thethree independent daily newspapers and major radio and televisionstations ``when they refused to be muzzled.'' The newspapers areExtra, La Prensa and El Siglo.   IAPA represents more than 1,300 newspapers in the United Statesand Latin America. A special report on press freedom in thehemisphere is scheduled for release Thursday.   Anthony Day of the Los Angeles Times reported advances inCongress and the Supreme Court for the cause of free expression inthe United States.   But Day criticized Pentagon restrictions on news coverage ofU.S. military operations in the Persian Gulf and Honduras. He isvice president for the United States of the IAPA Freedom of thePress Committee.   Day told the press freedom committee that news coverage has beenlimited in the gulf and last week, when the United States sent3,200 soldiers to Honduras, the Pentagon sent its national mediapool of 10 correspondents with them.   ``Such pool coverage, though on occasion necessary for swift andsudden operations, is most unsatisfactory for long-term coverage,as in the Persian Gulf,'' he said.   He described as a step in the right direction a new law thatrestricts the government's right to refuse entry to foreigners``because of any past, current or expected beliefs or associations,which, if engaged in by a U.S. citizen in the United States, wouldbe protected under the Constitution of the United States.''   According to Day, IAPA sought the congressional action after theImmigration and Naturalization Service refused entry to PatriciaLara, a reporter for El Tiempo in Bogota. The government contendedshe was a member of the leftist M-19 guerrillas, which she denied.   Day said the new law represents progress but the governmentstill may use reasons of foreign policy or national security todeny entry to people linked to terrorist actions or activities.   ``I myself fear that the government might use these exceptionsto keep people arbitrarily out of the country,'' he said. ``Itseems to me that Patricia Lara could still be denied admissionunder the law.''   Another problem with the law is that it applies only for theremainder of the Reagan administration, he said. Day said IAPA,mainly through the efforts of Edward Seaton of Seaton Newspapers inManhattan, Kan., took the lead in pressing for legislation andshould try to strengthen and extend it.   Day applauded a Supreme Court ruling in February guaranteeing``parodists, caricaturists and other amusing rascals'' the sameFirst Amendment protections ``as the more sober-sided members ofthe press have,'' in its ruling on the Rev. Jerry Falwell's damagesuit against Hustler magazine.   The magazine published a phony advertisement depicting Falwell,leader of the Moral Majority, in what the court described as a``drunken incestuous rendezvous with his mother.'' It said publicfigures have many ways of protecting themselves against vitrioliccriticism and tasteless parodies without suing their critics.   ``So we in the United States are in debt to Hustler magazine,''Day said. ``As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court decision iswelcome financially as well as morally. Its decision greatlyinhibits the filing of libel suits.''   Arias told the committee ``journalists work under constantthreats'' in Panama, where ``there is no freedom of the press andthere won't be until the dicatorship of Gen. Noriega ends.''   Several foreign journalists have been detained or refused entryto Panama, where Noriega is the power behind the civiliangovernment as chief of the 15,000 Defense Forces.   Noriega has been indicted on drug charges in Florida, the UnitedStates has cut off the flow of cash to his country and the Reaganadministration is trying to force him into exile.   ``Panama has been hijacked by drug traffickers'' who are capableof ``shutting down the canal at any moment,'' Arias said.   ``For a dictatorship accused of drug trafficking, hostile tohumanity, hostile to all democratic and civilized forces, it is notdifficult to sink a ship at the entrance of the Panama Canal.''   He and other speakers said much of the threat to the press inLatin America is linked to the region's drug traffic.</TEXT></DOC>
