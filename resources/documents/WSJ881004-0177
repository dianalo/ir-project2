Republicans are euphoric as the vice president proclaims that voters have given him a mandate to &quot;continue and expand upon the Reagan-Bush legacy.&quot;    A mile down Pennsylvania Avenue, that mandate looks quite different. The Democrats control the 101st Congress, winning an additional Senate seat for a 55-45 advantage and losing only four House seats to keep a 253-182 edge. All of these successful House Democrats ran ahead of George Bush in their home districts.    &quot;I'll compare our mandate with the vice president's any day he wants,&quot; defiantly counters one congressional Democratic leader.    ---   The first purpose of any election is to win. But it's equally important to tell voters what you want to do with that victory. That's what a mandate is.    So far in this campaign, the vice president has dramatically changed the political dynamics, cleverly keeping Michael Dukakis on the defense by expertly utilizing the cultural/patriotic symbols of the Pledge of Allegiance and his opponent's membership in the American Civil Liberties Union. But while he's giving voters a reason not to vote for Michael Dukakis, he isn't giving them much reason to vote for him. That, some of the more prescient political observers believe, could come back to haunt a President Bush.    Political analyst Kevin Phillips sees major governing problems resulting from the Republicans' &quot;holding the presidency for four more years by using obsolescent cultural/patriotic issues to boost a fading coalition.&quot; A Bush-Quayle administration, he predicts, may be marked by &quot;inadequate 1989-92 governance,&quot; which could well cost Republicans and conservatives in the long run.    The failure of the Bush campaign to project a positive message stands in sharp contrast to Ronald Reagan in 1980. Like Mr. Bush today, Mr. Reagan used symbols effectively and attacked his opponent. But unlike Mr. Bush, he also laid the groundwork for governing.    That 1980 victory didn't simply reflect discontent with the Democrats. President Carter started off that year ahead of all his potential GOP rivals. But on issues ranging from tax cuts to curbing government regulation to building up America's defenses, Ronald Reagan set an agenda that provided the framework for the successful first Reagan term.    Does anyone seriously believe that voters will wake up this Nov. 9 and have any similar clear notion of what a Bush or Dukakis administration will mean?    The lack of a mandate is likely to plague either man, but it's a more acute problem for George Bush. For one thing, Michael Dukakis brags about wanting to work with a Democratic Congress; the vice president's agenda would be far more at odds with Congress's, and thus will depend more on public support to convince legislators. Secondly, the Republicans have set the tone for this campaign. Guided by the shrewd hand of James Baker and the almost minute-by-minute polling of Bob Teeter, the GOP handlers decided early on that this contest would be a triumph of imagery over issues. Practically every decision is guided by what makes the best 15-or 30-second sound bite on the evening TV network shows.    Presidential campaigns shouldn't be run for the convenience of the press. But the carefully choreographed Bush campaign is designed to let voters, as well as the press, know as little as possible about what a President Bush would do. Thus, it was no surprise last weekend when the Associated Press ran a story about George Bush as the &quot;stealth candidate.&quot;    The Bush formula is simple. If the Democrats are making strides on an issue, make a quick parry: Promise to appoint a Hispanic to the cabinet, say you're going to be the &quot;education president,&quot; embrace environmentalists for a few days, suggest you're for an increase in the minimum wage or promise a savings tax break for middle-class taxpayers. Then quickly move back to the attack on patriotism or traditional values or crime.    As a tactic, this plainly is working. Republicans justifiably delight in the frustration it's causing Democrats. But, with an eye to governing after an election, it ought to worry some Republicans, too, especially GOP conservatives who are vitally interested in where a President Bush would stand on the budget deficit or the Strategic Defense Initiative or Third World struggles or trade policy, to name a few. Being for the flag and against the ACLU doesn't help much in sorting this out.    The problem isn't that Mr. Bush reverts to symbols. Most successful politicians do; the symbols employed by a Roosevelt or a Reagan told us something about how they would try to govern. By contrast, the flag and the ACLU are effective attack weapons, but they tell us precious little about what Mr. Bush would do as president; one thing this patrician son of Yale isn't is a cultural conservative.    Former top Reagan political operative Ed Rollins recently noted that a victorious George Bush must be able to go to Congress next January and say, &quot;'Listen, these are the items I ran on. . . . This is what the American public wants.'&quot; If instead the campaign comes down to Mr. Bush simply &quot;having better negative commercials,&quot; Mr. Rollins says, it will be &quot;much harder to govern.&quot;    In 1981, Ronald Reagan was able to wave a public mandate at Congress: tax cuts, spending cutbacks and a much tougher defense posture. Here's a good test as to whether George Bush, if he wins, will have a comparable mandate next January. What do you think would be the top three priorities of a President Bush? If that's hard to answer, he'll be in trouble.    ---   Mr. Hunt is chief of the Journal's Washington bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
