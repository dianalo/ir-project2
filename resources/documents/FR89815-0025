These revisions were the result of a continuing reappraisalof the NFIP from the standpoint of achieving greater administrative andfiscal effectiveness and encouraging sound flood plain management so thatreductions in the loss of life and property and in disaster expenditurescould be realized.In response to the proposed rule, 38 comments were received. Of these comments,eight dealt with flood plain management issues, 30 with flood hazard identificationissues.<ITAG tagnum="84">Flood Plain Management Provisions</ITAG>The revisions to NFIP flood plain management criteria are intended to clarifyor further explain provisions in those criteria or to liberalize certainrequirements. Since this is the case, communities participating in theNFIP are not required to amend their flood plain management regulationsto incorporate the revised language. However, in communities where administrationof provisions in the past has been inconsistent or contrary to any of therevisions, those communities are encouraged to amend their regulationsaccordingly.Of the eight responses received addressing flood plain management issues,four were from State governments, three from national associations, andone from local government. Most of the comments were in support of theintent of the flood plain management rule changes and agreed with themin principle. These respondents did, however, offer recommendations toimprove or further clarify the language or make the proposed requirementsmore restrictive. Two of the respondents were in opposition to one or moreof the proposed changes.Analysis of the comments resulted in minor changes to some provisions andthe inclusion of additional language in one definition to bring about consistencywith language proposed for another provision.Within the eight responses, comments were also made about flood plain managementprovisions not specifically addressed in the proposed rule. These commentswere also analyzed and are discussed herein under the heading of ``MiscellaneousComments on Substantial Improvement''. However, no action is being takenon these comments in the final rule since there would be no opportunityto allow for public comment. FEMA will consider these comments in theirevaluation of issues for inclusion in future rule making.<ITAG tagnum="84">Substantial Improvement</ITAG>In the proposed rule, FEMA included a number of revisions to the definitionof ``substantial improvement'' in andSection;59.1 which are intended to clarifyportions of that definition. The proposed revisions addressed the followingthree areas that have been identified as being in need of clarification:substantially damaged structures, historic structures, and cost exemptionsfor correcting health, safety, and sanitary code related violations.The creation of a separate definition for substantial damage in the proposedrule resulted from problems communities were having interpreting the substantialimprovement definition in cases where a building was substantially damagedand either not fully repaired, or repaired using discounted or donatedmaterials and labor. The new definition codifies FEMA's policy interpretationthat a building is substantially damaged, and thus a substantial improvement,when it sustains damage from any cause, whereby the cost of fully restoringthe structure to its pre-damaged condition equals or exceeds 50 percentof the market value of the structure before damage occurred, regardlessof the actual repair work performed.Two associations and two States commented in support of the substantialdamage definition. However, one State suggested that the definition ofsubstantial improvement be modified to read ``the term includes structureswhich have incurred substantial damage, as defined herein, regardless ofthe value of or actual costs of repair work performed.'' Placement of theterm substantial damage in quotation marks in the substantial improvementdefinition directly references the term as defined in andSection; 59.1 ofthe regulations. Thus there is no need to use the term defined herein assuggested.FEMA does not agree that the suggested additional language value of or* * * costs of should be added to the substantial improvement definition,because the intent of the requirement is apparent in the language as proposed.The same State called for clarification in the case of improvements madeto substantially damaged structures costing less than 50 percent. The respondentwas concerned that the regulations do not explicitly state that such improvementsmust meet elevation and other NFIP requirements. FEMA notes that regardlessof the level of repairs made to the structure once it is substantiallydamaged, the structure immediately becomes a substantial improvement andmust comply with all of the applicable flood plain management requirementsin andSection; 60.3. FEMA believes that these conditions are clear in thedefinitions of substantial improvement and substantial damage and the referencesto substantial improvement in andSection; 60.3 of the NFIP regulations.FEMA points out that the enforcement of the substantial improvement requirementsshould occur at the time the initial permit for repair is submitted, regardlessof the amount of repairs called for in the permit. In the majority of cases,substantially damaged structures will be condemned by the local buildingcode department, necessitating repairs prior to reoccupancy. This shouldnot only prevent unpermitted improvements from being made to substantiallydamaged structures, but also should ensure that when required repairs aremade (regardless of the level), that the substantial improvement requirementsin andSection; 60.3 are enforced.One State questioned the rationale for requiring substantially damagedstructures, for which less than 50 percent repairs are made, to meet therequirements of substantial improvement. FEMA's rationale is based on post-floodexperience gained through FEMA Regional NFIP and Hazard Mitigation activities.Experience has shown that substantially damaged structures initially repairedto less than 50 percent, are, over time, fully repaired and many timeseven improved beyond the value of the structure prior to damage. Minimalor partial repairs are often made initially to substantially damaged structuresto allow for reoccupancy as required by safety or building codes, or becauseof the limited monies available to many victims immediately after a flood.However, in subsequent years as monies become available or as other conditionspermit, these structures are ultimately fully repaired, and in many casesfurther improved. The substantial damage definition was thus created toreduce the amount of unprotected investment in flood hazard areas due tothese situations. FEMA points out that in some form, the Federal Government(the NFIP, various disaster assistance programs, etc.) would likely beobligated to pay a significant portion of the future damages to these unprotectedstructures.The proposed rule also modified the substantial improvement definitionto explicitly state that the costs required to remedy code deficienciesare deductible from the cost of the improvement for the purpose of determiningsubstantial improvement only if (1) and appropriate regulatory officialsuch as a building official, code enforcement officer, fire marshal, orhealth officer was informed about and knew the extent of the code relateddeficiencies; (2) the deficiencies were in existence prior to the repairor improvement and not triggered solely by the fact that the structureis being improved; and (3) it is the minimum necessary to bring the deficienciesinto conformance with code requirements.One State wrote in support of the new language covering deductions forcode related deficiencies, but also expressed concern that the cost ofimplementing flood damage reduction (floodproofing or retrofitting) measuresfor structures would be counted toward substantial improvement and thatthis is contrary to sound flood plain management.However, this has not been a common problem. Because of the infrequentsituations where the additional cost of floodproofing measures has triggeredthe substantial improvement requirement, FEMA does not believe that anadditional exclusionary provision for floodproofing measures in the substantialimprovement definition is necessary at this time.The same respondent also raised concern that local officials would objectto the added responsibility of documenting all substandard conditions instructures prior to their improvement and that this is not an everydaypractice of building officials. FEMA understands that local building officialsdo not make a practice of surveying structures in order to document allitems not compliant with the local building code. FEMA is not suggestingthat local officials assume such a responsibility. The burden of documentingand proving that certain improvements are deductible because they are neededto fix substandard conditions rests with the permittee (owner or contractor).<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous Comments on Substantial Improvement</ITAG>Comments from two associations and one State supported the substantialimprovement rule changes, but recommended that the present 50 percent thresholdbe reduced or that a fixed monetary sum or square footage measurement beused instead. The issue of changing the substantial improvement thresholdwas not addressed in the proposed rule and therefore no action is beingtaken on it in the final rule since there would be no opportunity to allowfor public comment. Also, any changes made to the threshold, either byincreasing or decreasing the percentage or by changing to a fixed monetaryor square footage criteria, would require flood plain management ordinancerevisions for the nearly 18,000 communities participating in the NFIP.FEMA does not wish to require ordinance revisions at this time due to theburden it would place on communities, NFIP State Coordinating Offices,and FEMA Regional Offices.FEMA notes that the substantial improvement threshold of 50 percent wasinitially chosen because it generally conformed with established zoningstandards for non-conforming uses and some national building code requirementsthat also use a 50 percent threshold.In its ongoing evaluation of the substantial improvement requirement, FEMAhas concluded that, at this time, the promotion of more effective enforcementof the present requirement, through technical assistance, guidance andeducation, is a more practical first approach for mitigating flood losses,as opposed to making the requirement more restrictive.Another State indicated that there is an inequity in the relative sizeand value of improvements that can be made to structures of different sizeand value. It was stated that very large and costly improvements can bemade to very large and costly structures without triggering the substantialimprovement requirement. Whereas, very small improvements can often triggersubstantial improvement requirements on low valued structures. To remedythis situation, it was suggested that a square footage increase insteadof a monetary percentage be used as a threshold.FEMA notes that a square footage criteria can also create inequities. Forinstance, it may preclude making additions to large industrial or commercialstructures. In addition, the exclusive use of a square footage criteriawould not address those improvements such as rehabilitations that do notinvolve an increase in a structure's surface area.One State addressed the situation where several incremental improvements,each less than 50 percent, are made to a structure, such that cumulatively,over time, these improvements exceed 50 percent. It was mentioned thatthese incremental improvements are not covered by the current definitionof substantial improvement which evaluates improvements on an individual,or improvement-by-improvement basis.This issue was not addressed in the proposed rule and therefore is notbeing considered in the final rule. FEMA does note, however, that one difficultyin implementing a national standard for tracking permits over the lifeof a structure is that many smaller or more rural communities do not havethe capability and expertise to inspect and keep accurate records of cumulativeimprovements. In addition, there are a number of administrative problemsand equity issues in requiring such an approach.Many communities across the country have chosen to adopt a more restrictivesubstantial improvement requirement that requires the cumulative trackingof permits. FEMA encourages the adoption of these more restrictive standardsin a community's ordinance and recognizes the precedence that these standardshave over the minimum NFIP requirements.One State recommended that FEMA define the term market value in the regulationsand provide guidance and technical assistance documents on its use in determiningsubstantial improvement. FEMA recognizes that there is some confusion aboutwhat the market value of a structure is and how it should be determinedfor the purposes of substantial improvement. FEMA also recognizes thatthere is a need to provide clarification to communities on how market valueis to be determined in ways acceptable to FEMA.However, many States and communities already have market value definedin State zoning enabling legislation or property taxation legislation.FEMA believes that it is more desirable at this time not to impose a potentiallyconflicting definition on states or communities, but to provide them withthe flexibility to use their own definition. In addition, the issue ofmarket value was not addressed in the proposed rule. It would not be appropriateto establish a definition of market value in a final rule without firstgiving the public a chance to comment.Therfore, FEMA has chosen not to define market value in the regulationsat this time. It should be noted that for the purposes of determining substantialimprovement for the NFIP, the market value of a structure includes onlythe value of the structure in question_not the land, landscaping, detachedaccessory structures, or the geographic location of the structure. In determiningsubstantial improvement, the value of the land must always be subtracted.Various appraisal and real estate associations have different versionsof the definition of market value. However, these definitions do not varya great deal and a general definition of market value reads as follows:The most probable price for which the appraised property (in this casejust the structure in question) will sell in a competitive market underall conditions requisite to a fair sale, with the buyer and seller eachacting prudently, knowledgeably, and for self-interest and assuming thatneither is under duress.It should be noted that FEMA has distributed a document entitled ``Questionsandamp; Answers: Substantial Improvement andamp; Substantially Damaged Structuresin Post Disaster Situations''. A part of this document addresses the useof market value and provides acceptable alternatives to estimate it. Inthe near future FEMA will publish this document in final form. Also inthe near future, FEMA will publish a substantial improvement guidance documentfor local permit officials. A significant portion of that document willdiscuss acceptable ways to determine substantial improvement, includingtechniques for estimating, and sources for obtaining or verifying, bothmarket value and cost of improvements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Historic Structures</ITAG>The proposed rule included a separate definition in andSection;59.1 for ``historicstructure'' which is consistent with the Department of the Interior (DOI)definition of ``certified historic structure''. In addition, language wasproposed for andSection;60.6(a) to clarify that variances granted to historicstuctures (1) should be only the minimum deviation from NFIP criteria thatis necessary to assure that the historic character and design of the structureis not destroyed (i.e., the minimum necessary to afford relief) and (2)must not preclude the continued designation of a structure as a historicstructure as defined by the NFIP.The intent of the proposed modification was to clarify the current definitionof substantial improvement and the procedures covering variances as theyrelate to the exclusions of historic structures. Also, through the useof objective identification criteria of the DOI, the intent was to helpreduce the number of non-historic structures that were mistakenly exemptedfrom NFIP requirements due to confusion about what constituted a historicstructure. The new definition should help promote more effective identificationand verification of historic structures because the new NFIP criteria areconsistent with DOI criteria. In addition, communities will now be ableto fully utilize existing Federal and State listings for historic structures.Under the new definition, another benefit will be that if an alterationmade to a structure results in a loss of DOI status, the structure willalso lose its NFIP status as a Historic Structure. If that alteration constitutesa substantial improvement the structure must comply with NFIP requirementsfor new construction. One State and one association suggested that the rule change as proposedwould create a conflict between the exclusion of historic structures inthe substantial improvement definition and the treatment of historic structuresin the variance provisions (the substantial improvement definition as proposeddid not provide ``minimum necessary to afford relief'' language and a safeguardstatement to ensure that alterations to a structure do not preclude itscontinued designation as a historic structure). It was suggested that thereference to historic structures in the variance section be deleted becauseit would always be superseded by the language in the substantial improvementdefinition.Some communities have adopted ordinances that require variances for improvementsto historic structures and do not exclude such improvements from the substantialimprovement definition. These communities must follow the variance criteriawhich contains a clause for the ``minimum necessary to afford relief''.FEMA agrees that as proposed there is potential for confusion between thevariance and substantial improvement procedures because the variance criteriais somewhat more restructive on the treatment of historic structures. Althoughthe two procedures differ on this matter, communities have the option ofusing either procedure.Rather than delete the requirements in the variance section as suggestedby one association, FEMA will also add the safeguard provision proposedfor the variance provisions to the substantial improvement definition,which will help ensure that structures do not lose their DOI designation.This condition is already implicit in the existing substantial improvementdefinition and constitutes a clarification, rather than an expansion ofthe definition.FEMA is not at this time adding a ``minimum necessary to afford relief''clause to the substantial improvement definition. The treatment of historicstructures in the variance criteria can be amended without changing ordinancesto address the ``minimum necessary to afford relief'' issue, because itis already in the variance criteria. However, a similar provision can notbe added to the substantial improvement definition without requiring ordinancerevisions because it would be more restrictive than the current definition.One association expressed concern that the inclusion of local certifiedhistoric structures in the definition could lead to abuse of the substantialimprovement exclusionary provisions for historic structures. The new NFIPdefinition of ``historic structure'' includes structures individually listedon a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservationprograms that have been certified either by an approved State program ordirectly by the Secretary of the Interior. FEMA notes that many of theselocally certified structures are already on the National Register of HistoricPlaces and that the total number of structures exempted by this requirementshould increase very little. In fact, as previously mentioned, the moreobjective identification criteria of the DOI will help reduce the numberof non-historic structures that were mistakenly excluded from the substantialimprovement requirement in the past due to confusion. As already noted,under the new definition, another benefit will be that if an alterationmade to a structure results in a loss of DOI status, the structure willalso lose its NFIP status as a ``Historic Structure''. If that alterationconstitutes a substantial improvement the structure must comply with NFIPrequirements for new construction. <ITAG tagnum="84">Start of Construction </ITAG>The proposed rule modified the definitions of ``substantial improvement''and ``start of construction'' by adding the terms ``rehabilitations'' and``additions'', and removing the term ``reconstruction''. FEMA felt thatthe terms ``rehabilitation'' and ``addition'' better describe the typesof improvements that actually occur to structures and are terms more commonlyused in the building industry. However, one State suggested that the term``reconstruction'' not be deleted because it more adequately describesthose cases where an entire structure is demolished and a new one is builton the old foundation or slab. FEMA agrees and will retain the term ``reconstruction'' in the definitionsof ``start of construction'' and ``substantial improvement'' while leavingthe terms ``additions'' and ``rehabilitations'' as proposed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Development </ITAG>In the definition of development, the proposed rule added ``storage ofequipment and materials'' to the examples of activities subject to communitypermit requirements. The intent of the modification was to clarify theexisting definition so that communities would understand that continuousstorage operations such as lumber yards and automobile junk yards are developmentand are subject to permit requirements and the ``no rise'' floodway (andSection;60.3(d)(3)) and one-foot rise flood plain (andSection; 60.3(c)(10)) encroachmentprovisions. One State favored the addition of the term ``storage of materials and equipment''to the definition, but suggested that the terms ``extraction'' or ``deposition''of materials also be added. The terms ``mining'', ``dredging'' and ``filling''in the present definition are generally applicable to the suggested terms``extraction'' and ``deposition''. Therefore, FEMA thinks that adding theseadditional terms is unnecessary. All earth moving activities that alterthe landscape have always been included in the definition of developmentand should be regulated by a community. One local and one State government opposed the additional language, arguingthat it would cause confusion and add an unnecessary and extra burden onlocal permit officials, and that they would have to regulate even the smallestand most temporary storage activities. FEMA makes a distinction betweenthe very temporary storage of materials and equipment in flood hazard areasand those storage activities associated with continuous or seasonal businesses,construction operations, or other commercial and industrial enterprises.Transient activities such as the short term parking of heavy equipmenton a construction site in a flood hazard area or the brief roadside storageof sand and salt piles in anticipation of impending winter storms wouldconstitute temporary storage. FEMA does not consider these to be examplesof ``development'', but temporary activities that a community should beaware of, but not necessarily subject to flood plain permit requirements.The permanent or seasonal operation of storage yards for pieces of disabledor unemployed heavy equipment or the continuous but fluctuating storageof thousands of board feet of lumber associated with logging or saw milloperations are examples of ``development''. Such storage is subject tolocal permit requirements including the regulations under andSection; 60.3(c)(10)and (d)(3). It is a community's responsibility to make a prudent and reasonable distinctionbetween types of storage activities. This distinction should be based onconsiderations such as the length of storage time, nature of the materialsor equipment, physical characteristics of the flood plain, and characteristicsof the flood flows. As a guide, the smaller the flood hazard area and longerthe storage time, the more concerned a community should become with theplacement of materials and equipment and the impact it would have on storageand conveyance of flood waters. FEMA believes that most communities have always required permits for thestorage of equipment and materials. The addition of the term ``storageof equipment and materials'' is simply a clarification, not an expansion,of the ``development'' definition and should not significantly affect thepermit requirements of a community. The essential point is that equipmentor material permanently or seasonally stored on a site (regardless of whetherthe total volume of the storage seasonally fluctuates) represent an encroachmentwhich may increase flood levels during the base flood. One State specifically objected to the inclusion of the term ``storageof equipment and materials'', arguing that the development definition hasalways been interpreted to pertain exclusively to construction activities.It was stated that some communities have enacted single purpose flood plainmanagement ordinances or base their ordinances on building codes and thuscan only regulate the construction of buildings. FEMA emphasizes that communitiesmust have provisions in their ordinances, regardless of whether they aresingle purpose or based on building codes, to regulate land use throughthe permitting of those development activities which do not entail theconstruction of buildings. Ordinances which do not have such provisionsare deficient and will not allow a community to properly enforce the minimumrequirements of the NFIP. Many activities besides the construction of buildings,including the ``storage of equipment and materials'', can cause increasesin floodflows and exacerbate a community's flood problems, and must beregulated.FEMA will finalize the definition as proposed and believes that most communitieswill continue to be able to make responsible determinations about the storageof materials and equipment without unnecessarily burdening their permitprocedures. However, at the suggestion of one association to provide furtherguidance to ensure that the added language does not cause confusion, FEMAwill distribute policy guidance to its Regional Offices.<ITAG tagnum="84">New Construction</ITAG>In the proposed rule, the definition of ``new construction'' in andSection;59.1 was modified to affirm FEMA's interpretation that the term also includesany subsequent improvements to a structure that already meets the definitionof ``new construction''. In explaining this modification in the supplementaryinformation of the proposed rule, FEMA stated that the ``substantial improvement''definition applies to existing structures, and that once a structure meetsthe definition of ``new construction'', any further improvements to thatstructure must meet ``new construction'' requirements. While this is true,FEMA would like to clarify, based on comments received from one State andone association, that substantial improvement applies to two differenttypes of structures: (1) All existing structures; i.e., structures builtprior to the adoption of a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) by a communityand (2) ``New Construction'' (Post-FIRM structures) in communities thathave undergone map revisions resulting in areas with more restrictive zonedesignations (e.g., A-Zone to V-Zone) of increased Base Flood Elevations.Substantially improved post-FIRM structures located in areas affected bymap revisions must be brought into compliance with regulations applicablefor the revised zone designations and BFEs which became effective afterthe structure was built.Over time, this distinction will become more important, as more FIRMs arerevised and more post-FIRM structures become subject to substantial improvementrequirements. Therefore, FEMA cannot change the definition to strictlyapply to existing structures as suggested by one State and one association.<ITAG tagnum="84">Enclosures Below the Lowest Floor</ITAG>Paragraph (c)(5) of andSection; 60.3 was revised in the proposed rule tomake it clear that the openings requirement in that paragraph applies onlyto enclosures that are usable solely for vehicle parking, building accessor storage. The intent of this change was strictly for convenience purposesand eliminates the need to refer back to the definition of ``lowest floor''.One association expressed concern that this clause would not include structuresthat have unusable enclosures such as crawl spaces below the lowest floor,and that this may result in a failure to apply the openings requirementto these crawl spaces.It has always been FEMA's interpretation that the inclusion of unusableenclosed areas below the lowest floor such as crawl spaces is implicitin the defintion of ``lowest floor''. The lowest floor definition containsa clause which limits use for enclosures. Not using a space meets thislimitation on use. In addition, although the definition does not explicitlyreference unusable areas, few problems to date have arisen from misinterpretation.FEMA notes that many crawl spaces are in fact used to access utilitiesor for limited storage. FEMA does not envision a problem because of thisclarification and does not believe that it is necessary to modify the ruleas proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Flood Hazard Identification Provisions</ITAG>Of the 30 responses received addressing flood hazard identification issues,18 were from local governments, six from national or state associations,three from regional agencies, two from state governments, and one froma private firm. The majority of the comments received were directed tothat portion of the proposed rule dealing with the use of alternative hydrologicand hydraulic computer models in the submission of map revision requests.It was the consensus of these respondents that portions of the proposedrule were too restrictive and they suggested that it be expanded. The finalrule contains language which amends a portion of the proposed rule to reflectthese comments. The remainder of the comments received were on that portionof the proposed rule involving alluvial fans. Several varied concerns werediscussed. As a result of some of these concerns, minor changes were madeto the proposed provisions covering alluvial fans.<ITAG tagnum="84">Use of Alternative Hydrologic or Hydraulic Computer Programs</ITAG>When a map revision requestor is seeking to revise effective base floodelevations the existing NFIP regulations require the requestor to the samecomputer model that was used to develop the effective base flood elevationsunless it can be demonstrated that the original computer model is unavailableor its use is inappropriate. In order for an alternative computer modelto be accepted by FEMA, the program must be accepted for general use bya governmental agency or notable scientific body, must be well-documentedincluding a user's and programmer's manual and must be available to thegeneral user.The proposed rule expanded this portion of the NFIP regulations by providingclarification of the criteria for acceptable computer programs submittedto FEMA as supporting data for a request to revise base flood elevationdeterminations. Specifically, the proposed rule included an explanationof ``governmental agency'', ``notable scientific body'' and the requirementthat the alternative computer program be available to the general user.``Governmental agency'' was defined by the proposed rule as being an agencyof the Federal government that was responsible for water resource activities.``Notable scientific body'' was limited by definition to the National Academyof Sciences or comparable organizations and specifically excluded individualuniversities and colleges. The requirement that the alternative computerprogram be available to the general user was interpreted to mean that theprogram source code will be sent to FEMA free of charge with fully documentedpermission from the owner that FEMA may release this information and theuser's manual to whomever requests it.The changes in the regulations advanced by the proposed rule were thoughtto be necessary to: Eliminate confusion regarding the terms used; ensureadherence to the same engineering standards applied in the preparationof the original map and FIS report; assure that information based on alternativecomputer models is scientifically and technically correct and; guaranteethe availability of the data and methodology documentation to ensure thatthe right of the community and other property owners to review and appealthe new analysis, or to submit subsequent map revision requests based onthe new analysis, is not infringed upon.The bulk of the comments received were directed to that portion of theproposed rule dealing with the use of alternative hydrologic and hydrauliccomputer models in the submission of map revision requests (19 of the 30correspondents commented in this regard). Three of the respondents wereNational or State associations, two were state agencies, three were regionalagencies and eleven were local government agencies.It was the consensus of 18 of these respondents that the proposed definitionof ``government agency'' was too restrictive and they suggested that itbe expanded to include the NFIP's state coordinating agencies and otherorganizations engaged exclusively or predominantly in flood and stormwatermanagement activities. They commented that Federal agency methodologiesare notably deficient in their treatment of certain flow conditions and/ortypes of localized storms and rainfall patterns and that locally availableprograms can provide superior solutions to these problems. They also contendedthat standards and methods developed by local agencies with operating responsibilitiesare far more likely to be locally correct in application. Further, theyposited that securing a Federal agency's endorsement of a non-Federal agencyactivity is not reasonable because of the Federal agency's bias in theperformance of flood-related analyses and assessments. They expressed theopinion that, ``* * * the NFIP is a community program and that study methodologyfor flood risk analyses must be characteristic to the affected communityand not limited to Federal ideology and scope.'' They also voiced concernthat one major Federal agency has recently stopped supporting its computerprograms and given the current funding situation other Federal agenciesare likely to follow suit. Finally, they noted that there is no regulatorysubstitute for the judgment of an experienced and knowledgeable engineerfamiliar with local conditions and methodologies.Only one respondent stated that the restriction described in the proposedrule would result in a uniform approach to problem-solving which is clearlya bonus to the local communities.Four of the respondents stated the opinion that the requirement for computerprograms to be in the public domain would eliminate the incentive for computerprogram development and would stifle a source of innovation that is manytimes larger than that available within the Federal agencies. They pointedout that NFIP studies, restudies and map revisions represent the potentialmarket for many Ph.D. theses aimed at improving the science of hydrologythrough the development of new computer programs and expressed concernthat individuals producing such theses could not hope for an economic returnon their research if the research results were to be made available tothe public at virtually no cost. One commentator also noted that ``approved''Federal computer programs are remarkably antiquated, many still retainingtheir ``batch process'' orientation from their original 20-year old formats.Three respondents favored the requirement that computer programs be inthe public domain. One of these stated that it supported the clarificationof the phrase ``available to the general user,'' a second remarked thatit has no problem with the requirement that the alternative methodologybe available to the general user, while the third endorsed the conceptbecause it would result in a uniform approach to problem-solving, whichis clearly a bonus to local communities.The 18 respondents that took exception with the requirement of the proposedrule, that an alternative computer program be approved by an agency ofthe Federal government before being accepted for use in processing a maprevision request, raised several concerns that have merit.It was not the intent of the proposed rule to require Federal methods tobe used for local flood control design or local regulatory programs, norwas it the intent to require local agencies to adopt methodologies thatwere nonresponsive to unique and localized phenomena. Rather the languageof the proposed rule was developed to assure that there was adherence tothe same engineering standards applied in the preparation of the originalmap and FIS report and that when requesting changes to NFIP maps and FISreports, adequate supporting data and documentation be submitted to allowFEMA to review and evaluate the requests and to carry out its responsibilityto ensure that the information to be presented is scientifically and technicallycorrect. Also, an underlying intent in attempting to clarify guidance asto which computer programs would be acceptable is to ensure consistencybetween the original analysis and the analysis performed for the map revisionrequest so as to prevent the introduction of discrepancies that may beattributable solely to model differences. FEMA was also concerned withthe proliferation of computer programs and the role of the Agency in reviewing,testing, and verifying such programs when they were submitted as the basisfor flood insurance map revisions.Locally adopted and sponsored methodologies that are alternatives to federallyendorsed and sponsored methodologies may have been used in preparing theoriginal map and FIS reports. Therefore, the Agency has no objection tothe use of these same alternative methodologies when revisions to the originalmap and FIS reports are requested. However, when such methodologies, ornewly developed methodologies have been incorporated into a computer program,FEMA needs to assure that the program has been adequately reviewed andtested and that it is available for further review and testing by thoseparties who have a right to appeal flood map changes based upon its use.The final rule contains language which amends the pertinent portion ofthe proposed rule to reflect this view and to specify when a computer programthat has not been previously accepted by an agency of the Federal governmentmay be used to request a map revision. In general, the final rule providesfor the use of computer programs which have been reviewed, tested, andaccepted by Federal, state or local government agencies with responsibilityfor flood control or flood plain land use regulation.FEMA believes it has a strong obligation and a public trust to assure thatthe data and methodology documentation is available to communities andproperty owners likely to be impacted by the map revision and that theright of the community and property owners to review and appeal the newanalysis is not infringed upon. Also, a similar guarantee of access tothe data and methodology to impacted property owners is necessary to assurethat the updating of base flood elevations and maps will occur in a consistentand efficient manner as hydrologic or hydraulic conditions change in thefuture.The proposed rule contained language that may have caused the respondentsto have misconceptions as to who would be provided copies of the methodologydocumentation (e.g, computer program source codes) and data. The finalrule has been reworded to make it clear that only those present and futureparties impacted by flood insurance mapping developed or amended throughthe use of the computer program will be entitled to this consideration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Mapping and Revision of Areas Subject to Alluvial Fan Flooding</ITAG>The revisions to andSection;andSection; 59.1 and 65.13, setting forth FEMA'spolicy for issuing map revisions for SFHAs on alluvial fans, are necessarybecause of the high-hazard environment on active alluvial fans, the currentlevel of interest in their development, and an increasing demand for mapchanges for areas on alluvial fans.Alluvial fans are geomorphic features characterized by cone- or fan-shapeddeposits of boulders, gravel, sand, and fine sediments that have been erodedfrom mountain slopes, transported by floodwater draining upstream watersheds,and then deposited on the adjacent valley floor. Active alluvial fans areareas of extreme hazard subject to flash floods and high-velocity flows.Unlike riverine flooding, which is associated with permanent channels andidentifiable floodplains, or shallow flooding characterized by slow-movingsheetflows, flooding that occurs on active alluvial fans is characterizedby fast-moving debris and sediment-laden shallow flows. The paths followedby these flows are prone to lateral migration and sudden relocation toother portions of the fan. In addition, these fast-moving flows presenthazards associated with erosion, debris flow, and sediment transport.Alluvial fans occur in a variety of environments, particularly in arid,semi-arid, or seasonally dry regions, where the sediment supply is largeenough that deposition can occur. Such locations are particularly commonalong faulted or tectonic mountain fronts in California, Colorado, Nevada,Utah, Oregon, Texas, Arizona, Idaho, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, andWashington; however, alluvial fans are also found in Alaska, West Virginia,Kentucky, and Tennessee. Some of the fastest-developing areas of the UnitedStates are in the arid and semi-arid southwestern regions, where alluvialfans occupy a large portion of the land area.For flood insurance purposes, FEMA has chosen the 100-year flood as thebase flood for the determination and mitigation of flood hazards and forsetting insurance rates. However, the technology of mathematically modelingthe hydrodynamics of water and debris flows on alluvial fans is still inthe early development stage. Therefore, the estimation of the values ofthe various hazard parameters associated with the base flood is highlyuncertain for alluvial fans.Further research is needed to provide better understanding of the factorsthat affect alluvial fan flooding, including: the hydrology of the watershedsabove and below the apex; the effects of alluvial fan geometric characteristics,sediment source, and quantity; the effect of sediment on channel avulsion;the stability of flood channels on alluvial fans; the location and extentof the distinct hydraulic zones on the fan; the determination of the stabilityof existing man-made structures during major flood events; and the effectsof those structures on the natural alluvial fan boundaries.In addition, the state of the art for the design and construction of otherthan major structural projects (i.e., whole fan protection projects) isnot well developed. The efficacy of more localized projects in providingprotection from fan hazards is not well-known or readily assessable. Furtherresearch is also needed to investigate construction techniques and to assessdesign parameters for the construction of flood mitigation structures onfans. Unfortunately, the needed research will take time to complete.Given the present interest in development on alluvial fans, the high-hazardenvironment that is present on active alluvial fans, and the increasingdemand for Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) changes for such areas, FEMAhas identified the need to develop a policy for issuing map revisions forSFHAs in such areas. FEMA believes that it is prudent to take a conservativestance concerning the removal of the SFHA designation, and its associatedlender notification and mandatory insurance purchase requirements, fromactive alluvial fans. FEMA will, therefore, consider as a basis for maprevisions involving active alluvial fans only major structural flood mitigationmeasures that are supported by appropriate engineering analyses.Such measures should be designed to mitigate all hazards associated withactive alluvial fan flooding, which include inundation, erosion, scouraround structures, and debris and sediment flow and accumulation, in additionto aggradation and degradation of the conveyance systems. In addition,the short- and long-range effects of such measures on adjacent propertiesmust be considered. Major mitigation structures may include, but are notrestricted to, diversion dikes, flood walls, detention basins, and diversionchannels with inlet and outlet systems.Several communities employ special construction standards and zoning regulationsfor flood mitigation in developments on alluvial fans. While such approachesare encouraged, their efficacy in the control of floodwaters on alluvialfans is uncertain. Therefore, FEMA will not generally recognize such approachesby themselves as an adequate basis for map revision.Because of the complexities associated with the many variables affectingflooding on alluvial fans and the lack of information with which to quantifythe major fan hazards and provide the appropriate construction techniquesfor structures on alluvial fans, the creation of an overall developmentmaster plan of flood control, drainage maintenance, and floodplain managementis encouraged by FEMA. Such plans allow for strategic management of alluvialfans at the early stage of development. At this stage, the community isafforded a number of alternatives for dedicating specific portions of thefan to both structural and nonstructural measures that will address theunique hazards associated with alluvial fan flooding.Eleven of the responses on the proposed rule commented on the part involvingalluvial fans. These respondents included seven local governments, oneprivate engineering firm, two associations, and the National Wildlife Federation(also writing on behalf of the Coast Alliance and the Natural ResourcesDefense Council).The primary issue addressed by several respondents was that not all alluvialfans or similar landforms (or parts thereof) are subject to the types offlood hazards assumed by the proposed rule. They expressed a concern thatif an area of special flood hazard is on an alluvial fan that is no longeractive (i.e., not subject to aggradation by sediment or shifting flow paths),it could be removed from the FIRM only as a result of structural floodmitigation measures, even though data may exist that demonstrate that thearea is not subject to the flood hazards assumed by the proposed rule.To remedy this apparent shortcoming, the respondents suggested that theproposed definition of alluvial fan be revised by including a descriptionof landforms that are similar to alluvial fans but not subject to the sametype of flood hazards and a description of the processes of alluvial fanformation that result in parts of the alluvial fan being isolated fromthose flood hazards.In reviewing these responses, FEMA recognized that the language in theproposed rule identified a particular landform (i.e., alluvial fan) andnot a particular type of flood hazard. The purpose of the proposed rulewas to establish the design criteria and data submittal requirements forcrediting, on a FIRM, a structural flood-control measure with protectingan area identified as being subject to alluvial fan flooding_not an areasimply identified as being on an alluvial fan. Therefore, rather than definingan active alluvial fan, the final rule defines the type of flooding (i.e.,alluvial fan flooding) to which it applies. Note that the final rule doesnot preclude FIRM revisions based on improved hydrologic, hydraulic, ortopographic data or on technical data identifying errors in the originalflood analysis. Data requirements and submission procedures for those typesof requests are described in andSection; 65.6.One respondent expressed a concern that the proposed definition of apexmay not be adequate when applied to the analysis required in the proposedrule (in andSection; 65.13(c)(1)). In particular, he pointed out that, onsome alluvial fans, entrenched channels exist that convey floodwaters fromthe mountain front to some point farther down the alluvial fan. In such cases, the apex is not the point of highest elevation on the alluvialfan, but rather is the point at which the entrenched channel terminatesand flood flows emerge onto the unentrenched fan surface. Because ``apex''was referred to in the proposed rule at the point at which certain analysesare to apply, the definition has been replaced with one that lends itselfto flood hazard analyses. On ``younger'' alluvial fans, whose drainagebasins offer an abundant sediment source, the apex is typically at themountain front. On ``older'' alluvial fans, an entrenched channel may existthat isolates the upper portions of the fan from all but the rarest offlood events, thus rendering those portions ``inactive.'' The apex on the``older'' alluvial fans is typically at the downstream end of the entrenchedchannel. On some alluvial fans, entrenchment may not have evolved to such an extentthat the entrenched channel has the capacity to convey all flood flowsrelevant to flood insurance applications. In that case, a point analogousto an apex may exist at the downstream end of the entrenched channel (applicablefor flood flows whose magnitudes are less than the channel capacity) alongwith the apex at the mountain front (applicable for flood flows whose magnitudesare greater than the channel capacity). Five respondents expressed concern that andSection; 65.13(b) of the proposedrule excluded areas subject to alluvial fan flooding from the provisionsof Part 70, which is the vehicle to remove parcels of land that have beeninadvertently included in an area of special flood hazard. Because of theadditional flood hazards associated with alluvial fan flooding, elevationdata, as required under part 70, may not be enough to show that a parcelof land has been inadvertently included in a SFHA. In addition, becausecommunity involvement is not necessary for map amendments processed underpart 70 and because FEMA wishes to encourage community involvement in thedevelopment of areas subject to alluvial fan flooding, requests for FIRMrevisions in such areas are more appropriately processed under part 65(specifically, andSection; 65.5). Nevertheless, an appellant could submittechnical data demonstrating that his or her property is not subject toactive alluvial fan flooding and, therefore, falls within the conditionsprovided for in part 70. One respondent expressed concern with a statement in andSection; 65.13(b)of the proposed rule excluding the provisions of andSection; 65.5 regardingmap revisions based on the placement of fill. Specifically, this respondentsuggested that the following statement was unclear: ``In general, topographicalterations alone, by fill or other means, will not serve as a basis forremoving SFHA designations from alluvial fans.''The ``Supplementary Section'' of the proposed rule did contain informationwhich would have helped the respondent understand the context of the referencedportion of the proposed rule. Summarized, this information states, ``FEMAwill, therefore, consider as a basis for map revisions involving alluvialfans only major structural flood mitigation measures that are supportedby appropriate engineering analyses.'' These structural flood mitigationmeasures may involve topographic alterations. However, because of the extremelyerosive nature of high-velocity flood-flows on alluvial fans and theircapacity to carry large sediment loads, the placement of fill, by itself,does not preclude the undermining and flooding of structures elevated inthis manner. Therefore, individual structures or parcels of land that havebeen identified as subject to alluvial fan flooding will not be excludedfrom SFHAs only by means of topographic alterations unless these alterationsoccur in conjunction with structural flood-control measures that are supportedby appropriate engineering analyses. Hence andSection; 65.13(b) containslanguage to recognize that while topographic alterations may occur, theyin general, will not serve as a basis for removing areas subject to alluvialfan flooding from SFHAs. One respondent pointed out that because of the uncertainty associated withthe flood flow path in alluvial fan flooding, the design discharge describedin andSection; 65.13(c)(1) may have less than a one-percent probability ofimpacting any particular point downfan from the apex. He suggested thatthis uncertainty be taken into consideration when defining the design dischargefor flood-control measures. FEMA recognizes that the probability of flooding by a particular dischargeevent occurring at a fan apex generally decreases as the fan widens. Thisdecrease in flooding probability is taken into consideration by FEMA inestablishing the downstream limits of the SFHAs on alluvial fans. Althoughthe precise location of a flood path in a particular event may be unpredictable,the one-percent-annual-chance (100-year) discharge event at the apex willbe experienced, once every 100 years, on the long-term average, somewherewithin the SFHA. If the SFHA were spanned by individual structural flood-protectionmeasures designed to alleviate flood hazards only up to those with a 100-yearreturn interval defined at the specific site (i.e., considering the uncertaintyin the flood flow path), then the 100-year flood defined at the apex, whenrealized, would exceed the design of all individual measures; thus, 100-yearflood protection would not be achieved on the alluvial fan as a whole.Therefore, prudence dictates that a structural flood-control measure, inorder to be credited on a FIRM with affording protection from alluvialfan flooding, should be designed to protect against the hazard associatedwith the 100-year flood defined at the apex. One respondent recommended that andSection; 65.13(c) be expanded to requireanalyses showing that a proposed development project ``will not exacerbatethe flood, erosion, or landslide hazards on the alluvial fan or areas upor downstream from it.''As discussed previously, FEMA believes that the creation of an overallmaster plan that balances flood control and drainage needs with those ofthe planned development is the responsibility of the community. This responsibilityis addressed, in part, under the flood plain management program regulationsspecified in part 60. By requiring that the impact of any flood-controlmeasures be assessed and approved by the community and other agencies withjurisdiction over the placement of flood-control structures, the finalrule assures that the community and other agencies are afforded the opportunityto exercise this responsibility. FEMA is responsible for accurately depictingthe flood hazards as they exist. The community and other responsible agencieshave the obligation and authority to assess any adverse impacts causedby flood-control measures. Therefore, FEMA must depict the effects, regardlessof their nature, of such flood-control measures.Two respondents expressed the opinion that, contrary to FEMA's determination,the proposed rule has a significant economic impact and should undergoa regulatory flexibility analysis.FEMA believes that the rule does not have a significant impact becausethe rule only defines the criteria for crediting, on a FIRM, a structuralflood-control measure with protecting areas subject to alluvial fan flooding.If such credit is not sought, the rule has no impact. The mapping of anarea subject to alluvial fan flooding as a SFHA does not prohibit or limitdevelopment of a site. Also, the insurance cost by itself does not havea significant impact. While this designation does subject the site to insurancepurchase requirements, minimal elevation (usually 3 feet or less in AOZones) of new construction yields rates that are lower than those associatedwith most other areas subject to these requirements.Seven respondents agreed with FEMA that further research is needed to providebetter understanding of the factors that affect alluvial fan flooding.Four of those correspondents questioned the adequacy of current technologyto address the analyses required under andSection; 65.13 (c) and (d). Severalrespondents expressed the opinion that the rule should not be promulgateduntil the basic research is completed or a list of approved techniquesis developed, and called for Federal funding to support a program of researchand technology development. FEMA considers the current technology, in combinationwith appropriate factors of safety, adequate to produce designs of flood-controlmeasures that protect an area from the hazards of alluvial fan flooding.FEMA has reviewed several approaches used to support requests for FIRMrevisions that adhered to and met the objectives of andSection; 65.13 andresulted in the requested revisions.To allow for the utilization of advances in technology without continualadjustments to the regulations, FEMA remains flexible in defining techniquesthat can be used to satisfy the requirements of andSection; 65.13 (c) and(d) in accordance with andSection; 65.6(e) of its existing regulations, wherebyimproved methodologies resulting from ongoing research may be utilizedto effect map changes. FEMA therefore believes that it is not prudent tospecify methodology in the regulations.With reference to the suggestion that rule promulgation be delayed untilthe state of the art is more advanced, FEMA believes it must respond witha rulemaking at this time to meet the increasing demand for FIRM revisionsfor areas subject to alluvial fan flooding. An alternative would be toretain the designation of alluvial fan flooding regardless of the extentof flood protection installed. Such an approach would be unfair to thoselocal jurisdictions with heavy investments in adequately designed flood-controlmeasures. This rulemaking has the flexibility to incorporate new technologyas research continues and fulfills the aforementioned demand.The final rule adds definitions for ``Alluvial Fan Flooding'' and ``Apex.''Additionally, the final rule amends part 65 to add a new section to establishthe policies, principles, and data requirements for mapping and revisingalluvial fan SFHAs.FEMA has determined, based upon an Environmental Assessment, that the finalrule does not have significant impact upon the quality of the human environment.As a result, an Environmental Impact Statement will not be prepared. Afinding of no significant impact is included in the formal docket fileand is available for public inspection and copying at the Rules DocketClerk, Office of General Counsel, Federal Emergency Management Agency,500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472.The final rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities and has not undergone regulatory flexibility analysis.The final rule is not a ``major rule'' as defined in Executive Order 12291,dated February 17, 1981, and hence, no regulatory analysis has been prepared.The information collection requirements contained in part 65 of this rulehave been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under theprovisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> and have been assigned OMB control number 3067-0147.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 44 CFR Parts 59, 60 and 65</ITAG>Flood insurance, Flood plains.Accordingly, 44 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter B is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 59_GENERAL PROVISIONS </ITAG>1.

(5) Engineering analyses that assess the effect of the project on floodhazards, including depth and velocity of floodwaters and scour and sedimentdeposition, on other areas of the fan.  (6) Engineering analyses demonstrating that flooding from scources otherthan the fan apex, including local runoff, is either insignificant or hasbeen accounted for in the design.  (d) Coordination. FEMA will recognize measures that are adequately designedand constructed, provided that: evidence is submitted to show that theimpact of the measures on flood hazards in all areas of the fan (includingthose not protected by the flood control measures), and the design andmaintenance requirements of the measures, were reviewed and approved bythe impacted communities, and also by State and local agencies that havejurisdiction over flood control activities.
