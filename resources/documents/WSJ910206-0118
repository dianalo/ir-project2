Corporate executives, directors and other insiders atrecreational-vehicle and motor-home companies have beenbuying their companies' stocks.</LP><TEXT>   Winnebago Industries Inc., Coast Distribution System,Coachmen Industries Inc. and Mallard Coach Co. are just ahandful of the companies involved, filings with theSecurities and Exchange Commission show.   By and large, the insiders' purchases were made when thestocks were near year lows, depressed on fears that oilprices would escalate because of the Persian Gulf conflict.So far, every insider who bought in the fourth quarter hasmade a paper profit.   Shares of recreational vehicle companies &quot;have been beatendown, and some of them are coming back in response to lowerinterest rates,&quot; said Robert Curran, analyst at Merrill Lynchandamp; Co. The Federal Reserve's willingness to keep pushing rateslower, he added, is &quot;a positive piece of the puzzle&quot; for theindustry.   But investors who consider following the insiders' leadshould know they're betting on a business with problems thatsurfaced long before Iraq invaded Kuwait, Mr. Curran added.   The recession has made discretionary large-ticketpurchases like recreational vehicles unattractive. Afull-size motor home sold for an average retail price of$59,239 in 1989 (the last year for which figures areavailable) according to the Recreational Vehicle IndustryAssociation, a trade group.   The industry generally &quot;is doing very poorly,&quot; agreedSandra A. Knell, chief financial officer of CoastDistribution, which makes replacement parts for recreationalvehicles and motor homes. But she bought Coast stock becauseshe felt it had been oversold to the point that it was abargain.   Ms. Knell, one of four insiders who recently bought stockin the San Jose, Calif., company, purchased 2,500 shares inearly December for $2 each. She also purchased 5,000 sharesfor $4.25 each shortly after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion, shesaid.   As recently as March, Coast Distribution stock had beentrading at about $7. Last spring &quot;the economy started to stoppeople&quot; from buying recreational vehicles, and &quot;on August2nd, they stopped using them,&quot; because of concern over highergas prices, or of not being able to get gas at all, she said.But its just a matter of being patient, she said. &quot;Once thewar ends, people will use them again.&quot;   Coast Distribution shares have inched higher since theinsiders' fourth-quarter purchases. Those purchases, at anaverage price of $1.97 a share, totaled 34,364 shares -- thelargest cluster of buying at the company in four years,according to SEC filings. Coast Distribution, which didn'ttrade yesterday, closed Monday at $3 a share, unchanged, inAmerican Stock Exchange composite trading.   At Winnebago Industries, director David Croonquistpurchased 22,000 shares for $49,500 on Dec. 31, SEC filingsshow. He paid $2.25 each for shares of the Forest City, Iowa,motor-home manufacturer. While not a huge purchase, the SECfilings show it was the largest one by a Winnebago insidersince October 1987. It also increased Mr. Croonquist'sholdings eightfold, according to the filings.   Mr. Croonquist couldn't be reached for comment. Aspokeswoman for the company said, &quot;The recreational vehicleindustry is traditionally one of the first hit in times of arecession, and some people are optimistic about the recessionending soon.&quot; Moreover, &quot;it could very well impact ourbusiness {positively} if people decide to travel in theUnited States because of terrorist acts abroad,&quot; she said.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Winnebagoshares closed yesterday at $4.125 each, down 12.5 cents.   At Mallard Coach of Nappanee, Ind., four insiders boughtshares between late October and the end of December, SECfilings show. &quot;We're in the middle of a very depressed marketcurrently, but this is a cyclical business,&quot; said J. PatrickKerich, the company's chairman. He figures the stock is &quot;anexcellent value at its current price.&quot;   Mr. Kerich said insiders also bought shares in January,but those purchases have yet to appear in the SEC data base.All told, Mr. Kerich himself bought 10,000 shares of thecompany in the past two months, he said.   The filings received so far show Mallard insiders havebought a total of 17,326 shares, most at $1.86 each. In Amextrading, Mallard shares closed yesterday at $3, up 25 cents.   Thomas Corson, chairman of Coachmen Industries of Elkhart,Ind., bought 20,000 shares of his company's stock in severalpurchases in October, spending a total of $82,600, SECfilings show. Another insider spent about $3,700 on 1,000shares, according to the filings. Mr. Corson declined tocomment. The two Coachman insiders paid share prices rangingfrom $3.63 to $4.13. In Big Board trading, Coachmen sharesclosed yesterday at $5.25, up 75 cents.   New rules for insider reporting may be delayed by theSecurities and Exchange Commission, agency officials said.The commission has been tinkering with the new rules sincethey were adopted Jan. 10 and has yet to issue the finaltext.   The plan was scheduled to go into effect April 1, but SECChairman Richard Breeden said the starting time would bedelayed if corporate officials wouldn't have enough time toimplement their reporting changes. Linda Quinn, the agency'slead staffer on the rule, said she hoped to get the finalrules in print next week, and stick to the original April 1date.   The rule will force companies to include a statement onthe cover of their proxy statements if certain executives orofficers haven't disclosed their stock trades to the agency.The SEC hopes the new rule will pressure executives todisclose stock trades in their own companies' stock on time.   The new rule also reduces the number of executives whomust disclose their trades. Under the new guidelines,executives with significant policy-making responsibilitieswill still be required to file, but officers who don't haveaccess to information that could lead to insider tradingabuses will be excluded.   ---   Kevin G.
