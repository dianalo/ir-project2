The United States has lobbied Bonn to accept a replacement forthe 88 Lance missile systems targeted at communist East Germany andCzechoslovakia. U.S. officials prefer new missiles able to strikedeeper into Warsaw Pact countries.   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz's comments drew immediate firefrom the Free Democrats, the government's junior coalition partner,and from opposition leaders. Scholz belongs to Chancellor HelmutKohl's Christian Democratic Union.   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a Free Democrat, hasargued that installing new systems could disrupt the positive trendin East-West relations.   Polls indicate West Germans are regarding Moscow with increasingfavor, with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev routinelyoutranking President Reagan in popularity.   In an interview released Wednesday by the Munich-based Buntemagazine, Scholz was quoted as saying of the Lance missiles: ``Youare talking about short-range nuclear weapons. There is no way toindefinitely get around modernization of these weapons.''   Defense Ministry spokesman Werner Widder told The AssociatedPress he could confirm the contents of the Bunte interview regardingthe Lance missiles.   He was asked if in fact the word ``modernization'' meansreplacing the systems.   ``That's exactly what it means,'' Widder told the AP.   Defense experts have said it would make no sense to overhaul thepresent systems. The systems, able to launch 600 individual missilesat their targets in the East, will become obsolete by 1995.   Widder also said Scholz ruled out a ``zero option'' for theshort-range missiles.   This calls for eliminating a category of nuclear missiles on bothsides, such as that provided under the U.S.-Sovietintermediate-range missile treaty signed in 1987.   Lance missiles have a range of up to 75 miles. Against them arearrayed 1,365 modern Soviet-built short-range missiles with a rangeof more than 180 miles.   A NATO replacement system for Lance would probably have a rangeof 240 miles, within the 300-mile limit specified for short-rangemissiles.   Olaf Feldmann, the Free Democrats' disarmament expert, toldreporters his party disagreed strongly with Scholz's remarks.   He said the Soviet superiority ``cannot be evened out by furtherWestern armament, but rather by disarmament.''   Egon Bahr, the disarmament expert for the opposition SocialDemocrats, told reporters Scholz's comments left the impression morethought was going into armament than into responding to Gorbachev'smissile proposals.   The Scholz interview with Bunte will appear on the newsstandsThursday. It was provided in advance to other news media.</TEXT></DOC>
