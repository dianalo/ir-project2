EPA previously established reportingthresholds for the first two years of reporting (52 FR 38344; October 15,1987). EPA also promulgated zero thresholds in that rulemaking to becomeeffective in the third year of reporting, but stated in the preamble thatit would conduct further studies of all reporting threshold alternativesand would propose final reporting thresholds before the beginning of thethird year of reporting.After completing its study of alternative thresholds, EPA published a Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing final reporting thresholds (54FR 12992; March 29, 1989). Because of the time required to address thecomments received on the NPRM and to promulgate a final rule, today EPAis publishing an Interim Final Rule extending, for manufacturing facilities,the reporting thresholds established for the first two years of reportingunder the October 15, 1987 rule. For manufacturers, promulgation of theInterim Final Rule, therefore, limits, for one more year from the currenteffective date (i.e., October 17, 1989), the hazardous chemicals that mustbe reported under sections 311 and 312 to those which are present in anamount equal to or greater than 10,000 pounds, or which are extremely hazardoussubstances (EHSs) present in an amount greater than or equal to 500 pounds(or 55 gallons) or the threshold planning quantity (TPQ), whichever islower.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>dates: </T2><T3>Effective date: </T3>Although EPA is soliciting comments until November13, 1989, and will change this Interim Final Rule if necessary, the InterimFinal rule is being promulgated as a final rule requiring no further EPAaction before becoming effective on October 17, 1989.

Statutory Authority These regulations are issued under sections 311, and 312 of Title III ofthe Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) (Pub. L.99-499; 42 U.S.C. 11001 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Title III is the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-KnowAct of 1986. B. Background of This Rulemaking Section 311 of Title III applies to the owner or operator of a facilitywhere there are hazardous chemicals present for which the owner or operatormust prepare or have available a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) underthe Hazard Communication Standards (HCS) (29 CFR 1910) promulgated underthe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Under section 311 of TitleIII, the owner or operator of a facility must submit individual MSDSs,or a list of chemicals for which the facility is required to have MSDSs,to the State Emergency Response Commission (SERC), the Local EmergencyPlanning Committee (LEPC), and local fire department. The HCS does notlist specific chemicals; a ``hazardous chemical,'' as defined in the HCS,is one that poses either a physical or health hazard. The tens of thousandsof chemicals covered by the HCS include petroleum products, explosives,and carcinogens. The HCS regulations were restricted initially to facilities in StandardIndustrial Classification (SIC) codes 20 through 39, that is, the manufacturingsector. On August 24, 1987, however, the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) revised the HCS to cover facilities in the non- manufacturingsector as well as facilities in the manufacturing sector (52 FR 51852).A challenge to the revised standards by several industrial groups resultedin a temporary stay for non-manufacturing facilities. On July 22, 1988,OSHA clarified that the HCS was in effect for non-manufacturing facilitiesas of June 24, 1988, except for the construction industry (53 FR 27679).On February 15, 1989, OSHA notified EPA that all provisions of the HCSwere in effect for all segments of industry, including the constructionindustry, as of January 30, 1989 (54 FR 6886). For facilities in SIC codes 20 through 39, the initial MSDSs or lists wererequired to be submitted to the appropriate SERC, LEPC, and fire departmentby October 17, 1987. Non-manufacturers were required to submit their MSDSsor lists by September 24, 1988 (i.e., three months after they became subjectto the HCS, as specified in 40 CFR 370.20(b)). Facilities in the constructionindustry were required to submit their MSDSs or lists by April 30, 1989.Thereafter, if a facility begins to use a chemical subject to the HCS ina quantity at or above the reporting thresholds, or if a facility learnsthat its previously submitted MSDS is inaccurate for any reason, the facilitymust submit the new or correct information within three months to the appropriateSERC, LEPC, and local fire department (40 CFR 370.21(c)).Under section 312 of Title III, owners and operators covered by section311 of Title III are required to submit additional information on the presenceand location of hazardous chemicals at their facilities. Beginning March1, 1988 for manufacturers, March 1, 1989 for non-manufacturers, March 1,1990 for the construction industry, and annually thereafter, all facilitiesaffected by the HCS that have hazardous chemicals at or above the reportingthresholds must submit a ``Tier I'' inventory form and may be requiredto submit a ``Tier II'' inventory form to SERCs, LEPCs, and fire departments.Tier I forms require general information on the amount and location ofhazardous chemicals by category; Tier I forms must be submitted annually.Tier II forms require more detailed information on individual chemicalsand must be submitted on request. Facilities may submit Tier II forms inlieu of Tier I forms.Title III (section 311(b)) states that the EPA Administrator may establishreporting thresholds (i.e., quantities of hazardous chemicals) such thatif the hazardous chemical subject to the HCS is present at a facility ina quantity that is below the reporting threshold, the facility is not requiredto report the presence of that chemical under the provisions of section311 and 312 of Title III. On October 15, 1987, EPA promulgated regulations(52 FR 38334) establishing reporting thresholds under section 311(b) ofTitle III for facilities subject to the OSHA HCS. The reporting thresholdestablished for the first two years was 10,000 pounds, except for EHSs,which must be reported at the lower of 500 pounds or the TPQ. Access toinformation below these thresholds was preserved in that facilities mustprovide any such information when requested in accordance with 40 CFR 370.20(b)(3).A threshold of zero pounds is currently in effect for the third year ofreporting; that is, there is no threshold as of the third year. For manufacturers,the third year of reporting begins on October 17, 1989; for non-manufacturers,the third year begins on September 24, 1990; and for the construction industry,the third year begins on April 30, 1991. In the final rule on thresholds,however, EPA intends to eliminate the different effective dates for variousindustry sectors and to establish uniform effective dates for all facilitiessubject to reporting requirements under sections 311 and 312. The uniformeffective dates are described and explained in detail in a SupplementalNotice published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4>EPA stated in the October 15, 1987 final rule that because of the substantialnumber and variety of comments received on the final threshold issue anduncertainty over the impact of the requirements on the recipients of thereports and ultimately on the effectiveness of the program, it would conductfurther studies of alternative thresholds and propose final reporting thresholdsbefore the beginning of the third year of reporting. On March 29, 1989(54 FR 12992), EPA published an NPRM proposing final reporting thresholdsbased on analyses conducted since the promulgation of the October 15, 1987final rule. EPA received 167 comment letters addressing issues raised inthe NPRM; 138 of the letters contained comments on the selection of finalthreshold levels. Many commenters supported maintaining the current reportingthresholds (i.e., 10,000 pounds for non-EHS hazardous chemicals and 500pounds or the TPQ, whichever is lower, for EHSs) as proposed in the NPRM,and some suggested alternative thresholds. EPA believes that it is notfeasible to consider properly and respond thoroughly to all the comments,and to finalize and promulgate final reporting thresholds before the zeropound threshold for manufacturers automatically goes into effect on October17, 1989. EPA believes that it is prudent, therefore, and in the publicinterest to extend the current reporting thresholds for manufacturers forone additional year. This short extension of current reporting thresholdsfor the manufacturing sector will provide EPA additional time to evaluatethe comments received on the NPRM and to promulgate final reporting thresholdsfor all facilities subject to reporting under sections 311 and 312 andEPA's implementing regulations.Although EPA is soliciting comments until November 13, 1989, and will changethis Interim Final Rule if necessary, the Interim Final rule is being promulgatedas a final rule requiring no further EPA action before becoming effectiveOctober 17, 1989. Today's rule is being issued as an Interim Final Rulebecause EPA believes that it is impracticable to solicit comments, respondto such comments, and issue a final rule on the changes in today's InterimFinal Rule before the October 17, 1989 reporting deadline for manufacturingfacilities. Also, today's Interim Final Rule does not make substantivechanges in the reporting requirements under sections 311 and 312 and EPA'simplementing regulations. EPA is merely extending the thresholds alreadyin existence for these provisions. Finally the extension promulgated isof limited duration as it extends current deadlines for just one additionalyear.Without the changes made by today's Interim Final Rule, the zero thresholdwould go into effect automatically on the dates currently specified in40 CFR 370.20. EPA does not believe that it is in the public interest toallow the zero threshold to go into effect for the short time requiredto promulgate final reporting thresholds that may differ from the zerothreshold. Allowing the zero threshold to go into effect for the shorttime necessary to complete the evaluation of the comments and alternativethresholds would impose a substantial burden on the regulated community,SERCs, LEPCs, and local fire departments without a commensurate publicbenefit.Neither does EPA want to promulgate final reporting thresholds withoutthoroughly reviewing and evaluating all comments and the many issues raisedby the commenters. Today's Interim Final Rule will allow the time necessaryfor EPA to evaluate and address all comments on the March 29, 1989 NPRMwithout imposing any additional burden on the regulated community, SERCs,LEPCs, and local fire departments. The Interim Final Rule will also enablethe Agency to promulgate a final rule giving the regulated community ampletime to prepare and submit required reports in accordance with the finalizedthresholds.The promulgation of today's rule should not be construed, however, to implyany evaluation of either the zero threshold or the 10,000 pound level asfinal reporting thresholds. All alternative thresholds will be discussedfully in the final rule, as will any additional issues raised by comments.EPA is aware that for non-manufacturers the zero threshold for reportingunder section 311 will go into effect on September 24, 1990, unless a finalrule is promulgated before that date. EPA intends to promulgate the finalreporting thresholds, however, well in advance of September 24, 1990, inorder to give the regulated community ample time to prepare and submitthe first reports required to be submitted in accordance with the finalthresholds. In addition EPA is proposing to extend the current second-yearthreshold for non-manufacturers from September 24, 1990 to October 17,1990 in a Supplemental Notice published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">II. Interim Final Rule</ITAG>A. Extension of the Two-Year Thresholds for ManufacturersBy extending the current reporting thresholds for manufacturers, today'sInterim Final Rule limits for an additional year the hazardous chemicalsthat must be reported by facilities in SIC codes 20 through 39 under sections311 and 312 to those that are present at the facility in an amount equalto or greater than 10,000 pounds, or at which EHSs are present in an amountequal to or greater than 500 pounds (or 55 gallons) or the TPQ, whicheveris lower. Accordingly, the following changes are made in 40 CFR 370.20:(1) the date specified at 40 CFR 370.20(b)(1)(ii) for reporting all hazardouschemicals present at a manufacturing facility in quantities between 10,000and zero pounds for which an MSDS has not yet been submitted is changedfrom October 17, 1989 to October 17, 1990; (2) the amounts specified at40 CFR 370.20(B)(2)(iii) for the third year of Tier I reporting for allhazardous chemicals present at a manufacturing facility during the precedingcalendar year is changed to amounts equal to or greater than 10,000 poundsor extremely hazardous substances present at the facility in an amountequal to or greater than 500 pounds (or 55 gallons) whichever is lower;and (3) the date specified at new section, 40 CFR 370.20(b)(2)(iv), isMarch 1, 1991, for reporting under the current final threshold for allhazardous chemicals and all extremely hazardous substances present at amanufacturing facility during the preceding calendar year in amounts equalto or greater than zero pounds.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Analyses</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact AnalysisA Regulatory Impact Analysis is not necessary for today's Interim FinalRule because it makes no change in current reporting thresholds but merelyextends those currently in effect for one additional year. Costs and benefitsassociated with reporting requirements under the thresholds specified at40 CFR 370.20 will remain unchanged.B. Regulatory Flexibility Act AnalysisA Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis is not necessary for the InterimFinal Rule because the impact of the current third-year reporting thresholdswas analyzed for the October 15, 1987 final rule and today's Interim FinalRule makes no change in the reporting thresholds or their impact on smallbusinesses.C. Paperwork Reduction ActOffice of Management and Budget approval is not necessary for this InterimFinal Rule because it has no effect on the reporting burden imposed by40 CFR 370.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 370</ITAG>Chemicals, Hazardous substances, Extremely hazardous substances, Intergovernmentalrelations, Community right-to-know, Chemical accident prevention, Chemicalemergency preparedness, Community emergency response plan, Contingencyplanning, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 29, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
