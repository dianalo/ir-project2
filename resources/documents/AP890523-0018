Bush attended a session of the cabinet-level Economic PolicyCouncil on Monday to hear arguments from both sides but gave noindication which way he would decide, according to one participant.   Under the 1,000-page rewrite of the trade law passed by Congresslast year, the administration must issue by May 28 a list ofnations judged to have erected the most flagrant trade barriersagainst U.S. products.   The administration then has 18 months to negotiate the removalof the barriers. If unsuccessful, it can retaliate by levyingtariffs up to 100 percent against imports from an offendingcountry, effectively doubling the price of those goods.   An administration source, who spoke on the condition that hisname not be used, said that Bush would settle the matter before heleft Friday for a trip to the 40th anniversary meeting of the NATOalliance.   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp said afterMonday's meeting that Bush had not made up his mind.   One option reportedly under consideration would be to narrowlytarget certain trade practices in Japan, India and Brazil ratherthan pursue a longer list of trading abuses.   The specific practices reportedly under consideration includeJapan's refusal to buy American-made satellites and supercomputersand its restrictions on U.S. lumber imports, Brazil'simport-licensing practices, and India's restrictions on foreigninvestment and foreign insurance companies.   By targeting particular trading practices but not listing theoffending countries by name, the administration would blunt thesting of the hit list, which has come under heavy attack by foreigngovernments.   The provision, which reflects congressional frustration over thehuge trade deficits America has run up in recent years, has deeplysplit the administration.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and U.S. TradeRepresentative Carla Hills have said that failure to name severalcountries, including Japan, to the hit list runs the risk of aprotectionist backlash in Congress.   But Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser, andBudget Director Richard Darman have countered that targeting Japan,America's closest ally in the Pacific, would harm broader U.S.interests.   Boskin earlier this month warned that U.S. efforts to retaliateagainst its trading partners could spark a trade war and lead to aworldwide recession.   Hills recently told reporters that in the last month she hasseen a parade of trade officials seek to make concessions in aneffort to stay off the so-called Super 301 list.   Because of such concessions, it's considered likely that SouthKorea, Taiwan and the European Community will not be named to thelist.   South Korea has moved aggressively to reduce the number ofoutstanding trade disputes with the United States, agreeing justlast week to remove several barriers to American products.   On Friday, Hills and Frans Andriessen, her counterpart with the12-nation European Community, announced that the two sides hadagreed to follow procedures established by the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade in resolving U.S. complaints about Europeansubsidies for oilseed and a European complaint involving U.S. sugarquotas.   The announcement was seen as an effort to ease trade tensionsbetween the United States and the EC. But Andriessen also warnedHills that the Europeans would challenge the new trade law beforeGATT if Washington put the community on the upcoming trade hit list.   That possibility could put the United States in the embarrassingposition of having an international tribunal declare the keysection of the new trade law in violation of global trading rules.   GATT, a global trade charter signed by 96 nations, serves as theinternational trade agency that tries to resolve trade disputes.</TEXT></DOC>
