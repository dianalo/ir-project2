LyonsandM;and Diane BernardandM;Just when you thought IBM and Microsoft Corp. had their act together onsystems software, a new rift that has been brewing for months is now comingto a boil.andM;This time it's over font technology, an arcane and once largely ignored partof Presentation Manager.andM;IBM plans to use font technology from Adobe Systems Inc. in its version ofPresentation Manager, according to an IBM official and developers who havebeen briefed by IBM.andM;This diverges from Microsoft's plans to use a font format called Royal, whichit licensed from Apple Computer Inc., in its version of Presentation Manager.andM;An IBM official, who asked not to be named, said IBM will be announcing itsfont decision any day now.andP;  &quot;We're close to making a decision, and we'releaning toward Adobe,&quot; he said.andM;Even if it chooses Adobe, IBM has promised it will support Royal fonts, too,through what it calls an intelligent font interface that would let users pluga variety of font formats into Presentation Manager.andM;&quot;IBM told us recently they're going to use Adobe fonts, plus support Royalfonts,&quot; said Paul Grayson, president of Micrografx Inc., a Richardson, Texas,software developer.andM;Conversely, users of Microsoft's Presentation Manager will be able to useAdobe fonts when Adobe ships a forthcoming version of Adobe Type Manager.andO;Microsoft officials canceled a Jan.andP;  30 press briefing in which they were toaddress this issue.andP;  They were not available for comment last week.andM;But even if Microsoft's Presentation Manager is able to support Adobe fonts,the problem is that IBM's and Microsoft's versions of Presentation Managerwill each have a different standard font format.andP;  Because of this, users whowant to share documents among IBM machines and clones will have to decidewhich font format they want to use, then buy that font and plug it into theirsystems.andM;Users say they would rather not have to worry about fonts.andM;&quot;From a user's perspective, it would be nice if we didn't have all thesedecisions to make all the time,&quot; said Judith Gordon, office-automationmanager with accounting firm Deloitte andamp; Touche, based in Wilton, Conn.andM;Gordon oversees a mix of 1,500 IBM and non-IBM PCs.andP;  &quot;In terms of bringingtogether the Microsoft world and the IBM world, this is going to continue topose problems for us,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;I can't say which font they should go to.andO;I just wish they'd go with one or another.&quot;andM;Even IBM officials concede it's a problem to have Microsoft and IBM offeringseveral font formats.andP;  &quot;In an ideal world there would only be one.andP;  That'snot the world we're living in,&quot; said Colin Powell, technical planning managerof Presentation Manager at IBM's Hursley laboratories in England.andM;The problem began last September, when Microsoft licensed Royal from Appleand said it would use the technology in Presentation Manager, a move thatinsiders say Microsoft made without IBM's blessing.andM;Microsoft chose Royal because it didn't want to pay Adobe's royalty fees,observers said.andM;Powell acknowledged that using Adobe would be more expensive than usingRoyal, but said Adobe had in its favor the fact that it has an installed basewhile Royal is new technology.andM;&quot;IBM's problem is, we have to deal with not just the PC world, but with thelarger SAA world and the AIX world,&quot; Powell said.andP;  Adobe technology isalready used in the Systems Application Architecture and AIX environments.andM;Last fall at the Comdex trade show, IBM and Microsoft made an effort to showthey had reconciled their differences over Presentation Manager and wereworking closely together.andP;  But expecting IBM and Microsoft to walk arm in armis &quot;probably naive,&quot; Powell said.andP;  &quot;We're not the same company.&quot;andM;The future may hold further problems, because IBM is considering takingconcepts from NextStep, the interface it licensed for AIX from Steven Jobs'NeXT Inc., and using them in Presentation Manager, Powell said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
