Tanks, armored personnel carriers and soldiers patrolled thestreets of the southern republic's capital, Tbilisi, to enforce aban on public gatherings and an 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, apparently signaling a toughKremlin response to any more outbursts of nationalist feeling,expressed his resolve to oppose ``extremism, anti-Soviet displaysand the destructive actions of adventurist elements.''   Gorbachev's comments at a meeting with Hans-Jochen Vogel, thehead of West Germany's Social Democratic Party, were carried by theSoviet news agency Tass.   Gorbachev said he considered it a ``sacred'' principle thatGeorgians and others should have the right to express theiropinions freely, but said the law set limits on their actions,Hans-Vogel reported after the meeting.   ``The question of state power is nothing to be trifled with ortaken lightly,'' Vogel quoted Gorbachev as saying.   Reports indicated a general strike that began Friday to backdemands for Georgia's secession was easing. Some buses and trolleysresumed routes Tuesday, and police who accompanied the vehicles ontheir rounds were beaten, Tass said. It said many schools alsoremained closed by boycotts.   Tuesday was declared a day of mourning to mark what the GeorgianCommunist Party leader, Djhumber Patiashvili, called ``a commongrief'' _ the deaths of civilians killed in a clash Sunday withsoldiers and police at the pro-independence demonstration.   Cars and trolleys were adorned with black flags and people woreblack clothes and ribbons, said Nana Natadze, wife of a Georgiannationalist activist.   ``Everything is black,'' she said in a telephone interview fromthe city of 1.2 million people, 900 miles south of Moscow.``Everyone's suffering.''   Georgian radio and TV canceled regular programs to play dirgesand report news, said Nanuli Gogua, another Tbilisi resident whosedaughter, Irina Sarishvili, was among a half-dozen Georgianactivists arrested over the weekend.   All entertainment activities were called off, Tass reported.   About 200 people were arrested for violating the curfew, andpolice were confiscating 66,000 registered hunting rifles from thepublic temporarily, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.Gerasimov told reporters Tuesday, without giving a reason.   The government daily Izvestia said 464 people were arrested forcurfew violations.   Dr. David Lazarishvili, an anesthesiologist at the CentralRepublican Hospital in Tbilisi, said a 32-year-old man died Tuesdaymorning of injuries suffered in Sunday's clash. He said thatbrought the death toll from the confrontation to at least 19,although he said he heard unconfirmed reports of as many as 50deaths.   Gerasimov said at a news briefing Tuesday his latest informationput the death toll at 18, and 120 civilians and 75 police andsoldiers injured. Tass said more than 200 were hurt.   The Foreign Ministry spokesman said one woman died of``traumatic shock'' and 12 people were crushed to death. He saidthe causes of the other deaths were undetermined.   In a report on the TV news program Vremya, Patiashvili said noone expected fatalities when troops armed with clubs and shieldswere ordered to clear demonstrators from Tbilisi's main street.   ``After the troops started to act, they (the demonstrators)didn't retreat. And then the unpredictable happened,'' he said.``The troops didn't back off, and unfortunately, innocent peoplewho were not active participants in the demonstration died.''   ``Unfortunately,'' he added, ``the leaders immediately fled, andnot one of them was scratched.''   ``It happened, and we share a common grief,'' the Georgian partyleader said.   Gerasimov said all factories were working but some not at fullcapacity because ``some women decided to stay home with theirchildren.'' Public transport, he said, was operating at ``almostnormal levels.''   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, an ethnic Georgian, wassent to his home republic to help quell the unrest.   The foreign minister met with a crowd on a street and had a``heated but at the same time substantive dialogue,'' Gerasimovsaid without elaborating.   While serving as Georgian party chief from 1972-1985,Shevardnadze called for tolerance between Georgians and ethnicAbkhazians, a minority living in the western part of the republic.In 1978, he supported nationalists on a law making Georgian therepublic's official language.   Demontrations in the southern province, where former Sovietleader Josef Stalin was born, began April 4. Protesters hadattacked calls from some Abkhazians to break away from the republicbecause of alleged discrimination by Georgians. Others demandedthat Georgia secede from the Soviet Union because of allegedinterference by the central government in their political, economicand cultural affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
