RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to review alaw requiring people convicted of federal crimes to pay money tohelp crime victims.   The court said it will study a ruling that the law isunconstitutional because it is a revenue-raising measure thatoriginated in the U.S. Senate rather than the House ofRepresentatives. The Constitution requires that revenue-raisingmeasures start in the House.   The Bush administration is seeking to have the appeals courtruling reversed.   The case stems from a $50 ``assessment'' against GermanMunoz-Flores, convicted of helping an illegal alien evadeinspection by immigration officials in San Diego County, Calif.Munoz-Flores also was placed on probation for two years.   The assessment was ordered under a 1984 law aimed at raisingmoney to offset the cost of helping victims of crimes.   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last December thatthe law is a revenue-raising measure that should have originated inthe House rather than the Senate.   The appeals court's ruling is binding in Arizona, Alaska,California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.   Justice Department lawyers said the ruling invalidatesassessments imposed against thousands of people convicted in thosestates. The government's appeal said that the 9th Circuit's ruling,if adopted nationwide, would affect tens of thousands of criminalcases each year.   Government lawyers argued that the 1984 law is not primarilydesigned to raise revenue, but rather was part of a package to helpcrime victims. The lawyers also said the assessments measure isdesigned in part to punish those convicted of crimes.   The appeal said the appeals court was mistaken in describing themeasure as originating in the Senate because it actually originatedin the House, which passed a crime-control bill that included theassessments feature.   The law calls for assessments ranging from $25 to $200 peroffense.   The case is U.S. vs. Munoz-Flores, 88-1932.</TEXT></DOC>
