Countries set aside self-interest and reached across traditionaldivides to tackle a common threat.   They agreed to ban a range of chemicals that are depleting theozone layer and set up a $240 million international fund throughwhich industrialized nations can help developing countries adoptenvironmentally safer technology.   Friday's agreement substantially toughened the 1987 MontrealProtocol, a treaty signed by the 56 countries to protect the ozonelayer.   But the two-week conference, attended by 100 nations, alsorevealed traditional conflicts between rich and poor countries andenvironmentalists and business executives that have far-reachingimplications.   The conference was widely viewed as a prelude to talks on thefar more complex and expensive issue of global warming.   The conference ``set the tone not only for how we are to goabout a climate change convention but also how difficult it isgoing to be,'' said Dr. Mostafa Tolba, the Egyptian who heads theU.N. Environment Program.   ``We tried to strike a balance between what scientists say isgoing to happen if we don't save the ozone and what is politicallyand financially feasible,'' he said.   At the conference at least a dozen countries, including most ofthe European Community, the Nordic countries, Australia, NewZealand and Canada, thought swifter action was feasible andnecessary.   These nations advocated a ban effective in 1997 on chemicalscalled chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that erode the ozone layer, whichshields the planet from harmful ultraviolet rays.   The United States, Japan and the Soviet Union insisted onsetting the target date for the year 2000. The United States arguedthat industry needs the additional time to test alternativechemicals before introducing them as replacements forchlorofluorocarbons.   Environmentalists said the extra three years would mean 11billion tons of additional CFCs pumped into the stratosphere.   ``Industry defeated science, the environment and common sense,''said Paul Hohnen, a Greenpeace spokesman.   CFCs, used in refrigeration, insulation, cleaning solvents andas aerosol propellents, rise into the stratosphere where they breakdown in constituent chemical parts. One of these, chlorine,destroys the thin shield of ozone, which helps preserve the Earth'sflora and protects humans from developing skin cancer.   Another compromise was reached at the conference betweendeveloping nations and underdeveloped countries on the transfer oftechnology.   Chemical company officials met with Indian Environment MinisterManeka Gandhi and agreed to make available technologies to produceCFC substitutes.   Gandhi, speaking for developing nations, had demanded assurancesthat Third World countries would have access to advancedtechnologies.   ``Very often in the Third World we have come across thisproblem,'' Ms. Gandhi said. ``They tell us we have no access to thetechnology, only the finished product. We become clients on a verylarge scale.''   India and China have flourishing chlorofluorocarbon plants,burgeoning populations and a growing demand for the chemical. Theconference thus set up an ozone fund to coax such countries intosigning the treaty by helping them build industries that do notrely on ozone-depleting chemicals.   China and India will receive $40 million from the fund over thenext three years after signing the protocol, which they have saidthey will do.</TEXT></DOC>
