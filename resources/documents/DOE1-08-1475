<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-08-1475 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two new methods for monitoring hydrogen content in steels at ambient andelevated temperatures by using an electrochemical permeation method areproposed. One method is to monitor hydrogen content in pipe line continuouslyby using a nickel-plating method. This probe is based on the formationof NiOOH which contains mobile hydrogen. The field test was performedwith high reliability over three months. The detection limit of thishydrogen probe is less than 0.01 ppm as a hydrogen content. The secondis to measure hydrogen content in steels at elevated temperatures (673-773K) in the range of practical interest for hydrogen attack. Molten sodiumhydroxide as an electrolyte and a stabilized zirconia reference electrodeare used. The detection limit is quite enough to monitor hydrogen attackin steels.</TEXT></DOC>
