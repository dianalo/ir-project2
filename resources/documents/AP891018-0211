Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Party President Ricardo Arias Calderon said Raul Ossa ``wassubmitted to cruel physical and psychological torture'' after beingarrested Oct. 3. Ossa was held for six days in La Chorrera jail inthe western part of the city.   Military rebels tried unsuccessfully on Oct. 3 to oust Noriega,who as head of the Defense Forces also controls the government.   Arias Calderon said Ossa ``could see five members of the partymanacled to a water pipe and was told he also would be so theywould be the first to fall when the gringo invaders took thebarracks.''   ``On more than one occasion they put a gun to his temple,'' hesaid. ``For 11 hours he was blindfolded with gauze, left standingup, interrogated and beaten hard in the stomach.''   Guards took turns to keep Ossa from sleeping, Arias Calderonreported.   The party said it was creating a special human rights commissionto be headed by Ossa that will denounce violations of its members'rights, assist victims and relatives, and educate the public.   Arias Calderon said the Oct. 3 rebels ``were interrogated abouta supposed link between the Christian Democratic Party and anAmerican invasion.''   The U.S. government has been using economic and politicalpressure trying to force Noriega out after he was indicted on U.S.drug trafficking charges in February 1988.   Noriega denies the charges and says the campaign against him ispart of a U.S. effort to avoid giving up the Panama Canal at theend of 1999 under the 1977 canal treaties.   Arias Calderon said the Christian Democrats' publicity directorwas arrested on Sept. 28, accused of attacking the state, but hasnot been mistreated.   Five other party members were jailed on Oct. 2 for carryingposters bearing slogans including those demanding Arias Calderon'sfreedom when he was briefly under arrest.   Arias Calderon said an arrest warrant is out for party officialRamon Aizpurua, now abroad, on charges of financing an armedmovement aimed at overthrowing the government.</TEXT></DOC>
