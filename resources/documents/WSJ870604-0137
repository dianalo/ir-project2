Energy Development, an oil and gas concern based in Los Angeles, will assume about $3 million in liabilities associated with the wells.    The acquisition will include interests in eight limited partnerships managed by Dallas-based May. Quinoco Energy Inc., the Denver-based general partner of Energy Development, will participate in the acquisition. Quinoco is a unit of Angeles Corp., a Los Angeles investment management company.    The transaction is subject to approval by May shareholders.    As previously reported, May solicited bids for the properties, which included estimated proven reserves of about 600,000 barrels of oil and 34 billion cubic feet of gas, in order to concentrate its efforts on oil exploration. The company has retained its unexplored acreage.    Energy Development said the acquisition will increase its proven reserves 25%. In an earlier transaction, Energy Partners acquired the net assets of May Energy Partners Ltd., an oil and gas limited partnership managed by May.    May Petroleum is 44% controlled by Craig Hall, the Dallas real estate investor who serves as its chairman and chief executive officer. </TEXT></DOC>
