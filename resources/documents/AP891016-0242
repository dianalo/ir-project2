Investors were not reassured by a relatively calm response inTokyo earlier in the day.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index opened 157.1points, or 6.8 percent, lower at 2,076.8.   Friday afternoon's setback on Wall Street occurred long afterthe London market had closed for the weekend, and some Britishanalysts had been predicting an instant drop of up to 6 percent inthe key London index.   But in unofficial trading before the exchange did open, sharessank even lower, with the key London index estimated to be 200points down at one point. The bargain hunters entered the market,and prices recovered somewhat.   Dealers are allowed to trade stocks outside exchange hours.   ``The market is looking for a level which it is comfortableholding,'' said Charles Larkum, an equity analyst at the Londoninvestment firm James Capel and Co.   The dollar, meanwhile, sank in Europe this morning. The poundwas quoted at $1.5865 compared with $1.5625 late Friday. The dollaralso was quoted at 1.8490 West German marks and 140.91 Japaneseyen, compared with 1.9025 marks and 144 yen late Friday.   Earlier in Tokyo, where trading ends before London dealingsbegin, the Nikkei Stock Average fell 647.33 points, or 1.8 percent,to close at 34,468.69.   London market makers moved prices sharply lower in an effort toprotect themselves from any flood of sell orders, which in turnprompted a heavy outbreak of selling pressure, dealers said.   ``It's havoc at the moment but we expect the market to stabilizeat lower levels ahead of the New York opening later Monday,'' saidRichard Dingwall-Smith, an economist at the London investment firmCounty Natwest WoodMac Securities.   Michael Hughes, an economist with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.,said the apparent determination of governments to prevent a1987-style crash ``gives underlying support for the market, so Iwouldn't get overexcited'' about the danger of a full crash.   ``I think they have a vested interest in making sure that '87doesn't repeat itself and indeed they have the experience of '87 todraw on,'' he told British Broadcasting Co. televisionoin. ``Ithink it's particularly salutary that the American authorities doseem prepared to cut interest rates, and that might help here.''   Analysts said the London market was concerned that a fresh burstof computer-driven selling on New York later Monday could drag themarket sharply lower. Stock Exchange Chairman Andrew Hugh Smithsaid this morning: ``I certainly do not think there is any reasonto panic.''   The Securities Association, which governs the Stock Exchange,held a precautionary meeting in London to assess the Far Eastresponse to the slump in New York.   Some stockbrokers stayed in central London hotels overnight tobe at their screens early this morning.   The Bank of England said Saturday it saw ``no reason for such anexaggerated fall in London share values.''   Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 190 points inthe final hour of trading Friday with a loss of nearly $200 billionin paper wealth. The plunge occurred exactly two years after a108-point Dow drop presaged the Oct. 19, 1987 Black Monday crash ofa record 508 points.   The U.S. Federal Reserve was reported ready to move largeamounts of cash into the American banking system if money is neededto prevent a financial crisis.   But that is not seen as an option for Britain, because ofinflation. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson last weekraised base lending rates to an eight-year high of 15 percent tocontrol inflation running at 7.6 percent.   British shares had been on the slide for three weeks, amid gloomabout inflation, interest rates and the overall state of theeconomy.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10 Downing St. office issuedno statements on the stock market situation over the weekend. Nordid Chancellor Lawson.</TEXT></DOC>
