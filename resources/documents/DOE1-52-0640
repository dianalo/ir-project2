In Alzheimer's disease, for instance, intracellularsites of Al accumulation are the neurofibrillary tangles in the nucleiof brain cells, and the senile plaques where it is found in the formof aluminosilicates. The roles played by Al in each of the above conditionsis usually poorly defined, if there is even general agreement upon itsinvolvement at all. The relevant coordination chemistry has only recentlybecome of concern to inorganic chemists, and this often involves thestudy of the various Al species formed in aqueous solution with a ligandof some environmental, agricultural, or nutritional importance. Theirapproach has been to prepare Al-ligand complexes which are neutral butalso sufficiently water soluble to allow a reasonable in vivo concentrationto be attained.</TEXT></DOC>
