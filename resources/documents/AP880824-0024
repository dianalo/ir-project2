The required placement of three federal judges on theseven-member sentencing commission violated the constitutionalseparation of powers and also interfered with the appearance ofjudicial impartiality by allowing the president to appoint andremove members, said the opinion by Judge Alex Kozinski.   The guidelines, which took effect last November, recommendminimum and maximum sentences for each crime, and require the judgeto state unusual circumstances for imposing a sentence outside therange.   Federal judges throughout the nation have issued scores ofconflicting rulings on constitutional challenges to the guidelines,mostly based on the same separation-of-powers issue.   The 9th Circuit, which covers nine Western states, Guam and theNorthern Marianas, is the first appeals court to rule on thevalidity of the guidelines. While the ruling has effect only in theregion, it can influence other circuit courts, but the issue islikely to be decided ultimately by the U.S. Supreme Court.   The chairman of Sentencing Commission, Judge William Wilkins ofthe 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., saidTuesday night in Washington on the Larry King radio talk show thathe was disappointed with the ruling.   But Wilkins added, ``We'll be having a definitive and finalanswer from the United States Supreme Court real soon.'' He notedthat the court has scheduled arguments on the issue Oct. 5 on acase that originated in Missouri.   The guidelines were challenged by public defenders, who wereunhappy with provisions that lengthened sentences for many crimesand restricted judges' authority.   ``We're very happy with the guidelines being thrown out,'' saidGeoff Hansen, an assistant federal public defender in SanFrancisco. ``We're just ecstatic that we don't have to deal withthis nightmare any more.''   But he said lawyers will be ``in some state of uncertainty'' indealing with a number of recent cases, including some in which theguidelines helped individual defendants and others involving pleabargains based on the guidelines.   The challenges, in two consolidated cases from San Diego, woundup before an appellate panel that consisted of three appointees ofPresident Reagan. Kozinski's opinion was joined by Judge MelvinBrunetti; Judge Charles Wiggins dissented.   Kozinski said the commission violated the constitutional limiton the role of the judiciary because ``its function is politicaland not judicial in nature.''   He said the commission's detailed rules on sentences for eachcrime invade the executive and legislative policy-making roles innumerous ways: for example, it decided that sentences forwhite-collar crimes were too short, cut back sharply on theavailability of probation and decided that all defendants exceptthe poorest must pay fines.   Wiggins, in dissent, said judges' participation in a commissionthat drafted sentencing guidelines did not overstep the boundariesof the judicial role or tarnish judicial impartiality. He saidCongress had set overall sentencing policies and could properlyleave their implementation to a commission that included judges.   Kozinski, however, also said presidential appointment andremoval of commission members created ``a continuous and fairlysignificant entanglement between the judicial and executivebranches of government'' and interfered with the ``aura of judicialimpartiality.''   ``While we are confident that no federal judge would be swayedby such considerations, the tens of thousands of persons wholitigate against the government in civil and criminal cases maylegitimately be apprehensive about the fact that the president isable to dispense plums among the federal judges who will decidetheir cases,'' Kozinski said.   Although judges throughout U.S. history have acceptedappointments on non-judicial commissions, Kozinski said any lawrequiring a judge to serve on a commission that made politicaldecisions was unconstitutional.</TEXT></DOC>
