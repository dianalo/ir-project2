Khartoum itself began returning to normal earlier in the dayafter the anti-government strikes and street violence crippledcommunications, hampered sea and air travel and virtually paralyzedkey cities.   The strikes ended after the financially strapped governmentagreed to roll back huge price increases that went into effect onMonday.   Up to four people died and 26 were wounded during the four daysof demonstrations and strikes, Western military and diplomaticsources said.   As Khartoum's dusty streets slowly returned to normal, signs ofthe turmoil remained _ glass shards from smashed car windows, piecesof cement blocks and blackened remains of burned tires.   Leaders of Saturday's opposition rally, which also marked the eveof the anniversary of national independence in 1956, said the strifestemmed from the people's desire for peace, not just fromdissatisfaction over the econony.   ``It is not just the issue of raising the price of sugar thatmade the people take to the streets; the issue is peace, theSudanese people came to the streets to demand peace, and withoutpeace there can be no Sudan,'' Amin Okasha Mohamed, a member of theDemocratic Unionist Party told The Associated Press.   He said his party would join several other groups, includingCommunists and southern-based parties, to push for peace in thenation's civil war.   Some members of the rally demanded a national reconcilationgovernment to bring together squabbling factions. Some called forearly parliamentary elections, now scheduled for April 1990.   The 2 million-member Sudanese Workers' Trade Union Federation,which had called the general strike last week, ordered the return towork late Friday because of the government's backdown on priceincreases.   The federation had demanded revocation of commodity priceincreases of up to 500 percent and a 15 percent across-the-boardsales tax. It also wanted salary increases of 50 percent to 300percent, decreed a week ago for all public and private employees, tobe made retroactive to July 1 instead of Dec. 1.   In an emergency session on Thursday, Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi'sCabinet met the two requests.   But the demonstrations and strike evolved into protests overSudan's civil war. Demonstrators protested Mahdi's failure toofficially endorse a tentative peace accord the Democratic UnionistParty, a junior partner in his coalition Cabinet, signed withsouthern rebels on Nov. 16.   The agreement called for a peace conference to be convened onDec. 31, with an immediate cease-fire in the 5 {-year-old war andsuspension of Islamic law, which the Christian and animist rebelsoppose.   The prime minister refused to bring the accord before the Cabinetor Parliament, fearing it would lead another coalition partner, thefundamentalist National Islamic Front, to quit the government. TheFront opposes tampering with Islamic law.   The Democratic Unionists, second-largest Cabinet andparliamentary party after Mahdi's Umma, pulled out of the Cabinet onWednesday, protesting the premier's price and peace policies.   Mahdi held consultations on Saturday to form a new coalitiongovernment with the Islamic Front.   Government sources speaking on condition of anonymity said a newgovernment is expected to be announced on Tuesday. They said Mahdiwill also ask for a parliamentary vote of confidence on Wednesday.   Mahdi left Khartoum on Saturday for Obeid in southwestern Sudanin an attempt to ensure the people that the situation was undercontrol, the government sources said.   From Obeid, he will address the nation Sunday morning for theindependence anniversary, the sources said.   Western diplomats and military sources said demonstrators onThursday broke into Mahdi's office compound, smashing parkedgovernment cars and writing anti-government slogans on the walls.The demonstrators demanded that the prime minister, who was inside,come out and talk to them, but he refused.   Electricity, water and air and land transportation services weredown during the general strike. Markets were empty, and bread andvegetables disappeared. Both state television and radio were off theair, and telephone communications were cut.   In addition to Khartoum, rioting and the general strike hit otherprovincial centers including Port Sudan, Gedaref, Kassala, WadMedani and Atbara.</TEXT></DOC>
