says Tom Wood, a seniorindustry analyst at BRG.andP;  The challenges of managing local networks, remotenetworks, and their interconnection is complicated by the lack of globalnetwork management software.andP;  &quot;More robust LAN management tools are needed,&quot;Wood says.andM;LAN managers also increasingly function as part of MIS.andP;  &quot;Although PCs wereonce seen as the nemesis of MIS, they are now part of the strategicinformation technology direction of many companies.andP;  MIS is committed tointegrating PC LANs into the enterprise system,&quot; state the authors of &quot;PC LANintegration and Management: User Trends.&quot;andM;This BRG report is based on telephone interviews with more than 400respondents who have LAN administration responsibilities and work in siteswith more than 1,000 employees.andP;  Each site surveyed has an average of 18 LANsand 27 servers, with an average of eight people administering the LANs.andP;  Theaverage site has 47 percent of its personal computers networked, with anaverage of 17 PCs per server.andM;Fully 43 percent of the surveyed sites have Ethernet networks, and 41 percenthave Token Ring.andP;  Forty eight percent of the sites use Novell NetWare, 8.8percent use IBM PC LAN Program, 7.8 percent have IBM LAN Server, 6.5 percenthave Banyan VINES, 6.1 percent use Digital Equipment DECnet/PathWorks, 5.9percent use Microsoft or 3Com LAN Manager, and 5.5 percent Talk or AFP.andM;CHANGING ROLEandM;The LAN administrator's changing role stems from fundamental changes inorganizations' information infrastructures and the way they view networks.andO;&quot;Most organizations are changing the way they use their informationtechnology,&quot; Wood says.andP;  &quot;To become more competitive with the systems theyalready have, they're starting to link them together.&quot;andM;Integrating different technologies from different vendors requires a lot ofwork, and the tools to build multivendor, multiprotocol networks often stillare missing.andP;  Lack of knowledge is yet another stumbling block for LANadministrators.andM;&quot;The internetworking market is in a rage of growth and confusion,&quot; BRG says.andO;&quot;Users are rapidly internetworking their LANs, but they are, by their ownadmission, lacking the expertise to do the job effectively.andP;  Ninety-threepercent of our respondents agreed that internetworking is a very importanttask of their IS strategy, and 35 percent said lack of expertise was one oftheir biggest obstacles.&quot;andM;But while the LAN manger's job is becoming more difficult, it's alsoincreasingly important as the network plays a more strategic role inbusiness-line applications.andM;The shift from running mission-critical applications on mainframes to PC LANshas elevated the influence of PC users and subsequently LAN administrators.andO;&quot;Because of that shift from terminals to PCS, the people who reside betweenthe data and the PC-the LAN administrators-andlsqb;have] an increasingly importantjob,&quot; Wood says.andP;  &quot;The LAN administrator is the gateway to the PC user, andthe PC is the user's window to information technology.andP;  This makes the PCuser a critical user.andP;  Fewer and fewer users have terminals; now they havePCs.andP;  They're accessing critical applications through LANs andinternetworking devices.&quot;andM;RELATIONSHIP TO MISandM;LAN administrators' cooperation with MIS is key to integrating PC LANs intothe enterprise networking system.andP;  Fully 57.4 percent of the LANadministrators surveyed report to MIS, and 57.3 percent report to non-MISpersonnel (see Figure 1).andP;  Respondents defined MIS as the centralorganization in charge of managing nondepartmental information technology.andM;Although most LAN managers have one official boss, 24 percent report to bothMIS and another group.andP;  The LAN administrators who report to both adepartment and MIS are in a more complex position in managing the LAN.andP;  Theyhave to balance what the department wants and what MIS can provide,&quot; Woodsays.andM;Of the LAN administrators who report to non-MIS personnel, 28.2 percentreport to a non-MIS department head, 22.7 percent report to a workgroupmanager, 5.2 percent answer to themselves, and 1.2 percent checked in withother non-MIS personnel.andP;  In most cases, these LAN administrators work indivisions that need LAN support that the central MIS group does not provide.andO;These LAN managers often act as a liaison between MIS and departments, a rolethat can be productive or frustrating, depending on the organization'scomputing philosophy.andM;&quot;The LAN administrator is put in the delicate position between MIS and theend user in many companies,&quot; the report states.andP;  &quot;Issues, such as companystandards vs.andP;  freedom of choice and security vs.andP;  access to data, are at theheart of the LAN administrator's responsibilities.&quot;andM;Wood says, &quot;In organizations where the LAN administrator is not part of MIS,there is misunderstanding in many cases, because MIS isn't aware of the needsof the department, and the LAN administrator is more closely in touch withthose needs, for example, application development or data backup.andM;&quot;It's well set up in some organizations.andP;  These LAN managers act as a bufferbetween MIS and the department.andP;  They explain MIS to the department, and thedepartment tells them their needs.&quot;andM;Companies in which MIS manages LANs tend to have centralized controls andcorporate standards.andP;  These LAN administrators tend to get more support fromMIS staff, but they adhere to MIS's standards to get that support.andP;  &quot;When theLAN administrator is strictly MIS [with a mainframe-centric background], theconnection with the end user was less,&quot; Wood says.andP;  &quot;The user issues wereless clear, but the technology issues were more clear.&quot;andM;WHO DOES WHATandM;Of the network administrators surveyed, 79 percent receive support from theircompanies' MIS departments (see Figure 2).andM;&quot;As the task of managing LANs has become quite complex in many companies, arenewed reliance on MIS has begun,&quot; the BRG report states.andP;  &quot;MIS hasdeveloped the skills necessary for managing equipment and information, andalthough these assets are now decentralized, the control of them is becomingcentralized.&quot;andM;Nearly three-quarters of the respondents agreed that department managersshould control PC LAN applications, but MIS should control other aspects ofPC LANs (see Figure 4).andP;  Thirty-seven percent strongly agreed, 36 percentsomewhat agreed, 16 percent somewhat disagreed, and 10 percent stronglydisagreed.andM;The services that MIS departments provide for PC LANs typically aretraditional MIS services carried over to the LAN environment (see Figure 3).andO;These services include network maintenance (91.1 percent of the sites),network integration (87 percent), capacity planning (82.3 percent), equipmentmaintenance (80.4 percent), and help desks (79.7 percent).andP;  Other servicesinclude security administration (77.5 percent), network cabling andinstallation (76.3 percent), network application administration (73.1percent), server backup (66.1 percent), network application development (62.3percent), and PC data backup (41.8 percent).andM;Most respondents did not indicate a need for additional services from MIS.andO;When they did want help, PC data backup (8.9 percent of the respondents),network application development (8.2 percent), and server backup (7.3percent) were at the top of the list.andP;  LAN administrators also wanted helpwith security administration (6.6 percent), help desks (5.7 percent), andnetwork application administration (5.4 percent).andM;The differences in what MIS does and what LAN managers want demonstrate that&quot;the communication between users and MIS is not always up to speed,&quot; Woodsays.andP;  &quot;If companies want to become more competitive, then MIS needs to startlistening to their end users.andP;  As long as communication is open, you'd expectthose differences to come together.andP;  LAN administration and management is allrelatively new.andP;  The real challenge is how will MIS respond to thesedifferences.&quot;andM;CRYING NEED FOR MANAGEMENTandM;Despite the growing complexity of networks, only 37 percent of the surveyedsites use a PC LAN management package (see Figure 5).andP;  This lack ofmanagement tools is an impediment to enterprisewide applications.andP;  &quot;The lackof effective PC LAN management tools is a critical inhibitor tomission-critical applications deployment on LANs,&quot; the BRG report states.andO;Lack of security on LANs is another roadblock.andM;Respondents tended to define a PC LAN management package as an umbrella,enterprisewide management system, such as IBM's NetView, rather than as toolsthat manage specific devices.andM;Many companies do not have the diagnostic devices or the expertise toeffectively manage network hardware.andP;  Only 41 percent of the respondents useprotocol analyzers; about the same percentage use cable activity testers andtracers.andP;  Only 28 percent use time domain reflectometers.andP;  Learning tooperate such diagnostic tools is relatively easy; understanding what theresults mean is not so simple.andM;&quot;The management of LANs is about a generation behind the management of theenterprise [host-based networks], but [LANs] are approaching very quickly thecritical nature of the enterprise [networks],&quot; Wood says.andP;  &quot;LAN managementhas to make that jump to meet the need for critical information running on aLAN and a company running its business on a LAN.andM;&quot;More and more LANs are getting interconnected.andP;  People are running aroundtrying to manage LANs locally instead of remotely from a central console.andP;  Tobe competitive, companies need to cut time of MIS staff and make the LANsmore manageable-that's what points to the need for management software.&quot;andM;Centralized remote management capabilities are particularly important  ascompanies  internetwork geographically dispersed LANs.andP;  &quot;Although only 37percent currently use WANs to connect their LANs, users are committed tointegrating the whole enterprise,&quot; the BRG report states.andM;High-speed transmission connections, such as frame relay and T-3, willexperience the largest growth in the next two years, according to BRG.andM;OUTSIDE HELPandM;In the trend dubbed outsourcing, LAN managers increasingly are going outsidetheir organizations for help in administering and integrating their networks.andM;&quot;PC LAN growing pains are affecting even the most sophisticated ISorganizations,&quot; the BRG report states.andP;  &quot;Finding capable people to design,integrate, and maintain an enterprise of PC LANs is no easy task.andP;  To make upfor this lack of expertise, most companies are looking to outside companiesfor help.&quot;andM;Fully 23.9 percent of respondents first ask their primary LAN vendors forhelp in defining their PC LAN integration requirements; 20.7 percent turn toinhouse support; 20.4 percent to their primary mainframe vendors; 11.2percent to third-party systems integrators; 9.5 percent to software vendors;9.2 percent to VARs; 1.2 percent to public data network vendors; and 0.5percent to voice network companies.andM;&quot;The data people get first stab at helping them with the PC LAN integrationrequirements, especially the PC LAN vendors,&quot; Wood says.andP;  &quot;There's a lack ofknowledge overall, in the entire integration of the system; that's why peopleare going outside.&quot;andM;Managers are also asking for networking solutions geared specifically totheir corporate needs that fit into existing environments.andP;  &quot;It's good newsfor users&quot; and an area of opportunity for vendors, Wood says.andM;TRAININGandM;Although they are looking outside for initial help in designing andinstalling networks, companies are developing expertise inhouse to bettermeet the business needs of their workers.andM;&quot;The LAN administrator's job has changed,&quot; Wood says.andP;  &quot;It's not as easy asit was once.andP;  A LAN administrator has to be a technical person whounderstands the network and users' needs, especially with softwaredevelopment.andP;  Understanding all that takes training.&quot;andM;Fully 64 percent of the surveyed companies provide formal training for theirnetwork manager.andP;  Wood expects this percentage to increase as networks growin complexity and companies invest in inhouse expertise, rather thansubsidize the training of outside firms' personnel, such as systemsintegrators.andM;&quot;A company has to hire someone and train that person, or train who theyhave,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;With PC LANs, nobody has the expertise.andP;  LAN administratorsare not only managing LANs but integrating them with everything else.andO;andlsqb;Companies] are paying systems integrators to learn their networks anddevelop their expertise.&quot;andM;WHAT IT MEANSandM;It's a time of great change and opportunity for LAN managers.andP;  As companiesevaluate the feasibility of moving business-line functions down from themainframe to the PC LAN and consequently weave separate LANs intoenterprisewide networks, the LAN administrator's role and influence is in astate of flux.andM;&quot;The PC LAN administrator has become, in many respects, the MIS manager of aPC LAN with new responsibilities of interacting with other MIS managers' LANsin a way that benefits both the end user and the organization,&quot; the BRGreport states.andP;  &quot;The fundamental changes occurring in information technologyare drastically changing the role and responsibilities of the LANadministrator.&quot;andM;LAN administrators are dealing with their new roles in different ways.andO;&quot;There is no one right answer.andP;  It depends on the organization,&quot; Wood says.andO;He predicts that bow companies integrate their PC LANs into theirorganizations and what role LAN administrators will play depends on whatcompanies have done during the past 10 years and what they will do over thenext 10 years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
