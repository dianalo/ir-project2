Number of the test wells (1400 m depth) wasfour and various tests were made respectively for the wells to collectthe evaluation data. Verification test on the collection/reinjectionwas carried out with NO.1-NO.2 wells (each roughly 100 m apart) at 20t/h flow rate and No. 4 reinjection well, 1200 m apart, at 60 t/h flowrate. In this test, such phenomena as reduction of the reinjected amountin the initial period, reduction of reinjection temperature, and theincrease of the reinjected amount due to the operation stoppage wereobserved. On the basis of above data and the basic test, a hydrauliccrushing test for the geothermal reservoir was carried out at 60 t/htest. In the test, geothermal water with 68{sup 0}C temperature was usedto heat the river water (2{sup 0}C) 40 t/h up to 55{sup 0}C. (6 figs,4 tabs, 4 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
