(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The slaying of tobacco heiress MargaretBenson by her son should not keep his children from getting a shareof her $10 million estate, a state appeals court ruled.   The 2nd District Court of Appeal on Friday upheld a Circuit Courtdecision guaranteeing an inheritance for the three young children ofSteven Benson.   Both courts rejected arguments that a state law barring killersfrom profiting from the wills of their victims could be applied toBenson's children.   Benson, 38, murdered his mother and his adopted brother ScottBenson and disfigured his sister, Carol Benson Kendall, in July 1985by exploding two pipe bombs in Mrs. Benson's car in the driveway ofthe family's posh Naples home.   Mrs. Benson's will ordered her estate to be equally divided amongher three children. With Scott Benson dead and Steven Bensondisqualified by state law as an heir, his children claimed a halfshare of the estate.   Mrs. Kendall challenged the will, charging the children should beineligible for the inheritance because of their father's crimes.   An added twist to the case was the fact that Scott Benson wasactually Mrs. Kendall's illegitimate son; he had been adopted by hermother, Mrs. Benson. So he was Mrs. Benson's biological grandson butlegally her son and heir and aldo legally a brother of hisbiological mother.   Attorney Marjorie Starnes, who represented the three children'sinterests in the estate, was jubilant about the latest decision.   ``It means the children can now have an education and a securefuture,'' she said. ``I am thrilled beyond description.''   The appeals court said in a seven-page opinion that state lawrestricts inheritances for those who intentionally kill anotherperson, but ``it is the surviving person who kills who is prohibitedfrom benefiting from the act of killing.''   Attorney Bert Pena, who handled Mrs. Kendall's appeal, said hewas disappointed in the outcome. He had not read the opinion andcould not say if the case would be appealed again.   Benson's children are living with their mother, Debra, out ofstate because ``they need to be far away from the stigma'' of thecase, Ms. Starnes said. All three are kindergarten age or younger.   When federal taxes, probate and other costs are deducted, thethree children stand to share about $2 million, said estate executorCarl Westman. The same amount would go to Mrs. Kendall.   Benson was sentenced to two life terms on two counts offirst-degree murder. The prosecution charged he feared being cut outof his mother's will after she became outraged over his heavyspending on drugs and his personal life.   Mrs. Benson was an heiress to the Lancaster Leaf Tobacco Co.fortune of Lancaster, Pa.</TEXT></DOC>
