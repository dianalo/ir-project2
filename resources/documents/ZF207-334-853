DVORAK VS JIM SEYMOURandM;It's easy to get on the standards bandwagon and talk about how important theyare.andP;  After all, if we didn't have standards, you couldn't get a two-by-fourat the lumber store.andP;  There'd be no nuts and bolts with the same threads.andP;  Aninch wouldn't be an inch; there'd be a million different calendars; youwouldn't be able to buy two shoes made the same way!andP;  Heck, nobody would evenspeak the same language.andM;This is all bull.andP;  Specious.andP;  The fact is that standards are a natural resultof a free market.andP;  Standards show up or don't show up as a result offree-market needs and everyday interaction between people and businesses.andO;Simply put, all true standards are natural, not forced.andP;  Jim, what I'm sayingwhen I say that standards aren't important is: the preoccupation withstandards isn't important.andP;  I'm also saying that standards do not come aboutbecause of committees, they evolve naturally.andP;  They always have and theyalways will.andP;  When standards bump into each other with uglyincompatibilities, then technology takes over and makes everythingcompatible.andM;We've all seen this with software such as Media Master, which could be usedto transfer data from the most obscure nonstandard CP/M-formatted diskette toan IBM Pc disk.andP;  More recently we've seen VCRs from Panasonic, Hitachi, andothers that can read any format of videotape, whether recorded in NTSC, PAL,SECAM, or 11 other major video format standards.andP;  In Asia the most used TVreceivers have multistandard capability.andP;  Note the term &quot;multistandard.&quot;andO;This is the joke of so-called standards.andP;  How can there be multistandards?andO;The fact is that it means &quot;no standards.&quot;andM;To prove this, all you have to do is find something you'd call a standardthat came about from anything other than market forces.andP;  It can't be done.andO;My favorite fiasco is the aborted attempt, years ago, by a bunch of dopeyidealists to turn the United states into a country that worshiped the grandmetric standard.andP;  Remember this one?andP;  We were supposed to switch to Celsiusfor our thermometers, kilometers per hour for our cars, and millimeters forour measurements.andP;  This failed attempt to shove a standard down the throatsof a public happy with feet, inches, and miles per hour is a perfect exampleof what happens when the idea of standards is promoted.andP;  It gets nowhere.andM;The problem with standards is that, like respect, you have to command them,not demand them.andP;  When the users of a technology want or need a standard forsome short-term reason, they collectively agree on one, either by buying aproduct that does something a specific &quot;standard&quot; ay, or by cheering for anidea of which they approve.andP;  It's very democratic.andM;Promoters of standards for standards' sake are the people who set up thecommittees.andP;  In computerdom, we find the IEEE, ANSI, and various specialinterest groups that gather to create a standard.andP;  Then they hope to have acrowd of well-wishers in the form of manufacturers.andP;  These rooter say thatthey'll adopt this new standard and use it.andP;  They all know, though, that thepublic at large is the final arbiter.andM;So why do I care about any of this?andP;  It's just that the preoccupation withstandards has done progress more harm than good.andP;  The recent EISA busstandard has actually confused the marketplace because it competes with theMicro Channel standard.andP;  If there weren't such a preoccupation with standardsby pundits such as yourself, Jim, there wouldn't be this confusion.andP;  Peoplespend too much time looking for a dictated solution to their questions.andP;  Theywant the stock answer.andP;  They want what everyone else has: the so-calledstandard.andP;  None of this is healthy.andM;The logical end point of standards means someone will choose the color of theclothes we wear--the standard.andP;  Maybe you like  world without choices, Jim.andO;A world dictated by committees and experts.andP;  A world preoccupied withstandards.andP;  It's not for me.andP;  And I think attempts to steamroll standardsjust go against the grain of a humanity that has argued (sometimes violently)about something such as a &quot;standard&quot; religion for thousands of years.andP;  Heck,if we can't standardize religion, morals, ethics, and conduct within a fewthousand years, then what can we standardize?andP;  Nothing, that's what.andP;  Let'sjust let the free market make the standards, let them come and go, and we canorry about other things.andP;  Standards just aren't important.andM;As usual you've got it right, John--about half-right.andM;Sure, it's true that standards aren't what they once were in the personalcomputer business.andP;  And sure, we no longer feel so bounded by them.andP;  But thatdoesn't mean standards are no longer important--just that their role haschanged.andM;This business has progressed from being a sea of incompatible &quot;standards&quot; tocoalescing around a single, widely understood standard and now to opening uponce agian to embrace several standards.andP;  That's the classic market-growthpattern for technologies, and it's been a healthy process.andM;First we had an explosion o wildly incompatible hardware and software.andO;Nothing ran on anything other than the machine for which it was written, andsoftware developers, computer dealers, and end users alike were forced toplay the murderous game of Standards Roulette: will this one survive?andM;Out of that wilderness came CP/M, around which it was possible to build somesort-of-standard machines.andP;  We still had disk-size and disk-formatincompatibilities, but it began to be possible to shop for software with somehope that hit programs would run on what you had on your desk.andM;So our Kaypros, Morrows, Northstars, Vector Graphics, and other early PCsfinally had some degree of commonality.andP;  CP/M itself became a movingtarget--not the standard it seemed at first, but standard enough to get usgong.andM;At the same time, Apple was selling the venerable Apple II--a standard nowlong obsolete, but once important.andP;  The eventual success of the Apple II washobled by its primitive architecture, but make no mistake--the Apple IItaught a lot of people about the desirability of standards.andM;Then in August 1981 came the IBM PC.andP;  the standardization the first IBM PCand its feeble PC-DOS 1.0 operating system brought to the market wasinevitable--and invaluable.andM;Finally there was a machine from a company certain to endure, running anoperating system likely to endure, for a market that simply exploded.andO;Software developers could write code either to the rules of the operatingsystem or to the BIOS code of the machine itself.andP;  And hardware vendors couldbuild circuit cards for the PC's newly standardized bus, disk drives to fitinto newly standardized drive bays, and video monitors to plug into newlystandardized video cards.andM;Even connectors became standardized (if not rationalized) around DB-25connectors at the PC end and the Centronics 36-pin connector at theparallel-printer end.andM;The PC business flourised, now that it had a single, widely installed, widelyunderstood standard.andP;  Copycat PCs became possible, too, to IBM's regret,thanks to that standardization.andM;The advent of the IBM PC AT in August 1984 continued the trend.andP;  IBM showedit understood the virtues of standardization, delivering a new,higher-performance machine without abandoning the standard already in place.andM;Then came the IBM PS/2s, in April 1987.andP;  They abandoned IBM's PC bus butstill honored the other conventions of the &quot;IBM PC standard.&quot;andM;Some say the PS/2s sounded the death knell for PC standards.andP;  In fact, afundamental shift was already under way in our understanding of the idea ofstandards.andP;  Before the PS/2s appeared, we had the Macintosh and especiallythe Mac II, and we had Sun workstations, the first truly standardized Unixplatforms.andM;And since the PS/2 rollout, we've added the NeXT computer, which bids fair tobecome yet another player in this new, multiple-standards world.andM;That idea of several successful, incompatible but complementary standards iswhat's important now.andP;  By choosing among several different standards--say,PS/2s for office work, Mac IIs for desktop publishing, and Sun 3/60s fortechnical workstations--we can assemble the kind of computing arsenal neededto tackle complex problems.andM;The glue that holds all that together is, of course, the local areanetwork--the final step in making possible this multistandard, multisystemworld.andM;John, we can't and won't revert to those insane days of no standards--orthousands of standards, as everyone made up his own by announcing a newcomputer or operating system.andM;Our new understanding of the role of standards doesn't mean they aren'timportant--just that it takes new thinking to use them wisely.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
