Soviet noncompliance, in conjunctionwith its overall active and passive defense programs, suggests stronglythat the US government was intentionally deceived by Moscow as to itsobjectives in negotiating limits on ABM defenses. This dissertation examinesthe extent to which the Soviet Union employed deception and perceptionsmanagement (Dandamp;PM) to mislead the US about its true intentions with respectto antimissile defenses and the military uses of outer space, duringand after SALT I. An important dimension of this issue is the role andimpact that US self-deception had (reinforced through Dandamp;PM) in formingits perceptions of Soviet intentions in the area of missile defenses,outer space, and the ABM Treaty. Since a main deployment area for anyfuture US-USSR missile defense is in outer space, Soviet arguments againstmilitary uses for outer space are examined.</TEXT></DOC>
