Gigot </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> COLUMBUS, Ohio  </DATELINE><TEXT>    A vignette from what ABC's Sam Donaldson now calls &quot;the Bataan Death March,&quot; also known as the traveling Dukakis campaign:   Michael Dukakis is meeting here with seven families. It's a typical staged event, designed to highlight Mr. Dukakis's proposals to help the middle class. But sometimes even handpicked voters say the damnedest things. Mary Watson, a teacher, agrees that &quot;the middle-class family is sort of getting squeezed,&quot; but adds, &quot;It just seems there must be some kind of tax law to give us a break.&quot;    A tax break? Oops, isn't that a George Bush idea? No matter, the Duke plows ahead, explaining to Mrs. Watson that a tax break would only increase the deficit. (As the pool reporter who recorded the event put it, &quot;I swear I am not making this up.&quot;)    As the polls look bleaker for Michael Dukakis, the most striking impression one gets from spending a few days with his campaign is its sense of disbelief. How can this be happening? Why don't the voters understand the trouble this country is in? Or how he'll get us out of it? Introducing Mr. Dukakis in Boston on Sunday, Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin declares, &quot;We have to wake this country up from a case of selective amnesia.&quot;    But the better question is, Who precisely is the one suffering amnesia? Mr. Dukakis advertises this race as a replay of John F. Kennedy's. &quot;I want to take you back to 1960,&quot; he says at nearly every stop. &quot;Wasn't that a great ticket, a strong ticket?&quot;    Yet he's making his case to a public instructed by the mutation of liberalism during the 1960s and informed by its failures in the 1970s. With what he says and doesn't say on the stump, he's not so much telling voters about the strengths of JFK as he is reminding them how much he and the Democrats have forgotten. Mr. Dukakis's critics say his message is &quot;unfocused,&quot; and they are right in this respect: It is as confused as the liberalism it represents.    The confusion is symbolized by the differences between two former Kennedy speech writers now working for Mr. Dukakis. Theodore Sorensen, the architect of &quot;Ask not . . .&quot; and other soaring John Kennedy lines, recalls an earlier liberalism of civic obligation and popular community goals. Robert Shrum, who wrote Sen. Ted Kennedy's rousing speech at the 1980 Democratic convention, evokes the newer liberalism of special-interest entitlement and class envy.    The young Michael Dukakis was inspired by the party of Jack, but built his career in the party of Teddy. And this year he has borrowed some of Mr. Sorensen's lines, but more of Mr. Shrum's message.    Mr. Dukakis says &quot;we can do better.&quot; But at a factory outside Cleveland, he complains of an America &quot;sold off every day at bargain-basement prices.&quot; He says &quot;the best America is yet to come,&quot; but in Detroit he visits the same steel plant that Rep. Richard Gephardt used as a backdrop for his protectionist message in the primaries. He says he &quot;believes in the spirit of America,&quot; but in Kalamazoo claims &quot;George Bush cares about the people on Easy Street. I care about the people on Main Street. He's on their side. I'm on your side.&quot; Mr. Dukakis can't decide whether to speak for aspiration or resentment.    And while he attacks like a lion, he proposes like a mouse. His proposal for college education is a loan-repayment plan that even Milton Friedman might endorse. His housing plan is the kind of tax-free savings scheme typical of Republicans. Few of his proposals are irresponsible, but their very limits illustrate his conundrum. If the problems caused by Reaganism are so awful, why are his solutions so puny?    Gov. Dukakis's aides maintain an admirable public optimism, but in private moments one can detect a creeping dismay. To a person, they attribute their slide in the polls not to any failure in their message but to Mr. Bush's &quot;lies&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; campaign. &quot;All of our stuff shows,&quot; says field director Charlie Baker, &quot;that if we get our message out, we win.&quot;    But what message is that? The message that &quot;the trade deficit has cost five million jobs,&quot; though unemployment is at a 14-year low? The message that foreign policy can be addressed in little more than three days of speeches? The message that prison furloughs, the ACLU, the death penalty and the Pledge are too trivial for a presidential campaign?    In a revealing interview, Mr. Dukakis recently told the New York Times that Mr. Bush was intellectually &quot;bankrupt&quot; and his campaign &quot;disgraceful.&quot; It revealed how unreflective Mr. Dukakis is about the transformation of his own guiding philosophy. He wanted to run on &quot;competence,&quot; but is discovering that ideology still matters, especially his.    Say this for Mr. Dukakis, though: Unlike our great liberal journalists, he at least blames Mr. Bush rather than the voters. Richard Cohen, Michael Kinsley, Anthony Lewis, Haynes Johnson, Howard Fineman and James Reston have all in one way or another attributed Mr. Dukakis's campaign troubles not to a rejected message, but to gullible American voters. They agree with Mrs. Kunin that America has to &quot;wake up.&quot; Certainly someone needs to wake up, but it isn't the voters. </TEXT></DOC>
