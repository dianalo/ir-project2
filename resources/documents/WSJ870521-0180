DorfmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN><TEXT>   While most people are looking forward to the Memorial Day weekend, some stock-market investors may be more eagerly anticipating the day before: If history is a valid guide, there's a 75% chance that the market will rise Friday.    Stock prices tend to climb on the last trading day before most holidays or holiday weekends, a quirk long noted by traders and mystifying to market observers. Now, a study by Robert Ariel, a member of the finance faculty at Bernard M. Baruch College, part of the City University of New York, has put the stamp of statistical validity on this phenomenon.    In an analysis of 1963-82 market data, Mr. Ariel found that stock prices typically rose 0.36% in pre-holiday trading. That's 14 times greater than the average gain of 0.026% for all other trading days.    What's more, he figures that 35% of the entire gain in the stock market over the past 20 years, taking into account compounding, occurred on the 160 pre-holiday sessions, although those sessions totaled only 3.2% of all trading days.    Indeed, the pattern has gone on much longer than 20 years. Arthur Merrill, the head of Merrill Analysis Inc. in Chappaqua, N.Y., discussed the pre-holiday bounce in his 1966 book &quot;Behavior of Prices on Wall Street.&quot; Examining stock prices all the way back to 1897, Mr. Merrill looked at how often the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on the trading day that precedes each of the eight annual holidays.    At the request of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Merrill updated his tabulation to the present. The results are shown, holiday by holiday, in the accompanying chart. For the eight annual holidays, the index rose an average of 67.9% of the time. By contrast, only 52.5% of all trading days were &quot;up&quot; days.    No one has a firm explanation for the pattern. Dennis Jarrett, a technical analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., suggests it may stem simply from holiday euphoria. Before a holiday, &quot;you feel a little bit better, snappier,&quot; he says, which may give the stock market &quot;a little firmer tone.&quot;    Most traders deny that they buy just before a holiday weekend. &quot;Why would I load up on stock on a Thursday before a long weekend?&quot; asks Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research for Gruntal andamp; Co. &quot;I want to protect myself from any untoward event that may happen.&quot;    Perhaps covering by short sellers-who don't want to hold short positions through a long weekend-plays a role, Mr. Ariel says, but he hasn't seen strong evidence of that. And Richard Eakle, a technical analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., says, &quot;I think most people are more inclined . . . to be flat (that is, neither long nor short on a stock) going into a holiday.&quot; An investor who is long on a stock generally expects the price to rise; one who is short on a stock expects the price to fall.    Can the pre-holiday pattern help in timing stock purchases or sales? Alfred Goldman, technical analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, says, &quot;If I'm bearish and the market is lifting before a long weekend, I would increase my (short selling) into it. If I'm bullish, I would increase my buying Monday and Tuesday,&quot; before the Friday buying rush that usually precedes a holiday weekend.    Other analysts say investors should just ignore the pre-holiday phenomenon. &quot;I don't like (trading on) historical tendencies,&quot; says Justin Mamis, a technical analyst with Cowen andamp; Co. &quot;The one time you go out and advise it is the one time it doesn't work.&quot;    ---   Pre-Holiday Gains   Percentage of times Dow Jones Industrial Average has shown gain on last trading day before a holiday, 1897 to the present.
