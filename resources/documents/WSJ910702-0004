Amgen, a Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology company thatgenetically engineered the drug, said it will take an $88.5million after-tax charge against first-quarter profit relatedto the order. Amgen previously accrued a pretax reserve ofabout $35 million for the damage award.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts had forecast first-quarter profit of about $35million, or 72 cents a share. Based on that consensus andanalysts' comments yesterday, Amgen is now expected to post anet loss of around $54 million, or $1.13 a share. In theyear-ago quarter, Amgen had net income of $11.1 million, or57 cents a share.   Analysts' reactions ranged from shock to nonchalance. Buteven those who said they were stunned by the size of theaward indicated that it wouldn't inflict much long-termdamage on the rapidly growing biotechnology company.Investors apparently agreed, as Amgen shares fell only 87.5cents to $117 in national over-the-counter trading.   The damage award follows an April 1990 ruling by thearbitrator, Frank McGarr, that Amgen failed to comply withits obligations under the 1985 agreement. The agreementgranted Jandamp;J's Ortho Pharmaceuticals Corp. unit rights tomarket EPO for all therapeutic uses other than kidneydialysis patients in the U.S. The evidence suggested thatAmgen frustrated Ortho's efforts to win regulatory approvalfor its EPO brand, the judge ruled then.   Amgen and Jandamp;J were supposed to enter the market with theirrespective brands at the same time, a Jandamp;J spokesman said.Jandamp;J's brand, Procrit, wasn't approved until 19 months afterAmgen received approval to market its Epogen brand in June1989. (Procrit and Epogen are both manufactured by Amgen inthe U.S.)   The second part of the case involves two other potentialproducts, a hepatitis B vaccine and Interleukin II, that werepart of the 1985 accord. Amgen claims that Ortho failed tolive up to its obligation to develop and commercialize thosedrugs. Neither side has disclosed how much Amgen is seekingin damages, or whether an award would potentially offset theEPO-related damages. A hearing on damages related to the twoproducts is set for Sept. 9, Amgen said.   &quot;I would be surprised if any judgment {in the second partof the case} could be more than a fraction&quot; of the $164million, said Bob Kupor, a Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. analyst.&quot;The offset will be considerably smaller than the EPO damageaward,&quot; agreed David Stone at Cowen andamp; Co. The analysts saidthat Ortho isn't actively pursuing development of either ahepatitis B vaccine or Interleukin II. The Ortho spokesmansaid he didn't know the status of either project.   Analysts generally echoed Amgen's assurances, saying theultimate payment of damages won't have a material adverseimpact on the company. Amgen said that as of Sunday, the endof its first quarter, the company had $225 million in cashand equivalents and a $100 million untapped line of credit.   Cash flow from Epogen and a new drug, Neupogen, are sopositive that Amgen &quot;could afford this kind of deflectionwithout compromising {itself} strategically,&quot; Mr. Stone said.The award takes about a dime out of his per-share profitestimate of $4.60 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1993.He expects the damage assessment to be paid in that fiscalyear.   &quot;The worst has happened,&quot; said Kidder Peabody's Mr. Kupor.&quot;But it resolves a big uncertainty&quot; and that's a positive,albeit in a negative way.</TEXT></DOC>
