The Helsinki delegates, who represented most of the world'spopulation, also agreed to set up a system to help Third Worldcountries pay to replace equipment or Western-imported consumerproducts that emit the chemicals. But they left open how much aidwill be involved, how the industrial countries will finance it, andwho will control it.   Scientists at the four-day meeting said ozone was being lostmuch more quickly than envisioned in 1987, when leading producersof ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, agreed in Montrealto cut emissions in half by 1999.   However, Mostafa K. Tolba, director of the U.N. EnvironmentProgram, told delegates in Helsinki that the situation represents``an environmental time-bomb.''   CFCs are most commonly used in refrigerators, air conditioners,aerosols and cleaning materials for the metal and electronicsindustries.   When they rise into the atmosphere, they damage the ozone layer15 to 25 miles up that blocks some of the sun's ultaviolet rays.Scientists say the extra radiation increases cases of skin cancerand eye disease and damages smaller plants and animals crucial tothe natural food chain.   Delegates in Helsinki unanimously adopted their declaration tophase out the production and consumption of CFCs worldwide by theyear 2000.   Included in the accord was the United States, the world'slargest producer of CFCs. It makes nearly 40 percent of thechemicals and consumes about 30 percent.   The delegates also said they would phase out halons, which areozone-destroying gases used in sprinkler systems and fireextinguishers. They gave no target date.   Tolba told a news conference Friday that the Helsinki meeting``exceeded all expectations'' and succeeded in a ``translation ofwords into actions.''   But the Helsinki Declaration does not become legally bindingunless it as adopted as an addendum to the Montreal Protocol. Afollow-up meeting is scheduled in London next spring.   The delegates in Helsinki energetically debated proposals to setup the fund to help the developing countries conform to treatyrequirements.   Industrial countries argued that setting up a bureaucracy tooversee the fund could waste money better spent on aid.   Developing countries said they wanted assurances that the fundwould not take money from other aid projects like housing.   Environmental groups, which were among more than 100 observersat the closed meetings, charged that the declaration was``purposely kept vague on all major points.''   Representatives of Greenpeace said other hazardous chemicalsshould have been added to five CFCs and three halons to be cut inhalf under the Montreal pact.   Scientists from industrial countries joined Greenpeace inarguing that carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform, which areused in solvents, should be blacklisted. They said the chemicalshave a much greater ozone-depleting potential than CFCs.   Methyl chloroform is used in typewriter correction fluid.   The two chemicals escaped the original ban because they areshort-lived once released into the air. CFCs have an atmosphericlife of up to 100 years.</TEXT></DOC>
