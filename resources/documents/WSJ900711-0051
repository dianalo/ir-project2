Crude oil prices were up as much as 50 cents a barrel,enough in some cases to offset all the declines of recentdays. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futures priceof crude oil for August delivery rose 36 cents a barrel to$16.94.</LP><TEXT>   Although there was debate over the likely duration of therally, oil analysts attributed the upturn to two majorfactors. These were expectations that the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries finally may curb itsoverproduction and anticipation that the latest report by theAmerican Petroleum Institute would show reduced U.S. crudesupplies.   Little new information regarding OPEC output prospectscame out of yesterday's meeting of Persian Gulf oil ministersin Saudi Arabia, where King Fahd is taking a more active rolein efforts to restore stability to oil prices. But the APIstatistics, released after trading closed, showed thatdrawdowns in U.S. crude inventories last week were morebullish than expected, totaling nearly 3.7 million barrels.   Gasoline inventories also fell by 1.7 million barrels lastweek, about in line with industry projections. Meanwhile,fuel futures were stronger yesterday with unleaded gasolinefor August delivery rising 1.01 cents a gallon to 57.86cents.   One factor in the firming market was an interruption insupplies of methyl tertiary butyl ether from Arco ChemicalCo. The company had to reduce deliveries of the high-octanegasoline additive after last week's explosion at its Houstonplant.   Still, strength in the gasoline market helped propel U.S.crude oil prices higher. Also, some U.S. refiners increasedtheir field postings for the benchmark West TexasIntermediate crude by 50 cents a barrel to $15.75.   Shahrokh Nikkhah, a senior vice president withPrudential-Bache Securities, has turned &quot;cautiously bullish&quot;on oil prices as a result of this week's upturn. &quot;The $18.50to $20 level is definitely in sight&quot; for the near-term crudecontract on the New York Mercantile Exchange, he said. &quot;I'mlooking for a move up to the $20 level after the July 25 OPECmeeting,&quot; he added.   But some others don't believe prices have bottomed yet.&quot;Prices have every prospect of remaining under pressure&quot; atleast for two more months, said Peter Gignoux, manager of theShearson Lehman Hutton international energy desk in London.   In other markets yesterday:                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: As expected, the weekly cold storagereport showed lower-than-normal movement of pork bellies outof storage, producing a decline in prices of pork bellyfutures contracts. Pork bellies are used to make bacon. Thereport showed a net movement of 2.9 million pounds of belliesout of cold storage outside Chicago. That compares with a netof as much as 4.6 million pounds a year earlier and a 10-yearaverage net at this time of about four million pounds.Analysts don't think demand for bacon will keep pace with thesupply of fresh pork bellies. Higher-than-normal slaughterlevels have increased the supply of fresh bellies at a timewhen demand for pork is sluggish.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices extended Monday's declines.September delivery copper was off 0.60 cent a pound at$1.1675. Traders viewed the decline as a reaction to anoverbought market, in which prices over the past two weeksrose about 13 cents on unexpected developments. Meanwhile,one analyst said a cave-in at the El Teniente mine in Chilelast week may cause a loss of 18,000 tons of refined copperproduction. Yesterday's price decline occurred even thoughLondon Metal Exchange warehouse stocks of copper werereported to have declined by 2,325 tons to 51,225 tons, andCommodities Exchange stocks were off 965 tons to 19,313 tons.Fred Demler of PaineWebber observed that world-wide mineproduction of copper was off 3 1/2% in March and April fromthe same months last year. Also, he noted, shipments ofcopper world-wide were up 10% in the first four months of theyear from a year earlier. However, he expects demand tosoften later in the year.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices declined moderatelyon Middle Eastern selling, while silver was slightly higherand platinum edged lower. August delivery gold was off $2.80an ounce at $357.10. September silver ended with a gain ofone cent an ounce at $4.875. October platinum was off $1.10an ounce at $488.90. Selling of gold, thought to be by thesame Middle Eastern interests that caused prices to breaksharply on several recent occasions triggered early priceweakness yesterday. Jeffrey Nichols, president of AmericanPrecious Metals Advisors Ltd., Toronto, observed that whilethe amount of bullion sold didn't appear to be significant,traders are so nervous about the Middle Eastern selling thatthey tend to liquidate holdings as soon as it develops.</TEXT></DOC>
