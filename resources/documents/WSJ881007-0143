Perry, said Wall Street estimates that the company will post third-quarter net income of around $55 million, or $4.15 a share, aren't &quot;unreasonable.&quot;    A year earlier, Fina earned $21.2 million, or $1.60 a share, on revenue of $662.6 million.    Fina, a crude oil refiner and marketer 85% owned by Petrofina S.A., Brussels, said margins for the third period remained at about the same strong level of the second quarter, despite plunging crude prices.    &quot;The trend in the business is that when the price of oil drops, your product prices drop, but slower,&quot; Mr. Perry said in an interview. &quot;The margins at the pump are still generally very good.&quot;    About 85% of Fina's gasoline is sold through service stations that aren't owned and operated by the company, a figure the company is trying to lower to 50%.    Over the past 18 months, Fina has doubled the number of gasoline stations it owns and operates to about 200 and plans further, slow and steady increases.    Mr. Perry said some oil-producing countries have contacted Fina about the possibility of establishing a joint venture involving Fina's marketing operations. He wouldn't give any indication as to the seriousness of any talks.    Mr. Perry said the company's chemical operations are &quot;doing better than last year,&quot; but wouldn't be more specific. For 1987, Fina's chemical operations had record operating profit of $203 million on revenue of $670 million. </TEXT></DOC>
