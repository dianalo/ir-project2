MoserandM;Zortech Inc. is scoping out new turf for its C++ compiler line by readyingnew additions for 386-based DOS, The Santa Cruz Operation Inc.'s (SCO's) Unixand the Macintosh.andM;Using this approach, the company aims to offer developers a uniform C++development environment which can be tapped to create applications that spanmultiple platforms, said Sam Druker, development manager at Zortech inWoburn, Mass.andM;First out the door this month is Zortech's new DOS 386 C++ compiler, which isused with Phar Lap Software Inc.'s 386 DOS Extender to provide developerswith additional memory resources to create large, memory-intensive 32-bitapplications, he said.andM;The 386 compiler is an enhanced version of Zortech's flagship C++ 2.1offering, which is currently available under DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows.andM;The C++ 2.1 release features a Virtual Code Manager to handle overlays andcomes bundled with Rational System Inc.'s DOS Extender for building large286-based applications, he said.andM;The complete C++ 386 edition, priced at $995, contains 386-specific versionsof Zortech's Debugger, Tools and Function Library source code.andP;  Developersalso must purchase the $495 Phar Lap DOS Extender.andM;Unix is yet another target in Zortech's expansion plans.andP;  Currently in betatest is its SCO Unix 386 C++ Compiler, a $499.95 version of the Zortech C++Compiler 2.1; it is expected to be released within the next few months.andM;Zortech's third territorial conquest is the Macintosh.andP;  The company's C++Compiler 2.1 version for this platform is now in beta test and is the firstfull-fledged native C++ compiler for Macs, according to Druker.andM;The compiler will work within the Macintosh Programmers' Workshop developmentenvironment and will support Apple's C++ enhancements.andM;The $295 Macintosh C++ compiler, slated for release by April, will alsofeature extensive support for the Apple MacApp libraries, a framework used todevelop Macintosh-specific applications.andM;Also released this month was Zortech's version 2.18 maintenance release forits DOS, Windows and OS/2 C++ compilers.andM;This update offers increased compliance with the ANSI C++ standard and bettersupport for Windows, Druker said.andM;&quot;In the 2.18 release there's continuing support for the Windows environment,&quot;said Stephen Brobst, a Zortech C++ user and an independent softwareconsultant in Boston.andM;&quot;It fixes a conflict with the Windows.H file and provides better data-segmentmanagement.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
