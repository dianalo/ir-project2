Even this distinction may be fading as the United States,for example, acts to emphasize policies which directly encourage greatercompetition, both within its domestic market and between its foreignsuppliers and domestic gas interests, such as to induce suppliers, pipelinecompanies, and consumers to depart from long-term contractual links.The same policy direction may be less evident in Europe and is irrelevantin the unique circumstances of Japan except where encouragement of competitionbetween LNG suppliers offers a parallel to the U.S. experience.</TEXT></DOC>
