This proposed rule would set forth the policiesand procedures CCC will use to settle debts owed to CCC and other agenciesof the United States. To the extent practicable, the proposed rule wouldprovide that CCC policies and procedures would conform to the general guidelinesset forth in the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended by the DebtCollection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3711, <T3>et seq.</T3>). To the extent practicable, CCC would also follow theprovisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Parts 101-105)with respect to administrative actions undertaken by CCC to settle claims.In addition, this proposed rule would set forth the manner in which CCCand ASCS payments may be assigned at 7 CFR Part 1404 and delete the currentprovisions at 7 CFR Part 709.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received by July 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments concerning this proposed regulation should beaddressed to: Director, Fiscal Division, ASCS, U.S. Department of Agriculture,P.O.

This action does not constitute a review as to need, currency, clarity,and effectiveness of these regulations under DR 1512-1. No sunset reviewdate has been set for this regulation because review is ongoing. This action will not increase the Federal paperwork burden for individuals,small businesses, and others and will not have a significant impact ona substantial number of small entities. Furthermore, neither ASCS nor CCCis required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish anotice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of thisproposed rule. Therefore this action is exempt from the provision of theRegulatory Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.This action will not have a significant impact specifically upon area andcommunity development; therefore, review as established by Executive Order12372 (July 14, 1982) was not used to assure that units of local governmentare informed of this action. The Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (the Act), as amended by theDebt Collection Act of 1982, (31 U.S.C. 3711, <T3>et seq.</T3>), and the joint regulations promulgated thereunder bythe Comptroller General and the Attorney General (4 CFR 101-105) provideminimum standards for the administrative collection of claims by the UnitedStates. The Act also provides that nothing therein shall diminish the existingauthority of the head of an agency to settle, compromise, or close claims.The CCC Charter Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 714, <T3>et seq.</T3>), provides that CCC shall have authority to make finaland conclusive settlement and adjustment of any claims by or against itirrespective of the amount at issue. CCC is, therefore, not subject tothe provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Act or its implementingregulations. However, it has been CCC policy to follow the Federal ClaimsCollection Standards (FCCS) to the maximum practicable extent. The FCCSrequire each federal agency to take aggressive action to collect debtsowed it, and to cooperate with other federal agencies in their debt collectionactivities. Federal agencies are required to promulgate regulations consistentwith the standards.Currently, CCC follows procedures at 7 CFR Part 13 for the offset or withholdingof amounts approved by ASCS county committees for disbursement to agriculturalproducers. In all other cases, offset, withholdings, and stop payment policiesat 7 CFR Part 1408 are applicable. For procedures governing referrals ofclaims to the Department of Justice or the General Accounting Office theprocedures in FCCS (4 CFR Parts 101-105) may be followed. The regulationsat 7 CFR Part 1403 currently govern CCC policies regarding the assessmentof late payment charges, referral of delinquent debts to credit reportingagencies, and referral of delinquent debts to IRS for tax refund offset.This proposed rule would delete 7 CFR Part 1408 which sets forth the setoff,withholding and stop payment policies of CCC and establish under a singleheading at 7 CFR Part 1403, CCC policies and procedures governing the administrativecollection, discharge, and referral of debts. The proposed rule would also protect the right of CCC and ASCS to collectdelinquent debts when payments have been assigned by allowing offset ofany debts owed to CCC or ASCS by an assignor before payment is made toan assignee in accordance with the provisions of agricultural programsadministered by county and State ASC committees. Currently, offset mayonly be made of those debts entered on the applicable debt register priorto the date an assignment was accepted by CCC or ASCS. This change in policywould deter the circumvention of offset by such practices as the assignmentof payments to friends, relatives, partners, or subsidiary corporations,as well as increase the ability of CCC and ASCS to recoup delinquent debts.This change would apply only to those debts owed to CCC and ASCS; the currentprocedures would continue to apply to requests for offset received fromother federal agencies. Under the proposed rule, the late payment interest rate CCC would use wouldbe a departure from the standard late payment rate prescribed by 31 U.S.C.3717, which is based on the Treasury Department's current value of fundsrate. The Treasury Department has approved this alternative method of assessinglate payment interest. Currently, the late payment interest rate is setby CCC in a notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Such rate has been set at a fixed 13 percentand remained constant in spite of a dramatic fluctuation in interest ratesin the past six years. This proposed rule would provide that the late paymentrate assessed on delinquent debts would be based upon the rate CCC paysTreasury for funds. The late payment rate will be assessed at a rate threepercentage points higher than the Treasury rate that is in effect on thedate the debt becomes delinquent. In addition, for debts which remain delinquentfor ninety (90) days, an additional six percentage points will be assessed.This proposed rule is necessary to protect the financial integrity of manyfederal agricultural programs by ensuring the Government will be able tocollect, or otherwise settle, debts owed it by various individuals, organizations,and corporations. In addition, this proposed rule would delete 7 CFR Part 709, which setsforth the manner in which ASCS and CCC payments may be assigned, and setforth at 7 CFR Part 1404 the criteria applicable to the assignment of ASCSand CCC program payments.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>7 CFR Part 709 Assignment of payment. 7 CFR Part 1403 Interest on delinquent debts. 7 CFR Part 1404 Assignment of payment. 7 CFR Part 1408 Setoff, Withholding and stop payment policies.Accordingly, Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 709_[REMOVED] </ITAG>1. 7 CFR Part 709 is removed. 2. 7 CFR Part 1403 is revised to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1403_DEBT SETTLEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.1 Applicability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.2 Administration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.3 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.4 Demand for payment of debts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.5 Collection by payment in full. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.6 Collection by installment payments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.7 Collection by administrative offset. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.8 Withholding. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.9 Late payment interest and administrative charges. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.10 Waiver of late payment interest and administrative charges.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.11 Administrative appeal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.12 Additional administrative collection action. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.13 Contact with debtor's employing agency. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.14 Prior provision of rights with respect to debt. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.15 Discharge of Debts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.16 Referral of delinquent debts to credit reporting agencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.17 Referral of debts to Department of Justice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.18 Referring of delinquent debts to IRS for tax refund offset.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.19 Reporting of discharged debts to IRS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1403.20 Referral of debts to private collection agencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>15 U.S.C. 714b and 714c; 31 U.S.C. 3711-3716 and 3720A.. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1403.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Applicability. </ITAG>Except as may otherwise be provided by statute, this part sets forth themanner in which the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) will settle andcollect debts by and against CCC arising out of domestic transactions.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1403.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Administration. </ITAG>(a) The regulations in this part will be administered under the generalsupervision and direction of the Executive Vice President, CCC and theAdministrator, ASCS.
