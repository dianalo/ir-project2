Carbon NMR spectra of isotopicallyenriched tRNA/sup Phe/ reveal 12 individual peaks for 13 of the 14 methylgroups known to be present. The two methyls of N{sup 2}, N{sup 2}-dimethylguanosine(m{sub 2}{sup 2}G-26) have indistinguishable resonances, whereas thefourteenth methyl bound to ring carbon-11 of the hypermodified nucleoside3' adjacent to the anticodon, wyosine (Y-37), does not come from the[methyl-{sup 13}C] methionine substrate. Assignments to individual nucleosideswithin the tRNA were made on the basis of chemical shifts of the mononucleosidesand correlation of {sup 13}C resonances with proton NMR chemical shiftsvia two-dimensional heteronuclear proton-carbon correlation spectroscopy.Values of {sup 13}C longitudinal relaxation (T{sub 1}) and the nuclearOverhauser enhancements (NOE) were determined at 22.5, 75.5, and 118MHz for tRNA/sup Phe/ in a physiological buffer solution with 10 mM MgCl{sub2}, at 22{sup 0}C. These data were used to extract two physical parametersthat define the system with regard to fast internal motion: the generalizedorder parameters (S{sup 2}) and effective correlation times (tau/sube/) for internal motion of the C-H internuclear vectors. For all methylgroups the generalized order parameter varied from 0.057 to 0.108, comparedwith the value of 0.111 predicted for a rapidly spinning methyl grouprigidly mounted on a spherical macromolecule. Values of tau/sub e/ rangedfrom 4 to 16 ps, generally shorter times than measured in other workfor amino acid methyl groups in several proteins. Somewhat surprisingwas the finding that the two methyl esters terminating the Y-37 sidechain have order parameters similar to those of other methyls in tRNAand only 25% less than that for a methyl directly bonded to the base.</TEXT></DOC>
