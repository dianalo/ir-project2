Pentagon officials and others involved in the investigation say the consultants -- mostly small firms based around Washington -- apparently acted as paid conduits by gathering proprietary information from the military services and passing it on to arms contractors that kept them on retainer.    The Federal Bureau of Investigation is specifically exploring payments and bonuses given to the consultants and bribes that the consultants are alleged to have paid to Pentagon officials who supplied them with certain secrets.    One subject of the inquiry is Melvyn Paisley, a former Navy research chief who operates a small consulting firm here. Mr. Paisley's office and home were among 31 sites searched Tuesday under federal search warrants. A federal grand jury has been impaneled and will soon begin a full-scale investigation.    Among other contracts, Mr. Paisley was hired as a consultant by McDonnell Douglas Corp., whose St. Louis offices were searched by the FBI Tuesday.    In St. Louis, McDonnell Douglas confirmed that Mr. Paisley had been acting as a consultant to the aerospace company. &quot;We are not aware of any improper requests by the company to Mr. Paisley or any improper activities by Mr. Paisley on behalf of the company,&quot; McDonnell Douglas said.    The company said it was assessing documents served on it by federal investigators and producing information sought by the government.    According to documents unsealed by a federal court yesterday in St. Louis, investigators asked the company for several items connected with two of its major defense projects, the Navy's F/A-18 warplane and the advanced tactical aircraft.    Another central figure in the inquiry is William Galvin, a Washington consultant whose offices were searched Tuesday. Industry officials said that when Mr. Paisley was in the Navy, he occasionally recommended that major contractors consider hiring Mr. Galvin as a consultant to help them obtain Navy jobs. Messrs. Paisley and Galvin currently have offices in the same downtown Washington building. Neither was available for comment.    Among other contractors searched in the inquiry this week were the Norden Systems Inc. and Pratt andamp; Whitney Aircraft units of United Technologies Corp.; Hazeltine Corp., a unit of Emerson Electric Co.; Unisys Corp.; Teledyne Inc.; and Northrop Corp.    It is believed that one focus of the investigation is the F/A-18, built by Northrop and McDonnell Douglas with engines from Pratt andamp; Whitney.    The contractors generally said they were cooperating with the investigation but offered no further comment.    The FBI, meanwhile, obtained two additional search warrants and is expected to obtain others this week. Law enforcement officials said the first formal charges in the inquiry could come late this summer or in the fall. At least four middle-level Pentagon managers -- three with the Navy and one with the Air Force -- have been subject to searches so far.    The Air Force manager whose Pentagon office was searched Tuesday was Victor Cohen. According to a law-enforcement official, Mr. Cohen previously was under investigation by the U.S. attorney's office and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service in Los Angeles.    The official said investigators were looking into alleged irregularities involving Mr. Cohen and some contractor representatives but that the case was closed eight to 10 months ago and superseded by the broader investigation that emerged Tuesday. But Mr. Cohen's Washington lawyer, Seymour Glanzer, said the government dropped the West Coast investigation because it had &quot;no prosecutive merit.&quot; Mr. Glanzer said he had no other comment.    Officials familiar with the inquiry said several congressional staff members with access to sensitive contract information also are being investigated. One of the officials said that although Mr. Paisley is an important focus of the investigation, &quot;it would be wrong to assume that he is the principal focus or that we're not looking at other individuals and groups of consultants.&quot;    The most disturbing aspect of the investigation, industry and government officials agree, is the prospect that the consultants bribed Defense Department personnel to obtain valuable business secrets. A Pentagon official familiar with the investigation said, &quot;There's been a lot of selling of data.&quot;    Often, consultants are particularly useful to contractors because they have access to individuals and information in the Pentagon that aren't available to the contractors themselves. Moreover, as the Pentagon began setting up competition for more contracts, &quot;contractors made more use of consultants,&quot; said Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense who now works for the Brookings Institution. &quot;These people made a living knowing what was going on.&quot;    Among defense contractors and Pentagon weapons managers, consultants became a familiar presence. Because the consultants were often former Pentagon officials, their companies were sometimes referred to as &quot;rent-a-general/rent-an-admiral&quot; firms.    The network of consultants hasn't been without controversy. A film on contractor ethics prepared for training courses in the defense business poses a hypothetical case in which a consultant offers a contractor the proposal submitted by a rival defense firm. &quot;The problem of consultants and inside information is a well-recognized problem,&quot; said an attorney who represents defense contractors.    As early as 1985, criminal investigators from the Justice and Defense departments said they were pursuing allegations of widespread trafficking in privileged and classified information by defense consultants working for several major contractors. But the current investigation, begun two years ago after a former Navy official's tip, is the largest and most aggressive ever mounted against the problem.    Meanwhile, the investigation comes as a setback to the arms industry, which had enjoyed a relative lull in embarrassing procurement scandals. Mr. Korb said, &quot;This'll comfirm everybody's worst fears about the military-industrial complex.&quot;    ---   Edward T.
