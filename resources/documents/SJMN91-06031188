However, Culverhouse apparently was interestedin hiring Walsh only as both the Bucs' head coach and head of footballoperations.;    &quot;There's a lot of truth to that,&quot; Walsh, 59, said Tuesday bytelephone from his office in Menlo Park. &quot;I took my time and thought about it.It was a hard decision, but I think it's better to leave the coaching to theyoung Turks.&quot;;    With Walsh returning to NBC, the Bucs are expected tointerview former Philadelphia Eagles coach Buddy Ryan for their head-coachingjob today.;    New York Giants defensive coordinator Bill Belichick willinterview for the Cleveland Browns head-coaching job today and is expected tomeet with Culverhouse in Tampa on Friday, according to published reports.;   Walsh declined to disclose terms of his new contract agreement with NBC, butit's clear the network yielded to some of his demands in negotiations. Walshsaid he will be permitted to conduct four one-week clinics for NFLquarterbacks during the off-season and also will begin a one-week trainingcourse for college head coaches on the passing game and game management.;   Walsh also said he was reluctant to move from the Bay Area. &quot;Again, a bigreason is we have a home in San Francisco and it would be so tough for us toleave. NBC has been a good career for me, and I enjoy it.&quot;;    After leadingthe 49ers to three Super Bowl titles, Walsh has spent the past two years as abroadcaster with NBC. But he has not received the critical acclaim that hadbeen showered upon him as a coach.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  St. Petersburg Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tampa, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910131  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  364  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 31, 199100031188,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
