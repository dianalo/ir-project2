To achieve this goal,numerous and varied studies are being conducted to characterize the wastedisposal sites. Environmental data collected in support of other programsat ORNL are also of use to RAP. These studies are generating a voluminousamount of data on a scale unprecedented for ORNL. A computerized Dataand Information Management System (DIMS) was developed for RAP to (1)provide a centralized repository for data pertinent to RAP and (2) providesupport for the investigations and assessments leading to the long-termremediation of contaminated facilities and sites. 10 refs., 25 figs.,16 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
