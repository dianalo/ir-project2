IBM's mostattractive selling point here has long been the ability to exploit softwaredeveloped around the world for IBM's personal computers. But with thecompany's share of the Japanese market stuck below 10 percent, IBM decided inearly December that it needed to establish a single alternative to NEC -- evenif other Japanese companies would be big beneficiaries.;    &quot;It is a majorrisk,&quot; said Nobuo Mii, the IBM vice president who has championed the shift.&quot;We will have to produce lap-top computers and desk-top machines at the lowestcost in Japan, even compared to Toshiba or Hitachi. But we should have theconfidence that we can do it.;    The companies that announced Monday thatthey would sign contracts with IBM to build the new machines are ToshibaCorp., which has been one of the world's most successful makers of lightweightlap-top computers; Fujitsu Ltd., the world's second-largest computer maker;Hitachi Ltd.; Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp., and Mitsubishi ElectricCorp.;    Also signing contracts are Sony Corp., Sharp Corp., Sanyo ElectricCo., Ricoh Co., Oki Electric Industry Co. and Canon Inc.;    None of thecompanies is expected to drop its current computer designs, and some alreadyoffer some compatibility with IBM.;    Under the agreement, all the companieswill be able to design computers that are fully compatible with IBM's.;   Achieving true compatibility among personal computers is more difficult inJapan than elsewhere. Displaying kanji characters -- the thousands ofideographs drawn from China -- and two phonetic alphabets that are also usedin everyday Japanese writing requires very high-resolution display screens andcomplex instructions for processing characters. A result has been a plethoraof operating systems.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tokyo  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910312  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  429  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 12, 199100072042,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
