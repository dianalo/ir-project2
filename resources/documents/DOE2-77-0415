The method used for analysis of the experimentaldata permitted measurement of the total and differential cross sectionsfor production of {Delta}{sup ++} in a region of phase space which previouslyhas been practically uninvestigated. A detailed comparison of variouscharacteristics of the reaction with data at higher energies is carriedout. Results are presented on determination of the elements of the {Delta}{sup++} spin-density matrix.</TEXT></DOC>
