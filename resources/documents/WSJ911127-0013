Photographers scanthe throng for celebrities.   Who's coming? A movie star? Head of state?</LP><TEXT>   How about the &quot;Oracle of Omaha.&quot;   A moment later, Warren E. Buffett cuts through the gawkerswith his loping gait. A business school professor considersreaching for his hand. &quot;I was going to shake it, you know,and touch him,&quot; says Lawrence Lesser of the University ofMaryland, &quot;but I thought that would be indiscreet. At least Ican tell students I've seen him.&quot;   The hearing on the Salomon Brothers trading scandal inSeptember rapidly became a homage to Mr. Buffett, the firm'slargest shareholder and recently appointed chairman. &quot;GordonGekko and Sherman McCoy are alive and well on Wall Street,&quot;intoned Ohio Rep. Dennis Eckart, referring to fictionalcharacters famed for their avarice. &quot;Mr. Buffett . . . get inthere and kick some butt.&quot;   All the adoration is easy to understand. With the bashingof 1980s greed in high fashion, Mr. Buffett's homey,guileless persona fills a public yearning for integrity. At61, he is a standard bearer for long-term investing, theperfect antidote to the get-rich-quick schemers of WallStreet. He lives in a modest home in Omaha, Neb., bought for$31,500 in 1958. He has been married to the same woman for 39years, drinks Cherry Coke and wears ill-fitting suits --garments so embarrassing, he quips, that naming the tailorwould drive the fellow out of business.   &quot;With me, what you see is what you get,&quot; says Mr. Buffett.   Or is it?   His egalitarian philosophy notwithstanding, Warren Buffettis also a man who happily, and frequently, uses his financialclout and squeaky-clean image to get sweet deals notavailable to the everyday investor. And his billions in pastinvestment profits notwithstanding, he has made huge bets oflate on companies whose fortunes have soured -- not justSalomon Inc. but also USAir, American Express and ChampionInternational.   In spite of his reputation as a penny pincher who doesn'tneed or care to spend his estimated $4.3 billion of networth, he has some expensive tastes. Those suits? They'reactually Zegnas, hand-tailored Italian numbers -- at $1,500 apop. When in New York, Mr. Buffett often stays in a$1,400-a-night suite at the Plaza Hotel, complete with a barand spectacular view of Central Park.   And despite his conservative aura, Mr. Buffett has adecidedly liberal life style. He hobnobs with a glitteringcrowd of celebrities, media moguls and corporate chieftains,meeting at retreats he organizes with executives such asKatharine Graham of the Washington Post, Thomas Murphy ofCapital Cities/ABC and Donald Keough of Coca-Cola.   He has lived apart from his wife, Susan, 59, for 13 years(though they travel together when he meets with dignitariesin Paris, New York or Washington) while sharing his home inOmaha with his companion, Astrid Menks, 44. Their visitorshave included fellow billionaire William Gates, founder ofMicrosoft Corp., and Vice Grip, a San Francisco punk rockerwho is a friend of both Mrs. Buffett and Ms. Menks.   Who, then, is the real Warren Buffett?   A sketch from interviews with business associates, oldfriends and family members reveals a man obsessed withbusiness, brilliant at managing the media, secretive abouthis personal life -- and significantly more complex than hiscardboard image of Midwestern simplicity.   &quot;People still think Warren is this bumpkin from Omaha,&quot;says Mr. Buffett's cousin, actress Swoosie Kurtz, also anOmaha native. &quot;And he'd just as soon let them think that. Butnothing could be further from the truth. He's an enormouslysophisticated man.&quot;   &quot;Here he is, one of the biggest invisible market operatorsgoing, big arbitrages and all, getting better marketinformation than anybody -- and all people see is thishomespun, down-to-earth guy,&quot; says Michael Price, chairman ofMutual Series Fund Inc., a mutual fund. &quot;The fact is, no onehas done a better PR job than Warren Buffett.&quot;   Mr. Buffett declined to be interviewed, saying he's toobusy tending to Salomon. Speaking on his behalf, CharlesMunger, his longtime friend and right-hand man, says thatwhile there are some contradictions, Mr. Buffett is what heseems to be: &quot;a folksy guy with a steel-trap mind.&quot; He adds,&quot;It would be inaccurate to say that he has manipulated hispublic image so that it works better.&quot;   By any measure, Mr. Buffett's record as an investor is thestuff of legend. &quot;There's no one in the business world who issounder of mind than Warren,&quot; says Laurence Tisch, thewealthy chairman of CBS Inc. and a close friend of Mr.Buffett's for 30 years. &quot;He represents the best ofcapitalism.&quot;   The story of Mr. Buffett's success has been retold enoughto qualify as the business equivalent of Lincoln in his logcabin. The son of a Congressman who became a stockbroker, theyoung Mr. Buffett worked on Wall Street after graduating fromColumbia University business school in the early 1950s. Hereturned to Omaha in 1956 and started an investmentpartnership with money from family and friends.   His policy of rigorously analyzing companies -- anythingfrom windmill makers to anthracite producers -- paid offimmediately, earning huge returns for his investors. In 1969,Mr. Buffett dissolved the partnership and made BerkshireHathaway Inc., a declining textile company in which he hadpurchased a controlling interest a few years earlier, hisinvestment vehicle.   Eventually, he began buying an odd assortment ofcompanies, the largest of which he calls the &quot;sainted sevenplus one&quot; -- See's Candy Shops Inc., Nebraska Furniture Mart,the Buffalo (N.Y.) News, Borsheim's jewelers, FechheimerBros. uniforms, World Book encyclopedias, Kirby vacuumcleaners and Scott Fetzer Manufacturing Co. He folded theconcerns, along with insurance companies he had boughtearlier, into Berkshire, of which he owns 41.4%. Theseprovide a steady stream of profits and capital to fund theinvestments that bring him renown.   Those investments were few and simple -- but large. In the1970s he began to look for well-known, well-managed&quot;franchise&quot; companies whose prices didn't reflect theirunderlying value, and that he could hold long-term. Thisstrategy led to stakes in Washington Post Co. (of whichBerkshire now owns 14%), Geico Corp. (48%), CapitalCities/ABC (19.5%) and Coca-Cola (7%). Berkshire'sstock-market value is now $9.66 billion, reflecting a 23.2%annual growth in book value since 1965.   Berkshire's stake in Washington Post Co., bought during amarket slump in 1973 for $9.7 million, is now worth $325million. Its stake in Geico, an insurance company, waspurchased in the late 1970s and early 1980s for $45.7 millionand is worth a staggering $1.33 billion. The Cap Cities/ABCinterest, bought for $517.5 million in 1985, is worth $1.26billion today. The Coke stake is worth triple the $1.02billion paid for it in the late 1980s.   Still, cracks have been appearing lately in the Buffettempire. Some of the long-term investments have plateaued ordeclined in value. Washington Post is down 39% from its peakin 1988; Cap Cities/ABC is down 34% from mid-1990.Berkshire's largest recent common-stock investment, a 9.8%stake in Wells Fargo andamp; Co. bought in 1989 and 1990 for $289million, is up a modest 13.8%.   At a gathering of Mr. Buffett and some friends,Microsoft's Mr. Gates told the investor, &quot;You should unloadsome of these stocks, they've peaked.&quot; Mr. Buffett repliedthat ignoring such advice has been a key to his success --that stock fluctuations, even slumps that last years, havelittle bearing on companies' intrinsic value.   More controversial is Mr. Buffett's most recent investmentstrategy. Here's how it works: A prominent company is underattack by corporate raiders or faces business setbacks.Needing support, management approaches Mr. Buffett --considered a friendly and long-term investor -- and makes himan offer not available to other investors. Typically, he getspreferred stock bearing a healthy dividend -- assuring amodest return no matter what happens -- and the ability toconvert to common stock if the company's fortunes rise.Dividends from these deals have generally brought Berkshirean 8% after-tax return on its investment. The transactionsgarnered about $167 million in dividends last year, equal tojust over half of Berkshire's net investment income for 1990.   Mr. Munger defends the deals, saying it's appropriate thatBerkshire get terms not available to others because Mr.Buffett &quot;brings more to the party than just our money.&quot; Hesays Mr. Buffett provides advice and expertise in addition topatient capital that enables management to follow long-termstrategies. Indeed, he adds, other shareholders do benefit inthe long run if the stock rises.   &quot;Look, he gets these special deals because he's giving agiant, protective vote of confidence to existing managers,keeping them in their jobs,&quot; says Michael Lamb, of WealthMonitors, a publication which follows moves of big investors.&quot;This is quintessential Buffett -- sizing up people, relyingon his personal touch and judgment.&quot;   Of five such positions since 1987 -- in Gillette Co.,Salomon, USAir, Champion International Inc. and AmericanExpress, totaling $2.26 billion -- only one has paid off big.Mr. Buffett invested $600 million in Gillette preferred stockin 1989 after the company fended off hostile action bydissident shareholders. Two years later, he converted it intoan 11% stake in the razor company that is now worth $1.05billion -- a return of 75%, not including dividends.   The others haven't worked out so well. The biggest mess isat Salomon, which admitted last summer to violating biddingrules on Treasury-security trades and may face burdensomesanctions and litigation. It was to protect Berkshire's $700million stake in Salomon that Mr. Buffett has taken the reinsas its chairman.   At USAir, in which Mr. Buffett bought $358 million ofpreferred stock in 1989, bankruptcy rumors have swirled formonths. The airline recently reported its ninth straightquarterly loss and announced plans to cut $400 million inwages and benefits next year.   In Berkshire's 1990 annual report, Mr. Buffettacknowledged that his timing was bad because industryproblems have hurt USAir, but insisted that &quot;our USAirinvestment should work out all right.&quot; His right-hand man,Mr. Munger, is less optimistic today: &quot;Oh, USAir is adisaster.&quot;   Most embarrassing may be the situation at AmericanExpress. The company's 93% decline in third-quarter earnings,and a $265 million charge, was announced in mid-October, justtwo months after Mr. Buffett gave management a vote ofconfidence by buying a $300 million preferred-share stake. Itcan be converted into a 2.5% interest in the company, butprofitable conversion at the set price of $38 a share is adistant hope; the stock currently trades in the $18 range.   &quot;Is Salomon going to survive?&quot; asks Bruce Van Kooten, oneof the few analysts to follow Mr. Buffett closely (forOmaha-based Kirkpatrick, Pettus, Smith, Polian Inc.). &quot;IsUSAir going to be one of the surviving airlines? Fewcompanies are facing more uncertainty than American Express.These are very big question marks.&quot;   For handling the simpler managerial challenges ofBerkshire's operating companies, Mr. Buffett gets high marks,even though he's not involved much in the day-to-dayoperations.   Berkshire's empire of 22,000 employees at companies aroundthe U.S. is directed by 11 people, including Mr. Buffett,from a corporate headquarters in downtown Omaha thatresembles a doctor's office. It occupies the corner of afloor, at the end of a long hall with industrial carpet andplastic-weave wall paper. Mr. Buffett spends much of his timereading corporate filings and talking on the phone. Hisdeputies crunch monthly balance sheets from the operatingcompanies, deal with complex tax or investment issues andusually lunch at their desks -- deli sandwiches for them,Bronco hamburgers from a local chain for Mr. Buffett.   Mr. Buffett's closest adviser isn't in Omaha but in LosAngeles. Mr. Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman, is chairmanof its 80%-owned Wesco Financial Corp., a California savingsand loan. The wry, laconic Mr. Munger, 67, an Omaha native,first met his friend while working at Buffett andamp; Son grocersin the 1930s. They spend two to four hours a week talking onthe phone, with Mr. Munger acting as a sounding board for Mr.Buffett's ideas.   Since the Salomon scandal broke, Mr. Buffett has spentless time than ever conferring with managers of the operatingcompanies. &quot;I used to talk to him once every 10 days,&quot; saysCharles N. Huggins, chief executive of the SanFrancisco-based See's Candy. &quot;Now it's been only twoconversations since mid-August.&quot;   Though earnings of the non-insurance operating companieshave been flat of late, their performance is stillimpressive. The return on equity for this part of Berkshire'sbusiness, Mr. Buffett notes in the annual report, was 51%last year. But Mr. Van Kooten says that by generally acceptedaccounting principles, which Berkshire doesn't use for thiscalculation, the figure would be about 35%-still good, butnot quite as stunning.   As good as they are, the non-insurance operating companiescontributed just 32% of Berkshire's net income of $394.1million last year. Property and casualty insurancecontributed the rest, mostly from dividends and interest oninvestments. The insurance companies, which have cut back ontheir underwriting because Mr. Buffett believes competitionhas pushed premiums too low, hold almost all of the stockBerkshire has bought.   Because Berkshire relies so much on its investment income,and because many of the more recent investments haven't doneso well, some wonder why Berkshire's stock has risen to$8,475 a share {this is today's close} from a low of $5,500in the fourth quarter of 1990.   So what is Berkshire's underlying value? The answer isn'tsimple. Its stock trades at a robust 21 times last year'searnings, comfortably above the market average. But it tradesat only 1.6 times book value per share -- $5,297 at the endof the second quarter -- a ratio that is lower than themarket average.   Though Berkshire does have manufacturing and serviceoperations, Mr. Van Kooten points out, it is more like &quot;aclosed-end mutual fund, with most of its value in its stockportfolio.&quot; Funds of that type often trade at per share bookvalue or at a discount, says Mr. Van Kooten, &quot;meaningBerkshire may be overvalued.&quot;   Why? &quot;At this point, you'd have to attribute it tomystique,&quot; says Mr. Van Kooten. &quot;Call it the Buffett effect:That he is there to guide the portfolio -- that's now thebiggest factor in the stock price.&quot;   Mr. Buffett has been adept at managing his public persona.At annual meetings of Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett standsin an apron and hands out Coca-Cola, signs autographs andposes for photographs. When asked about the growingadoration, he quips, &quot;They still treat me the same at theMcDonald's in Omaha.&quot;   In recent years, Mr. Buffett has given few extended pressinterviews. One exception: In 1988, he talked to CarolLoomis, an editor at Fortune -- as well as a shareholder ofBerkshire, a longtime friend of Mr. Buffett and for yearseditor of Berk shire's annual report. The resulting Fortunecover story, &quot;The Inside Story of Warren Buffett,&quot; was aglowing tribute to him. (Ms. Loomis disclosed her connectionto Mr. Buffett in the article and conceded that her accountbore &quot;something less than total objectivity.&quot;)   Berkshire's annual reports, the major source ofinformation for Buffologists, as Buffett buffs callthemselves, are carefully crafted to enhance his image as afolksy sage: Will Rogers with an MBA. The annual reports maydiscuss such things as his four-year-old granddaughter'sbirthday party, the thoughts of Mae West, and Mr. Buffett'splain-spoken investment strategies.   The report for 1990 is emblematic. It regales shareholderswith a stirring tale of a landlord's attempt to force one ofSee's 225 candy stores to move from its Albuquerque, N.M.,location, only to be foiled by a letter-writing campaign byloyal customers. Typical of Mr. Buffett's ethos, it ends witha zinger: &quot;The sequel: Christmas sales in Albuquerque were upsubstantially.&quot;   Such warm, fuzzy images help deflect the kind of toughquestions that might be asked of other corporate moguls --questions like whether it is appropriate for Berkshire tosimultaneously have big investments in the parent of ShearsonLehman Brothers (American Express) and in Salomon Brothers.   &quot;With someone else there might be questions about conflictof interest,&quot; says Lawrence Armour, an American Expressspokesman. &quot;But with Warren, it never comes up. The man has agreat reputation. He's Mr. Clean.&quot; Mr. Munger says thatBerkshire's stake in American Express isn't large enough tocause a conflict.   Mr. Buffett's image also filters out another side of theinvestor that is little known: the relentless bottom-liner.   Mr. Buffett professes to love the media business and saysBerkshire's Buffalo (N.Y.) News has a larger percentage ofits pages devoted to news than any other U.S. paper. But, atleast by one account, middle managers at the paper heard adifferent message in a private meeting.   It was 1982, says copy editor Allen Greene, after thepaper's sole competitor in Buffalo went out of business and&quot;we just started printing money.&quot; At a managers' meeting, aneditor asked Mr. Buffett &quot;with profits going off the charts,if we could have some kind of profit-sharing plan,&quot; says Mr.Greene, who has since become head of one of the newspaper'sunions. &quot;Buffett said, `There's nothing you people on thethird floor {the newsroom} do that has any effect on myprofits, so I don't feel any desire to share them with you.'We all were stunned. We'd thought he was such a nice guy.&quot;   That isn't the only instance of Mr. Buffett's actionsseemingly being at odds with his public pronouncements.   Despite his criticism of Wall Street's casino mentality,for example, Berkshire made a pretax profit of $64 million inan artful arbitrage on RJR Nabisco bonds, says the annualreport. According to an account in &quot;Barbarians at the Gate,&quot;a book by two reporters for this newspaper about the takeoverof RJR Nabisco, Mr. Buffett encouraged Salomon to enter thebidding for the company. The Omaha investor told Salomon'sthen-chairman John Gutfreund and his lieutenants: &quot;I'll tellyou why I like the cigarette business. It costs a penny tomake, sell it for a dollar, it's addictive and there'sfantastic brand loyalty.&quot; Mr. Munger says the quote isgenerally accurate. &quot;Warren said it because they are sellingan addictive drug under a loyal brand name and that there'sno problem supporting their debt.&quot; But, he adds, Mr.Buffett's comment was simply &quot;a diagnosis of future cashflows, not of the morality of that business.&quot;   Mr. Buffett's grandfatherly image aside, the investor canexhibit toughness when he feels he has been wronged. Despite15 years of friendship, Mr. Buffett was quick to turn on Mr.Gutfreund after the Treasury bidding scandal erupted atSalomon. But of all the contradictions between his actionsand his public persona, the most jarring is also the mostpersonal: his marriage and his companion.   &quot;Warren is a hero, and people like their myths neat anduncomplicated,&quot; says Anthony Abbott, the owner of the FrenchCafe, an Omaha restaurant and nightspot. &quot;Of course, none ofthis is uncomplicated.&quot;   In 1977, Mrs. Buffett donned a sequin gown and begansinging torch songs -- her favorite was &quot;Send in the Clowns&quot;-- at the French Cafe's nightclub. There she met musicians,artists and intellectuals who began to spend time at theBuffetts' house.   One of them was Ms. Menks, then a waitress at therestaurant and an accomplished cook, who prepared a dinnerparty for the Buffetts and some house guests one weekend in1978. &quot;That's where it all started,&quot; says Ms. Menks, &quot;but Ican't say more because it's too personal.&quot; Soon, Mrs. Buffettmoved to San Francisco to pursue her singing career, Ms.Menks moved in, and Mr. Buffett settled into his currentarrangement -- alternating his time between the two women,who remain friendly but rarely accompany him together.   Ms. Menks says of her relationship with Mr. Buffett, &quot;Ihave the best of all worlds, and I wouldn't change anything.&quot;But Ms. Menks, whom Mr. Buffett has in the past introduced ashis housekeeper, expresses some irritation at being describedsimply as the &quot;former waitress&quot; or &quot;former hostess&quot; in thefew brief published accounts of their relationship. &quot;Look, Idon't want to be lumped in with those kinds of women. I'vebeen with Warren for 13 years,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm no bimbo andI'm no airhead.&quot;   Around Omaha, the situation causes swirling speculation.Ms. Kurtz, the actress, who divides her time between New Yorkand Los Angeles, says, &quot;Even for my crowd it'sunconventional. You live how? With whom? It's all verystrange.&quot; Mr. Gates of Microsoft, who visited Mr. Buffett oneweekend recently in Omaha, says that Saturday's lunch wasattended by Mrs. Buffett and Sunday's brunch by Ms. Menks.&quot;Look, I don't want to get into all that,&quot; he says.   Mr. Munger says, &quot;It's a relationship that never ever hada lie in it to anybody at any time. In some ways, that grouphas created something that is very traditional with all theold values and just has one quirk.&quot;   Over the years, the trio has developed its own rhythm. Ona recent Thursday, Ms. Menks picked up shirts from thecleaners -- 12 white button-downs, light starch -- so Mr.Buffett could pack his bags for the next day's flight. OnFriday, he and Mrs. Buffett were off to a Coca-Cola boardmeeting in Paris.   Despite their separation, Mrs. Buffett, whose 3.23%ownership of Berkshire's stock places her personal net worthat $314 million, is more active than ever in affairs of thecompany. Last April, she was elected a Berkshire director,and Mr. Buffett said she would take over Berkshire as hissole heir and run the company should he die. She also wouldpreside over a charitable trust that would be created fromMr. Buffett's $4.3 billion fortune -- the second largest inthe country after the Ford Foundation, with $6.1 billion inassets. Mrs. Buffett couldn't be reached for comment.   The Buffetts' three children, all grown, are slated toreceive little of their father's fortune. Mr. Buffett, whotold Fortune in 1986 that inheritance &quot;is a lifetime supplyof food stamps,&quot; will bequeath about $5 million to eachchild, according to sources close to the family.   Mr. Munger explains: &quot;Peter {a son} wanted a bridge loanfor his house. Warren turned him down. Howie {another son}wants this. Susie {a daughter} wants that. Warren is just astough on his children as he is on his employees. He doesn'tbelieve that if you love somebody the way to do him good isto give him something he's not entitled to. And that's partof the Buffett personality.&quot;   Mr. Buffett's plan to set up a charitable trust after he'sgone has raised eyebrows in Omaha, where his contributionsare felt to pale next to his vast wealth. &quot;It's a soresubject, a very sore subject,&quot; says Thomas J. Skutt, chairmanand chief executive of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co. and aBuffett friend. &quot;Warren really could do a lot for thecommunity with no sweat, considering his resources, whereasother people make great sacrifices.&quot; He says localphilanthropists are especially miffed because Mr. Buffett&quot;clearly understands how the images of earnest Omaha help himin his business.&quot;   Nonetheless, Mr. Buffett, a Democrat politically, hascontributed through his small foundation to variousorganizations, including Planned Parenthood and groups thatsponsor AIDS education. For the most part, he is viewed byOmaha with a mixture of fascination and pride. That prideevidently colors news about him in the Omaha World Herald,the city's main newspaper, which hasn't done a major pro fileof the investor in six years. Mr. Buffett was once a boardmember of the paper.   &quot;Around here, he's a guy who can do no wrong -- at leastnothing we can report,&quot; says Jim Rasmussen, a reporter whocovers Mr. Buffett for the World Herald.   Mr. Buffett is also responsible for making many localfolks rich. Omaha Buffologists estimate that about 200&quot;Buffett millionaires&quot; are sprinkled inconspicuously aroundthe city.   One of the richest is William Angle, a 66-year-oldphysician who lives in a well-worn wood-frame house off apot-holed road, reads electro-cardiograms at a local hospitalseven days a week and hasn't had a vacation in five years. In1956, &quot;Doc&quot; Angle collected seven doctor friends to hear Mr.Buffett's pitch one evening at a local chicken joint; eachinvested $10,000 with Mr. Buffett then, and a thousand dollars here and there over the next five years. Dr. Angle sayshis Berkshire shares now are worth more than $100 million.   &quot;Warren may seem easygoing,&quot; says Dr. Angle, &quot;but nothingupsets him like losing money -- he loves winning. He lovesthe game. The end is always money -- not to spend it, ofcourse, but to accumulate it.&quot;   Having one of America's most revered investors holed up inOmaha also is good for area stockbrokers, who try to read Mr.Buffett's next investment move. When a private jet landscarrying a chief executive -- like Citicorp's John Reed, whomade the pilgrimage in August -- local activity will pick upin a particular stock. George L. Morgan, a brokeratKirkpatrick Pettus, has published a booklet describinghimself as a &quot;Buffett-wanabee.&quot; It is titled &quot;Buffett andamp; Ihave Zero in Common (However, He Has More Of Them Than IDo).&quot;   &quot;I just want Warren to keep on being Warren,&quot; says thetaciturn Mr. Morgan, 46, who bears a striking resemblance tohis hero, &quot;so I can keep on being me.&quot;   But an old friend says that Mr. Buffett is not the personthat Omaha once knew. &quot;I think all this has changed Warren --the power and publicity and all,&quot; says Shirley Goldstein,who, along with her husband, is among the Omaha friends whostill see Mr. Buffett regularly. &quot;He's awfully far from thatsimple investor we used to know.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          WARREN BUFFETT'S charitable foundations made more than$515,000 in contributions in 1990 to local causes in Omaha,Neb.
