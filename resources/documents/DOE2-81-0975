Structure of complexes described and formationof coordination bond between N-atoms of amino- and azomethin groups isascertained on the base of IR, UV-spectroscopy data and magnetochemicalinvestigations. A possibility of the considered ligand tellurium atomparticipation in coordination interaction with metal ions indicated requiresadditional arguments.</TEXT></DOC>
