The FDIC acquired the Delaware credit card subsidiary of the former First RepublicBank Corp. when it took control of the failed bank holding company Aug. 2. Except for the credit card unit, First Republic was sold to NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., which renamed it NCNB Texas.    First RepublicBank Delaware had credit card receivables of $623 million. Citibank, a unit of Citicorp is the leading issuer of credit cards, with 18 million MasterCard and Visa credit cards and more than $16 billion in assets.    NCNB also bid for the credit card portfolio and expressed disappointment that it wasn't the successful bidder. But it said that it would solicit the credit card accounts formerly held by First RepublicBank Delaware.    In Dallas, a spokesman for NCNB Texas said the Delaware bank had about one million credit-card holders. Of that number, about 600,000 cards were active, and they had total balances outstanding of $600 million.    First RepublicBank isn't related to First Republic Bancorp. of San Francisco. </TEXT></DOC>
