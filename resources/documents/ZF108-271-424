 But the ads that claim&quot;You've seen him in People Magazine, on 'Good Morning America,' and on'Saturday Night with Connie Chung'&quot; do not refer to Donal Trump, Sean Penn,or any of the other celebrities responsible for the premature failure of somany channel-switch buttons.andP;  They refer to Clifford Stoll, professionalastronomer, top-notch programmer, savvy yo-yoist, and author of The Cuckoo'sEgg (Doubleday, $19.95).andP;  Subtitled &quot;Tracking a Spy Through the Maze ofComputer Espionage,&quot; this tru-detective tale has dazzled even such unlikelysources as Cosmopolitan, which the ads quote as saying that the book will&quot;grip&quot; you &quot;even if you don't know a byte from a bagel.&quot;andM;But if you do know better than to garnish your bytes with cream cheese andlox, don't hold the media hype against Stoll.andP;  When I spotted him on C-SPANat five one jet-lagged morning, the guy seemed slightly bemused by all theattention, and his interviewer didn't know what to make of him.andP;  On TV, Stollcame off as a brilliant naif, one of those slightly off-key geniuses by nomeans uncommon in real life but somehow excluded from televised reality.andP;  Inthe book there's more briliance and less naivete.andM;Stoll's celebrity could conceivably divert attention from his book to hispersonality.andP;  That would be a shame.andP;  Even if you don't count his recipe forchocolate chip cookies, The Cuckoo's Egg is essential reading for anybody whoworks with computers.andM;It's also painless reading--a detective yarn with a spellbinding plot.andP;  Inhis first few days as manager of a berkeley computer system, Stoll finds a75-cent disrepancy in user billing.andP;  He soon discovers that an unauthorizedoutsider has been accessing the system.andP;  With the help of a second machine--adecrepit PC--and a bunch of printers so ancient that their owners trade themfor cookies, Stoll begins monitoring the intruder's electronic incursions.andM;The situation turns out to be even worse than it looks.andP;  The interloper hasmanaged to give himself privileged access to the entire system.andP;  He hascleverly swiped a variety of passwords.andP;  And he's connecting through Stoll'smachines to a nationwide assortment of systems having to do with military andspace matters.andP;  From then on, it's a cat-and-mouse game as Stoll works totrace the intruder back through the phone lines, keeping the target systemssafe from depredations and at the same time trying not to top off themarauder that he's being watched.andM;CIA JARGONandM;Stoll's writing is clear and suspenseful, with a flair for detail.andP;  Inkeeping with his training as an astronomer, Stoll tells  us, he kept adetailed log of events.andP;  It shows: he reveals the particulars of everythingfrom the rites of Halloween in San Francisco to the Peculiar jargon of CIAoperatives.andM;Stoll unfolds his tale from his own point of view, and this personal elementis crucial.andP;  As a Berkeley anything-but-conservative, he's surprised to findhimself cooperating with the CIA and FBI and even wishing that they would bemore helpful.andP;  He's chagrined at the havoc his quest for the hacker wreaks inhis personal life, forcing him first to sleep in the lab and then live at thebeck of a pocket pager rigged to his hacker-catchers.andM;You marvel at Stoll's cleverness at figuring out--from the transmission delaybetween responses within the hacker's Kermit file-transfer protocol--roughlywhere the hacker should be; then you smile sympathetically at his reluctanceto give the data its most obvious interpretation.andP;  You wonder along withStoll why a hacker would bother stealing files of encrypted passwords whenthe encryption algorithm was guaranteed irreversible--and then shake yourhead when he reveals the simple brute-force process that makes decipheringthem almost trival.andP;  And you're likely to be as surprised as he is at thetenuous but real connection between his case and the one involving the virusdeveloped by Cornell student Robert Morris.andM;Stoll explains many of the specific holes in the systems he monitored--manyof them utter howlers.andP;  Bugs in the Unix text editors Gnu-Emacs and VI letusers move files into the supposedly protected system areas.andP;  A Unix mailprogram blithely allowed users to enter a debug mode that could give themtotal control.andP;  Another Unix program mindlessly interpreted excess charactersas system commands.andP;  And anyone who managed to wander into a supposedlysecure DEC VAX computer could run a short program to bestow fullsystem-manager privileges upon himself.andM;If simple access is all you want, however, you don't even need software bugs;a lax or inept system administrator will do fine.andP;  In one case, the hackersigns on with the user name &quot;field&quot; and the password &quot;service.&quot;andP;  Systemssoftware often comes with built-in standard &quot;backdoor&quot; passwords; systemadministrators often forget to delete them.andP;  Bingo.andM;NO APOLOGIESandM;Stoll brings a great deal of sheer moral outrage to the case in particularand the issue of computer security in general.andP;  His rationale for devoting somuch time to it boils down to the fact that the hacker is a thief: stealingcomputer time and snooping in the private files of hundreds of users.andP;  Stollholds no truck with the apologists for the &quot;harmless&quot; virus that RobertMorris unleashed on some 2,000 computers; he likens the stunt to letting theair out of the tires of 2,000 cars.andM;Stoll does discuss how hacking, frivolous and otherwise, poisons the spiritof community, forcing people to put locks on doors that had otherwiseremained open.andP;  But with so much emphasis on the specifics, he touches thelarger issues only briefly.andP;  And there are plenty.andP;  Take system integrity:the initial purpose of Stoll's surveillance was to find out what the hackerwas doing to the systems he hit.andP;  Were logic bombs  and viruses planted?andO;Were files affected?andP;  As it turned out, the answers were no and no, but oncea single unauthorized user manages to gain access to any file on the system,there's no definitive way to tell how or if the system has been otherwisecompromised.andM;The basic question of security--are your files and programs safe fromintrusion?--is just the first of a Pandora's trunkful.andP;  Privacy (can theambitious jerk at the next desk read your files?) is another; integrity (canthat jerk forge nasty memos under your name?), one more.andM;The list goes on and on.andP;  But most of us prefer to respond as one defensecontractor did after Stoll discovered someone fooling around in its system:&quot;We're running a secure shop around here and nobody can break in.&quot;andM;As the then-unknown astronomer said to himself: Right.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
