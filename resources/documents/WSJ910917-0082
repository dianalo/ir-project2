But in hours of questioning, the 47-year-oldnational security aide often found himself on the defensiveand reduced to repeatedly saying that he was unable to recallcritical exchanges testified to by former CIA colleagues.   Written answers by Mr. Gates, released yesterday by thecommittee, included dozens of cases where he is unable torecall details relevant to his role in Iran-Contra. And anembarrassing contradiction has developed between Mr. Gates'saccount and that of his former deputy, Richard Kerr, nowacting CIA director.   Mr. Kerr has said that as early as August 1986 he warnedMr. Gates of profiteering on U.S. arms sales to Iran andspeculation that funds were being diverted to finance the warin Nicaragua. Committee Chairman David Boren disclosedyesterday that a third CIA officer has said he recalls beingtold by Mr. Kerr of the alleged August meeting. And Mr. Borenconfirmed that in sworn, closed-door testimony last week, Mr.Kerr's recollection of the exchange is that Mr. Gatesindicated he had already heard rumors of a diversion.   More than a month later, in October 1986 -- when Mr. Gatesacknowledges he was warned about a possible diversion -- hisresponse was still slow and sometimes inconsistent. Forexample, he said he never questioned officers in the CIA'sCentral America or Near East divisions about the evidence ofa diversion. Yet in the same period, Mr. Gates recognizedlinks between the two operations, according to statements bythe then-chief counsel for the CIA, David Doherty.   In documents released yesterday, Mr. Doherty is quoted astelling the committee that Mr. Gates worried that a FederalBureau of Investigation probe of Southern Air Transport'sflights on behalf of the Contras would spill over into theIranian operation, in which the Miami-based cargo line alsoplayed a part. Mr. Gates said he had no recollection of sucha discussion with Mr. Doherty, who has said the meeting tookplace in mid-October 1986.   Even as the Iran-Contra operations were under way, theReagan administration was actively sharing intelligence withIraq, Tehran's enemy. And the CIA's role in this operation isexpected to be an issue now in Mr. Gates's confirmation. Inhis opening remarks, Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) said thecommittee is still seeking information from the agency on theextent of its involvement. And though the substance of theIraq operation remains highly sensitive, it raises legalquestions as to whether the agency went beyond its mandateand avoided submitting a finding to Congress.   Much the same authorization issue is at the heart of theIran-Contra affair, because the administration and CIAwithheld information from Congress. Within the agency, theIraq intelligence-sharing is sensitive both because of Mr.Gates's role and that of Thomas Twetten, the former chief ofthe CIA's Near East branch and now head of the powerfuloperations division.   A protege of the late CIA Director William Casey, Mr.Gates is said to have enjoyed a close, almost father-sonrelationship with the director. Yet the same ties now hauntthe younger man as he seeks to establish himself in his ownright.   The nominee portrayed himself as a &quot;tag-along&quot; in thefinal tumultuous days after the arms sales to Iran weredisclosed in the fall of 1986. And though he played a role inpreparing testimony for Mr. Casey, Mr. Gates said he neverbothered to check what the director finally told Congress,even when they met several times in the immediate aftermath.   &quot;Casey was writing and tearing up pieces of paper,&quot; saidMr. Gates of a chaotic session at CIA headquarters inNovember that year before Mr. Casey testified. &quot;It waspandemonium.&quot;   &quot;I should have been more skeptical about what I was told,&quot;Mr. Gates said, with special reference to Mr. Casey, and thewould-be successor pledged that he would resign in the futureif ordered to withhold information from Congress for aprolonged period.</TEXT></DOC>
