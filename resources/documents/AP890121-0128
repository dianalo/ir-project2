(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials at a troubled District of Columbiaprison complex spent Saturday cleaning up from a series of firesthat left one prisoner dead, another injured, and gutted anadministration building.   Inmates took advantage of a power failure that occurred Fridaynight to set a series of fires, according to Corrections Departmentspokeswoman Pat Wheeler.   Two inmates were stabbed during the disturbance, a press releaseissued Saturday by the D.C. Department of Corrections said. Bothwere taken to Dewitt Army Hospital at nearby Fort Belvoir, where oneof the inmates was pronounced dead.   The dead inmate was identified as Andre Drake, 26, of Washington,D.C. The other prisoner, Jerry Gill, 36, a Shelby, N.C., native, wastaken by helicopter from Dewitt to D.C. General Hospital, where heis listed in stable condition.   Gill, who is eligible for parole in August 1996, is serving afive- to 15-year sentence for rape and several other convictions.Drake had been convicted of simple assault but was also serving twoto five years for unauthorized use of a vehicle. He would have beeneligible for parole in 1990.   One blaze engulfed the prison's main adminstration building, asFairfax County, Va., firefighters refusing to enter the groundsstood by for more than an hour. They said they were waiting untilprison guards could contain inmates who roamed the grounds freely.   A damaged heating system, smoke and water at one of the complex's25 dormitories forced prison officials to move about 60 prisoners tothe D.C. Jail. Officials have said the prisoners will probably spendanother night there.   Damage estimates from the fires have not been released.   The prison _ one of 10 correctional institutions in the Lortoncomplex _ is about 20 miles south of Washington and held 6,165prisoners last month.   District Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., who came to the city-runprison complex from a presidential inaugural celebration at thecity's convention center by helicopter, downplayed the incident.Barry was accompanied by his wife, Effi.   Rating the incident at two ``on a scale of one to 10,'' Barrysaid, ``it could have been a lot worse.''   Corrections officials said a power outage had briefly knocked outthe lights at the facility.   William Falls, an operations manager at the Virginia PowerCompany said Saturday that about 620 customers in the nearbyOccoquan area of Prince William County, Va. loss power from 9:15p.m. until about 10:13 p.m. Friday. But he said he had not beennotified that the prison had experienced an outage.   At least four fires were set during the incident, according toLt. Mike Reilly, spokesman for the Fairfax County fire department.Ms. Wheeler said the fires which began at about 9:30 p.m. werebrought under control at about 2:30 a.m.   One blaze destroyed the main administration building for themedium-security central facility. One dormitory and a supply unitalso received ``minor damage,'' Ms. Wheeler said.   Police from Fairfax County, the district and Virginia StatePolice ringed the outer fences to guard against escape attempts,county officials said. All inmates were accounted for within aboutfour hours after the fires started.   Members of the D.C. police department's special operationsdivision and civil disturbance unit _ some on overtime duty becauseof the events surrounding President Bush's inauguration _ went tothe scene, as did about a half dozen D.C. fire department units,police said.   The disturbance was the latest in a series of problems plaguingthe city prison system, including escapes, accusations of drugdealing inside prison walls, disorders and years of litigation toreduce chronic overcrowding.   But corrections director Hallem Williams said early Saturday thedisturbance was not caused by overcrowding. ``We are in compliancewith the cap and overcrowding was not the issue,'' he said. In July1986, fires set by inmates destroyed four dormitories at theOccoquan area of the correctional complex. That blaze was blamed forseverely intensifying the crowding that has plagued the prisonsystem.</TEXT></DOC>
