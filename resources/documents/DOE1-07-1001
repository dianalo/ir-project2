Both substancesare made of distorted tetrahedral cations and anions of TcO/sub 4//sup-/. In tetramethylammonium pertechnatate ion packing is close to CsClstructural type. In tetrabutylammonium pertechnetate packing is definedby position of coordination polyhedrons made of tetrabutylammonium cations.Transition from alkali metal and ammonium salts to those with large organiccations is followed by ''compression'' of pertechnetate ion. Distortionof anions is described by one type of C/sub 3{nu}/ symmetry and is probablydue to vibronic interactions in pertechnetate ion.</TEXT></DOC>
