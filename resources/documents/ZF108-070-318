in acquisition management.andP;  The annual DODIRM budget is $9 billion, with $4 billion of that going toward new systems.andM;Among other fallout from the management review, the Army's InformationSystems Command at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., will be streamlined, said Lt.andP;  Col.andO;Dick Bridges, an ISC spokesman.andP;  He declined to discuss details before thefiscal 1991 budget goes to Congress.andM;As for the Navy and Air Force, spokesmen designated as single sources ofinformation about the management review said IRM officials will not getdetails about the impacts until the budget is issued.andM;The management report said the services must adopt single ADP systems forpayroll, warehousing, accounting and supply management.andP;  A Pentagon workgroup has been studying the IRM initiative since autumn.andM;IRM officials already are planning systems with CIM in mind, especially theprobability that portability standards such as the Government Open SystemsInterconnection Profile and the Posix interface between applications andoperating systems will be required.andM;Planning for CIMandM;&quot;We're tracking it,&quot; said Richard Colver, program manager for the Army's newSustaining Baseline Information Services (SBIS) system.andM;&quot;The open systems standards we're using are the same ones being looked atfrom a software development point of view in CIM,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We want to bein a position so that, regardless of how CIM finally works out, there isgoing to be [in the Army] a structure in place for users to access it.andM;&quot;We want to be able to support the Army's CIM requirements, and we're doingthat by putting an infrastructure in place that won't restrict whatapplication systems can run on it,&quot; Colver said.andM;SBIS will become the Army's principal platform for administrative informationprocessing, beginning in 1992.andM;One industry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said CIM likelywill be developed as a joint venture among the services and other DODagencies, with &quot;one service providing assets to another service.&quot;andP;  He saidCIM &quot;will probably shake out more as a common set of applications forhardware that will stay service-unique.&quot;andM;Turf ProtectionandM;Bod Dornan, vice president of Federal Sources Inc., a Vienna, Va., consultingand research firm, questioned whether the services would be willing to acceptcommon systems.andM;&quot;All those bureaucracies and fiefdoms have evolved, and it's going to beextremely difficult to get them to consolidate,&quot; Dornan said.andM;But in a recent interview, David Borland, the director of the Army'sInformation Systems Selection and Acquisition Agency, said there is a newmultiservice consciousness at DOD.andM;&quot;People are beginning to thing about systems, any system, with the questionin mind of how it might be applicable to other services,&quot; Borland said.andO;&quot;They're asking whether or not what's being done or planned has already beendone elsewhere.&quot;andM;The new acquisition chain of command resurrects a previously mandatedstructure.andP;  Under the plan, John Betti, undersecretary of Defense foracquisitions, will oversee full-time acquisition executives in each service.andM;Program executive officers (PEOs) who will oversee a &quot;portfolio&quot; ofindividual programs will report to the service acquisition executives.andP;  ThePackard Commission recommended three years ago that DOD use a PEO system, butonly the Army followed through.andM;The new structure will make the PEO the planner of corporate strategies andallow program managers to concentrate on developing systems, Betti said.andP;  Inthe current structure, too many Navy and Air Force program managers &quot;spendmore time working the [bureaucracy] than they do on their own program,&quot; hesaid.andM;Cutting the RegsandM;Betti said the DOD acquisition work force of 500,000 employees wrestles withabout 12,000 directives and regulations.andP;  He said officials hope to cancel oreliminate by combining as many as two-thirds of them.andM;&quot;Only those which add value will remain,&quot; he said.andM;The total DOD acquisition work force will be reduced by 16,000 in 1991 and by42,000 people over five years, Cheney said.andM;Reaction from the IRM community to the report as tentative.andM;&quot;Call me a skeptical optimist,&quot; Dornan said.andP;  &quot;I've been around DODacquisitions for about 25 years, and there have been reports and presidentialcommissions in the past, but most of the movement we've seen has been in thewrong direction.&quot;andM;He hailed moves to strengthen the program managers and improve theacquisition corps.andM;Joe Tarell, president of Electronic Data Systems Corp.'s Military SystemsDivision, said speeding up the acquisition process will improve efficiency.andM;&quot;People in the individual commands have requirements to fulfill and they'llgo out and do it themselves because they don't want to wait,&quot; Tarell said.andO;&quot;By the time a contractor who's won a contract gets there, the situation isdifferent than when he bid on it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
