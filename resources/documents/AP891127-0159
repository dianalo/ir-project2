The rebel leader, former commandant Ahmed Mohamed, resignedrecently in a dispute with the 70-year-old president, an officialat the Comoro Embassy in Paris said, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   He said the Sunday night assassination was not a coup and thatMohamed was under arrest. The number of attackers was not divulgedand the official said he did not know if anyone else was seized.   Abderrahmane was killed in a firefight between rebel soldiers ofthe regular army and his 300-man presidential guard, state RadioComoro said. It said a guard officer also was killed.   The head of the Supreme Court, Mohamed Djohar, took over asleader of an interim government as dictated by the constitution,the official said. The government declared a 40-day period ofmourning.   Abderrahmane had survived coup attempts in 1983, 1985 and 1987.His government denied reports of a coup attempt in 1981.   The Sunday attack took place in the capital of Moroni, on themain island of Grand Camore, home to half the nation'spredominantly Moslem population of 500,000. The Comoros, which liebetween Mozambique and Madagascar, were governed by Abderrahmanefor all but three years since 1972.   The former French colony is among the world's poorest and leastdeveloped nations, with an estimated annual per capita income of$339. About 60 percent of the population is younger than 20.   Abderrahmane will be buried Tuesday on his native island ofAnjouan, said Radio Comoro, monitored on the French-administeredisland of Mayotte.   The fighting apparently did not spill into the streets. BruceThompson, manager of the Galewa Sun hotel, told the South AfricanPress Association by telephone everything was normal _ ``The townis very quiet.''   Three weeks ago, Abderrahmane won a referendum allowing him toseek a third six-year term when his term expires next year.Official results showed the measure passed with 92.5 percent of thevote.   The five opposition parties complained of voting irregularitiesand opposition leaders in Paris said Abderrahmane jailed criticsshortly after the balloting.   Abderrahmane, a Moslem was first elected president in 1972, whenthe archipelago was still a French possession. The Comorosunilaterally declared independence in July 1975 and Abderrahmanebecame head of state.   He was overthrown a month later by Ali Soilih, who saidAbderrahmane had amassed personal power in a dictatorial style, butreturned to power in 1978 in another coup led by French mercenaryBob Denard.   Denard, now 60, created the black-shirted presidential guard andstaffed it with European soldiers of fortune. He became a specialadviser to Abderrahmane, converted to Islam and settled in theislands. It was not known Monday whether he played any role in thelatest episode.   The presidential guard was better equipped and trained than the700-man regular army and many Comorans came to see it as a deviceto keep Abderrahmane in power.   Abderrahmane resisted calls to reform his regime and accusedFrance, the former colonial power, of fomenting rebellion againsthim.   He had long been irked by France's refusal to cede control ofMayotte to his government. The island decided in a 1975 referendumto remain French.   President F.W. De Klerk of South Africa sent a message ofcondolence Monday addressed to the ``acting head of government''condemning the assassination.   South Africa is a major foreign investor in the republic. Thethree islands of Grand Comore, Anjouan and Moheli cover 718 squaremiles.   The republic's main income is from tourism and the export ofperfume, copra, coconuts, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon.</TEXT></DOC>
