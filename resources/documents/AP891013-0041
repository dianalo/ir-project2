Lutsenko, thepresident of the Nika TV company, told the weekly newspaper Nedelya.   The company is working on its own programming in severalprovincial cities and hopes to be on the air regularly in about ayear, the report said.   State-run TV has been one of the chief means through which theSoviet Union has tried to inculcate officially approved values intothe population.   It has become freer under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'sreforms and some programs have sparked controversy. On one program,there was a debate on whether Vladimir I. Lenin's body shouldremain in its famous mausoleum on Red Square.   The majority of its programming, however, remains staid.   Lutsenko told Nedelya that he recently had been to the UnitedStates to pick up the rights to show U.S. films in the Soviet Union.   ``In Hollywood, I concluded two contracts according to which weobtained the rights to 5,000 of the best American films,'' he said.Official TV occasionally shows foreign films, and its coverage ofevents and the cultural life of other countries has increaseddramtically in the past several years.   Another aim of the network is to uncover local talent in thecities where it is operating, and help them find a place onnational Soviet TV and abroad, he said.   Nedelya's article was accompanied by a picture of Lutsenko, byprofession a scholar of Asian affairs, interviewing American singerJohn Denver in Colorado.   Nika TV plans to use official television's communicationsinitially but eventually is seeking its own satellite system.   Even though it will be independent of official television,Lutsenko said Nika TV plans will have an oversight board that willincludes parliamentarians, members of the Communist youth league,the Union of Filmmakers and others.   ``We are all in the same boat, and Nika TV does not plan to rockit,'' Lutsenko said. ``We will not be out of control.''   However, it plans to focus much of its programming on the SovietUnion's current political and economic difficulties, he said.   ``The pain and losses of our economy, culture, ecology _ theseare the basic themes of our programs. Ecology is the firstpriority,'' he said. But there also will be entertainment, musicand sports.   The company has branches in Leningrad, Tashkent, Perm, and AlmaAta, and is organizing in Vladivostok, Odessa, and the Balticrepublics, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
