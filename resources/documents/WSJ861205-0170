Boddewyn argues that &quot;Smoking Ads Don't Get People Hooked.&quot; However, the majority of Americans consider tobacco advertising a major influence in promoting the killer habit.    Approximately 57% of the public thinks that cigarette advertising causes youngsters to smoke. Also, 47% thinks that cigarette advertising makes it harder for smokers to give up the habit. If the tobacco industry didn't agree with these stats it wouldn't concentrate so heavily on using young models in its ads.    Mr. Boddewyn writes of ads showing &quot;young-adult smokers living the good life and having clean fun . . .&quot; an indicator of the outrageous lies perpetuated by the tobacco industry. Living the good life and clean fun is in direct opposition to the result of cigarette smoking on the lives of its victims. What does the good life have in common with lung cancer or emphysema?    Each year 560,000 New Yorkers attempt to quit smoking. Many of them succeed. Many more would be successful if they weren't bombarded by advertising.    Cigarette smoking causes 360,000 premature deaths in this country annually. The imagery associated with smoking by the tobacco industry is sophistication, athletic abilities and sex appeal -- the qualities teen-agers are in a hurry to achieve. The industry is interested in maintaining its profits, not in protecting the lives and health of American youth.    Edith Ewenstein   General Director   New York Lung Association   New York   ---   Mr. Boddewyn is correct that tobacco ads do not hook smokers. Nicotine hooks smokers; the ads are just a lure. They are, however, a highly effective lure. There is substantial evidence that advertising increases tobacco use. A preponderance of econometric studies on the subject have concluded that advertising increases cigarette consumption.    There is also significant evidence documenting the influence of tobacco advertising on children. In the six years following introduction of Virginia Slims and other &quot;feminine&quot; cigarettes, smoking by teenage girls doubled. The television promotion of smokeless tobacco featuring sports and music stars was followed by an epidemic increase in smokeless tobacco use by adolescent boys. These were not, as tobacco industry representatives assert, coincidental phenomena. Increased tobacco use among young people was the predictable result of deliberate promotional strategies.    Also, Mr. Boddewyn's presentation of smoking in foreign countries is misleading. While it is true that cigarette advertising was outlawed in Italy and smoking still increased, this was at least partly because cigarette companies illegally promote smoking in Italy, treating fines as a routine cost of doing business.    Given the addictive, lethal quality of tobacco, and the deceptive means used to promote its use, the evidence that advertising increases consumption is sufficient to warrant a ban.    Joe B.
