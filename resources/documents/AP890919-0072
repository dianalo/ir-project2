A clash also was reported near the U.S. Embassy in Manila betweenpolice and leftist students protesting Quayle's planned visit to thePhilippines. Police fired pistols in the air to scatter thestudents, who then withdrew to a nearby park. No arrests were report.   In Seoul, hundreds of riot police lined the route taken byQuayle's heavily-guarded motorcade as he went from a militaryairport outside to Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon's office at thestart of two days of talks.   Radical students opposing Quayle's visit staged a small protestat Seoul Municipal Polytech University, where about 100 studentsburned a U.S. flag and chanted ``We oppose Quayle's visit to thedeath.''   At Kyunghee University in eastern Seoul, 50 students burned aU.S. flag and an effigy of Quayle. They also shouted slogans againstnewly assigned U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg, describing him as a``CIA master of political manipulation.''   Protests were reported at two other Seoul campuses, but there wasno confrontation with police.   About 500 radical students shouting ``Yankee go home!'' battledriot police with firebombs and rocks in the southern city ofKwangju, police said.   The protests were minuscule by South Korean standards anddissident groups made no effort to organize demonstrations inprotest of Quayle's visit. The radicals are demanding an end toclose ties with Washington and expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troopsbased in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.   South Korean and U.S. officials say the U.S. troops must remainto ensure North Korea does not attack the south. Washingtonintervened on behalf of the south during the 1950-53 Korean War andhas kept troops in the country ever since.   Quayle and his wife Marilyn were greeted by the prime ministerand top Cabinet ministers on their arrival from Alaska. Two Koreanchildren presented the Quayles with flowers and the vice presidentinspected an honor guard.   Quayle is to meet President Roh Tae-woo and heads of the mainpolitical parties on Wednesday.   Quayle is expected to urge the South Korean government to keepits commitment to bringing in full democratic rule since Roh tookpower in February last year. The United States is unhappy about arecent wave of arrests of opponents of the Seoul government.   South Korean opposition leaders were to tell Quayle about theirconcerns about the deteriorating human rights situation, oppositionparty officials said. A National Assembly report released Sundaysaid 2,094 people had been detained on political charges since Rohcame to power in February 1988.   U.S. officials, who would not be named, said Quayle would urgethe Roh government to show greater respect for human rights in viewof the jailings and other government moves to curb opposition.   Roh, a former general, has helped introduce broad democraticreforms, but conservative groups within the government are taking atougher line. Opposition groups contend the government is backingoff its promise of full democracy.</TEXT></DOC>
