Nelson and Thomas Kamm (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> TNM FIN INS </IN><TEXT>   The three rivals seeking control of Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. appeared to be neck-and-neck in the frantic scramble to buy shares and gather as many allies as possible ahead of two key rulings expected today from Belgian authorities.    Financial sources yesterday said groups led by Carlo de Benedetti, Andre Leysen and Cie. Financiere de Suez and their allies each held between 20% and 30% of the giant Belgian holding company's shares, while the number of available shares on the market dwindled in heavy trading.    The latest developments leave a complex set of possibilities surrounding today's rulings. A Brussels court is expected to rule on the legality of 12 million shares issued by Generale de Belgique in an effort to defend itself from a takeover by Mr. De Benedetti by diluting his stake, while the Belgian Banking Commission will consider whether to allow Mr. De Benedetti to launch a bid for an additional 15% of Generale de Belgique's shares.    Mr. Leysen, the chairman of Gevaert N.V. and leader of a group of companies battling for control of Generale de Belgique, yesterday announced to a packed new conference in Brussels an expanded list of Belgian partners in his group. He identified five new partners that together with other members of his group already control 23% of Generale de Belgique's shares. He also said another, unidentified, European ally holds 4.5%.    Thus, Mr. Leysen said, his group already controls 27.5% of the company, which would jump to 49% if the court rules Generale de Belgique's share increase legal. Mr. Leysen's group has an option to buy 10 million of the new shares if they are ruled legal.    The new Belgian partners are the insurer Groupe AG, the brewer and holding company Artois-Piedboeuf Interbrew, the newly formed Flemish investment bank Lessius, Banque Nagelmackers and the insurance company Prevoyance Sociale.    Meanwhile, financial sources said friends of Mr. De Benedetti's group have accumulated a stake of about 12% in Generale de Belgique over the past few days, which Mr. De Benedetti eventually could add to his current 18.6% stake. And Suez is said to have built up its holding to between 13% and 18%, which, added to stakes of French allies like a unit of Lazard Freres andamp; Cie. and Cie. Generale d'Electricite, could add up to well over 20%. Suez confirms that it owns 10% of Generale de Belgique but won't comment on the reports of increased buying.    At his news conference, Mr. Leysen held open the possibility that his group would enter into an accord with either Mr. De Benedetti or the group led by Suez. Sources close to the companies of Mr. Leysen and Mr. De Benedetti said an accord between the two men still seems highly likely, though the two still disagree on important issues about how the Generale de Belgique that will emerge after the battle would be managed.    &quot;I don't have any preference between Mr. De Benedetti or Suez,&quot; Mr. Leysen said. &quot;We must respect all the other shareholders. They are there and we have to acknowledge them.&quot;    In any case, today's rulings are critical. Here are some of the possible outcomes:   --The Banking Commission delays Mr. De Benedetti's bid again and the court approves Generale de Belgique's capital increase: This is the worst case for Mr. De Benedetti and leaves Mr. Leysen's group set to take 49% of the company. It dilutes Mr. De Benedetti's current holdings to about 12%, but as a single force with a clear vision, he still could influence the group significantly.    --The commission delays the bid and the court rejects the capital increase: This would give Mr. De Benedetti, with an undiluted 18.6% stake, the chance to negotiate with existing shareholders like Mr. Leysen's group or Suez for an acceptable industrial project and management structure for Generale de Belgique. Many observers said that in this scenario, Mr. De Benedetti would be likely to join forces with Mr. Leysen, who would retain control of 27.5% of Generale de Belgique.    --The commission allows the bid and the court rejects the capital increase: This would give Mr. De Benedetti his best chance at eventual victory. The bid could give him control of 33.6% of Generale de Belgique's share capital, if enough shares are still on the market. He has promised to sell anything over 25% to Belgian partners of his own choosing, but as the largest shareholder he could be an unstoppable force in the company.    --The commission allows the bid and the court approves the capital increase: Mr. de Benedetti still could amass about 27% of Generale de Belgique, enough to play an important role, but he would be the second-largest shareholder after Mr. Leysen's group with 49%. However, since Mr. Leysen's group is an ad-hoc gathering of shareholders with widely varying interests, some of them eventually could join Mr. De Benedetti's camp.    As the rulings approached, Generale de Belgique's shares yesterday soared on record volume on the Brussels stock exchange. The company's shares rose 16%, to close at a record 4,360 Belgian francs ($122.96). According to the official count, 3.3 million shares, equivalent to 12% of Generale de Belgique's capital, changed hands, though brokers cautioned that the volume figure was inflated by technical problems. One broker said many market participants expect trading to be suspended today. </TEXT></DOC>
