The Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve entered the market in force to help prop up the dollar, and the Bank of England joined the effort. The West German cental bank said it hadn't moved to buy dollars, but analysts in Washington speculated that it will move in today if the dollar falls further.    Despite the action, the U.S. currency reached another post-World War II low against the Japanese yen. It posted gains against some other major currencies, and it rebounded from its lowest point against the yen after the intervention. But traders expressed skepticism that central bank action will succeed in supporting the dollar against the Japanese currency.    Yesterday's action marked the first time the currency market has tested the six-nation accord since its signing in Paris last month. Previously, traders had been apprehensive about moving exchange rates substantially for fear that they would be caught short by government intervention.    In the accord, finance ministers of the U.S., West Germany, Japan, Britain, France and Canada all but promised to intervene to hold exchange rates in a narrow range, hinting strongly at one point that they had made detailed arrangements for concerted action.    Yesterday's intervention began when the Bank of Japan entered the Tokyo market after the dollar dropped to 148.85 yen. That breached the 150-yen barrier that investors appeared to believe was the limit of what central bankers would tolerate. Later in the day, the Bank of England took the unusual step of entering the yen-dollar market, apparently on behalf of the Bank of Japan, and the Fed entered the market in New York.    The Japanese central bank resumed its intervention in early Tokyo trading Wednesday. That action briefly pulled the dollar to about the 150-yen level, but it quickly retreated.    Although yesterday's intervention by the central banks wasn't on a large scale, it was plainly visible. Traders estimated that the Bank of Japan spent about $250 million during the day to buy U.S. dollars, while the Fed bought about $150 million and the Bank of England $100 million. Those figures weren't official.    However, Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson in Washington took the unusual step of publicly acknowledging the U.S. move, saying the Fed had acted &quot;in the spirit of the Paris accord.&quot;    A few minutes later, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, asked about the dollar's decline, told reporters: &quot;Enough is enough.&quot; Mr. Volcker has been warning for months that too large a decline in the dollar's value could be counterproductive.    Richard Witten, vice president, foreign-currency trading operations, at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. in New York, said the central banks' action indicated that the yen-dollar rate had &quot;hit some sensitive levels.&quot; But he said the six governments apparently haven't decided yet how much fluctuation against the West German mark they will accept.    Nevertheless, Mr. Witten said, &quot;What's important is that the three central banks acted in order, policing their respective time zones&quot; in the 24-hour global currency market. &quot;It was a display of concerted activity,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to believe the markets will respect this.&quot;    Geoffrey Dennis, international economist at James Capel andamp; Co., a London brokerage house, said the intervention showed that &quot;the Paris agreement isn't collapsing.&quot;    Other analysts speculated that the reason the intervention wasn't bigger was that central banks were saving their heavier ammunition in case it is needed today or tomorrow.    For most of the time since the six-nation accord, currency rates have remained relatively stable without official intervention. Only in the past few days has the yen begun to move substantially, and although yesterday saw another postwar low for the dollar on that front, it wasn't far below the U.S. currency's range of the past six weeks.    The dollar fell 0.7% yesterday to stand at 149.01 yen in late New York trading, compared with 150.03 in New York Monday. It had reached a low of 148.45 yen in intraday Tokyo trading.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for March delivery climbed $3.30 an ounce to $413.50 in moderate trading estimated at 2.3 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $413 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    In contrast to its performance against the yen, the U.S. unit firmed to 1.8225 West German marks from 1.8175, and the British pound slipped to $1.6113 from $1.6185.    In Tokyo yesterday, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will maintain &quot;close coordination with the major countries for the stability of exchange rates&quot; and take appropriate measures when necessary, including intervention, to keep the yen stable.    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said it would be difficult for Japan to tolerate a further depreciation of the dollar and that &quot;there is a clear agreement&quot; among the six nations to take joint action when necessary.    But traders expressed some doubt that intervention can stop the dollar's slide. Before the Fed's Mr. Johnson spoke, several currency dealers argued that the U.S. had largely abandoned the Paris accord with regard to supporting the dollar against the yen and predicted that the intervention ultimately will fail.    &quot;It now appears to the trading community that the (six-nation) agreement doesn't work, and even massive intervention at this point is probably going to have a limited effect,&quot; said Garrett R. Glass, vice president, foreign exchange, at First National Bank of Chicago.    Many traders said Treasury Secretary James Baker, with his remark last weekend that the Reagan administration has no target value for the dollar, is resuming his campaign for a weaker U.S. currency to pressure Japan to trim its huge trade surplus with the U.S.    &quot;The Reagan administration is irritated that the Japanese are not willing to open up their markets,&quot; Yani Budiman, vice president, foreign exchange, at Chemical Bank in New York, said.    James M. Pugh, a vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said U.S. officials &quot;are still locked up in the theory that if they drive the dollar low enough, it will correct the trade deficit.&quot;    But analysts in Washington said Mr. Baker has made similar statements before, apparently in hope of avoiding saying anything to influence the market. U.S. officials have said repeatedly that they aren't trying to push the dollar lower.    Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige told a House Banking Committee hearing yesterday that the dollar must depreciate further against currencies of newly industrializing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit.    However, Mr. Baldrige said he would oppose legislation aimed at forcing such an adjustment. The U.S. has been negotiating with the two Asian countries to get them to allow their currencies to appreciate further but has had only moderate success. Both nations traditionally have pegged their currencies to the dollar.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Tuesday, March 24, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
