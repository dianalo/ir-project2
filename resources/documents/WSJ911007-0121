Ltd., a unit of Rogers Communications Inc., announced ajoint study aimed at broadening the communications pathwaysavailable to businesses and, eventually, people at home.   Earlier this year, IBM announced a similar study withBellSouth Corp. that will look for ways to speed up thetelephone network. But IBM said it also wanted to explore thepossibility of using cable-television systems to letbusinesses send each other the huge amounts of data requiredfor, say, transmitting video.</LP><TEXT>   IBM said it was interested in doing the study with Rogers,the largest cable-TV provider in Canada, because it has beenespecially quick to switch to fiber-optic cables, which areneeded for high-speed transmission.   IBM and Rogers said their study will be done withbusinesses, because many businesses can tap directly into thecable company's fiber-optic network. Homes use copper wiresto tie them into the fiber-optic cables, and those wirescan't operate at anywhere near the speeds required for thesorts of tests IBM and Rogers will do.   Work is being done that could increase by a factor of 20or more the transmission capacity of copper wires -- both thetype used by cable television and the kind that telephonecompanies use. So homes will eventually get access to thesorts of services that businesses can get today. But it willtake a few years to sort out the technical issues.   The services being tested will include video conferencing.Many companies already do a bit of that, but transmissioncapacity still constrains the technology. Typically, theimage is heavily compressed before being sent, and when amoving image is decompressed it can have a distorted &quot;MaxHeadroom&quot; quality to it. IBM and Rogers hope they caneliminate those problems by providing enough inexpensivetransmission capacity that compression and decompression canbe minimized.   The technique that IBM and Rogers are using is an IBMtechnology known as Paris, which uses an increasingly popularmethod called packet-switching. Essentially, that involvesbreaking any transmission up into tiny packets. Each containsinformation that identifies what it is and where it's going,so the packets can be crammed together as they aretransmitted, eliminating the dead space that soaks up much ofa network's capacity.   At the moment, a telephone conversation gets a dedicatedchannel that no one else can use as long as it lasts. Butpeople conversing on the phone may actually be talking lessthan half the time, leaving a lot of idle capacity.</TEXT></DOC>
