It has embraced Arab brothers to the north in the new Union ofthe Great Arab Maghreb, which has yet to yield major economicbenefits, and engaged in a bloody dispute with the blacks ofSenegal, its southern neighbor and largest African trading partner.   One-third of Mauritania's people are of Arab-Berber extraction,known as white Moors. They dominate the government and most of theeconomy.   Another third are Haratines, or black Moors, mixed-racedescendants of slaves who adopted Berber customs, and the finalthird are blacks from the Senegal River region along the southernborder.   Even as it turns north to Algeria, Tunisia and Libya in hopes ofturning the Maghreb into a mini-Common Market, Mauritania lookswith new interest to the south, where two new Senegal River damshave created agricultural opportunities.   In large measure, disagreements about territorial and farmingrights along the border river are at the root of recent ethnicviolence in Mauritania and Senegal that has cost an estimated 260lives.   Tens of thousands of people were repatriated to their respectivehomelands by an air shuttle established at the height of thetrouble, which began with a minor border incident in April.   The dispute with Senegal comes at a time of political andeconomic change, both of which could be affected by it.   Mauritania, an Islamic state governed by the Military Committeefor National Salvation, is making its first tentative steps towarddemocracy. A few local elections were held in the past year andnationwide municipal elections are the next step.   Lt. Col. Maouya Ould Sidi-Ahmed Taya, the president, said in aspeech last month: ``An ephemeral democracy is not what we arelooking for. A healthy, efficient and durable democracy demands achange in our mentality and the eradication of ignorance and othersocial ills.''   A multiparty system and real parliamentary democracy do notappear likely in the immediate future.   ``Total democracy? That depends on the situation,'' saidInformation Minister Mustapha Ould Abedarrahman. ``The president isa man of his word. Each time the context allows development of thedemocratic process, it happens, but it is impossible to say howlong total democracy will take.''   The economy also is being restructured, by agreement with theInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About one-third ofthe government-owned companies are being sold and others are beingreorganized.   Restructuring combined with a 15 percent devaluation of thecurrency has had its consequences. Many public jobs were eliminatedand a government fund has been estabalished to help those affectedfind other work.   Mauritania is a desert country, and with the Senegal River damsin operation the government is giving land to any individual orcompany willing to develop it.   That has lured many white Moors never previously interested byagriculture, and black farmers resent the intrusion.   An unknown factor is the impact of the 50,000 Mauritaniansrepatriated from Senegal, where most were small shopkeepers.Resettling them will be a financial burden on the government, andtheir return also means loss of the money they had sent home.   Another question mark is fishing, which has overtaken ironmining as Mauritania's largest income producer. Nearly all thefishermen were Senegalese and nearly all fled, leaving the industryin a shambles and fish markets nearly empty.   Senegalese say a deep-seated racism among white Moors is at theheart of the conflict. Mauritania denies it.   In the 1960s, violence by southern blacks who feared furtherArabization was put down harshly and even discussion of race wasbanned, but problems continue in a nation that did not abolishslavery until 1980.   The government claims to have eradicated the African LiberationForces of Mauritania, a black opposition group, except for a few``troublemakers'' based in Dakar, capital of Senegal.   After an attempted coup by the group's military wing in 1987,two army officers were executed and others were jailed.   Fear of impending racial conflict has caused many blackMauritanians to flee Nouakchott for the southern border region,where they are a majority.</TEXT></DOC>
