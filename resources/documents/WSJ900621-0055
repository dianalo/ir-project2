His reassignment to the post of finance minister of thePersian Gulf oil power briefly boosted oil markets as sometraders assumed he would no longer be that sheikdom's chiefoil strategist. Others who follow the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, however, cautioned that themove might not be a repudiation of Sheik Ali's oil policiesso much as an extension of Mideast politics.</LP><TEXT>   Sheik Ali is being replaced by Rashid Salem Al-Omari, aKuwait University professor and chemical engineer who isvirtually unknown outside Kuwait.   A 44-year-old, London-educated economist, Sheik Ali hasbeen a vocal advocate of Kuwait pumping oil far above quotasassigned it by OPEC. Such &quot;cheating&quot; has bloated world oilsupplies and depressed prices. Yesterday, the continuingcrude glut briefly drove prices down to nearly $15 a barrelon the New York Mercantile Exchange. In the last hour,futures prices for July delivery rebounded somewhat to end at$15.30 a barrel, still off 35 cents on the day.   People who monitor OPEC internal affairs suggested the jobchange for Sheik Ali may mainly reflect efforts by Kuwait toaccommodate other major Middle Eastern oil producers intrying to stablize relations in the wake of the Iran-Iraqwar. Sheik Ali has been a thorn in the side of Saudi Arabia,Iran and Iraq, other powerful Persian Gulf producers who havegenerally supported OPEC's production-limiting quotas.   Indeed, a relaxed Sheik Ali, reached late last night athis beachhouse in Kuwait, certainly didn't express anydisappointment over his reassignment. On the contrary, hecalled it &quot;a new challenge.&quot; He added: &quot;I'm looking forwardto working with the domestic economy and Kuwait'sinternational investments.&quot;   Sheik Ali's reassignment is part of a cabinet shuffle thatsaw 11 of 20 positions change.   Whether or not Kuwait's oil policy changes is immaterialat the moment, anyway, traders say. Markets are currentlyawash in crude oil, with terminals and other storagefacilities almost overflowing. And that doesn't take intoaccount tankers full of oil afloat on the ocean. Since thebeginning of the month, the price of crude for promptdelivery has dropped by more than $2 a barrel. It could takeup to eight weeks to work off the excess oil.   It is understood that Sheik Ali's replacement, Mr.Al-Omari, is a close friend of Sheik Ali and that as a memberof the sheikdom's Supreme Petroleum Council until only twomonths ago, he is familiar with and supportive of Kuwait'spast oil policy.   Indeed, some who track OPEC believe that Sheik Ali, whohas been oil minister since 1978, will still play a majorrole in setting that policy. They insist he isn't beingtreated shabbily by his government, or being ousted as SheikAhmed Zaki Yamani was by the Saudi Arabian government in 1986after tangling with his nation's powerful King Fahd. SheikAli is similar in temperament and showmanship to SheikYamani.   At one time Kuwait's acting finance minister, Sheik Aliwill be handling a $100 billion investment portfolio in hisnew position. Kuwait, the most sophisticated of the PersianGulf countries, gets more than half its income from equityinvestments and has huge refining networks in other nationsthat offset some of the risks of crude oil markets.   Kuwait, along with the United Arab Emirates, hasflagrantly exceeded its OPEC quota since November even thoughSheik Ali then agreed to honor an allotment of 1.5 millionbarrels daily.   As a result of months of overproduction, Kuwait has beenfeeling pressure, particularly from Saudi Arabia, Iraq andIran. Saudi King Fahd has repeatedly called for all OPECmembers to honor their quotas. Iraq, which has been growingin military might since its war with Iran halted, has accusedKuwait of purposely driving oil prices down to keep Iraq'swar-torn economy in disarray.   Individuals who follow Middle Eastern politicaldevelopments said that during the past month Kuwait hasdiscussed a possible nonaggression pact with Iraq, and maynegotiate funds to help Iraq develop its oil productioncapacity. Removal of Sheik Ali from the high-profile role ofoil minister may be related to such moves, these sourcessaid.</TEXT></DOC>
