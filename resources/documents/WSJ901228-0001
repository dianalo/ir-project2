It is not one of the programs advanced by, say, theindependence movement of a Baltic state. It is the 1978constitution, a relic from the reign of Leonid Brezhnev.   That the Soviet Union's most venerable dissident shouldchoose to quote lines from her great oppressor issignificant. Ms. Bonner is not glorifying the regime thatstashed her away with her late husband, Andrei Sakharov, foryears of KGB-isolation in the town of Gorky. She is recallingBrezhnev to make a point: that the Soviet Union's currentleader, Mikhail Gorbachev, is actually moving away fromdemocracy and removing what vestiges of law do exist from theSoviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   To many Western observers, last week's resignation ofSoviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze seemed a shock --and one that foreshadowed political and military crackdown.To Ms. Bonner, the resignation was no surprise. &quot;In theSoviet Union,&quot; she says, &quot;the coup has already happened.&quot;   A visit with with the 68-year-old Ms. Bonner in herdaughter's suburban house is a lesson in how backwardWashington's Soviet policy seems from Moscow. This past monthPresident Bush has released at least $1 billion inagriculture credits in the name of aiding a hungry andreforming Soviet Union. Such bounty, Ms. Bonner says, &quot;mayimprove the situation of a very few people for a very shortperiod. But it will not improve the program for long-termchange -- at all.&quot; That the Soviet leader assigned the KGB todistribute the emergency food is proof of that.   What's worse, says Ms. Bonner, is that the West seemswilling to overlook Mr. Gorbachev's power-mongering in thehope that he will use that new power to end food lines anddomestic chaos. What America is really doing though, shethinks, is reinforcing &quot;Gorbachev's transition todictatorship.&quot; Ms. Bonner trained as a medical doctor, andshe doesn't want to promote suffering. Perhaps though, shesays, the world would do better to send food this winter tostarving Africa -- &quot;in my country, there isn't enough foodbecause the leadership doesn't want political reform.&quot;   With her daughter Tatiana interpreting and a photo of herlate husband framed at her right elbow, the bespectacled Ms.Bonner undertakes a careful review of Mr. Gorbachev'shalf-decade-long abuse of the law. Years ago, he widened hisown powers as president without a popular vote -- an abusewhich the West has honored, ironically, by referring to himas &quot;President Gorbachev.&quot; She points with hand and cigaretteto Article 72 of the Brezhnev constitution, which reads:&quot;Every union republic retains the right of free secessionfrom the Soviet Union.&quot; That bit of law was ignored lastspring, when Mr. Gorbachev refused Lithuania independence.(It may be, Ms. Bonner adds mischievously, that PresidentBush didn't protest because he didn't know about this part ofthe constitution). Now, Mr. Gorbachev has broadened hispowers again so that he controls all slots in his cabinet.   Ms. Bonner is taking this time off from a holiday tripbecause she thinks America's citizens just don't understandhow wrong their president is. The comparison may be rough,she says, but Mr. Gorbachev is like another leader who firstsided with democrats, then crowned himself emperor Napoleon.He has changed the Soviet constitution so often, she says,that &quot;his name should be in the Guinness Book of WorldRecords.&quot;   Ms. Bonner isn't really being fair to Mr. Gorbachev onthis last point -- Soviet leaders from Lenin to Chernenko hadalready fiddled their constitution some 100 times before Mr.Gorbachev got to it. Indeed, that she, the widow of AndreiSakharov, should be so vehement in an attack on MikhailGorbachev may at first glance seem odd. When he came topower, Mr. Gorbachev did much to improve the lot of politicaldissidents -- people who, like the Sakharovs, suffered KGBhounding, force feeding and persecution that lasted years onend. In the Sakharovs' case, Mr. Gorbachev actuallytelephoned the couple personally to announce the end of theirGorky exile. (The publicity-minded leader had a phoneinstalled especially for the event). Mr. Gorbachev has alsomoved forward on another major Sakharov goal-free emigration.   But there is consistency to Ms. Bonner's work. In the1960s, 1970s and 1980s, she andnuclear-physicist-turned-rebel tried to hold their regimeaccountable to its own laws -- however pointless this seemed.Sakharov died a year ago, and now she is doing the same thing-- alone. Mr. Gorbachev, she points out, may have madeconcessions on human rights, but he has not given such rightsany basis in law.   What should the West do next? Not, says Ms. Bonner, fearthat Mr. Shevardnadze's departure means the Soviet Union willstop supporting the U.S. on Iraq. &quot;Until he gets all the aidhe wants, Gorbachev will keep the same line and save face.&quot;Worry instead, she advises, about the civil strife --including violent military strife -- as Soviet republicsfight for freedom. Ms. Bonner herself thinks general strikesmay be the best way to spur change.   To fight for that change, this longtime emigration-rightscampaigner will herself return home to her Chkalova Streetapartment in Moscow. On her husband's birthday in May, sheplans a congress on the future of the Soviet Union. She isconcerned about the Soviet Union's future -- but does shethink Mr. Gorbachev and his regime will take back EastEurope?   &quot;Ha]&quot; says Elena Bonner in a lively moment and laughs.&quot;No.&quot; He and the military are too corrupt and too weak forthat. As for the republics at home, she thinks reversal isn'treally possible there either. &quot;No,&quot; she says again, shakingher gray ponytail. &quot;Things have gone too far.&quot;   ---   Miss Shlaes is deputy features editor of the Journal'seditorial page.</TEXT></DOC>
