At the end of 1988, a record 627,402 men and women wereincarcerated nationwide, but the most optimistic estimate of prisoncapacity said there was room for 566,898. While the prisonpopulation was increasing by 7.4 percent, the prison capacity wasincreasing by just 5.5 percent.   ``The 1988 increase translates into a nationwide need for morethan 800 new prison bed spaces per week,'' said the report writtenby Lawrence A. Greenfeld, corrections unit chief for thedepartment's Bureau of Justice Statistics.   The FBI, meanwhile, announced that serious crimes nationwiderose 3 percent between 1987 and 1988. The total number of violentcrimes reported to law enforcement agencies increased 5 percent,paced by a 7 percent jump in aggravated assaults in the last year,according to preliminary results of the 1988 Uniform Crime Report.   The report said motor vehicle thefts increased 11 percent fromlast year.   The 1988 crime index increased 4 percent in the Northeast andSouth but registered no change in the Midwest. The index _ thetotal number of crimes reported to state and local authorities _increased 3 percent in the West.   The report released Sunday said the 42,967 additional prisonersin 1988 were about 3,500 more than the number added during 1987.There had been a 7.2 percent hike in 1987 over the previous year.   The report attributed the increases both to the heightenedlikelihood that a serious offender will receive a prison sentenceand a 113 percent increase in the number of adults arrested fordrug trafficking or manufacturing.   And the Bureau of Prisons expects the increases to continue.   ``Obviously, the increased efforts of law enforcement to combatdrug problems (will hike the population), as well as the newsentencing guidelines under which inmates will be serving longersentences,'' said Greg Bogdan.   The federal prison population, which stood at 49,928 at the endof 1988, a 3.4 percent increase over the 48,300 at the end of 1987,is expected to reach some 83,500 by 1995, Bogdan said.   The report said that nationwide, state prisons were operating at7 percent to 23 percent over capacity, while federal prisons wereestimated to be between 33 percent and 72 percent over capacity.Bogdan said the federal prisons were operating at an average of 55percent over capacity.   During 1988, total state and federal prison capacities increasedby 28,000 to 31,000 beds, depending on how the variousjurisdictions rated capacities, the report found.   The report, which calculated prison population based both on allprisoners and on those sentenced to more than one year, called``sentenced prisoners,'' found that since 1980, the District ofColumbia and the federal prison system have more than doubled thenumber of sentenced prisoners.   Alaska, California, New Hampshire and New Jersey haveexperienced a threefold increase since 1980, when total prisonpopulations in those states were 29,725, to 1988 totals of 93,597.   The states that have more than doubled the number of suchprisoners since 1980 were Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii,Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York,North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Utah.   The incarceration rate, based on the number of people sentencedto more than one year in prison, reached 244 per 100,000 residentsnationwide. In 1980, the rate was 139 per 100,000.   The Western states had the highest increase in total prisoners,11.5 percent, while the Northeast had a 9.2 percent increase, theMidwest 8.6 percent, and the South 4.7 percent.   The 10 states with the biggest percentage increase in totalprison population from 1987 to 1988 were Rhode Island, 33.5percent; Colorado, 24.7 percent; New Hampshire, 17.5 percent,Michigan, 16.1 percent; California, 13.7 percent; Arizona, 11.1percent; Missouri, 10.8 percent; Kentucky, 10.6 percent; Nevada,10.1 percent, and Minnesota, 9.9 percent.   But the prison population actually declined in seven states, thereport found. The states with declines were South Dakota, down by10 percent; Washington, down 5.1 percent; Maine, down 2.3 percent;Tennessee and Alabama, down 1.7 percent; North Carolina, down 0.9percent, and West Virginia, down 0.2 percent.   Although men in prison still vastly outnumber the womenincarcerated, the number of women inmates increased at a fasterrate during 1988, 12.5 percent, than the men, 7.1 percent. Thenumber of women in state and federal prisons grew from 29,064 atthe end of 1987 to 32,691 at the end of 1988, while the number ofmen in prison increased from 555,371 to 594,711.</TEXT></DOC>
