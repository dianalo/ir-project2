Now, every morning, the phones are ringing off the hook with questions about overnight Midwest weather, crop situations and most of all, 'How are soybeans doing?' Soybean questions from every direction, from our own bond desk, from everyone.&quot;    He adds: &quot;You have to believe that some of that undecided stock market money is also coming into commodities markets.&quot;    In addition to more futures trading overall, there is a big swing away from financial futures toward agricultural commodities, many of which are in close supply-demand balances after years of surpluses. Midwest drought and strong exports, helped by a weaker dollar, have been supporting factors.    According to the Futures Industry Association, a trade group, eight futures markets had trading-volume increases of 50,000 contracts or more last month compared with May 1987. Of these, seven were commodities and only one was financial, the Canadian dollar. The big gainer was soybeans, with a 529,042-contract increase.    By contrast, of 13 markets with May-to-May volume decreases of 50,000 or more contracts, nine were financial. Futures on Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index had the biggest drop, 781,746 contracts.    This switch abruptly reverses a trend of recent years. Trading in futures on U.S. Treasury bonds, Eurodollars and the Sandamp;P 500 index alone accounted for 46.4% of all trading on U.S. futures exchanges in 1987 and 45% in 1986, according to the FIA.    Trading volume tells only part of a story. Another aspect of futures trading is the continuing interest of investors in a market. That's demonstrated by open interest, or the number of contracts remaining to be evened up by the sale or purchase of an opposite contract or the delivery of the commodity.    FIA figures show that open interest in soybeans last month was 77.6% higher than a year earlier. Volume increases in some other traditional commodities were also accompanied by higher open interest figures.    However, by this measure traders retain a high degree of interest in financial futures. While trading activity in the Sandamp;P 500 index contract fell 46% last month from the year before, open interest rose 4.5%. Eurodollar trading was about flat in the two months, but the open interest rose 52.5%. And while Treasury bond trading activity slipped slightly, open interest was up 50.3%.    According to James T. Kneafsey, president of Cambridge Financial Management, Cambridge, Mass., the strong open interest in financials partly reflects a switch from the more speculative-oriented traders to hedging-type participation.    &quot;From our own experience, we're seeing more midsized banks, for example, coming in to protect themselves against interest rate increases,&quot; Mr. Kneafsey says. &quot;Overall, I'd say that some stock market traders are putting at least a small percentage of their money into commodities. This is the portion of their assets they like to keep working in one way or another, especially in view of inflation fears.&quot;    One indication of the resurgency of agricultural commodities is the intense interest among investors of all kinds in the Commodity Research Bureau Index. Grains and oilseeds account for the largest segment, 23.8% of the index.    &quot;All day long, everyone wants to know what the CRB is doing, because of its agricultural bias,&quot; says Richard Hirsch, vice president and metals broker at Gerald Commodities Inc., New York.    A notable rebounder among the traditional commodities is sugar. Both trading volume and open interest are sharply higher. Sugar has a history of spectacular booms and busts. Currently, prices are strengthening after several years of being severely depressed. Traders say that if the European sugar beet crop, now in the growing stage, is damaged in any way, a strong rally would result.    Looking ahead to specific commodities this week:   Livestock and Meat   Cattle futures trading this week is expected to be dominated by this Friday's release of May feedlot figures, which are likely to show record or near-record levels of cattle being placed on feedlots, analysts said.    The drought in much of the West and Midwest is forcing many ranchers to take cattle off ranges and put them in feedlots, adding to the bulging supply. Prices for October cattle futures declined Friday, reflecting the expected increase in supply once the cattle put on feedlots this spring are slaughtered this fall, said Charles Levitt, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.    Cattle placed on feedlots in May are likely to total 3% more than a year ago, or about 2.1 million head, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill. Total cattle on feedlots will be about 7.8 million, also slightly above year-earlier figures, he said.    Energy   Traders will be watching the OPEC meeting in Vienna this week to see if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries takes any steps to reduce production -- something that over the weekend, seemed unlikely. On Friday the spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, tumbled 30 cents a barrel, to $16.75.    ---                      Trading Changes   Futures with volume chganges of more than 50,000 contracts                   CONTRACTS         CHANGE FROM MAY '87                      TRADED       ----------------------                     MAY '88       VOLUME         PERCENT Increases Soybeans          1,267,808      529,042        + 71.61% Crude Oil         1,205,266      267,939        +  9.38 Sugar (world)       474,693      195,836        + 70.23 Decreases Sandamp;P 500 index       899,735     -781,746        - 47.09% Treasury bonds    5,680,799     -537,387        -  8.64 DMark               334,977     -214,694        - 39.06   Source: Futures Industry Association</TEXT></DOC>
