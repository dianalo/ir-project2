(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Second WaveandM;Top executives at Palo Alto-based drug manufacturer Syntex Corp. recentlymade a surprising--some would say alarming--discovery after taking a hardlook at the use of PCs in the company's business units.andM;More than 25% of Syntex's employees already had PCs on their desks, and thenumber was growing as the company's PC-related spending ate up anincreasingly large share of its IS budget.andP;  But that wasn't the surprise.andO;Like Syntex, most large companies today are spending more and more on PChardware and software and associated technologies in support ofend-user-based applications.andP;  A recent study by management consultants Nolan,Norton andamp; Co., Lexington, Mass., estimates that on the average, corporationswill soon be spending 40% of their IS budgets on end-user technologies.andM;The surprise for Syntex was the realization that an increasing number ofapplications, written by its autonomous business units and running on its mixof Macs and IBM and Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  PCs, were becoming so central toits business that their failure could have a quick and direct impact on thecompany's bottom line.andP;  We're not talking spreadsheets and word processinghere.andP;  We're talking about custom PC-based systems that were doing everythingfrom monitoring and controlling lab procedures to compiling and communicatingvital drug testing information to government agencies such as the Food andDrug Administration.andM;The alarming part came when Syntex officials discovered that some of thosePC-based, critical applications were being built and implemented without muchconcern for the type of basic controls that most central IS types take forgranted.andP;  No standard development methodology or validation procedure.andP;  Nodocumentation.andP;  No backup, recovery, or security.andM;Syntex decided to do something.andP;  &quot;We started with the idea that [businessunit managers] must have the responsibility to be sure that the company isgetting the type of payoff it expects from these systems, and that they aredoing what they are supposed to be doing,&quot; explains Helen E. Peters, directorof office information services for the company.andP;  &quot;We have said, 'If youchoose to have this system developed by your own people, you, Mr.andO;Businessman, are going to be accountable for certain things.'&quot;andM;Before they were finished, Syntex's IS planners had made some dramaticchanges in the way the company manages end-user-based applications.andP;  A taskforce manages end-user-based applications.andP;  A task force consisting ofbusiness unit managers, PC managers, and central IS put together a set ofguidelines that defines company-critical applications and mandates controlsfor which business unit managers are responsible.andP;  And Syntex went further,abolishing its outmoded information center in favor of putting moredevelopment expertise directly into business unit IS organizations andencouraging them to involve end users, representatives from other divisions,and central IS in a team approach to developing and implementing PC and otherend-user-based systems (see &quot;Syntex's System Commandments&quot;).andM;&quot;We've had to take a more organized approach to end-user computing now thatwe're moving from counting beans with it to actually running the business onit,&quot; says Peters.andM;Syntex isn't the only large company trying to exert more coordination andcontrol over PC-based applications.andP;  As divisions, departments, and businessunits continue to increase PC spending and to build more company-criticalapplications around PCs, most companies are looking for a new and better wayto manage the development and support of those systems.andP;  They are putting anend to the often ad hoc, disjointed approach to PCs that evolved in the earlyto mid-1980s.andM;This second-wave approach to PC-based systems has companies insisting notjust that business units adhere to technical standards, but that they alsoconform to standard development methodologies and consciously link these newapplications directly to specific business objectives--not just to some vaguenotion of personal productivity.andM;&quot;We're now over the initial phase of end users saying, 'I need to have a PCto be somebody,'&quot; says Jim Miller, vp of MIS at of Richmond-based James RiverCorp. of Virginia, another company that is reevaluating how it manages PCs.andO;&quot;Now many end users are at the point of saying, 'We didn't get it quite rightthe first time around.'andP;  We're all realizing we've got to get a lot smarterabout how we manage PCs,&quot; remarks Miller.andM;The questions Miller and many others are asking are already profoundlychanging the roles, responsibilities, and challenges for every player in thePC game:andM;* Central IS, which in the past has played a spectator's role in PC-based,end-user computing, is now beginning to assert itself by setting standardsand, in many cases, actually controlling development, implementation, andsupport of company-critical, PC-based applications.andP;  The challenge for IS isto take a more active role without stifling what has become the valuablehallmark of the PC revolution--providing locally controlled, quick solutions.andM;* Business unit technical support groups are taking a much more active rolein planning and developing end-user-based applications with an eye towardcompanywide business objectives.andP;  Many companies are shutting downcentralized information centers and making a conscious effort to seedbusiness unit IS teams with seasoned professionals who are familiar with awide range of platforms and technologies, not just PCs.andM;* End users are being asked to take more responsibility for seeing to it thatthe applications they are demanding conform to companywide architectural andbusiness goals.andP;  And they are becoming active partners in team approaches toPC-based application development.andP;  Already, according to market researcherInput of Palo Alto, 50% of the companies it interviewed report that end usersare developing production systems.andP;  And half of those companies said endusers would be responsible for more than 25% of all their new applications in1988.andM;* PC vendors often are looking at longer selling cycles and an increaseddemand for service and support as many companies that are focusing oncompany-critical PC applications look to offload responsibility forwell-established task automation applications such as spreadsheets and wordprocessing.andP;  In some cases, vendors are seeing large companies temporarilyslow their acquisition of new PC hardware and software as they search for newmanagement approaches to company-critical PC-based applications.andM;Not coincidentally, many market watchers have begun to project a slowdown inwhat has in recent years been an ever more rapidly expanding PC market (see&quot;The Coming PC Slowdown&quot;).andP;  A recent survey of large corporations byDATAMATION and Cowen andamp; Co. actually identified a decline in PC units shippedin 1988 compared to 1987.andP;  It was the first time the annual survey showed adrop.andM;While most analysts are slightly more optimistic, most are predicting amoderating growth trend in 1988 and 1989.andP;  Many observers are attributing theflattening demand trend to user confusion over new and competing PCtechnologies and to PC prices that are being kept high by componentavailability and other factors.andP;  As memory shortages begin to ease, andlower-priced 80386SX-based systems become available later this year, followedby 80486-based systems sporting two-times-386 performance, many analysts arepredicting a return to 20 + % PC demand growth in 1990 (see &quot;Probing theRoots of PC Purchasing&quot;).andM;Others, however, say there's more to the PC demand pause than technologyalone.andP;  The drive by many large companies to find a new model for managingend-user-based systems, they say, also is having an effect on PC demand.andO;According to Art Benjamin, consultant and president of Toronto-based On-LinePeople, &quot;The first pause in the PC market came around 1984 when peoplestarted asking whether PCs were actually helping productivity or just turningexecutives into typists.andP;  Now we've been seeing another one, as peoplequestion not only whether they need OS/2 or DOS but as they try to understandhow to approach PC-based systems as they become more strategic.&quot;andM;Centralizing End-User ComputingandM;One large company going through that process right now is California RBOCPacBell.andP;  The San Ramon-based utility recently completed a pilot study aimedat understanding how its operating units manage its menagerie of PCs andend-user systems and how the company can better coordinate planning,development, and support.andP;  The study eventually led one large PacBelloperating unit in Alameda and Contra Costa counties to form a centralizedend-user computing center with responsibility for applications developmentand support.andM;The end-user computing center immediately took control of the operatingunit's data networking and office automation planning efforts and put on holdrequests from several work groups for PC- and local area network-based OAsystems.andP;  After a four-month study during which the center interviewed 20% ofthe operating unit's end users, it decided against going with PC-LANsolutions altogether, opting instead for a terminal-to-Unix system running ona new data-over-voice network linking the entire 2,500-person unit.andP;  Thenetwork is a PacBell-designed 9.6Kbps implementation called PBLan.andP;  The OAapplication will use commercial software running under Unix V version 3 ondumb terminals and a minicomputer from Arix Corp., San Jose.andM;According to Kris Zellars, computing manager for the PacBell pilot project,going with a terminal-to-Unix approach instead of a PC-LAN solution will notonly improve the business unit's control over end-user-based applications,but will also cut costs.andP;  Most users in the Alameda/Contra Costa businessunit still use dumb terminals, and the new system will allow them to pluginto new OA applications over existing phone lines.andM;&quot;A lot of people thought they really needed PCs and LANs, and they weren'tthat thrilled with the solution we came up with,&quot; says Zellars.andP;  &quot;But PCs andLANs get awfully expensive, and this way we can do everything a PC-LANapproach can do and stay within our overall architectural plan.&quot;andP;  Plans callfor the new end-user computing center to control other critical projects.andM;The PacBell study was prompted in large part by growing upper managementconcern with the cost of PCs and end-user-based systems.andP;  PacBell now hasabout 25,000 PCs installed.andP;  According to manager of portfolio managementBrian Miller, the company was worried not only about the cost of the hardwareand software but also about support costs.andP;  Nolan, Norton has estimated itcosts corporations about $18,000 per PC per year on average, with the largestchunk, 39%, eaten up by support costs.andM;PacBell management became convinced the company was paying plenty inunder-the-table support costs as end users sought help from de facto local PCgurus who were being distracted from their real jobs.andP;  &quot;There were lots ofhidden support costs that there was no way to quantify,&quot; says Miller.andM;Now PacBell hopes that other operating units, after studying the results ofthe Alameda/Contra Costa pilot project, will begin to make similar changes intheir approach to PC and end-user systems.andP;  But PacBell isn't mandating theapproach.andP;  For one thing, not all of its operating units are large enough torequire such a formalized coordinating function.andP;  And, for another thing,PacBell, like most companies, is hesitant to begin taking a top-down,authoritarian approach to end-user computing.andM;&quot;We've communicated the results of the study and said here are the keyfindings, but we're not dictating what they should do,&quot; says Miller.andP;  &quot;If wewere to do that we would still be treating it [end-user IS] as a uniqueventure.andP;  What we really want is for it to become integrated into thebusiness.&quot;andM;It's not unusual for end users and local support groups who are used to lotsof freedom in developing PC-based systems to rebel against more coordinationand control coming from IS or high-powered PC swat teams.andP;  &quot;Many end usershave gained much more technical sophistication and they're saying 'we justdon't need you anymore,'&quot; says Sarah Kaull, associate director of thePartnership for Research in Information Systems Management, a researchservice of the Index Group and Hammer andamp; Co., both of Cambridge, Mass.andM;End-user groups often are reluctant to give up control over their own ISdestinies.andP;  And they don't like the idea of a project schedule stretching outas IS and others get involved in development, which can happen.andP;  At MerrillLynch, for example, a massive trader automation project, running on 19,000386-equipped IBM PS/2s, was taken over by IS, and it is just now going intoits initial prototype phase, ayear and a half after the project wasinitiated.andM;&quot;Taking a more comprehensive approach to end-user computing does take moretime, and we've had to explain that to a lot of users who sometimes havefalse expectations,&quot; says PacBell's Zellars.andP;  &quot;Sometimes they do getimpatient with the process, though.&quot;andM;Many of those pushing for a second-wave approach to PC management say thelast thing they want is to put roadblocks up in front of end-user ISdevelopment.andP;  &quot;But it's a fine line,&quot; says E. Sheldon Gregory, informationservices customer support manager for San Francisco-based Bechtel Powercorp., which is also trying to take a more coordinated approach to managingits 2,720 Macs and IBM PCs.andP;  &quot;We don't want to try to control [end-usercomputing] too much, because then we'll lose it.andP;  But we do need to end someof the inefficiencies.andP;  We don't need people in each operating companyevaluating Lotus, dBase, and Oracle.andP;  And we don't need to be using lots ofdifferent user interfaces,&quot; according to Gregory.andM;Benefits of a Coordinated ApproachandM;Bechtel has formed a couple of task forces to develop companywide end-usertechnology standards and to identify and focus resources on company-criticalPC applications.andP;  The latter effort, called the Partnering Task Force, iscomposed of representatives from IS, each of Bechtel's operating companies,and companywide service sectors such as finance.andP;  The group is developingcritical PC-based applications in part to demonstrate to Bechtel's businessunits what can be accomplished with a coordinated approach to end-usersystems.andP;  &quot;MIS has a lot to bring to this arena, but we need to show valueadded.andP;  We need to have some winners,&quot; says Gregory.andP;  &quot;We're in a 'show me'environment.&quot;andM;So far, the Bechtel partnering group has developed two executive informationsystems.andP;  One custom EIS--for Bechtel's executive committee--based on theCommand Center software package from Pilot Executive Software, was rolled outin nine months.andM;Gregory says that soon Bechtel will turn the partnering task force into apermanent organization under IS to manage corporate planning and reporting ofend-user-based systems.andP;  In addition to EIS, the group will also focus itsattention on videotex and text management applications.andM;According to some IS executives pushing for a more coordinated approach toend-user computing, one key is to recognize that end users have gained plentyof expertise and experience since the PC revolution started in 1981.andP;  &quot;Wehave to realize that we [MIS] are not the only experts now,&quot; says Syntex'sPeters.andP;  &quot;The end users bring plenty of knowledge, and we have to recognizethat.andP;  In fact, we're finding the early PC adapters are learning some of thesame lessons that we in MIS learned years ago, like the need for backup andaudit trails.&quot;andM;While some corporations are attempting to set examples and gently convincebusiness units to cooperate with common, enterprisewide approaches toend-user computing, others are taking a more aggressive approach.andP;  Paper andpackaging manufacturer James River Corp., for one, is experimenting withgreater IS influence over critical PC-based applications development.andP;  Forexample, the company's MIS department is in the first phase of developing aPC-based production scheduling system that will tie together eight papermills and sales and customer service departments.andP;  Miller acknowledges thechanges he's making will, in many cases, cause PC-based developments to takelonger getting off the ground, but he says it's worth it.andM;&quot;Historically, our PC-based applications have been largely user-driven, withusers providing the expertise themselves,&quot; says Miller.andP;  &quot;But, in recentyears, there's been a ground swell of discontent from users.andP;  There's afeeling that there's been a proliferation of PCs but not a proliferation ofgood solutions.&quot; That is true particularly as end users get more ambitiouswith their PC-based applications.andP;  &quot;Many are reaching critical mass andturning to the MIS group for help,&quot; says Miller.andM;If getting IS more involved and enforcing a more disciplined approach toPC-based applications development means projects take longer to getimplemented, that may not be all bad, says Miller.andP;  &quot;The premise has beenthat if you're going slow, you're doing something wrong.andP;  I'd want to testthat idea.andP;  I'm not sure it's right,&quot; says Miller.andP;  &quot;Formalizing the processmay end up helping users more than slowing things down.&quot;andM;That's not to say that Miller is pushing for IS to become an authoritarianforce over all end-user-based projects.andP;  In fact, rather than disbanding itsinformation centers as some companies are doing, Miller is pushing to upgradetechnical expertise at the company's three information centers so they cantake on development projects involving a wide range of technologies, not justPCs.andP;  James River is adding development experts who have experience withenvironments such as VM, 3270 data transfer, and COBOL, as well as its386-based PCs, at its three information centers in Richmond, Norwalk, Conn.,andO;and Oakland, Calif.andM;&quot;We want to get users away from the idea that all they need to know about arePCs,&quot; says Miller.andP;  One of the problems, he says, is that users often tend toreach for the same solutions, regardless of the problem.andP;  &quot;If all you've gotis a hammer, everything looks like a nail,&quot; he says.andM;Trading Autonomy for CoordinationandM;While some end users may have misgivings about trading autonomy for morecoordination and control, many seem to see the value of a new approach toPC-based systems.andP;  One such user is John Taylor, manager of sales systems inSyntex's sales organization.andP;  He says the biggest impact on him has not beenSyntex's focus on development disciplines such as security for end-usersystems.andP;  The biggest change, he says, has been in the push toward a teamapproach to new PC-based projects.andP;  &quot;It's definitely becoming more common asit becomes more successful,&quot; says Taylor.andM;Taylor recently was involved in developing a critical, PC-based inventorycontrol system designed to satisfy FDA regulations on drug companies'distribution of free samples to physicians.andP;  The planning and development wasdone by a team from central IS, sales tech support, technical people fromother business units, and end users.andP;  The consensus approach created somedisagreements between the various factions and added about 12% to the overalldevelopment time.andP;  &quot;But,&quot; Taylor says, &quot;we now have a more comprehensivedesign that is more flexible to changing business needs.andP;  People need torealize that the greater good is to end up with a better system.&quot;andM;The focus on new approaches to critical PC-based projects is also changingthe ground rules for vendors in the PC market, particularly those sellingsoftware solutions.andP;  They face longer selling cycles.andP;  And sometimes it's notobvious who in an organization they should be selling to as their customerstake more coordinated, team approaches to PC-based applications.andM;According to James A. Perakis, president and CEO of PC-based financialreporting software maker IMRS Inc. of Stamford, Conn., &quot;Just a couple ofyears ago, the primary motivation for our customers was to break from MIS.andO;They wanted to do their own systems in their own way.&quot;andP;  But that's allchanging fast.andP;  &quot;Now when we go into a sales situation, very often MIS isright in there as part of the evaluation team, along with the end-userorganization--usually finance--and a consultant.andP;  Usually we spend timetrying to figure out who's taking the lead role.andP;  The surprising thing isthat today, as often as not, it's a young MIS guy, under 30, throwing hisweight around at these meetings,&quot; says Perakis.andM;As corporations turn their attention more to company-critical, PC-basedapplications, vendors also are being asked to take on more of a service andsupport role, particularly when it comes to more generic applications such asword processing.andP;  One large company, Rochester-based Eastman Kodak Co., issaid to have recently asked vendors to bid on a project to manage most of itsgeneric, standalone PC applications.andP;  Businessland, Centel, and IBM are saidto be among the bidders.andM;One vendor focusing on that kind of business is Corporate Software of Boston.andO;Besides selling software packages for PCs, Corporate Software will, for anadditional charge, coordinate a user's PC hardware and software portfolio andsupport activities.andP;  &quot;Lots of companies would rather just write a check forthat and focus their attention on more strategic, custom applications,&quot; saysCorporate Software marketing vice president Vince Kelly.andP;  Not all PC vendorssee the new-wave, coordinated approach to company-critical applicationssignifcantly changing their market or slowing growth.andP;  Mike Swavely,marketing vp for leading IBM PC-compatible vendor Compaq Computer Corp., saysmost of Compaq's hardware business will continue to come from taskautomation-type applications, not company-critical, business automationprojects.andP;  And the responsibility and control of projects will continue tocome from the departments and business units, Swavely says.andP;  To the extentCompaq is preparing for a new approach to company-critical applications, itis through new products such as the Extended Industry Standard Architecturebus the company is promoting as an alternative to IBM's Micro-ChannelArchitecture.andM;Other observers, however, have very little doubt that large companies arechanging their approaches to end-user computing rapidly and that it meansmore coordination and control, not less.andP;  Analysts such as Nolan, Norton, infact, see the new wave of PC development approaches as only part of along-term trend that will, in the 1990s, see companies using end-usercomputing to alter their basic business organizations fundamentally andreceiving 10-fold returns on their PC investments, not just the 10% to 20%most see today.andP;  Companies such as James River are planning for that today.andO;According to Miller, the company has begun studying what kind of basicorganizational efficiencies it could expect if end-user-based systems couldprovide workers more complete, practical information.andP;  &quot;We could get by withtwo levels of employees.andP;  One guy to run the mills and one guy to run themachines,&quot; says Miller.andM;Right now, however, IS planners at most large companies seem to have theirhands full just catching up with their own business units.andP;  &quot;We've alreadytaken that leap of faith and bought lots of PCs,&quot; says Bechtel's Gregory.andO;&quot;Now we're just trying to figure out what's going on out there with al ofthem.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
