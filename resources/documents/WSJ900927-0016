Banks and thrifts would pay insurance premiums based onthe amount of their lending risk, would transfer riskieractivities to uninsured affiliates, and would tightenunderwriting standards for real estate loans. Depositorswould be limited to a particular number of insured accounts,and pension funds and other big depositors would face limitedinsurance coverage.</LP><TEXT>   Robert Glauber, undersecretary of the Treasury,characterized his testimony before the Senate BankingCommittee as a &quot;progress report&quot; on the Bush administration'sdeposit-insurance study. Nonetheless, &quot;there are a number ofspecific areas where we have begun to lean towards specificconclusions,&quot; he said.   The complex issue has been pushed to the front burner inCongress by outrage over the savings-and-loan bailout, andanxiety over the strained bank insurance fund. There is anincreasing appetite on Capitol Hill to tackle depositinsurance and bank activities in one big legislative packageearly next year.   &quot;We have to put this on the fast track, and clear thetrack,&quot; said Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D.,Mich.). He said Congress is awaiting a signal from PresidentBush that the issue will be a priority next year. &quot;If he iswilling to engage, we can really move this along,&quot; Sen.Riegle said.   The plan didn't specifically address some problematicquestions, such as whether to abandon the &quot;too big to fail&quot;doctrine. Under that practice, banking regulators haveinsured all deposits at large, failed banks, even accountsthat exceed the $100,000 deposit-insurance limit.   Even that policy appears headed for revision. Both Sen.Riegle and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman of theHouse Banking Committee, have opposed protecting alldepositors at large banks. Federal Reserve Board ChairmanAlan Greenspan and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ChairmanWilliam Seidman have both expressed uneasiness with it.   &quot;That's very important for shaping the rest of thedeposit-insurance reform proposals,&quot; said Robert Dugger,economist for the American Bankers Association. For one,changing that policy would help make small banks morecompetitive with large banks, which alone benefit from thetoo big to fail policy.   The administration is keeping mum on how it would carryout its other ideas. Those matters, such as which bank powerswould be restricted to affiliates, and how to keep track ofthe number of insured accounts, are relegated to thefull-blown study on deposit insurance.   But altering those practices would change the industryradically. Investment managers are already bracing themselvesfor a narrowing of coverage for big pension funds, which arecurrently protected up to $100,000 for each beneficiary.Those deposits are likely to flee to insurance companies,which sell competing instruments. &quot;We anticipate some sort ofcurtailment on exisiting coverage,&quot; said Steve Finegan ofMorley Capital Management, an investment manager.   Shifting riskier loans to affiliates and subsidiarieswould probably cause an industry contraction -- at least inthe banking sector operating with deposit insurance. Theadministration thinks that would be fine. &quot;The problem isthat the amount of funds attracted into the banking systemmay be far greater than the amount that can be deployedwisely in traditional banking assets,&quot; Mr. Glauber said.   Also, interest rates on loans generated at the bankingaffiliates are likely to rise above current rates, becausethey will be funded from higher-cost sources than bankdeposits.   Overall, lawmakers and industry lobbyists were somewhatsurprised at how easily a general consensus appears to beforming. &quot;I'm really pleased to see things are furtheradvanced than I thought they would be even a month ago,&quot; saidLee Peckarsky, a lobbyist for the National Council of SavingsInstitutions. &quot;To the extent that Congress focuses on this inSeptember, it sets the agenda for an early January start.&quot;   Meanwhile, however, both Congress and the administrationrefuse to propose specific funding for the savings-and-loancleanup, which will run out of cash by the end of the year.The agency needs at least $20 billion to get through nextApril, or else insolvent thrifts will remain open andaccumulate losses. The Treasury has drafted legislation forthree different funding proposals, but Congress is waitingfor the Treasury to endorse one.   Mr. Glauber said any choice is fine. &quot;There is noambiguity,&quot; said Mr. Glauber. &quot;We need money before Congressgoes out.&quot;   He also urged Congress to quickly pass legislationremoving the ceiling on deposit-insurance premiums and givingregulators greater flexibility with the insurance fund. TheHouse has already passed a version of this legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
