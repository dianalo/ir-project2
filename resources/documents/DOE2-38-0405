<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-38-0405 </DOCNO><TEXT>Evaluation of thermodynamic stability in tungsten alloys of refractoryinterstitial phases (carbides, borides, nitrides) was conducted. Amountof excess deoxidizer, necessary for their stabilization in sinteringatmosphere in 500-3500 K range and for the series of partial oxygen pressureswas calculated. Possibility of complete and partial HfC, HfB/sub 2/,HfN stabilization was supported experimentally. Formation of HfO/sub2/, ZrO/sub 2/ (or HfO/sub 2-x/C/sub x/) and W/sub 2/B/sub 5/, WC (orWC/sub 1-x/O/sub x/) was established.</TEXT></DOC>
