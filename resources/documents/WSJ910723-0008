Other over-the-counter stocks fell as insurance sharesweakened and some companies reported weak earnings.</LP><TEXT>   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.56 to 494.99, an 0.51%loss. The Nasdaq Insurance Index fell 0.92% amid growingconcern about the strength of insurance companies. OTC volumedropped sharply to 127.9 million shares from 176.9 millionFriday. Declining stocks outpaced advancers, 999 to 843, but99 shares climbed to new highs as 30 fell to new lows.   Cetus was the day's most active OTC issue, as more than2.2 million shares changed hands after the Emeryville,Calif., biotechnology concern agreed to merge with Chiron,also based in Emeryville, in a stock swap valued at about$660 million, or about $18.24 for each Cetus share. Under theplan, Chiron would swap 0.3 of its share for each Cetusshare.   Cetus also plans to sell its polymerase chain reactiontechnology, a diagnostic technology based on DNA, to itsjoint venture partner, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., for $300million plus royalties of as much as $30 million.   Chiron tumbled partly amid concern about the near-termimpact of the merger on its earnings, analysts said. CetusChief Financial Officer R. Jefferson Works told Dow JonesProfessional Investor Report that the combined companies willreport a charge after the merger is completed &quot;in excess of$100 million,&quot; and possible &quot;substantially in excess&quot; of thatfigure.   &quot;I think people aren't quite sure what Chiron is getting,&quot;PaineWebber analyst Linda Miller added in an interview. ThePCR technology sold to Hoffmann-La Roche was considered bymany investors to be Cetus's &quot;crown jewel,&quot; she explained,and some investors might be disappointed that Chiron won't beinheriting that technology.   Cetus also brings to the table a number of geneticallyengineered treatments still in the research phase, but notyet near final testing, approval and marketing, she added. &quot;Ithink if {Chiron} is going to pay a lot of money foropportunity, people would like that opportunity to be nearerterm,&quot; she said. Investors may also be wary that Chiron willinherit the headaches associated with Cetus's interleukin-2cancer drug, which has had a rough time getting a blessingfrom professional advisers to the Food and DrugAdministration, she added.   Longer-term, however, &quot;it's a tremendous deal,&quot; MichaelGordon, manager of the Fidelity Select Biotechnology Fund,said in an interview. &quot;I think {Chiron} is getting years ofresearch technology at Cetus for a good price,&quot; Mr. Gordonsaid. He added that the combined companies will have about$600 million in cash, including the Hoffmann-La Rochepayment, after they merge.   Among other biotechnology stocks, Genetics Institute fell2 to 31, a move that Ms. Miller said could be attributed tonervousness that Chiron will be backing a rival technologyinherited from Cetus. Both Genetics Institute and Cetus aredeveloping macrophage colony stimulating factors, or M-CSF,which may be used in treating fungal and infectious diseases,among others.   Other biotechnology stocks were mixed: Amgen rose 1/4 to138 3/4; Centocor added 3/8 to 35 3/8; Xoma climbed 1 to 245/8; and Synergen was unchanged at 38.
