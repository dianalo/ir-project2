The analysis, encompassing data from trials involving75,000 women world-wide, adds credence to recommendations inboth the U.K. and the U.S. that women who have had surgeryfor breast cancer should be treated routinely with tamoxifenas well as chemotherapy.</LP><TEXT>   Tamoxifen, produced by Imperial Chemical Industries,blocks the cancer-stimulating action of the female sexhormone estrogen. British cancer specialists have propoundedits use in all breast cancer patients for several years.American doctors, however, were slow to begin using tamoxifenbefore 1990, when a federal &quot;consensus conference&quot; noted thatthe drug reduced recurrences of breast cancer by a third.   The new analysis found that chemotherapy plus tamoxifenafter surgery for earlystage breast cancer increased thenumber of patients who were alive 10 years later by 12% overthe patients treated with surgery alone. The proportion ofpatients who survive 10 years after surgery alone wasn'tgiven because the analysis involved trials encompassing awide variety of patients with differing potentials for cure.   However, recent trials in the U.S. found that four yearsafter diagnosis 80% to 84% of the women treated withtamoxifen or chemotherapy after surgery were alive and freeof cancer, compared with 70% to 77% treated with surgeryalone.   The so-called meta-study, an analysis of 133 treatmenttrials dating back to the 1950s, is scheduled for publicationin the next two issues of the British medical journal Lancet.Its results, released here yesterday, confirm what manyspecialists already know about the benefits of hormonaltherapy, particularly with tamoxifen.   The study concludes that for women over 50 -- more thanthree-quarters of all breast-cancer patients -- chemotherapyenhances the 10-year survival rate by 5%, compared withhaving no treatment beyond surgery. A two-year course oftamoxifen increases the 10-year survival rate by 8% abovesurgery alone. Longer use of tamoxifen, which has few sideeffects on middle-aged women, increases survival ratesslightly more.   &quot;A lot of people, especially in the U.S., are gettingchemotherapy, when, in fact, hormonal treatments, or a mix,are more effective,&quot; says Richard Peto, a statistician withthe Imperial Cancer Research Fund and chief author of thestudy.   But U.S. doctors, who use chemotherapy more often thandoctors in most of Europe, aren't likely to change theirtreatment patterns, says Andrew Dorr of the National CancerInstitute in the U.S. Most don't read academic journals likeLancet, he says, and don't understand how metastudies aregenerated.   The meta-study may have more impact on the treatment ofbreast-cancer patients younger than 50. For them, the studyshows, the surgical removal of ovaries yields a slightlyhigher improvement in the 10-year survival rate thanchemotherapy, when both treatments are compared to having notreatment at all -- 11% for ovary removal compared with 10%for chemotherapy. (Ovaries are the primary producers ofestrogen in pre-menopausal women.)   Extrapolating from the data, Mr. Peto estimates thatcombining ovarian surgery with chemotherapy would raise thesurvival rate to 12% or more above the no-treatment standard.   &quot;I was one of the people who wrote papers in the early1980s on how ablation would never work,&quot; says I. CraigHenderson, the newly named chief of oncology at University ofCalifornia at San Francisco. &quot;I was wrong.&quot;   In addition, Dr. Henderson says he was &quot;amazed&quot; to seehormonal therapies yielding 10-year survival rates on a parwith and better than chemotherapy.   Another surprise in the data, researchers say, is thattamoxifen appears to be just as effective as chemotherapy intreating post-menopausal women infected by cancer types notthought to be receptive to hormonal therapy. These so-calledreceptor-negative cancers have generally been treated withchemotherapy, the study says, but tamoxifen turns out to beequally effective.   &quot;So if only one is to be given, tamoxifen might bepreferred,&quot; write the editors of Lancet, in an editorial tobe published with the study.</TEXT></DOC>
