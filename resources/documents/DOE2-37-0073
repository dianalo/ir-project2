The first, calledHeuristic Spanning, creates parallelism by investigating different areasof the combinatorial search space. It is meant to replace the high-temperatureportion of Simulated Annealing which, as shown, is the part of the algorithmthat chooses the general location of each cell. The Max-Span algorithmis presented, which chooses a spanning set of seed cells for the initialpartitioning step of the Min-Cut placement algorithm. The Min-Cut algorithmis run on separate processors, each using a different seed cell, afterwhich the interim placement with the best cost function is chosen forthe low-temperature annealing. The low-temperature portion of SimulatedAnnealing is left largely intact and sped up by a technique called SectionAnnealing. The placement is geographically divided and the pieces areassigned to separate processors. Significant speedup over uniprocessorsimulated Annealing, giving high-quality VLSI placement of Standard Cellsin a short period of time.</TEXT></DOC>
