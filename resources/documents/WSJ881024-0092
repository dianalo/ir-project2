News of the plan by RJR's chief executive officer to take the company private for $17.6 billion, creating a huge new debt load for the tobacco and food giant, sent the market value of RJR bonds plunging as much as 17% late last week.    It is the latest example of the perils of owning investment-grade corporate bonds. While takeovers and leveraged buy-outs can be great for stockholders, they frequently are disastrous for bond investors because they can involve massive new debt that causes the value of existing bonds to plummet. Some RJR bonds last week tumbled as much as 15 points, or $150 for each $1,000 face amount.    Even veteran bond traders had assumed that RJR bonds were safe because the company seemed too big for a leveraged buy-out. Now, money managers say the news points up more clearly than ever the need for investors to take steps to minimize the growing risks that their high-grade bonds could suddenly be transformed into junk.    &quot;What a mess. This is ridiculous,&quot; says George J. Collins, president of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., a Baltimore-based investment management firm. &quot;The bondholder gets taken to the woodshed and there is absolutely no recourse.&quot;    Many money managers say the best thing for individual investors to do is avoid the industrial corporate bond market altogether and instead buy Treasury bonds. &quot;We're primarily in Treasurys because we figure nobody is going to try to LBO the government,&quot; said John Rust, a vice president at Wood, Struthers andamp; Winthrop.    Treasury bonds offer only slightly lower returns than high-grade corporate bonds. The spread, often less than one percentage point, isn't enough to make corporate bonds worth the added risk, many investment advisers say. Also, Treasury bonds are much easier to buy and sell in a hurry than corporates, and investors don't have to worry about &quot;call&quot; provisions that allow companies to redeem the bonds long before the maturity date on the issue.    Still, the corporate market does present attractions for investors who realize the risks and take precautions, some analysts say. &quot;I like the corporate market,&quot; says Mr. Collins of T. Rowe Price. &quot;I like the extra yield you get on corporate bonds. But you can't play this game when things like this happen. Even if you do the best research in the world, it doesn't help you. So you've got to make changes in your strategy.&quot; The T. Rowe Price New Income Fund now has a record 65% of its $900 million in Treasury securities, with the rest in corporate issues. For investors determined to venture into the corporate bond market, professional investors say there are ways to reduce the risk that they will take a bath if their company becomes the target of a takeover or is involved in a leveraged buy-out.    THINK BIG: Buy bonds of only the very largest industrials, such as International Business Machines Corp., Exxon Corp., or Du Pont Co. Despite the mammoth size of recent proposed megadeals, analysts argue that there still are companies that are too big for takeovers or buy-outs. One drawback, though, is that these bonds are considered so safe that they offer only slightly higher yields than U.S. government-backed issues.    DIVERSIFY: Don't sink large amounts of money into any single corporate industrial bond, or any single industry. Mutual funds and unit investment trusts are especially good ways to achieve diversification for individual investors. &quot;Try to diversify so that you're not putting all your eggs in one company,&quot; says Robert B. Lamb, a professor of finance and management at New York University.    STAY SHORT: Stick to short-term industrial bonds. The shorter the maturity, the less volatile the price of the bonds. &quot;It might be smart to buy three-to-five-year bonds,&quot; says Mr. Collins of T. Rowe Price. &quot;They are going to mature so soon that you're not going to take as big a hit&quot; if the company is involved in an buy-out or takeover.    BUY UTILITY BONDS: The theory here is that regulators wouldn't permit utilities to issue massive amounts of new debt that would decimate balance sheets. That logic sounded convincing to many investors who bought utility bonds late last week. But some analysts contend that utilities have many potential problems. &quot;Both presidential candidates are on record as favoring legislation to correct the problem of acid rain emissions, which could impose a significant cost on coal-burning utilities,&quot; says Marty Fridson, a principal at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    BUY JUNK BONDS: Sellers of these high-yield, high-risk bonds insist that companies that issue such bonds already are so highly leveraged that they are much less vulnerable to takoevers or leveraged buy-outs.    Not quite, replies James Grant, publisher of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. Some companies with junk bonds have undergone restructurings involving even more debt. The sellers' argument is like saying &quot;you should build a house next to a tannery so they can't build a tannery next to your house,&quot; he says. &quot;Recently, on occasion, you have woken up to find another tannery on the other side of your house.&quot; Mr. Grant adds, &quot;I don't think you're being paid enough for the risk&quot; of owning junk bonds.    BUY STOCK: If you buy an industrial company's bonds, buy the stock, too. Even though the prices of the bonds may drop on a takeover or leveraged buy-out, the stock price should rise. Last week, for example, RJR's stock soared more than 38% on news of the proposed buy-out. A similar idea is to buy convertible bonds, which are bonds that can be converted into a company's stock.    COVENANTS: Look for companies that offer issues with covenants specifically protecting bond investors. Lawyers predict investors soon will force more companies to offer these protections, such as the &quot;poison put,&quot; which allows investors to sell their bonds back to the company at face value in the event of a change of control.    Unfortunately, protective covenants aren't all that common and frequently are extremely difficult even for professional investors to understand. Also, analysts say a poison put designed to protect bondholders from a hostile takeover might well offer zero protection in the event of a friendly takeover or a leveraged buy-out.    Some other warnings:   --Don't rely too heavily on corporate bond ratings. &quot;Rating agencies can't see the future any better than anyone else,&quot; says James S. Tisch, executive vice president at Loews Corp. &quot;Remember, a rating is good only for today. It's not good for the entire life of the bond.&quot;    --Watch out for companies that are rumored in the press to be takeover candidates. Among the factors that can make a company an attractive candidate are large cash flows, an unusually low stock price, or a company with several divisions that could easily be sold separately.    --Be especially wary of companies whose managements start talking about &quot;enhancing shareholder value,&quot; warns Margaret Patel of Boston Security Counselors. That phrase often is code for a corporate restructuring that involves heavy borrowing.    ---             Safeguards for Corporate Bondholders    Investment advisers say these are some moves that can reduce the risks for corporate bondholders in a takeover or restructuring   Diversify   -- Consider mutual funds and unit investment trusts -   Buy   -- Bonds with protective convenants, like &quot;poison puts&quot;   -- Utility bonds   -- Convertible securities   Avoid   -- Bonds issued by companies with several divisions that could be sold separately   -- Bonds issued by other companies that are likely takeover or restructuring candidates</TEXT></DOC>
