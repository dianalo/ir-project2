WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUNSSUM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NATO's military planners face acurious task. As member nations extend a hand of friendship toMoscow, the planners are mapping a new strategy for defendingagainst the Red Army.   The Soviets remain Europe's biggest military power.   Emerging details of the new NATO strategy show an emphasis onsmaller, more flexible integrated armies and on rapid deploymentcapabilities to areas that might be threatened. Nuclear weaponswill play a smaller role.   The strategy, ordered by NATO leaders at a London summit inJuly, remains largely under wraps.   It assumes that Soviet forces do not pose the threat they didunder Mikhail S. Gorbachev's predecessors, but emphasizes that theWestern alliance must remain strong in case of a sudden change inpolicy by Moscow.   ``NATO is not on the rocks,'' said Gen. Hanns-Henning vonSandrart, who commands more than half a million NATO troops incentral Europe.   The military threat may have lessened but ``nobody says that asa consequence of what happens in the East we should abandon NATO,''the German general told reporters recently in his home near hisheadquarters in this southern Dutch town.   The new planning comes amid unprecedented changes.   Next week, NATO and the nations of the disintegrating WarsawPact are to sign a treaty in Paris limiting battle tanks, armoredcombat vehicles, artillery, combat planes and assault helicoptersacross Europe.   Under the treaty, the 16 allies of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization will remove 8,000 pieces of military equipment, the 16Warsaw Pact nations about 100,000.   Deployments on each side are likely to ultimately fall below the20,000 tanks, 30,000 armored vehicles, 20,000 artillery pieces,2,000 combat aircraft and 6,800 attack helicopters allowed underthe treaty.   Moscow has already promised to withdraw all its forces from thesoil of its former allies by 1994.   And because of changed deployments in Eastern Europe, NATOplanners believe the warning time the alliance would have of anattack from the East is now days or weeks, rather than the minutesit counted on previously.   The new defense strategy will reflect a reduced reliance onnuclear arms.   The United States will not modernize its short-range Lancemissiles and nuclear artillery shells, leaving only aircraftcarrying free-fall bombs in Europe. Chances of deploying a newair-to-surface missile are seen as slim.   In the alliance's new plans, no NATO commander will feel thechanges more than von Sandrart.   The German general commands eight army corps, 560,000 troops, onwhat was once Armageddon's doorstep: the area including Germany,Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands that was expected to bearthe brunt an armored Warsaw Pact assault.   But his eight corps in NATO's central region - three German, twoAmerican and one each from Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands -have become anachronistic.   ``I can see the central region going down to four, maybe fivecorps, within three years,'' von Sandrart.   The remaining corps - 300,000 troops - would each comprise threemultinational divisions of 25,000-odd troops. Most would be``guard'' forces. Others would be division-strength, ``rapidreaction forces.''   Von Sandrart said, ``There is a strong case for moremultinational integration of forces.'' Currently, NATO operates a``layer cake'' of national forces, deployed side-by-side.   With more multinational integration of forces would come agreater integration of arms, a goal that has long eluded NATO.   The alliance's members make four different main battle tanksthat fire different shells.   Half a dozen make communications systems unable to ``speak''with each other. None are compatible with NATO's own communicationssystem.   Key to NATO's new strategy remains the notion, enshrined in theNATO treaty, that an attack against one ally ``shall be consideredan attack against them all.''   Military planners do not see the end of the Cold War underminingNATO's relevance as an outfit for military and politicalconsultations, one that links the United States to Europe and is aguarantee against a military mobilization in any one country.   While the allies agree events outside NATO's borders, notably inthe Middle East, affect their interests, the alliance is unlikelyto engage in joint operations, although the issue is under debate.   ``That is a highly political question,'' said von Sandrart.``First our political masters will have to come to grips withthat.''   At any rate, NATO's new strategy does not foresee an``out-of-area'' presence of NATO troops under allied command.   Joint out-of-area operations do not enjoy much support in NATOcapitals, said Simon Lunn, deputy secretary general of the NorthAtlantic Assembly, a consultative body of lawmakers from the NATOnations.</TEXT></DOC>
