Baker III calledon Arabs and Israelis today to show a more conciliatory attitudetowards each other's interests as a means of beginning a ``seriousnegotiating process.''   ``Let the Arab world take concrete steps toward accommodationwith Israel _ not in place of the peace process, but as a catalystfor it,'' Baker said in a speech to the American Israel PublicAffairs Committee, a group that lobbies for U.S. support of Israel.   He called on Arabs to end the economic boycott of Israel, torespect Israel's right to membership in international organizationsand to ``repudiate the odious line that Zionism is racism.''   At the same time, Baker issued an appeal to conservativeelements in Israel, calling on them to ``lay aside, once and forall, the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel.''   Baker said that Israeli interests in the West Bank and GazaStrip can be accommodated in a settlement based on U.N. SecurityCouncil resolutions spelling out framework for a peace settlement.   He called on Israel to forswear annexation of occupiedterritories, to stop settlement activities in these areas and toallow schools to reopen.   He asked Israelis to ``reach out to the Palestinians asneighbors who deserve political rights.''   In a similar vein, Baker urged Palestinians to ``reach out toIsraelis and convince them of your peaceful intentions.   ``You have the most to gain from doing so, and no one else canor will do it for you,'' he said. ``And no one is going to`deliver' Israel for you.''</TEXT></DOC>
