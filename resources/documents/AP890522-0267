Wright's lawyers will argue that the two most serious sets ofcharges brought against their client by the House ethics committeeshould be dismissed because the panel, reacting to a new moralclimate, has stretched the rules beyond their original intent.   ``We are hoping for a clear interpretation that the ruleshaven't changed on us,'' Wright said.   But Wright's lawyers concede such motions are routinely deniedand give the speaker less than even chance of winning a pre-emptivedismissal of the charges.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Americans would accept an array of encroachmentson their lives to help clean up the environment, such as a ban onaerosol cans and mandatory household recycling, a poll has found.   The Media General-Associated Press survey of 1,084 adults foundbroad perceptions that environmental pollution is on the rise, andthat government, businesses and average Americans are not doingenough to combat it.   Three-quarters of the respondents said laws against pollution inthe United States are too weak, and majorities favored urgentgovernment action, no matter what the cost, to protect the nation'sdrinking water.   Large majorities also supported strict pollution controls at allmajor oil facilities and at oil- and coal-burning power plants,even if those measures would raise the price of oil, gasoline andelectricity.</TEXT><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   The Alaska oil spill, last summer's beach pollution and reportsof global warming have pumped new life into the Americanenvironmental movement, which is reaping a bitter windfall witheach new catastrophe.

Although environmentalists insist they aren't gloating overExxon's misfortune, they can't hide a sense of vindication.   ``This spill has just really presented an opportunity,'' saidLee Keller Reis, a National Wildlife Federation spokeswoman. ``Youhate to say, `We told you so,' but it's a way to make a point.''</TEXT><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three months after the last Sovietsoldiers left, the government is showing increasing confidence itcan ultimately force Moslem guerrillas and their supporters _especially the United States _ to talk peace.   Western countries had predicted the mujahedeen, or Islamic holywarriors, would overwhelm the Afghan armed forces within weeks orat least a few months of the Soviets' departure on Feb. 15.   Although these predictions have not come true, the United Stateshas rebuffed proposals by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev fora mutual cut-off of weapons and stepped-up efforts for a cease-fire.   ``They say, `We should give the mujahedeen more time,' but theyhave had time and they have nothing to show. They have no power.They can only fire rockets,'' Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said.   He said President Bush should accept that the guerrillas willnot bring down the Soviet-backed government and that a negotiatedpeace is the only policy consistent with the principles espoused bythe United States.</TEXT><DATELINE>TISBURY, Mass.
