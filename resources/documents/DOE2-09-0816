Air samples were taken while the dentistand assistants used mercury amalgams. Nitrous-oxide was in use for overthree hours. The air-sampling results revealed a range of nitrous-oxideconcentrations in the room air from 30 to 220 parts per million (ppm).Mercury concentrations ranged from nondetectable to 0.009ppm, well belowthe evaluation criteria of 0.05ppm. The author concludes that a healthhazard from excessive exposures to nitrous oxide exists, but mercurylevels pose no health hazard in the clinic. The author recommends thatthe ventilation system should be adjusted each time nitrous oxide isgoing to be used. Routine maintenance checks should be performed on allanesthetic and suction equipment. The installation of a large fan onthe roof of the building is suggested. Patients, particularly children,should be watched so that they do not play with the face mask duringthe administration of nitrous oxide.</TEXT></DOC>
