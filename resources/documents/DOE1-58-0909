Using differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray diffractometry,it is shown that this effect is due to the activation of a surface crystallizationprocess associated with out-diffusion of zirconium and subsequent formationof a Zr{sub 2}Fe+{alpha}Zr crystalline layer. The kinetics and bulk crystallizationare analyzed in detail for the etched samples using the concept of thelocal value of the Avrami exponent.</TEXT></DOC>
