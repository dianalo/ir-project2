According to Bank Rate Monitor, the national average forcredit-card interest rates climbed to 18.94% as of Sept. 3from 18.69% a year ago, while the rates that banks payconsumers on one-year certificates of deposit fell more than200 basis points to 5.81%.</LP><TEXT>   Although the higher rates are causing some cost-consciousconsumers to pay back debt more quickly, banks overall arereaping one of their largest credit-card profit margins since1982.   &quot;The banks need to support their bottom line and they'redoing it with wider spreads on credit cards,&quot; said RobertHeady, editor of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla.,newsletter that tracks bank interest rates.   Another reason for higher interest rates has been anincrease in acquisitions of credit-card portfolios of banksthat charged lower rates. The acquiring company then oftenraises the rates.   Household International Inc., a Prospect Heights, Ill.,consumer financial services concern, for example, raised thecredit-card interest rates of customers to 18.9% from 14.9%after it acquired the credit-card portfolio of Dime SavingsBank.   &quot;Banks are lining their pockets by charging theircustomers some of the highest credit-card interest rates inhistory,&quot; said Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holdersof America, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group in Herndon,Va. The rates have risen &quot;while other interest rates -- homemortgage rates, auto loan rates, the prime rate and theFederal Reserve discount rate -- have dropped to nearly thelowest level in a decade,&quot; he added.   Bank executives say they need to keep credit-card interestrates high to offset increases in delinquencies and decreasesin outstanding card balances, which are raising the costs ofrunning their credit-card businesses.   &quot;While cost of funds has been lower than expected for manyin the business, delinquencies, operating expenses andcharge-offs have all risen to a greater extent,&quot; said RobertK. Hammer, an investment banker who acquires credit-cardportfolios for banks.   Indeed, delinquencies have risen 30% so far this year,representing 5.8% of accounts, while receivables, or loanspayable to a bank by a cardholder, have declined 2.5% fromlast year, according to RAM Research, a Frederick, Md., bankcard research concern.   Some smaller banks, trying to compete in an increasinglysaturated market, are lowering credit-card rates to all-timelows. For example, Simmons First National Bank in Pine Bluff,Ark., recently lowered its credit-card interest rate to10.5%.   But the vast majority of the top ten credit-card issuers,including Citicorp, charge on average about 19.8%. Oneexception has been Chemical Banking Corp., which switched toa rate that is tied to the prime rate. The holder of itsChemPlus Visa credit card, for example, is charged 16% forbalances outstanding.   &quot;During these hard credit times, our attention has beenholding on to and minimizing attrition of our existingcustomer base,&quot; said Edward A. O'Neal, vice chairmanresponsible for Chemical's credit-card business. &quot;We're notgrowing in terms of accounts, but at the same time we'reholding on to more customers.&quot;   Credit-card profits have been one of the few bright spotsfor banks, many of which have been hurt by bad real estateloans and other investments.   A spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association,releasing preliminary results from a survey of 200 seniorbank officers, said a vast majority of the banks don't expectto see any changes in rates and fees for the rest of theyear. The rates are expected to be &quot;stable,&quot; she said.</TEXT></DOC>
