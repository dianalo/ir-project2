By a 99-0 vote, the Senate on Friday approved a measure aimed at preventing future accidents, improving efforts to clean up those that do occur, and making sure that shippers and oil companies pay for them. The day before, the House Public Works and Transportation Committee passed a similar bill by a voice vote.    The major difference between the two versions is one that has helped kill oil-spill measures in the past: whether federally imposed limits on polluters' liability should supersede state laws. The Senate measure would allow state liability laws to take precedence over federal limits. Seventeen states, including Alaska, have laws that don't limit oil spillers' liability. The legislation that cleared the House panel would override state laws.    But two powerful forces could combine to overcome the conflict on that issue this year. One is the vivid image of the oil-covered beaches and wildlife of Alaska's Prince William Sound, coated with some of the 11 million gallons of thick crude that spilled from Exxon Corp.'s Exxon Valdez tanker ship in March.    The other is the resolve of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, the prime mover behind the legislation. &quot;I have been active on this for nine years,&quot; he said, &quot;and I do not wish to make it my life's work.&quot;    The Senate measure that was cleared would raise significantly from current levels the federal liability limits for oil shippers and producers, and require the president to adjust them every three years to keep pace with inflation. Liability for spills from tankers, for example, would rise to $1,000 per gross ton of ship from $150. Spillers guilty of gross negligence, willful misconduct or failure to observe navigation or safety laws would face unlimited liability.    During consideration of the Senate bill, senators were eager to take tough stands against potential oil spillers. By a voice vote, they adopted a provision offered by Sen. Pete Wilson (R., Calif.) that would remove all limits on liability for spills from offshore drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. Also by voice vote, they approved an amendment from Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) that doubles the proposed liability limits on oil tankers and barges.    In addition, lawmakers narrowly rejected attempts to remove liability limits for all spills and to require double hulls on new tankers.    To ensure immediate action after a spill, the Senate-passed bill would set up an industry-financed fund that could provide as much as $1 billion for each accident for cleanup activities and compensation to those who sustain damages. Those ultimately found liable for spills would have primary responsibility for paying for the cleanup and damages. Money from the fund would be used to cover damages exceeding their liability. The total cost for the Exxon Valdez spill is estimated at more than $1 billion.    The money would come from a tax of 1.3 cents a gallon on crude oil and imported petroleum products that was approved in 1986, contingent upon enactment of oil-spill legislation. The House Ways and Means Committee recently approved an increase to three cents a barrel.    Responding to the circumstances of the Exxon Valdez spill and its aftermath, the legislation also would set minimum requirements for crew on oil-tanker bridges, require periodic and random alcohol testing of tanker crews, allow the transportation secretary to suspend a mariner's license for alcohol abuse, and establish regional oil-spill response teams.    Also, the Senate adopted legislation that would establish a citizens' council with a high-profile advisory role in the affairs of the Valdez, Alaska, oil terminal operated by Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. The proposal now goes to the House, where Alaska sponsors are optimistic about its adoption.    While the council won't be able to veto or mandate actions by the terminal's operators, the legislation provides funding that allows the council to hire scientific and technical staff to conduct studies to determine the impact of terminal operations on fisheries and the environment, and the effectiveness of oil-spill response plans. </TEXT></DOC>
