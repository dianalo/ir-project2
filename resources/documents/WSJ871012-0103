But whether they can permanently enhance their leverage over the currency markets will depend on their success in achieving greater economic policy cohesion.    Treasury Secretary James Baker took the latest step to improve coordination earlier this month; he proposed that the Group of Seven countries partly base their policy planning on a new indicator showing the relationship between major currencies and a &quot;basket&quot; of representative commodities, including gold.    By mentioning &quot;gold,&quot; Mr. Baker sent tremors through economic circles, reviving talk of a return to the Bretton Woods system, under which exchange rates were rigidly linked to gold. But Mr. Baker wasn't proposing a gold standard. Instead, he wants to strengthen the so-called &quot;indicator&quot; system for policy coordination that has supported this year's international efforts to reassert control over exchange rates.    Since the February Louvre accord, the major industrial countries have succeeded in running the first managed exchange rate system since the Bretton Woods system gave way to free-floating rates in the early 1970s. Convinced that market volatility has unduly hampered government policy-making, the Group of Seven countries -- the U.S., Canada, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan and West Germany -- have managed to keep the dollar within a secret target range, probably extending from roughly 135 yen to 155.    Mr. Baker believes that the system has proved highly manageable, and that its costs -- central bank intervention of around $70 billion earlier this year and increases in interest rates -- have so far proved tolerable. But he realizes that lasting stability must rest on greater policy coordination.    Thus, the Group of Seven members have been trying to fine-tune a set of indicators to guide their policies. They have pledged to put their economic policies on a coordinated track involving greater demand-led growth in Germany and Japan, lower budget deficits and export-led growth in the U.S., and enough of a gap between U.S. and foreign interest rates to keep cheaper dollars flowing here.    But the record on coordination is much more mixed than on exchange-rate stability. Germany, in particular, has resisted significant stimulus, citing inflation fears, and Japan is worried about prices as well.    Mr. Baker was the main architect of the &quot;indicator&quot; system, battling skepticism from markets and other governments. He is determined to make it his main international legacy after leaving office, probably after the summer presidential primaries.    His commodity-basket proposal was designed to tell critics in Bonn, Tokyo and the markets that a stable dollar and low inflation are compatible goals that can be handled by the indicator system, if countries will go along.    Even with more policy coordination, it won't be easy to achieve greater exchange rate stability. Things have changed dramatically since 1944, when the delegates at the Bretton Woods monetary conference tied currencies to gold. Back then, Washington dominated the world economy. There were no well-developed currency markets. And most of the capital flows were still in the hands of governments.    That world is gone. Now governments lack the funds to overwhelm a determined market trend. And Washington must govern the world economy by consensus with powerful officials in Germany, Japan, Britain, France and -- increasingly -- the &quot;newly industrialized&quot; countries like Korea.    Yet the floating-rate system that replaced fixed exchange rates in 1973 has proved so troublesome for governments that change is under way. Even the free-market Reagan administration has found it frustrating to deal with a shifting, faceless collection of currency traders who often benefit from instability and turn remarks by politicians into big swings in currency values.    &quot;Baker came in two years ago, very intelligent but new, and he saw that it was totally out of control,&quot; says Alan Stoga of Kissinger Associates. &quot;So he's saying there must be a better way to run a railroad. They're not trying to return to a fixed dollar, but they want more control. Traders make money from volatility. But governments need stability.&quot;    Britain's Chancellor of the Exche quer Nigel Lawson says that &quot;the belief that markets would provide a stabilizing influence . . . has not been borne out. In particular, we have seen wild gyrations in the dollar that have clearly not been a reflection of economic fundamentals.&quot; Mr. Lawson advocates turning the Louvre accord into a formal new international monetary system, the third since World War II, which he called &quot;managed floating.&quot;    Robert Hormats of Goldman Sachs says: &quot;What we have in place now is the outline of the third major postwar system, a system of managed rates based on the judgment of major players, aided by a few indicators.&quot;    But it will take all of Mr. Baker's formidable political skills to keep the system functioning in the face of foreign resistance. Twice this month, Germany's central bank chief, Karl Otto Poehl, has let interest rates begin to creep up over U.S. protests. And this week he said he doubts the commodity-basket idea could be a practicable system for monetary policy.    Before the big governments can succeed in controlling the markets, they will have to make more progress in getting their own act together. That is the greatest test for Mr. Baker's legacy. </TEXT></DOC>
