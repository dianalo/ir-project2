But employers insist they have tens of thousands of jobsavailable with no one to fill them. They want the government torelax strict immigration laws so that foreign laborers can help fuelthe robust economy.   ``There just aren't enough people to go around,'' said Ian Wade,chairman of the 78-member Retail Management Association, of theBritish colony's 5.7 million population.   Hong Kong's economy expanded 13.5 percent in 1987 and anestimated 8 percent last year, sending the unemployment ratetumbling to a negligible 1.3 percent for the three months ending inNovember. Jimmy McGregor, who represents business interests in thelocal Legislature, estimates that at least 100,000 more workers areneeded.   Business leaders say the shortage endangers future growth andforces up wages, fueling inflation, which neared 8 percent lastyear. The government, however, says bringing in foreigners who donot have special skills would deprive local workers of their fairshare of Hong Kong's economic success and could create numeroussocial problems.   The shortage is felt in virtually every industry, from grittyconstruction sites to the plush corridors of the five-star touristhotels.   Employers are taking a wide variety of measures to cope.   The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, short nearly 300 tellers as thehectic Lunar New Year holiday approached in early February,attempted to relieve the strain on its employees by giving away twoPorsche cars in a contest open only to customers who used automaticbanking machines, spokeswoman Fiona-Jane Kennedy said.   The new Marriott Hotel angered competitors by instituting a48-hour, five-day work week, instead of the industry standard of sixdays.   Kent Maury, the Marriott marketing director, said the five-dayweek was designed to give his hotel a ``competitive edge'' inattracting staff. ``It's done exactly what we wanted,'' he said,adding that 3,800 people applied for 1,100 openings.   Meanwhile, hundreds of Hong Kong manufacturers have establishedplants across the border in China's Guangdong province, where wagesare relatively cheap, land is available and labor is abundant.   The critical construction industry has been particularly hard hitby the scarcity of labor, with the vast majority of projects failingto make completion deadlines, according to Gerrit J. de Nys, chiefexecutive of Shui On (Contractors) Ltd.   The situation is exacerbated by laborers who are not working ashard, aware of how valuable a commodity they have become, de Nyssaid.   ``If you yell and shout at them ... they won't even say goodbye.They'll just walk off the job.''   Shui On now tends to focus more on public sector projects becausethe government seems less likely to demand penalty payments for theinevitable delays, de Nys said.   Compounding the personnel headache faced by de Nys and others isthe loss of thousands of key professionals who are emigrating beforeChina takes over the colony in 1997.   While there appears to be no quick fix to stem the emigrationflow, businessmen believe the labor shortage could be relieved ifthe government relaxed immigration restrictions that generally allowthe entry of only specially skilled workers and maids.   Nine major business associations have joined forces and arepreparing a report on their labor needs in hopes of persuading thegovernment to ease up on immigration.   McGregor, who is involved in the project, said the governmentcould tap China for labor to do short-term contractual work.English-speaking workers needed in service industries could bebrought in from the Philippines, Malaysia and possibly Thailand, hesaid.   So far, the government has refused to budge.   Secretary for Education and Manpower Ron Bridge said in aNovember speech that importing workers who do not have specialskills ``would be extremely damaging to our labor relations'' andreduce the incentive for employers to upgrade technology, managementand productivity.   Further, he said, the ``supply of housing, medical and socialservices and our transport facilities would be stretched eventighter,'' and Hong Kong could face international accusations ofexploiting cheap labor.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs Feb. 21</NOTE></DOC>
