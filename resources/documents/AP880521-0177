The Rev. Ray Barnett, head of the Seattle-based Friends in theWest, said Fadlallah issued the statement Saturday after the twomade contact.   ``Despite the limited means I have in this respect, I willinvest all my energies in this direction,'' Fadlallah said in thestatement.   ``I have sought to close this file with all the means that Ihave and I am still working on exerting pressure to reach ahumanitarian solution to this problem,'' he said, withoutspecifying who he was exerting pressure on.   An aide to Barnett gave a copy of Fadlallah's statement inArabic to The Associated Press.   Barnett, of Vancouver, Canada, arrived in Lebanon Friday,seeking to deliver a petition to Fadlallah asking him to help freethe hostages. Speaking in a telephone interview from his hotel inChristian east Beirut, he declined to comment on how he establishedcontact with Fadlallah.   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is the umbrella organization forpro-Iranian groups believed holding most of the 18 foreign hostages_ including nine Americans _ in Lebanon.   The longest-held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.   In another development, a freed French hostage was quoted Sundayin a London newspaper as saying a British television newsman and aNorthern Irish teacher are held in Lebanon by the pro-IranianIslamic Jihad.   Jean-Paul Kauffmann would not, however, say how he knew thatJohn McCarthy, 31, and Brian Keenan, 36, were held by the ShiiteMoslem extremist group, The Sunday Times reported. They bothdisappeared in April 1986, but no group has claimed responsibilityfor their kidnapping.   Kauffmann was released in Beirut May 4 with two other Frenchhostages after nearly three years in captivity.   The newspaper also said Kauffmann revealed that until October1986, McCarthy was held in a cell next to an American hostage. Buthe said he wanted to keep the American's name secret to avoidputting him or McCarthy in danger.   Fadlallah started his statement by expressing how deeply movedhe was by the hostage issue.   ``I am stirred by this issue which is a humanitarian onealthough it has been placed within a political framework,'' he said.   In an earlier interview Saturday, Barnett had said he did notknow how the petition, with 40,000 signatures from variouscountries, would be delivered.   An aide to Barnett said the petition was not actually deliveredto Fadlallah but that the Shiite leader considers it as good asdone.   He said Fadlallah showed deep concern and thanked all those who``made this great effort.''   Barnett, 50, has met Fadlallah twice on previous trips to westBeirut over the last two years.</TEXT></DOC>
