(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Negotiators for Caterpillar Inc. and theUnited Auto Workers union remained locked in labor talks past aSunday strike deadline as 17,500 blue-collar workers in five statesawaited word from the bargaining table.   No strike was called as both sides tried to find common groundand avoid a walkout.   ``There has been a little bit of movement, and that smallmovement is enough to warrant continuing the talks,'' said KarlMantyla, UAW spokesman at the site of the talks in a Bridgeton,Mo., hotel near St. Louis.   ``We're going to remain flexible to see if that leads us in thedirection we want to go. Negotiations are continuing. We can'tpredict how long it's going to go,'' he added.   Mantyla described the talks as an ``hour-by-hour situation'' andsaid the labor contract was not extended past the 9:30 a.m. Sundaydeadline.   Caterpillar spokesman Mark Polzin said he had nothing to add toMantyla's statement.   The contract between Peoria-based Caterpillar and the UAWoriginally was scheduled to expire at midnight Sept. 30. But thetwo sides agreed to extend talks indefinitely pending the outcomeof talks between the union and Deere andamp; Co.   Deere and the UAW settled without a work stoppage when the twosides agreed to a three-year contract that included a 3 percent payincrease, boosts in retirement benefits and greater job security.   It was the first general pay raise for Deere workers since 1981,and the union hoped to use the Deere contract as a pattern for itsCaterpillar talks.   Caterpillar workers were poised to strike factories andwarehouses at 12 cities in Illinois, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Coloradoand Tennessee.   Negotiations started Aug. 4 between the union and Caterpillar,the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment with58,800 employees in several countries.   Union representatives had asked the company for merit pay, 100percent job security, a reduction in overtime and the recall of1,000 laid off UAW members. They also sought an early retirementprogram and an increase in pension benefits for those on earlyretirement.   The union reportedly was seeking a three-year pact and a 3percent wage increase in each year of the contract.   In past talks Caterpillar officials have sought more flexibilityin job assignments and scheduling, as well as a simplifiedgrievance procedure and new guidelines for overtime.   The average factory worker at Caterpillar earns $14.61 an hour,or $30,388 annually for a 40-hour week. With fringe benefits,Caterpillar calculates its current labor costs at $26 an hour peremployee.   In 1986, negotiations between the two sides were extended fourtimes before a settlement was reached.</TEXT></DOC>
