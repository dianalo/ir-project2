CERCLA has since been amended by the SuperfundAmendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (``SARA'') and is implementedby Executive Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987). CERCLA requiresthat the NCP include a list of national priorities among the known releasesor threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminantsthroughout the United States, and that the list be revised at least annually.The National Priorities List (``NPL''), initially promulgated as AppendixB of the NCP on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658), constitutes this listand is being revised today by the addition of 23 sites. Based on a reviewof public comments, EPA has decided that 13 of these sites, which are subjectto the corrective action authorities of Subtitle C of the Resources Conservationand Recovery Act (``RCRA''), meet the listing requirements of the NPL.This rule also adds 5 RCRA sites on which no comments were received, andadds 5 no-comment sites which filed RCRA permit applications as a precautionand are not subject to RCRA corrective action authorities. Finally, today'saction removes 27 RCRA sites from the proposed NPL. EPA has reviewed publiccomments on the removal of these sites and has decided not to place themon the NPL because they are subject to the subtitle C corrective actionauthorities of RCRA, and do not, at this time, appear to come within thecategories of RCRA facilities that EPA considers appropriate for the NPL.Information supporting these actions is contained in the Superfund PublicDocket.Elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4> is another final rule that adds 70 sites, including11 Federal Facility sites, to the NPL and drops 4 sites from the proposedNPL. These two rules result in a final NPL of 981 sites, 52 of them inthe Federal section; 213 sites are proposed to the NPL, 63 of them in theFederal section. Final and proposed sites now total 1,194.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>The effective date for this amendment to the NCPshall be November 3, 1989.

Introduction</ITAG>BackgroundIn 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. sections 9601-9657 (``CERCLA'' or the ``Act''),in response to the dangers of uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous wastesites. CERCLA was amended in 1986 by the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct (``SARA''), Public Law No. 99-499, Stat. 1613 <T3>et seq.</T3> To implement CERCLA, the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (``EPA'' or ``the Agency'') promulgated the revised National Oiland Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP'') 40 CFR Part300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180) pursuant to CERCLA section 105 andExecutive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP, furtherrevised by EPA on September 16, 1985 (50 FR 37624) and November 20, 1985(50 FR 47912), sets forth guidelines and procedures needed to respond underCERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,or contaminants. On December 21, 1988 (53 FR 51394), EPA proposed revisionsto the NCP in response to SARA.Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the NCPinclude ``criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatenedreleases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedialaction and, to the extent practicable taking into account the potentialurgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action.'' Removalaction involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response toreleases or threats of releases on a short-term or temporary basis (CERCLAsection 101(23)). Remedial action tends to be long-term in nature and involvesresponse actions which are consistent with a permanent remedy for a release(CERCLA section 101(24)). Criteria for determining priorities for possibleremedial actions financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA areincluded in the Hazard Ranking System (``HRS''), which EPA promulgatedas Appendix A of the NCP (47 FR 31219, July 16, 1982).On December 23, 1988 (53 FR 51962), EPA proposed revisions to the HRS inresponse to CERCLA section 105(c), added by SARA. EPA intends to issuethe revised HRS as soon as possible. However, until EPA has reviewed publiccomments and the proposed revisions have been put into effect, EPA willcontinue to propose and promulgate sites using the current HRS, in accordancewith CERCLA section 105(c)(1) and Congressional intent, as explained in54 FR 13299 (March 31, 1989).Based in large part on the HRS criterion, and pursuant to section 105(a)(8)(B)of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, EPA prepared a list of national prioritiesamong the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances,pollutants, or contaminants througout the United States. The list, whichis Appendix B of the NCP, is the National Priorities List (``NPL''). CERCLAsection 105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually.A site can undergo CLA-financed remedial action only after it is placedon the NPL as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2), and 300.68(a).An original NPL of 406 sites was promulgated on September 8, 1983 (48 FR40658). The NPL has been expanded since then, most recently on March 31,1989 (54 FR 13296). The Agency has also published a number of proposedrulemakings to add sites to the NPL most recently a special update of twosites on August 16, 1989 (54 FR 33846).EPA may delete sites when no further response is appropriate, as providedin the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(7). To date the Agency has deleted 28 sitesfrom the NPL, most recently on September 22, 1989 (54 FR 38994) when theCecil Lindsey site, Newport, Arkansas, was deleted.Of the sites in this rule, 30 were originally proposed in the first fourupdates to the NPL,\1\<NOTE/> prior to publication in 1986 of an expanded policy for listingon the NPL certain categories of sites regulated under the Resource Conservationand Recovery Act (``RCRA'') (announced on June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21054) andfurther amended on June 24, 1988 (53 FR 23978)) (the ``NPL/RCRA policy'').The 39 sites were identified as possibly subject to the Subtitle C correctiveaction authorities of RCRA, and therefore possibly subject to the NPL/RCRApolicy. Because the public had not been afforded notice and opportunityto comment on the application of this policy to these sites, the Agencyreproposed the sites (13 to be listed, 26 to be dropped) on June 24, 1988under the amended policy and at the same time solicited comments on theproposed actions (53 FR 23978). Nine RCRA sites proposed in NPL Updateandplusmin;7 (53 FR 23988, June 24, 1988) and one site proposed in Updateandplusmin;8 (54 FR 19526, May 5, 1989) are also being added to the NPL inthis final rule; these sites were proposed under the NPL/RCRA policy, butreceived no comments. In addition, one RCRA site proposed in Update andplusmin;7is being dropped in this final rule because of a change in its RCRA status.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Update andplusmin;1 (48 FR 40674, September 8, 1983), Updateandplusmin;2 (49 FR 40320, October 15, 1984), Update andplusmin;3 (50 FR 14115,April 10, 1985) and Update andplusmin;4 (50 FR 37950, September 18, 1985).EPA has carefully considered all the public comments submitted on the 39previously proposed RCRA sites, both in response to the original proposalof the sites, as well as in response to the application of the NPL/RCRApolicy to the specific sites. The Agency has made some modifications inthis final rule in response to those comments. In addition, the Agencyis dropping one proposed Update andplusmin;7 site in response to commentsconcerning the site's RCRA status.The Agency has responded to a number of major comments on the policy forlisting RCRA sites in this notice. Responses to more site-specific listingpolicy issues, as well as comments on HRS scores, are presented in the``Support Document for the Revised National Priorities List_Final RuleCovering Sites Subject to the Subtitle C Corrective Action Authoritiesof the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, October, 1989'' which isa separate document available in the Headquarters and Regional public dockets(see Addresses portion of this notice).This rule, together with the final rule appearing elsewhere in today's<T4>Federal Register,</T4> results in a final NPL of 981 sites, 52 of themin the Federal section; 213 sites are in proposed status, 63 of them inthe Federal section. Final and proposed sites now total 1,194.EPA includes on the NPL sites at which there are or have been releasesor threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.The discussion below may refer to ``releases or threatened releases''simplyas ``releases,'' or alternatively, as ``facilities'' or ``sites.''Information Available to the PublicThe Headquarters and Regional public dockets for the NPL (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> portion of this notice) contain documents relating tothe scoring and evaluation of sites in this final rule. The dockets areavailable for viewing ``by appointment only'' after the appearance of thisnotice. The hours of operation for the Headquarters docket are from 9:00a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday excluding Federal holidays. Pleasecontact individual Regional dockets for hours.The Headquarters docket contains a memorandum-to-the-record describingthe RCRA status of the sites, HRS score sheets for each final site, a DocumentationRecord for each Final site describing the information used to compute thescores, a list of documents referenced in the Documentation Record, commentsreceived, and the Agency's response to those comments (the ``Support Document'').Each Regional docket includes all information available in the Headquartersdocket for sites in that Region, as well as the actual reference documents,which contain the data upon which EPA principally relied upon in calculatingor evaluating the HRS scores for sites in the Region. These reference documentsare available only in the Regional dockets. They may be viewed ``by appointmentonly'' in the appropriate Regional docket or Superfund Branch office. Requestsfor copies may be directed to the appropriate Regional docket or SuperfundBranch.An informal written request, rather than a formal request, should be theordinary procedure for obtaining copies of any of these documents.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose and Implementation of the NPL</ITAG>PurposeThe primary purpose of the NPL is stated in the legislative history ofCERCLA (Report of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, SenateReport No. 96-848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The priority lists serve primarily informational purposes, identifyingfor the States and the public those facilities and sites or other releaseswhich appear to warrant remedial actions. Inclusion of a facility or siteon the list does not in itself reflect a judgment of the activities ofits owner or operator, it does not require those persons to undertake anyaction, nor does it assign liability to any person. Subsequent governmentaction in the form of remedial actions or enforcement actions will be necessaryin order to do so, and these actions will be attended by all appropriateprocedural safeguards.</ITAG>The purpose of the NPL, therefore, is primarily to serve as an informationaland management tool. The initial identification of a site for the NPL isintended primarily to guide EPA in determining which sites warrant furtherinvestigation to assess the nature and extent of the public health andenvironmental risks associated with the site, and to determine what CERCLA-financedremedial action(s), if any, may be appropriate. The NPL also serves tonotify the public of sites EPA believes warrant further investigation.Federal facility sites are eligible for the NPL pursuant to the NCP at40 CFR 300.66(c)(2), and are included on the NPL even if there are RCRAhazardous waste management units within the facility boundaries, consistentwith the Federal facilities listing policy (54 FR 10520, March 13, 1989).However, section 111(e)(3) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, limits the expenditureof CERCLA monies at Federally-owned facilities. Federal facility sitesare also subject to the requirements of CERCLA section 120, added by SARA.ImplementationA site can undergo remedial action financed by the Trust Fund establishedunder CERCLA only after it is placed on the final NPL as outlined in theNCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2) and 300.68(a). However, EPA may take enforcementactions under CERCLA against responsible parties regardless of whetherthe site is on the NPL. The fact that the Agency may defer the listingof a site subject to RCRA Subtitle C does not preclude the use of CERCLAsection 104 to respond to a release or CERCLA section 106 to compel actionby multiple parties at such a site. EPA also has the authority to takeremoval actions at any site, whether listed or not, that meets the criteriaof the NCP at 40 CFR 300.65-67.EPA's policy is to pursue cleanup of NPL sites using the appropriate responseand/or enforcement actions available to the Agency, including authoritiesother than CERCLA (e.g., RCRA). Listing a site will serve as notice toany potentially responsible party that the Agency may initiate CERCLA-financedremedial action. The Agency will decide on a site-by-site basis whetherto take enforcement or other action under CERCLA or other statutory authorities,to proceed directly with CERCLA-financed response actions and seek to recoverresponse costs after cleanup, or to do both. To the extent feasible, oncesites are on the NPL, EPA will determine high-priority candidates for Superfund-financedresponse action and/or enforcement action through both State and Federalinitiatives. These determinations will take into account which approachis more likely to most expeditiously accomplish cleanup of the site whileusing CERCLA's limited resources as efficiently as possible.Remedial response actions will not necessarily be funded in the same orderas a site's ranking on the NPL_that is, its HRS score. The informationcollected to develop HRS scores is not sufficient in itself to determineeither the extent of contamination or the appropriate response for a particularsite. EPA relies on further, more detailed investigations undertaken duringthe remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to address these concerns.The RI/FS determines the type and extent of contamination. It also takesinto account the amount of contaminants in the environment, the risk toaffected populations and the environment, the cost to correct problemsat the site, and the response actions that have been taken by potentiallyresponsible parties or others. Decisions on the type and extent of actionto be taken at these sites are made in accordance with the criteria containedin Subpart F of the NCP. After conducting these additional studies, EPAmay conclude that it is not desirable to initiate a CERCLA remedial actionat some sites on the NPL because of more pressing needs at other sites,or because a private party cleanup is already underway pursuant to an enforcementaction. Given the limited resources available in Superfund, the Agencymust carefully balance the relative needs for response at the numeroussites it has studied. It is also possible that EPA will conclude afterfurther analysis that the site does not warrant remedial action.Revisions to the NPL such as today's rulemaking may move some previouslylisted sites to a lower position on the NPL. However, if EPA has initiatedaction such as an RI/FS at a site, it does not intend to cease such actionsto determine if a subsequently listed site should have a higher priorityfor funding. Rather, the Agency will continue funding site studies andremedial actions once they have been initiated, even if higher scoringsites are later added to the NPL.<T3>RI/FS at Proposed Sites. </T3>An RI/FS can be performed at proposedsites (or even non-NPL sites) pursuant to the Agency's removal authorityunder CERCLA, as outlined in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.68(a)(1). Section 101(23)of CERCLA defines ``remove'' or ``removal'' to include ``such actions asmay be necessary to monitor, assess and evaluate the release or threatof release * * *'' The definition of ``removal'' also includes ``actiontaken under Section 104(b) of this Act * * *,'' which authorizes the Agencyto perform studies, investigations, and other information-gathering activities.Although an RI/FS is generally conducted at a site after the site has beenplaced on the NPL, in a number of circumstances the Agency elects to conductan RI/FS at a proposed NPL site in preparation for a possible CERCLA-financedremedial action, such as when the Agency believes that a delay may createunnecessary risks to human health or the environment. In addition, theAgency may conduct an RI/FS to assist in determining whether to conducta removal or enforcement action at a site.<T3>Facility (Site) Boundaries. </T3>The Agency has received a number ofinquiries concerning whether EPA could (or would) revise NPL site boundaries.The issue frequently arises where a landowner seeks to sell an allegedlyuncontaminated portion of an NPL site. The Agency's position is that itis neither feasible nor consistent with the limited purpose of the NPL(as the mere identification of releases), for the Agency to describe preciseboundaries of releases.CERCLA section (a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list national priorities amongthe known ``releases or threatened releases'' of hazardous substances.Thus, the purpose of the NPL is merely to identify releases of hazardoussubstances that are priorities for further evaluation. Although a CERCLA``facility'' is broadly defined to include any area where a hazardous substancerelease ``come to be located'' (CERCLA Section 101(9)), the listing processitself is not intended to define or reflect the boundaries of such facilitiesor releases.\2\<NOTE/> Of course, HRS data upon which the NPL placement was basedwill, to some extent, describe which release is at issue; that is, theNPL release would include all releases evaluated as part of that HRS analysis(including noncontiguous releases evaluated under the NPL aggregation policy,<T3>see </T3>48 FR 40663 (September 8, 1983)).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Although CERCLA section 101(9) sets out the definitionof ``facility'' and not ``release,'' those terms are often used interchangeability.(See CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B), which defines the NPL as a list of ``releases''as well as the highest priority ``facilities.'') (For ease of reference,EPA also uses the term ``release'' and ``facility.'')Because the Agency does not formally define the geographic extent of releases(or sites) at the time of listing, there is no administrative process to``delist'' allegedly uncontaminated areas of an NPL site (or to expandsites to follow the contamination where it has come to be located).\3\<NOTE/> Such a process would be time-consuming, subject to constantre-verification, and wasteful of resources. Further, the NPL is only oflimited significance, as it does not assign liability to any party. <T3>See </T3>Report of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works,Senate Rep. No. 96-848, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 60 (1980), quoted at 48 FR40659 (September 8, 1983). If a party contests liability for releases ondiscrete parcels of property, it may do so if and when the Agency bringsan action against that party to recover costs or to compel a response actionat that property.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Agency has already discussed its authority to followcontamination as far as it goes, and then to consider the release or facilityfor response purposes to be the entire area where the hazardous substanceshave come to be located. 54 FR 13298 (March 31, 1989).EPA regulations do provide that the ``nature and extent of the threat presentedby a release'' will be determined by an RI/FS as more information is developedon site contamination (40 CFR 300.68(d)). However, this inquiry focuseson an evaluation of the <T3>threat</T3> posed; it is not a requirement to define the boundariesof the release, and in any event is independent of the NPL listing. Moreover,it is generally impossible to discover the full extent of where the contamination``has come to be located'' prior to completion of all necessay studies<T3>and</T3> remedial work at a site; indeed, the boundaries of the contaminationcan be expected to change over time. Thus, in most cases, it will be impossibleto describe the boundaries of a release with certainty.At the same time, however, the Agency notes that the RI/FS or Record orDecision (ROD) may offer a useful indication to the public of the areasof contamination at which the Agency is considering taking a response action,<T3>based on information known at that time</T3>. For example, EPA mayevaluate (and list) a release over a 400-acre area, but the ROD may selecta remedy over 100 acres only. This information may be useful to a landownerseeking to sell the other 300 acres, but it would result in no formal changein the fact that a release is included on the NPL. The landowner (and thepublic) should also note in such a case that if further study (or the remedialconstruction itself) reveals that the contamination is located on or hasspread to other areas, the Agency may address those areas as well.This view of the NPL as an initial identification of a release that isnot subject to constant re-evaluation is consistent with the Agency's policyof not rescoring NPL sites:<ITAG tagnum="21">EPA recognizes that the NPL process cannot be perfect, and it is possiblethat errors exist or that new data will alter previous assumptions. Oncethe initial scoring effort is complete, however, the focus of EPA activitymust be on investigating sites in detail and determining the appropriateresponse. New data or errors can be considered in that process . . . [T]heNPL serves as a guide to EPA and does not determine liability or the needfor response.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">49 FR 37081 (September 21, 1984).\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See also <T3>City of Stoughton, Wisc.</T3> v. <T3>U.S. EPA</T3>, 858 F. 2d 747, 751 (D.C.Cir. 1988):<ITAG tagnum="28">Certainly EPA could have permitted further comment or conducted furthertesting [on proposed NPL sites].

NPL Update Process</ITAG>There are three mechanisms for placing sites on the NPL. The principalmechanism is the application of the HRS. The HRS serves as a screeningdevice to evaluate the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substancesto cause human health or safety problems, or ecological or environmentaldamage. The HRS score is calculated by estimating risks presented in threepotential ``pathways'' of human or environmental exposure: ground water,surface water, and air. Within each pathway of exposure, the HRS considersthree categories of factors ``that are designed to encompass most aspectsof the likelihood of exposure to a hazardous substance through a releaseand the magnitude or degree of harm from such exposure'': (1) factors thatindicate the presence or likelihood of a release to the environment; (2)factors that indicate the nature and quantity of the substances presentingthe potential threat; and (3) factors that indicate the human or environmental``targets'' potentially at risk from the site. Factors within each of thesethree categories are assigned a numerical value according to a set scale.Once numerical values are computed for each factor, the HRS uses mathematicalformulas that reflect the relative importance and interrelationships ofthe various factors to arrive at a final site score on a scale of 0 to100. The resultant HRS score represents an estimate of the relative ``probabilityand magnitude of harm to the human population or sensitive environmentfrom exposure to hazardous substances as a result of the contaminationof ground water, surface water, or air'' (47 FR 31180, July 16, 1982).Those sites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for theNPL.Under the second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State maydesignate a single site as its top priority, regardless of the HRS score.This mechanism is provided by section 105(a)(98(B) of CERCLA, as amendedby SARA, which requires that, to the extent practicable, the NPL includewithin the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each Staterepresenting the greatest danger to public health, welfare, or the environmentamong known facilities in the State.The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(b)(4)(50 FR 37624, September 16, 1985), has been used only in rare instances.It allows certain sites with HRS scores below 28.50 to be eligible forthe NPL if all of the following occur:andbullet; The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry of the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services has issued a health advisory whichrecommends dissociation of individuals from the release.andbullet; EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat topublic health.andbullet; EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use itsremedial authority than to use its removal authority to respond to therelease.All of the sites in today's final rule have been placed on the NPL basedon HRS scores.States have the primary responsibility for identifying non-Federal sites,computing HRS scores, and submitting candidate sites to the EPA Regionaloffices. EPA Regional offices conduct a quality control review of the States'candidate sites, and may assist in investigating, sampling, monitoring,and scoring sites. Regional offices may also consider candidate sites inaddition to those submitted by States. EPA Headquarters conducts furtherquality assurance audits to ensure accuracy and consistency among the variousEPA and State offices participating in the scoring. The Agency then proposesthe sites that meet one of the three criteria for listing (and EPA's listingpolicies) and solicits public comments on the proposal. Based on thesecomments and further review by EPA, the Agency determines final HRS scoresand places those sites that still qualify on the final NPL.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Statutory Requirements and Listing Policies</ITAG>CERCLA restricts EPA's authority to respond to certain categories of releasesof hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants by expressly excludingsome substances, such as petroleum, from the response program. In addition,CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites ``among''the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,or contaminants, and section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certainenumerated and ``other appropriate'' factors in doing so. Thus, as a matterof policy, EPA has the discretion not to use CERCLA to respond to certaintypes of releases. For example, EPA has chosen not to list sites that resultfrom contamination associated with facilities licensed by the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission (NRC), on the grounds that the NRC has the authority and expertiseto clean up releases from those facilities (48 FR 40661, September 8, 1983).Where other authorities exist, placing the site on the NPL for possibleremedial action under CERCLA may not be appropriate. Therefore, EPA haschosen not to consider certain types of sites for the NPL even though CERCLAmay provide authority to respond. If, however, the Agency later determinesthat sites not listed as a matter of policy are not being properly respondedto, the Agency may place them on the NPL. The listing policy of relevance to this final rule applies to sites subjectto the corrective action authorities of RCRA Subtitle C. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Development of the NPL/RCRA Policy</ITAG>Since the first NPL final rule (48 FR 40658, September 8, 1983) the Agency'spolicy has been to defer listing sites that could be addressed by the RCRASubtitle C corrective action authorities, even though EPA has the statutoryauthority to list all RCRA sites that meet the NPL eligibility criterion(i.e., a score of 28.50 or greater under the HRS). Until 1984, RCRA correctiveaction authorities were limited to facilities with releases to ground waterfrom surface impoundments, waste piles, land treatment areas, and landfillsthat received RCRA hazardous waste after July 26, 1982. Sites which metthese criteria were listed only if they were abandoned or lacked sufficientresources, Subtitle C corrective action authorities could not be enforced,or a significant portion of the release came from nonregulated units. On November 8, 1984, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) wereenacted. HWSA greatly expanded RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authoritiesas follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Section 3004(u) requires permits issued after the enactmentof HSWA to include corrective action for all releases of hazardous wasteor constituents from solid waste management units at a treatment, storage,or disposal facility seeking a permit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Section 3004(v) requires corrective action to be taken beyondthe facility boundary where necessary to protect human health and the environmentunless the owner/operator of the facility demonstrates that despite theowner or operator's best efforts, the owner or operator was unable to obtainthe necessary permission to undertake such action. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Section 3008(h) authorizes the Administrator of EPA to issuean order requiring corrective action or such other response measures asdeemed necessary to protect human health or the environment whenever itis determined that there is or has been a release of hazardous waste intothe environment from a facility with interim status. </ITAG>As a result of the broadened Subtitle C corrective action authorities ofHSWA, the Agency sought comment on a policy for deferring the listing ofnon-Federal sites subject to the Subtitle C corrective action authorities(50 FR 14117, April 10, 1985). Under the draft policy, the listing of suchsites would be deferred unless and until the Agency determined that RCRAcorrective action was not likely to succeed or occur promptly due to factorssuch as: andbullet; The inability or unwillingness of the owner/operator to pay foraddressing the contamination at the site. andbullet; Inadequate financial responsibility guarantees to pay for suchcosts. andbullet; EPA or State priorities for addressing RCRA sites. The intent of the policy was to maximize the number of site responses achievedthrough the RCRA corrective action authorities, thus preserving the CERCLAFund for sites for which no other authority is available. Federal facilitysites were not considered in the development of the policy at that timebecause the NCP prohibited placing Federal facility sites on the NPL. On June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21057), EPA announced components of a policy forthe listing, or the deferral from listing, of several categories of non-Federalsites subject to the RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities. Underthe policy, RCRA sites not subject to Subtitle C corrective action authoritieswould continue to be placed on the NPL. Examples of such sites include:andbullet; Facilities that ceased treating, storing, or disposing of hazardouswaste prior to November 19, 1980 (the effective date of Phase I of theRCRA regulations), and to which the RCRA corrective action or other authoritiesof Subtitle C cannot be applied. andbullet; Sites at which only materials exempted from the statutory or regulatorydefinition of solid waste or hazardous waste were managed. andbullet; RCRA hazardous waste handlers to which RCRA Subtitle C correctiveaction authorities do not apply, such as hazardous waste generators ortransporters not required to have interim status or a final RCRA permit.Further, the policy stated that certain RCRA sites at which Subtitle Ccorrective action authorities are available may also be listed if theymeet the criterion for listing (i.e., an HRS score of 28.50 or greater)and they fall within one of the following categories: andbullet; Facilities owned by persons who have demonstrated an inabilityto finance a cleanup as evidenced by their invocation of the bankruptcylaws. andbullet; Facilities that have lost authorization to operate and for whichthere are additional indications that the owner or operator will be unwillingto undertake corrective action. Authorization to operate may be lost whenissuance of a corrective action order under RCRA section 3008(h) terminatesthe interim status of a facility or when the interim status of the facilityis terminated as a result of a permit denial under RCRA section 3005(c).Also, authorization to operate is lost through operation of RCRA section3005(e)(2) when an owner or operator of a land disposal facility did notcertify compliance with applicable ground water monitoring and financialresponsibility requirements and submit a Part B permit application by November8, 1985_also known in HSWA as the Loss of Interim Status Provision (LOIS)).andbullet; Facilities that have not lost authorization to operate, but whichhave a clear history of unwillingness. These situations are determinedon a case-by-case basis.andbullet; On June 24, 1988 (53 FR 23978) EPA amended the June 10, 1986 policy(51 FR 21057) to include four additional categories of RCRA sites as appropriatefor the NPL. These categories are: andbullet; Non- or late filers. andbullet; Converters. andbullet; Protective filers. andbullet; Sites holding permits issued before the enactment of HSWA. In that same June 24, 1988 notice, the Agency proposed to add 13 sitesto the NPL on the basis of the amended NPL/RCRA policy, and to drop 30sites from the proposed NPL because they were subject to the Subtitle Ccorrective action authorities of RCRA and did not, at the time, appearto fall into one of the categories of RCRA facilities that EPA considersappropriate for listing under the current policy. In addition, in a separate<T4>Federal Register</T4> notice on the same date (53 FR 23988), the Agencyproposed Update andplusmin;7, which included a number of RCRA sites for listingunder the NPL/RCRA policy. Nine of these sites are being added to the NPLin today's final rule. Also, on May 5, 1989 (54 FR 19526), the Agency proposedUpdate andplusmin;8, which included 10 sites. One of these sites, a RCRAsite, received no comment and is being added to the NPL in today's finalrule. Unwillingness CriteriaAs part of the NPL/RCRA policy announced on June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21059),EPA explained its policy of listing RCRA sites where the owner/operatorhas demonstrated an unwillingness to take corrective action. The policystated that, as a general matter, EPA prefers using available RCRA enforcementor permitting authorities to require corrective action by the owner/operatorat RCRA sites because this helps to conserve CERCLA resources for siteswith no financially viable owner/operator. However, when the Agency determinesthat a RCRA facility owner/operator is unwilling to carry out correctiveaction directed by EPA or a State pursuant to a RCRA order or permit, thereis little assurance that releases will be addressed in a timely mannerunder a RCRA order or permit. Therefore, such facilities should be listedin order to make CERCLA resources available expeditiously. Under the policy,RCRA facilities will be placed on the NPL when owners/operators are foundto be unwilling based on a case-by-case determination.Several RCRA facilities being finalized in this rule were proposed forthe NPL based upon their HRS scores and EPA's case-by-case determinationthat the owner/operators were unwilling to take corrective action. Foreach such site, the Agency has prepared a lengthy memorandum to the record,documenting the actions (or failures to act) upon which the unwillingnessfinding was based. EPA solicited comment on the listing of these sites(and on the findings of unwillingness), and is responding to comment hereand in the accompanying support document. EPA believes that the sites areappropriate for the NPL. On August 9, 1988 (53 FR 30005), EPA added objectivecriteria to its policy for determining unwillingness. Specifically, a RCRAfacility would be placed on the NPL based on unwillingness when the owner/operatorsare not in compliance with one or more of the following:andbullet; Federal or substantially equivalent State unilateral administrativeorder requiring corrective action, after the facility owner/operator hasexhausted administrative due process rightsandbullet; Federal or substantially equivalent State unilateral administrativeorder requiring corrective action, if the facility owner/operator did notpursue administrative due process rights within the specified time periodandbullet; Initial Federal or State preliminary injunction or other judicialorder requiring corrective actionandbullet; Federal or State RCRA permit condition requiring corrective actionafter the facility owner/operator has exhausted administrative due processrightsandbullet; Final Federal or State consent decree or administrative orderon consent requiring corrective action, after the exhaustion of any disputeresolution proceduresHowever, the Agency explained it would be both unnecessary and inappropriateto go back and reexamine already proposed sites based on the revised criteria.First, the revised criteria had not been announced when the sites in thisrule were evaluated for unwillingness and proposed for the NPL. Second,the new criteria do not represent a substantive change, but rather, anattempt at developing more easily applied and understood objective crtieria.EPA believes that the determinations of unwillingness made for the sitesin this rule fully satisfy the Agency's policy and goals. Third, the Agencyrecognized that some lead time would be necessary for the Regions and Statesto apply the new criteria to sites before submitting them for proposalto the NPL; specifically, the Regions and States would be required to issuecorrective action orders at RCRA sites before determining unwillingness,rather than evaluating all evidence on a case-by-case basis. Thus, theAgency decided to apply the new criteria only to sites proposed after August9, 1988, so as not to significantly and unneccessarily delay promulgationand response action at already proposed sites.Amended NPL/RCRA PolicyOn June 24, 1988 (53 FR 23978), the Agency amended its NPL/RCRA policyby adding four categories of RCRA sites appropriate for listing.<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Non- or late Filers:</T3> Facilities that were treating storing ordisposing of Subtitle C hazardous waste after November 19, 1980, and didnot file a Part A RCRA permit application by that date and have littleor no history of compliance with RCRA.</ITAG>The Agency decided to place on the NPL ``non- or late filers'' based onthe finding that RCRA treatment, storage or disposal facilities (``TSDFs'')that fail to file Part A of the RCRA permit application generally remainoutside the range of cognizance of authorities responsible for compliancewith RCRA, and generally are without the institutional mechanisms, suchas ground water monitoring programs, necessary to assure prompt compliancewith the standards and goals of the RCRA program. Therefore, EPA believesthat it is not appropriate to defer to RCRA for action at these sites,even though RCRA technically may apply. However, in cases where non- orlate filer facilities have in fact come within the RCRA system and demonstrateda history of compliance with RCRA regulations (as may be the case withlate filers), the Agency may decide to defer listing and allow RCRA tocontinue to address problems at the site.<ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Converters:</T3> Facilities that at one time were treating or storingRCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste but have since converted to an activityfor which interim status is not required (e.g., generators who store hazardouswaste for 90 days or less). These facilities, the withdrawal of whose PartA application has been acknowledged by EPA or the State, are referred toas converters.</ITAG>Converters at one time treated or stored Subtitle C hazardous waste andwere required to obtain interim status. EPA believes that under RCRA section3008(h) it can compel corrective action at such sites. However, RCRA'scorrective action program currently focuses on TSDFs subject to permittingrequirements, and thus EPA has not routinely reviewed converters underRCRA Subtitle C. EPA has decided that the deferral of this category ofsites is not appropriate, as these sites are not currently engaged in treatment,storage, or disposal activities subject to RCRA permitting and they arenot a priority for prompt corrective action under RCRA. Instead, the Agencyhas decided to list such sites to make full CERCLA resources and authoritiesavailable, if necessary. In cases where a converter has agreed to correctiveaction under a RCRA unilateral or consent corrective action order, theAgency will generally defer listing and allow RCRA to continue to addressproblems at the site.EPA is currently prioritizing RCRA facilities for corrective action. Ifthe Agency determines that converter sites will in the future be addressedin an expeditious manner by RCRA authorities, then it will reconsider thelisting policy for RCRA converter sites and may defer converters to RCRAfor corrective action.<ITAG tagnum="21">(3) <T3>Protective Filers:</T3> Facilities that have filed RCRA Part A permitapplications for treatment, storage, or disposal of Subtitle C hazardouswaste as a precautionary measure only. These facilities may be generators,transporters, or recyclers of hazardous wastes, and are not subject toSubtitle C corrective action authorities.</ITAG>These facilities filed RCRA Part A permit applications as TSDFs as a precautionarymeasure only, and are generators, transporters, or recyclers of hazardouswastes. Protective filers are not subject to Subtitle C corrective actionauthorities, and thus, EPA has decided to place them on the NPL in orderto make full CERCLA resources and authorities available.<ITAG tagnum="21">(4) <T3>Pre-HSWA Permittees:</T3> Facilities with RCRA permits for the treatment,storage, or disposal of Subtitle C hazardous waste that were issued priorto the enactment of HSWA, and whose owner/operator will not voluntarilyconsent to the reissuance of their permit to include corrective actionrequirements.</ITAG>For facilities with permits that pre-date HSWA, the owner/operators arenot required through the permit to perform corrective action for releasesfrom solid waste management units, and the Agency does not have the authorityto modify such pre-HSWA permits to include facility-wide RCRA correctiveaction under RCRA section 3004(u) until the permit is reissued. Becausemany pre-HSWA permits are for 10 years, with the last pre-HSWA permit havingbeen issued prior to November 8, 1984, it could be 1994 before the Agencycould reissue some permits to include corrective action requirements. Therefore,the Agency has decided to list RCRA facilities with pre-HSWA permits (thathave HRS scores of at least 28.50, or are otherwise eligible for listing),so that CERCLA authorities will be available to more expenditiously addressany releases at such sites. However, if the permitted facility consentsto the reissuance of its pre-HSWA permit to include corrective action requirements,the Agency will consider not adding the facility to the NPL.Financial Inability to PayOn August 9, 1988 (53 FR 30002), EPA solicited comment on amendments tothe NPL/RCRA policy concerning the inability of an owner/operator to payfor cleanup at a RCRA-regulated site. The Agency received a number of commentson the amendments under consideration, but has made no final decision concerningthese issues. The Agency will respond to comments and announce its decisionon this policy in the future.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Response to Public Comments</ITAG>The Agency received a number of comments on the June 24, 1988 amendmentsto the NPL/RCRA policy, and on the application of those amendments andthe June 10, 1986 NPL/RCRA policy to sites proposed for the NPL. Responsesto the significant comments concerning the general application of the amendedcriteria are summarized below. All site-specific comments are summarizedand responded to in the support document accompanying this rule, whichis available in the Superfund dockets.VI.a. Support for the PolicyA number of commenters supported the policy to drop sites from the NPLthat can be adequately addressed under the corrective action authoritiesof RCRA Subtitle C. One commenter supported EPA's ability to initiate short-termemergency actions at RCRA sites. Another commenter supported the planneduse of RCRA authority whenever possible, since the use of RCRA authorities``avoids the administrative complexity and unneeded political burden ofNPL listing.''In response, the Agency notes that its decision to defer certain sitessubject to the RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities is based onthe ability of those authorities to achieve cleanup at a site and to preserveCERCLA resources for use at other sites.VI.b. Opposition to the PolicyA number of commenters opposed dropping RCRA sites from the proposed NPL,transferring the sites from CERCLA to RCRA authorities, on the groundsthat Superfund authorities are more protective of human health and theenvironment than are RCRA authorities. One commenter stated that Superfundcleanup standards are more stringent than RCRA's. The commenter noted thatCERCLA requires permanent treatment to the maximum extent feasible, whereasRCRA does not. The commenter added that the RCRA program does not includecleanup guidelines similar to those under Superfund. Another commenterstated that CERCLA offers more remedial options than RCRA.In response, both statutes require that remedies employed protect humanhealth and the environment. The Agency intends for the two programs toprovide similar cleanup solutions for similar environmental problems, evenif procedural requirements differ. Indeed, one of the Agency's primaryobjectives in development of the RCRA corrective action regulations isto achieve substantive consistency with the CERCLA remedial program.The NPL/RCRA policy is based on efficient allocation of limited CERCLAresources. Although CERCLA provides authority to clean up all sites, includingRCRA sites, using CERCLA in all cases would be inefficient because RCRAhas authority to conduct certain cleanup actions. Corrective action provisionsare now required in RCRA permits, which direct activities at the site,often long after cleanup actions are completed. By deferring to RCRA, moresites are addressed, and the overall goals of both statutes are advanced.Two commenters opposed transferring sites from CERCLA to RCRA authorities,maintaining that enforcement oversight is greater under CERCLA than RCRA.In response, EPA believes the RCRA program assures adequate oversight.RCRA orders and permits establish oversight on a site-by-site basis. Ifa remedial action is extremely complex or the owner/operator is not fullycooperative, EPA may provide extensive oversight. In other cases, extensiveoversight is not necessary. In any event, EPA inspection requirements applyto all sites under RCRA corrective action authorities. Under RCRA, Statesmay be authorized to operate a hazardous waste program in lieu of the Federalprogram. Consequently, in many cases States provide oversight (RCRA section3006).One commenter opposed the policy to drop RCRA sites from the NPL becauseRCRA was not intended as a cleanup bill.In response, the Agency disagrees. As discussed earlier, HSWA greatly expandedSubtitle C corrective action authorities, and EPA believes a complete cleanupcan be achieved under RCRA. As the House Committee on Energy and Commercenoted in its report on HSWA:<ITAG tagnum="21">Unless all hazardous constituent releases from solid waste managmentunits at permitted facilities are addressed and cleaned up the Committeeis deeply concerned that many more sites will be added to the future burdensof the Superfund program with little prospect for control or cleanup. Theresponsibility to control such releases lies with the facility owner andoperator and should not be shifted to the Superfund program, particularlywhen a final [RCRA] permit has been requested by the facility. H.Rept.198, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 61 (1983).</ITAG>Sites are not included on the NPL if they are subject to the RCRA SubtitleC corrective action authorities and prompt cleanup appears likely. RCRAauthorities may be used by themselves or in conjunction with CERCLA removaland enforcement authorities to initiate corrective action or to continueactions already begun. For sites being dropped from the proposed NPL, ifa CERCLA Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) or enforcementactions have been initiated, these actions will continue in order to avoiddisruption of site cleanup activities. And, of course, deferred RCRA sitesmay later be added to the NPL if corrective action is not being taken.One commenter stated that the deletion of sites prior to a complete cleanupsets a bad precedent. The commenter believes that the removal of a sitefrom the NPL because it is being managed under RCRA could give the falseimpression that the site is no longer a significant threat to public healthand the environment.In response, the deferral of a site to RCRA authorities does not mean thatthe Agency has determined that cleanup is complete or that a site no longerposes a threat to human health and the environment. Rather, it means thatthe Agency has determined that the sites can be addressed under anotherauthority, and that, to conserve CERCLA resources and avoid duplication,listing should not proceed. Furthermore, the Agency does not believe thatthe deferral of a site to RCRA authorities jeopardizes any cleanup thatis underway or planned.The Agency has requested comment on deleting certain final RCRA sites fromthe NPL in the proposed NCP revisions (53 FR 51421, December 21, 1988);even under the proposed approach, sites would only be deferred where responseaction was ``progressing adequately'' under an enforcement order or a RCRApermit and where several other conditions were met.Several commenters stated that, because RCRA does not give EPA the powersgranted by CERCLA, and because not all CERCLA authorities are availableat sites not on the NPL, deferring a site from the NPL may deny the Agencythe full scope of authorities necessary to compel cleanup by a responsibleparty. The commenters were particularly concerned that CERCLA cost recoveryauthorities are not available at RCRA sites. One commenter added that thelack of joint and several liability authorities under RCRA may obstructRCRA cleanup at multiparty sites where one party is unwilling.In response, the only authority unavailable at a deferred RCRA facilityis use of the CERCLA Trust Fund for remedial action. The Agency retainsample authorities, under both RCRA and CERCLA, to ensure expeditious cleanupat RCRA facilities. CERCLA section 104 removal actions, including Fund-financedRI/FS's, can be taken at RCRA sites to respond promptly to a release, andcost recovery for such actions would be available. In addition, where an``imminent and substantial endangerment'' is posed by a release at a RCRAfacility, the Agency may take enforcement action under CERCLA section 106and thereby compel action by multiple parties.Although cost recovery and joint and several liability provisions are notavailable for all RCRA actions, significant authorities are available underRCRA. First, enforcement actions against multiple parties can be broughtunder RCRA section 7003 if an imminent hazard exists. Second, EPA has correctiveaction authorities under RCRA section 3008(h) at interim status facilitiesand under RCRA section 3004 (u) and (v) at permitted facilities. Third,RCRA section 3013 gives EPA authority to conduct investigations and studiesat RCRA facilities and require the owner/operator to reimburse EPA forthe costs. Although RCRA focuses on owner/operator liability, the Agencycan take joint RCRA/CERCLA actions where appropriate (e.g., surface cleanupsunder RCRA, ground water cleanups under CERCLA section 106), making multipleparty solutions feasible.Under RCRA Subtitle C authorities, liability focuses on the owner/operatorfor cleanup of hazardous waste releases. However, if the owner/operatoris unwilling or unable to carry out such action, EPA may decide to placethe site on the NPL to allow Fund-financed cleanup. The Agency may thenpursue cost recovery against the owner/operator and other Potentially ResponsibleParties (PRPs).Several commenters opposed transferring sites to RCRA because, they stated,CERCLA provides for more public participation. In addition, one commenternoted that Technical Assistance Grants (TAGs) and public hearing requirementsavailable under Superfund are not available at sites being dropped fromthe NPL (53 FR 9741, March 24, 1988).In response, although the process is somewhat different in the two statutes,public participation nevertheless plays an important role in reaching cleanupdecisions under both. The commenter is correct in stating that, under CERCLAsection 117(e)(1), a TAG is not available if a site is not on or proposedfor the NPL. However, the RCRA program provides for significant publicparticipation opportunities. When issuing a draft permit (or notice ofintent to deny), the Agency gives public notice and allows 45 days forwritten comment. If interest is expressed, public hearings must be held.The Agency will also issue a fact sheet or a statement of basic about thepermitting process that is taking place. Procedures for modifying permitsat the remedy selection stage, for example, provide similar opportunitiesfor public involvement.Remedy selection through the permitting process offers public notice andcomment opportunities like those in the development of a Superfund Recordof Decision. Public participation requirements are also included in a RCRAcorrective action order, the amount depending on the circumstances. Ata minimum, the public has the opportunity to comment on the correctivemeasure EPA proposes; EPA considers and responds to all comments receivedon the corrective measure, and may change the corrective measure in responseto public comment. Requirements for additional public involvement, suchas public meetings, may be included in the order based on public interest.VI.c. General Policy Comments/SuggestionsTwo commenters stated that to obtain maximum cleanup, EPA should use bothRCRA and CERCLA authorities. The commenters believe there will be someinstances when one law or the other will be more effective.The Agency agrees. In general, the NPL/RCRA policy considers which authorityis likely to most expeditiously accomplish cleanup, while using the Fund'slimited resources as efficiently as possible. If a CERCLA section 106 enforcementaction requiring cleanup has been initiated, and a RCRA permit is to beissued to the facility, the Agency may choose to continue these actionsunder CERCLA. In such cases, the CERCLA cleanup undertaken by the responsibleparties would be considered in the RCRA permit proceedings, and the Agencywould take steps to avoid inconsistent cleanup actions under RCRA sections3004(u) at the affected portion of the facility.One commenter argued that the use of RCRA or CERCLA should not depend uponthe solvency of the owners or operators of a site.The Agency disagrees. RCRA Subtitle C authorities make owner/operatorsliable for cleanup of most hazardous waste releases. The Agency has simplydecided, as a matter of policy, that where the owner/operator is unableto pay for cleanup (e.g., has invoked the protection of the bankruptcylaws), the Agency should list the RCRA-regulated facility and thereby makeSuperfund moneys available for possible remedial action.A number of commenters suggested the Agency should defer the listing ofRCRA facilities if corrective action is being implemented under other authorities,or is being pursued voluntarily by the owner/operator. Commenters statedthat EPA should defer the listing of sites being addressed under CERCLAsection 106 enforcement orders, or sites being addressed under State authorities(regardless of whether State programs are RCRA authorized). One commenterargued that listing RCRA sites already being addressed by State agenciesdiscourages owner/operators from cooperating with State authorities sinceEPA may supplant State enforcement efforts. According to the commenter,for sites with well-advanced remedial action programs under State authorities,a shift to CERCLA would result in a delay and a duplication of effort.In response, the Agency at present defers to a limited number of authorities,including RCRA Subtitle C. In the proposed revisions to the NCP, the Agencyhas solicited comment on a policy to expand deferral to include deferralto other Federal and State authorities (53 FR 51415, December 21, 1988);however, that policy is not currently in effect. The Agency has committednot to implement any part of the expanded deferral approach until the publicand Congressional concerns have been fully reviewed and analyzed and adecision reached on whether or not to implement such a policy.The Agency does not agree that its NPL/RCRA policy results in EPA supplantingState enforcement efforts. Before a CERCLA RI/FS is begun at a site (oftenafter listing), a State or voluntary action may proceed unencumbered. Evenafter an RI/FS is underway, EPA may allow a PRP to go forward with voluntaryor State-ordered remedial actions, pursuant to CERCLA section 122(e)(6)(see 54 FR 10520, March 13, 1989). Even if a PRP is not authorized to goforward with non-CERCLA remedial actions, the Agency will consider thework accomplished; thus, actions under State law will not have been wasted.However, if EPA finds that remedial action under CERCLA is still necessary,then the cleanup standards of CERCLA section 121 must be met.Several commenters argued that shifts of responsibility from one programto the other (RCRA or CERCLA) may result in counterproductive changes inoversight personnel, duplication of administrative effort, and ultimately,delays in cleanup of sites. Commenters expressed particular concern aboutprogrammatic shifts at sites in the latter stages of a remedial effort,at sites undergoing an RI/FS, and at sites with multiple PRPs.In response, the Agency generally prefers to apply RCRA authorities atRCRA sites, and has developed the NPL/RCRA policy to avoid duplicationand delays. In addition, EPA will ensure that actions undertaken by oneprogram will be adopted by the other program if programmatic responsibilityshifts. One of the Agency's primary objectives in the development of theRCRA corrective action regulations is to achieve substantive consistencywith the remedial program under CERCLA. CERCLA section 104 or section 106enforcement orders for remedial activities can be referenced in a RCRApermit. In such cases, the Agency would take steps to avoid inconsistentcleanup actions under RCRA section 3004(u) at the affected portion of thefacility.At RCRA sites with many PRPs, EPA may choose to proceed with an enforcementaction under CERCLA section 106. Even if the Agency proceeds against theowner/operator alone under RCRA, the owner/operator may seek to recovercosts from other PRPs under CERCLA section 107(a)(4)(B); of course, tomaintain such an action, the owner/operator would have to show that thecosts incurred under RCRA were consistent with the National ContingencyPlan.A number of commenters stated that placing new categories of RCRA sites_suchas converter sites_on the NPL will overburden CERCLA resources and increasethe possibility that sites on the NPL will not be addressed expeditiously.In response, after considering the potential impact the NPL/RCRA policymay have, the Agency concluded that the policy will not significantly impactthe Trust Fund or jeopardize the timely cleanup of other sites on the NPL.As noted above, the Agency will consider deferring converter sites if thenew prioritizing initiative under RCRA results in their prompt considerationfor RCRA corrective action. In addition, the Agency will consider deferringindividual converter sites that have agreed to corrective action undera RCRA permit or order. Similarly, where it appears that certain late filersor pre-HSWA permittee sites will be cleaned up under RCRA, EPA will deferthose sites. Finally, even where RCRA sites have been placed on the finalNPL, the proposed revisions to the NCP consider deleting such sites forcorrective action under RCRA in certain prescribed circumstances (see 53FR 51421, December 21, 1988).Two commenters opposed including new categories of RCRA sites in the NPL/RCRApolicy. According to one commenter, EPA has departed from its establishedpolicy to place on the NPL only those RCRA sites where the owner/operatoris unwilling or financially unable to implement the remedy. The commenterargues that EPA has improperly expanded the listing policy to include RCRAsites where RCRA will produce a cleanup. The commenter suggests makingthe categories no more than rebuttable presumptions for listing.EPA disagrees with the commenter's suggestion that the Agency acted improperly.The NPL/RCRA policy is, as its name suggests, simply a general statementof policy, issued to advise the public of how the Agency intends to exercisea discretionary power. The Agency is free to decide to change that policy,as it did here, and advise the public of that change (53 FR 23978, June24, 1988). Indeed, as with any policy, the Agency can exercise its discretionas to whether to apply the policy at all in specific cases (Davis, <T3>Administrative Law Treatise, </T3>section 7:5 (Supp. 1982)).EPA's June 1988 decision to list_that is, not defer from listing_four newcategories of RCRA sites was not inconsistent with the Agency's prior policyon the deferral and listing of RCRA sites; rather it was an expansion ofthe existing policy. Initially, the Agency decided to defer listing forsites already regulated under RCRA, in order to avoid duplicative actions,maximize the number of cleanups, and help preserve the Trust Fund. TheAgency did, however, state that it would list RCRA sites if expeditiouscleanup appeared to be unlikely under RCRA, such as when an owner/operatorproved to be unwilling or unable to take corrective action EPA deemed necessary(51 FR 21057, June 10, 1986).Over time, the Agency has developed more experience with the RCRA deferralprogram and with RCRA cleanups at sites deferred from the NPL. EPA hasdetermined that prompt corrective action under RCRA is not likely whena RCRA owner/operator is unwilling or unable to pay, a protective filer,a non- or late filer, a converter, or a pre-HSWA permittee. Just as unwillingnessis not a requirement for demonstrating inability, neither is it a requirementfor demonstrating non-filer or converter status. The rationale for listingthe new categories is to capture all potential types of sites that areunlikely to be cleaned up expeditiously under RCRA; the policy does notinfer unwillingness on the part of the owner/operator. Converters, non-or late filers, and pre-HSWA permittees, while technically within RCRAjurisdiction, are not likely to be addressed promptly by RCRA. Non-filersgenerally remain outside the legal cognizance of RCRA, and therefore lackthe institutional mechanisms necessary to assure prompt compliance withthe standards and goals of RCRA. (If a non- or late filer comes withinthe RCRA system and demonstrates a history of compliance with RCRA regulations,the Agency may decide to defer listing). Converters, while within the legalpurview of RCRA, are not routinely reviewed under Subtitle C because ofthe current priorities of the RCRA corrective action program. Finally,the Agency does not have the authority to modify pre-HSWA permits to includeRCRA corrective action under RCRA section 3004(u) until the permit is reissued;therefore, it could be 1994 before the Agency could reissue some permitsto include corrective action.The Agency agrees with the commenter that RCRA sites may be listed underthe new criteria even if there is no express finding of unwillingness.The new categories are not subsets of the unwillingness exception to theNPL/RCRA policy. Rather, these categories are situations where cleanupsare not progressing expeditiously under RCRA, making it appropriate toprovide the option of spending CERCLA funds for remedial action.The commenter's suggestion that the four categories be made no more than``rebuttable presumptions'' for listing is largely addressed by the policy.The Agency has stated that, in general, it will not defer non- or latefilers, although it will consider deferring a site with a history of RCRAcompliance such that the Agency has confidence that it will be addressedunder RCRA. Similarly, RCRA sites with pre-HSWA permits will be deferredif the permittee agrees to reissuance of the permit, with corrective actionprovisions included. As for converters, EPA will consider deferring individualconverter sites that have agreed to corrective action under a RCRA unilateralor consent corrective action order, and the Agency will reconsider itsgeneral policy for listing converters if it finds that converters are beingaddressed promptly under RCRA (53 FR 23981, June 24, 1988). The Agencydoes not have authority to compel RCRA corrective action in the case ofprotective filers.One commenter requested adding a listing criterion for sites being addressedas part of a basin-wide scheme under CERCLA.The response, EPA does not intend to add such a criterion. Under the presentpolicy, the Agency has mechanisms for accomplishing comprehensive remediesat such sites without placing them on the NPL (not listing a site limitsonly the availability of Fund financing for remedial action). Area-widecontamination involving RCRA and CERCLA units may be addressed under: (1)an area-wide CERCLA section 106 order or (2) a hybrid of RCRA and CERCLAauthorities, with RCRA addressing the surface cleanup of RCRA units, CERCLAaddressing the surface cleanup of CERCLA units, and CERCLA addressing thecleanup of overlapping ground water contamination (with the RCRA owner/operatoras a potentially responsible party). In either case, the Agency may alsochoose to do one comprehensive RI/FS study of the area under its CERCLAremoval authority (54 FR 13298, March 31, 1989).One commenter stated that the decision on which authority to use shouldbe made after the site is placed on the final NPL. According to the commenter,placement of a site on the NPL does not bind either EPA or owner/operatorsand PRPs to address the site under RCRA or CERCLA, and allows EPA to useenforcement authorities RCRA does not have, if necessary.In response, it is true that placing a site on the NPL does not force theAgency to use CERCLA authorities, or CERCLA authorities alone. The Agencyis free to use CERCLA and/or any other authorities that apply to the sitein question. The converse is also true_EPA can use CERCLA removal and enforcementauthorities at NPL and non-NPL sites. The NPL serves primarily as a managementtool for the Agency in setting priorities under CERCLA, especially foruse of the Trust Fund. The NPL/RCRA policy is one tool in this prioritizationprocess; its goal is to maximize the overall number of site cleanups byusing RCRA corrective action authorities where available and likely toresult in espeditious cleanup, thus preserving CERCLA resources for othersites. The Agency believes that RCRA owner/operators should finance cleanupsat their facilities. If, however, the owner/operator is unwilling or unableto finance cleanup, or the facility is outside the RCRA regulatory system(a non-filer), the Agency has established criteria for the listing of thesesites.The commenter stated it would be poor policy to transfer sites from CERCLAto RCRA at the end of the Reagan Administration. The commenter believesthe new Administration should reassess the policy.In response, this rule has been reviewed by and signed by the current Administration.The NPL/RCRA policy is being continued, subject to periodic review.VI.d. Non- or Late FilersThe commenter argued that the decision to list a non- or late filer shouldbe based on the facility's history of compliance with RCRA. The commenteradded that the Agency should assure that sites that filed a part A permitapplication late, or not at all, but that have subsequently made an effortto comply with RCRA regulations, will be deferred from the NPL. Accordingto the commenter, potential buyers of non- or late filer facilities willbe inhibited from buying these facilities (and cleaning them up) becauseof the possibility of listing.In response, EPA deliberately stated that it ``will consider'' deferringcertain non- or late filers, because the Agency does not wish to implythat deferral is automatic. The Agency will consider for deferral any non-or late filer facility that has come within the RCRA system and demonstrateda history of compliance with RCRA regulations. The Agency does not believethat its determination of the adequacy of a non- or late filer's effortto comply with RCRA regulations will inhibit a potential sale. A non- orlate filer that complies with the appropriate RCRA regulations and activelypursues corrective action under RCRA (through a permit or order) will generallybe seen as a good candidate for deferral.The commenter stated that non- or late filing often results from ignoranceof regulatory requirements, and that placing a site on the NPL should thereforebe based on willingness, not history of RCRA compliance.In response, non- or late filers are not subsets of the unwillingness exceptionto the RCRA deferral policy. Rather, the Agency has identified this andtwo other categories as situations where cleanups may not progress expeditiouslyunder RCRA, and thus EPA wants the option of spending CERCLA funds forremedial action. The decision to add a non- or late filer site to the NPLis generally based on the fact that no timely permit application has beenmade, and thus adequate regulatory mechanisms (e.g., ground water monitoringprograms, compliance inspections, and closure requirements) may not bein place to assure prompt compliance with the standards and goals of theRCRA program. Because of RCRA program priorities, the Agency may not alwaysbe able to immediately address a non- or late filer that is suddenly willingto be addressed under RCRA authorities. The Agency believes that in mostcases it is in the best interest of environmental protection to make CERCLAfunds available at such sites.VI.e. ConvertersOne commenter supported the proposed policy to list converters but suggestedthat the policy should include facilities that submitted part A permitapplications under RCRA and did not actively pursue part B permits and/orwhose operations no longer demand a part B permit. The commenter refersto these sites as ``de facto'' converters and believes they should be treatedthe same as generators.In response, converters are facilities that at one time treated or storedRCRA subtitle C hazardous waste but have since converted to generator-onlystatus (i.e., facilities that now store hazardous waste for 90 days orless, an activity for which interim status is not required). The sitesdescribed by the commenter will be considered converters only if thereis documentation of conversion and the Agency agrees that the sites areappropriate for the NPL.The Agency does not believe that converters should receive the same treatmentas generators with regard to the NPL. The Agency does not have correctiveaction authority under RCRA subtitle C to compel cleanup at generator-onlyfacilities, and thus deferral to RCRA for corrective action would be inappropriate.By contrast, the Agency can, under subtitle C, compel corrective actionat converter facilities; however, because of current priorities in theRCRA program, the Agency believes converter facilities should be placedon the NPL to ensure prompt corrective action.Some of the facilities described by the commenter may also be protectivefilers; that is, they filed a Part A permit application as a precautionarymeasure only and did not pursue a Part B permit. If a facility did in factfile for interim status protectively, listing may be appropriate underthis policy.Several commenters suggested that the policy for listing converters unfairlypenalizes owner/operators that take environmentally responsible actionsto close waste handling activities and convert to generators status. Thecommenter stated that the policy would inhibit owner/operators from reducingtheir hazardous waste activities, because if they converted to generatorstatus they might be placed on the NPL as a converter.In response, the Agency does not list a RCRA site solely on the basis ofa its decision to discontinue treatment or storage activities. A site mustreceive an HRS score equal to or higher than the cutoff score to be placedon the NPL. The Agency believes it unlikely that, to avoid listing, a facilityowner/operator would choose to retain treatment or storage status, whichmeans the site remains subject to all RCRA requirements, including cleanupunder RCRA corrective action authorities. In addition, it is unlikely andowner/operator will incur the cost of RCRA permitting and/or oversightmerely to avoid listing. Finally, if a converter agrees to corrective actionunder RCRA, the Agency will generally defer the listing of such a site.One commenter opposed the listing of converters, arguing that the Agencyshould use RCRA section 3008(h) corrective action authorities at such facilities.According to the commenter, the RCRA program should prioritize and allocateits resources to address any sites, including converters, that may needcorrective action.The Agency believes that under RCRA section 3008(h) it can compel correctiveaction at converter facilities. Nonetheless, the Agency has decided, asa matter of policy, to list converters since EPA has not routinely reviewedconverters under RCRA subtitle C, and the Agency believes it can ensureexpeditious remedial action at these sites if they are placed on the NPL.The EPA is currently prioritizing RCRA facilities for corrective action.If the Agency determines that converter sites will be addressed in an expeditiousmanner by RCRA authorities, then it will reconsider the policty to listconverters. Moreover, where a converter has agreed to corrective action such as undera RCRA section 3008(h) order, the Agency will generally defer listing suchsites and allow RCRA to continue to address the contamination problemsat the site.VI.f. Protective FilersTwo commenters agreed with EPA's conclusion that the Agency does not havethe authority to compel cleanup of protective filers under RCRA subtitleC corrective action authorities. One commenter suggested RCRA section 7003authorities as an alternative to CERCLA authorities when an ``imminentand substantial endangerment'' exists.In response, since the beginning of the NPL, EPA's clear policy has beento defer the listing of RCRA sites where the regulatory authorities ofRCRA subtitle C apply. For example, on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40662),the Agency stated: ``where a site consists of regulated units of a RCRAfacility operating pursuant to a permit or interim status, it will notbe included on the NPL'' (48 FR 40662). The Agency explained that the HazardousWaste Management Regulations (40 CFR 260-265) give EPA and the states authorityto control sites through a broad program which includes monitoring, complianceinspections, penalties for violations, and requirements for post-closureplans and financial responsibility.The passage of HSWA, in 1984, expanded RCRA's corrective action authoritiesunder subtitle C even further, and the scope of the RCRA deferral policywas corespondingly expanded. The deferral policy was thus based on a determinationthat in most cases, hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilitieswould be managed and permitted (or closed) under an on-going RCRA regulatorysystem, and that in most appropriate cases, contamination would be cleanedup.EPA did not, in its NPL/RCRA policy, propose to defer sites if a RCRA section70003 enforcement action could potentially be taken. Unlike the provisionsof RCRA subtitle C, which set up an on-going program for the managementof hazarous wastes, section 7003 provides authority for the Agency to takeenforcement actions in extraordinary cases where ``the past or presenthandling, storage, treatment, transportation or disposal of any solid wasteor hazardous waste may present an imminent or substantial endangermentto health or the environment.'' Although limited to cases involving imminentand substantial endangerment, section 7003 is sweeping at the same time.It applies to past RCRA owners as well as present owner/operators, andit applies to all facilities that handle ``solid'' (nonhazardous) wastes;solid waste facilities are not required to have RCRA subtitle C permitsor interim status. EPA has determined that it would not be appropriateto defer listing RCRA sites (and solid waste sites) to section 7003 simplybecause that section might provide a means of addressing contaminationproblems. Rather, EPA has limited deferral to cases where the subtitleC regulatory program is in place, and prompt corrective action appearslikely.VI.g. Pre-HSWA PermitteesSeveral commenters opposed listing pre-HSWA permittees because they believeCongress intended that pre-HSWA permitted facilities be addressed underRCRA. The commenters stated that EPA has authority under RCRA section 3005(c)(3)to modify a permit at any time to comply with currently applicable RCRAregulations, including corrective action, and under RCRA section 7003 torequire cleanup if an ``imminent and substantial endangerment'' exists.The commenters believe that listing pre-HSWA permittees would circumventCongressional intent and burden Superfund. One commenter added that theAgency's requirement that a facility with a final RCRA permit ``consent''to a modification of its pre-HSWA permit, including corrective action requirementsto avoid listing, consitutes an abuse of Agency authority.In response, RCRA section 3005(c)(3), which states ``Nothing in this subsectionshall preclude the Administrator from reviewing and modifying a permitat any time during its term,'' merely preserved preexisting authority tomodify permits. However, facility-wide corrective action at RCRA facilitiesapplies only when the permit is issued or reissued. Section 3004(u), thefacility-wide corrective action authority, requires such corrective actiononly for permits ``issued'' after 1984. Under EPA regulations, a ``modification''is significantly different from a permit issuance. Modification of a pre-HSWApermit does not trigger 3004(u) corrective action; the permit must be reissuedto include facility-wide corrective action.Because the Agency lacks authority to address pre-HSWA permittees throughRCRA section 3004(u) until permit reissuance, there is no immediate mechanismto require corrective action at pre-HSWA permitted facilities. As EPA explainedon June 24, 1988 (53 FR 23978), many pre-HSWA permits were issued for 10years, and the last pre-HSWA permit was issued in 1984. Thus, it couldbe 1994 before the Agency can reissue all pre-HSWA permits to include facility-widecorrective action. The Agency is proposing that facilities with pre-HSWApermits be considered for the NPL in order to assure expeditious correctiveaction at the site.The Agency disagrees that allowing a pre-HSWA permittee to consent to modificationof its permit rather than to be placed on the NPL is an ``abuse of authority.''Allowing a pre-HSWA permittee to consent to reissuance of its pre-HSWApermit to include 3004(u) corrective action rather than be placed on theNPL gives the opportunity to clean up under RCRA if the permittee choosesto do so.VI.h. Application Of Unwillingness PolicySeveral commenters asserted that sites proposed for the NPL based on thecase-by-case unwillingness criteria of June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21057) shouldbe re-examined under the revised criteria of August 9, 1988 (53 FR 30005).In response, the Agency specifically stated that the new criteria shouldbe applied prospectively only, and that it would be unnecessary and inappropriateto devote CERCLA resources to an additional review of unwillingness determinationsthat were properly made under a case-by-case determination (53 FR 30007).Prior to the August 1988 policy, EPA listed RCRA sites as ``unwilling''after a detailed case-by-case review that required considerable time andresources, and generated long support documents. To simplify the processand make it easier to understand, the Agency laid out objective criteriathat would be simple to apply (53 FR 30005, August 9, 1988). In doing so,the Agency was not suggesting that prior determinations were somehow insufficientor incorrect; indeed, EPA believes that its case-by-case determinationswere appropriate, and fully in line with the goals of the NPL/RCRA policy.Rather, the new criteria reflect an effort to replace the flexible andcase-specific requirements of the past with more standardized documentationrequirements in the future; the substantive goals of the policy are notchanged. Thus, the issuance of the new standardized criteria for the futuredid not warrant a reassessment of sites already proposed for the NPL basedon thorough, past unwillingness determinations.The Agency chose to apply the new criteria prospectively to give EPA Regionsand States enough lead time to understand the new requirements and prepareappropriate listing packages. For instance, the Regions or States may issuea specific RCRA corrective action order to demonstrate unwillingness evenif other indicators of unwillingness are available. Applying the new criteriato already-proposed sites might require issuing additional orders fruitlesslyif the owner/operator has already shown unwillingness, and listing wouldbe significantly delayed, contrary to Congressional intent that EPA expeditiouslylist sites.In any event, listing does not mean that remedial action will be taken;it only makes the site eligible for Fund-financed remedial action, shouldthat prove necessary. Thus, the significance of the listing decision islimited. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit noted in <T3>City of Stoughton, Wisconsin </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>``the NPL is simply a rough list of priorities, assembledquickly and inexpensively to comply with Congress' mandate for the Agencyto take action straightaway.'' (858 F.2d 747, 751 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). Itis both reasonable and appropriate for EPA to limit the resources it expendson the determination of which of its statutues_RCRA or CERCLA_should haveprimary responsibility for securing needed corrective action.One commenter suggested that the unwillingness policy rewards recalcitranceunder RCRA, since if the owner/operator ignores RCRA obligations, and thesite is placed on the NPL, EPA will find PRPs and engage in cost recoveryefforts. The unwilling owner/operator has fewer transactional and administrativecosts and a smaller share of cleanup costs.In response, the Agency believes it is not advantageous for owner/operatorsto ignore their RCRA obligations. If an owner/operator does not complywith RCRA regulations, the Agency can pursue both RCRA and CERCLA enforcementauthorities. RCRA corrective action orders can contain penalties of upto $25,000 per day of noncompliance and can result in a suspension or revocationof the facility's permit or interim status. EPA can also use CERCLA section106 authorities and subsequently recover any cost incurred. EPA does notbelieve the policy rewards recalcitrance; the policy is designed to providea framework for most effectively addressing releases that may affect publichealth and the environment.One commenter believes that sites where owner/operators show unwillingnessto cooperate with State-issued cleanup orders, actions, or permit conditionsshould be listed.EPA agrees. The Agency's stated policy is list RCRA sites where the owner/operatorhas been found to be unwilling to perform corrective action. The August9, 1988 (53 FR 30005) policy statement includes certain objective criteria(for prospective application) for determining unwillingness by RCRA owner/operators.The policy generally defines unwillingness as noncompliance with correctiveactions directed by a State or Federal authority pursuant to a RCRA orderor permit, an administrative or judicial order, or a consent decree.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Disposition of Sites in Today's Final Rule</ITAG>This final rule adds 23 sites to the final NPL; a list of these sites isat the end of this rule. This rule also drops 27 sites from the proposedNPL (Table 1). The June 24, 1988 notice addressed 39 of these sites, whichwere originally proposed in the following NPL updates:<ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Update andplusmin;1 (48 FR 40674, September 8, 1983)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Update andplusmin;2 (49 FR 40320, October 15, 1984)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Update andplusmin;3 (50 FR 14115, April 10, 1985)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Update andplusmin;4 (50 FR 37950, September 18, 1985)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The remaining 11 sites were proposed in NPL Update andplusmin;7 (53FR 23988, June 24, 1988) and Update andplusmin;8 (54 FR 19526, May 5, 1989),based on the NPL/RCRA policy. Nine of the proposed Update andplusmin;7 sitesreceived no comments and are being listed; one of the proposed Update andplusmin;7sites is being dropped because it is no longer bankrupt and therefore,no longer meets the criteria for listing under the NPL/RCA policy. Oneof the Update andplusmin;8 sites received no comments and is being listed.EPA has not reached a decision on four other sites that were proposed tobe dropped from the NPL on June 24, 1988. These sites will remain proposedfor the NPL. They are:<ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., (Mountain View Plant), MountainView, CA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Chemplex Co., Clinton/Camanche, IA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Findett Corp., St. Charles, MO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">andbullet; Burlington Northern Railroad (Somers Tie-Treating Plant),Somers, MT</ITAG>All comments submitted after the close of the comment periods associatedwith the rules proposing these sites were considered for this final rule.EPA has revised the HRS scores for 5 sites based on its review of commentsand additional information developed by EPA and the States (Table 2). Noneof the score changes has resulted in scores below the cut-off of 28.5.Some of the changes have placed the sites in different groups of 50 sites.The Agency's response to site-specific public comments and explanationsof any score changes made as a result of such comments are addressed inthe ``Support Document for the Revised National Priorities List_Final RuleCovering Sites Subject to the Subtitle C Corrective Action Authoritiesof the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, October, 1989.''<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s250,r100,13</C><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>RCRA Sites Dropped From Proposed NPL</T4><H1>State/Site name</H1><H1>Location</H1><H1>Date proposed</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">CA: FMC Corp.

Disposition of all Proposed Sites/Federal Facility Sites </ITAG>To date, EPA has proposed nine major updates to the NPL, as well as a specialupdate of two sites. A total of 213 sites remain proposed (Table 3). Atthis time, 150 sites and 63 Federal facility sites continue to be proposedpending completion of response to comments, resolution of technical issues,and various policy issues. All sites that remain proposed will be considered for future final rules.Although EPA has in the past considered late comments on proposed sitesto the extent practicable, it may not be able to do so in the future. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,xs120,r200,9/9,9/9</C><T4>Table</T4> 3._NPL <T4>Proposals</T4><H1>Update No.</H1><H1>Date/Federal Register Citation</H1><H1>Number of sites/Federal facility sites</H1><H2>Proposed</H2><H2>Remaining proposed</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">1<D>9/8/83; 48 FR 40674</D><D>132/1</D><D>1/0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2<D>10/15/84; 49 FR 40320</D><D>208/36</D><D>17/3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3<D>4/10/85; 50 FR 14115</D><D>26/6</D><D>0/1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4<D>9/18/85; 50 FR 37950</D><D>38/3</D><D>1/2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5<D>6/10/86; 51 FR 21099</D><D>43/2</D><D>8/0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6<D>1/22/87; 52 FR 2492</D><D>63/1</D><D>13/0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7<D>6/24/88; 53 FR 23988</D><D>215/14</D><D>103/5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8<D>5/5/89; 54 FR 19526</D><D>10/0</D><D>5/0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">9<D>7/14/89; 54 FR 29820</D><D>0/52</D><D>0/52</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">ATSDR<D>8/16/89; 54 FR 33846</D><D>2/0</D><D>2/0</D><R>n,n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D/><D>735/115</D><D>150/63</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Contents of the NPL </ITAG>The NPL, with the Federal facility sites in a separate section, appearsas Appendix B to the NCP at the end of the other final rule appearing intoday's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Sites on the NPL are arranged according to theirHRS scores. The 23 new sites added to the NPL in today's rule have beenincorporated into the NPL in order of their HRS scores, except where EPAmodified the order to reflect top priorities designated by the States,as discussed in section III of this rule. The NPL is presented in groups of 50 sites to emphasize that minor differencesin HRS scores do not necessarily represent significantly different levelsof risk. Except for the first group, the score range within the groups,as indicated in the list, is less than 4 points. EPA considers the siteswithin a group to have approximately the same priority for response actions.For convenience, the sites are numbered. One site_the Lansdowne Radiation site in Lansdowne, PA_was placed on theNPL because it met the requirements of the NCP at section 300.66(b)(4),as explained in section III of this rule; it has an HRS score of less than28.50, and appears at the end of the list. Each entry on the new NPL and Federal section contains the name of thefacility and the State and city or county in which it is located. In thepast, each entry was accompanied by one or more notations reflecting thestatus of response and cleanup activities at the site at the time thislist was prepared. EPA is developing a report summarizing response activitiesat NPL sites. In the interim, information on activities at the new proposedsites is available upon request to the appropriate Regional Office. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Regulatory Impact Analysis </ITAG>The costs of cleanup actions that may be taken at sites are not directlyattributable to placement on the NPL, as explained below. Therefore, theAgency has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``major'' regulationunder Executive Order 12291. EPA has conducted a preliminary analysis ofeconomic implications of today's amendment to the NCP. EPA believes thatthe kinds of economic effects associated with this revision are generallysimilar to those effects identified in the following: the regulatory impactanalysis (RIA) prepared in 1982 for the revisions to the NCP, the economicanalysis prepared when amendments to the NCP were proposed (50 FR 5882,February 12, 1985), and the economic analysis prepared for the NCP proposedrevisions of December 21, 1988 (53 FR 51471). The Agency believes the anticipatedeconomic effects related to adding 23 sites to the NPL can be characterizedin terms of the conclusions of the earlier RIA and the most recent economicanalysis. This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budgetfor review as requested by Executive Order 12291. Costs EPA has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``major'' regulation underExecutive Order 12291 because inclusion of a site on the NPL does not itselfimpose any costs. It does not establish that EPA will necessarily undertakeremedial action, nor does it require any section by a private party ordetermine its liability for site response costs. Costs that arise out ofsite responses result from site-by-site decisions about what actions totake, not directly from the act of listing itself. Nonetheless, it is usefulto consider the costs associated with responding to all sites includedin this rulemaking. The major events that follow the proposed listing of a site on the NPLare a search for potentially responsible parties and a remedial investigation/feasibilitystudy (RI/FS) to determine if remedial actions will be undertaken at asite. Design and construction of the selected remedial alternative followcompletion of the RI/FS, and operation and maintenance (Oandamp;M) activitiesmay continue after construction has been completed. EPA initially bears costs associated with responsible party searches. Responsibleparties may bear some or all the costs of the RI/FS, remedial design andconstruction, and Oandamp;M, or EPA and the States may share costs. The State cost share for site cleanup activities has been amended by section104 of SARA. For privately-owned sites, as well as at publicly-owned butnot publicly-operated sites, EPA will pay for 100% of the costs of theRI/FS and remedial planning, and 90% of the costs associated with remedialaction. The State will be responsible for 10% of the remedial action. Forpublicly-operated sites, the State cost share is at least 50% of all responsecosts at the site, including the RI/FS and remedial design and constructionof the remedial of the remedial action selected. After the remedy is built,costs fall into two categories:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; For restoration of ground water and surface water, EPA willshare in startup costs according to the criteria in the previous paragraphfor 10 years or until a sufficient level of protectiveness is achievedbefore the end of 10 years. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; For other cleanups, EPA will share for up to 1 year the costof that portion of response needed to assure that a remedy is operationaland functional. After that, the State assumes full responsibilities forOandamp;M. </ITAG>In previous NPL rulemakings, the Agency estimated the costs associatedwith these activities (RI/FS, remedial design, remedial action, and Oandamp;M)on an average per site and total cost basis. EPA will continue with thisapproach, using the most recent (1988) cost estimates available; theseestimates are presented below. However, there is wide variation in costsfor individual sites, depending on the amount, type, and extend of contamination.Additionally, EPA is unable to predict what portions of the total costsresponsible parties will bear, since the distribution of costs dependson the extent of voluntary and negotiated response and the success of anycost-recovery actions. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>   <H1>Cost category  </H1><H1>Average total cost per site </H1>a    <ITAG tagnum="1">RI/FS  <D>1,100,000  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Remedial design  <D>750,000  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Remedial action  <D/>b 13,500,000  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Net present value of Oandamp;M c  <D>3,770,000  </D><F/>a 1988 U.S. dollars.  <F/>b Includes State cost-share.  <F/>c Assumes cost of Oandamp;M over 30 years, $400,000 for the firstyear and 10% discount rate.  <F/></ITAG></ITAG>Costs to States associated with today's final rule arise from the requiredState cost-share of: (1) 10% of remedial actions and 10% of first-yearOandamp;M costs to privately-owned sites and sites which are publicly-ownedbut not publicly-operated; and (2) at least 50% of the remedial planning(RI/FS and remedial design), remedial action, and first-year Oandamp;M costsat publicly-operated sites. States will assume the cost for Oandamp;M afterEPA's period for participation. Using the assumptions developed in the1982 RIA for the NCP, EPA has assumed that 90% of the sites added to theNPL in this rule will be privately-owned and 10% will be State- or locally-operated.Therefore, using the budget projections presented above, the cost to Statesof undertaking Federal remedial planning and actions, but excluding Oandamp;Mcosts, would be approximately $59 million. State Oandamp;M costs cannot beaccurately determined because EPA, as noted above, will share Oandamp;M costsfor up to 10 years for restoration of ground water and surface water, andit is not known how many sites will require this treatment and for howlong. However, based on past experience, EPA believes a reasonable estimateis that it will share startup costs for up to 10 years at 25 percent ofsites. Using this estimate, State Oandamp;M costs would be approximately$66 million.  Placing a hazardous waste site on the final NPL does not itself cause firmsresponsible for the site to bear costs. Nonetheless, a listing may inducefirms to clean up the sites voluntarily, or it may act as a potential triggerfor subsequent enforcement or cost-recovery actions. Such actions may imposecosts on firms, but the decisions to take such actions are discretionaryand made on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, precise estimates of theseeffects cannot be made. EPA does not believe that every site will be cleanedup by a responsible party. EPA cannot project at this time which firmsor industry sectors will bear specific portions of the response costs,but the Agency considers: the volume and nature of the waste at the sites;the strength of the evidence linking the wastes at the site to the parties;the parties' ability to pay; and other factors when deciding whether andhow to proceed against the parties.  Economy-wide effects of this amendment are aggregations of effects on firmsand State and local governments. Although effects could be felt by someindividual firms and States, the total impact of this revision on output,prices, and employment is expected to be negligible at the national level. <ITAG tagnum="84">Benefits  </ITAG>The real benefits associated with today's amendment placing additionalsites on the NPL are increased health and environmental protection as aresult of increased public awareness of potential hazards. In additionto the potential for more Federally-financed remedial actions, expansionof the NPL could accelerate privately-financed, voluntary cleanup efforts.Listing sites as national priority targets may also give States increasedsupport for funding responses at particular sites.  As a result of the additional CERCLA remedies, there will be lower exposureto high-risk chemicals, and higher-quality surface water, ground water,soil, and air. These benefits are expected to be significant, althoughdifficult to estimate in advance of completing the RI/FS at these sites. <ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis  </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires EPA to review the impactof this action on small entities or certify that the action will not havea significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. By smallentities, the Act refers to small businesses, small government jurisdictions,and nonprofit organizations.  While modifications to the NPL are considered revisions to the NCP, theyare not typical regulatory changes since the revisions do not automaticallyimpose costs. The placing of sites on the NPL does not in itself requireany action of any private party, nor does it determine the liability ofany party for the cost of cleanup at the site. Further, no identifiablegroups are affected as a whole. As a consequence, it is hard to predictimpacts on any group. Placing a site on the NPL could increase the likelihoodthat adverse impacts to responsible parties (in the form of cleanup costs)will occur, but EPA cannot identify the potentially affected business atthis time nor estimate the number of small businesses that might be affected. The Agency does expect that certain industries and firms within industriesthat have caused a proportionately high percentage of waste site problemscould be significantly affected by CERCLA actions. However, EPA does notexpect the impact from the listing of these 23 sites to have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small businesses.  In any case, economic impacts would only occur through enforcement andcost-recovery actions, which are taken at EPA's discretion on a site-by-sitebasis. EPA considers many factors when determining what enforcement actionsto take, including not only the firm's contribution to the problem, butalso the firm's ability to pay.  The impacts (from cost recovery) on small governments and nonprofit organizationswould be determined on a similar case-by-case basis.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 300  </ITAG>Air pollution control, Chemicals, Hazardous materials, Intergovernmentalrelations, Natural resources, Oil pollution, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Superfund, Waste treatment and disposal, Water pollutioncontrol, Water supply.  <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 26, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan Z.
