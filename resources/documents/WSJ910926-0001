Yesterday, as European paratroopers guarded nervousexpatriates fleeing the African country in chartered boatsand aircraft, sporadic fighting claimed at least its 30thvictim in three days of rioting. The European relief groupDoctors Without Borders said as many as 1,750 people werewounded in the capital of Kinshasa alone.</LP><TEXT>   The violence was ignited by mutinous soldiers who areangry at not being paid for several months. But in thepolitical tinderbox of central Africa, the unrest turned intocivilian rioting and looting. Zaire, one of the poorestcountries on the continent despite huge natural resources, isalso one of the countries that has most resisted the tide ofactivism for greater multiparty democracy that's risingacross Africa. The latest upheaval underscores that such atide, against a backdrop of economic despair, can't berestrained indefinitely.   The French and Belgian governments reiterated calls toPresident Mobutu Sese Seko to allow greater democracy in thecountry he has ruled for 26 years. Meanwhile, more than 1,000French and Belgian paratroopers have helped evacuate 700people to nearby Zambia, Zimbabwe, Congo and South Africa,the Associated Press reported. The U.S., meanwhile, sentplanes to evacuate Americans, and the Pentagon said it wouldlend several transport planes to France to help carryadditional troops.   Some skeptical opposition leaders claimed Mr. Mobutuhimself may have incited the military unrest to provokeWestern intervention and thereby bolster his grip on power,the AP reported. But whether he stays in power or not, it'sclear that pressure for democratic change is building in hiscountry and throughout central Africa. Zaire has been inchaos for weeks amid conflict between pro-Mobutu forces andpro-democracy activists pushing for a national conference.   The tension in Zaire is similar to that elsewhere in theregion, where most governments are wrestling with calls forgreater freedom and openness. Typical of the pro-democracyadvocates is economist Celestin Monga, who lives in Cameroonand is among a growing list of economists, politicalscientists and lawyers who have left campuses in the West topush for change at home.   &quot;For too long we blamed the colonial powers for all ourproblems. I think it is time we claimed a littleresponsibility for ourselves,&quot; says the opposition politicalleader. &quot;We have potential. What we need is change.&quot;   But while an earlier generation of African radicalsexalted Lenin and Marx, today's activists echo ThomasJefferson and Adam Smith. They seek political pluralism andfree speech, less state involvement in the economy and moreentrepreneurship. They criticize government corruption andinefficiency. But their solution is privatization, notcentralization.   &quot;No one wants to make an investment&quot; until the state'srole in the economy is curbed, says Mr. Monga in a livingroom whose bookshelves overflow with works by Westernanti-communists and liberals. The government &quot;doesn't want tosupport anything that isn't in its personal interest.&quot;   The charismatic, outspoken Mr. Monga was jailed earlierthis year after writing an essay critical of longtimeCameroon President Paul Biya. Though he has since been freed,life is far from normal. Police last month seized hispassport without explanation. He and others live in fear ofbeing jailed again.   From Mauritania to Zaire, opposition political groups arechallenging the one-party rulers and military dictators whohave dominated African politics since decolonization. In&quot;samizdat&quot; articles and at political demonstrations,activists push for democracy and greater freedom ofexpression. Countries where pressure for change isintensifying include Cameroon, Congo, Ivory Coast, Nigeria,Zambia and Madagascar.   It is difficult to talk with Mr. Monga and not beencouraged about prospects for Cameroon and the rest ofAfrica. Of course, unfulfilled promise has disappointed manyhere before, and people are skeptical that talk will resultin anything concrete this time. Economies here barelyfunction because of inefficiency and mismanagement. Peoplelive in desperate conditions. And progress will be difficult.   But Mr. Monga and his colleagues offer a glimmer of hope.   Agitation for change in Cameroon is growing. TheFrance-sized country of 11 million is starting the thirdmonth of a general strike called by nearly 30 oppositiongroups against the one-party rule and corruption of PresidentBiya's government. Djeukam Tchameni, a Cameroon oppositionleader who heads a political association called Capliberte,says &quot;frustration with the absence of democracy is buildingto the point where people rise up and resist.&quot;   Mr. Tchameni says Cameroon's leadership fosters cronyismand inefficiency instead of protecting property rights andentrepreneurship. &quot;Thirty years ago, we rose up againstcolonialism. But we can't blame that any more,&quot; he says. &quot;Ourleaders are responsible for the mess we are in. There is toomuch corruption and too much wasted spending.&quot;   The general strike has halted 80% of all economicactivity, diplomats say. In Douala, Cameroon's businesscenter, stores and businesses are closed. Dozens of youngmen, without jobs, loiter in the streets. They spend the daytalking with old men wearing traditional robes called bobosand with peddlers balancing bananas and French bread on theirheads.   Amina Ramadou, a housewife, says the situation has neverbeen so bad. &quot;We can't take much more of this. We used tohave some money. Now there is nothing.&quot; She has her ownsuggestion to solve the economic crisis: &quot;We send three sacksof angry bees to the governor and the president. And someants which bite. Maybe they eat the government and solve ourproblems.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
