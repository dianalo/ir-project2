The company said it will post a balance-sheet loss, which represents net results after additions to reported reserves, of about 200 million marks ($119.7 million) for 1987, the first such loss in KHD's history. The loss will include charges to cover the costs of restructuring and layoffs. KHD is especially reliant on the energy, raw-materials, machinery and agricultural industries, all of which have been depressed for several years. It has done little to diversify, analysts said.    The company also said that Chairman Bodo Liebe, who will retire Dec. 31, will be succeeded by Kajo Neunkirchen, formally the head of the German division of the Swedish ball-bearings maker Svenska Kullagerfabriken AB. </TEXT></DOC>
