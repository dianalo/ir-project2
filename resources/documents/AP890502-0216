Bush and members of the House Select Committee on NarcoticsAbuse and Control had what was termed a spirited meeting at theWhite House, with the lawmakers presenting assorted concerns aboutdrug education, interdiction, regional approaches and treatment.   After the session, William J. Bennett, director of the Office ofNational Drug Control Policy, said that ``we're not going to bepinch-penny in this war on drugs. We're going to have a fiscallyresponsible policy, but choices are going to have to be made.''   Considerable discussion focused on Bennett's decision to makethe District of Columbia an area for intensive anti-drug activitybefore completing an overall national strategy, the participantssaid. Committee members also said they appreciated gaining accessto Bush.   ``It was a positive and preliminary meeting,'' said Rep. MelLevine, D-Calif. ``The very fact that the meeting was held issignificant, and a good step for the administration. ... PresidentBush is willing to work with Congress in a way that PresidentReagan was not. He got high marks for having the meeting.''   Bennett promised to seek additional congressional views andagreed to meet with the committee next week to further discuss drugpolicy.   ``Most people believe that the effort has to be made on manyfronts. But some choices will have to be made, too, ... aboutpriorities,'' Bennett said. Choices involve ``what gets more, whatgets the same, where do we throw our weight,'' he added.   He said all members of Congress have been asked forrecommendations. He added that officials will not know how much theanti-drug program will cost until various agencies provideprojections involving the various aspects.   No policy decisions were made at the meeting.   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., the House committee chairman,said he had wanted assurances from Bush that Bennett's drug policycoordinating energy ``is not consumed'' by the push Bennettannounced for the capital city.   ``It was pointed out that when we were drafting the bill'' thatcreated the drug coordinator position, ``we hd considered him tolend his expertise to developing a domestic and foreign policy andnot one for the district,'' Rangel said.   Rangel avoided direct criticism of Bennett, and said he wassatisfied that the administration has promised to have aninternational conference on drugs after the drug policy review isfinished in early September.   Rangel previously voiced objections that the administration wasnot taking enough of a global approach. He said the StateDepartment should include drug policy in the government's foreignpolicy considerations with drug-producing countries.   The meeting ended with a pledge of cooperation on anti-drugpolicy between the Bush administration and Congress, theparticipants said.   Rangel predicted there will be no sharp conflict as long as theadministration keeps Congress advised rather than waiting until apolicy is complete and then going to Congress to consult.   Bennett said the government's effort in Washington is not asubstitute for a national strategy, which is being developed by thegovernment now, but is part of the overall strategy. He said hepersonally is spending little time on the Washington effort,leaving that to various government departments.</TEXT></DOC>
