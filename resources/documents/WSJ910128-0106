The Swiss airline said a preliminary study on thefeasibility of the proposed merger would be completed in thespring and that a decision would be taken then &quot;on whether,and if so how, to proceed.&quot; Swissair said the new companywould combine the employees, hardware, software and otherinformation-technology resources of Swissair and SAS, andthat the two airlines would then become customers of the newcompany, as could other airlines.   Swissair cited cost-saving opportunities as well as&quot;synergic benefits&quot; as reasons for the proposed merger. &quot;Themain emphasis here will be on computer-reservations systems,which are playing an increasingly vital role inairline-management activities,&quot; Swissair said.   Each airline employs about 800 people in itsinformation-technology operations, Swissair said.                                                                                                          HELP FOR ALGERIA                                                                                                          The European Investment Bank has loaned Algeria 22 millionEuropean currency units ($30.4 million) for drainage andirrigation systems in the Sahara. The bank, which is theEuropean Community's banking institution for long-termfinance, said the money would be spent by the AlgerianMinistry of Equipment to help cultivate date palms on newlyirrigated land in the Oued R'hir Valley. The new plantation,which is about 370 miles southeast of Algiers, is also beingfinanced by the World Bank.                                                                                                          SLUGGISH GROWTH                                                                                                          Swiss Bank Corp. Chairman Peter G. Rogge saidSwitzerland's gross national product is likely to grow at asluggish 1% this year if the war in the Persian Gulf is shortbut warned that the country might slip into a recession ifthe war escalates and expands to other countries in theMiddle East. Mr. Rogge noted that even with a brief war,Switzerland would be confronted with &quot;unacceptable priceincreases&quot; of about 5% on a year-to-year basis in the comingsix months.                                                                                                          SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL                                                                                                          The European Community has decided in principle to goahead with a joint EC-Israeli scientific-cooperation meetingthat was put off last year because of dismay with Israelitreatment of Palestinians, community sources said. No date orplace has been set yet. The decision was apparently anattempt to signal support for the Jewish state's restraint inresponding to Iraqi missile attacks.                                                                                                          ROMANIA'S DOLDRUMS                                                                                                          Romanians produced and exported far less in 1990 thanunder the former communist dictatorship, according to theNational Statistics Commission. Industrial production wasonly 80% of what it was in 1989, and labor productivity only79%. Exports plummeted to 58% of the 1989 figure, whileimports rose by 12%. Imports of consumer goods, however, roseby 390%. Agricultural output dropped by 3%.                                                                                                          FIGHTING ARGENTINE CORRUPTION                                                                                                          Argentine President Carlos Menem said he would soon make apublic declaration of his personal wealth and would order topofficials to do likewise as part of an anti-corruptioncampaign. Corruption &quot;is a sickness . . . a cancer . . . acalamity . . . a moral emergency,&quot; Mr. Menem said,acknowledging that reports of official corruption haveundermined confidence in his 18-month-old government. He saidhe would double the budget of the agency that investigatesadministrative corruption.

Following oil-price increases of about 30% late last year,prices of daily necessities, including foods and services,have risen by as much as 40% so far this year, officials say.   To keep this year's inflation rate below 10%, thegovernment will postpone major public construction projectsuntil the second half, the report said. A total of onetrillion won ($13.9 billion) of projects will be thusdeferred, the report added. At the same time, thegovernment's policy to keep wage increases at below 10% thisyear will be strictly enforced.   An additional one trillion won of social-infrastructureprojects such as roads, ports or dams will be carried outduring the first half of this year as originally scheduled,the report said. In fact, the government will increasespending on infrastructure, which has been neglected duringthe past decade because of a tight budgetary policy,officials said.
