Yochum was passed over forchairman of Westinghouse Electric Corp. four years ago, thechief financial officer took early retirement. Now, thecompany that spurned Mr. Yochum has asked him to return torescue its beleaguered financial services unit.   Mr. Yochum, 64 years old, dismisses speculation that hisreturn vindicates him. &quot;I'm not trying to prove anything toanybody,&quot; he says adamantly.</LP><TEXT>   But the finance unit has plenty to prove. Ridden with badreal estate loans, it posted a third-quarter loss of $1.12billion as the parent company took a $1.68 billion pretaxcharge.   As the new chairman of Westinghouse Financial ServicesInc., Mr. Yochum must minimize future losses by selling offtroubled assets. He also needs to restore the financialunit's credibility, which has been eroded by the company'sfailure to fully acknowledge the extent of its problems.Westinghouse in February announced a pretax charge of $975million against fourth-quarter 1990 earnings, and last yearthe company predicted a &quot;respectable year&quot; for the financialunit in 1991.   Credibility is one asset Mr. Yochum brings to the job.Says William A. Coates, a retired Westinghouse executive vicepresident: &quot;Leo Yochum reeks of credibility. If I were a bondrating man and Leo said something was going to happen, I'dput a lot of credence into what he said.&quot;   &quot;People trust him,&quot; adds analyst John Frankola ofParker/Hunter, Pittsburgh.   Mr. Yochum succeeds William A. Powe, who was given theposition of &quot;special consultant&quot; to the unit. Mr. Yochum for17 years oversaw the credit unit as chief financial officerof the parent company. He joined Westinghouse in 1951 butleft the company after John C. Marous was named chairman in1987. Retired Chairman Douglas Danforth says the boardseriously considered Mr. Yochum for the top spot but optedfor Mr. Marous instead. Mr. Yochum was asked to return by Mr.Marous's successor, Paul E. Lego.   The executive, a West Virginia native and sports buff,decided to sacrifice the leisure of retirement because of hiscorporate loyalty. &quot;You put in 37 years with an institutionand you develop some loyalties and some friends,&quot; he says.   A no-nonsense manager with a dry wit, Mr. Yochum roserapidly through Westinghouse and helped the company divestkey businesses like home appliances and cable TV systems. Hedeveloped a reputation as a strategic thinker and a financialexpert, though his lack of operations experience was onereason he didn't get the top job.   Mr. Yochum, who lives outside Pittsburgh, traveled widelyduring his retirement with his wife, Janie, and the couplespent one week a month at their Manhattan apartment on theUpper East Side. &quot;I'll still be taking a lot of trips to NewYork but for different reasons,&quot; he says.   When Westinghouse needed a new chairman for the financeunit, Mr. Yochum, who had years of experience dealing withthe board, was seen as a natural choice. &quot;Leo's better knownto the people on the board than almost anybody atWestinghouse,&quot; says Don Povejsil, a retired Westinghouseexecutive. Mr. Yochum also was named to the Westinghouseboard.   Before accepting the job, Mr. Yochum says he studied thefinancial unit's loan portfolio and talked to the company'soutside investment advisers. &quot;I decided that this matterdoes, indeed, have a solution,&quot; he says, although he won'telaborate.   In the short term, the company will raise $900 million inequity and cut 4,000 jobs companywide. The financial serviceunit will try to sell off its troubled loans and recover asmany cents on the dollar as possible.   Once the loan portfolio is stabilized, most observersbelieve Westinghouse will sell the credit unit. But for nowMr. Yochum urged patience. &quot;As good as I am, I don't have itdone yet,&quot; he says, then adds, &quot;But don't put that in thepaper.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
