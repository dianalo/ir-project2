There havebeen inquiries from the public which suggest that there are uncertaintieswith respect to the effect that a voluntary self-disclosure may have onthe treatment of violations. By publishing the practice of the Bureau ofExport Administration with respect to voluntary self-disclosures, thisrule will reduce that uncertainty.  Depending on the facts and circumstances of each case, the voluntary self-disclosureof a violation will ordinarily be a mitigating factor which the Bureauof Export Administration will consider, along with other aggravating andmitigating factors, when determining the appropriate administration sanction,if any, to be imposed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments should be received by April 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments (six copies) should be sent to: WilliamH.

This rule is consistent with Executive Order 12291 and 12661.  2. This rule contains a collection of information subject to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h) <T3>et seq.</T3>) and has been submitted to the Office of Management andBudget for review. The public reporting burden for this collection of informationis estimated to average 10 hours per response, including the time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Office of Security and Management Support, Bureau of Export Administration,U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, and to the Office ofManagement and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (0694-xxxx), Washington,DC 20503. This rule will not be published in final form until and unlessthe Department of Commerce has obtained the approval to do so from theOffice of Management and Budget. Further, in accordance with 5 CFR 1320.13and 1320.15:a. The title for this collection of information is ``the procedure forthe voluntary self-disclosure of violations of the Export AdministrationRegulations''.   b. The information is needed to detect violations of the Export AdministrationAct and Regulations. It will be used to determine whether an investigationor prosecution is necessary and to reach settlements with violators.  c. The likely respondents will be export-related businesses.   3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)), no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.   4. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. Section 13(b) of theExport Administration Act does not require that this rule be publishedin proposed form because this rule does not impose a control on exports.Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking andan opportunity for public comment be given for this rule.   However, consistent with the intent of Congress set forth in section 13(b)of the Export Administration Act to provide public participation in rulemaking,these regulations are issued in proposed form and comments will be consideredin developing final regulations.   The period for submission of comments will close April 5, 1989. The Departmentwill consider all comments received before the close of the comment periodin developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of thecomment period will be considered if possible, but their considerationcannot be assured. The Department will not accept public comments accompaniedby a request that part or all of the material be treated confidentiallybecause of its business proprietary nature or for any other reason. TheDepartment will return such comments and materials to the person submittingthe comments and will not consider them in the development of final regulations.All public comments on these regulations will be a matter of public recordand will be available for public inspection and copying. In the interestof accuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in writtenform. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will alsobe a matter of public record and will be available for public review andcopying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government orforeign governments will not be made available for public inspection.  The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in theBureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records InspectionFacility, Room H-4886, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and ConstitutionAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, includingwritten public comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oralcommunications, may be inspected and copied in accordance with the regulationspublished in Part 4 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Informationabout the inspection and copying of records at the facility may be obtainedfrom Margaret Cornejo, Bureau of Export Administration, Freedom of InformationOfficer, at the above address or by calling (202) 377-2593.   5. This proposed rule does not contain policies with Federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 787</ITAG>Exports, Enforcement, Criminal and administrative sanctions, Penalties,Violations, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 787_[AMENDED]</ITAG>Accordingly, Part 787 of the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFRParts 700-799) is proposed to be amended as follows: 1.

Upon completion of the review,the person should prepare and submit to the Office of Export Intelligencea detailed narrative account, supported by appropriate documentation, ofall the suspected violations. (2) <T3>Initial notification. </T3>(i) Ordinarily, the initial notificationshould be in writing and sent to the address set forth in andSection; 787.15(c)(7).The notification should include the name of the person making the disclosureand a brief description of the suspected violations.(ii) The Office of Export Intelligence recognizes that there will be situationswhere it will not be practical to make the initial notification in writing.For example, this could occur if a shipment leaves the United States withoutthe required export license and there may still be an opportunity to preventacquisition of the commodities or technical data by unauthorized persons.In these situations, the Office of Export Intelligence should be contactedpromptly at (202) 377-8208.(3) <T3>Narrative account. </T3>After the initial notification, a thoroughreview should be conducted of all export-related transactions where possibleviolations are suspected. The Office of Export Intelligence suggests thatthe review cover a period of five years prior to the date of the initialnotification. Upon completion of the review, the Office of Export Intelligenceshould be furnished with a narrative account that sufficiently describesthe suspected violations so that the Office of Export Enforcement and theOffice of Export Intelligence can assess their nature and gravity. Thenarrative account should also describe the nature of the review conductedand measures which may have been taken to minimize the likelihood thatviolations will occur in the future. Where appropriate, the narrative acountshould include, but is not limited to:(i) The kind of violation involved, <T3>e.g., </T3>an unlicensed shipment, dealing with a party denied U.S.export privileges;(ii) An explanation of when and how the violations occurred;(iii) The complete identities and addresses of all individuals and organizations,whether foreign or domestic, involved in the activities giving rise tothe violations; (iv) Export license numbers;(v) Commodity classification numbers, product descriptions and quantities,and value in U.S. dollars of the commodities or technical data involved;and (vi) A description of any mitigating circumstances.
