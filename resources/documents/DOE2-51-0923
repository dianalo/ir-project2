Tensilestrength testing was conducted on as-sprayed and thermally cycled testspecimens which were plasma sprayed with 0.020 to 0.100 in. coating thicknesses.Satisfactory tensile strength values were observed in the as-sprayedtensile specimens. There was essentially no decrease in tensile strengthafter thermally cycling the tensile specimens. Furthermore, compressorhousings were plasma sprayed and thermally cycled in a 150-hr enginetest and a 200-hr actual flight test during which the turbine enginewas operated at a variety of loads, speeds and torques. The plasma sprayedcoating system showed no evidence of degradation or delamination fromthe compressor housings. As a result of these tests, a procedure wasdesigned and developed for the application of an aluminum-silicon alloyin order to reclaim T55-L-712 turbine engine compressor housings.</TEXT></DOC>
