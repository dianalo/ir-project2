Power Entertaining may be next.    To cushion the leap into the dog-eat-dog business world, De Land, Fla.'s Stetson University School of Business Administration this fall is offering a 12-part seminar with a major section dubbed &quot;power entertaining.&quot;    Classes will focus on such powerful topics as social conversation (&quot;avoid being judgmental&quot;), etiquette (&quot;stand up when a person enters the room&quot;), planning for social occasions (&quot;seat the honored guest on the hostess's right&quot;), dressing for success and, in case of overseas clients, cross-cultural entertaining.    &quot;As the students become emerging professional types, they're going to be expected to host social occasions,&quot; says marketing professor Stephen Barnett, who thought up the idea. &quot;Unless you've read a book on it or come from a family that did a lot of entertaining,&quot; there isn't much chance to learn it, he notes.    While teaching a sales management course last spring, Mr. Barnett recruited Margaret Lee, wife of Stetson President H. Douglas Lee, to give a few lectures on entertaining -- and she was impressed with the students' interest. So Stetson agreed to give the concept some more, well, power, and offer the non-credit program.    This type of course isn't yet standard fare at other business schools. A Stanford University spokesman says the closest thing its business school offers -- besides a &quot;dress for success&quot; student fashion show -- is a course on &quot;Power and Politics.&quot; Harvard and Columbia business schools have equally slim pickings. Wharton has an &quot;Executive Life Style&quot; seminar series on skills from wine tasting and stress management to executive dressing.    Business schools &quot;are scared of it {teaching entertaining} now. But five years from now, they'll all have it,&quot; says Letitia Baldrige, who wrote a book on executive manners and lectures at Wharton. &quot;We're not talking about being aristocratic. We're talking about being efficient.&quot;    Mr. Barnett concedes his brainchild initially &quot;got a lot of ribbing from the faculty.&quot; But, he notes, studies of group dynamics show he's not entirely out to lunch: &quot;The person who plans a good party is the same person who's a good manager when you get a group together.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
