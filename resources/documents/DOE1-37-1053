The guidebook southeast willaddress the complete spectrum of biomass energy resources that can beused in the southeast region, to dramatically illustrate the potentialof biomass fuels. It will be targeted toward those plant managers andengineers who could readily use a biofueled system, but who are not knowledgeableabout or aware of biofuel cogeneration potential and applications. Thebook will emphasize an applications and systems level understanding.It will cover the broad spectrum of issues that must be addressed fora biofueled cogeneration project, ranging from decision economics toplanning, design, operation, and legal and environmental concerns. Detailedtechnical information will be limited to biofuel characteristics, anarea where engineers' standard reference documents may be inadequate.</TEXT></DOC>
