The news came as the Soviet news agency Tass reported thatAfghan rebels staged a rocket attack on their capital of Kabul,killing one person and wounding three.   Tass, quoting Afghanistan's official Bakhtar news agency, saidseveral houses were damaged by the ground-to-ground missiles. Itgave no further details.   The attack was the latest in a series on Kabul and other Afghancities by rebels seeking to topple the Marxist government ofPresident Najib.   The seven-party Afghan Guerrilla Alliance, based in Pakistan'sfrontier city of Peshawar, said in a news release in Islamabad thattwo prisoners of war were being freed as a ``good-will gesture.''   Ahmad Gailani, chairman of the alliance, said the Soviet Union'sreaction to the prisoner release would decide the fate of Soviettroops still held by Afghan guerrillas. The Soviets say 312soldiers are missing in Afghanistan.   The alliance wants to hold direct talks with the Soviet Union,both about imprisoned Soviet soldiers and the peaceful withdrawalof Red Army troops from Afghanistan.   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, another guerrilla leader, said at a newsconference in Islamabad that the Soviet Union must initiate talks.   Azim Nasser Zia, with Gailani's National Islamic Front ofAfghanistan, said the Soviet Union had ``already'' indicated awillingness to talk about prisoners of war but the guerrillaswanted talks expanded to include other issues, including the Sovietwithdrawal.   The Soviets began withdrawing troops from Afghanistan May 15.Under the terms of a U.N.-brokered accord signed in April, it mustwithdraw half of its more than 100,000 estimated troops by Aug. 15and the rest by next Feb. 15.   Guerrilla leaders have said that until the Soviet Union opensdirect talks with them, they cannot guarantee safe passage forwithdrawing troops.   The Kremlin ordered troops and tanks into Afghanistan inDecember 1979 to prop up the communist government there.   Since the Soviets began their pullout, official Soviet andAfghan media have been reporting a sharp increase in attacks onAfghan cities by the mostly Moslem guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
