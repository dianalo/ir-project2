(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Veterans of successful efforts to limitthe number of years lawmakers stay in office offered adviceThursday on how to throw the rascals out. Lesson No. 1: Don't call'em rascals.   ``Most of them aren't rascals,'' said Colorado state Sen. TerryConsidine, who backed his state's term-limiting law. ``They come toit (lawmaking) with a good heart.''   Considine spoke at a daylong conference attended by more than100 people from at least 20 states who say they are part of agrowing national movement to get rid of the ``career lawmaker.''   ``People are organizing in all 50 states,'' said Paul Beckner,executive director of Citizens for Congressional Reform inWashington, D.C., another conference panelist. ``It's clear we havea broad-based movement.''   Considine's panel comprised political activists who ledvictorious campaigns to limit the terms and re-election bids oflegislators in California, Colorado and Oklahoma.   Negative campaigns are tempting but unwise, they said. Recenthistory offers the best illustration. Despite widespread anger atpoliticians for such blunders as the savings and loan crisis,voters across the country in 1990 reelected 97 percent ofincumbents running for state and congressional offices.   Instead, the activists said, campaigns to limit service in thestate houses and Congress should emphasize a return to a citizenlegislature: the people's government intended by the nation'sfounders.   ``What we need is citizen legislators who call it like they seeit then return home to their real jobs,'' sais Considine.   The movement, if it is one, has a sense of humor. In Oregon theeffort to limit lawmakers' tenure goes by the slogan: LetIncumbents Mosey Into The Sunset, or LIMITS.   Ed Crane, president of the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.,which does policy analysis, said the public no longer wants careerlegislators but people who view service as their civic duty.   ``What we want are people in a citizen legislature who viewthemselves as on a leave of absence from their real jobs,'' Cranesaid. ``This movement is an opportunity for Americans to regaincontrol of their government.''   Crane warned that the grass roots movement, though widelysupported, could be hurt if politicians support it. That includesPresident Bush, who will call for limits on congressional termsduring his State of the Union address next month. That wasdisclosed earlier this week by Chief of Staff John Sununu, thoughhe didn't give specifics.   ``It would be much better if the movement were citizen-led,'' hesaid. ``Bush and (Vice President Dan) Quayle did real damage whenthey came to this state to support Proposition 140.''   Colorado voters this year approved limits of eight years inoffice for members of both chambers of their state legislature.They also approved a limit of 12 years in office for their U.S.senators and representatives. The first such initiative to dealwith jobs in Congress, conference organizers said.   The California referendum, which passed in November with 52percent of the vote, set limits of three two-year terms forAssembly members and two four-year terms for state senators. Thelaw also limited state executives, including the governor, to twofour-year terms.   In Oklahoma this year voters approved a limit of 12 years inoffice for their state lawmakers.</TEXT></DOC>
