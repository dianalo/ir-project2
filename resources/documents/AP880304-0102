The mediator said allsubstantial differences had been worked out.   The head of the Pakistani delegation, acting Foreign MinisterZain Noorani, flew back to Islamabad for weekend consultations withthe country's political leaders, including oppositionrepresentatives.   The meeting will mark the first time the Pakistan government hassought direct contact with its opposition since President Gen.Mohammad Zia Ul-haq seized power and imposed martial in July 1977coup.   Pakistan has represented Afghanistan's anti-Marxist Moslemguerrillas in the peace talks.   The two sides agreed Thursday to a nine-month timetable for thepullout of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, with half the estimated115,000 troops to be withdrawn in the first 90 days.   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez said no major differences remained.But the negotiators did not resolve the issue of what governmentwould be in power in Afghanistan to oversee implementation of asettlement.   Over the weekend, Pakistan will try to decide whether it iswilling to sign a settlement with President Najib's government,which it does not recognize.   Noorani said there was no change in Pakistan's position that thesettlement should be accompanied by formation of a transitionalgovernment in Kabul to prevent more bloodshed.   Not all opposition parties have declared their stand onAfghanistan but most have urged the government to sign a Sovietpullout accord, then worry about a political settlement later.   The Geneva talks are set to resume Monday.   Cordovez told reporters that that the withdrawal issue had longstalled the almost 6-year-old negotiations. He said its resolutionmeant a ``significant step'' toward concluding a settlement.   ``I am not going to consider that these documents are absolutelyready until they are signed and sealed,'' he said, but also statedrepeatedly that the ``remaining differences are not of substance.''   ``There is no doubt about the political significance of theagreements reached this week and also of some understandings thathave started to evolve'' regarding other oustanding problems, hesaid.   He did not elaborate but made plain that he is increasinglyconfident that there will be an eventual accord on the future shapeof the Kabul government.   Cordovez said that both Kabul and Islamabad recognized that abroad-based Afghan government would make a settlement ``moreeffective,'' although their concepts differ.   He also said he believed that the Afghan resistance movement,which is flatly opposed to any power-sharing with the presentleadership, will change its attitude once a settlement is complete.   The chief Afghan delegate, Abdul Wakil, reiterated Thursday thatKabul was ready to talk with all political forces, including theresistance movements, about the formation of new government.   A three-member team from the office of the U.N. Commissioner forRefugees returned to Geneva today from a fact-finding visit inAfghanistan.   A spokeswoman, Judith Kumin, said the team followed aninvitation of the Kabul government. She said it was evident thatthe office would have a role in repatriating the more than 5million Afghan refugees once a settlement was reached.   An estimated 3 million refugees are in Pakistan, and another 2million are in Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
