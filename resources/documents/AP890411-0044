Guerrillas were to congregate at designated points so they canbe escorted to Angola under an agreement by South Africa, Angolaand Cuba.   The agreement was reached in an effort to end fighting betweenSouth African-led security forces and the guerrillas in northernNamibia. The bloodshed began April 1, the day a U.N.-sponsoredtruce was to begin as part of Namibia's transition to independenceafter 74 years of South African rule.   Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand of Namibia's paramilitary policereported ``a few skirmishes'' with South-West Africa People'sOrganization guerrillas today and Monday.   Du Rand put the latest death toll in the fighting at 265guerrillas and 28 security force members.   He said there was no sign that guerrillas were honoring anagreement to cross the border north to Angola.   ``About 10 small groups of three to seven men each have crossedinto Angola since Sunday, but that could be to re-supply themselvesor to rest,'' du Rand said. ``There is no indication of any majormovement north to the assembly points.''   South Africa says about 1,900 SWAPO fighters began enteringNamibia on April 1, violating the U.N. agreement that calls for theguerrillas to remain at their Angola bases until mid-May.   It said the incursion might have been a deliberate attempt totake advantage of the late deployment of a U.N. monitoring force,and thus influence Namibian elections later in the year.   Some Namibian observers said SWAPO units apparently did not knowthey were breaking the peace accord by entering the territory.   SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma contended in Angola that some guerrillashad been in Namibia all along, and had a right to be there. OnSunday, reportedly under pressure from his Angolan and Cubanallies, Nujoma ordered his fighters to leave Namibia.   U.N. representative Martti Ahtisaari said messages were beingbroadcast on radio advising guerrillas to go to churches in thenorth as a preliminary step before reporting to U.N. assemblypoints.   Nujoma said Monday in a radio interview with the BritishBroadcasting Corp. that there is confusion about how to spread wordof the withdrawal to his fighters. He said radio broadcasts wereuseless because the guerrillas had no radios.   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I and, until lastyear, defied U.N. resolutions demanding that it withdraw. It hasagreed to a U.N.-brokered regional peace accord with Cuba andAngola.   Under the agreement, Cuba is pulling 50,000 troops out ofAngola, where they had fought Angolan rebels backed by South Africa.   About 100 British and Australian troops moved into northernNamibia under the U.N. flag Monday to help monitor the SWAPOpullout. The guerrillas had until Saturday to leave but LouisPienaar, South African administrator general in Namibia, said thedeadline might not be strictly enforced if SWAPO needed more time.   In Oshakati, a military stronghold in northern Namibia, policeChief Inspector Derek Brune said helicopter gunships were usedMonday in a skirmish at Ruacana, near the Angolan border.   ``We are not going out to look for SWAPO at this stage. We aregiving them a chance to gather at the assembly points,'' he said.   Ahtisaari said no official cease-fire was in effect but thatSouth Africa would restrain its forces.   Ahtisaari said each assembly point would be staffed by 10 U.N.soldiers and five monitors, and would fly blue and white U.N.flags. He said other U.N. personnel, monitoring the Cubanwithdrawal in Angola, would escort SWAPO fighters to Angolan bases.</TEXT></DOC>
