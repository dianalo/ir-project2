He had just finished an article for the New Yorker, and a fact checker from the magazine showed up at his home to quiz him on it, a process that lasted several hours. &quot;Finally,&quot; he recalls, &quot;my wife said, 'Would you please leave the house so we can get married?'&quot;    But when Mr. Auletta, whose five books include &quot;Greed and Glory on Wall Street,&quot; gives manuscripts to a book publisher, it's another story. &quot;There is no fact checking,&quot; he says.    That difference is at the heart of a long-running debate over whether book publishers should be more responsible for their authors' accuracy. While publishers routinely check grammar and spelling, and often have lawyers read manuscripts they think may be challenged by libel suits, they rarely investigate further. Many authors and academics argue that such habits are encouraging a flood of inaccurate and poorly researched books.    Much of the controversy involves books in the murky &quot;pop-psychology&quot; genre, which touch on everything from self-awareness to management techniques. Recently, Srully Blotnick, an author of several popular business books, was dropped as a Forbes magazine columnist after questions arose about the authenticity of a study on which he had based several books and columns. (Mr. Blotnick defends the integrity of his research.)    &quot;There's an enormous number of books out there from very unqualified people,&quot; contends Pepper Schwartz, a University of Washington sociology professor and co-author of &quot;American Couples,&quot; a study of the life styles of 12,000 couples. &quot;They collect data in such a way as to make it undependable.&quot; Publishers, she adds, say, &quot;'The buyer beware.' I honestly think they have lost sight of their responsibility.&quot;    At university presses, manuscripts are regularly sent out to be vetted by academic specialists before they are purchased. These reviews cost $150 to $300 a book, such publishers say. &quot;For a mere $150, popular presses could save themselves from a lot of embarrassment,&quot; asserts Marian Neal Ash, executive editor of Yale University Press. &quot;It seems short-sighted of a publishing house not to cough up that small amount.&quot;    But the situation is different in general-interest publishing, industry executives maintain. For one thing, outside authorities on a given topic aren't always available. &quot;It's hard for an editor behind the desk to find the resources and to find the right people&quot; to review a manuscript, says Maria Guarnaschelli, a senior editor at William Morrow andamp; Co. Besides, she argues, truth &quot;should be something the authors concern themselves with.&quot;    Moreover, even when a qualified reader can be found, &quot;it's hard to get the money&quot; to pay for a review in most cases, says Ms. Guarnaschelli. She notes that when she edited &quot;American Couples,&quot; the authors negotiated a clause in their budget providing $1,000 to pay outside specialists to evaluate the book.    Publishers also argue that many how-to and pop-psychology books don't require the same documentation as serious medical, historical or biographical tomes. &quot;The publisher's responsibility has to be linked closely to the importance of the issue,&quot; says Michael Korda, editor in chief of Gulf andamp; Western Inc.'s Simon andamp; Schuster unit and the author of such books as &quot;Power: How to Get It, How To Use it.&quot;    Mr. Korda, who says he makes no &quot;vaunted research claims&quot; in his own books, notes that as an editor he doesn't subject pop-psychology books to &quot;microscopic scrutiny.&quot; He adds: &quot;A lot of these how-to books aren't exactly brain research into Parkinson's disease. If a book says you can apply yoga to the stock market or lose enough weight eating zucchini to get into a bikini, it's not going to hurt anyone.&quot;    Indeed, he and many others in the industry tend to count on an author's credentials rather than on a specialist's review. &quot;I have to rely on the credibility of the person I'm dealing with,&quot; says Owen Laster, head of the literary division at William Morris Agency.    Certainly, such trust has caused popular publishers their share of grief. In a highly publicized and embarrassing incident in 1984, Random House Inc. recalled from bookstores some 58,000 copies of its &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl: The Life and Legend of Barbara Hutton&quot; because of errors and the threat of a lawsuit from a Beverly Hills physician wrongly named as having overmedicated the heiress. (A revised version was later published by Secaucus, N.J.-based Lyle Stewart Inc.)    &quot;It's very difficult for me to think of anything we could have done that we did not do&quot; to establish the biography's accuracy, says Gerald Hollingsworth, Random House's chief counsel. &quot;The book was read carefully by outside counsel to identify any troublesome libel or copyright problems, and I spent lengthy sessions with the author, who produced various documents.&quot;    More recently, Doubleday andamp; Co. has been defending the authenticity of its 1986 best seller &quot;The Undergound Empire: Where Crime and Governments Embrace.&quot; James Mills, the author, claims in the book that he accompanied a special force of federal agents working to destroy major drug rings in the 1970s. Shortly after its publication, a Los Angeles Times article disclosed that 43 people mentioned in the book said some events described in it are untrue. Two figures mentioned in the book have filed libel suits. A Doubleday spokeswoman says, &quot;We stand behind the book and are defending it vigorously.&quot; Mr. Mill's lawyers say there is &quot;no question&quot; of its veracity.    Industry executives say it is almost inevitable that there will be challenges to controversial or historical books. For example, the current best seller &quot;Spycatcher,&quot; published by Viking Penguin Inc., was banned in Britain by authorities who disputed its allegations that British agents plotted to overthrow former Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the 1970s.    Marvin Brown, Viking Penguin's president, says his company decided that its author, Peter Wright, as a former assistant director of the British intelligence agency, &quot;is entirely credible.&quot; But, he acknowledges, &quot;it's virtually impossible for a publisher to check out something like (&quot;Spycatcher&quot;) or to verify historical facts when the facts have never been published.&quot;    However, several authors interviewed say that fact checking isn't a high priority even in books based on seemingly verifiable research. One of them, Lucy Rose Fischer, a University of Minnesota sociology professor and the author of &quot;Linked Lives: Adult Daughters and Their Mothers,&quot; studied 80 mothers and daughters for her book. But while Harper andamp; Row Publishers Inc. checked references to published material, she says, it didn't question her research or ask a sociologist to read the manuscript.    Mr. Blotnick's work wasn't closely reviewed, either. Facts on File Inc., which published two of his books, says it didn't feel the need to check up on him because of his good reputation and his status as a Forbes columnist. &quot;We don't receive things and look at them with suspicion; we look with optimism,&quot; says John Thornton, associate publisher at Facts on File. &quot;There are 50,000 new titles printed every year in the industry, and we would turn into an investigative arm if that attitude were changed.&quot;    Mr. Blotnick's works were never challenged until last month, when the New York Daily News disclosed that the self-described &quot;business psychologist&quot; received his Ph.D. from a correspondence school. It also questioned his claim that he made a continuous study of about 9,000 subjects over more than 25 years. Mr. Blotnick defends his study, which he says he did by tracking some 800 to 900 people, each of whom told him about several others.    At least one of Mr. Blotnick's publishers is being more cautious now. Viking Penguin says it is &quot;awaiting verification of research&quot; before bringing out his &quot;Ambitious Men&quot; in paperback.    In general, however, nonfiction publishers don't seem ready to hire fact checkers or start a review system. Publishers &quot;are very concerned about libel readings,&quot; says William Morrow's Ms. Guarnaschelli, &quot;and probably to some extent facts -- but probably not as much as is necessary.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
