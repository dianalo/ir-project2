Before last month, you could make an educated guess and that was it. While the government, from customs documents, could tell you the value of imports clearing the docks in San Francisco or New Orleans, no one was keeping track of the states where the goods were destined. Nor could you find a state-by-state breakdown showing where products bound for export were actually produced.    The Census Bureau, sensing a market for better foreign trade statistics, has filled this void. Using information culled from revised customs forms, the bureau has begun tabulating state trade activity by dollar value. The figures, updated monthly, can be found in the Census Bureau publication &quot;Highlights of U.S. Export and Import Trade.&quot;    Here, from the just-released list for January, are the 10 leading export states: California, Texas, Michigan, New York, Louisiana, Washington, Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois and Ohio. California's January exports were valued at $1.76 billion.    The top five import states: California, New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Texas.    Census has even more refined state trade figures in the wings. By early fall, the bureau hopes to be assembling monthly export data for hundreds of general product categories by state. An example: the value of furniture exports shipped from Michigan in May 1987.    In a second monthly survey, the export origin of more specific product groups, say &quot;metal office furniture,&quot; will be listed but only by multistate region. Publishing these figures by individual states could, in some cases, be an obvious sign of how much export business a specific company is doing. Census officials say this would effectively betray the bureau's pledge to keep information disclosed by individual businesses confidential. Census is charging a hefty fee for the state export product figures: $3,800 for a year's subscription to each report, $5,100 for both.    ---   CANCER RESEARCHERS IN FLORIDA get 9% of that state's tobacco tax. In Arkansas, 15% of the state insurance sales tax goes to pensions for firefighters.    Earmarking government revenue for specific purposes is widespread, but the practice varies from state to state. A study by the National Conference of State Legislatures found almost 90% of Alabama's tax revenue earmarked in advance for education, highways, tourism and local government. Connecticut, Delaware and Hawaii have just 5% of their taxes spoken for in advance.    ---   SET BULLET) DIVIDE THE BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES in a community by the black population and you get what demographer William O'Hare calls the &quot;black business rate.&quot; The figure could serve as a rough indicator of local business climates for black entrepreneurs. Fast-growing communities have the highest rates, indicating that minority-owned businesses do relatively better where local economies are surging.    Los Angeles has 25 black-owned businesses per 1,000 black citizens, tops in the nation. Next are San Francisco, Houston, Washington and San Diego. At the bottom of the list: Philadelphia; Chicago; Shreveport, La.; Newark, N.J.; Buffalo, N.Y.; and Mobile and Birmingham, Ala.    Mr. O'Hare reports his findings in the July issue of American Demographics magazine.    ---   WORKER DEFECTIONS in the electronics industry vary sharply among states. Employee turnover in 1986 ranged from 10% of the work force at Arizona electronics concerns to twice that rate at companies in the New York City area; Orange County, Calif., and Texas. The figures are from the American Electronics Association, Santa Clara, Calif.    The trade group also notes that the 2 1/2-year-old electronics industry slump isn't spread evenly across the U.S. States with major electronics employers, such as California, Illinois, Massachusetts and Minnesota, lost thousands of industry jobs, but Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington gained 2,000 jobs each in the year ended mid-1986.    ---   MAINE ZAPS IRRADIATED FOOD: Organic food growers and anti-nuclear activists helped push through a law making Maine the first state in the U.S. to ban the sale of food treated with radiation. Irradiation, a relatively new food industry technology, helps keep fresh food from spoiling and prolongs the shelf life of processed food. Spices are the only irradiated food items sold in Maine.    ---   ATLANTA'S STREET ATLAS lists 32 streets, roads and circles named &quot;Peachtree.&quot; A quaint tradition, to be sure, but confusing if you're a tourist, firefighter or ambulance driver. Communities with the luxury of naming streets from scratch ought to be more logical, says Carroll Underwood, executive director of the Southwest Georgia Planning and Development Commission, in Camilla, Ga. His booklet, &quot;Street Naming and Property Numbering for Small Cities,&quot; is $1 a copy. </TEXT></DOC>
