Planet 8, when the opera opens, is a green temperate paradise inhabited by a handsome, vibrant people. Smiling and sandaled, they gather fruits in woven baskets as they wait to evolve into an even wiser species of beings under the benevolent tutelage of their Canopean overlords. Then a galactic blip tilts the planet's axis and turns the peaceful haven into a large, freezing snowball.    Not even a penguin is left to ponder the meaning of it all, though the audience here on planet Earth at the Houston grand opera certainly was exhorted to do so. Many times, just in case someone deaf and dumb did not understand the allegorical references to our own woebegone world. I was surprised we were not asked to leave donations to the Sierra Club on our way out.    This is not to say &quot;Planet 8&quot; is a wasted evening, especially not when compared with Mr. Glass's 1982 operatic portrait of the Pharaoh Akhnaten as a fey, frolicking fool. But it should have been better. Certainly the elements were promising. The cascading scales and shimmering textures constituting Mr. Glass's limited musical language would seem ideal to describe falling snowflakes and expanding ice. And Ms. Lessing's story is to my mind the most appealing of the five-part &quot;Canopus in Argos&quot; outer-space fables that earned her the eye-rolling disdain of most admirers of her early, proto-feminist novel &quot;The Golden Notebook.&quot;    She wrote &quot;Planet 8&quot; in 1982, well before the greenhouse effect became a Major Conversation Topic. Just as Planet 8 freezes, we may someday fry, underneath a suffocating quilt of noxious gases. We are told this every day now, so the opera certainly has topicality going for it. Credit Ms. Lessing and Mr. Glass with reminding us that important issues can be illuminated on the opera stage. But for us to care about a planet's demise we first have to become interested in the people on it.    This doesn't happen in &quot;Planet 8.&quot; Ms. Lessing wrote six versions of the libretto and a seventh may be needed. When the young man Nonni slips from an icy peak, it is hard to share the young woman Alsi's grief, despite Louise Edeiken's extravagant acting. Up till then, I had hardly noticed Nonni as an individual in the fur-covered, freezing multitude.    As happens so often with authors who adapt their own work, Ms. Lessing seems to like her words a bit too much to cut very many of them. Even Timothy Breese and Harlan Foss, both fine singer-actors, can't sustain the initially interesting but finally numbingly gabby encounter between Johor, the emissary from Canopus, and Doeg, Planet 8's memory maker and record keeper. Indeed, most scenes would benefit from some trimming, though Mr. Foss as Doeg does get to flaunt his own amazing mnemonic gifts in an incredibly long-winded monologue about the rebirth of Planet 8's deathless molecules somewhere else in the universe. And I do mean monologue, not aria.    Mr. Glass is so obsessed with delivering the message, he frequently forgets the medium. Whenever characters are asked to deliver a Significant Thought (not infrequently on the level of &quot;there are many ways to die&quot; or &quot;the world turns&quot;), the singing stops and declamation starts. How you wished for a few subtitles above their heads and a little song on their lips.    Is this opera finished? Sometimes you think maybe the composer just didn't get around to writing arias because their melodic demands frighten him and he is busy anyhow composing most of the new operas in the world. (&quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; received its premiere late this spring in Cambridge, Mass.; &quot;1000 Airplanes on the Roof&quot; is opening now in Vienna.)    Such shortcomings are not only disappointing but puzzling given the generally inspired level of so much of &quot;Planet 8's&quot; music. Under John DeMain's baton, the prelude moved swiftly to establish an atmosphere of impending doom. The arpeggio exercises Mr. Glass used to turn out by the mile are trimmed back and subdued to give the opera a melancholy undercurrent. A newly enriched orchestral palette includes lovely melodic flourishes for bassoon, clarinet and violin. In an affecting scene showing shivering folks hauling boats filled with life-giving magic flowers through a swirling snowstorm, muted trumpets and drums send up their emanations from the pit.    Designers Eiko Ishioka and Minoru Terada Domberger (he also directed) depict this galactic outpost with spare, elegant settings and a minimum of hackneyed sci-fi gadgetry. Johor makes a dreamy entrance, dropping gently to the stage inside a glistening white robot. Disturbing film images of frightened, galloping beasts and hurtling boulders convey a feeling of helplessness and disaster.    So &quot;Planet 8,&quot; even a flawed &quot;Planet 8,&quot; is worth seeing tonight or tomorrow. It then travels to London's English National Opera, Amsterdam's Het Muziektheater, and West Germany's Kiel opera. All three companies joined the Houston Grand Opera in commissioning this work. One hopes that the current economic slump hereabouts will not undercut the adventurous spirit that helped this company take part in a worthy international enterprise. And as &quot;Planet 8&quot; spins through Europe, perhaps the composer will respond to the good faith of his bi-hemispheric sponsors by finding the time to improve what he made for them. Unlike Planet 8 itself, this opera could easily evolve into a more perfect state. </TEXT></DOC>
