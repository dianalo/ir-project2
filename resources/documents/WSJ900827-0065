Now, James D. Donahue has taken the technology onestep further.   At a bizarre meeting held Thursday for more than 500investors of Hedged Securities Associates Inc., Mr. Donahue,the Englewood, Colo., firm's founder, confessed to losingmore than $100 million of their money through risky stockoptions trading, primarily involving shares of UAL Corp. But,fearful for his personal safety, Mr. Donahue didn't deliverhis confession in person -- he did it on video.</LP><TEXT>   As a result of Mr. Donahue's trading losses, the companyplans to file this week for protection from creditors underthe federal Bankruptcy Code, according to Robert A. Dill, anattorney for the investment firm.   Despite Mr. Donahue's absence, Mr. Dill said the firmhired security guards to keep order during the investors'meeting. &quot;There obviously were a number of very, very unhappypeople, and in a crowd that size, anything can happen,&quot; hesaid, adding that Mr. Donahue has received several threats inrecent days.   The still-unraveling scandal surrounding the secretivefirm has triggered four lawsuits in state courts in Coloradoand California and attracted the attention of ColoradoSecurities Commissioner Philip Feigin. However, citing agencypolicy, Mr. Feigin declined to comment on whether a formalinvestigation is under way. &quot;We're obviously aware of it,&quot;Mr. Feigin said in an interview.   Launched as a limited partnership 11 years ago, HedgedSecurities was unregistered with either the Securities andExchange Commission or state regulatory agencies. Still, itspromises of a 15% or better return on investments provedirresistible to pension funds representing employees ofWeyerhaeuser Co., the big lumber company based in Tacoma,Wash.; Houston-based Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc.; andother corporations.   Meanwhile, dozens of wealthy Colorado doctors, lawyers andbusiness executives also made the $100,000 minimum requiredinvestment despite warnings from professional money managers.The managers' informal inquiries about Hedged Securities werefrustrated by Mr. Donahue's refusal to discuss details of thefirm's holdings or transactions. &quot;It became the cliquishthing to do,&quot; said Joe Tanis, a vice president withDenver-based Boettcher andamp; Co. &quot;A lot of people got burned.&quot;   According to a prospectus given to potential investors,the 62-year-old Mr. Donahue has a masters degree inmathematics from Stanford University, worked in the researchdepartment of Martin Marietta Corp. in the 1960s and wasemployed by Science Applications Inc., a Denver computerresearch firm, before launching Hedged Securities in 1979.Operating with a small staff from the firm's modest office inthe Denver suburb, Mr. Donahue was known as an aggressivetrader in the often volatile arena of &quot;put&quot; and &quot;call&quot; stockoptions.   A call option entitles the holder to buy shares of anunderlying stock at a certain price within a specified periodand would be bought by someone betting on an increase in thestock's price. A put gives the holder similar rights to sellsuch shares and would be purchased by an investor looking fora downturn in the stock's price.   In a confidential 1985 memo to investors, Mr. Donahue saidHedged Securities would seek to hedge its investments bypurchasing offsetting put and call positions in a widevariety of stocks. But after years of apparently successfulresults, investors became suspicious in recent weeks afterHedged Securities began suffering substantial losses,according to persons familiar with the situation.   In a suit filed last week in a state district court inEnglewood, Paradigm Partners Inc. of Chicago said a pensioninvestment fund it controls lost more than $15 millionthrough its Hedged Securities investments. Paradigm allegedthat when the fund trustees tried to investigate earlier thismonth, Mr. Donahue denied them access to his firm's books andrepeatedly canceled meetings.   Thursday's session was scheduled after the Weyerhaeuserpension fund, which lost an estimated $30 million throughHedged Securities, and other investors began demanding anaccounting, according to persons involved in the case.   In the videotape played for creditors, Mr. Donahue saidthat since late 1989, he had sold off other investments tospend increasing amounts of money in call positions in thestock of UAL, parent company of United Airlines and thetarget of a buy-out bid by employee unions. Hedged Securitiessuffered huge losses after the buy-out bid floundered forlack of financing and after the price of UAL stock fellsteeply on Iraq's recent invasion of Kuwait, Mr. Donahue toldinvestors.   &quot;The loss is extensive and involves almost all of thetotal assets of the fund,&quot; he said, according to a transcriptof the videotape. &quot;My words at this point cannot possiblyalleviate the emotion{sic} or financial impact on each personinvolved nor can they express the deep sorrow I have overthis incident.&quot;   Hedged Securities has about $2 million in assets remainingand hasn't decided whether to file for a Chapter 11reorganization or a Chapter 7 liquidation, according to Mr.Dill. Since Thursday's meeting, Mr. Donahue has begun turningdetailed financial information over to investors, Mr. Dilladded.</TEXT></DOC>
