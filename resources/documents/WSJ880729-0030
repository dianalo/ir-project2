Sources on Capitol Hill said the UMW believes that tougher laws regulating sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired electric utilities are inevitable. Thus, the union wants to help shape the most temperate bill it can. Pollutants from power-plant smokestacks are believed by many scientists to be the leading cause of acid rain.    The UMW, to this point steadfast in opposing all acid-rain measures, declined comment.    Should the union go through with its change in policy, that could spur a congressional overhaul of the Clean Air Act this session -- and is likely to put the union at odds with several traditional allies on the issue, including the utilities industry and the National Coal Association, a Washington trade group.    The acid-rain debate is perennially one of the capital's most contentious and has been the primary hurdle in congressional efforts to amend the Clean Air Act, written in 1970 and last overhauled in 1977. The debate pits two mighty lobbies -- the environmentalists and the utilities -- against each other. Both have advanced a surfeit of scientific data to argue either that sulfur dioxide is causing damage to forests and streams or that it isn't.    This year has been no exception, and revision of the Clean Air Act seemed doomed until two weeks ago. It was then that George Mitchell, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Environmental Protection and a leading advocate of tougher pollution-control laws, announced he was willing to compromise.    Instead of asking for 12 million tons of sulfur dioxide reductions over 10 years, as he had done in an earlier bill, the Maine Democrat said he would be satisfied with a 10-million-ton reduction over 12 years. Twenty-six other senators backed the new proposal, which pledges to share the costs of controlling acid rain among all the states.    In the House, meanwhile, a similar bill was introduced, based on a pact recently struck between Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste. Other acid-rain bills are pending there; they are generally opposed by, among others, the influential Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, John Dingell (D., Mich.).    Any proposal from the mine workers is likely to impress Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, who has been perhaps the single most powerful opponent of acid-rain legislation. In his home state of West Virginia, which produces about 15% of the nation's coal, the UMW remains an esteemed constituency.    Several sources said that Sen. Byrd and Richard Trumka, the UMW president, have discussed the union's contemplated strategy reversal. But a spokeswoman for the senator said she was unaware of any meetings.    The specifics of a UMW plan are unknown and are probably still being formulated. A trade publication, Inside EPA, reported some details last week, but those aren't accurate, sources said. </TEXT></DOC>
