Ueberroth that apparently resultedin changes to Ueberroth's agreement to buy the airline from parentTexas Air Corp., sources said.   After four days of almost continuous bargaining, Ueberroth'sgroup and the three striking unions, representing the Machinists,pilots and flight attendants, struck their deals at about 6 a.m.Monday in Washington.   The parties then flew to New York and went directly to U.S.Bankruptcy Court for a series of meetings that lasted eight hours.Present for some of the meetings was former Defense Secretary FrankCarlucci, although his role was not clear.   At 7 p.m., Ueberroth emerged from the courthouse and announcedthe union settlement, calling it ``a historic labor partnership.''   Sources said Ueberroth and the unions apparently made changes tothe $464 million deal under which the former baseball commissionerwould buy Eastern. Unless Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo agreesto the changes, the unions' agreements with Ueberroth cannot goforward.   A key change demanded by the unions is that the bankruptcy courtappoint a special trustee to take over the operation of Easternfrom Lorenzo as the airline attempts to emerge from Chapter 11, theNew York Times reported in Tuesday's editions.   ``We have not yet seen a copy of the agreement. We understand itis very complex and we will study it,'' Texas Air spokesman ArtKent said late Monday from Houston.   ``We have one more major bridge to cross,'' Ueberroth toldreporters, reading a statement he had just scrawled in thecourthouse lobby. ``And that's right here in this courthouse. Thatbridge must be crossed. ... There's no guarantee we will cross it.''   Ueberroth said talks would continue Tuesday in an effort to getEastern, the nation's seventh-largest airline, back in the air.Eastern has been largely grounded since Machinists struck March 4and pilots and flight attendants walked out in support.   Texas Air, which purchased Eastern in 1986, was maintaining thatnothing had been accomplished.   ``There's no agreement as far as we're concerned,'' said BruceZirinsky, an Eastern lawyer.   ``There was no meeting of the minds,'' said Harvey Miller,another Eastern lawyer.   Ueberroth declined to give details of his deals with the unions.Union sources said the concessions totalled about $210 million.   The unions have been wary that proposed tranfers of assetstotalling $79 million from Eastern to Texas Air could affectEastern's viability. The unions, since before the strike, have beenoppoosed to transferring aircraft, routes, airport gates, amongother thing.   All agreements must be approved by parties to Eastern'sbankruptcy proceeding, which include Texas Air and Eastern'screditors. Eastern filed for protection under the bankruptcy lawson March 9.   Lawyers for the creditors were present for the whirlwind seriesof meetings at the courthouse. Among the union participants wereCharles Bryan, head of Eastern's Machinists union; Jack Bavis, headof Eastern's pilots union; and Mary Jane Barry, head of Eastern'sflight attendants union.   Judge Burton R. Lifland, who is presiding over the bankruptcy,was nearby and even made popcorn for the negotiators. Carlucci, avice chairman of a Washington investment company, was in and out ofthe talks. He declined to identify his role.   By the end of the day, the negotiators had reached the point ofexhaustion. Ueberroth, who flew to California on Friday, returnedto Washington on Saturday and said he had not slept since.Representatives of the unions and examiner David Shapiro had beengoing non-stop with Ueberroth's people since Thursday night.   Several times, they needed to break away. Ueberroth tookrepresentatives of the three striking unions to lunch. At anotherpoint, Ueberroth broke away with partner J. Thomas Talbot and andwent to a restaurant where they talked and watched a collegebaseball game on television.   By dusk, the parties said they were too tired to go on andUeberroth asked the court's permission to announce the deals withthe three unions. He said the agreements also would cover 11,000non-union employees at Eastern, such as reservation clerks, ticketagents, and clerical workers.   A representative of non-union employees, Mary Grace Shore, saidher group objected to not being represented in the talks. Ms. Shoresits on the Eastern unsecured creditors committee.   Ueberroth has said Eastern could begin expanding its schedule 24hours after final agreements are reahced between his group, TexasAir and the unions.   Karen Ceremsak, an Eastern spokeswoman in Miami, said Monday itcould take 10 days for the airline to resume 80 percent of itsprestrike schedule of 1,040 daily flights once the unions agreed toreturn.   The delay would stem from needed maintenance and inspection ofidled planes, ferrying of aircraft to appropriate airports,recalling laid-off employees and other logistical tasks.   Using non-union employees and non-striking 200 pilots, Easternis flying about 110 flights daily, focusing on its Northeastshuttle and Latin American routes. The airline has a deal to sellthe shuttle to New York developer Donald J. Trump for $365 million.   Raymond Wright, a vice chairman of the master executive councilof the Air Line Pilots Association, estimated it could take 45-60days for Eastern to resume a full schedule once striking employeesreturn.   Union officials also said it would be foolish and costly torestore a full schedule immediately because Eastern, alreadycarrying a heavy debt, would have few passengers in the daysimmediately following resumption of service.   Separately, a federal appeals court upheld injunctions barringNew York metropolitan-area passenger rail workers from striking insympathy with Eastern employees.   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower courtruling that the federal Railway Labor Act barred unionized workersat the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Commuter Railroad, NewJersey Transit and Amtrak from honoring the picket lines ofstriking Eastern machinists.   Sympathy strikes at the railroads would have affected about400,000 commuters.</TEXT></DOC>
