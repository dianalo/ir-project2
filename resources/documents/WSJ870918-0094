FreedmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BRK TDY TRITENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)PULP, PAPER, PACKAGING (ALL TYPES) (PUL) </IN><TEXT>   Owens-Illinois Inc. said it is seeking to acquire Brockway Inc. for $60 a share, or about $750 million, in a move that would re-establish it as the leading glass-container maker in the U.S.    The companies said they expect to reach a merger agreement. A Brockway spokesman said late yesterday that the company probably wouldn't announce the results of the board meeting yesterday on the proposal until this morning. &quot;My gut feeling is that this is something that isn't going to be rushed through,&quot; he said. He declined to say whether Brockway considers the proposal friendly.    Securities analysts said the Owens-Illinois bid surprised them, but they generally endorsed it. &quot;Brockway has a reputation as an excellent glass company with a strong balance sheet, and Owens-Illinois is the low-cost producer,&quot; said Cornelius Thornton, analyst at First Boston Corp. &quot;It makes a lot of sense.&quot;    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Brockway shares jumped 49%, rising $19.125 to close at $58.375.    Los Angeles-based Teledyne Inc., a diversified manufacturing and insurance concern, holds about 21% of Brockway's shares outstanding. Teledyne's Brockway stake, held through various insurance subsidiaries, had been 26% before the spinoff of Teledyne's former Argonaut Group Inc. subsidiary to Teledyne holders last year. A Teledyne spokesman declined to comment on the bid for Brockway, but noted that &quot;historically Teledyne has gone along with management&quot; of companies in which it holds a stake.    On the Big Board yesterday, Teledyne shares rose $11.75 to close at $369.50.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Argonaut shares closed at $45.25, up $2.125.    Owens-Illinois, a Toledo, Ohio, unit of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. of New York, was taken private last February in a leveraged buyout valued at $3.64 billion. In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company, largely with borrowed money; the debt ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sales of its assets.    Analysts estimated that the purchase of Brockway, a Jacksonville, Fla., glass and plastic container concern, would increase Owens-Illinois's share of the glass-container market to 40% from 24%. &quot;Owens-Illinois wants to remain a dominant factor in the industry,&quot; said Jennifer Williams, analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., Baltimore. &quot;This would put them firmly back in front,&quot; Ms. Williams added.    Glass-industry executives said they doubted the acquisition would face antitrust problems because, even with 40% of the glass-container market, the combined companies would have only about a 25% share of the total packaging market.    But some analysts questioned whether Owens-Illinois's cash flow will be adequate to sustain the debt service resulting from the purchase. &quot;This is a very fully priced deal at a time when Owens-Illinois is loaded with debt,&quot; said Edward Schollmeyer, analyst at PaineWebber Inc.    As of June 30, Owens-Illinois's debt represented a hefty 96.3% of total capitalization, following the leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis.    Terms of the proposed transaction call for Owens-Illinois to begin a tender offer for Brockway's about 12.5 million shares outstanding &quot;promptly after approval of the merger agreement.&quot; The proposed agreement requires that Owens-Illinois obtain financing and that more than two-thirds of Brockway's common stock be tendered. Any shares not tendered would be acquired for $60 a share in a subsequent merger.    To protect against a competing takeover offer, the proposed agreement calls for Brockway to pay at least $37.5 million to Owens-Illinois if another company acquires it. In addition, Brockway would grant Owens-Illinois the option to buy 2.3 million treasury shares at $60 apiece. The surge in the price of Brockway shares, however, indicates investors don't expect a higher bid to emerge, analysts said.    Analysts speculated that Brockway had approached Owens-Illinois because it feared a hostile takeover bid. Among the company's suitors were several foreign concerns and New York-based Triangle Industries Inc., which previously had acquired National Can and American Can, the analysts said.    Owens-Illinois's move comes in the wake of enormous consolidation in the glass-container industry. In the past five years, the industry has slashed its capacity by about 25% in a series of mergers and leveraged buyouts. Most recently, Anchor Glass Container Corp., Tampa, Fla., acquired Diamond-Bathurst Inc. for $191 million, bringing Anchor neck-and-neck with Owens-Illinois, the longstanding industry leader. Brockway had previously been the No. 2 producer.    Owens-Illinois had been diversifying in recent years but, faced with a threat to its major line, it became determined to expand in glass containers, sources said.    An Owens-Illinois spokesman cited opportunities &quot;to really improve Brockway's competitive position,&quot; particularly in glass bottles for beer and soft drinks.    &quot;Owens-Illinois should have administrative savings and will be able to shut a couple of plants and move the business around to utilize the remaining facilities in a better manner,&quot; said an executive at a competing glass maker.    Principals at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts declined to comment on the transaction. </TEXT></DOC>
