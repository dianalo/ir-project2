White, did not barjudges from ordering tax increases, however.   White said the judge could have ordered, in a less specific way,Kansas City school officials ``to levy property taxes at a rateadequate to fund the desegregation remedy, and could have enjoinedthe operation of state laws that would have prevented (the schooldistrict) from exercising this power,'' White said.   The court's vote on that point was 5-4. Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor andAntonin Scalia dissented, decrying the court's ``casual embrace oftaxation imposed by the unelected, life-tenured federal judiciary.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
