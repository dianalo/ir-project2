The national Centers for Disease Control reported thathospitalization rates for breast cancer, lung cancer, colon andrectal cancer, and cervical cancer all have declined during thedecade. The rates are calculated by looking at records of hospitaldischarges.   Hospitalization rates do not necessarily reflect trends in thenumbers of people with various cancers, said Dr. James Mendlein, aCDC researcher. Some cancers may require more follow-up hospitalstays than others, and the effort to cut the cost of health carealso can influence the number of times a patient is hospitalized,he noted.   ``This gives you just one measure of the health care impact (ofvarious cancers),'' Mendlein said.   The drop in hospitalization rates parallels the drop in the rateof occurrence of cervical cancer, colorectal cancer and male lungcancer, Mendlein said. On the other hand, while hospitalizationsfor breast cancer and female lung cancer are declining somewhat,the incidence of those two diseases continues to increase, he said.   For 1986, the latest year for which figures are available, theCDC estimates hospital discharge rates as:   _Breast cancer, 172 per 100,000 people, down from a peak of 199in 1983.   _Lung cancer, male, 142 per 100,000, down from a peak of 182 in1984.   _Lung cancer, female, 83 per 100,000, down from a peak of 100 in1983.   _Colorectal cancer, 86 per 100,000, down from a peak of 92 in1981.   _Cervical cancer, 46 per 100,000, down from a peak of 89 in 1976.   A National Cancer Institute report earlier this year put breastcancer at its highest rate in history, and it is still the leadingcause of cancer death among women. Lung cancer, the leading causeof cancer deaths overall, is increasing among women and decreasingamong men.   When studying hospital discharge rates, ``incidence oroccurrence is just one of the forces,'' Mendlein said. ``There areother, economic forces as well.''   He noted that such factors as shifts in Medicare policy andtrends in outpatient treatment could change the rates of hospitalvisits for various diseases.</TEXT></DOC>
