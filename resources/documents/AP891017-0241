L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., said the March 12, 1986 audit by the San Francisco branch ofthe Federal Home Loan Bank Board found that Lincoln had violatedrules limiting risky direct investments in commercial ventures, wasnot in compliance with accounting standards, had substantial loanlosses, had inadequate and missing records and was speculating inoptions trading.   The FDIC, which insures bank and Sandamp;L deposits, took control ofLincoln, of Irvine, Calif., last April after Sandamp;L regulators at thebank board declared it insolvent.   Seidman, in sworn testimony to the House Banking Committee,estimated that the failure of Lincoln would eventually costtaxpayers between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, making it thecostliest Sandamp;L collapse in the nation's history.   Had the FDIC been in charge of supervising Lincoln in 1986, itwould have moved to stop the abuses, Seidman said. ``My staffindicated that had we made such findings in one of our owninstitutions, we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desistorder to stop the hazardous operations,'' he said.   The FDIC, under orders from President Bush, began taking overinsolvent Sandamp;Ls in February, removing them from the jurisdiction ofthe now-defunct bank board, headed by M. Danny Wall.   Since the Lincoln takeover, the government has filed a $1.1billion fraud and racketeering suit against Phoenix millionaireCharles H. Keating Jr., chairman of Lincoln's parent, AmericanContinental Corp. It charges that Keating, his family andassociates diverted funds from Lincoln's depositors for theirpersonal use.   A key question of the hearings is why the bank board under Wall,after meeting with Keating, transferred the task of regulatingLincoln to Washington from the agency's San Francisco office.   The San Francisco-based regulators recommended in the spring of1987 that Lincoln be seized. However, after Keating complained thathe was being treated unfairly, Wall ordered another examination byregulators in Washington, delaying action against Lincoln untilthis year.   ``The sad fact about this failure is that the warning signs werethere and the stop signs posted in time to prevent much of the lossto the insurance fund,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,Banking Committee chairman.   ``But the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, instead, waved theinstitution through the stop signals and let it continue racingdown the fast land until it crashed.''   ``Institutions like Lincoln Savings and Loan should never beallowed to poison our financial system,'' said Rep. Chalmers Wylieof Ohio, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee. ``Lincolnwas a rogue elephant. ... The fact that this institution wasfederally insured is frightening.''   Because of congressional protocol, the House committee isunlikely to deeply explore the role of five senators who receivedcampaign contributions from Keating. Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.;Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn,D-Ohio, and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., met with regulators inApril 1987 to question them about Lincoln.   DeConcini and Riegle have since returned the contributions, butthe self-styled citizens lobby Common Cause last week asked theSenate Ethics Committee to investigate the matter.   Last week, the banking panel voted to subpoena federal andCalifornia regulators, private accountants and Keating himself.Additional hearings are scheduled Oct. 24, Oct. 31 and Nov. 7.Keating and Wall are not scheduled to appear until the last session.   During the debate of the Sandamp;L bill, Gonzalez had soughtunsuccessfully to force Wall to be reconfirmed by the Senate in hisnew position as director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, anarm of the Treasury Department created to replace the bank board.   However, as part of the compromise to get the legislationenacted, Gonzalez dropped his objection to Wall, who was stronglysupported by Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior Republican on theSenate Banking Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
