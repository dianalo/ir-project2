Now some money managers are watching hungrily as companies focus on their burgeoning health-care liabilities. The managers hope funds set aside to cover these costs will become the next big pot of money to be invested in stocks and bonds.    Accountants are already preparing for the day corporate balance sheets will have to include expected costs of health care promised to retirees, both current and future. And companies, having enjoyed the tax-exempt status of pension funds, are groping for an equally attractive vehicle to fund those promises.    Enter the life insurance industry.    Some insurers are offering policies that help companies use the tax breaks of life insurance -- neither the investment returns nor the death benefit is taxed -- to cover this enormous looming health-care liability.    A few insurance executives have qualms about whether this squares with the original intent of the special tax breaks for insurance. And some corporate pension-fund executives say this is just the latest tax dodge.    Some money managers embrace the concept. &quot;Corporate-owned life insurance has emerged as the vehicle to accomplish corporate health-care funding goals,&quot; says Douglas Love, vice president in research at BEA Associates, New York. He says studies have estimated that health-care liabilities may amount to 50% to 100% of pension liabilities in size.    Dennis McKoy, a marketing executive at Johnson andamp; Higgins, a New York insurance broker, says that such plans &quot;are becoming more widely accepted and can be a very effective way to recover costs&quot; of both health care and of retirement pay for employees above the $94,000 limit for payouts from tax-exempt pension funds.    However, Mr. McKoy says that companies using such insurance have to face the issue of how far they want to go. &quot;Can they justify writing a life insurance policy on their employees where the proceeds are due to the company?&quot;    For example, the Johnson andamp; Higgins executive asks, &quot;Why not write company-owned life insurance to fund a capital equipment expenditure? Some utilities have considered using this as a means of recovering costs in the event of the decommissioning of a nuclear facility.&quot;    There are limits. In 1986, Congress imposed a cap of $50,000 per employee on the amount that companies could borrow against the life policies. This year, a proposal was defeated that would have curbed retroactively how companies used funds from life insurance policies.    Richard Magner, vice president for corporate products at Cigna Corp. in Philadelphia, says the threat of such tax-law changes has drastically inhibited the sales of company-owned life insurance for health-care purposes.    Mr. Magner says only 15 companies have purchased broad-based insurance contracts on employees to cover health-care costs in the past two years. &quot;A lot of companies have looked at it. But their concern is that the ever-changing rules of the game will make whatever they do today less attractive.&quot;    The Cigna executive says that giving companies the life insurance tax breaks makes good sense in terms of public policy by enabling companies to avoid reneging on their health-care promises. &quot;Now the trend is for companies to think about how they can get out from under them.&quot;    Some analysts believe that, although life insurance escaped any major hits in the latest round of tax-law wrangling, it someday will come in for the kind of cutbacks that real-estate tax shelters suffered in the revisions of 1986.    &quot;This is an industry that is under a lot of scrutiny,&quot; says Joan Zief, who tracks insurance companies at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith. &quot;I would say we've only begun to see Congress look at the tax advantages of this industry, particularly if we get into a revenue-raising mode.&quot;    Mr. McKoy of Johnson andamp; Higgins says House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an avowed opponent of insurance tax breaks, &quot;would love to get his hands on this and tear it apart.&quot;    One company that is considering such a policy despite the tax-law flux and other questions is Southwestern Bell, the St. Louis-based Baby Bell. Michael Wagner, an assistant controller, says his company has a binder agreement with an insurer.    &quot;The tax advantages are hard to ignore, and I'm sure that's why the insurance companies have worked as hard as they have to develop these products,&quot; Mr. Wagner says. And he adds that it's &quot;hard to ignore the kinds of returns&quot; made possible by borrowing against the policies' cash buildup.    But one pension-fund manager for a major consumer-products company says he can't believe that a problem as serious as health-care liabilities is going to be &quot;financed through these kinds of tax-evasion schemes.&quot;    Nevertheless, this executive says he has to spend a lot of time contending with such proposals, which he says often come to him via more senior executives who get the sales pitches on the golf course. &quot;It's really hard to shoot it down,&quot; he says. &quot;The way they describe it, company-owned life insurance will do everything but wash your car windows.&quot;    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Johnson andamp; Higgins&quot; -- WSJ July 18, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
