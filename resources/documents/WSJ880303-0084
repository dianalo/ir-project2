The Transportation Department report showed that 69.2% of all flights in January arrived within 15 minutes of scheduled times. That was up from 66.4% in December -- a poor performance that prompted the department to expand its investigation into airline scheduling practices.    The latest report once again scrambled the carriers' rankings: Pan American World Airways, a unit of Pan Am Corp., fell to seventh place in January from the top spot in December. USAir Group Inc.'s Pacific Southwest Airlines rose to third place in January from the 14th -- and last -- in December. Southwest placed third in December.    In January, 61.5% of Eastern's flights were on time, a drop from 69.5% in December. In Miami, a spokesman for the unit of Texas Air Corp. said the carrier's poor performance resulted from 16 days of severe weather in the Northeast, where its flights are concentrated, and six days of bad weather at its major hub in Atlanta.    Southwest's on-time performance rose to 85% from 74.2% the month before.    American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., slipped to fifth place in January from fourth in December. But the change may be particularly disappointing to the airline because it had the best record for the first three months the carriers were required to report their on-time performance, beginning last September.    An American spokesman blamed its performance on &quot;terribly adverse weather&quot; in January at its two major hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago.    Foul weather was also blamed by a spokesman for Pan Am, the first-place finisher in December. Weather particularly affected flights in the Northeast and Europe, where most of Pan Am's routes are located, he said. He added that Pan Am nonetheless turned in one of the best performances among major carriers. He predicted the next report will show a rebound for the airline in February.    The on-time performance tally includes all delays of 15 minutes or more, except for those caused by aircraft technical problems.    In a section designed to measure baggage service, the report showed that Southwest had the lowest rate of complaints for mishandled baggage. Southwest received 4.65 complaints per 1,000 passengers. Piedmont Aviation Inc.'s Piedmont Airlines had the highest rate, 18.12.    The department also reported that Florida Express Inc. had the highest rate of passengers denied boarding -- &quot;bumped&quot; -- for the last three months of 1987, followed by Pan Am, Aloha Inc.'s Aloha Airlines and USAir.    Meanwhile, consumers filed 2,051 complaints against U.S. airlines with the department in February, down from 3,396 in January but up from 1,417 a year earlier. Continental Airlines posted the highest complaint rate, 14.79 per 100,000 passengers, followed by Eastern. Continental also is a Texas Air unit. Southwest had the lowest complaint rate, 0.77.    ---                   Ranking the Airlines   Overall percentage of reported flights arriving on time in January*    RANK    JAN.
