Large</HL><DD> 12/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Next year's election contests for the White House and Congress once again will pit politicians against a tough but silent adversary: massive indifference.    The refusal of nearly half the nation's eligible voters to go to the polls exerts a major influence on the way politicians run for office. A ho-hum citizenry prompts candidates to emphasize bland, ephemeral claims of &quot;vision&quot; and &quot;leadership,&quot; rather than specific issues. Such issue-less campaigning, in turn, makes it hard for the winners to claim sweeping popular mandates when they report for work.    A prolonged economic slump could spark new interest in politics. Voter turnout rose markedly in the 1930s as the government grappled with the Great Depression and women grew more accustomed to the franchise. But some events that stir great political strife may not greatly affect voter participation. During the tumultuous Vietnam War years, for instance, turnout rates declined.    Americans have never been big-turnout voters, as shown by some startling statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. In every presidential election in the nation's history, the winning candidate has come in second behind the number of people who didn't vote. That's true even for the famous landslides.    In 1984, Ronald Reagan got the votes of 31% of the eligible-age population, trailing the 47% who didn't vote. In Lyndon Johnson's big 1964 victory, he came within a fraction of the non-voters but still lost, 38.1% to 37.8%. Franklin Roosevelt's 1936 share of the voting-age population was just under 35%, a distant second to the 43% who didn't show.    &quot;Most of the legal barriers which limited registration and voting in earlier years have been removed, so the primary reason people do not register and vote is because they are not interested,&quot; concludes Charles E. Johnson Jr., the Census Bureau analyst who traced this pattern of presidential voting all the way back to 1828 in his book, &quot;Nonvoting Americans.&quot;    Nearly 63% of the eligible-age population turned out to vote in the 1960 Kennedy-Nixon presidential contest, probably stirred on both sides by the presence of a Catholic candidate. From that historic peak, voter participation sank in each succeeding presidential election to just under 53% in 1980, despite the enfranchisement of many Southern blacks and a relaxation of registration rules nearly everywhere.    In 1984 the presidential turnout moved fractionally above 53%, and some voting analysts predicted that demographic trends alone would keep pushing it higher in future years. During the 20-year sag in turnout, the potential electorate had been swollen by baby-boomers reaching voting age, including a new slice of older teenagers enfranchised by the Constitution's 26th Amendment in 1971. Elections tend to be wasted on the rootless young, preoccupied with the personal business of starting their lives. But as these baby-boomers accumulate years, homes and taxes, their voting rates could be expected to rise.    But predictions of an aging electorate's turnout turnaround got a hard knock in last year's mid-term congressional elections. Less than 34% of the eligible-age population bothered to cast votes for candidates for Congress, in the form of counting used by the Census Bureau's annual Statistical Abstract. That was down sharply from the 38% turnout in 1982's Congress-only voting and the lowest since World War II.    The Census Bureau also conducts household sample surveys on voting after every federal election, and it turned up some interesting demographic cross-currents last year:    --The voting drop from 1982 cut across all age groups, except for those age 65 and older. Turnout in this age bracket rose to the highest level for a Congress-only election since the first of these surveys in 1966.    --Women overall voted at the same rate as men, but turnout of women age 18 to 44 last year exceeded that of men in the same age bracket.    --Whites and Hispanics voted at a lower rate than in 1982, but turnout among blacks rose for the third consecutive Congress-only election, further narrowing the gap with whites. (According to the Census Bureau survey, white turnout last year was 47%, compared with just over 43% for blacks; both figures are inflated by people who said they voted but didn't.) Among blacks in the 18-to-34 age bracket, including those in the South, turnout last year actually moved ahead of the rate for young whites.    --As in previous elections, education seemed the most important factor in who voted and who didn't: College graduates turned out at a higher rate than those who only graduated from high school, who in turn topped high school dropouts. Still, more than a third of the college graduates admitted in the survey that they didn't vote last year; in families with incomes topping $75,000, confessed nonvoters totaled 40%.    In recent years, for the first time in American history, the nation's legal electorate matches the adult population. Everyone who wants to can vote. In the two centuries since the Constitution was adopted, the nation has seen the end of most property-owning requirements, the enfranchisement of former slaves in the 19th century, and then a rush of 20th century reforms: voting rights given to women and 18-year-olds, suspension of literacy tests, relaxed residency rules and easier ways to register.    There's no detectable political support for going the whole way and making voting mandatory, which produces above-90% turnouts in Australia. But reformers hope for more gains by making registration still more convenient. In Minnesota, for example, citizens are allowed to register when they vote. Minnesota's 68% turnout topped the nation in 1984, due at least in part to election-day registration.    America's new universal electorate makes voter turnout itself a useful measurement of citizen interest in government affairs. Opinion surveys by the University of Michigan's Center for Political Studies show that about a third of those questioned say they follow public affairs &quot;most of the time.&quot; Another third answer &quot;some of the time,&quot; and the rest say &quot;only now and then&quot; or &quot;hardly at all.&quot; Voter turnout patterns reinforce these survey results.    Mid-term elections for federal senators and representatives attract just a third of the potential electorate, presumably the hard core of citizens who follow politics most of the time. The extra glitz and glamor of a presidential race draw in enough of the some-of-the times to bring just over half of the potential electorate to the polls. The rest never show up at all.    Candidates naturally aim for the some-of-the-time group in designing and advertising their campaign themes. This target group is more likely than the always-voters to call themselves &quot;independents,&quot; with no strong attachment to either political party. They're also more likely to remain undecided until late in the campaign.    The deep pool of potential voters 30 to 45 years old is, say some political strategists, the least ideological of all age groups. In a newsletter to constituents this year, Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) gave a clinical evaluation of how candidates appeal to this category of people:    &quot;Perhaps more than other voters, they are attracted to candidates who emphasize broad themes. Candidates who have a five-point plan for every problem do not make as good an impression on these voters as do those who appeal to values and lifestyle.&quot;    Politicians are often criticized for playing down specific &quot;issues,&quot; but they do it because it works. In a television age, five-point plans sound boring. For congressional candidates fighting anonymity, personal attacks on opponents are more riveting on the tube. Would-be presidents want to sound inspirational, not technical.    Smart candidates also play to the profile of the people who actually vote -- citizens who are formally schooled, mature in years and well-paid at their jobs. Politicians can dangle only a limited list of government attractions before these generally comfortable people. Just about all federal candidates vote to protect Social Security, the government's biggest middle-class entitlement program, and the tax deduction for home-mortgage interest. The list of more overtly political issues that politicians can profitably raise (on either side) is short: abortion, gun control, environment, school prayer, capital punishment. Beyond that, campaigns often drift into abstraction about &quot;leadership&quot; and the ability to &quot;get things done,&quot; often code words for skills at the federal pork barrel.    Such foggy rhetoric reflects a 30-year-long weakening of the Democratic and Republican parties. They have fewer and fewer strong adherents divided by clear lines of traditional left-right ideology. Political parties take their energy from class resentments and social cleavages, historically deeper in Europe than in America. Those cleavages have grown ever shallower here since the last big politically energizing events -- the Great Depression and World War II. With both parties getting weaker as organized rallying points for voters, some analysts see a &quot;dealignment&quot; of American politics.    In a way, the nation's protracted era of relative peace and prosperity has produced a new kind of political division in the '70s and '80s, pitting those who view the state as beneficial against people who consider the state irrelevant to their daily lives. Walter Dean Burnham, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls these skeptics the &quot;party of nonvoters.&quot;    Students of the long cycles of U.S. politics believe it will take a jolting new crisis to end the &quot;dealignment.&quot; If such an event occurs, political parties will be re-energized around new causes and passions, and more people will charge angrily to the polls. Until then, however, politicians will no doubt continue to promise little of substance, and would-be voters will continue to find other things to do on election day.    ---   Mr. Large, a former reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau, is working on a book about voter turnout.    ---                           Who Votes   Results of a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll of 36,442voters nationwide conducted on Election Day, 1986                                                % of Total    Age    18 to 24                                        7%    25 to 34                                       19    35 to 49                                       32    50 to 64                                       26    65 or older                                    16    Education    Grade school                                   12%    High school                                    53    College graduate                               35    Household income    Less than $19,999                              25%    $20,000 to $39,999                             38    $40,000 to $74,999                             27    $75,000 or more                                 7    Not sure                                        3    Occupation    Professional/Managerial                        36%    Retired                                        16    Blue collar                                    14    White collar                                   13    Housewife                                      13    Student                                         3    Unemployed                                      3    Farmer                                          2    Union Household    Yes                                            25%    No                                             73    Not sure                                        2    Party    Strong Republican                              22%    Weak Republican                                 9    Strictly independent                           26    Strong Democrat                                26    Weak Democrat                                  10    Something else or not sure                      7</TEXT></DOC>
