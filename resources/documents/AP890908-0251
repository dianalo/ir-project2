WILSON</HEAD><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government Friday quickly replaced the two topofficials of Italy's largest bank who resigned in a scandalinvolving at least $1.7 billion in unauthorized export credits toIraq by the bank's branch in Atlanta.   Treasury Minister Guido Carli appointed Giampiero Cantoni aschairman of the state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) andPaolo Savona as director-general.   Cantoni replaces Nerio Nesi and Savona succeeds Giacomo Pedde.They had stepped down late Thursday at an extraordinary meeting ofthe bank's board.   Cantoni, a Socialist, was serving as chairman of IstitutoBancario Italiano, a state-controlled commercial bank in Milan.Savona, a Republican, is an economics professor at the University ofRome and long-time adviser of Carli.   The nominations require Parliamentary approval. BNL is 74-percentowned by the Treasury.   The resignations came three weeks after the bank announced it haduncovered transactions by its Atlanta branch that were neitherauthorized by the bank's North American management nor its Romeheadquarters.   The 2,500 transactions, believed to span three years, wereletters of credit covering exports of agricultural products,industrial machinery and plants to Iraq. The bank has said no armsshipments were involved.   The bank said the letters of credit, while correct technically,exceeded the credit ceiling the Rome office had set for the Atlantabranch.   The Treasury said Thursday that based on available information,BNL apparently hadn't suffered losses of assets as a result of thetransactions.   However, its statement noted the operations have resulted ``in anincrease in the credit risk thanks to the concentration ofoperations toward one particular country.''   On Thursday, BNL said its auditing of the off-balance sheetoperations at the Atlanta branch showed irregular export creditstotaling $2.64 billion. Of this amount $1.72 billion already hasbeen disbursed.   The Atlanta branch has made pledges for the remaining $920million, but the actual transactions still need to be executed andBNL said it's trying to determine whether these commitments arelegally binding.   Meanwhile, Matrix-Churchill Ltd, a British manufacturer ofmachine tools with possible military applications, said Friday itsold equipment to Iraq on credit arranged by BNL.   Letters of credit issued by the Italian bank were used in anunspecified portion of the company's $12.4 million in sales to Iraqlast year, Matrix-Churchill spokesman David Phillips said.   The United States, Italy and Britain all prohibit the export oflethal weapons and militarily sensitive technology to Iraq.   Matrix-Churchill, based in Coventry, England and controlled by anIraqi-owned holding company, makes computer-controlled lathes usedin the manufacture of a variety of industrial and military equipment.   Despite their possible military applications, the lathes wereapproved for export to Iraq by the U.K. Department of Trade andIndustry, Phillips said.   A department spokesman declined comment on the case. A sourcefamiliar with the export regulations, however, said machine toolsthat aren't exclusively military in application could well have beenapproved for export.   Italian press reports said BNL chairman Nesi had balked atresigning during a stormy six-hour meeting of the bank's boardThursday night, and in a resignation letter expressed ``greatbitterness.''</TEXT></DOC>
