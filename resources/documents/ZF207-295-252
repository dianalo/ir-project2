AICorp claimsthat both the micro and the mainframe versions are 100% compatible so thatdevelopers can run anything built on the mainframe on a micro by using thefile transfer facility on, for example, the ASCII file format.andP;  The range ofdatabase interfaces on the mainframe version, however, is not on KBMS/PC, butvia file transfer it can reason with corporate data stored in DB2 or IMSdatabases with the products' Systems Application Architecture Common UserAccess compliancy offering seamless integration.andP;  The company sees two mainmarkets for KBMS/PC: buyers taking a first look at Expert System technologywho would see the stand-alone product as a low- cost, low-risk way ofbringing knowldege-based management into their company; the second marketwill be composed of developers wanting a workstation tool on which to build,test and maintain mainframe applications without using up precious mainframeresources.andP;  Both the OS/2 and MS-DOS versions cost #6,500, run on 80286 or80386 machines and respectively run under OS/2 1.0 and above, or MS-DOS 2.0and above.andP;  The management system takes up 2Mb of memory, but requires 4Mb tofunction properly with a knowledge base and data storage.andP;  A run-time versionof specific applications on multiple in-house and remote micros will also beandM;available later in the year.andP;   -  Katy Ring</TEXT></DOC>
