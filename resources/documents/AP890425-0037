(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police arrested 58 flag-waving,slogan-chanting animal rights activists after they blocked trafficin a busy intersection and forced open a door at the NationalInstitutes of Health.   ``This is the first step in voicing your opinion and letting itbe known that people are opposed to this kind of cruelty toanimals,'' said Zakki Jewad, 25, of Silver Spring, Md.   Organizers said the aim of the demonstration in this WashingtonD.C. suburb was to kick off a week of civil disobedience andrallies at research centers and universities nationwide.   ``We're protesting the murders of millions of animals inresearch laboratories every year,'' said Lee Warren, 61, ofBaltimore, who came to Monday's rally toting a sign and dressed ina full-length black cape and hood to represent death.   During the demonstration, about 200 activists gathered on NIH'sgrassy lawn for speeches and vegetarian lunches. NIH was targetedfor the demonstration because it is the largest funding source foranimal research, protesters said.   Police arrested 37 activists after they linked hands and blockedtraffic on a busy street for about 30 minutes. Officers draggedmany across the road to allow traffic to get by. They were chargedwith disobeying a police officer and were released at the scene,according to Montgomery County police.   Following the arrests, the protesters proceeded to NIH's mainadministration building where they began to pound on doors andwindows of the facility. One of the doors broke open and policearrested 21 of the protestors and charged them with trespassing.Some also were charged with breaking and entering, according to NIHofficials.   ``I really feared for the safety of the building,'' said Dr.William Raub, NIH Deputy Director. ``That group was absolutely outof control.''   Ginger Redmon, who said she had been arrested in two otheranimal rights protests, said the civil disobedience ``shows we havea strong commitment.''   Raub denied that animals were mistreated at NIH. ``It's afabricated story from start to finish,'' he said. ``There's nobasis for that claim.''   To defend their research, medical and scientific experimentersplan to use this week to speak out in support of the use of animalsin medical research, pointing to the medical breakthroughs suchresearch has brought _ from coronary bypass surgery to cataractremoval, from vaccines to antibiotics.   ``There's no such thing as anybody not having received somebenefit from animal research,'' said Frankie Trull, president ofthe Foundation for Biomedical Research, a nonprofit group thatsupports animal research.   Animal research defenders also say most laboratory experimentsaren't painful and about 90 percent of the animals used in suchresearch are rodents bred specifically for lab experimentation.   But Ingrid Newkirk, director of People for the Ethical Treatmentof Animals, said too much money goes toward unnecessary animalresearch.   She estimated that the federal government spends as much as $6billion a year on research using animals and said the same resultscould be derived in ways that don't harm or kill animals.   ``When it comes to feelings, they (scientists) believe that arat is nothing more than a test tube,'' Newkirk said.</TEXT></DOC>
