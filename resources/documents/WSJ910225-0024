It is beginning to look as if the pot is about empty.   Lured by the promise of leveraged buy-outs, the bigsecurities firm in the late 1980s started shoveling hundredsof millions of its own dollars into loans and investments incompanies such as Revco D.S., TVX Broadcast Group, EnvirodyneIndustries and Grand Union.</LP><TEXT>   Salomon is known as a savvy short-term trader of bonds andcommodities. It had little experience making long-term equityinvestments and big bridge loans, which weren't always astemporary as intended. And it helped take Revco and GrandUnion private at high prices, in billion-dollar deals.   Today, Salomon has little to show from its foray into LBOsand, indeed, might have done better if it had used the LBOmoney to trade bonds. Revco went bust in 1988 -- it was thefirst big buy-out to wind up in Chapter 11 bankruptcyproceedings. And some analysts say heavy debts are strainingGrand Union and Envirodyne.   Now there is talk that Salomon wants to unload its GrandUnion investments or even quit merchant banking entirely.Sometimes it doesn't pay when a company strays too far fromits corporate traditions.   Michael Zimmerman, who runs Salomon's merchant banking,says: &quot;Merchant banking was never a primary engine ofSalomon's activities. We remain committed to merchantbanking, but obviously are conducting the business in a wayconsistent with today's changed environment.&quot; Salomon is saidto be intrigued by a newer fashion -- buying companies thathave already gone bust or need restructuring.   Currently, Salomon is stuck with about $150 million inloans to Grand Union, the big supermarket chain that Salomonbought with partners in 1989 from British financier JamesGoldsmith. The Grand Union loans include about $95 million ofa &quot;temporary&quot; bridge loan that Salomon hoped to unload in1989, and a new $15 million credit line that Salomon had toextend to the company last August. The rest is a secured termloan.   Salomon, which uses &quot;conservative accounting,&quot; Mr.Zimmerman says, has largely written down its LBO equitystakes, including about $30 million originally put intoEnvirodyne, which makes sausage skins and plastic cutlery,and $30 million in Grand Union. If the latter hasn't repaidmost of Salomon's new $15 million loan by May, it will giveSalomon more Grand Union stock.   Salomon temporarily had to write down a $300 millioninvestment in TVX Broadcast's shaky television stations, butin 1989 got its money back when it sold TVX to ParamountCommunications. Salomon has completely written off its $7million stake in Revco.   To be sure, Salomon earned investment banking feesamounting to around $100 million from these four LBOs; thefees mostly offset its equity investments. Mr. Zimmermansays: &quot;I try not to think about fees; I'm trying to make gooduse of Salomon's capital.&quot;   Still, &quot;given the uncertain state of the economy, Salomonwould do just as well to leave these wonderful LBOopportunities to someone else,&quot; says analyst John Keefe ofBarclays de Zoete Wedd. Among securities firms, only MorganStanley really got rich from LBO investments; First Bostonlost heavily on bridge loans.   Salomon currently has no LBO disasters on its hands. Itdidn't lure outside investors into an LBO fund, and &quot;we hadto be more conservative because we were using only our owncapital,&quot; Mr. Zimmerman says. But some analysts doubt it everwill make much money on its merchant banking exposure, nowcarried on its books at about $200 million. By contrast, in1990's good trading markets, Salomon earned almost 15% on itsequity; even after fourth-quarter bond losses, it made 12% onequity, says Barclays's Mr. Keefe.   After troubles with Revco and TVX Broadcast, Salomonsought good managers to run its LBOs. In 1989, it boughtEnvirodyne with Donald Kelly, formerly of Beatrice; it wentinto Grand Union with Gary Hirsch, a grocery-empire builderwho runs Penn Traffic and has made money for Salomon in thepast. Salomon paid a pittance in 1989 for 500,000 PennTraffic shares now valued at about $10 million.   But to make money from LBOs, investors must pick companiesthat can quickly cut their debt, boosting the value ofshareholders' equity. Grand Union, with many stores inupstate New York, is hurting. Though Mr. Hirsch says thechain is meeting its targets and &quot;we're happy with ourownership,&quot; Grand Union might in the next year need torefinance part of its $1 billion in long-term debt, accordingto Moody's Investors Service.   The chain's big debt payments are a strain, even thoughcash flow from operations has grown by more than 25% sinceMr. Hirsch took the reins. For the fiscal third quarterthrough Jan. 5, Grand Union just reported that sales at olderstores fell by 0.7%; its net loss was $24 million.   Envirodyne makes half of all sausage skins in the U.S. anda lot of plastic knives and forks. But with &quot;low-growth&quot;businesses and debt of about $760 million, &quot;how can it growits way out of its debt?&quot; asks Jefferies andamp; Co. analyst MarkNeuner. &quot;That's why its bonds trade the way they do,&quot; at bigdiscounts, he adds.   Today, Salomon's only LBO returns are coming from its roleas Grand Union's lender, and those returns are scant. Its oldbridge loan was converted into low-rated notes that aren'tdue to pay cash interest till 1994.</TEXT></DOC>
