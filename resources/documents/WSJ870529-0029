Of 25 major brokerage-firm analysts asked by Hill andamp; Knowlton, a public relations firm, 16 want the full annual report complete with financial statements.    Some were quite vehement in resisting any change. &quot;If a company did this, I wouldn't follow them anymore,&quot; said one New York analyst. Issuers of abbreviated annual reports &quot;are really showing contempt for the typical shareholder,&quot; said another.    Last January, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave General Motors Corp. permission to pare the annual report if the full financial data are included in the proxy and 10K report filed with the SEC. GM said such reports are becoming too intricate, legalistic and costly. Another company that has expressed interest in a shortened annual report is McKesson Corp., a San Francisco-based drug concern.    Companies that want to pare their annual reports should weigh the savings and simplicity with &quot;the risk of turning off some professional investors,&quot; said Ned Reynolds, a Hill andamp; Knowlton senior vice president.    The summary report first was studied by the Financial Executives Institute and Deloitte, Haskins andamp; Sells, a major accounting firm, in 1983. &quot;Summary reports aren't intended to meet the needs of all analysts, who can get full financial data from other SEC filings,&quot; said Robert Kueppers, a Deloitte partner. </TEXT></DOC>
