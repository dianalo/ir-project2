The purchase is subject to approval of Datacopy's holders. The transaction, which Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox expects to complete in July, would give Xerox &quot;the widest range of scanning products&quot; in the U.S., according to a spokesman.    Datacopy, Mountain View, Calif., will become a subsidiary of Xerox's Document Systems Business unit, which also holds Kurzweil Computer Products, itself a maker of desktop scanners.    Datacopy has 4.8 million shares outstanding. The total price also reflects 800,000 shares covered by options at $2.25 apiece.    Scanners read printed material and put it in digital form; the data then can be stored, formed and manipulated with computers. Scanners have applications in areas including desktop publishing and scientific and foreign languages.    Xerox is a business machines and financial services company.    Datacopy shares closed Friday at $5.625, up 62.5 cents, in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
