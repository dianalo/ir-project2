It was the latest in a series of moves toward pluralism in in acountry where television and radio have been under state controlsince their inception.   Government spokesman Athanassios Kanellopoulos said the licenseswill be given to two publishing consortiums, Tiletypos Corp. andAntenna-TV, made up of representatives from Greece's diverse andoften partisan press.   Both stations will transmit locally, not nationally, and thestate will share in about 5 percent of the profits, he added.   The three state-run TV networks in Greece belong to the HellenicRadio and Televison Corp.   The state monopoly on radio was broken two years ago when themunicipality of Athens set up a station.   Popular demand and pirate TV stations also led the formerSocialist government to begin allowing in six internationalsatellite channels, including Cable News Network.   The center-right New Democracy party, the majority member in theConservative-Communist coalition government, had made private TV apart of its campaign platform for last month's elections.</TEXT></DOC>
