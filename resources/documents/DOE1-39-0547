<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-0547 </DOCNO><TEXT>This invention provides an improved shield for use with an x-ray machine.The shield can control the dose of x-rays applied by the machine in differentareas without affecting the power of the x-rays. This is achieved witha shield especially designed and positioned to intercept with x-raysfor longer or shorter periods in different areas during the taking ofthe picture, but not for the whole period of time necessary for takingthis picture. Each area of the subject being x-rayed is exposed to fullpower x-rays. However, owing to the shield, the areas that require smallerdose receive these full power x-rays for a shorter portion of the timerequired to take the picture while the other areas that require largerdose of x-rays, receive the full power x-rays for a longer portion ofthe full period of time required to take the picture. To ensure thisdifferential exposure, the shield is placed through the path of the x-raysand rotated about an axis which is generally transverse to the directionof travel of the x-rays to cut out some of said x-rays for differentportions of the period of time necessary for taking the picture. Theshield is preferably shaped to intercept x-rays for a longer period insome areas than in others depending on the required doses. A pluralityof differently shaped shields can be provided to suit different picturetaking situations.</TEXT></DOC>
