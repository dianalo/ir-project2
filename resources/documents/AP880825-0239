Traffic Japan, the wildlife trade monitoring group of the WorldWide Fund for Nature, said the South American caiman skins wereshipped by a complex route involving at least seven South Americanand Asian countries before they arrived in Japan.   At least 46 tons of the skins, from more than 120,000alligators, entered Japan in the first seven months of this yearthrough Thailand alone, the group said. It said it believed theskins were part of a larger shipment that was loaded ontoAsia-bound ships off the coast of Uruguay at the end of last year.   The declared customs value of the skins was about 427 millionyen (about $3.2 million), ``but retail value would be four to fivetimes more,'' spokeswoman Cecila Song said. The skins are used inJapan mainly for belts and watchbands.   Permits are required for the export of South American caimanskins under the regulations of the Convention on InternationalTrade in Endangered Species (CITES), an international treatyregulating trade in protected plants and animals, Song said.   Japanese officials allowed the shipments to enter the countrywithout proper verification of the export documents, the group saidin a statement.   ``Traffic's 8-month investigation has revealed a serious lapseof CITES administration in Thailand and Japan, and has uncovered along paper trail of illegal CITES documents and other ploysinvolving Thailand, Colombia, Chile, Venezuela and Singapore tomask the illegal origins of the poached skins,'' the statement said.   It said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry hadresponded to evidence of illegal caiman trade by instituting a newvoluntary check system on all imports of the skins.   ``But unless they come up with a system involving legalpenalties, we don't think there will be any improvement, especiallywith the high profits involved,'' Song said.   Ministry officials were not available Thursday night for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
