(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Gina SmithandM;In a DOS world once ruled by Microsoft Corp. and IBM alone, Digital ResearchInc. appears to be slicing its own profitable piece of the market.andM;DRI claims to have sold more than 2.5 million licenses worldwide for itsDR-DOS since it was introduced a year ago this month, a figure analysts callunexpected and impressive given the relative market size and the weight ofthe competition.andM;Comparatively, Microsoft has sold 12.3 million licenses for MS-DOS and IBMhas shipped 11.3 million copies of PC-DOS worldwide, according to figuresprovided by Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm in San Jose, Calif.andM;DR-DOS is 100 percent compatible with IBM's PC-DOS and Microsoft Corp.'sMS-DOS versions 3.X and later, but includes several features not present inthose systems and costs OEMs two-thirds less, analysts say.andP;  The software isnot sold commercially.andM;''DRI is making big inroads with DR-DOS,'' said Fred Thorlin, an analyst withDataquest.andM;''[DR-DOS] is important -- it is the first successful DOS clone and itssuccess shows DOS is becoming a commodity,'' he said.andM;Users of the operating system agreed, saying DR-DOS is faster and cheaper andoffers more features than its big-name counterparts.andP;  Among those featuresare an on-line help system, file and directory passwords, file retrieval andother system utilities, and the ability to embed the software in ROM.andM;''Digital Research produced DOS the way it should have been done in the firstplace,'' said Paul Colvin, a computer consultant with PC Technologies Inc. inLos Angeles and a DR-DOS user.andP;  ''It's a much cleaner, faster system than[MS- and PC-] DOS, and it's cheaper.''andM;In addition, Colvin said, DR-DOS' built-in utilities -- which allow users torebuild destroyed data files -- set DR-DOS apart from its competition.andM;DRI already had operating-system experience when it released DR-DOS a yearago, according to company officials.andP;  DRI first entered the operating-systemmarket 10 years ago with its CP/M, a direct ascendant of Microsoft's andIBM's DOS.andM;DRI's expertise in the multiuser arena, honed in its creation of ConcurrentDOS four years ago, allowed the company to create a DOS system that is moreefficient than its competitors', the officials said.andM;''Concurrent DOS had a smaller and faster file system, and we took the kernelout and put it into [DR-DOS],'' said Frank Iveson, vice president of sales atthe Monterey, Calif., company.andM;Users of the system say that distinction is apparent.andM;''I've noticed a very visible difference in performance between DR-DOS and[MS- and PC-DOS],'' said John Dunkle, vice president of Work GroupTechnologies Inc., a consulting firm in Hampton, N.H.andP;  ''One thing DRI hasreally done is add value to the DOS system.''andM;Some users say they purchased DR-DOS instead of upgrading from MS-DOS 3.3.1to PC-DOS or MS-DOS 4.0.andM;''I was using MS-DOS 3.3, but I switched over because DR-DOS lets you create[hard-disk] partitions larger than 32M bytes,'' said Rob Johnson, a designengineer with the John D. Hollingsworth on Wheels textile-manufacturing firmin Greenville, S.C.andM;While MS- and PC-DOS 4.01 also allow large partitions, Johnson considered theDOS 4.0 releases ''too full of bugs.''andM;''DR-DOS is faster on the disk I/O [input/ output], it lets you 'password'files and directories, and it has more commands,'' Johnson said, adding thathe has no plans to return to the realm of PC- and MS-DOS.andM;''I see no reason to go back,'' he said.andP;  ''My next operating system will beOS/2 or something else -- maybe some version of Unix.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
