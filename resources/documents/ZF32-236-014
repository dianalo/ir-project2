 And other producers are increasinglycreating similar high-end output with their Macintosh systems.andM;Recording frame by frame.andP;  On the Macintosh, animations are stored asindividual images or as special sequential image files (usually as PICS) ondisk.andP;  Each image may take up to several seconds to retrieve and render invideo form, and the videotape must be moving at full speed to lay down auseful image.andP;  To accomplish this, the tape must be backed up, then runforward to get up to speed before recording each image (both the process andinterval are known as &quot;preroll&quot;).andP;  To overcome the normal slip and inaccuracyof the tape movement, the recorder must position the tape and begin recordingat a precise position marked by a frame number (or timecode).andP;  This calls fora special frame-accurate videotape recorder with a computer interface.andM;Working through animation and multimedia programs or directly with imagefiles -- using either separate image files or sequences stored as PICS files-- the controller advances to each image in turn, converts it to video formatand records it to tape.andM;Slow process.andP;  Transferring animation to tape is a lengthy process,experienced producers say.andM;&quot;It took more than 9,000 separate images to make the animation for the videoused to open the TEXPO 90 [telephone technology] show in Anaheim,&quot; saidRobert May, president of Ikonics Interactive MultiMedia of San Francisco.andO;&quot;And it took close to a week to lay them off to videotape.&quot; Those 9,000images made up a five-minute video.andM;With a normal three-quarter-inch or Betacam recorder, you can put down about200 frames per hour, according to Bass and Potter.andM;Recording speeds up to 2,000 frames per hour have been reported forrecordable videodiscs and digital image recorders, such as Abekas VideoSystems' A60 digital video recorder.andP;  But that might be faster than theMacintosh can output complex images; the speed at which it can rendergraphics depends on the processor, graphics board and the type of files beingrendered.andM;About a half-dozen controller models are available for the Mac, includingsoftware-only packages, internal boards and external controllers.andM;Controllers without hardware.andP;  Software-only controllers -- which use aserial port on the Macintosh to connect to a videotape recorder -- areincluded as part of some multimedia programs, but there are also stand-aloneproducts, such as MacVAC/S from Advanced Digital Imaging of Irvine, Calif.andM;The main advantage of the software approach is its lower cost.andP;  Thesoftware-only version of MacVAC lists for $1,495, while a hardware controllerfrom Advanced Digital Imaging lists for more than twice as much.andM;Advocates of other approaches say software-only controllers are notsufficiently accurate because there is no independent check of the recorder'sreporting of tape position.andP;  And they claim that some nominallyframe-accurate videotape recorders may occasionally be inaccurate.andM;Add-in boards.andP;  Internal boards include the same basic abilities as thesoftware-only systems, but they give more independence from various videotapeinterfaces.andP;  For example, the DQ-Animaq ($3,250 to $3,750) from Diaquest Inc.andO;of Berkeley, Calif., provides a consistent interface to software regardlessof which recorder is used.andM;Boards also support a wider range of hardware than a software-and-serial-portconfiguration.andP;  In addition to linking machines with serial controlinterfaces, the Desktop Model of the DQ-Animaq can be configured forvideotape machines using parallel interfaces.andM;In addition, the Diaquest line contains a microprocessor for operationsindependent of the Macintosh CPU.andP;  This allows the board to execute atransfer while the Mac is setting up a new image, resulting in fasterthroughput.andP;  DQAnimaq software can be configured as a Control Panel device(cdev) or MacroMind Director X-Object, allowing it to run within otherprograms.andM;Other controllers.andP;  External controllers also perform the same basicfunctions, but they are independent of the Macintosh architecture.andP;  Lyon LambVideo Animation Systems Inc. of Burbank, Calif., says its MiniVAS and ProVASunits ($4,500 to $12,500, depending on options) work with &quot;every computerplatform.&quot; The units feature the company's proprietary frame code, which LyonLamb claims provides an extra degree of accuracy.andP;  For projects that requirea range of equipment, the unit also supports the industry-standard SMPTE(Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) timecode used by mosthigh-end video systems.andM;MiniVAS and ProVAS, as well as the Series II from Diaquest, use the Mac'sserial port for control and a separate graphics card for the video signal.andM;Video card needed.andP;  The video output signal must be produced by a separatevideo graphics board (an internal card that generates a video-compatiblesignal) operating at NTSC (National Television System Committee) timingrates.andP;  NTSC video requires an interlaced signal, as opposed to the Mac'snon-interlaced RGB (red, green, blue) signal.andP;  Video cards that deliver asignal in RGB format also need an external encoder to produce the compositecolor signal needed by most videotape recorders.andM;The investment needed for a complete video animation system, say producers,runs between $10,000 and $50,000, not including the Mac.andM;&quot;It's a highly technical business,&quot; said Bill Villarreal, a graphic systemspecialist at The Post Group of Hollywood, Calif.andP;  In many cases, he said,animators may do better to create the images on their own Macs and recordthem at a production house.andM;High-end animation is not for the faint of heart, short of time, nor frail ofbudget, but the final picture is nothing less than moving.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
