Miller and Laurie P. CohenStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><TEXT>   A few days after federal marshals arrested three high-level Wall Street traders last month, Barton Biggs, a top managing director of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., posed a weighty question at the investment-banking firm's weekly staff meeting.    &quot;What do you get if you cross a pig with a Wall Streeter?&quot; Mr. Biggs asked, as hundreds of employees listened and watched over the in-house video system. &quot;Nothing. There are some things even a pig won't do.&quot;    This is an unsettling time for investment bankers. Their clients are giving them funny looks and asking them suspicious questions. Their friends are inquiring whether they have been carted away in handcuffs yet or whether they can move their regular tennis game to the penitentiary courts. One successful investment banker says his mother, who never could figure out how he made all that money, is starting to worry about him.    All of a sudden, the people who work in what has been this era's most gilded profession are finding their job title turned into a dirty word. It is an awkward development for a business that lives on power, prestige and self-assurance.    &quot;It's not one of the most glorious epochs in the history of investment banking,&quot; concedes Peter Solomon, vice chairman of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;People's first reaction these days when you say you're an investment banker is, 'What's going on with the insider-trading case?' It's like being asked about Iran if you're in the White House.&quot;    All over the country, the sound of Wall Street hotshots not bragging about their jobs is deafening. One of them recalls a painful moment on a recent ski vacation when his chairlift-mate asked him what he did. &quot;For the first time in 10 years in this business, I was ashamed to admit I'm an investment banker,&quot; he says.    A takeover specialist tells of returning from an overseas trip shortly after the latest round of arrests and stepping up to the customs counter to declare his profession. &quot;Are you sure you want to come back into the country right now?&quot; the agent asked.    &quot;It's guilt by association,&quot; laments Jonathan Morgan, the head of mergers at San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities. Mr. Morgan found himself sitting next to a big oil company's general counsel on a recent flight to Chicago and politely mentioned his profession. &quot;Then I'm one of your victims,&quot; the oil executive responded.    &quot;I said to myself, 'Victims! That really hurts!'&quot; Mr. Morgan recalls. &quot;I take my job extremely seriously, and I don't like to feel sullied.&quot;    Arbitrage, the speculative trading that has been at the heart of the scandals, is especially ignominious these days. Last week readers of the &quot;Doonesbury&quot; comic strip met Clayton, a young arb trying frantically to become a millionaire before he turns 30. &quot;He's an arbitrager and he hasn't made his first million? What's the matter with him?&quot; asks his boss. Clayton seizes the trading-floor microphone and pleads, &quot;Attention! Does anyone have any inside information he's not using?&quot;    &quot;Right now,&quot; says one arb, &quot;being an arbitrager is kind of like being a fire hydrant at a dog show -- you sure get a lot of attention.&quot;    &quot;I go to a party now and I just tell people I'm an investor -- I invest in art,&quot; he says. &quot;Arbitrage is an art, after all.&quot;    Not long ago, jokes about investment bankers focused on predatory styles of deal-making. (How many investment bankers does it take to change a lightbulb? Two: One to smash the bulb with a baseball bat and one to find buyers for the fragments.)    This winter's jokes have a different theme: Two drunks are stumbling through the graveyard of Trinity Church, in the heart of New York's financial district, when one trips on a tombstone. He peers down and reads the inscription: &quot;Here lies an investment banker and an honest man,&quot; it says. &quot;Hey, Charlie,&quot; the drunk yells to his friend, &quot;it's getting so crowded here they're burying them two to a grave!&quot;    In the new climate on Wall Street, traders who used to exude machismo are rushing to proclaim their virtue. &quot;When people ask me how I'm doing,&quot; says one investment banker, &quot;I tell them, 'Fine. And unindicted.'&quot;    Kenneth R. Leibler, the president of the American Stock Exchange, recently saw a prominent financier at an industry luncheon approach a federal official involved in the insider-trading cases. Mr. Leibler recalls that the banker asked: &quot;Will you make any comment about the Broesky affair?&quot;    &quot;Aren't you talking about the Boesky affair?&quot; said the fed. &quot;Right,&quot; responded the financier. &quot;I didn't want you to know that I even heard of the guy.&quot;    Some clients are seizing the opportunity to become feistier with their investment bankers. &quot;The whole industry has always been based on arrogance, but now when they call me they're much more humble,&quot; gloats one corporate executive. Shearson Lehman's Mr. Solomon says his clients suddenly want to know all about the firm's precautions against insider trading. &quot;They ask you questions that they once felt would have offended you,&quot; he says.    Marvin Gearhart, the chairman of a Fort Worth, Texas, oilfield-services concern, recently sat down with two Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. officers hired to help restructure the debt of his company, Gearhart Industries Inc. He recalls that at the end of the meeting, he smiled and asked, &quot;'Shouldn't we let Mr. Boesky in on this?' They both gave me dirty looks and didn't say anything.&quot;    The ultimate disgrace for investment banking may be the treatment the profession has gotten from some trendy New York-based magazines. Two of the trendiest -- M (aimed at &quot;the civilized man&quot;) and Avenue -- recently published glossy features about the best spots for serving sentences for white-collar crime.    M wrote that its guide was for &quot;those Wall Streeters and other gentlemen who fear that today's overzealous prosecutorial bent against robber barony may soon make them due for a mandatory vacation inside one of the Club Feds.&quot;    For the record, the prison of choice in both magazines is Allenwood, a 4,000-acre institution in central Pennsylvania. M praises its &quot;deluxe&quot; athletic facilities, including a two-mile jogging trail and clay tennis courts. Avenue advises the pinstripers that Allenwood is &quot;one of the country's most attractive minimum-security facilities.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
