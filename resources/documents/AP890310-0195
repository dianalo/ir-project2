STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The leftist Social Democrats and West Berlin'sequivalent of the anti-NATO Greens formed a government Friday thatpledges to reduce Allied military control of the city and curbpolice action against street protest.   The coalition agreement between the Social Democrats and thefar-left Alternative List won nearly unanimous approval Friday at aspecial Social Democrat congress. An Alternative List meeting isscheduled for Sunday.   Walter Momper of the Social Democrats is to become mayor when thenew legislature meets next week, replacing Eberhard Diepgen, whoseChristian Democrats were set back in the Jan. 29 city elections.   Voters gave the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats 55 seatseach in the 138-member legislature and the Alternative List got 17.The far-right Republican Party won the other 11.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats have been slippingin opinion polls, and the so-called ``Red-Green'' government in WestBerlin will be a major test of whether such a coalition can worknationally.   Several polls have indicated Kohl's center-right coalition maylose the national elections in December 1990.   ``I think that with this Red-Green coalition ... alternativepolicies will play a much more essential role than before in thecity and on the federal level,'' Alternative List leader ChristianStroebele told reporters.   He said there will be ``decisive change in the city and that willhave a ripple effect'' throughout West Germany.   Under the agreement, the Alternative List will control three citydepartments: environment and development, schooling and sports, andwomen, youth and family.   The party has advocated stronger environmental controls, curbs onpolice, restrictions on the use of motor vehicles and moregovernment-subsidized housing.   Otto Schily, a prominent Greens member of the federal parliament,said his party and the Social Democrats should study the possibilityof a national coalition.   Business spokesmen have said some companies might leave WestBerlin because of the leftist government, particularly if it raisestaxes to finance social programs.   The Christian Democrats had dominated city politics in recentyears and promoted business develoment to help reduce the isolationof West Berlin, which is 90 miles inside communist East German.</TEXT></DOC>
