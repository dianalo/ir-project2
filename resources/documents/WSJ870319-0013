StakeOf 12% Is PurchasedBy Synder Oil Partners</HL><DD> 03/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CRGTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><DATELINE> FORT WORTH, Texas </DATELINE><TEXT>   Snyder Oil Partners L.P. said it purchased a 12% stake in Cenergy Corp., a Dallas-based independent energy concern.    Snyder's stock purchase was made on the open market and in a private purchase from L.D. Brinkman, a Kerrville, Texas, business executive in the past two weeks. Snyder's acquisition of 1,170,400 Cenergy common shares follows the acquisition of 13.2%, or about 1.3 million Cenergy common shares, by Bryson Oil andamp; Gas PLC earlier this month.    Bryson, a Belfast, Northern Ireland-based energy exploration company, has said that it might seek to influence Cenergy's management and requested a list of Cenergy shareholders as it weighs a bid for control of the company.    Cenergy is trying to block the request for its shareholder list in a Nevada federal court. A Cenergy official declined to comment on the stock holdings of Bryson and Snyder.    Snyder said in a statement that it is &quot;continuing to review its investment in Cenergy and hasn't made a determination at this time of its future course of action, if any.&quot; A Snyder spokeswoman declined to elaborate.    According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Brinkman, president of LDBrinkman Corp., a concern with interests in floor coverings, pizza restaurants and modular housing, said he and members of his family sold 908,500 Cenergy common shares to Snyder on March 14. Of the total, the Brinkmans sold 302,833 shares for $2.8 million, or about $9.00 a share, and exchanged the remaining 605,667 shares for 524,135 Snyder Oil units.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Cenergy closed yesterday at $7.75 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
