Josef A. Maiman, president of London-based Metropolitan Investment Corp., and leader of the investment group, &quot;is looking at the company,&quot; the source said. &quot;Serious discussions&quot; are under way, the source added.    Asked about the talks, Mr. Maiman's Miami-based attorney, James D. Whisenand, said, &quot;We can't make any comment.&quot; He described Mr. Maiman as a Peruvian citizen who has offices in London, several South American countries and Israel.    Royal Crown Cola is a unit of Royal Crown Cos. In 1984, Mr. Posner's Chesapeake Financial Corp. acquired the 72% of Royal Crown it didn't already own in a $241 million leveraged buyout. In a leveraged buyout, a company is taken private in a transaction that is largely financed by borrowing. Ultimately the debt is repaid with money generated by the target company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Mr. Maiman is said to be interested in acquiring only Royal Crown's soft-drink operations, not its Arby's Inc. fast-food restaurant operations.    Both a spokeswoman for Mr. Posner and a spokesman for Royal Crown Cos. declined to comment.    The talks appear to be part of a larger effort by Mr. Posner to bolster the sagging financial situation of his corporate empire.    Last month, for example, Mr. Posner's APL Corp., a tissue-paper and plastics concern, said it sold about 1.3 million shares of Porex Technologies Corp. for $40.6 million, saying it intended to use the proceeds of the sale to bolster the finances of ailing Pennsylvania Engineering Corp., another Posner-controlled corporation. Earlier this year, Mr. Posner's Sharon Steel Corp. filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under court supervision while it works out a plan to pay its debts. </TEXT></DOC>
