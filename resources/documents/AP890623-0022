Both the Soviets and the United States were targets of thecleric's wrath. With Khomeini's passing, Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev is working overtime to reverse a decade of bad feelingsand make inroads with his successors.   But President Bush is standing firm on at least two U.S.preconditions for a resumption of the relations severed by theUnited States in 1980 five months after militants took over theAmerican embassy in Tehran and held the diplomats and Marine guardshostage.   Bush is insisting on renunciation of terrorism and help from Iranto gain the release of the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon bypro-Iranian forces.   It is a waiting game with an element of risk. An opportunitycould be lost. But Secretary of State James A. Baker III andofficials in the State Department who keep close tabs on Iranapparently do not think so.   The post-Khomeini situation is still cloudy. Two viewpoints arestill vying for control. One is the suspicious and fundamentaliststance represented by the ayatollah. Its proponents are as wary asKhomeini was of the United States and the Soviet Union. The secondis less uptight, but not any less inclined to fall under U.S. orSoviet influence.   The era of the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who sought withbillions of dollars of U.S. weapons to be the kingpin of the PersianGulf, is past. ``It is in Iran's interest to play the Third Worldgame of balancing one superpower off against the other,'' a U.S.official explained Thursday. This suggests Gorbachev's drive forbetter ties with Tehran is unlikely to produce a pro-Soviet policyin Iran.   Besides, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity:``Where is the urgency? Where is the fire?''   The Soviets have been negotiating with Iran for three years topurchase Iranian natural gas. The deal isn't struck yet. And itremains the key to improved economic ties between Moscow and Tehran.   Also, Gorbachev also could be running a risk. The Soviets are themain weapons supplier to Iraq, the Iranians' bitterest enemy. IfGorbachev gets too close to Iran he might lose influence in Baghdadand with a number of other Arab countries traditionally hostile tothe Moslem but non-Arab Iranians.   Still, Gorbachev heartily welcomed the speaker of the Iranianparliament, Hashemi Rafsanjani, to Moscow this week. On Thursday,the two sides agreed to exchange delegations of Moslem religiousleaders and the Soviets hinted in a communique they would sendweapons to Iran.   The key phrase in the communique spoke of ``strengthening thedefense capacity'' of Iran. That could mean anything from Sovietspare parts or replacements for armored personnel carriers andartillery, which the Soviets provided Iran before the collapse ofthe shah's Peacock throne a decade ago, to fighter planes.   There was no nuanced phrase when Baker replied to congressionalinquires at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. ``We areconcerned about the possibility of weapons transfers,'' he said.   Referring to his meeting in Moscow with Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze last month, Baker told Rep. William S.Broomfield, D-Mich.: ``We indicated our concern across the wholespectrum of questions involving proliferation of missiles andchemical technology.''   Asked by Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind., about the Soviet embrace,Baker said U.S. policy toward Iran will be guided by developments inthe country _ and not by Iran's relationship with the Soviet Union.   Besides, Baker said, ``We do not know exactly what course thedevelopments in Iran will take.''   This is the same unhurried approach Bush and Baker took at theoutset of the administration when Gorbachev was rolling out a seriesof arms reduction initiatives. Last month, the president producedhis own proposal to reduce Soviet and U.S. forces in Europe as wellas NATO and Warsaw Pact weapons arsenals.   Bush and Baker are taking a similarly measured approach to therepression in China of forces seeking a more liberal Marxist regime.Defending that policy against congressional calls for strongeraction, Baker said the administration was ``taking carefullytargeted actions while not being inflammatory in its rhetoric andpreserving its options for the future.''   Five months old, the Bush administration's foreign policy isdeveloping several characteristics. Among them is an unhurried paceand a basic idea that U.S. actions abroad will be guided by Americanself-interest rather than by flashes of intuitive brilliance.   __   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid heads the AP's State Departmentstaff.</TEXT></DOC>
