The exact cause of the fire wasn't immediately known.Officials said it may have started in the plant's electricalsystem and spread following a rupture in a line carryingflammable hydrogen that is used to keep a generator cool.</LP><TEXT>   Although officials emphasized that the fire occurred inthe non-nuclear side of the plant and that no radiation wasreleased, critics of the industry said the accident wasanother illustration of the potential dangers of nuclearpower.   &quot;Fires are among the most serious accidents because theycan disable safety equipment and potentially interfere withthe reactor cooling system,&quot; said Ken Bossong, director ofenergy issues for Public Citizen, a Washington-basedorganization critical of nuclear power.   A spokeswoman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,noting that none of the plant's nuclear systems was affected,disputed the notion that the fire posed a serious threat topublic safety. &quot;This could've happened at any industrialplant that has a generator,&quot; the spokeswoman said.   The fire was reported at 6:32 p.m. EDT Monday and wasdeclared under control by 10:03 p.m.   The fire chief in Wiscasset, a town of about 3,500 on thesouthern Maine coast, said that despite initial reports of anexplosion, he didn't see any evidence of one. &quot;There'll be alot of cleanup needed, but it wasn't really a big fire,&quot; saidTomothy Merry, chief of the all-volunteer force that backedup the plant's fire brigade. The town wasn't evacuated, hesaid, and most residents didn't know of the fire until it wasreported locally.   Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co., which began operating in1972 and is jointly owned by nine New England utilities, saidthe main transformer and generator may have sustained&quot;serious damage&quot; that could keep the plant out of service forseveral months. The company also said the fire caused an oilleak from the transformer and that about 200 gallons of oilspilled into the nearby Back River through a drain. The spillwas contained by booms.   There weren't any reports of injuries.   Central Maine Power Co. holds the largest stake in MaineYankee, with 38%, followed by New England Power -- a unit ofNew England Electric System, with 20%, and NortheastUtilities, which holds a combined 15% stake throughsubsidiaries. Other owners are Bangor Hydro-Electric, with7%; Maine Public Service Co. and Public Service Co. of NewHampshire, each with 5%; Cambridge Electric Light Co. andEastern Utilities Associates, each with 4%; and CentralVermont Public Service Corp., which has 2%.   Witnesses couldn't see much wrong yesterday from outsidethe plant. James Clarke, housemaster at the Deck House, aprivate school above the plant, said &quot;it looked like justanother normal day, except that there was more steam thanusual&quot; coming from plant cooling vents. On Monday night,though, &quot;there were so many {fire truck} sirens it sounded asif all of southern Maine was burning down,&quot; he said.   Public warning sirens -- required by federal law within a10-mile evacuation zone around nuclear power plants --weren't needed and weren't activated, local and federalofficials said.   Plant opponents said the shutdown was the plant's ninth inthe past year. &quot;This is an old, increasingly unreliable plantshowing its age,&quot; said Robert Moldaver, executive director ofthe Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee. The group has triedthree times in the past decade to shut the plant down byballot initiatives. The latest vote, in 1987, failed by 59%to 41%.   Maine Yankee has a generating capacity of 800,000kilowatts and provides about 25% of Maine's electric powerneeds. It has had one of the better safety records among theU.S.'s 111 nuclear power plants.   Public Citizen's Mr. Bossong said that a study of NRC datareleased last week showed that Maine Yankee &quot;had asubstantially better-than-average safety record&quot; in 1989-90.   Maine Yankee's president, Charles Frizzle, said the firewas &quot;probably the most serious event&quot; at the plant in its19-year life. The fire damaged the main transformer andelectrical conductors and wires leading from the generator tothe transformer and may have damaged the generator itself.The fire was centered in the plant's turbine hall, a largebuilding about 120 feet from the reactor, where the steamheated by the reactor is converted to power. Multiplebarriers, including a 4 1/2-foot-thick steel-lined wall,separate the reactor from the turbine hall and are designedto prevent a radioactive release in case of an accident.   State Rep. Maria Holt, a Democrat who represents fivenearby towns in the Maine Legislature, said she detected norelease of radiation on a monitoring device she has on awindowsill in her home. &quot;We were lucky this time,&quot; she said.</TEXT></DOC>
