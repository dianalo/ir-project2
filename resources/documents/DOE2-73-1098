<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-73-1098 </DOCNO><TEXT>A Monte Carlo simulation method is presented that can, to an accuracyof a few percent, calculate the effects of a dusty coma on the totalenergy input to the cometary nucleus. This method treats nonconservativenonisotropic scattering, as well as the reflection from the nucleus surface.Results are presented as a function of the optical thickness of the dustcolumn in the sun-comet axis. The total energy input to the nucleus appearsto be only weakly dependent on the opacity of the coma, the radial distributionof the dust, or the details of the extinction processes. 18 references.</TEXT></DOC>
