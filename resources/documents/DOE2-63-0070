Obtaining magnetic fieldsgreater than about 18 T at the coil in a large superconducting magnetsystem will require advances in many areas of magnet technology. Theseneeds are discussed and potential solutions (advanced superconductors,structural materials and design methods) evaluated. A point design fora commercial reactor with magnetic field at the coil of 24 T and fusionpower of 1800 MW is presented. Critical issues and parameters for magnetdesign are identified. 20 refs., 9 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
