(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In an office set in central New Jersey'sfarmland, researchers are drawing blueprints for space communitiesbuilt from moon rock and powered by huge solar satellites.   It may sound like science fiction, but Gregg Maryniak says suchdreams could become reality at the start of the next century.   ``We're trying to change from thinking of space as a void tothinking of it as a font of energy and material resources that makesit a good place for people,'' says Maryniak, executive vicepresident of the Space Studies Institute.   Maryniak and Gerard K. O'Neill, a nuclear physicist and professoremeritus at Princeton University who founded the institute in 1977,are among those driven by the belief that man is rapidly consumingthe Earth's natural resources and making it uninhabitable withpollution and garbage.   They believe new energy sources could be developed in space.   ``I see this kind of activity as one of the few bright rays ofhope in a situation that otherwise appears to be hopeless,''Maryniak said in an interview at the institute, which is housed at aformer rocket engine plant.   Since it's too expensive to carry materials into space,scientists must develop construction materials that are alreadyavailable there, he said. The closest source is the moon.   The private, non-profit institute already has developed threeprototypes of a ``mass driver'' _ a machine used to launchbaseball-size fragments of mined moon rock to a central collectionplace in space. Maryniak describes the collection spot as a``celestial catcher's mitt.''   He says moon rock, composed mainly of oxygen, silicon and metals,can be broken into building materials and fuel using solar energy.   The latest mass driver is a tube 1{-feet wide and 500 feet longthat propels material into space at a rate of 1{ miles per second.   The moon rock could be used to build solar power satellites thatwould collect sunlight, convert it to electricity and beam it toearth.   Such satellites, up to 5 miles long and 1{ miles wide, couldproduce as much electricity as three or four nuclear reactors andprovide all the energy needs of a city the size of New York orChicago, Maryniak says.   Totally self-sufficient space cities could be built withagricultural areas, controlled atmosphere, water supplies andgravitational field. Such cities would house tens of thousands ofpeople and have trees, rivers and birds.   Ivan Bekey, special assistant at the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration's office of exploration in Washington, said theinstitute's projects are possible but probably won't be reality for20 to 40 years.   Maryniak said people will choose to live in space because of theclean environment, greater security and the possibility ofcustomizing cities to fit specific needs.   ``At first ... they are going to be in places where theinhabitants are real pioneers,'' he said. ``The second generation ofpeople will think it's very normal and won't be particularlyinterested in going back to see old Mother Earth.''   Maryniak said the first step probably will be much smaller, andcould come in three years. Plans are under way to send a prospectingcapsule to the moon to determine whether there is ice at the poles.Finding water would be a major breakthrough because it's needed forlife and rocket fuel.   O'Neill worked with NASA in the mid-1970s to study thefeasibility of space colonies, Maryniak said. The space agency alsoconsidered solar generators during the Arab oil embargo, butabandoned them as too costly.   Maryniak said a solar generator can be built from moon rock at afraction of the cost of building one with materials shipped fromEarth.   In December, Maryniak traveled to the Soviet Union and signed anagreement with the Moscow Aviation Institute, the country's leadingaerospace training institution, to perform joint research on theeffects of gravity, energy transmission and a lunar probe.</TEXT></DOC>
