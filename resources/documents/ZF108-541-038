(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Qandamp;A Symantec's Qandamp;A is a full-featured flat-file database manager thatincludes a word processor and an English-language query and reportinginterface.andP;  While the $349 package is forms-based like Professional File,it's more sophisticated and more powerful.andM;Qandamp;A offers the widest variety of field formatting and display options amongflat-file databases.andP;  You can set justification on text and numeric fieldsand restrict field input to a unique value or a specific range (controlled byinternal or external look up tables).andP;  You can implement IF-THEN controls onfield-formatting formulas and utilize a rich set of functions (which areavailable in other parts of the program, including reports).andP;  These includedate, time, financial, mathematical, text and string functions, as well ascontrols that operate only when editing or adding records.andM;Qandamp;A also offers a special &quot;keyword&quot; field type.andP;  You can use this feature tostore keywords in each record and later search for records associated withone or more keywords.andP;  Other search facilities let you retrieve records byexact match or from a range and can even execute phonetic searches.andM;Unique among the other flat-file packages evaluated here is Qandamp;A's IntelligentAssistant, a natural language database interface that lets you use Englishphrases and sentences to query a database, modify forms, find and viewrecords, print reports, and make simple adhoc inquiries.andP;  For instance, youcan type in a request like &quot;Show me a report of last year's sales for theNorthwest division, sorted by salesperson and transaction date.&quot;andP;  Once theIntelligent Assistant understands your database, it can produce such areport.andM;&quot;Understands&quot; is the operative word; the Assistant has a built-in vocabularythat's limited to a specific number of commands as well as the names andcontents of the fields in your database.andP;  For instance, the Assistant wouldnot know &quot;last year's&quot; or &quot;Northwest,&quot; while it could figure out &quot;show,&quot;&quot;report,&quot; &quot;sales,&quot; and &quot;division.&quot;andP;  Fortunately, Qandamp;A provides users with asimple means of teaching the Assistant about a particular database.andP;  With alittle repetition, it can learn what it needs to interpret complex queries.andM;In a way, the Assistant is like a built-in programmer: it may take you timeto tell it what you want, but the rewards will compensate for the time spent.andO;Once you're through, those who are less computer-literate will be able totake even greater advantage of the Assistant's abilities, particularly if Qandamp;Ais installed on a network.andM;Qandamp;A offers the finest network support of all the flat-file packages, and theprogram includes full file- and record-locking facilities.andP;  Each record isautomatically locked by the first person to display it; if you try to modifya record already being edited elsewhere, Qandamp;A will notify you and provide thenetwork ID of the other user.andP;  Once the other user has finished, you can makechanges to the newly modified record.andM;WORD PROCESSINGandM;Although Symantec's Qandamp;A Write is sold as a standalone word processor, it'salso integrated as a part of Qandamp;A.andP;  Qandamp;A Write includes a spell checker andmail-merging to produce letters and labels from Qandamp;A databases.andP;  With printersupport for a variety of LaserJet fonts and PostScript, it also lets youinsert bitmaps, .PIC files, and Lotus 1-2-3 files into documents.andM;Qandamp;A offers sophisticated keyboard macros, and they automate routine taskswell enough for you to use them as a programming language.andP;  With the Qandamp;Amacros you can reconfigure the keyboard (including function-key assignmentsthat are used by the Qandamp;A program itself), and you can edit the macros withQandamp;A Write.andP;  In addition, the macros can accept variable input so they can beused with data entry fields.andM;It was suprising to find that Qandamp;A's performance was, at best, mediocre.andP;  Itsfile import times were the slowest of the products tested, and its fileextract, global change and report times were mostly in fourth or fifth place.andO;Qandamp;A's file searches were a little better, but only the sort times wereconsistently respectable--primarily since the file sorts used are temporaryand not saved.andM;Qandamp;A hasn't changed a great deal in the last two years, and a new versionwithout the ancient layers of menus and forms would be welcome; the oldinterface is overdue for an overhaul.andP;  But considering the features that arepacked into this product, at $349 it's worth the extra $50 over ProfessionalFile if a forms-based package is your preference.andM;Richard Hale Shaw is a contributing editor of PC Magazine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
