Associated Newspapers Group Ltd., which publishes the Daily Mail and other British newspapers, said it made an offer last week and remains interested in Today. News International PLC, the British arm of the publisher Rupert Murdoch, also is interested, publishing-industry executives said. News International couldn't be reached for comment.    The Lonrho spokesman declined comment on a report that Mr. Murdoch had made another offer for the paper following Mr. Maxwell's withdrawal yesterday. The three publishers' interest indicated the paper must be &quot;a fairly good asset,&quot; the spokesman continued. &quot;There is an irresistible price for Today, but if we don't get that price we'd prefer to go on&quot; with the paper, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
