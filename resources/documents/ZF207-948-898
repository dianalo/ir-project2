 Of people sitting in outdoor restaurants, drinking beerand eating Sauer-braten.andP;  During these days of progress, can one afford tohold on to naive and stereo-typical perceptions?andM;There was a time, not long ago, when the U.S.andP;  was so far ahead of everybodyelse that news coverage of international software consisted almostexclusively of stories about IBM and what it had done or said.andP;  These days,others are catching up.andM;&quot;Die U.S.andP;  ist das Mutterland der Datenverarbeitung&quot; (The U.S.andP;  is themotherland of data processing), said Ingeborg Mergard, co-founder of Handamp;MSoftware, headquartered near Frankfurt.andP;  &quot;And,&quot; she continued, &quot;IBM hasturned data processing into a commercial entity.andP;  Who, today, can livewithout it?&quot;andM;In the early '70s, numerous IBM-trained Germans left their companies to starttheir own businesses.andP;  Many of them became consultants to other Germancompanies, relying on their IBM experience and their electrical engineeringor math degrees.andM;German schools, at this time, did not offer higher computer science programs.andO;Nevertheless, IBM-trained German engineers entered the software field,analyzed problems and then suggested and implemented software solutions.andP;  Itwas the beginning of a fruitful period in which future software giants wereborn.andM;In 1972, four former IBM engineers got together and started SAP GmbH tomarket an application software system.andP;  A humble beginning turned into askyrocketing business.andM;In 1988, SAP GmbH, headquartered in Walldorf Baden, West Germany, realizedthe highest revenues within the German domestic software market withapproximately $95 million in fiscal 1988 sales, according to theInternational Data Corp., Framingham, Mass.andM;&quot;SAP began when a British company requested our founders to write a softwaresolution,&quot; said Hans Schlegel, president of SAP International, Biel,Switzerland.andP;  &quot;Since then, we've become strong in logistic and financialsystems.&quot;andM;SAP's prime product is the R/2 System.andP;  It includes nine fully integratedapplication modules and the SAP Basic System, which offers interfaces to theexternal databases and communication systems.andM;R/2 functions as a real-time online system so that it can be easily adaptedto any business without changing its basic structure.andP;  The system includessuch modules as financial accounting, materials management, productionplanning and control, plant maintenance, invoicing, and personneladministration and payroll accounting.andM;The ultimate benefit of the SAP R/2 system is that once information isentered, it is instantly and simultaneously available for all applications.andO;The R/2 system runs on IBM and Siemens mainframes.andM;&quot;Portability and standardization are two key words at SAP,&quot; said Schlegel.andO;&quot;The basic systems are the same all over the world, but laws, taxes,languages and currencies differ from country to country.andP;  We haveincorporated all these differences in R/2.&quot;andM;SAP documentation is written in English, but the online Help facility iswritten in numerous different languages.andP;  &quot;We employ 43 translators,&quot; saidHeinz Roggenkemper, president of SAP America, Essington, Pa.andP;  &quot;Differentlanguages are not barriers in information technology.andM;&quot;Also, traditional computer science is generally taught in Germanuniversities in mathematics and physics.andP;  Before attempting to go intoscience, German students must first learn English, because 50% of our sciencetext books were printed in the U.S., Roggenkemper said.andM;SAP's staff count experienced an increase of 500 new employees in 1988.andP;  Manyof the new people went into product development, technical support, trainingand into new subsidiaries which SAP opened worldwide.andM;&quot;SAP has grown tremendously in 1988,&quot; said Schlegel, &quot;not through acquisitionbut through new hires.&quot;andP;  Currently, SAP engages about 1,300 employeesworldwide.andM;SOFTWARE AG HAS GLOBAL PRESENCEandM;Although SAP's position is strong in Germany's domestic market, from a globalstandpoint, Software AG is by far the largest German software house.andO;Software AG's 1988 worldwide revenues reached as high as $230 million.andM;Software AG (SAG) was founded in 1969 in Darmstadt when a few Germansconceived the idea to develop an adaptable, all-purpose database managementsystem.andP;  Peter Schnell, president and chairman of the board, was co-developerof Adabas.andP;  The first version of the Adabas database management system wasimplemented in 1971.andM;Both Adabas for the IBM world and Adabas (VMS) for the DEC VAX environmentare inverted indexed systems.andP;  The inverted index technology employed thedata relationship concept long before the relational technology, as we knowit today, was formalized.andM;Adabas separates data from instructions and stores it in compressed storage,thereby saving disk space and enhancing performance speed.andP;  The same conceptwas employed by IBM not too long ago in IBM's largest MVS/ESA operatingsystem.andM;Adabas, which today has about 3,000 users, created the technical productbasis for SAG's success.andP;  The DBMS was followed by Natural, one of the veryfirst non-procedural development languages.andP;  Peter Page began to developNatural in 1976, but today, it is no longer the simple applicationdevelopment tool that was introduced in 1979.andM;&quot;We are a company with history,&quot; said Page, SAG's chief operating officer.andO;&quot;But when you look at Software AG today, it is quite different from the daywe started.andP;  We have grown tremendously and our products have evolved as ourcustomers required a much broader spectrum of functions.&quot;andM;Today's Natural represents a family of 4GL tools for IBM and Siemensmainframes and Digital Equipment Corp. VAX minicomputer applicationdevelopment.andP;  Consistent with SAG's open integrated software architecture,Natural also incorporates the Predict online dictionary, interactivecommunications capabilities and the Natural Optimizer compiler.andM;&quot;The number of our staff members has substantially increased, especially inthe customer application solution area,&quot; said Page.andP;  SAG, today, has apresence in 55 countries and its worldwide staff grew from 2,700 to 3,000 in1988.andM;The German software market consists of software manufacturers such as SAG andSAP, software distributors, consultants and hardware companies that developand market their own software.andP;  Some German companies develop and markettheir own software as well as distribute U.S.andP;  software.andM;Handamp;M Software, Roedermark, W. Germany, develops and markets its own softwarebut also distributes American software in Germany.andM;Formed in 1972, Handamp;M began by customizing systems for its clients who wereutilizing IBM's CICS teleprocessing monitor.andP;  Today, Handamp;M has numerous officeautomation-oriented software packages for the IBM mainframe market.andM;&quot;All our products and their documentation are multilingual,&quot; said Mergard.andO;&quot;They also conform to both European and American standards for date, decimalpoint and comma.&quot;andM;Perhaps the best known Handamp;M product in the U.S.andP;  is Keyfast, an online dataentry system that also provides its users with personal computingcapabilities.andP;  Keyfast has edit rules and checks that make data entry easierfor less experienced clerks not familiar with formatting and entering rawdata.andM;Other Handamp;M products--all of which can be integrated--include securitypackages, online word processing, electronic mail/calendaring, an electronicspreadsheet, a data dictionary, and other office automation products.andP;  Handamp;Malso markets a CICS transmission optimizer that reduces out- and inbound datastreams.andM;Among American software companies interested in the German market areComputer Associate International Inc., Garden City, N.Y., which opened itsown office in Germany; and Boole andamp; Babbage, Sunnyvale, Calif., whichdistributes its software through a wholly owned subsidiary by the name of TheEuropean Software Company (Tesc).andM;&quot;Compared to the other European countries, Germany has perhaps the mostlucrative software market,&quot; said Edouard Williamson, president of Tesc.andP;  &quot;Andwhen one speaks of Germany, one must, of course, also include the otherGerman-speaking countries, such as Austria and Switzerland.&quot;andM;German data centers are the most progressive of all European countries,according to Williamson.andP;  &quot;France is more service-oriented, and Germany ismore product-oriented,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;German software users look for the lateston the market.&quot;andM;DOMESTIC SYSTEM SOFTWARE SPARSEandM;Performance is a big issue in Germany.andP;  The 1988 Computer Measurement Group(CMG) meeting held in Garmish-Partenkirchen drew attendees from all overGermany.andP;  The performance management and tuning IMS systems sessions wereespecially well-attended.andM;While numerous smaller German software houses mushroom all over the country,there is a lack of German-developed systems software.andM;&quot;I am not aware of a company in Germany that develops software such as ours,&quot;said Carole Kaplan, Boole andamp; Babbage director of corporate communications.andO;&quot;Forty-nine percent of our revenue came from Europe and a large part of itcame from Germany.&quot;andM;The sole business of the German ISP Software, headquartered in Karlsruhe, isto distribute and support U.S.-made systems software.andM;&quot;We have many qualified software companies in Germany but not in mainframesystems software,&quot; said Karsten Philipp, a 15-year veteran in tape and diskmanagement software, and president of ISP.andP;  &quot;We won't buy a car from theU.S., but we'll purchase our systems software there.&quot;andP;  According to ISP'sestimates, there are approximately 4,000 mainframes in German-speakingEurope, and the number is rising yearly--a fertile ground for the softwareindustry, indeed.andM;Germany's workforce is gearing more toward lucrative careers in dataprocessing.andP;  For instance, an entry-level systems programmer earns about$2,500 per month, and a senior systems programmer earns about $5,000 permonth.andP;  Not bad, if one considers that German employees get 14 paychecks peryear and six weeks vacation per year.andM;But Americans going to Germany to get rich may be disappointed.andP;  The livingcosts in Germany are high.andM;American companies setting up shop there may find the overhead they have topay on taxes and social costs prohibitive.andP;  The income tax, state tax andchurch tax can amount to as much as 75%, according to ISP's Philipp.andM;Looking into the crystal ball, one can see Germany--like all other worldforces--struggle for global position and strategic alliances that may reshapethe worldwide computer industry.andM;In an attempt to confront the American software industry and diminish itssupremacy in global market share, the European software industry--made up ofhardware and software companies, university Randamp;D labs, as well as governmentagencies--banded together and formed multinational &quot;group projects.&quot;andP;  Onesuch project is the Eureka Software Factory (ESF).andM;&quot;EUREKA&quot; PARTNERSandM;The German ESF partners include AEG, Nixdorf Computer AG, Softlab and theUniversitat Dortmund.andP;  French partners are Cap Gemini Sogeti, Matra, SemaMetra and the Randamp;D institute Inria.andM;Britain's ICL, Sweden's LM Ericsson and Telelogic, and Norway's Norsk Dataand Center for Industrial Research make up the rest of the ESF group.andM;&quot;We cannot transfer the tools of yesterday to the systems of tomorrow,&quot; saidthe ESF project chief at AEG-owned GEI Rechnersysteme GmbH in Aachen.andM;ESF wants software throughout Europe to be developed according to ESF-definedindustrial standards, and partners plan to employ 250 professionals at a costof $360 million to erect a software factory by the mid-'90s.andP;  Headquarterswill be in West Berlin.andM;While Nixdorf is heavily involved with the ESF project, the largest Germanhardware giant, Siemens Aktiengesellschaft, is getting involved with a groupproject, brought to life by the European Commission, namely the EuropeanSoftware and Systems Initiative (ESSI).andP;  Other ESSI partners are Bull, ICLand Olivetti, as well as software houses and national institutes such as GMD,Inria, and NCC.andM;&quot;The goal of ESSI is to bridge the gap between the state of the art and thestate of practice in systems and software engineering,&quot; said RudolfSteinmetz, corporate communications officer at Siemens in Munich.andM;&quot;ESSI's theme is 'technology transfer' and the emphasis is not on, as withEureka, development of new tools and methods.andP;  Instead, ESSI aims to advanceexisting tools and methods and hopes to accomplish this through analysis,through technical demonstrations and higher education of data processingprofessionals,&quot; Steinmetz said.andM;Who will win the fight over global standards?andP;  America?andP;  Europe?andP;  The FarEast?andM;Perhaps Charles R. Morris, in his article &quot;The Coming Global Boom,&quot; publishedby The Atlantic Monthly, is right when he predicts, &quot;America will become ahaven for high-productivity manufacturing.andP;  American companies will be clearwinners in some global industries, and American companies that have taken toheart the lessons of the past 10 years will be winners in every industry.andM;&quot;To be sure, a large number won't make the grade and will be swallowed up bystronger Asian or European competitors,&quot; he continues, &quot;but it will beincreasingly difficult for consumers or workers to tell the difference.&quot;andM;Who will own how much of whom and what, in which country?andM;Harding is freelance journalist and director of marketing and communicationsat a software firm that is not mentioned in the story.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
