Violators would be fined as much as 10% of their annual turnover, it said.    Computer-reservation systems are used by airlines to check information about their own flights and those of other airlines participating in that system.    The two biggest in Europe are the Amadeus and Galileo systems in which European and U.S. carriers participate.    Last month, British Airways PLC and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines settled a dispute over their computer-reservation systems. The settlement helps American's effort to sell its computer-reservation system to British travel agents and clears the way for British Airways to take a stake in a U.S. reservations system developed by UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.    A commission statement said about two-thirds of all European airline bookings are made through airline-owned systems, and there's &quot;always a temptation for these companies to build into their systems a bias in their own favor . . . through screen presentation, speed of access or quality of the information given.    &quot;It is also possible to deny access to the system for new would-be subscribers or to charge prohibitive fees.&quot;    The commission's code of conduct specifies how flight and other information must be displayed and bans exclusive terms of membership. It applies to all systems whether based inside or outside EC member states.    Separately, the commission issued competition rules to cover airline agreements on flight scheduling, capacity coordination, fares, revenue pooling, allocation of airport space and ground services, among others. </TEXT></DOC>
