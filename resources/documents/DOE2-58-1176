The results obtained indicate that the effect ofiodine on the radiolysis products in the systems with and without uraniumsalt is similar. It was also found that the effect of iodine on the retentionof uranium and zirconium in organic phase depended on nitric acid concentrationand was particularly high in the systems with low concentrations of HNO/sub3/ containing uranium salt.
