The revisions, the result of a congressionally mandated two-year review of preferentially treated imports from Third World countries, will reduce the volume of imports eligible for duty-free status by an estimated $2 billion, or almost 23%, for advanced developing countries such as Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico.    At the same time, on orders from Congress, the U.S. for the first time canceled all duty-free trade preferences for three countries -- Romania, Nicaragua and Paraguay -- found to be violating worker-rights standards.    The U.S. also served notice it would continue to monitor workers' rights policies in Chile to see whether the Pinochet regime should be cut off too. Washington already has abstained on World Bank loans to Chile to protest the country's human rights violations. Those loans eventually were approved.    But U.S. officials said that the actual loss of export earnings for the countries involved is likely to be minuscule. Losing duty-free status isn't likely to hurt much because the U.S. already has relatively low tariffs for most products. And in many cases the developing countries can offset the tariff boosts by cost-cutting or can find other markets, they said.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the U.S. action &quot;shouldn't have a significant impact&quot; on debtor countries such as Brazil &quot;because the magnitudes (of resulting tariff increases) aren't great.&quot;    Congress has been pressing the administration to trim the number of duty-free imports. Many lawmakers contend that newly industrializing countries such as Brazil, which have become increasingly competitive with U.S. producers in recent years, no longer should be granted special preferences reserved for poorer countries. And in 1984, labor unions successfully prodded the two houses to deny benefits to countries found to be inhibiting worker rights.    U.S. officials said Romania, Nicaragua and Paraguay have been impeding their workers' right to organize and bargain with employers and to associate freely with other political groups. The revisions announced on Friday will affect about $140 million of products from Romania, mainly chemicals and furniture, and about $6 million a year in imports from Paraguay. Trade from Nicaragua won't be affected at all because the U.S. already has embargoed all imports from that country.    The reductions affecting advanced developing countries will reduce the value of eligible products from Taiwan by $1.2 billion, or 37.5%; South Korea by $400 million, or 24%; Brazil, $420 million, or 32%; and Mexico, $200 million, or 16%. At the same time, the value of eligible products will rise by $40 million, or 3%, for Hong Kong, and by $81 million, or 12% for Singapore -- mainly as a reward for reducing barriers to U.S. goods.    The U.S. began the duty-free program, known as the Generalized System of Preferences, in 1976 as part of an effort by several large industrialized countries to help developing countries boost exports. The program now provides duty-free status to $13 billion of products from 140 countries, less than 4% of all U.S. imports.    Separately, Rep. Jim Wright of Texas, the next House Speaker, called for a bipartisan meeting on Jan. 21 of congressmen, administration officials and industry and labor representatives to discuss how the U.S. can reverse its enormous trade deficit.    &quot;Action is long overdue,&quot; he said. &quot;For two years the U.S. has temporized, alibied, procrastinated, tinkered with the currency, even tried to pretend the problem does not exist.&quot;    The Democratic leader reiterated that the &quot;first imperative&quot; of the new Congress will be to enact legislation intended to curb the trade deficit and arrest the decline in American competitiveness. </TEXT></DOC>
