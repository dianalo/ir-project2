(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court today cleared theway for the Internal Revenue Service to revoke the PTL televisionministry's tax-exempt status.   The IRS wants to revoke PTL's exempt status in part because PTLhad used contributions to fund the lavish lifestyles of Jim Bakkerand his wife Tammy, said IRS lawyer Francis Allegra.   Officials of the ministry Bakker founded had argued that loss oftax-exempt status could scuttle efforts to reorganize the ministryby a federal bankruptcy court's May 1 deadline.   Bakker resigned from PTL after a scandal over a sexual encounterwith former church secretary Jessica Hahn.   Attorneys for the IRS, seeking to make the revocationretroactive to May 31, 1981, said PTL owes the government from $55million to $82 million in back taxes.   Today's unanimous ruling from a three-judge panel of the 4thU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a decision by U.S. DistrictJudge Karen L. Henderson of Columbia, S.C..   Henderson had found that the bankruptcy court handling the PTLreorganization did not have the authority to prevent the IRS fromlifting the ministry's tax-exempt status.   ``Although a revocation may potentially obstruct the orderlyadministration in bankruptcy, we decline to create and exception... in the absence of expressed congressional intent,'' the panelsaid.   R. Bradford Leggett, a PTL attorney, had argued before theappeals panel on March 31 that loss of tax-exempt status wouldjeopardize the ministry's ability to reorganize by the bankruptcycourt's May 1 deadline.   The ministry, based in Fort Mill, S.C., is engaged in a ``Marchto Victory'' telethon to raise $4.2 million by May 1. PTL has debtsestimated at $60 million.</TEXT></DOC>
