Two insurgent leaders criticized the Soviet Union for consideringa role in a future Afghan government for former King Zahir Shah, whowas overthrown in 1973 and lives in Italy.   Iran said Yuri Vorontsov, the Soviet deputy foreign minister,arrived in Tehran for talks with Afghan insurgent leaders based inIran. He met in Saudi Arabia last month with Burhanuddin Rabbani,leader of a seven-faction alliance based in Pakistan.   At least 5.5 million Afghans have fled their country during adecade of civil war, nearly all of them to Pakistan or Iran, Moslemnations that are Afghanistan's neighbors on the east and west.   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in April1978 and Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December1979. An estimated 115,000 were there when a U.N.-mediatedwithdrawal agreement was signed April 14, 1988.   Red Army soldiers started leaving May 15 and U.N. officials saidhalf were gone by Aug. 15. All are to be out by Feb. 15.   The insurgents, supported by the United States and Pakistan, havedemanded an Islamic government after the Soviets leave and aretrying to overthrow the regime of President Najib.   Najib announced the cease-fire Friday, effective New Year's Day,and said government forces would not fire unless fired upon.   Insurgent leaders believe Najib's government will fall when theSoviets are gone and rejected the truce because, they said, it wouldbe a disadvantage to them at this stage.   State radio in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, said Monday thatinsurgents attacked Kandahar in the southeast, killing threecivilians and wounding six.   It said 31 guerrillas were killed and 27 wounded in an ensuingbattle with security forces.   Kabul radio, monitored in Islamabad, said the guerrillas fired onresidential areas of Paktia, near the Pakistani border, and securityforces returned the fire, killing 17 insurgents.   Two more battles, in which 23 guerrillas were slain, occurred atJalalabad and Gushta in Nangarahar province, the radio claimed. Itdid not mention government casualties and there was no independentconfirmation of its reports.   In Islamabad, insurgent leaders Rabbani and Gulbadin Hekmatyarcriticized the Soviets for overtures to the former king. Vorontsov,who also is Moscow's ambassador to Kabul, met with Zahir Shah inRome on Dec. 24.   ``Zahir Shah will certainly not feel safe in the revolutionaryAfghanistan,'' Rabbani said at a news conference, and Hekmatyardeclared the king ``has no place in today's Afghanistan.''   ``The Afghan people will strongly resist any move againstformation of an Islamic government in Kabul,'' Hekmatyar said.</TEXT></DOC>
