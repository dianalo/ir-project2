Northwest lawmakers, fishing groups and environmentalists, whohave been critical of the pact, praised Mosbacher's decision andurged U.S. officials to adopt a ``tougher stance'' in future talks.   Japanese officials previously told the State Department theagreement was only a take-it-or-leave-it basis and said they wouldbe unwilling to reopen negotiations.   Japan, along with South Korea and Taiwan, faces possible tradesanctions on fishery products exported to the United States ifdriftnet agreements are not signed by June 29.   An estimated 700 to 1,000 fishing vessels from Japan, SouthKorea and Taiwan use driftnets in the north Pacific, ostensibly tocatch squid.   The monofilament, small-mesh nets, which can stretch more than30 miles long, hang in the water and snare virtually any mammal,bird or fish which comes in contact. The nets can cover more than30,000 miles of ocean in a day.   Mosbacher believes the treaty calls for too few observers onJapanese driftnet vessels and not enough patrol vessels in thelegal driftnet zone in the north Pacific to ensure compliance, saidRanjit de Silva, a Commerce Department spokesman.   De Silva also said Mosbacher is concerned over the Japaneserejection of a proposal to place transponders on their vessels sotheir locations could be tracked by satellite.   ``The secretary is not satisfied with it (the agreement) andwants the State Department to renegotiate, focusing on thesepoints,'' said de Silva.   Mosbacher has the authority to decide whether the agreementssatisfy the monitoring and enforcement provisions of the DriftnetAct passed by Congress in 1987.   U.S. fishermen insist the driftnet fleets are intentionallycatching salmon under the guise of harvesting squid, and they saysalmon runs in Alaska, Washington and Oregon have dropped sharplyas a result.   Environmentalists charge driftnets are responsible for thedeaths of thousands of porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marinelife each year.   The tentative treaty with Japan would allow 32 observers to beplaced aboard the estimated 460 Japanese vessels using driftnetsand would increase from four to five the number of Japanese patrolboats in the vast area where squid fishing is allowed.   The Japanese also indicated they were unilaterally expanding thelegal driftnet fish zone 120 miles north.   ``This is the outcome we've been working for,'' Sen. FrankMurkowski, R-Alaska, said of Mosbacher's decision.   Murkowski said he wants Secretary of State James A. Baker III toappoint a ``tough, special negotiator who will make sure the U.S.point of view is represented strongly and effectively.''   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., said Baker should reopen talks atthe ``highest level'' and a new treaty should increase the numberof observers and patrol boats and require transponders on Japanesevessels.   Dem Cowles, a spokesman for the United Fishermen of Alaska, saidthe tentative agreement was the ``absolute wrong message to send tothe Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese fishermen who are actinglike pirates out there.''   Cowles' group represents 18,000 fishermen from Alaska,Washington state, Oregon and California.</TEXT></DOC>
