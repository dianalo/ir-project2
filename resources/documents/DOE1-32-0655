Sixty four 90W low voltage sodium lamps were mounted in Meotoura Tunnel of Nichinan- Arai Line, Miyazaki Prefecture. The tunnel is 121 m long and 6 m wide.For the solar cell array capacity, the lighting load was set on 15.6kWp, and the control load on 2.3 kWp. The lighting was done at 200 Vd.c. power. The array d.c. output was high frequency converted throughan inverter in the most part for lighting, while a part of the outputwas stored in the electric batteries. A 69.4 kWh electric battery wasinstalled for load-managing the power supply, and maintaining the nightpower. In consideration of the solar electric energy and the batterycapacity, a new light-controlling system was developed. By the system,the road-surface illuminance and the number of sodium lamps were controlledin consideration of the solar electric energy and the battery capacity,so that the illuminance in the tunnel corresponds to that out of thetunnel. Economical design of the solar cell array and the battery systemis realized. Setting of the tunnel illumination system was completedin March, 1986. (1 fig)</TEXT></DOC>
