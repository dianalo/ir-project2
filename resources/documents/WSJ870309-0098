Because the New York Public Service Commission has a cap on how much of Nine Mile 2's costs may be passed on to ratepayers, that additional cost will fall totally on investors in the plant's five utility owners. They are Niagara Mohawk, which owns 41%, New York State Electric andamp; Gas Corp. (18%), Long Island Lighting Co. (18%), Rochester Gas andamp; Electric Corp. (14%) and Central Hudson Gas andamp; Electric Corp. (9%).    Syracuse, N.Y.-based Niagara Mohawk said a prototype safety valve similar to those in the plant failed the fourth in a series of leak-rate tests. As previously reported, the valves leak water faster than permitted by Nuclear Regulatory Commission rules. The problem lies in the ropelike packing between the valves metal parts, the utility has said.    A Niagara Mohawk spokesman said a final decision on whether to replace the valves would be made this week. However, he didn't sound optimistic that the packing could be satisfactorily reconfigured, and utility analysts said they now expect the valves to be replaced.    &quot;It sounds like they're stalling about making the announcement&quot; that the valves must be replaced, said Daniel F. Scotto, utility-bond analyst at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc.    For the plant to go into commercial operation this September, as currently scheduled, the reactor would have to have been operating by about Feb. 16 at a rate sufficient to produce steam. Analysts said they now think the plant will probably go into operation about next January.    Given that each month's delay adds about $60 million to the cost of the facility, the four-month delay would tack $240 million or so onto the plant's current $5.8 billion price tag, analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
