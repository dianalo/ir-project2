Mr. Kinsley points out that the Democratic Party has lost four of the past five presidential elections, but that when one starts counting at an earlier date the record becomes more respectable. This is exactly the point. The New Deal and postwar Democratic Party was broadly supported until Vietnam War activists pushed it suicidally to the left.    Prior to Vietnam, Democratic presidents supported a strong defense against totalitarian threats to freedom. President Roosevelt overcame isolationist sentiment to lead America against Nazi Germany. President Truman, through the Marshall Plan and a large peacetime military, contained the spread of communism in Europe. President Kennedy spoke about a missile gap with the Soviet Union.    This vision of America as the leader of the free world is utterly lacking in any of the announced Democratic presidential candidates. Many of us hoped that Sens. Sam Nunn or Bill Bradley would enter the campaign because we saw in their voting records a commitment to this kind of vision. These candidates could appeal to the millions of people who voted Democratic in House, state and local elections but deserted the party in droves to vote for President Reagan.    Finally, Mr. Kinsley's inference that those who seek to return the party to its New Deal and postwar roots, including a strong defense and foreign policy, are somehow not real Democrats reflects the intolerance of the left for any Democrat who challenges its ideas. This intolerance has silenced the voices of moderation within the party. What the party desperately needs is a presidential candidate with the courage to put forth a vision of America as the leader of the free world, within the Democratic tradition, and around whom traditional Democrats can rally.
