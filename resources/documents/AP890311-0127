Mike Madden, 27, of North Pole, was rescued by a militaryhelicopter at about 9:30 a.m., eight hours after fellow musher JerryAustin told race officials that Madden needed help, members of therace board said.   Madden was 30 miles east of the checkpoint at Iditarod, whichmarks the half-way point of the 1,168 mile race. Race officials saidMadden's condition stabilized after he was flown to McGrath en routeto an Anchorage hospital.   The National Weather Service in Anchorage said the lowtemperature in Iditarod early Saturday was probably about 5 degrees.   An HH-3 ``Jolly Green Giant'' helicopter from Elmendorf Air ForceBase flew a doctor, accompanied by Austin, to help Madden, who alsowas reported to have injured his knee while chopping dogfood earlierin the race.   Austin intended to take care of Madden's dogs after theevacuation, said Leo Rasmussen, president of the Iditarod board. Thedetour was a setback for Austin, who has already been hampered bysick dogs.   ``It destroys his chances for a top 20 finish, and will probablymake him one of the last teams to come into Nome,'' race boardmember Tom Busch said. Busch added that three rookie mushers whostayed with Madden while Austin was fetching help probably ruinedtheir chances for the Rookie of the Year award.   Madden, a carpenter, moved to Alaska from Billings, Mont., in1983 and began mushing the following year. He was running in theIditarod for the first time.   Veteran musher Martin Buser led the Anchorage-to-Nome race on itseighth day. Buser, 30, left Grayling at 3:34 a.m., about four hoursahead of Susan Butcher and Rick Swenson. Grayline is 497 miles fromthe finish line in Nome.   Butcher has won the last three races and Swenson is a four-timechampion. Buser, who runs a kennel in Big Lake, has never won theIditarod but finished third in last year's race.   With Madden apparently out of the race, the field of contendersfell to 41, the lowest figure since 1985. Forty-nine mushers were inthe lineup when the race began March 4.   Mushers are vying for a $250,000 purse, including $50,000 for thewinner.</TEXT></DOC>
