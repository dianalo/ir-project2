It's just that mandatory testing is the least effective way to do the job.    &quot;The very people you need most to counsel and test are scared away,&quot; he explains. &quot;They feel in jeopardy. They fear job discrimination, housing discrimination, insurance discrimination, social ostracism.&quot;    Public-health officials, civil libertarians, gay-rights organizations and others concerned with the problem have from the very start urged the widest possible voluntary AIDS testing. But the Reagan administration's policy of broader mandatory testing, coupled with its recommendation of &quot;routine&quot; testing in several areas, is causing alarm.    Opponents stress not only the danger of loose record-keeping and subsequent disclosure and discrimination in a mandatory-testing program, but also a likely increase in false results and the inefficient use of funds. Their major argument, however, is that mandatory testing is likely to scare off such high-risk groups as homosexuals and intravenous drug users, who must change their sex and drug habits if the epidemic is to be slowed.    &quot;The administration doesn't seem to understand that, unlike other tests where you can treat people and cure them, there is no treatment for AIDS yet,&quot; declares Ronald Bayer, an associate at the Hastings Center, a bioethical think tank north of New York City. &quot;The critical thing here is to get people to change their behavior to minimize the risk to themselves and others. And for that you need cooperation.&quot;    Officially, where the administration is calling for &quot;routine&quot; testing, people have the right to refuse. But opponents say that as a practical matter, with the suspicion that would automatically attach to a refusal to take the test, &quot;routine&quot; is in fact &quot;mandatory.&quot; (Some administration officials admit that this is what they really have in mind.)    And there are critics who worry that many influential testing advocates actually favor some sort of quarantine for AIDS carriers. On a television panel show last Sunday, Secretary of Education William Bennett suggested that some AIDS-infected prisoners might have to be kept confined even after they finish serving their prison terms. &quot;Somewhere along the line,&quot; added Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.), &quot;we are going to have to quarantine if we are really going to contain this disease.&quot;    Moreover, the opponents say, the administration and others proposing stiff testing haven't thought through all the implications of their plans: What will be done with the information collected? What efforts will be made to notify former sex partners of infected men and women -- and, realistically, how successfully can this be done? How will prison officials go about isolating AIDS-infected prisoners?    &quot;That may be all right for a state with four or five AIDS cases in its prisons,&quot; says Mr. Bayer. &quot;But states like New York and California would have to create two parallel prison systems.&quot;    AIDS testing for marriage-license applicants is likely to involve high expenditures on a very low-risk population, opponents say. &quot;The highest-risk groups aren't the most likely to be coming forward to be married,&quot; observes Katherine McCarter, associate executive director of the American Public Health Association.    Palmer Jones, executive vice president of the New Hampshire Medical Society, estimates that of the 22,000 marriage-license applicants in his state each year, 220 would test positive on the initial screening, based on estimates of local infection rates. But follow-up testing, he says, would show that only two of those were true positives.    The governor of New Hampshire has proposed covering the cost of such testing by charging each applicant a fee of $8 to $10. Given the total paid by the 22,000 applicants, that would work out to a cost of anywhere from $88,000 to $110,000 to detect each of the two AIDS carriers -- and some state officials think that even the governor's fee scale won't cover testing costs.    A hypothetical study by the federal Centers for Disease Control put the cost of finding AIDS carriers in screening 10,000 low-risk individuals at a lower but still significant $18,197 per carrier. Figures like these, the critics claim, prove that widespread testing will cost far more than its advocates admit.    Those who oppose mandatory testing also contend that money used to fund such programs would be better spent to expand voluntary testing and counseling at present AIDS-testing sites, drug and venereal-disease clinics and family-planning clinics. They point out that in many cities there are waiting times of three to six weeks or more for testing at these places, and that many family-planning clinics don't have the AIDS test available at all. (The family-planning clinics are particularly important as a way to reach infected women, or women at risk of infection, before they become pregnant and pass the disease on to their children.)    &quot;We need to put our time and effort into providing for those willing to be tested,&quot; says Ms. McCarter.    Opponents worry deeply about the lack of confidentiality likely in marriage-license bureaus and other places where mandatory-testing programs would be inaugurated. &quot;The administration hasn't coupled its calls for more testing with calls for stricter legislation to protect confidentiality and prohibit discrimination,&quot; notes Nan Hunter, head of the AIDS project at the American Civil Liberties Union.    Many critics of mandatory testing consider counseling and confidentiality all the more important because as testing is expanded, the number of false positives and false negatives will inevitably increase. Both outcomes are worrisome.    A person testing falsely positive not only goes through needless anxiety and family strain but could face job loss and all the other forms of discrimination confronting those truly infected. And persons testing falsely negative may display what Ms. Hunter calls the &quot;disinhibition factor&quot; -- a feeling they can afford to continue risky sexual or drug behavior.    This is especially dangerous because some false negatives may be due to the fact that while antibodies usually show up in six to eight weeks, they can take as long as six months. Thus, someone tested soon after exposure may show negative but then develop an infection. (This raises the possibility that repeated testing at six-month intervals may ultimately be proposed.)    Critics of mandatory testing concede the need to get far more information on the spread of AIDS, but they see no reason why researchers and public-health officials can't get the data they require from anonymous testing. Some of this is already being done, in fact. The CDC, for example, has several hospitals routinely testing blood samples collected anonymously from patients as part of regular diagnostic testing, and it is slowly expanding this network.    If AZT proves successful in its current tests on healthy but infected gay men, or if some other form of effective early-stage treatment is found, the balance of self-interest could tip toward testing. A number of other developments might also make routine testing more attractive, some critics concede: tight supervision of new laboratories, tougher confidentiality laws and anti-discrimination legislation. &quot;But at the present time,&quot; Dr. Fineberg says, &quot;given where all these things are, mandatory testing is quite wrong-minded.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Advocates See Need to Track Disease's Spread&quot; -- WSJ June 18, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
