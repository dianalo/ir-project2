Kollmorgen, which makes specialty motors and electronic products, said it expects to report net of between 33 cents and 38 cents a share compared with $240,000, or two cents a share, a year earlier.    The company has about 10.4 million common shares outstanding.    Kollmorgen said the $5 million gain reflected an amendment to a licensing agreement with Hitachi Chemical Co., Tokyo, covering the manufacture and sale of certain wiring technology. Balance of the proceeds will be reflected as royalties during the remainder of 1988.    In 1987, net was $285,000, or three cents a share, including a $500,000 gain from the sale of a building, compared with a loss of $19.9 million in 1986. Sales fell to $301 million from $319.2 million in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
