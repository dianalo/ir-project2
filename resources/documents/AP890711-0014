Victor Stello Jr. lacks commitment to improving safety at thedecrepit weapons facilities, Greenpeace and other environmentalgroups said Monday.   Stello's selection runs counter to Bush's professed desire torestore public confidence in the weapons complex by tighteningenvironmental controls and strengthening safety rules, Greenpeacesaid.   ``Stello embodies the very attitudes that have brought theDepartment of Energy where it is today, to a crashing halt,'' saidStephen Schwartz, a Greenpeace spokesman. ``Putting Victor Stello incharge of nuclear weapons production is like putting the Joker incharge of Gotham City.''   Greenpeace said several other citizen groups, including theEnvironmental Policy Institute and the Union of ConcernedScientists, are joining in a letter-writing campaign to try to blockStello's confirmation by the Senate Armed Services Committee.   NRC spokesman Joseph Fouchard said Stello had not seen theGreenpeace announcement but was ``not commenting on things of thiskind.''   Bush said last month he will nominate Stello as assistant energysecretary for defense programs. No Senate hearing has yet beenscheduled.   Stello, 54, is a nuclear engineer who joined the Atomic EnergyCommission, the predecessor of both the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission and the Energy Department, in 1966. He currently is theNRC's executive director for operations, in effect the official mostdirectly responsible for safety in commercial nuclear plants.   Stello's critics accuse him of siding with utilities in NRCdisputes over compliance with commission rules, and say he hasthwarted investigations by his own agency into rules violations.   Greenpeace said it had requested a meeting with Energy SecretaryJames D. Watkins to discuss the Stello selection. Watkins told anews conference June 27 that Stello has the experience and desire torun the nuclear weapons program, even ``if he's a B student to manypeople and he has some chinks in his armor.''   Will Callicott, a department spokesman, said Monday that Stellostill has Watkins' ``full support.''   Watkins, meanwhile, announced that George H. Miller of theLawrence Livermore National Laboratory will become his specialscientific adviser on weapons. Watkins had said earlier he plannedto hire an expert in weapons research and production to offsetStello's lack of experience in military applications of atomic power.   Stello would replace Troy E. Wade II, who has held the positionon an interim basis since August 1987.   The job of weapons chief has taken on added visibility andpolitical sensitivity since the program encountered a series oftechnical and management setbacks last year that, for the firsttime, halted the nation's production of nuclear arms materials.Stello's main responsibility would be to get the program runningagain.   Lando Zech, who stepped down as NRC chairman June 30, vigorouslydefended Stello in a farewell news conference, calling him ``anoutstanding public servant.''</TEXT></DOC>
