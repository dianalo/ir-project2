At a report-back rally attended by 30,000 blacks in Sowetoyesterday, ANC leader Nelson Mandela said the meetings went along way toward breaking down suspicion between theparticipants, who have been bitter enemies for the past threedecades. The talks were designed to clear away obstacles toeventual negotiations over ending the racial-segregationsystem known as apartheid and shaping a new constitutionwhere the white minority will share power with the blackmajority.</LP><TEXT>   The government said it will review its existing securitylegislation, including possibly lifting the four-year-oldstate of emergency, while the ANC said it will look &quot;hard andearnestly&quot; at suspending its armed struggle. The two sidesformed a joint working group to hammer out agreement on therelease of political prisoners and immunity for politicaloffenses.   But Mr. Mandela said the government's opposition to aone-man, one-vote majority rule system and its insistencethat the rights of minorities, such as the whites, beconstitutionally protected, &quot;means that white South Africadoesn't yet trust us.&quot; South African President F.W. de Klerk,who earlier this year legalized the ANC after a 30-year banand released Mr. Mandela from prison, says simple majorityrule will lead to black domination and wants to make &quot;groupprotection&quot; a subject for future negotiations.   &quot;At a time when we want to move away from all kinds ofracism we don't want discussions, which have started so well,to be bedeviled by any solutions based on race,&quot; Mr. Mandelatold the crowd. &quot;I'm going to urge Mr. de Klerk that hemustn't bring this {group concept} to any conference betweenthe ANC and the government.&quot;   Rather, Mr. Mandela said, &quot;Our duty, both as black andwhite leaders, is now to go out into the country and talk toour people not in terms of blacks and whites but in terms ofSouth Africans. We have to convince them that any form ofracism is a formula for disaster.&quot;   The talks fulfilled the ANC's dream of sitting down withthe government as equal partners, something it has pushed forsince its inception in 1912.   While the talks were hailed across South Africa, therewere dissenting voices. Former President P.W. Botha said hewouldn't renew his membership in the ruling National Partybecause it earlier lifted the ban on the South AfricanCommunist Party and allowed the communist leader, Joe Slovo,to be part of the ANC's negotiation team.</TEXT></DOC>
