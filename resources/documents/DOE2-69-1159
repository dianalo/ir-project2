An alternative approach, the regionalized electricitymodel (REM) computer code, aggregated generating capacity by fuel type.Changes in projected customer loads during the 1970s and early 1980smarkedly affected utility construction plans: as customer load growthdeclined, utilities deferred or canceled many new generating units andimplemented conservation and load management programs. The current revisionof ERS reflects these changes and provides a basis from which to assessthe effects of further changes in the utility industry. To update the1981 ERS database, the project team drew on several sources to updatethe 1981 ERS database. The team obtained fossil and nuclear steam-generatingunit data from the Utility Data Institute's EEI Power Statistics database.They derived end-use loads from synthesized load-shape data providedby Association of Edison Illuminating Companies and developed financialinformation by modeling data extracted from COMPUSTAT II{trademark} tapes.The team calibrated generation additions, load growth, and unit outagerates to NERC data. 11 refs., 15 figs., 35 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
