This is introducedby some very general remarks on the use of technology and on the equipment,progress and application of pollution-reduction technologies. Referenceis made to the effects these processes have on the environment: The reportconcludes with considerations on the question of the cost/benefit ratioof this strategy and describes by way of examples the approach for anew strategy which can contribute towards preventing emissions as wellas waste products and residues and thus towards conserving ecologicalresources without causing a disproportionate rise in production costs:The fact that environmental problems are avoided at their source or originoffers ecological and economic benefits. By adopting the pollution-preventionstrategy we can also reach solutions of interest to both business andnational economics because such a new (cleaner) technology oriented inthis way lends hope that the following benefits will be achieved withoutadditional cost being involved: -resources and energies are exploitedmore carefully and economically through the use of these technologies.- Starting materials are used more efficiently and wast products areavoided or converted into usable materials: It can be assumed that thesenew technologies will set other innovation processes in motion and thusimprove the competitive position.</TEXT></DOC>
