The incident marked the first time students from the prestigious university have staged a protest march since the large pro-democracy rallies of December 1986. The earlier rallies, part of a nation-wide wave of student demonstrations, finally were crushed by the government.    Since then, students haven't dared take to the streets, with the exception of a brief rally last September by students at a Beijing business university, also to protest the murder of a colleague.    In Friday's demonstration, students locked arms and strode several miles from the suburban campus to the gates of the Ministry of Public Security at Tiananmen Square in the city's center. They criticized Beijing police for failing to preserve public safety and vowed to avenge the death of Chai Qingfeng, a 22-year-old graduate student.    Several hundred students briefly staged a sit-in at the ministry's gates.    Mr. Chai was beaten to death by a gang near the campus of Qinghua University. When his killing was announced on a campus poster Thursday evening, students spontaneously assembled and led the march to the city.    Beijing's police allowed the four-hour march to proceed without interference. As they walked under a clear, moonlit sky, students beat drums, sang the socialist Internationale and carried a banner that said, &quot;Avenge the debt in blood.&quot;    Passing Zhongnanhai, the secluded compound where many of China's top leaders live and work, students cried out, &quot;Protect our human rights.&quot;    When the rally reached the ministry, several student representatives were allowed into the compound to discuss their grievances with officials. Yuan Liben, representative from the Communist Party Secretariat, grabbed a loudspeaker and urged students to give up their protest and go home &quot;to research the situation more.&quot; He was hooted down by the crowd.    Many of the marchers said they also had demonstrated in the pro-democracy rallies of 1986. Then, they were asking for greater freedom from state interference. This time, they called for more police protection.    &quot;The police should do everything to find the murderers,&quot; said an angry 23-year-old physics student, walking his bicycle. &quot;When they find them, they should kill them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
