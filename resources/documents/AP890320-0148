ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Rep. Michael Barnes testified Mondaythat former CIA Director William Casey tried to discredit acongressional committee staff member at a time the panel wasinvestigating Oliver North's efforts on behalf of Nicaraguan rebels.   ``He indicated that a member of my staff had met with arepresentative of the Nicaraguan government,'' said Barnes, aMaryland Democrat. The CIA, Barnes said, found out about the meetingby intercepting a conversation between the Nicaraguan ambassador andthat country's foreign minister.   Barnes identified the staff member as Victor Johnson, who wasstaff director of the subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs. Atthe time, in late 1985 when official aid to the Nicaraguan rebelswas forbidden by U.S. law, Barnes' subcommittee was trying to pryinformation from the National Security Council on its activities.   His voice rising, the former congressman strongly denied therewas anything wrong with Johnson's contact with the Nicaraguangovernment.   ``My memory of what Casey said is that a member of my staff hadmet with a representative of the Nicaraguan government,'' saidBarnes. ``He told them if they were to improve the human rightssituation in their country, lifting martial law, restoring freedomof the press ... such steps could be of help to members of Congresstrying to reject aid to the Contras.''   ``Did he indicate to you the staff member gave classifiedinformation?'' asked Brendan Sullivan, North's lawyer.   ``No sir,'' Barnes said. ``I found the allegation he madebasically to be frivolous. He didn't allege a member of my staff waspassing classified information to the Nicaraguan government. On thecontrary, from what he told me, my staff was doing what it hadroutinely done.   ``I told him in my judgment, based on what he told me, that whatthis individual had done was perfectly appropriate.''   Casey died in early 1987.   Barnes, who left his House seat to make an unsuccessful try forthe Senate in 1986, said after meeting with Casey he told thechairman of the full Foreign Affairs committee about theconversation and ``he agreed the meeting was appropriate.''   The former Democratic congressman told Sullivan heatedly: ``Therewas never any allegation that Victor Johnson or any other member ofmy staff had provided classified information in any form to theNicaraguan government or any other government.''   Barnes, one of the leaders against aid to the Contras, alsotestified Monday that then-National Security Adviser RobertMcFarlane had seemed ``very nervous'' about the questions beingraised about North's activities.   Barnes said he was dissatisfied with a Sept. 12, 1985, letterfrom McFarlane denying that NSC staffers were raising money andoffering tactical advice to the guerrillas fighting the leftistNicaraguan government.   They met in McFarlane's White House office and McFarlane offeredto let Barnes _ but no congressional staffers _ examine documentsrelating to the Contras.   North, who was on McFarlane's staff, is being tried on chargesthat he obstructed Congress and made false statements in connectionwith the Sept. 12 letter and two others written in 1985.   ``Were you aware that North collaborated with Mr. McFarlane onwriting that letter?'' prosecutor Michael Bromwich asked. ``No,''Barnes said.   He said that in a later letter to McFarlane and in theface-to-face meeting, he requested all documents relating tocommunications between the United States government and the Contras.   ``I felt that Mr. McFarlane was very concerned about ourinvestigation, very nervous about it,'' Barnes said.   Barnes said he rejected McFarlane's offer to let him alone lookat the documents, saying it was always necessary in such cases tohave knowledgeable congressional staffers examine them.   The next witness after Barnes, Thomas Latimer, staff director ofthe House Intelligence Committee, testified about attempts by hiscommittee chairman in September 1986 to follow continuing reportsthat the NSC was violating the prohibition against helping theContras.   Latimer set up an Aug. 6 meeting between North and the committeein the White House. North spoke for 40-45 minutes, he said, denyingagain that he had violated the law.   ``He was asked specifically if he had given any miitary advice tothe Contras,'' Latimer said. ``He said he had not. He was asked ifhe was involved in any fund-raising. He said he had not.''   One of the obstruction-of-Congress charges against North is basedon his answers at that meeting. Under the ground rules set by theNational Security Council, no transcript was made but theprosecution introduced the notes that Latimer made at the time.   They reflected that North said he had explained the Bolandamendment restrictions to the Contra but ``never violatedstricture'' and merely``gave advice on human rights, civic actionprograms.''   Testimony at the trial has indicated that North made manyspeeches to potential donors to the Contra cause, although he leftthe pitches for money to others, and that he gave extensive adviceto the Nicaraguan rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
