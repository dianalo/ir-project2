Canaan Banana, co-chairman of the U.N.-appointed panel examiningthe role of multinational corporations in South Africa, saidparliamentary elections Wednesday would lead to little change in thecountry.   Lowell Weicker, a former U.S. senator and panel member, urged theUnited Nations to increase pressure on the South African governmentto end its policy of apartheid, which denies the black majority avoice in national affairs.   The panel's report to the United Nations will aim for greatercompliance with internationally agreed upon economic sanctions,especially regarding withdrawing investment from South Africa,Weicker said.   ``I expect this report to be extraordinarily tough,'' he told apress conference.   Banana, who was the first president of Zimbabwe, said one of thecentral themes in the report would be the tightening of financialsanctions.   This would particularly concern the rescheduling of loans to thecountry, he said. He refused to give further details.   South Africa has a foreign debt of $22 billion, according to U.N.figures. Half of this is covered by an agreement with creditor banksthat is due for renegotiation in 1990.   Banana said sanctions are the most effective way of weakeningSouth Africa's economy so that it cannot afford to maintainapartheid.   South African and multinational business leaders Tuesday saidfurther sanctions would hit the black population hardest andincrease the conservative backlash against change.   The panel heard testimony from groups including the AfricanNational Congress, the largest South African guerrilla group, andthe World Council of Churches, which repeated calls for mandatoryand comprehensive sanctions.   The 11 experts, mainly former leading public officials, heldthree days of public hearings. Their report, to be published by theend of the week, will be discussed by the U.N. General Assembly inNew York.</TEXT></DOC>
