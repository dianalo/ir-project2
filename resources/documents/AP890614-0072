Fang, although he remained aloof from the demonstrations in May,had made a personal enemy of chief communist Deng Xiaoping earlierwhen he criticized Marxism and the Chinese leadership publicly. Thatled to his expulsion from the Communist Party in 1987.   A government campaign to cast Fang as the organizer of an effortto overthrow the communist leadership is one of many harsh steps nowbeing taken against students and others who demonstrated peacefullyfor greater personal and press freedom. The action is exposing thegovernment's true colors. ...   At present the totalitarians in China have the upper hand. Buttheir time may be running out.   The United States should intensify its Voice of Americabroadcasts to mainland China and step up its criticism of the brutalmilitary suppression of peaceful students whose only crime wasseeking the freedoms now enjoyed by most of the non-communist world.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 13   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on China:   President Bush, who originally sought to keep the door open tonormal relations with China through the vicious military crackdownon the student uprising, is pursuing a lost cause.   Normalcy _ at least the normalcy of a China with a slowlyliberalizing government responsive to the will of the people _ nolonger exists in China. Any vestige was suspended in Beijing thenight the 27th Army opened fire on civilians in Tiananmen Square,and has been put to rout across the nation since then.   The aging, hard-line Communist leaders waging a campaign ofterror against their own people do not deserve continued tolerancefrom the United States. ...   There can be no business and cultural relations with a governmentwith as much blood on its hands and repression in its plans as theterrorist government of Deng, Li and Yang.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 12   The Miami Herald on China:   President Bush's measured response to the Chinese crisis is awelcome departure from the knee-jerk reactions that too oftenemanate from Washington on crucial foreign policy issues.   His frankness at his press conference in assessing the powerstruggle in Beijing was also refreshing. ...   At times ... Bush has seemed overcautious without reason. ButChina's turmoil presents every reason for caution, and the presidentprudently is exercising it.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 9   The Press-Enterprise, Riverside County, Calif., on Colombiancocaine:   Medellin, Colombia, is a sophisticated city of one million peoplehigh in an Andean valley. It is Colombia's chief commercial andmanufacturing center, is home to the University of Antioquia and theNational School of Mines, has a medical center that has successfullydone eight human heart transplants _ and is being violentlydepopulated at the rate of 10 murders per day.   That ... makes Medellin the homicide capital of the world,excluding war-zones like Beirut. This is because Medellin has becomethe world's cocaine production capital. ...   Smart Americans do not go there: they are automatically presumedby the locals to be Drug Enforcement Administration agents. The DEA,by the way, was chased out of town. Their informants developed ahabit of turning up dead, and tongueless. ...   Without this country's rich marketplace for their illicitproduct, the Medellin subculture might not exist.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 7   The Phoenix Gazette on the Polish elections:   Following the example of Soviet voters who crossed the names ofparty candidates off their ballots in recent elections ... Polishvoters overwhelmingly rejected a special, uncontested slate of 35prominent Communist Party officials.   The communist government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski has concededPoland's freest elections in four decades to Solidarity by alandslide.   Unfortunately, post-election euphoria is likely to beshort-lived. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told his supporters:``Our political victories will mean nothing if we don't improve theeconomy.''   Walesa has succeeded in legalizing Solidarity and in giving it avoice in the government, but the union will also share in the blameif economic reforms fail. ...   In the future, Walesa's most difficult task might not be holdingthe government to its promises, but keeping the support of impatientSolidarity members.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 8   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on the death of Khomeini:   The confusion and chaos surrounding (the) burial of the AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini follow the pattern of his 10-year reign over themost confusing and chaotic government confronting the community ofnations.   As Khomeini fades into history, there is the chance for a newIran to emerge, a nation willing to accept the responsibilities ofnationhood, a nation ready to recognize negotiation _ not terrorism_ as the way to achieve national goals.   The first step facing Iran is to avoid a bitter and protractedinternal power struggle.   As President Bush has said, ``We hope Iran will now move towardassuming a responsible role in the international community.''</TEXT><TEXT>   June 10   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on saving elephants:   Poachers are killing Africa's elephants at such a rate that theworld's largest land animals will be extinct within 20 years.   The best way to protect the elephants is to put the poachers outof business. And the best way to do that is to shut down the worldmarket for ivory.   President Bush did his part ... by banning ivory imports; othernations should follow.   Marine mammals ... are the source of part of the world's ivory,but most of it comes from elephant tusks. Ten years ago there werean estimated 1.5 million elephants in Africa. Now there are about500,000. Organized poachers are killing 200 to 300 a day.   Last year the United States imported $32.2 million worth ofivory, or 10 to 15 percent of the world's total. Bush's decision toban imports closes the door to a significant segment of the market.   A drop in demand would tend to push world prices down, therebyreducing poachers' incentives.   Other nations should quickly impose bans of their own.</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
