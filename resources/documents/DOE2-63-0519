In spite of the plane geometry of the analyzer, thecurrent-voltage measurement in different directions can provide usefulinformation for the three-dimensional measurement with the aid of numericaltechniques of computerized tomography. The practical usefulness of thismethod as a diagnostic tool is shown experimentally for a weakly ionizedcollisionless argon plasma into which a low-energy ion beam is injecteduniformly. Discussions are made with emphasis on the optimization ofmeasurement by compromising the contradiction between the spatial resolutionand the statistical accuracy.</TEXT></DOC>
