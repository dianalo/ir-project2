<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0732 </DOCNO><TEXT>Films of highly oriented DNA (A-, B-, and C-conformation) were investigatedby neutron scattering. Diffuse sheets corresponding to a one-dimensionallyperiodic ``water-DNA'' structure are identified close to the intersectionof the helix direction with the structure factor maximum of bulk water.The correlation length in this structure is strongly influenced by itscommensurability with the axial translation H per nucleotide. The fiberor lateral chain interaction is enhanced in the commensurate case. 10refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
