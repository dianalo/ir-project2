But in a continuing study of brokeragehouses' stock-picking prowess, two out-of-town firms havelately been beating the pants off the New York crowd.   A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. of St. Louis led a group of 10large brokerage firms in stock picking for the 12 monthsthrough March 31, with an estimated 20.9% return.</LP><TEXT>   Raymond James andamp; Associates Inc., St. Petersburg, Fla.,burned up the track in the first quarter, with a sizzlingreturn of 30.4% on its recommended stocks.   For the longer term, a New York firm, Smith Barney, HarrisUpham andamp; Co., remains on top. The Primerica Corp. unit has a105.2% return for the full 57 months covered by the study.   The study, conducted jointly by The Wall Street Journaland Zacks Investment Research Inc. of Chicago, estimates howinvestors would fare if they bought every stock highlyrecommended by their brokerage firms. In most cases, firmsare judged on an official recommended list drawn up by astock-selection committee.   The revival of small stocks greatly helped Edwards andRaymond James, which typically pick smaller, less well-knowncompanies than do the denizens of Gotham. Raymond James'srecommended stocks have been the smallest, as a group, with amedian market value of about $915 million. Those picked byEdwards have been only a little larger, at $1.2 billion. Theeight New York firms have picked stocks with a median marketvalue ranging from about $2 billion (Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.) to$10 billion (Smith Barney).   All 10 firms outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Averageand the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index last quarter -- animpressive showing. Long-term, only four of the 10 firms havebeaten the indexes.   Edwards currently likes cyclical stocks -- &quot;using a prettybroad definition of cyclical,&quot; says Research Director TerryDessent. By his lights, the term embraces such companies aschemical giant Du Pont Co., shoe and fabric concern BrownGroup Inc. and communications concern MCI CommunicationsCorp. In the first quarter, Edwards was also keen ontechnology stocks and interest-sensitive stocks, but it hascut back on those, mainly because they ran up in price.   Edwards follows a &quot;value&quot; approach to investing, seekingout stocks that seem cheap in relation to a company'searnings, net worth or dividends. This often leads to buyingstocks that are unpopular at the time, but it served the firmwell over the past 12 months.   &quot;I think there's a lesson that apparently has to berelearned every market cycle,&quot; says Mr. Dessent. &quot;All proveninvestment methodologies will have their day. . . . If youtry to hop from one hot style to the next hot style, odds areyou're going to be buying at the top. The lesson is to find amethod you're comfortable with -- ours is value -- and stickto it.&quot;   Adventuresome investors who can live with theroller-coaster ups and downs of Raymond James's stocks havecome out well in the long run. Its recommended stocks havebeen the most volatile of those recommended by the 10 firms,moving on average 32% further up or down than the market ingeneral.   For the full 57 months of the study, however, the firmranks second, with an estimated return of 101%. And it had awonderful quarter, with such big gainers as Health InfusionInc. (up 83%), Cascade International Inc. (up 67%), and ImcoRecycling Inc. (up 41%).   &quot;In the early stages of any turn in the economy and turnin the market, you're going to see the best performance inthe secondaries {smaller stocks},&quot; says David Henwood, thefirm's research director. But he cautions not to &quot;go blindlyinto these sorts of stocks.&quot;   For one thing, Raymond James tries to make sure that theprojected growth rate is higher than the price-earnings ratio(stock price divided by per-share earnings). For example, astock whose earnings are growing 18% a year might be a goodbuy at a P-E of 15, but not at a P-E of 22. Raymond James'sselections also feature the lowest dividend yield of thebunch, 1.45% on average.   Long-term leader Smith Barney has recently started torecommend some oil stocks -- Mobil Corp., Texaco Inc. andAmerada Hess Corp. With hefty dividends, the first two mightappeal to some investors as an alternative to a money-marketfund, suggests John B. Hoffman, associate director ofresearch.   Five of Smith Barney's 20 recommended stocks now aretechnology issues, such as Intel Corp., Silicon Graphics Inc.and International Business Machines Corp. &quot;It sounds stupid,&quot;says Mr. Hoffman, &quot;since they're getting killed&quot; in the pastfew days. &quot;We still think they're relatively cheap andunderowned.&quot;   Smith Barney has used a pretty strict value approach inselecting stocks. It features the biggest and most stablestocks, the highest dividend yield (4.09%), the lowest P-Eratio (12), and the lowest price-to-book ratio (1.34). Bookvalue is a company's stated net worth per share.   The other group Smith Barney likes is the cyclicals,including General Motors Corp., General Electric Co., paperand paper-goods concern Westvaco Corp. and Dow Chemical Co.Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., which had led the long-term rankings,lost ground and now ranks third for the long haul. WilliamKealy, Goldman's research director, notes that performancewas hurt by some utilities and &quot;defensive&quot; issues, the kindsof stocks that provide &quot;anchors to windward&quot; during marketdeclines.   &quot;Our attitude is to preserve and enhance capital for theclients,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't have the kind of clientele thatwant to be pummeled in bad quarters.&quot; Goldman's worst losslast quarter was a modest 4% decline in Norsk Hydro AS, aninternational oil company.   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American ExpressCo., which led the 12-month results last time, ranked secondfor 12 months and fourth for the long term. Some technologystocks still offer big potential gains, says researchdirector Fred Fraenkel, but investors have to pay carefulattention to where a company stands in its product cycle. Hisfavorite stocks now are financial stocks, because he expectsinterest rates to decline further.   Last for the quarter was Prudential Securities Inc., aunit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. Its 17% gainbeat the market averages handily, but left Prudential lastfor the long term, with a 48.8% return over 57 months.Michael Culp, research director, says the study's methodology-- in which an investor is assumed to act on a brokeragehouse's advice only at month's end -- understatedPrudential's first-quarter results by about 2.8 percentagepoints last quarter.   For the 12 months, the caboose was PaineWebber, with anestimated 6.3% return. But that's &quot;ancient history,&quot;commented research director James Voytko, since the problemswere concentrated in the second and third quarter of 1990.The firm tripped up then by recommending financial stocks andleisure and entertainment issues, he said; since then,financial stocks have recovered considerably.   ---     Comparing Brokerage Houses' Stock-Picking Prowess                                                                                                          Estimated performance of stocks recommended by major firmsin periods ended March 31, 1991, ranked by performance in themost recent 12 months                                                                                                           3       12      57         BIGGEST        BIGGEST  MONTHS  MONTHS  MONTHS        GAIN*          LOSS*                                                                                                        A.G.
