The council found out differentlylast week when several residents spoke out against the park and presented thecouncil with a petition signed by 69 neighbors in the area.;    The neighborssaid they fear a skateboard park would generate too much noise, not just fromthe facility but also from cars and &quot;boom boxes,&quot; and cited problems such asgraffiti and vandalism.;    Council members said they will continue theirefforts to get a skateboard park built.;    &quot;I favor a skateboard park and Ithink we can design one that works,&quot; said Councilman Victor Monia. &quot;I honestlythought Civic Center would be the least problem area.&quot;;    Councilman F.L.Stutzman called the neighborhood reaction &quot;one more poor reflection&quot; of thecommunity's attitude toward youth and that young people who grow up thinkingthe city never did anything for them might be justified in thinking that.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHAEL CRONK, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910814  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  283  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, August 14, 199100227323,SJ1  </DATELINE><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
