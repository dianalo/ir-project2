This method generates maximum countcircumferential profiles of the short-axis slices of the left ventricle,translates them into polar coordinate profiles, and displays them asa bullseye plot, which consists of a series of concentric circles withthe apex at the center and the base at the periphery. Normal limits wereestablished for the distribution of {sup 201}Tl in 36 patients with alow (less than 5%) probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-fivepatients who had undergone coronary angiography were used as a pilotgroup to define criteria for the identification and localization of perfusiondefects. The best agreement with the results of angiography was foundwhen abnormal regions of the bullseye were defined as contiguous defectsover 2.5 SDs below normal. These criteria were applied prospectivelyto 210 points (179 points with greater than 50% diameter stenosis and31 with less than 50%). Visual, quantitative, and combined visual andquantitative analysis were compared for overall detection of diseaseand for detection of individual vessel involvement. The overall sensitivityfor detection of disease by these methods was 97%, 95%, and 95%, respectively.The specificities were 68%, 74%, and 71% respectively. The sensitivityfor detection of individual vessel involvement with the bullseye alonewas 78% for the left anterior descending artery (LAD), 89% for the rightcoronary artery (RCA), and 65% for the left circumflex (LCx). For visualanalysis, the results were 70%, 88%, and 50%, respectively, while theuse of visual and quantitative analysis combined identified 75% of LAD,87% of RCA, and 55% of LCx lesions.</TEXT></DOC>
