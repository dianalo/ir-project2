Local health jurisdictions may apply with the concurrenceof the State Health Officer. <ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Funds </ITAG>Approximately $2,000,000 is available in Fiscal Year 1989 to fund approximately20 awards. It is anticipated that awards will be for a 12-month budgetperiod with a proposed project period ranging from l to 5 years. Fundingestimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards withinthe project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress andthe availability of funds. <ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose </ITAG>The purpose of this program is to assist the recipients' capability tocharacterize the relationship between exposure to hazardous substancesand adverse health outcomes through the development and use of site-specifichealth study protocols, studies at multiple sites with similar hazardoussubstances, and the implementation of site-specific or multiple-site healthinvestigations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Project Types </ITAG>Assistance, both financial and technical, will be provided to the recipientsfor conducting the following types of projects: A. Pilot Studies 1. Exposure studies consist of the biological sampling of persons at potentiallyhigh risk of exposure to determine if exposure can be verified. Test resultswill be compared with published normal values or with results from unexposedreference populations. The biological tests may include direct assay ofchemicals or their metabolites or an indirect assay testing for other biologicalmarkers of exposure. If exposure to hazardous substances can be verified,additional investigations to determine if adverse health effects are occurringmay be recommended. Follow-up recommendations may include public education,additional environmental sampling, additional biological exposure studies,epidemiologic studies, registries, surveillance projects, or remedial actions.2. Cluster investigation studies are investigations of putative diseaseclusters to determine if the cases represent an unexpected excess in thenumber of cases in the concerned community. Investigations are designedto confirm the case reports; determine if they represent an unusual diseaseoccurrence; and, if possible, explore possible etiologic and environmentalfactors. Follow-up recommendations may include public education, additionalenvironmental sampling, biological exposure studies, epidemiologic studies,registries, surveillance projects, or remedial actions. 3. Symptom and disease prevalence studies are designed to measure the occurrenceof self-reported diseases which may be validated through medical records,if available. In these studies, investigators collect citizens' healthconcerns in a standardized manner and determine if a health problem existsin the community that requires further investigation. If unusual diseaseoccurrence is discovered, additional investigations to determine etiologicfactors may be undertaken. The recommendations developed for identifiedhealth problems may include public education, additional environmentalsampling, biological exposure studies, epidemiologic studies, registries,surveillance projects, or remedial actions. B. Epidemiologic Studies Epidemiologic studies are analytic investigations designed to evaluatethe possible causal relationships between exposure to hazardous substancesand disease outcome by testing a scientific hypothesis. Information suchas the strength of the association between two factors and biological plausibilityof the outcome is to be considered. Case-control, cohort, cross-sectional,survival, or other scientifically valid study designs may be considered.Recommendations may include public education, additional environmentalsampling, registries, surveillance projects, or remedial actions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Requirements </ITAG>A. Cooperative Agreements In a Cooperative Agreement, the funding agency will assist the collaboratorin conducting the studies to determine the relationship between exposureto hazardous substances and illness. The application should be presentedin a manner that demonstrates the applicant's ability to address the healthproblem in a collaborative manner with the funding agency. The Cooperative Activities of the recipient agency and the funding agencyare as follows: <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Recipients Activities </ITAG>a. <T3>Background review</T3>_Review environmental sampling information, humandisease surveillance information, and other appropriate information toidentify populations potentially exposed to hazardous substances.b. <T3>Study design and implementation</T3>_Design, develop, and implementa protocol to conduct the necessary pilot or epidemiologic study. c. <T3>Peer review</T3>_Recipient, with assistance from the funding agency,will conduct a peer review of the proposed study protocol prior to implementationof the pilot or epidemiologic study and at the completion of the studyprior to submission to the funding agency. The peer review should be conductedby a scientific committee with appropriate representation to objectivelyevaluate the study findings. The pear review group should have three toseven disinterested scientific experts selected on the basis of their reputationfor scientific objectivity. Members of the committee must be individualsnot employed by the grantee or funding agency and must not have institutionalties with any person involved in the conduct of the study under review.The committee should be appointed by the grantee, with collaboration fromthe funding agency. As a part of the final report to be submitted to thefunding agency, the peer review process should be documented, includingpeer reviewers' comments and the disposition of any issues raised. d. Recipient is expected to maintain accurate and timely accounting recordswith proper classification of expenditures in order to allow a full costrecovery of funds awarded under the grant or cooperative agreement. e. Recipient is required to provide proof by way of citation to state codeor regulation or other state pronouncement given the authority of law,that medical information obtained pursuant to the agreement, pertainingto an individual and therefore considered confidential, will be protectedfrom disclosure when the consent of the individual to release identifyinginformation is not obtained. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. ATSDR Activities </ITAG>a. Assist in the development of the pilot or epidemiologic study. b. Assist in the analysis of information on background morbidity and mortalityrates for the study area. c.

Consult with and assist in monitoring the collection and handling ofinformation and the sampling and testing activities. e. Participate in the statistical and epidemiologic analysis. f. Collaborate in the interpretation of the study findings. g. Collaborate with recipient in organizing and conducting a peer reviewof study protocol and the results of the study prior to publication andsubmission of the final report. B. Grants A grant application should be presented in a manner that demonstrates theapplicant's ability to address the environmental health problem. In additionto financial aupport requested, the application should include a protocolto conduct the pilot or epidemiologic study. The protocol should containconsent forms and questionnaires, baseline morbidity and mortality information,the procedure to collect biologic and environmental specimens, laboratoryanalysis and medical evaluation of test results of biologic specimens,statistical and epidemiologic analysis of study information, and a descriptionof the safeguards to protect the confidentiality of individuals on whomdata is collected.
