Mr. Smith, a narcotics detective nearing the end of a six-month undercover operation here, was in a local bar when two men grabbed him and pulled him into the restroom. &quot;We've got some serious problems with you,&quot; said one man, from whom Mr. Smith had bought marijuana just the week before. The man accused him of having given secret testimony about local drug dealing to a grand jury, describing in detail testimony that the detective had, in fact, just given.    Mr. Smith strenuously denied it, and managed to get out of the place. He began sleeping with two loaded pistols by his bed. Yet, hoping the leak was confined to a narrow circle, he decided to continue infiltrating the local drug culture until the appointed bust.    That was early yesterday. And though not all went as planned, the operation reached a climax with a 5:30 a.m. series of arrests. As a confrontation earlier in the night would show, Mr. Smith had stayed under cover until the last possible moment.    Though the war on drugs now often is waged with speedboats, planes and sophisticated tracking devices, its front-line soldiers still are faceless detectives like Mr. Smith. These are not television cops; no sound track accompanies a marijuana buy in Mason, Ohio. Their work, as a week spent with Mr. Smith near the end of the Mason operation shows, involves danger and ethical dilemmas, but it also entails mind-numbing hours of inactivity and humiliating rejections by two-bit dealers they are trying to befriend in pool halls.    &quot;Undercover work is the most difficult, exposed, dangerous assignment the public asks one of its representatives to take,&quot; says Peter Bensinger, a former head of the federal Drug Enforcement Agency. &quot;It isn't always glamorous, high-tension, high-rolling, high-money transactions. It is repetitive, dull, tedious and very frustrating.&quot;    Going undercover also can impose a burden in terms of a detective's sense of himself. Outfitted like a deadbeat, he must get used to people subtly reacting to him as such -- to a mother, for instance, holding her children close as he passes by. He must get used to the constant edginess that threatens to develop into paranoia.    When it all gets to be too much for Mr. Smith, he sometimes stands before a bathroom mirror in his seedy room. &quot;I am Gary Smith,&quot; he says aloud to the scruffy figure peering back. &quot;I live in Wisconsin. I have a wife who loves me, and a house. I will make it.&quot;    Mr. Smith's assignment in this quiet community of 10,000 near Cincinnati began last September. Town officials, wanting to ferret out drug dealers but mindful that local detectives would be recognizable, hired a detective agency to supply an undercover man at $5,000 a month. That agency, Mr. Smith's employer, is Professional Law Enforcement Inc. of Dayton, Ohio, one of a growing number of security firms offering such services.    Using the cover of a traveling errand boy for a rich father, Mr. Smith (his real name) immersed himself in the town's drug culture, sharing &quot;roach clips&quot; with dealers, courting drug-hungry women and haunting darkened streets and bars into the wee hours. No one in Mason was told of his identity except the police chief and his two staff detectives.    He fights the drug wars unarmed but well-defended by his wits and a knack for blending in. A 32-year-old college graduate and former policeman, he looks more like a drifter in his flowing beard, black Panama hat and baggy clothes -- the same ones often worn for days on end. Anyone can dress the part, but Mr. Smith is blessed with a particularly convincing feature: bad teeth. The overall effect is unsettling; &quot;Gary looks nuts,&quot; says an agency administrator, Gary Vest.    Mr. Smith likes undercover work because the only thing that counts is results. He leaves far behind the politics and paper-shuffling that he hated about standard police work. Still, he lives with some irksome restraints. Mason's budget, for example, is so tight approval is needed for any drug buy of over $200.    &quot;It's exasperating,&quot; he says. &quot;I mean, we're never going to stop the flow of drugs at this rate. I've got to spend all this time with small buys and second-rate dealers just to have a chance at getting up the ladder.&quot;    In such an environment, sampling illicit pleasures is also a constant temptation; last year more than 300 undercover officers nationwide were themselves arrested on drug and other offenses. Mr. Smith worries about his drinking habits; to do his job well, he must repeatedly spend long evenings knocking back beers with drug dealers and users.    &quot;We have to be priests,&quot; says Mr. Smith, &quot;yet a sex maniac and a drug addict at the same time.&quot;    In some ways, working in towns like Mason is more challenging than similar work in, say, New York City. In New York, a senator seeking to prove a point can buy &quot;crack&quot; from strangers on a street corner, but here a detective can buy only from people he has gotten to know. &quot;In these small towns, people have known each other practically since birth,&quot; says Edward Probst, a PLE supervisor. &quot;They've all gone to school together. It's tough to infiltrate that.&quot;    Yet the danger is still there. The recent murder of a teen-age girl in a Mason park is unsolved but suspected of being drug-related. Another PLE agent, working in another Ohio town, recently found himself pinned to the ground by a wild-eyed drug dealer with a knife who &quot;told me if I was a cop I was dead meat.&quot;    A week in the life of Gary Smith, accompanied by a reporter he introduces as an old friend, illustrates some of the highs and lows of small-town undercover work.    Friday   Shortly after 7 p.m. on a freezing night, Gary slides into his black Sunbird and pops a cassette into the tape player. &quot;Let's roll,&quot; he says, as, to the pulsing sound of the theme from &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; he peels out of the gravel parking lot.    Tonight's focus is a 28-year-old drug user mentioned by several people with whom the detective struck up conversations. Two nights ago Gary met her by a simple but unorthodox maneuver: He walked to her front door and introduced himself. Flashing a roll of $100 bills seemed to help break the ice.    Through this woman, whom we will call &quot;Julie,&quot; Gary has met a dealer from the Cincinnati area, a fast-talking man in his mid-20s whom we will call &quot;Mike.&quot; He has ordered a quarter-ounce of marijuana and some Valium pills, to be delivered this night at the cramped, littered apartment of the woman's sister and brother-in-law -- across from the Mason police headquarters. While they wait for the dealer to arrive, Gary and his hosts sip beer and watch Donald Duck cartoons.    Before long &quot;Mike&quot; breezes in, a blondbearded young man in a red sweatshirt. From his wrist hangs a yellow plastic K mart shopping bag filled with Baggies of marijuana and a colorful assortment of pills.    &quot;Good news, bad news, dude,&quot; the dealer cheerfully tells Gary. &quot;I got the quarter, but I need the V's for later.&quot; Gary hands over $35 for a banana-shaped packet of marijuana and arranges to buy the Valium the following week. No questions, no hassle: the best kind of drug buy.    But now he can't just walk out; &quot;Julie&quot; and the others expect to get at least a little high. A joint is rolled and passed around. And Gary, having asked to buy the dope, can hardly decline it.    This presents several problems. At least some of the drug must be saved as evidence of the buy, evidence he will turn over to the police as soon as possible. Moreover, the detective knows that taking drugs, besides violating the law, is against his employer's policy and a sure way to ruin a case against the dealer.    And it will be known whether he has indulged; PLE agents must take lie-detector and drug tests after each operation. So when the joint comes his way, Gary takes the smoke into his mouth without inhaling, the hot fumes rasping at the back of his throat before he slowly exhales. His reporter friend does the same.    The sister of &quot;Julie,&quot; holding a baby in one arm, takes the joint and sucks in deeply. Thick smoke settles softly over the family's three sleepy children. &quot;I try not to keep much pot around the house, just my personal stash,&quot; the brother-in-law says between drags. &quot;You know, the kids and all.&quot;    Most undercover operations target neither Colombian drug lords nor Mafia capos, and Gary's are no exception. To &quot;climb the ladder&quot; to big dealers, detectives have to begin with factory workers, housewives, teen-agers and businessmen -- often family people with sad stories and everyday worries. Says William Taylor, PLE's president: &quot;When the old lady fixes you dinner and you start playing with the kids, that's when you start feeling a little guilty. You realize that if you do your job, you'll break up a family.&quot;    Few tasks bother Gary more than &quot;working&quot; female sources. &quot;I love my wife very much,&quot; he says, before setting out this evening. &quot;I couldn't do anything out here without her.&quot;    He goes to great lengths to maintain a healthy marriage; every Saturday night he begins an 11-hour round-trip drive to his home in Wisconsin. He returns each Tuesday, locking his life and love in a gray-metal strongbox in the trunk of his car. Inside the box are police manuals, log books recording his activities, pictures of his wife -- and his wedding ring. All this weighs on him when, at a raucous bar later this night with &quot;Julie,&quot; Gary rests his hand in the small of her back and, in the din from a heavy-metal rock trio, strokes her hair. She places her hand on his knee.    Driving home, Gary asks the woman to accompany him to Florida in April. &quot;I hope we can share it together,&quot; he says, and the two hold hands above the car's stick shift. At evening's end, he walks her to her front porch. In the darkness they embrace.    &quot;You know,&quot; Gary says, returning to the car, &quot;in another world, another time, she might have been somebody.&quot;    After stops at two Mason bars, he returns to his room at 3:30 a.m., then walks outside to a pay phone to call his wife. In 20-degree weather, he talks with her for more than an hour.    Wednesday   Five nights later the dealer and a promised Valium buy are nowhere to be found. The evening seems wasted until &quot;Julie,&quot; like some drug-culture Avon lady, volunteers to go door-to-door among friends in search of marijuana. &quot;This is the kind of night I love,&quot; Gary whispers later as she scampers to a door. &quot;Look at all the places she's taking us. Think of all the people we'll meet.&quot;    Only when it seems all the friends will pile into his car at once does the detective get irritated. &quot;This is getting to be a three-ring circus,&quot; he mutters at one stop. By 10 p.m. he is escorting three self-described potheads to what seems like the 20th Ohio town in search of marijuana. Finally, a biker in nearby Lebanon provides a quarter-ounce for $45.    It has been a lot of work for such a tiny payoff; Gary, not having seen the buy occur, can only tip police or hope to buy from the biker later. Most narcs don't dwell on the fact that they aren't making much of a dent in the national drug nightmare. &quot;Remember,&quot; Gary says at one point as a drug dealer approaches his car, &quot;if we don't make the deal, no one cares. No one cares at all. No dope deal is worth getting killed over.&quot;    After the biker buy, Gary wonders aloud why the other dealer didn't show. &quot;He might think you're a narc,&quot; says &quot;Julie&quot; matter-of-factly. &quot;But that's stupid. I wouldn't show no narcs around. Besides, he hasn't known you as long as I have.&quot; It has been exactly one week since they met.    Thursday   A light snow is falling as Gary follows the blue sedan into the bustling streets of nearby Hamilton, Ohio. There, at the home of one of Mason's two regular detectives, he updates the town's police chief. Gary has been &quot;under&quot; so long he has forgotten the chief's name.    It is James Edwards. Mr. Edwards smiles as the undercover man reels off names of the dealers he has bought drugs from. &quot;You're leading us into an inner circle we've been trying to get at for years,&quot; the chief says.    Peter Schultz, one of the town's detectives, says, &quot;We're not naive enough to think this will end our drug problem, but it'll make dopers think long and hard the next time they sell another joint.&quot;    That night Gary and &quot;Julie&quot; find their no-show dealer at a Mason house. He is regaling friends by telling how he supposedly beat drug tests at his workplace by swallowing a mixture of water, fruit juice and aspirin. Though temporarily &quot;dry,&quot; or out of inventory, &quot;Mike&quot; agrees to help Gary buy Valium or marijuana from a dealer at a nearby pool room.    Once there, Gary orders a beer, chalks up a cue stick and gets to work. Between games of eight ball, he disappears outside with the youthful new dealer, returning 10 minutes later with another quarter-ounce of marijuana. Two hours later, the two again disappear, this time into a dank, concrete-block bathroom, returning minutes later with more marijuana that Gary says is for a friend. He ducks out a third time to secretly jot down the license plate of the new dealer's car. During a fourth trip he sets up a Valium buy with &quot;Mike.&quot;    By 2 a.m. the narc and the two young dealers have become pool-playing, back-slapping, beer-drinking buddies. At one point, as the three lean on their cues between games, snippets of conversation can be heard through the din of a jukebox.    &quot;We could do it. We could do it. He's cool. He's cool.&quot;    &quot;Could we really buy a whole ounce?&quot;    &quot;Five-fifty? Man, what a price!&quot;    &quot;You're blowing my mind! You're blowing my mind!&quot;    By closing time Gary has arranged his biggest deal yet in Mason, agreeing to supply more than $500 to help the two young men buy an ounce of cocaine for $2,000. Smiles abound as the three walk outside into falling snow. On the drive back to Gary's tiny room, the car radio blares an anti-drug song called &quot;Smuggler's Blues&quot;:    It's a losing proposition,   but someone had to lose.    It's the nature of the business.    It's the smuggler's blues.    Yesterday morning at 5:30, more than 40 officers from several Ohio law-enforcement groups began arresting some three dozen suspected drug dealers and users named in about 100 indictments -- one indictment for every 100 inhabitants of Mason. Most were were roused bleary-eyed from their beds.    The arrests climaxed an otherwise dismal night for Mr. Smith and the Mason police. After two scheduled drug buys had fallen through by 1:30 a.m., Mason detectives made plans to raid an after-hours party at a local bar, where they hoped to find drugs and maybe &quot;roll&quot; some dealers, that is, coax them into cooperating. But Mr. Smith, inside the bar with another agent, was again heatedly accused of being an undercover agent. At 2 a.m., Mason police received an urgent call from his partner. &quot;I think you better come get Gary out -- now,&quot; he said.    Ten minutes later, eight Mason and PLE detectives with pistols drawn burst in and lined up the 25 or so patrons against the bar. They also arrested and handcuffed Mr. Smith, mindful that blowing his cover now might jeopardize the arrests scheduled for three hours later.    That didn't convince two patrons, who continued to accuse Mr. Smith of being a narc. So the handcuffed detective suddenly charged one of the men, flailing with his shoulders and kicking until pulled away. &quot;I thought someone would stop me,&quot; Mr. Smith said later, &quot;so I kicked him.&quot;    Later yesterday morning, Mr. Smith stood in the Warren County Jail and watched as more than 20 of his drug sources -- among them &quot;Julie&quot; -- were brought in in handcuffs. Many gaped or stared when they saw a badge hanging from Mr. Smith's neck. Not one uttered a word. </TEXT></DOC>
