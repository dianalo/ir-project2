The RAF said in a statement that two bodies were found beforedawn in wreckage strewn over the countryside near the village ofMilburn and the third body was later found in the same area.   The village, in the Cumbrian hills, is about 240 miles northwestof London.   Rescue helicopters with powerful lights and a hill rescue teamon foot rushed to the remote, sparsely populated area after thetwo-seater fighters collided Tuesday night.   The area is regularly used for low-level training flights, withmilitary jets skimming just a few hundred feet over hills and farmbuildings as pilots practice avoiding radar detection by flyingunder the beams.   An eyewitness, Alan Knell, landlord of the Stag Inn in Milburn,told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a radio interview:   ``A big red ball (of fire) came in the sky. I didn't knowwhether it was the sun coming up. It was just a mass of bright red... and then rockets and flares went off and then there was anothersort of explosion. The noise was absolutely tremendous.''   Knell said the planes narrowly missed the pub. He said there hadbeen a lot of low-level flights earlier in the day.   The RAF said this year that it would modify its Tornado fightersbecause of earlier collisions, but gave no date for completion ofthe modifications. The decision followed a Defense Ministry reportin May on a December 1986 nighttime incident in which one RAFTornado flew into the back of another.   The report called for improved exterior lighting and otherchanges so pilots can assess distances better. All the crewmeninvolved in the 1986 collision survived.   Currently, 220 Tornados are in service in Britain and another165 are being built for the RAF at a cost of $30 million each.   The Tornado was jointly developed and built by Britain, WestGerman and Italy and first came into service in 1979.   In the previous most recent accident involving a Tornado, twoRAF crewmen were killed when the Tornado they were in crashed inWest Germany in May.   Legislator Dale Campbell-Savours of the opposition Labor Partysaid after visiting the scene of Tuesday night's collision accusedPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government ofignoring warnings about the dangers of low-level training flights.   ``The whole program is completely out of control,'' he charged.</TEXT></DOC>
