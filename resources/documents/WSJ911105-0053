The two collaborating teams found a gene that can renderthe male part of a plant sterile. This prevents the plantfrom pollinating itself, thereby allowing pollination by aneighboring plant to produce a hybrid offspring. Theresearchers also found a second gene that can restore malefertility to the progeny of the male-sterile plant and thuspreserve the strain for future use.</LP><TEXT>   The new genetic technique could cut the cost of producingseed for hybrid corn, feed grains and certain oil seeds. Thetechnique could also be a major step toward developinghybrids of other major crops.   The new genetic &quot;switches&quot; for male sterility have beensuccessfully engineered into corn, cotton, tomato, lettuce,Belgian endive and chicory, according to plant geneticistRobert B. Goldberg of the University of California, LosAngeles.   Dr. Goldberg's team in California discovered the genesthat render the male part of a plant sterile and developedthe genetic switches that turn the male sterility on and off.Plant Genetic Systems N.V. in Ghent, Belgium, is engineeringthe genetic switches into economically important plants.   Dr. Goldberg described the development to reportersattending the annual &quot;New Horizons in Science&quot; seminar here,sponsored by the Illinois Institute of Technology and theCouncil for the Advancement of Science Writing.   Hybrids produced by cross breeding different strains of aplant are immensely important to agriculture because theyusually show a &quot;vigor&quot; that produces bigger yields of seedsand fruit than either of the hybrid's parent strains. TheU.S. corn and sorghum feed grain crops are almost entirelyhybrid plants for this reason.   Producing seed for hybrid plants, however, is expensiveand very difficult. In most plants the male organ producingthe pollen is near or even adjacent to the female organ andthe plant pollinates itself. To produce hybrid seed, thisself-fertilization must be blocked so that the plant can befertilized with pollen from another strain.   Preventing self-pollination is labor intensive. In corn, asmall bag must be tied around the pollen-producing tassel orthe plant may be sprayed with a male sterility-inducingchemical. But in many plants including soybeans, cotton,wheat and rice the pollen-producing male organ is so close tothe female organ that preventing self-fertilization isprohibitively expensive. Producing hybrid rice seed islimited almost solely to China where labor is cheap, forinstance, Dr. Goldberg noted.   Dr. Goldberg said he and his colleagues in California,working initially with tobacco, set out a few years ago tofind genes in plants that were involved solely in producingpollen and had no function in any other tissue in the plant.Among the estimated 25,000 genes involved in producingpollen, the researchers isolated one called TA 29, whichhelps to make the inner lining of the sac that encloses thepollen grains and is active only briefly during the earlydevelopment of pollen. Without this inner lining of the sac,pollen won't develop.   In a second step, the geneticist said, the researcherslooked around for a genetic &quot;switch&quot; that would turn the TA29 gene off, preventing the production of pollen. They foundthat certain bacteria produce proteins that could knock outthe TA 29 gene. The genetic engineers in Belgium took thebacterial gene spliced into genetic control segments from thetobacco plant and engineered the entire assemblage in tobaccoplants.   When it came time for the TA 29 gene to be &quot;turned on&quot; tohelp make pollen, the bacterial gene was turned on, the TA 29gene destroyed, and the plant rendered male sterile becauseit couldn't produce pollen. Dr. Goldberg described theprocess as a kind of &quot;genetic laser.&quot;   In their third and most recent advance, the two researchteams found a second bacterial gene that can destroy theprotein produced by the first bacterial gene. This secondgene, spliced into a plant, will prevent the TA 29 gene frombeing knocked out and thus leave the plant's male fertile.The &quot;restorer&quot; gene can be spliced into the plant. Morelikely, Dr. Goldberg suggested, seed producers would simplylet a male-sterile plant be pollinated by a neighboring plantwith the restorer gene. The next generation would be malefertile. This way the seed producers could preserve theparent strains for future use.   The California scientist said his colleagues at PlantGenetic Systems had spliced the new geneticsterility-fertility switches used in the tobacco plant intoother plants where they worked equally well. The Belgiancompany has applied for patents on the genetic-switchingtechnology. Dr. Goldberg said he thinks the technique isapplicable to corn and grain sorghum, but that its firstcommercial use may be in oil seed rape, the plant thatproduces canola oil and which is a major Canadian crop.   The scientist cautioned that seed producers must solve asecond problem before farmers are likely to see hybrids ofsuch major crops as wheat, cotton and soybeans. This is howto waft pollen from one strain of plants in the field ontomale-sterile plants growing nearby. The wind is an effectivepollen carrier for corn and sorghum grains. But the anatomyof many other plants makes it hazardous for hybrid seedproducers to rely on the wind for cross pollination.</TEXT></DOC>
