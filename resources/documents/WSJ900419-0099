The conference illustrated the enormous difficulty offorging a global policy to head off a potential disastrouswarming of the earth caused by a buildup of carbon dioxideand other so-called greenhouse gases.</LP><TEXT>   The Dutch, West Germans and some other Europeans said theywere ready to adopt strict limits on carbon-dioxideproduction. Apparently nobody else was. The U.S. and theJapanese said more study is needed, and the Japanese promoteda 100-year plan to solve warming through new technology. TheSoviets said they need a new tax system. The Indonesians andthe Poles said they are broke.   &quot;Due to a difficult economic situation, we are not able atthis moment to take up our obligations to reduce carbondioxide emissions,&quot; said Jan Janowski, Poland's deputy primeminister, who spent much of his speech praising the U.S. andtrashing totalitarianism.   President Bush said, &quot;We have never considered research(on global warming) a substitute for action.&quot; Padraig Flynn,the European Council's minister for the environment, alongwith a horde of environmentalists who hovered around theconference, pointed to that as a commitment by the U.S. to dosomething specific about global warming.   But the White House has said that for some time, whiledodging proposals that would require the U.S. to reducegreenhouse emissions. The U.S. delegation to the conferencewas advised in two pages of &quot;talking points&quot; prepared by theWhite House to avoid discussions of whether warming isaccelerating. &quot;A better approach is to raise the manyuncertainties that need to be better understood on thisissue,&quot; the paper advised.   The talking points were distributed to reporters byenvironmentalists, to whom they had been leaked.   After the president's speech, D. Allan Bromley, thepresident's science adviser, said the U.S. hadn't changed itsglobal-warming policy &quot;whatsoever&quot; because of Europeancriticism. He said the U.S. will be able to &quot;respond&quot; tospecific proposals late this year, when the U.S. plans tohost preliminary talks on a global warming treaty. But &quot;thatdoesn't mean we'll have a particular percentage or particulartimetable&quot; regarding greenhouse gas stabilization orreduction in mind, he quickly added.   The only concrete proposals President Bush made were tobuild international institutes to study global change andcomputer networks to link researchers. But even thoseseemingly innocuous suggestions sparked controversy when theywere circulated early yesterday. A number of delegatesthought the U.S. was trying to ram the proposals past themwithout asking for their assent and that the wording of theproposals was designed to get them to admit that scientificknowledge about global warming is more uncertain than theybelieve it is. So the U.S. withdrew the proposals, and thepresident later characterized them as merely &quot;ideas.&quot;   The sensitivity of the delegates and the apparent distrustof each other's motives was much in evidence. The U.S.repeatedly criticized a proposal by the Dutch and others tosharply reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Americans saidit failed to take into account the economic costs. But J.G.M.Alders, minister of the environment in the Netherlands, saidhis government had thoroughly studied the problem and foundthe costs negligible.   &quot;Do you believe we could go home and take such measureswithout anybody saying, `What are the economic effects?'&quot; heasked.</TEXT></DOC>
