Thomas Arington president and chief executive officer and said it plans to acquire Mr. Arington's sales and marketing concern, Marketmaster Inc.    The 50-year-old Mr. Arington, who was also named a director, will succeed Dasan Potti, 51, who will continue as chairman.    The generic drug manufacturer said it plans to buy Marketmaster, of which Mr. Arington is president and sole shareholder, for 200,000 Duramed common shares. Based on Duramed's closing price of $5, unchanged, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday, the transaction has an indicated value of $1 million. Marketmaster has been engaged exclusively in selling Duramed products on commission.    As part of the acquisition, Duramed said, Mr. Arington or someone he assigns would purchase 200,000 authorized but unissued Duramed shares from the company for $5 a share, or $1 million. Duramed has about 2.5 million shares outstanding.    Duramend also said that Director Philip McManus resigned to &quot;devote more time to his personal business activities.&quot; Mr. Arington will fill his vacant seat.    Separately, the company said it expects to post a steeper-than-expected loss for the third quarter. It said its operating loss in the quarter was about $985,000, instead of the $750,000 loss anticipated in early October. In addition, as previously reported, the company expects to post a $1 million to $1.5 million pretax loss from the recall of certain batches of Conjugated Estrogens products made between January 1986 and June 1987.    In the year-earlier quarter, Duramed earned $417,000, or 21 cents a share, including $192,000 of tax credits, and had sales of $4.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
