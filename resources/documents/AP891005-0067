The troops were sent to the Armenian capital, Yerevan, after theSupreme Soviet legislature on Tuesday ordered the ministries ofdefense and interior to restore rail traffic between the twofeuding Transcaucasian republics.   The troops began arriving Wednesday night, Avel Pogosyan, aneditor at the Armenpress news agency in Yerevan, said in atelephone interview. Trains were moving today.   Striking rail workers in Azerbaijan, motivated by ethnicdemands, imposed a virtual economic blockade of Armenia by blockingrail lines and sabotaging cargo, news reports said. Armenia dependsheavily on trains for its supplies.   ``In August and September, 32,000 rail cars with food, fuel andconstruction materials failed to reach Armenia from Azerbaijan dueto sabotage,'' Moscow radio said. In Azerbaijan, ``bridges wereburned and trains were attacked with fire'' to prevent them fromreaching Armenia.   As a result of the blockade and sabotage, workers in Armeniaattempting to rebuild housing demolished by December's devastatingearthquake do not have fuel and supplies to continue, the newspaperSocialist Industry said.   ``Thousands of tons of fuel have not been delivered and as aresult, even emergency aid vehicles cannot be filled with fuel,''the newspaper said. ``As winter approaches, restoration plans arenot being fulfilled and foreign specialists are leavingconstruction sites.''   The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Azerbaijani deputyprosecutor R. Safarliev as saying the strike was in retaliation forArmenian sabotage of Azerbaijan railroads in July and August.   ``This actually provoked the strike by railroad workers ... andthe blockade itself,'' Safaraliev said. However, he added, ``I wantto emphasize that these measures cannot be justified.''   The Supreme Soviet voted 364-6 to adopt an emergency resolutiongiving the military and police authority to maintain railroadsecurity in the Transcaucasus. The measure was weaker than onefavored by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who wanted to ban allstrikes in the nation for the next 15 months.   Radio Moscow said military and police would be assigned toprotect certain sections of the main rail lines between the tworepublics, locked in a bitter dispute over the Armenian enclave ofNagorno-Karabakh inside Azerbaijan.   Control over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of mostly ChristianArmenians situated inside Moslem-dominated Azerbaijan, is the focalpoint of the dispute that has claimed 117 lives since violencebegan 19 months ago.</TEXT></DOC>
