But some of the 5,400 Israeli Arabs pilgrims said they identifiedmore with the Palestinians' 18-month uprising in the occupied landsthan with Israel.   ``We are proud of the uprising. It has given us more respectoutside,'' said Hosni Nuseirat, 42, of the northern Israeli villageof Taibeh.   ``We have deep ties to the Palestinians in the occupiedterritories. It's religion that binds us together, and we are allmembers of the same nation,'' Nuseirat said.   There are 810,000 Israeli Arab citizens, from families whoremained in Israel when the Jewish state was founded in 1948.   About 1.7 million Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip, including those who fled Israel in 1948 and residents ofthe occupied lands before they were captured in the 1967 Middle Eastwar.   Nuseirat and about 1,400 other Israeli Arab pilgrims, most inwhite robes and white prayer caps, sat in two dozen buses waitingfor a last security check before crossing the Allenby Bridge intoJordan.   Women wearing white scarves repacked their belongings aftersearches by soldiers, reassembling bed rolls and plastic shoppingbaskets filled with rice, sugar, olives, coffee and tea.   About 5,400 Israeli Arabs, up about 400 from last year, areleaving for Mecca via Jordan this week. They are scheduled to returnby July 21.   Mecca is Islam's holiest site, and making the hajj, orpilgrimage, is one of the chief religious duties of Moslems.   Saudi Arabia and Jordan, both technically at war with Israel,first permitted Israeli Arabs to join the hajj in 1977. Saudi Arabialimits the number of pilgrims, and Israel only gives exit permits toMoslems who are 30 years of age or older, citing security reasons.   ``We are angry about this. In our religion, there is no suchthing as an age limit,'' said Yehiah Haj, 31, also of Taibeh.   Haj made his first pilgrimage last year and said Israeli Arabsattract much attention in Saudia Arabia. ``When we say where we arefrom, people gather around. They want to know what's going on inIsrael,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
