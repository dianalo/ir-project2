The Japan-PRC coalliquefaction joint development venture program is divided into parts:one up to the contract signing and the other up to the construction ofa small continuous liquefaction plant and its subsequent operation. Thepurpose of the joint venture is to determine the liquefaction characteristicsof the chosen coals, so as to select the coal most suitable for liquefaction.The 'agreements' stipulated the division of work to be undertaken bythe PRC side (Coal Science Research Institute) and the Japanese side(NEDO). The small continuous test facility to be offered by Japan isintended to obtain a liquefied product by directly hydrogenating a slurryof coal in oil formed under high temperature and pressure. The coal isprocessed at a rate of 0.1 t/d on a dry coal basis. Conclusions obtainedfrom the tests performed by 1984 are as follows: on Bei-su coal (Shantong),there is no great difference for conversion ratio and oil yield by addingsulfur and so the addition of sulfur is unnecessary; and the PRC coalstested up till now are unsuitable for liquefaction. 2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
