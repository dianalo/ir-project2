The devaluation -- long requested by major exporting industries -- will make Brazil's exports cheaper and more competitive. In the first quarter of this year, the country's trade surplus plunged to $526 million from $2.46 billion in the same period of last year.    This disastrous trade slump, which started in the second half of last year as a consumer boom diverted exports and sucked in imports, was an important factor in Brazil's decision to declare a debt moratorium on Feb. 20. Mr. Bresser Pereira has made clear he feels a surplus of at least $8 billion this year is a necessary basis for negotiations with commercial banks to resolve the debt conflict.    The devaluation, which set the cruzado at a rate of 27.5 to the dollar, was smaller than some people had urged. It appeared to be an attempt to stimulate exports without steeply increasing the price of imports, which might have prompted a new inflationary spiral.    It appeared certain that the central bank would continue its policy -- sometimes known as a &quot;crawling peg&quot; -- of daily minidevaluations, which had already reduced the value of the cruzado by over 50% since November.    Earlier in the day, Mr. Bresser Pereira had prepared for the devaluation by saying that it was essential to revive the country's slumping trade performance. He warned that if Brazil failed to do so it could risk losing its last source of credit.    In a Brazilian television interview, Mr. Bresser Pereira said, &quot;As far as our interest moratorium goes, if we don't obtain a trade surplus of $6 billion to $6.5 billion, we are going to have to carry out a moratorium against official banks, too -- which would be absurd because the official banks are (still) lending us money.&quot; He was referring to governmental lenders and multilateral lending agencies. In February, Brazil declared a moratorium on commercial debt.    In the interview and other statements, the minister stressed that Brazil would seek to revive its trade performance, and that negotiations with banks for a settlement on Brazil's commercial debt moratorium would be &quot;actively pursued.&quot;    Mr. Bresser Pereira also said that the country was halving its growth target for this year to between 3% and 3.5% from 7% and that cuts in federal spending, particularly on subsidies, would be applied.    &quot;With this plan it should be possible to improve the balance of payments and stabilize inflation. It will also be possible to reestablish a dialogue with the international financial community,&quot; he said. Inflation has soared to close to 400% a year.    The February suspension covered interest payments on an estimated $67 billion of medium-term and long-term foreign bank debt. Most of the rest of Brazil's $108 billion foreign debt is owed to official lenders.    The new minister quickly moved to place a former colleague from the Sao Paulo state government in the key position of central bank governor. He named Fernando Milliet, former president of the Sao Paulo state bank Banespa, as the new governor, replacing Francisco Gros, who was in that post just two months. </TEXT></DOC>
