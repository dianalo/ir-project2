Deskpro 386, hasallowed the lab to determine the origin of oil spills more easily.andP;  Thesystem points out relationships in the data that would not be evident whenanalyzed manually.andM;With IXL, Hendrick said she can enter the information for each oil spillcase, including what the oil types were, what the analytical results were foreach analytical method, and what the chemist had judged the outcome of thecase to be.andM;Hendrick uses IXL to find out in a more systematic way the results of thecase and what results of each analytical method will support that outcome.andO;With IXL, it became easier to determine which method is most useful in eachcase, she said.andM;James Brown, an oil industry consultant in Texas who used the program onlarge oil databases for the Energy Department, said the system works well.andM;&quot;It would have taken someone years of experience and a good deal of luck tomake these discoveries from our geological data, but the program found themvery quickly.&quot;andM;C.andP;  Nathan Skinner, a forestry technician with the U.S.andP;  Forest Service inRedding, Calif., uses IXL on a Compaq Computer Corp. Deskpro 386 to helppredict the damage potential of a particular area of forest.andM;IXL has allowed the Forest Service to reduce the possibility of intense firesin California forests, he said.andM;The information generated by IXL gave Forest Service management an idea ofhow different areas would react to fire and what preventive measures could betaken to curb the damage caused, Skinner said.andM;The package is $7,500 for VMS and $490 for MS-DOS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
