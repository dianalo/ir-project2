(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Food and Drug Administration was toldThursday that home AIDS-test kits are safe and could save thousandsof lives, but the agency questioned whether the test manufacturerscould provide adequate counseling and privacy.   At a daylong hearing at the National Institutes of Health, thedeveloper of an AIDS home-testing kit that failed to win FDAapproval criticized the agency's decision, saying it was the resultof politics, not scientific judgment.   ``Untold thousands have become infected (with the AIDS virus)simply because there's no AIDS home test available,'' said ElliottJ. Millenson, a Rockville, Md., consultant who formed a company todevelop and sell a blood-collection kit.   ``So long as politics _ not science _ guides government actionon AIDS, people will die needlessly,'' he said.   The FDA has been reluctant to approve AIDS home-testing kitsbecause of concern over whether people can safely draw their ownblood and ship samples safely to a lab for testing and whether thesamples can remain viable during shipping. They also are concernedabout whether testers can assure confidentiality and whether testsuppliers can provide adequate counseling, especially for those whotest positive for the deadly virus.   The agency last year rejected Millenson's proposed home-testingkit and said it would consider for approval only tests designed foruse by medical professionals in traditional health care settings.   Paul Parkman, director of the FDA's Center for BiologicsEvaluation and Research, who conducted the hearing, said the agencywill continue to consider evidence on the home-testing issue, butadded, ``I don't see there's been a lot of change'' since the FDA'sdecision a year ago.   Millenson said the FDA ``has refused to study the evidence''that backs up his claim that the test his company developed issafe, effective and would incorporate adequate education andcounseling of those using it.   Millenson's home-testing kit included a device for drawingblood, a crush-proof shipping container for blood samples and adetailed instruction booklet. Users would draw their own blood,send the sample in a pre-paid shipping envelope to a laboratory andbe informed of the results by telephone by trained health-careprofessionals, he said.   Howard Markman, a Denver psychologist who was a consultant forMillenson's project, dismissed the FDA's fears that telephonecounseling for those who test positive for the lethal virus willnot be adequate. He said studies have shown that telephonecounseling has effects comparable to face-to-face counseling.   Markman criticized the FDA's resistance to home testing for AIDSand said the agency appears to be saying that ``if this is out ofthe hands of the medical community, that's not good.''   ``It makes me wonder whether there's a turf issue that's ahidden agenda,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
