The Nymex, the world's premier crude-oil futures market, had been in active talks with the IPE on the proposed link since late summer, and London traders had awaited the hook-up eagerly. The London exchange's chief executive officer, Peter Wildblood, said he was surprised by Nymex's move, adding that he believes the decision will prove to be &quot;mistaken.&quot;    The Nymex board voted unanimously against the link at a special meeting Wednesday night.    Under the plan, the Nymex's West Texas Intermediate futures and options would have been traded on the IPE floor prior to the opening of Nymex trading each day.    Rosemary T. McFadden, Nymex president, said the exchange is still interested in expanding internationally. But she said the exchange will instead pursue its previously announced studies of night trading and electronic trading, and of possibly expanding its number of contracts. &quot;Looking at it in terms of Nymex's goals and the Nymex perspective, we felt this alternative didn't best fit our needs.&quot;    Ms. McFadden noted that if the IPE link had been started and didn't succeed, &quot;it'd be a lot harder&quot; to break the link than to quit something like night trading if that didn't work out.    The New York link with the IPE, the only other exchange actively trading energy futures, would have cost about $1.5 million to $2 million to start and about $1.5 million a year in operating costs, exchange officials said.    Mr. Wildblood said his exchange &quot;learned of the Nymex decision with regret -- not to say a little surprise in view of the very positive way negotiations had progressed.&quot; He added that the IPE believed such a link would have benefited the world oil trade.    Peter Gignoux, manager of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s international energy desk in London, and an adviser to the IPE on the proposed link, said traders there were disappointed at news of the Nymex's decision. He said that the London market had been looking forward to trading the New York crude futures contracts and that traders there were under the impression that &quot;it was 75% a done deal.&quot;    This is the second time this month that the Nymex, the U.S.'s No. 3 futures exchange, has disappointed another exchange in a proposed joint project. On Jan. 6, the exchange withdrew from a highly touted, $600 million new home for New York's five commodity exchanges, a project that the Commodity Exchange, or Comex, had pushed strongly. The Nymex cited New York's negative real estate environment in the wake of the stock crash for its withdrawal from that venture.    Said Shearson's Mr. Gignoux in London: &quot;Unanimity on futures exchanges is hard to find.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
