Indeed, only a selectiveproduction method taking into account the geological heterogeneitiesof the reservoir will enable high production and recovery rates. Thispaper presents results concerning three stages of the methodology ofselective completion design, i.e., procedures and equipment for cementingor setting external casing packers, methods of reservoir evaluation inorder to describe heterogeneities and models to optimize the flow ratedistribution according to these heterogeneities.</TEXT></DOC>
