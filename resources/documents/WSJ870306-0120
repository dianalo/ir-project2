In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Halcyon said it holds stock and options equivalent to 726,700 Purolator common shares, assuming exercise of the options.    The stake includes 201,800 shares purchased from Feb. 3 through March 2 at $28.689 to $34.81 a share and options purchased on Feb. 27 to buy 50,000 shares, the filing said. Halcyon paid $75,350 to acquire the options, which are exercisable at $34.50 a share.    Purolator, a package-delivery company, is based in Basking Ridge, N.J.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Purolator closed at $34.625, unchanged.    As previously reported, Purolator's directors recently agreed to a leveraged buyout proposal made by a management-led group to acquire the company for about $268 million in cash and securities.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
