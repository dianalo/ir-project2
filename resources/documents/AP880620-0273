IBM's announcement came the same day that Houston-based CompaqComputer Corp., its archrival in PCs, announced a pair of personalcomputers using the speedy 80386 microprocessor from Intel Corp.   Compaq said one of its models, the Deskpro 386-25, will be thefastest personal computer available in the world. But IBM respondedthat it will take the lead when its fastest model, announcedearlier this month, becomes generally available in August orSeptember.   IBM's trade-in program will begin July 1 and end Aug. 31,although an extension is possible, said Bill Lyons, IBM's generalmanager of Personal System-2 merchandising.   The trade-in program is for the United States only and willapply to any member of the original line of PCs, including the PC,XT, AT, PCjr and PC Portable, as long as it is in good workingorder. It also includes monitors, but not other peripherals.   IBM estimates 4.5 million of the old line of personal computershave been sold in the United States and about 6 million worldwide.The company has shipped worldwide more than 2 million of the newPS-2 line, which was introduced in April 1987.   IBM said the trade-ins are available only through authorizeddealers who choose to participate. The dealers will be free todecide how much to pay for returned personal computers, but IBMwill support the price by guaranteeing payments to dealers.   Payments to dealers could range from $100 or less for anoriginal PC or PCjr to $1,000 for a recent-vintage AT, Lyons said.Dealers also will be reimbursed for handling and transportationcosts.   The returned personal computers will be resold through dealersand brokers in used PCs, IBM said.   Lyons said he was not concerned that the trade-in program wouldrelease a flood of older personal computers onto the market anddepress demand for the new machines.   ``I think it's a way to gain excitement over the summer and toget people to take a fresh look at our PS-2s,'' Lyons said.   About half a million used IBM PCs are placed with new usersannually, either by transfer within organizations or throughresale, Lyons said.   In addition to its top-of-the-line Deskpro 386-25, Compaqannounced a Deskpro 386s that is much cheaper than other computersin its class because it uses a special new version of Intel's 80386microprocessor.   Lyons said IBM is ``assessing'' the new Intel chip, but does notwant to introduce a computer built around it until it is sure thechips will be available in sufficient volume.</TEXT></DOC>
