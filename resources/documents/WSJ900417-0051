Heinz Co. (Starkist brand), three canners with a hugeshare of the market capitulated to environmentalists whodemanded they quit netting the big tuna that often swim underthe lovable water mammals.   Greenpeace and its cohorts had launched a boycott of tunato protest the deaths of dolphins caught up in the fishingboats' nets. Heinz, after what it called marketing studies,said its customers would be willing to pay extra for youngeryellowfin, which don't frolic with dolphins, or for biggertuna caught in oceans where the mysterious symbiosis isn'tobserved.</LP><TEXT>   In line with its newfound consciousness, Heinz now wantsthe government to put a lid on imported tuna ruled&quot;dolphin-unsafe.&quot; Hmmm. Protectionist the dolphins.   Come to think of it, even without the lid on imports, theinstant consensus among competitors to offer only more costlytuna might excite some curiosity among the reinvigoratedtrustbusters at the Federal Trade Commission. After all, evenconsumers who haven't turned green will be laying out thegreen.   One group that has more than curiosity at stake is theU.S. tuna fleet, which mostly sails out of San Diego. Itunloads the bulk of its catch in Puerto Rico and AmericanSamoa. If fishermen can't find an economic way to make aliving under the new rules -- and their spokesmen say theymay not be able to, given how the loss of nets will cut thecatch in what is already a difficult business -- it's goingto further shrink a fleet that's already diminished bytwo-thirds since 1981. How many workers will now suffer atHeinz's clean hands is a guess.   Many Americans may care more about porpoises thanfishermen. If so, then they especially should realize themagnitude of progress in tuna-netting practices, gains thatmay be stalled or lost by last week's action. Since theJournal's Roy Harris Jr. detailed the development ofdolphin-sparing tuna techniques in a front-page article 13years ago, the kill rate has been about halved. Last year thetoll in the U.S.-fished region was under 13,000. Half thetime the boats drop one of their purse-like nets, they killnone of the average 650 dolphins swept up. The Marine MammalProtection Act of 1972, combined with the fact that dolphinkills only detract from tuna yields, has spurred the U.S. toremarkable achievements.   In the international marketplace, love for Flipper isn'tuniversal. Greenpeace is not usually so effective when itgoes calling on Mexico City or Seoul. So now the Pacificregion off the Americas may belong to foreign fishingvessels, who are likely to kill more dolphins than the SanDiego boats they replace.   If the industry is correct in saying that younger tunawill now be fished out before they can reproduce, theagreement will also be bad for the tuna. We might face adepletion scare such as one that prompted tuna-conservationcontrols on the West Coast fleet 20 years ago. Saving thetuna will come second to saving the dolphin, but it willcome, and kids may then be condemned to cheese sandwiches. Wewonder what cows would think of that.</TEXT></DOC>
