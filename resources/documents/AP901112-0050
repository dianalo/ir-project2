TWA chairman Carl Icahn said late Sunday he had proposedoffering about $150 million in cash plus securities with a facevalue of $300 million for struggling Pan Am.   Icahn said in a telephone interview that Pan Am Chairman ThomasPlaskett had asked him to make an offer in case Pan Am's talks withUAL Corp. fail. Pan Am has proposed selling UAL important routesbetween New York and London as part of a $400 million deal.   Although TWA is considered healthier than Pan Am, both have beenhurt by rising fuel prices since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwaitand fewer passengers since the economy started weakening.   If TWA buys Pan Am, duplicated routes like those to London'sHeathrow airport would be sold, Pan Am said. TWA and Pan Am are theonly two U.S. airlines flying into Heathrow.   Icahn's proposal, contained in a letter delivered to Plaskettlate Friday, proposed Pan Am shareholders receive $1 per share incash and securities with a face value of $2 per share. Thesecurities, either preferred stock or promissary notes, could bringdifferent market prices.   Pan Am's stock closed at $1.62{ Friday on the New York StockExchange; in early trading today, it rose 12{ cents to $1.75.   Pan Am said in a statement it was still working on the routesale to United, but the deal could be called off if not completedby Wednesday.   United spokesman Joe Hopkins wouldn't comment Sunday on the TWAproposal.   Icahn's letter also proposed buying the Pan Am Shuttle, whichflies between Boston, New York and Washington, by the end of theyear. TWA's proposal to buy the rest of the company is open throughFriday.   The Wall Street Journal reported recently that Pan Am's pilotsmight be willing to pay $150 million to $200 million for theshuttle alone. Subtracting other elements of Pan Am's deal withUnited, the London routes would be worth about $290 million.   TWA last month announced 430 layoffs from its work force of33,000 to cope with rising jet fuel prices and the economicdownturn. TWA also said it would stop hiring and training newpilots and flight attendants.   TWA, based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., earned $103.4 million in thesecond quarter of the year, but that included one-time gains fromthe sales of assets totalling $160.2 million. In the second quarterof 1989, the airline lost $4.4 million.   Earlier this month, Pan Am, based in New York, cited blamedrising jet fuel costs for a loss of $29.1 million, or 19 cents pershare, during the third quarter. In the same period last year theairline lost $18 million, or 12 cents a share.</TEXT></DOC>
