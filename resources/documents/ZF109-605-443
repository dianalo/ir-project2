Itcleans up a lot of the stuff we didn't like,&quot; said Sheldon Laube, nationaldirector of information and technology for accounting firm Price-Waterhousein New York, one of the first major Notes customers.andM;One of the most prominent 2.0 enhancements, sources and potential users said,is Notes' support for graphics files of unlimited size.andP;  Previously, graphicsfiles were limited to 64K bytes -- not nearly enough capacity to store andtransmit full-screen graphics images in the Notes environment.andM;&quot;We are really excited about the possibility of better graphics,&quot; said BrianPlackis, an applications specialist for MCI Telecommunications Corp. inDallas.andM;New communications capabilities are designed to optimize the replication ofdata among disparate Notes servers -- a key feature that provides redundantdata storage should one server fail, sources said.andM;The new release also will streamline interaction between remote users and theservers: It will provide laptop users dialing into Notes with many of thedesktop-organization features available to local Notes users.andM;Notes 2.0 will integrate Microsoft Corp.'s Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)technology, allowing users to integrate Lotus' communications software withother DDE-compatible applications, sources said.andP;  For example, users runninga spreadsheet that incorporates DDE will be able to call up a spreadsheetfile stored in Notes and manipulate that file without leaving Lotus' networkprogram.andM;Lotus, of Cambridge, Mass., is not adding to the upgrade the full-textretrieval and relational database capabilities that some users haverequested, nor will the company address Notes' fixed pricing structure,sources said.andP;  Although many users have expressed interest in Notes, othershave been put off by the company's $62,500, 200-user entry point.andP;  Notes iscurrently installed in about 50 sites.andM;While Notes remains Lotus' only major network software offering, the companyis working on longer-term projects to further wend its way into the networkapplications arena, according to sources and company officials.andM;Development is under way on &quot;collaborative spreadsheet&quot; technology designedto automate the distribution of spreadsheet data among multiple users,sources said.andP;  A product that exploits the technology is at least one yearaway, they said.andM;In the PIM arena, Lotus is looking to extend the capabilities of Agenda withcollaborative features such as calendaring across a network, companyofficials said last week.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
