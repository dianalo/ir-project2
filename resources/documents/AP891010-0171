The State Department said 42 Panamanians had been admitted onhumanitarian grounds. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidthe group included ``coup members and their families.''   The Panamanians ``had reason to believe the Noriega regime wouldseek them out for persecution, either because of allegedinvolvement in the Oct. 3 coup attempt, or because of their familyrelationship with the alleged coup plotters,'' the State Departmentsaid.   The group is believed to include Adela Bonilla Giroldi, widow ofthe coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi. She was accompanied bymembers of her family.   Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be the highest-ranking coupparticipant to escape capture, also was reported in the UnitedStates.   Fitzwater refused to identify any of the refugees, saying thepublishing of their pictures might result in their deaths.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service will interview thePanamanians on Friday, said INS spokesman Verne Jervis. ``I assumesome will ask for asylum'' while others may cite some other legalbasis for remaining in this country, he said.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said thePanamanians are being received by the U.S. Catholic Conference,which provides assistance to refugees and people given asylum. U.S.officials in Miami are debriefing them.   Mark Franken of the U.S. Catholic Conference said from New Yorkthat his group assured the Panamanians that their whereabouts wouldnot be divulged.   ``Those that have relatives somewhere in the United States, wewill try to reunite them,'' he said. ``Those that don't, we willtry to find resettlement sites around the country. These peoplecame in virtually with what they have on their backs.''   Meanwhile, the Pentagon said there had been dissension andconfusion among the coup leaders and an argument about what to dowith Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said it was clear that Giroldi``had no intention, ever,'' of turning Noriega over to the UnitedStates.   However, Williams said an unnamed officer taking part in thecoup insisted that Noriega be given to the United States and arguedwith Giroldi.   Williams said the officer eventually gave up the dispute andleft the military headquarters because he feared that Noriega hador would become aware of his opinions.   Williams said the officer was among those who met later withU.S. Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, second in command of U.S. forces inthe area.   Later the Pentagon issued a statement saying that ``there was nomention to Gen. Cisneros that there had been any internal debate''among the coup plotters.   The spokesman said it isn't clear to what extent those claimingto have held Noriega for several hours really had him under theircontrol.   ``You have someone who was one of the coup plotters saying,`Well, we ought to' turn Noriega over to the United States. Hedoesn't prevail, and he leaves. And he communicates (to the UnitedStates) that the people holding Gen. Noriega still have nointention of turning him over to the United States,'' Williams said.   ``There was never a request for us to come and get him, theynever offered him to us.''   Fitzwater acknowledged that he had erred last week by sayingU.S. troops were deployed in Panama at two key points merely tosafeguard Americans and to protect the Panama Canal.   In fact, the United States had been asked by the rebels tostation the forces to block reinforcements for Noriega.   Fitzwater said he had not been aware of the facts when he madehis original statement. Fitzwater also had said the United Stateshad only third-party contact with the rebels before the coup, when,in fact, U.S. officials were in touch directly with Giroldi.   Fitzwater said he didn't know if President Bush had been awareof the direct discussion with Giroldi.   Nevertheless, Fitzwater defended the administration's handlingof the matter and the decision not to provide U.S. military forceto the rebels.   Amid charges that the administration was operating in a void,Fitzwater said Bush ``had plenty of information, he made thedecision that he thought was best and the decision we still thinkis right. We don't have any questioning about the correctness ofthat decision.''   Fitzwater seemed to back away from administration complaintsabout congressional interference in foreign affairs, particularlyin Panama.   ``We don't have any specific complaints,'' he said.   Fitzwater also said the United States had no plan for additionaleconomic sanctions against Panama.   Meanwhile, it was announced in Panama that John Bushnell, a30-year Foreign Service veteran, would replace John Maisto ascharge d'affaires, the acting head of the U.S. embassy.   Bushnell has served in Argentina, Colombia, Switzerland and inthe Dominican Republic during the dispatch of U.S. troops there in1965.   Ambassador Arthur Davis was ordered home in May.</TEXT></DOC>
