The average electron energy at the position of the blood samplewas about 5 MeV. For the irradiation temperature 10 different valuesbetween 4/sup 0/C and 37/sup 0/C were chosen. For comparison blood samplesfrom the same donator were irradiated according to an already known techniqueat the same temperature interval with 150 kV X-radiation. The yield ofdicentric chromosomes with electron irradiation showed a similar, S-formedtemperature dependence like the one with x-radiation. The lymphocytesshowed with both radiation types as well an S-shaped temperature dependenceof the total of all acentric fragments as well as of the so-called extra-acentricfragments, which do not associate with dicentric chromosomes, and offragments of cells without structural chromosome aberrations.</TEXT></DOC>
