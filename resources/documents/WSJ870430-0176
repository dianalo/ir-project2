The information used to make college-aid decisions is pretty straightforward, consisting of data provided by the family on salaries, savings, taxes and so forth. But how the numbers are evaluated is apparently anything but clear to many college-bound students and their parents.    &quot;The biggest surprise is that their assets are included&quot; in the calculations, says Haskell Rhett, a vice president of the New York-based College Board. Although officials say they don't expect parents to sell their home or business to pick up the tab for college, they say parents must be willing to sell investments, dip into retirement savings and take out a second mortgage, if necessary.    The College Board's College Scholarship Service division is one of three organizations that make the preliminary decisions for colleges and other groups that give scholarships on student-aid requests. The largest of the three, it processed about 2.8 million financial-aid applications this year. A million more were processed by American College Testing Program of Iowa City, Iowa. National Computer Systems Inc., also in Iowa City, processed 2 million applications for Pell Grants and other federal student-aid programs.    Using uniform formulas and methodology agreed on in 1974 and updated annually, these organizations come up with basic estimates of how much students and their families can afford to pay. These figures are then adjusted by the colleges on the basis of their individual policies, resources and desire for a student.    A key factor is the equity of the family home or homes. &quot;If you've got two families, one sitting in a $300,000 home and one in a more modest situation, with a mortgage, the first family has greater financial strength, and we have to take that into account,&quot; says Karl Furstenberg, director of admissions and financial aid for Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn.    The value of a family-owned business is also taken into account. For instance, a business with a net worth of $60,000 is counted as contributing an additional $24,000 annually to the funds a family could call on to pay college expenses. A business with a net worth of $100,000 is judged to contribute $44,000 -- that's $24,000 plus 50% of the net worth in excess of $60,000.    Mom and Dad's retirement nest egg also isn't sacrosanct. But aid officials do give older parents a break. The amount of savings that's considered available is prorated on the basis of the age of the older parent. The thinking, says Margaret DeanColeman, director of financial-aid services for American College Testing, is that younger parents will have more years to save for retirement.    After the family's resources are added up, subtractions are made for expenses, including a living allowance. In the case of a family of four with one child in college, for instance, this allowance figures $12,890 for most outlays other than those for housing, medical expenses and taxes.    Parents already cash-strapped by high-school and grammar-school tuitions for their younger children may be in for a shock: While the annual tuition at a private high school can easily total $5,000 or more, the college-aid formulas allow only $3,150 a year for educating a child in a private grammar or secondary school.    &quot;We feel private secondary education is more of a discretionary expense,&quot; says Mr. Furstenberg of Wesleyan.    What's left of the family resources after allowable expenses are deducted is called &quot;adjusted available income.&quot; A percentage of this amount -- ranging from 22% for families with adjusted available incomes of $7,500 or less to 47% for those with adjusted available incomes of more than $15,101 -- is the amount the family is expected to contribute toward its child's college education. If the family contribution exceeds college costs, no aid is given.    College officials recognize that the system isn't perfect. Says Ollie Bryant, director of financial aid for New York University, &quot;We make assumptions that every family's spending patterns are the same and that every family is willing to make a sacrifice, and that just isn't true.&quot; Still, she adds, only 2% of those awarded aid by N.Y.U. make a formal appeal to have their applications reevaluated. </TEXT></DOC>
