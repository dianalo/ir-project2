Those agreeing to vote in favor of the proposal control more than 50% of Seton's stock. Seton tans and distributes leather, is a supplier to medical-products makers and produces chemicals and coatings.    Seton in March received the bid, led by its chairman and chief executive officer, Philip D. Kaltenbacher. Mr. Kaltenbacher owns about 30% of the company's 7,690,000 common shares. At the offered price, purchase of the remaining shares would cost about $85 million.    Seton shares closed at $15.375, bid, in American Stock Exchange trading. </TEXT></DOC>
