The transaction comes almost a year after Mr. Grindle made an initial buyout offer of $4.75 a share. Since then, he raised the bid significantly in response to higher offers by stockholder and investor groups.    Under Mr. Grindle's buyout plan, Ealing, as of Friday, merged with a legal entity known as Ealing Merger Corp. Ealing holders will receive $8 a share for each common share. This doesn't include Mr. Grindle or corporations that he owns.    Before the leveraged buyout, Mr. Grindle owned 136,000 of the company's 1.35 million common shares outstanding. Ealing, which makes scientific and optical instruments, is the surviving corporation in the merger.    Mr. Grindle, who founded the company 31 years ago, said he wanted to buy Ealing &quot;to restructure it in a way that needs to be done without short-term earnings considerations for the next two or three years.&quot; He said he will restructure the company in a &quot;drastic&quot; way through trimming businesses and reorganizing operations. &quot;It's an old sleepy company and needs to be shaken up and put together again,&quot; he said.    In 1985, Ealing had net income of $1.9 million, or $1.48 a share, on sales of $13.5 million. Earnings included a pre-tax gain of $2.77 million from the sale of shares of Ealing Electro-Optics PLC in Britain. </TEXT></DOC>
