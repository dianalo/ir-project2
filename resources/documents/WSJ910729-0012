Henoticed the Japanese and Americans started including him andhis company researchers in on important discussions atsemiconductor seminars. Japanese trade magazines began doingarticles on the upstart. &quot;People wanted to know what we weredoing,&quot; he says.   Samsung Electronics did what, only three years ago, no oneoutside Samsung thought possible. It leaped into the ranks ofthe big-league semiconductor makers when it began producing16-megabit computer chips, matching the production schedulesof the big Japanese chip makers.</LP><TEXT>   Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., and maybe evenGoldstar Electron Co., are a year behind Samsung. Industryobservers are impressed with the Korean industry's ability tocatch up on the 16-bit memory chip, a fingernail-sized bit ofsilicon capable of holding the entire contents of &quot;Crime andPunishment.&quot;   But there is still doubt-harbored even by Koreans -- thatKorean companies can ever go much beyond the mass-producedmemory devices, which are the brains of computers.Increasingly, the product life cycle of memories are gettingshorter, prices tend to drop sharply and investment costs arerising quickly. Korean semiconductor makers, includingSamsung, need to sprint to more sophisticated and higherprofit-margin semiconductors, such as custom-made chips forconsumer products or the reduced-instruction set computingmicroprocessors that are used in computer workstations. &quot;Theyare looking for what is next,&quot; says Son Jong Hyun, generalmanager of Dataquest Inc., the San Jose, Calif.,semiconductor market research firm. &quot;But they haven't foundit.&quot;   Executives of the Korean companies say they need the helpof overseas chip makers to do that. They are watching chipmakers in Europe, the U.S. and Japan link up into strategicalliances and see themselves the odd men out. &quot;It isdifficult for a newcomer. We want to be a joint partner,&quot;says Mr. Lee of Samsung Electronics. &quot;Unfortunately, we haveno strategic alliances.&quot;   Han Chang Seock, semiconductor marketing director forHyundai Electronics, notes that in 1984 it cost $30 millionto begin making the one-megabit chip. To make the 16-megabitchip it will cost $300 million. To make the 256-megabit chip,it take an investment of at least $1 billion. &quot;We want tomake a consortium with another company, Japanese or U.S., itdoesn't matter,&quot; says Mr. Han.   There is some interest from foreign companies, but not onthe scale Korean companies need or want. For instance,Samsung is making RISC chips for computer workstations forHewlett-Packard Co. Hitachi Ltd. of Japan is sharing oldfour-megabit chip technology with Goldstar Electron. Park HeeJoon, head of Motorola Inc.'s operations in Korea, saysgreater cooperation isn't out of the question. &quot;It is apeople discipline issue, so the Korea companies have a lot tooffer. What they accomplished in memories, there is no reasonthey can't accomplish in logic circuits,&quot; he says.   Korean companies have a toe-hold in the semiconductormarket with almost a 2.4% share of world-wide sales. They aremajor producers of one-megabit and four-megabit memories,holding about 10% of that specialized market. And they make awide gamut of integrated circuits and other electronic parts.But they are almost all high-volume products with broadapplications in computers or consumer electronics.   To get to more sophisticated customized chips, where themoney will be, the Korean companies may need to go it aloneas they did with memory chips. The first step would be tobuild a captive domestic market for those chips and use theprofits and expertise to launch sales world-wide. The upshot:The companies probably will be gnawing away at the 23% marketshare that American companies hold in the $2.1 billion Koreanmarket. That runs the risk of making American companiesadversaries rather than allies.   That is likely to happen because the American companiesare strong in the computer, telecommunications and industrialfields, while the Japanese hold the market for semiconductorsthat go into consumer appliances such as videocassetterecorders, stereos or televisions. Japanese companies inventthe electronic consumer appliances and design their chipsinto it. Korean companies, playing catch-up with consumersappliances, use the Japanese designs, and of course, thechips giving Japanese a solid market share of about 38%. Itis easier to pick off a standard chip set used in a personalcomputer clone.   Says Mr. Son, &quot;The Korean product mix is shifting towardsindustrial and computer parts from consumer appliance parts.&quot;Already, Korean domestic market share is growing, at theexpense of American and European makers. The Korean marketshare grew to 29% last year from 26% in 1987, according toDataquest figures. The U.S. share slipped to 23% from almost25% of the market. The European makers' share slid to 7% fromalmost 11%. It is a trend that the analysts say willcontinue. U.S. industry and government officials say they arewatching the situation, but aren't concerned yet.   It is a long shot for Korea to make the transition. Butthe companies are counting on its burgeoning supply ofelectronic engineers -- 4,000 of them won degrees last year.It has lots of engineers while the U.S. and Japan faceshortages. Samsung hired nearly 1,000 of them.   There is near agreement that if any Korean company willmake the transition to sophisticated chips designed forspecific use, it will be Samsung Electronics, a unit of thegiant Samsung Group. The company began making semiconductorsin 1974, but didn't begin a program of heavy investment andresearch and development until 1983. &quot;In 17 years, weeducated many engineers and technicians,&quot; says Mr. Lee ofSamsung. &quot;Now that expense is paying off.&quot;   It is spending about 3% of its $1.3 billion insemiconductor revenue on research this year. &quot;The motivationhas been to catch up,&quot; says Mr. Lee, who sometimes sports a&quot;Take-Off II&quot; button on his jacket to motivate staff. &quot;Nowthe thinking should be getting to a leading position, not afollowing position.&quot;   Hyundai Electronics, a unit of the sprawling HyundaiGroup, says it will catch up with Samsung. It will beproducing a million 4-megabit chips a month and hopes to getto 3 million. A 16-megabit chip may be ready for shipment atthe end of 1992. &quot;We don't want to be first for the timebeing,&quot; says Mr. Han, the marketing director. &quot;No. 2 isenough of a feat. We are trying to catch up.&quot; The grouprecently designated the electronics unit a core company, sothat it faces no credit constraints imposed by the Koreangovernment on other Hyundai units.   Goldstar Electron, a part of the big Lucky Goldstar Group,refuses to discuss its semiconductors for fear of attractingthe attention of European trade officials. &quot;They might filedumping charges against us,&quot; says a spokesman. Hitachi,facing production constraints in Japan, is helping a recentlystreamlined Goldstar Electron build the four-megabit chip andthe tie-up has been a boon for Goldstar, which had laggedbehind its local rivals. Local news reports say productionwill soon reach 500,000 units a month.</TEXT></DOC>
