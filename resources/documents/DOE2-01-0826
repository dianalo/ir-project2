For both the ketones and the alcoholsa prominent photoproduct is the aldehyde. Typical acceptors used in thesereactions include various polypyridyl ruthenium (II) complexes and thioindigo.For the ruthenium (II) complexes quantum efficiencies are in the range0.1-0.2 for rigorously degassed solutions and up to 0.7 for oxygenatedsamples. The one-electron reduced ruthenium (II) complex is observedas both a transient and permanent photoproduct in the reaction; howeverthe stoichiometric relationship between aldehyde produced and metal complexions reduced is much greater than one. Transient photolysis shows thatthe initially-formed reduced ruthenium complex is oxidized in a bimolecularprocess with k=3.8 x 10{sup 7} m{sup -1} S{sup -1} and that there issome net reduced complex which is not reoxidized. For thioindigo as theexcited donor the efficiencies of both dye reduction and aldehyde productionare high and comparable; here again the efficiencies of aldehyde productionare higher in the presence of oxygen than in rigorously degassed solutions;this can be attributed, at least in part, to the role of oxygen in regeneratingthe light-absorbing acceptor. Results obtained to date are consistentwith at least two mechanisms for fragmentation of the radical cationformed by oxidation of the amino alcohol.</TEXT></DOC>
