McCarthy and 29 members of the U.S. Embassy staff were evacuatedfrom Beirut Wednesday after a Christian commander in the embattledcity had voiced threatening remarks.   McCarthy spoke briefly with reporters when he arrived at DullesInternational Airport on a flight from Frankfurt, West Germany.   ``Any embassy has to rely on the host government authorities toprovide protection,'' he said. ``When we felt that that wasn't beingprovided any more, we had to leave.''   Asked whether the United States was washing its hands of Beirut,McCarthy replied:   ``Never. We're very interested in what's happening in Lebanon. Wehave a strong attachment to the Lebanese people.''   The ambassador was asked whether the evacuation of him and theembassy staff would have any impact on efforts to free Westernhostages believed held in Beirut.   McCarthy said that while the U.S. Embassy was located inChristian East Beirut, the hostages are believed to be held captivein Moslem West Beirut. Movements of Americans assigned to theembassy had been restricted to East Beirut.   For that reason, he said, ``our absence from Beirut willunfortunately not really impact significantly on what we know aboutthe hostages.''   The envoy was met at the airport was met by his wife, Marija, andtheir 11-year-old daughter, Julia.   Earlier Thursday, the State Department renewed its allegationthat a Christian commander in Lebanon had threatened to take 20Americans hostage.   ``I view it as a threat,'' spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler saidof General Michel Aoun's remark to the French newspaper Figaro thattaking hostages was evidently the way to get U.S. attention.   Aoun had complained in the interview that the United States wasnot paying enough attention to the war in his country betweenChristians and Moslems backed by Syria.   In reply, Ms. Tutwiler said the Bush administration had taken anactive role in seeking a settlement.   She said President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIhad called for a cease-fire and U.S. ambassadors and governmentofficials in the Middle East were working toward that end.   ``I think we have been engaged,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.</TEXT></DOC>
