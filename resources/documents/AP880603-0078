However, a critic of genetic engineering warned that havoc couldresult if altered carp escape into lakes and streams and upsetnature's balance.   Two researchers from Johns Hopkins University here and one fromAuburn University in Alabama injected the genes of rainbow troutinto carp eggs to create a fish that grows one-fifth faster thanother carp and consumes more food.   ``The potential of doing this in other fish could mean billionsof dollars worldwide. If you can get organisms to grow faster andimprove efficiency it will bring down the price to the consumer,''said one of the researchers, Johns Hopkins biology departmentChairman Dennis Powers.   The technique could eventually be applied to catfish farming, amultimillion-dollar-a-year industry for the South, Powers said. Inaddition, if continuing tests on the altered carp succeed, geneticmanipulation could increase fish production in winter months, whenfish grow more slowly.   But genetic engineering critic Jeremy Rifkin said that if thecarp escapes into nature, ``that could dramatically change anddisrupt marine life.''   If the altered genes are transmitted to other generations ``theycould overtake the environment,'' said Rikfin, a Washington-basedlobbyist who is president of the Foundation on Economic Trends.   Powers, however, said that because the fish need substantiallymore food than normal carp they would likely starve if releasedinto the environment rather than being raised at a fish farm.   Powers also said he and his colleagues have to study whether thealtered gene can be passed on to future generations of carp.   Powers, Johns Hopkins molecular biologist Thomas Chen and Auburnfisheries geneticist Rex Dunham have asked the U.S. Department ofAgriculture for permission to release the carp into smallexperimental ponds at Auburn to see how the fish fare outdoors.   The fish would be isolated in the holding ponds, and would notbe allowed to escape into lakes and streams in the preliminarystudy, Powers said.   Rifkin said there were not enough assurances the carp would notescape, and is petitioning USDA to deny the application.   The researchers injected a growth hormone-producing gene intothe just-fertilized eggs of 10,000 carp, but only 20 carp retainedthe trout gene.   Because of that, Dunham said more experiments would have to bedone before he is sure the experiment succeeded.   Chinese scientists proved last year that genes from otheranimals can change physical and chemical processes in fish.   Scientists have successfully mixed genes from different speciesin warm-blooded animals, such as rodents and livestock, and inmicrobes and plants.</TEXT></DOC>
