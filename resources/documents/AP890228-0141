But the task force, moving to ensure the safety of an aginginternational airline fleet, said none of the proposed repairs wasurgent and all could be done over several years' time.   The group, set up the Air Transport Association, which representsmajor U.S. airlines, asked the Federal Aviation Administration toissue a massive ``airworthiness directive'' making mandatorymodifications and replacements recommended in 150 Boeing Co. servicebulletins.   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner applauded the proposaland said the FAA already had begun procedures required to issue themassive airworthiness directive called for by the task force.   The FAA has jurisdiction over planes flown by U.S. carriers.Regulatory bodies in other countries issue the rules under whichthose nations' planes operate.   The transport association estimated that 30 percent to 40 percentof the affected planes fall under FAA jurisdiction.   The proposed work would apply to more than 1,300 Boeing aircraftworldwide at an average cost of $600,000 per plane. A Boeingrepresentative on the task force joined in the unanimous vote tomake his company's recommendations mandatory.   Clyde Kizer, transport association vice president, said theproposed repairs and replacements would be tied to the number oftimes an airliner had taken off and landed and its time in the sky.   Emphasizing that none of the work was considered pressing, Kizertold a news conference, ``There are no dangerous aircraft out thereflying right now.''   Parts affected would include joints, fittings, outside skin andsome structural materials, Kizer said.   ``What we are suggesting,'' he said, ``is that at some point inan aircraft's history it is no longer acceptable just to inspect.''   The FAA now requires airlines to conduct regular inspections ofolder aircraft and, in most cases, to make repairs and changes whenproblems are found.   The task force proposal would mandate the replacement of specificaircraft parts according to how much a plane had been used ratherthan its chronological age.   Kizer said the release of the report, which followed nine monthsof work, had nothing to do with Friday's incident in which ninepeople died after a hole opened in the fuselage of a United Airlines747 over the Pacific Ocean.   Investigators probing the crash are focusing on the possibilityof a cargo door problem that could be related to aging. Kizer saidthe task force proposal covered no work involving cargo doors on747s.   The group, which also includes international aviation experts andU.S. government representatives, began its work partly in responseto an April 1988 incident in which part of the roof of an AlohaAirlines 737 peeled away over Hawaii, sucking a stewardess to herdeath.   The average age of the world's 8,800 airliners is just over 13years, according to Avmark, an aviation appraisal firm. Its latestsurvey, done in July, showed the average U.S. airliner in servicewas 12.67 years old.   Service records of older McDonnell Douglas aircraft _ such asDC-10s, DC-9s and DC-8s _ and aircraft build overseas are also beingstudied by task force committees. They are due to makerecommendations later this year.   Ben Cosgrove, a Boeing vice president who was on the task force,said his company supported the recommendations announced Tuesday.   While aging airliners continue to be safe if properly inspectedand maintained, he said, ``we don't want to continue to inspectthem'' for potential problems, preferring instead that worksuggested in the bulletins be carried out.   Airlines participating in the task force said they did not expectimmediate major expenses in part because they have already done orplanned much of the work voluntarily.   ``We don't anticipate anything over and above what we've alreadyplanned to do,'' said Bob Doll, a United Air Lines vice presidentwho helped draw up the recommendations.   Pan American President Thomas G. Plaskett, who did notparticipate in the task force, said his airline fully supports theproposal. ``Unless we do this, the U.S. fleet is not going to be bigenough to meet the demand,'' he said.   He noted that half the world's airliners are over 20 years oldwhile increased air travel and the growing world demand forairliners is forcing carriers to wait several years for the deliveryof new jets.</TEXT></DOC>
