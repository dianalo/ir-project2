Reservists and National Guard members also tend to come frommilitary families, almost always have at least a high schooldiploma, expect to stay in the reserves because of the pay andpension benefits as well as out of a sense of patriotism, and nowmirror the percentages of women and minorities in the activeforces, the study found.   The survey, entitled simply ``Description of Officers andEnlisted Personnel in the U.S. Selected Reserve: 1986,'' wasreleased late Thursday by the Pentagon.   The Defense Department described it as ``the first comprehensivesurvey'' of reservists it had ever attempted, adding that more than52,000 enlisted personnel and 12,000 officers across the countryhad been queried on their personal backgrounds and satisfactionwith their part-time military work.   The Selected Reserve Forces include the Army National Guard, theAir National Guard, the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine CorpsReserve, Air Force Reserve and Coast Guard Reserve. Those forcesnow include more than 1.1 million men and women, who are expectedto train on active duty for two weeks every year and on one weekenda month.   Stephen M. Duncan, the assistant defense secretary for reserveaffairs, said Thursday the Pentagon intended to use the survey togauge the adequacy of its recruiting and retention policies for thereserves.   According to the survey:</TEXT><TEXT>   _About 62 percent of part-time reserve officers and 47 percentof the enlisted reservists spent time on active duty _ an averageof more than four years for enlisted members and five years forofficers. About three-quarters of the reservists come from familieswith other members who served in the armed forces.   _Once they join up, reservists tend to stick with theircommitment. Part-time enlisted reservists have an average 7 yearsof service with their units, while officers have an average 10.5years of service under their belts.   _The median age for an enlisted member is 29.5, while the medianfor an officer is 37.9.   _Fifty-five percent of the enlisted reservists and 76 percent ofthe officers are married; three-quarters of the married reservistssay their spouse supports their part-time military service.   _Only about 15 percent of the reservists' employers areperceived as having an ``unfavorable'' attitude toward militaryservice.   ``Serving their country was a major contributor to the retentiondecision for 55 percent of the enlisted personnel and 59 percent ofthe officers,'' the study states.   ``Earning credit towards retirement was a major contributor for50 percent of the enlisted personnel and 62 percent of theofficers.''</TEXT></DOC>
