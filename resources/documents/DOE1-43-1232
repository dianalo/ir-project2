<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-1232 </DOCNO><TEXT>The optical and neutral hydrogen data for all spiral and late-type dwarfirregular galaxies in the Virgo Cluster catalog are analyzed. In particular,the continuity of optical properties, hydrogen masses, and dynamicalproperties are examined as functions of morphology and luminosity fromthe largest spirals through the faintest dwarfs (omitting blue compactdwarf galaxies); the effects of environment on H I content; mass segregation;and the Tully-Fisher relations. The spiral plus dwarf sample forms acontinuous but nonhomologous sequence. Indicative dynamical mass-to-lightratios are relatively constant throughout; hydrogen mass-to-light ratiosshow only a slight increase with decreasing luminosity. The Tully-Fisherrelations extend with continuous slope from spirals through dwarfs. Thedwarfs show some evidence of ram-pressure stripping by the intraclustermedium, but as a group do not seem to be stripped more heavily than spirals.There is no evidence of mass segregation even for the very low mass dwarfsversus giant spirals. 88 references.</TEXT></DOC>
