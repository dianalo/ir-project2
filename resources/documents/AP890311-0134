(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A company that markets weapons systems tothe U.S. government and more than 60 other countries has agreed toplead guilty to bribing foreign officials and will pay $1 million inpenalties.   No charges have been filed in the case, but officials of TheVenturian Corp. said Friday that the company's lawyers had made aplea agreement with federal prosecutors after a 1{-year grand juryinvestigation.   The grand jury continues to investigate and could indictofficials at the company, which markets a wide range of weaponssystems including armed patrol boats and accessories for the M16family of military rifles.   In a public statement released Friday, Venturian said its pleaagreement could bar the company from receiving defense contracts andstrip it of export privileges.   Venturian's president Gary Rappaport said in a news release, thatif the government does limit the company's operations, he doesn'tbelieve the restrictions would be in place for a long time.   A ban on defense contracts and exporting could wipe out as muchas 95 percent of Venturian's annual sales, the company statementsaid.   Rappaport said the company agreed to plead guilty to ``put thematter behind us. The acts which were the subject of theinvestigation were isolated instances, and the person allegedlyinvolved is no longer with the company.''   In addition to the bribery charges, the company has agreed toplead guilty to assisting the preparation and filing of false taxreturns and conspiring to violate various federal antifraud laws andthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   The government will require Venturian to pay restitution,penalties and fines totaling $1 million. The guilty pleas areexpected to be lodged late next month.   Venturian, through its subsidiary, Napco International Inc.,sells spare military parts and other equipment to the governments.It had sales of about $33 million and profits of about $900,000 in1987.   Through the first nine months of 1988 Venturian reported lossesof $125,000 on revenues of $23.1 million. Rappaport told Venturian's115 employees that the company has an investment portfolio worthabout $5 million and no debt.   The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime for U.S.companies to bribe foreign officials, and holds the corporationsaccountable even when foreign employees violate company policy bymaking the bribes.</TEXT></DOC>
