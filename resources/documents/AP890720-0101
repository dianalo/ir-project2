It was ``a clear conflict of interest'' for David Milhollan toserve on a policy-making panel while he supervised the immigrationcourts, said Marc Van Der Hout, attorney for eight Los Angeles-areaimmigrants fighting deportation.   Van Der Hout said Milhollan's dual functions prejudiced agovernment case against the immigrants _ seven Palestinians and aKenyan.   In a legal brief, Justice Department lawyers argued that Van DerHout's allegations ``have no relevance'' to his clients' casebecause the Immigration and Naturalization Service, not Milhollan,filed the charges.   Milhollan is director of the Executive Office for ImmigrationReview in Falls Church, Va., which oversees the nation's two dozenimmigration courts and all immigration appeals.   The Alien Border Control Committee on which Milhollan servedsought to ``expeditiously remove terrorist aliens found within theUnited States'' and deport ``alien activists who are not inconformity with their immigration status,'' according to thedocuments, obtained under the Freedom of Information act.   Also on the panel were the director of the Justice Department'sOffice of Immigration Litigation, which is prosecuting Van DerHorn's clients, and representatives of the FBI, the CIA and theState Department.   ``It's outrageous that a government official, supposed to besitting in a judicial capacity, would be meeting with theprosecutorial arm of the agency whose cases he's reviewing,'' VanDer Hout said.   ``It's like a federal judge meeting with prosecutors in advanceof trying a case,'' he said.   Van Der Hout and other lawyers for the immigrants have petitionedU.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson to summon Milhollan to testifyabout his role.   The eight immigrants were arrested in January 1987 and jailed foralmost two weeks on charges that they belonged to a Palestiniangroup with a history of terrorism, the Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine.   In December, Wilson overturned several key provisions of theMcCarran-Walter Act, which authorized the deportation of aliens whoadvocate communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the unlawfuldestruction of property.   The government has appealed that decision.</TEXT></DOC>
