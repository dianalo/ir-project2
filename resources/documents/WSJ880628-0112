A Yamaichi director, who asked not to be named, said that Japan's insider-information problem &quot;is very big&quot; and that all major securities firms must take countermeasures.    Japan's two largest securities houses, Nomura Securities and Daiwa Securities, have recently announced specific changes, mostly centering on trying to halt the spread of information between various departments.    &quot;At the least, we have to divide the corporate department and the underwriting department,&quot; the Yamaichi executive said, which would be similar to the plan announced by Nomura.    Japan's so-called Big Four securities firms all have &quot;hojin,&quot; or corporate departments, responsible for relationships with major industrial companies. These officials receive information from companies in most areas, ranging from underwriting and new investment to mergers and acquisitions. Some industry observers believe certain officials take advantage of this broad range of inside information to trade. </TEXT></DOC>
