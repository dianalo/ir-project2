The assistant prosecutor and the gendarmes, who were assigned toprotect him, were taken hostage on the island of Ouvea about 110miles north of Noumea, the capital of this South Pacific Frenchterritory.   On Ouvea Friday, separatists killed four police officers andtook 27 others hostage.

In Paris, the French government was considering a ban on themain separatist group, the Kanak Socialist National LiberationFront, the newspaper France-Soir reported. It was quoting France'sminister for overseas territories, Bernard Pons.   ``Until now, there has been no reason for taking such a step,''Pons said. ``The (separatist group) could be considered a componentof the political life of the territory, but current events lead meto re-examine the question.''   Scattered violence was reported elsewhere on the archipelagotoday.   Officials said police arrested 11 people in the village of St.Louis, about 13 miles from Noumea, after an exchange of gunfire.
