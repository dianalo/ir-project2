WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The resignation of Italy's top investigator of theMafia has shaken public confidence in the government's battle withthe mob and prompted fears about a new wave of corruption in Sicily.   Giovanni Falcone and eight other investigating magistrates, whoplayed a prominent role in Italy's largest Mafia trial, resignedSaturday. The so-called maxi-trial ended in December withconvictions of 338 Mafiosi, including 19 reputed members of theCosa Nostra's leadership commission.   The nine magistrates of the ``anti-Mafia pool'' in Sicilysubmitted their resignations to the Superior Council ofMagistrates, which oversees Italian judges, and asked to betransferred to other posts.   Falcone gave several reasons for the action, including what hecalled obstruction of Mafia investigations on the island of Sicily.   In a letter to the council, Falcone cited ``ommissions andinertia'' in the fight against organized crime. ``That which Ifeared could happen unfortunately happened. The investigations intothe Mafia have been obstructed and (the anti-Mafia pool) ... is nowstalled.''   Falcone also said in the letter that he wanted to leave his jobso he could testify freely before a Rome inquiry into Mafiainvestigations.   The Council of Magistrates has been holding an inquiry intostatements by the prosecutor of the Sicilian city of Marsala, PaoloBorsellino, that state and local officials curbed the power of theanti-Mafia group.   Palermo's mayor said Falcone's resignation could mark a returnto the days when Sicilian authorities and politicians conspiredwith the mob.   ``We have weeded out corrupt politicians, or those who were insome way accomplices of the Mafia,'' the mayor, Leoluca Orlando,said in an interview with the state-run RAI television Saturdaynight.   ``Today,'' he said, ``we are worried that there can be a returnto the past, a return to the years in which magistrates, policemenand politicians were in collusion with the Mafia. I wouldn't wantto return to the past.''   Ten days ago, Borsellino caused a national uproar when hecharged that authorities had gone soft on the Mafia since the``maxi-trial'' and that state and local officials had curbed thepower of the magistrates.   The charges prompted President Francesco Cossiga to dispatchnational police officials to Palermo to examine the situation. Healso ordered the inquiry by the national judges' council in Rome.   In his letter to the council, Falcone also said his methods``differ radically'' with those of his new superior, Antonino Meli.   Meli was appointed overseeing magistrate in February despiteobjections by Falcone that he had no experience in Mafia probes.   Falcone said his resignation should be seen as ``the profoundunease of one who must perform a delicate job in unfavorableconditions and the desire to express freely my thoughts without anyconditions.''   The anti-Mafia pool was put together in 1983, after aninvestigator was killed in Palermo. The team worked under heavysecurity and devoted attention to fighting the Mafia.   The magistrates were the first to take advantage of new laws toexamine bank accounts of anyone suspected of Mafia association. Theinformation was used successfully in trials of suspected Mafia drugtraffickers.   Falcone won the cooperation of Tomasso Buscetta, a Mafia leaderwho broke the mob's code of silence to describe its commandstructure in the 1987 trial.   Falcone has become a national symbol of Italy's war on organizedcrime and is considered its top investigator of the Mafia.</TEXT></DOC>
