Laurel made his remarks during a news conference in which helikened Mrs. Aquino to deposed President Ferdinand Marcos. Laurelobjected to a statement Mrs. Aquino made Sunday in which sheclaimed to have a ``contract with God'' to lead the country untilher term expires in 1992.   Mrs. Aquino, meanwhile, asked the country's provincial governorsto block any coup attempts against her when she visits Brunei nextweek for a three-day state visit.   Laurel said Mrs. Aquino's rejection of his demand to resign andcall new elections, which he issued Aug. 13, gave him no choice butto lead the opposition.   ``Therefore, as vice president, I will devote my time to voicingout the grievances of our suffering people and lead all those whobelieve that this nation is entitled to a better government,''Laurel said.   ``Mrs. Aquino has chosen to ignore and evade the issues ofincompetence, corruption and lack of leadership that havecharacterized her administration,'' he charged. ``Once again sheregaled the people with promises which for the past 30 months shehas consistently disregarded.''   Laurel called for new elections after accusing the Aquinogovernment of incompetence. He said that if she resigned, he wouldalso resign. If not, he said he would remain vice president but``dissociate'' himself from her government.   In a speech Sunday, Mrs. Aquino accused unspecified ``enemies ofthe state'' of trying to destabilize her government. She said shewas determined to remain in office and produce economic progress.   ``Nothing and no one shall deflect me from this task,'' shesaid. ``For my mandate is with this nation, not with its enemies.My covenant is with the constitution, our contract is with God.''   Marcos had made a similar statement to justify his 20-year ruleof the Philippines, Laurel said without elaborating.   Mrs. Aquino met Monday with 45 provincial governors, duringwhich she discussed efforts to curb corruption, fight poverty andcrush the 19-year communist insurgency. She also called on thegovernors to continue supporting her government during her visit toBrunei, which begins next Monday.   ``I know that while I am away, you will take care of things, sothat my enemies will not try to pull something again,'' she said.Mrs. Aquino's government has survived at least five coup attemptsin the last two years.   Executive Secretary Catalino Macaraig said Monday the governmentwas stable enough to allow Marcos to return but would rather hestay away if it had its way. He said the government was leaving thequestion of Marcos' return to the courts.   ``I think the president is confident that the government cancope with whatever events might be triggered by the return ofPresident Marcos,'' Macaraig said.   But he warned that opponents of Marcos might try to kill him ifhe returns.   ``The military will have to give him protection,'' he said.``There is really a problem because there are those who might tryto do him harm and put the blame on the president.''   The possibility of a Marcos return from his Hawaiian exilesurfaced last week when the anti-graft court ruled the oustedpresident had the right to be present during the court depositionof a former Cabinet minister set for November.   Philippines officials accuse Marcos of stealing billions ofdollars from the treasury during his presidency.</TEXT></DOC>
