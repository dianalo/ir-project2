To further this objective, EPA entered into a cooperative agreementwith the National Governor's Association (NGA) to develop a forum to discusscapacity related issues and make recommendations to EPA on the nature ofcapacity assurance guidance. NGA was to examine alternatives in four broadareas: (1) Data and projections; (2) the role of waste minimization; (3)interstate agreements; and (4) plans for developing new capacity. In lightof the substantial interest and debate which occurred on the interstatissues, (e.g., interstate agreements and resolution of differences amongStates) it was determined that alternative approaches to these issues shouldbe examined. The documents published today for public comment are the resultof work products received under the NGA Cooperative Agreement and the alternativediscussed above (See Chapters 1 and 2 and note the deletion of AppendixA).<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Capacity Assurance Plan Contents</ITAG>The following is a summary of the key elements identified as critical inthe development of capacity assurance plans (CAPs):Data and ProjectionsEstabishes procedures for States to use to determine the amount of hazardouswaste generated within their borders, the amount of treatment and disposalcapacity available within their state; the amount of waste imported andexported from and to other States; and the amount of generation and capacityprojected to be available over a twenty year period. Extensive use is madeof EPA's biennial report data, TSDRF survey data, and technical supportprepared by EPA's Office of Solid Waste.Uses of Waste MinimizationExplains how States may use waste minimization as part of their strategyfor making capacity assurances, and establishes procedures for reportingto EPA on elements of waste minimization programs, estimating the effectsof such programs on long-term capacity needs, communicating with industry,and measuring the effects of waste minimization programs.Plans for Developing New CapacityExplains how States whose data and projections indicate the need for additionalin-state capacity can demonstrate to EPA that they have an adequate planfor developing new capacity; also establishes reporting procedures forState facility siting programs and milestones for capacity development.Interstate AgreementsExplains how States which must rely on the availability of treatment anddisposal capacity in another State can make a CERCLA section 104(c)(9)capacity assurance. In accordance with the Statute, a valid interstateagreement is necessary for an exporter State to assure availability ofout-of-State capacity.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Interstate Alternative Approaches</ITAG>The following summary identifies key differences in the interstate alternativesarticulated in the documents that follow:Nature of the Interstate Agreement<ITAG tagnum="81">NGA Recommendation</ITAG>All States should be required to provide a generic interstate agreement(1) recognizing current levels of imports/exports; (2) agreeing to participatein the planning and resolution procedure outlined in the guidance; and(3) agreeing to carry out the siting activities contained in their capacityassurance plan.<ITAG tagnum="81">Alternative</ITAG>All exporting and importing States should provide generic interstate agreements.This agreement acknowledges the waste management practices contained intheir capacity assurance documentation including all import and exportwaste flows. In the event that some importing States cannot sign the genericagreement, affected exporting States should seek separate bilateral agreementswith another State with excess treatment and/or disposal capacity.Who Shall Sign an Interstate Agreement?<ITAG tagnum="81">NGA Recommendation</ITAG>EPA should require each State to sign a generic interstate agreement asa necessary condition for obtaining EPA's approval of its CAP. States failingto provide the generic interstate agreement should be subject to CERCLA104(c)(9) sanctions. Failure of an importing State to provide a genericagreement would not necessarily impose a obligation on exporting Statesto secure a specific interstate agreement.<ITAG tagnum="81">Alternative</ITAG>Exporting States must have an interstate agreement from the importing Statethat acknowledges available treatment and/or disposal capacity in thatState. Failure of an exporting State to obtain such an interstate agreementwould make its CERCLA 104(c)(9) assurance statutorily insufficient. ExportingStates could obtain an interstate agreement with any other importing Statethat demonstrates it has surplus capacity.Nature of Conflict Resolution Procedures<ITAG tagnum="81">NGA Recommendation</ITAG>EPA should develop a formal process to deal with interstate disputes overa period of four years beginning with the submittal of the CAPs. Stepsin the process should include:(1) National analysis and publication of data on interstate waste flows;(2) Convening of a forum to raise and discuss interstate issues which maylead to regional or multi-state planning efforts; (3) Refinement of ``reasonableness'' criteria for export practices;(4) Resolution of interstate conflicts;(5) Application of CERCLA 104(c)(9) sanctions against States not meeting``reasonableness'' criteria;(6) EPA's concurrence under RCRA consistency for importing States to restrictquantity of waste transported from an exporting State found to be unreasonable.<ITAG tagnum="81">Alternative</ITAG>This version of the guidance acknowledges EPAs responsibility only to ensurethat States provide adequate assurances of capacity. All conflicts shouldbe negotiated and resolved at the State level prior to submittal of theCAPs. EPA will not undertake to determine the reasonableness of levelsof interstate waste flows.Final Authority to Determine Unreasonable Exports<ITAG tagnum="81">NGA Recommendations</ITAG>If interstate issues cannot be resolved informally or through regionalor multi-state planning efforts, importing States would have the abilityto petition EPA for a formal hearing on whether or not a particular exportingState violates ``reasonableness'' criteria. EPA is expected to define objectivecriteria for application to individual State conflicts. EPA would developa formal record and issue a determination supporting or denying the aggrievedState's petition. The EPA finding would be the basis for applying CERCLA104(c)(9) sanctions.<ITAG tagnum="81">Alternative</ITAG>The final authority for determining unreasonable export practices shouldrest with importing States. Importing States may exercise this simply bywithholding, or revoking, their interstate agreement with an exportingState. Exporting States not able to execute an agreement for availabletreatment and/or disposal capacity in another importing State would thenbe subject to CERCLA 104(c)(9) sanctions.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: August 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J. Winston Porter,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Administrator, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">NGA Recommendations on Draft State Hazardous Waste Capacity AssuranceGuidance</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Chapter I_Introduction and Overview of the Capacity Assurance Process</ITAG>This document provides guidance to state officials on how to prepare astate Capacity Assurance Plan (CAP). Each state must complete a CAP byOctober 17, 1989 to comply with the requirements of section 104(c)(9) ofthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act(CERCLA), as amended. This section requires each state to assure the Administratorthat adequate capacity will exist to manage the hazardous waste createdin the state over the next twenty years (see below). A state's failureto submit an approved CAP by the October 1989 deadline will prohibit thestate from receiving Superfund money for remedial actions until such timeas assurance is approved by EPA. The availability of funds for emergencyremoval action is not affected by this requirement.``<T3>SITING.</T3>_Effective 3 years after enactment of the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986, the President shall not provide any remedialactions pursuant to this section unless the State in which the releaseoccurs first enters into a contract or cooperative agreement with the Presidentproviding assurances deemed adequate by the President that the State willassure the availability of hazardous waste treatment or disposal facilitieswhich_(A) Have adequate capacity for the destruction, treatment, or secure dispositionof all hazardous wastes that are reasonably expected to be generated withinthe State during the 20-year period following the date of such contractor cooperative agreement and to be disposed of, treated, or destroyed,(B) Are within the State or outside the State in accordance with an interstateagreement or regional agreement or authority,(C) Are acceptable to the President, and (D) Are in compliance with the requirements of Subtitle C of the SolidWaste Disposal Act.''_<T3>Section 104(k) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Actof 1986 amending section 104(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as the ``Superfund'').</T3>Legislative Background on SARA Section 104(k)The Congress added these requirements to CERCLA through the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). The purpose of this provision wasstraightforward: Superfund money should not be spent in states that aretaking insufficient steps to avoid the creation of future Superfund sites.The Congress recognized that a safe and rational hazardous waste managementprogram for the nation depended in part on the creation of new facilitiesemploying the most advanced technologies. While many states enacted orplanned to enact siting legislation, Congress concluded that few, if any,were developing policies and siting programs that would assure continuedfacility capacity in the long term.Congress stressed that a successful state siting program should recognizethree key principles. First, the program should require a complete technicalanalysis of all proposed sites prior to their selection. Second, site selectionmust be accompanied by full public participation. Third, the process ofsite selection should find a way to transcend blanket local vetoes. TheCongress further stressed, however, that merely having such programs inplace would not satisfy the requirements of this section. Each state mustprovide assurances that their legislative program can work and will beused. The siting process may differ between states, but each program shouldmake the best of existing facilities in the short term and assure continuedfacility capacity in the long term.Finally, Congress did not envision that every state would need to developredundant or unneeded capacity. A site in every state is not required.In some cases, multi-state efforts may be appropriate, requiring some assurancethat access exists to out-of-state facilities. Such access is to be assuredthrough ``an interstate agreement or regional agreement or authority.''In passing this statute, Congress did not explicitly address what shouldconstitute a state assurance to EPA. Much was left to interpretation. Moreover,the nature of the data available, the interstate market, and methods topredict future waste generation demand a flexible approach in interpretingand implementing this requirement.In EPA's view, the CAP should serve a threefold purpose. First, it shouldeffectively demonstrate to the Agency that each state is taking measuresto ensure that the hazardous waste created within its borders are and willbe effectively managed. Second, it should establish a process under whichinterstate issues related to hazardous waste management are properly resolvedand multi-state planning efforts are encouraged. Third, the CAP shouldserve as a document to educate and inform the public on the state's strategyfor managing the hazardous waste generated by its industry and other sources.EPA's Responsibility To Implement the SARA Section 104(k) RequirementsThe Agency is responsible for developing a procedure for implementing therequirements of CERCLA Section 104(c)(9). The Administrator plans to carryout this process through three major efforts: (1) Publish guidance explaininghow to prepare a state Waste Capacity Assurance Plan (CAP) for submissionto EPA; (2) provide technical assistance and limited financial resourcesto the states; and (3) review and approve the state submissions.Because of the many complex issues involved, EPA sought the advice of stateofficials, industry, private citizens, and public interest groups as partof developing this guidance package. The recommendations contained in thisdocument reflect the views of these affected parties and specifically addressthe following problem areas:andbullet; Data used throughout the states varies in uniformity. To helpstates convert their data to a uniform and consistent format for reportingpurposes, EPA will provide technical assistance for states that use theNew Biennial Report System, the Old Biennial Report System, or equivalentdata from state reports or manifest data.andbullet; Waste projections techniques are uncertain and under development.To accommodate the different approaches available to project waste generation,the guidance permits states to develop their own procedures as long asthey meet general criteria.andbullet; Waste minimization is a valuable waste management tool but itsresults are difficult to predict. To encourage states to develop wasteminimization programs, the assurance process grants maximum flexibilityto states in calculating the effects of such programs on the demand forfuture management capacity.andbullet; The current waste management market is multi-state, and privately-runfor the most part. To allow states to effectively assure the availabilityof capacity in other states without executing complicated interstate agreementsthe guidance requires states to enter into a process to resolve interstatewaste management issues and assure the availability of management capacityover the long term.The Role of the States in Implementing the Capacity Assurance RequirementsApproximately 90 percent of the hazardous waste generated by industry todayis handled in facilities owned by the generator and dedicated to that firm'swaste; the remainder of the waste is handled in commercial facilities locatedthroughout the U.S. The EPA recognizes that while states regulate, theydo not control the development or operation of hazardous waste managementfacilities both privately and commercially operated. The requirement thatstates ``assure'' the availability of management capacity to future hazardouswaste generators ostensibly requires states to control what is beyond theircurrent purview. The Agency believes the intent of the law was far more pragmatic. In apractical sense, states may not control the current hazardous waste marketsystem, but state policies can influence it. To fulfill the intent of thelaw, a state must use the CAP as an opportunity to review its policiesregarding the development and maintenance of sound hazardous waste managementfacilities. A state must look to the needs of its industry and determinewhether current state policies allow or facilitate the development of environmentallysafe treatment and disposal options for that industry. It must determinewhether a lack of adequate capacity in the state is a result of restrictivepolicies that encourage industry to send their waste elsewhere. Finally,if substantial capacity shortfalls are projected in the CAP, the statemust employ one or more of the options outlined in this guidance: createnew capacity in the state through changes in state policy, institute programsto reduce the amount of waste generated in the state, or enter into multi-stateplanning efforts to site management capacity. Evaluation Criteria to be Used by EPA To comply with section 104(c)(9), each state must complete the reportingrequirements outlined in this guidance document. The CAP submitted by thestate will not be approved unless it meets the following criteria: 1. The state must submit complete and accurate information showing currentgeneration, waste management capacity, imports, and exports. 2. The state must show that its projection of waste generation and demandcapacity meet the following guidelines: (a) The underlying economic assumptions used in the projections shouldreflect existing or official projections of state economic activity unlessotherwise justified by the state; (b) The projections must account for major waste producing industries andthe range of possible changes in the economic behavior of these industries;(c) The projections must account for one-time only wastes (e.g., CERCLAor RCRA remedial corrective actions); (d) The projections must correctly incorporate effects of waste minimizationas outlined in the state's plan; and (e) The projections must document assumptions regarding waste imports andexports. 3. For states that rely on waste minimization to reduce the demand forcapacity, the state must demonstrate that: (a) The estimated reductions in wastes are based on a sound technical evaluationof the potential effects of waste minimization in the state. (Availableinformation, such as existing surveys of specific industries and engineeringanalysis of potential reductions, may be used in this evaluation); (b) The resources committed to implementing the waste minimization strategyare consistent with the plan set forth by the state; and, (c) The milestones for projected accomplishments in waste minimizationare reasonable and there is a plan to implement these activities. 4. States must execute the agreement set forth in Chapter II and describedin Appendix A if they plan to use management capacity in other states atany time over the 20-year ``assurance'' timeframe. 5. For states showing capacity shortfalls in its projections, the statemust meet the following requirements: (a) It must document the type and quantity of capacity needed and the stateprocedures that would result in the development of such capacity, includingparticipation in interstate or regional planning efforts; (b) If additional capacity is to be created inside the state, the CAP mustshow that state and local laws, regulations, practices, and policies willnot hinder the development of additional capacity, when needed, and areconsistent with the proposed plan submitted in the CAP. Laws, regulations,policies, and practices that may be found to hinder development of additionalcapacity include, but are not limited to the following: (i) Local preemption powers not based on environment, health, or safetyconcerns with no ability for the state to appeal or rectify local decisions;(ii) Absence of a siting procedure with clearly defined steps, includingopportunity for public review and comment, and clear time periods betweenpermit review, comment, and approval/denial; (iii) The enactment of rules that may be viewed as discriminatory, suchas limits on facility size, types of waste allowed based on origin of waste,and prohibition of waste facilities not based on environmental, health,or safety considerations; and (iv) A demonstrated history of failed efforts to create additional capacityin the presence of sufficient demand for that capacity. (c) For states that plan to rely upon capacity outside the state to addressthe projected shortfall, the CAP must show that such reliance does notconflict with the ``reasonableness'' criteria set forth in Appendix A.EPA expects the states to prepare and submit an assurance to the Administratorno later than October 17, 1989. EPA also plans to request revised assuranceson a periodic basis, most likely in concert with the biennial report fromTSD facilities. At this time, EPA plans to request the first revision byOctober 1991. Each time a state enters into a cooperative agreement withEPA to obligate Superfund monies, the state must certify that their currentassurance represents current policy to the best of their understanding.EPA will establish a standard certification paragraph on compliance withSARA section 104(k), which will appear on all SARA cooperative agreementsfor remedial action funding. <ITAG tagnum="52">Chapter II_Basic Instructions For Completing The State Capacity AssurancePlan </ITAG>This chapter provides states with the basic instructions needed to completetheir Capacity Assurance Plan (CAP) in accordance with this guidance document.Each chapter in the guidance provides specific instructions for reportinginformation to EPA. This chapter outlines the format of the CAP, the technicalassistance provided by EPA to complete portions of the CAP, and instructionsfor transmitting the state's final CAP to EPA. Capacity Assurance Plan Format The state should submit its CAP to EPA as a single document consistingof five Parts, based on the information required in the guidance document:andbullet; Part 1 should contain the results of Chapter III of the GuidanceDocument, which requests information on current generation, managementcapacity, imports and exports. This chapter asks each state to demonstratean understanding of its current hazardous waste generation, treatment,and disposal system, and provides a format for all states to manipulatetheir data internally and report key information to EPA. andbullet; Part 2 should incorporate the results of Chapter IV of the GuidanceDocument concerning state waste minimization plans. This Part will provideinformation on each state's use of waste minimization in the capacity assuranceprocess. States that plan to use waste minimization to help them assurethe availability of adequate management capacity must supply more detaileddocumentation on their ongoing and planned efforts. andbullet; Part 3 should incorporate the results of Chapter V of the GuidanceDocument, which requires states to project hazardous waste generation andthe demand for management capacity. This chapter also requires states toestimate the amount of capacity needed in the state over the next 20 years.andbullet; Part 4 should incorporate the results of Chapter VI of the GuidanceDocument, which covers state laws and procedures for creating managementcapacity within the state. All states showing a shortfall in managementcapacity in Part 3 must describe their plans for addressing this shortfallin this Part. Technical Assistance Available From EPA EPA recognizes an adequate CAP includes a thorough understanding of currentgeneration, management capacity, waste imports, and waste exports. Thisis the critical information required in Chapter III (Part 1 of the CAP)and used in all subsequent calculations concerning future waste managementpractices. EPA realizes that developing this information may be difficultfor some states because of differences in data collection and managementsystems. To help states complete Chapter III of the Guidance Document,and to ensure that all states assemble data into the same format for theCAP, EPA has provided three forms of technical assistance. This assistanceis located in a <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3>, which will be issued by EPA in October,1988. The <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> will cover the following major topics:1. Optional conversion methodologies will be detailed to allow the 700RCRA waste codes to be aggregated into 17 common reporting categories usedin the CAP. These conversion methodologies will allow states using thenew Biennial Report, the Old Biennial Report (including comparable dataobtained from state reports and manifests), and the California UCD codesto convert their waste data into 17 common categories. 2. An optional default methodology will be described to allow states toassign the 17 waste categories to the 15 waste management categories usedin the CAP. This default methodology will be based on current waste managementpractices; states will be free to choose different alternatives and mustadjust the default methodology for when used to project future practices.3. A procedure will be described for converting EPA-supplied data on wastemanagement capacity in your state (by facility ID number) to the 15 wastemanagement categories of the CAP. The facility-by-facility informationwill be supplied under separate cover and will include information on facilitystatus (on-site, commercial, or captive) and capacity (currently used,currently available, and future plans). States will be required to review,correct, and assemble this information for reporting their capacity needs.Finally, EPA will be developing computer-based programs to facilitate thecalculations described in the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3>. The programs will be designed to utilizea common software system and will be made available in the fall of 1988.Additional technical assistance can be obtained by using the EPA Hotline,which is available during the hours of XX and XX Eastern Standard Time,Monday through Friday. In addition, the EPA Regional Office serving yourstate has assigned several individuals to answer questions. Please consultthe <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> for more details, including a listof individuals and phone numbers. Executing The Interstate Agreement Those states that will use out-of-state capacity to meet their waste managementneeds at any time over the 20-year assurance timeframe must execute theInterstate Agreement attached to this chapter. The background, intent,and terms of the agreement are explained in Appendix A. Failure to executethis agreement (as appropriate) will result in disapproval of the CAP.Transmitting The CAP To EPA A state's capacity assurance plan should be transmitted to EPA on or beforeOctober 17, 1989. Please send XX copies of the CAP to the following address:United States Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington,DC 20460, Attn: XXXXXXX. <ITAG tagnum="81">INTERSTATE AGREEMENT</ITAG>Pursuant to the requirements of Section 104(k)(9) of the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986, and the Waste Capacity Assurance Guidelinesissued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto; andIn recognition of the fact that this state is both an importer and exporterof hazardous waste; andIn accordance with similar agreements on behalf of other state governmentsrespecting interstate transport and disposal of hazardous waste:The state of _____ hereby agrees to the following:1. The government of this state is aware of the status quo of interstatewaste shipments;2. In accordance with other state agreements, the government of this stateagrees to participate in the planning, analysis, and resolution processto address interstate transport and disposal of hazardous waste as outlinedin Appendix A of the Waste Capacity Assurance Guidelines issued by theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and3. The government of this state intends to carry out the activities describedin the state's Capacity Assurance Plan, which will include programs and/ormilestones relevant to waste minimization and the management of hazardouswaste.Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to affect the existing obligationsof the states in a manner that would subject this Agreement to the purviewof Clause 3, Section 10, Article I of the United States Constitution.<ITAG tagnum="6">________</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Governor or Designee</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Chapter III_Reporting the Current Status of Generation, ManagementCapacity, Imports, and Exports</ITAG>PurposeThis chapter asks each state to demonstrate an understanding of its currenthazardous waste generation, treatment, and disposal system. It requiresa strong technical knowledge of your state's hazardous waste managementand tracking information systems, including data needed to meet federalreporting requirements. The key items to be reported are as follows:andbullet; The type and quantity of federally regulated (under RCRA) hazardouswaste generated within the state from both continuous industrial processesas well as one-time events, such as ``batch'' cleanups and RCRA and CERCLAcorrective actions.andbullet; The type and quantity of federally regulated hazardous waste shippedout-of-state.andbullet; The type and quantity of federally regulated hazardous waste receivedfrom other states.andbullet; The type and quantity of in-state capacity to manage RCRA-regulatedhazardous waste and other waste not regulated by the EPA that consumesthe state's hazardous waste management capacity, including state-regulatedwaste and non-hazardous waste.Much of the information developed in this chapter will serve as a baselinefor projecting future waste generation and disposal patterns. For example,information developed on the unused capacity available at instate facilitieswill be useful when assessing future capacity needs. Similarly, currentpatterns of waste imports and exports can be used to project future behavior.General InstructionsThis chapter provides guidance to states on their responsibilities forreporting information on current waste generation, handling, and disposition.Personnel completing this chapter should consult the separate<T3> Technical Reference Manual</T3> for more detailed instructions onsources of data, data manipulation, and translation of raw data into thereporting formats provided in this chapter.The following worksheets must be completed to fulfill the minimum requirementsof Part I of the CAP:andbullet; Worksheet III-1 summarizing in-state generation of 17 types ofRCRA-hazardous waste.andbullet; Worksheet III-2 summarizing in-state waste management capacity.andbullet; Worksheets III-3, III-4, III-5, and III-6 reporting the demandsimposed by each of the 17 types of hazardous waste on each of the 15 wastemanagement categories (as applicable) in total and for on-site, off-sitecaptive, and commercial facilities.andbullet; Worksheet III-7 providing detail on waste exports.andbullet; Worksheet III-8 providing detail on waste imports.States may develop their own report forms (computer-driven reports aresatisfactory) but they must follow the general formats of the worksheetslisted above. Other worksheets and interim results may be included in theCAP at the discretion of the state unless otherwise noted.Only RCRA-regulated wastes are to be reported in the Worksheets. If a statecompiles figures for state-regulated waste, they should not be reportedin the Worksheets submitted as part of the state CAP. Similarly, althougha state may wish to track such quantities separately, the waste generatedby small quantity generators (less than 1000 kilograms of waste per month)should not be entered into the Worksheets to be submitted in a state'sCAP.The individual or individuals responsible for completing this chapter shouldbe thoroughly familiar with both state and federal hazardous waste reportingsystems. In almost all states, these individuals will be part of the state'sRCRA program office. However, staff from the state's Superfund office orthe equivalent EPA regional Superfund Office must be consulted to obtaininformation concerning site cleanups.Technical assistance is available from EPA in several forms. A hotlineat the Agency is available during the hours of XX and XX Eastern StandardTime, Monday through Friday. In addition, the EPA regional office servingyour state has assigned several individuals to answer questions; namesand addresses are provided in the<T3> Technical Reference Manual.</T3> EPA has provided direct technicalassistance through regional efforts to coordinate compliance with SARAsection 104(k). If states are unaware of these on-going initiatives, theyshould contact the RCRA coordinators in their regional offices for additionalinformation.Technical Reference ManualThe<T3> Technical Reference Manual</T3> that accompanies this guidance isdesigned to help extract and manipulate raw data from Biennial Reportsand similar state sources and produce reports for inclusion in a state'sCAP. It provides four sets of instructions, one of which will be applicableto your state, based on whether your state computerizes the Biennial Reportor the equivalent data and whether your state uses the old or new Biennialreport forms (or equivalent data).Evaluation CriteriaThe Agency plans to judge this document primarily on the accuracy of thedata and supporting material used to complete the worksheets. In most cases_unlessotherwise noted by the state_EPA expects the waste generation data containedin the worksheets to correspond with information obtained by EPA throughits major reporting system, the Biennial Report. The Agency recognizesthat differences will exist, however, between the state and federal reportingsystems. States showing wide disparity between the amount of waste reportedfor the CAP and that reported to meet other federal requirements may beasked for more details.EPA plans to provide individualized state reports with detail on hazardouswaste management capacity in that state as reported in the agency's recent<T3> Treatment, Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Survey</T3> (TSDR). Thiswill allow states to report consistent and relatively accurate baselineinformation on waste management capacity. Recognizing that some informationfrom the TSDR survey may be up to three years obsolete at the time of thefirst CAP, states are encouraged to check these data and augment or correctthem before presenting them in the CAP. Any corrections should be documentedwith a simple narrative discussion of changes.Reporting Waste GenerationMost states now report the generation of hazardous waste by EPA waste code.More than 700 waste streams comprise EPA's list of regulated industrialresiduals. Two states_California and Washington_report waste flows usinga more aggregated set of waste codes developed at the University of California,Davis (these comprise the so-called UCD codes). For purposes of capacityassurance, all waste streams are to be grouped into 17 SARA waste types,which provide sufficient information for assignment to management methods.Tables XX, XX, and XX of the<T3> Technical Reference Manual</T3> provide conversion factors to aggregatethe EPA and UCD waste codes into this new waste type system. These tablesmatch waste streams in either the EPA or UCD categories to the capacityassurance waste streams on the basis of waste phase (liquid, sludge, orsolid) and major constituent (organic components, metals, halogenated compounds).Several miscellaneous categories convert directly.States using the new 1987 Biennial Report forms should use appropriatetables and procedures described in the<T3> Technical Reference Manual</T3> to transfer EPA waste codes into their17-waste type equivalent. This method uses the data on waste stream characteristicsin conjunction with the designated EPA waste code to create a relativelyprecise mapping procedure.States using the old Biennial Report forms should use a different set oftables and procedures presented in the<T3> Technical Reference Manual</T3> to convert EPA waste codes into the17 SARA waste types. These conversions are generally considered less precisebecause less is known about waste stream characteristics. Where necessary,the procedures use a national profile of waste characteristics to facilitatethe conversion.Table XX of the<T3> Technical Reference Manual</T3> maps UCD waste codes into the capacityassurance waste streams based on waste phase and major constituent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Waste Streams To Be Reported</ITAG>States should report only RCRA-regulated waste in the worksheets that presentwaste generation. States need not report the following when describingwaste generation: waste volumes that are regulated only by state law; wastesgenerated and handled through exempt onsite NPDES processes; exempt onsitein-process recycling (closed loop); exempt onsite treatment and dischargeto municipal treatment works; direct discharge to publicly owned treatmentworks without treatment; and exempt onsite recycling through stills. Forplanning purposes, states may wish to account for these or other typesof regulated waste, but they should include such wastes in separate formsfrom those used to report RCRA-only regulated waste.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sources of Data To Report Waste Generation</ITAG>For purposes of the 1989 assurance, all states should use the 1987 BiennialReport or the equivalent data elements collected in state reports to estimate1987 calendar year generation of these 17 waste types. While availabilitywill vary from state-to-state, equivalent sources of data include statesurveys of generators, waste management facility inventories, state-modifiedbiennial report forms, or waste manifest reports.<ITAG tagnum="84">Establishing A Base Year</ITAG>The EPA requests that states use 1987 as the base year to report wastegeneration. However, if a state has more accurate data for 1985 or 1986and feels that these data more precisely represent waste generation intheir state (because, for example, the state spent considerable resourcesto collect and analyze that data), they should present these figures andidentify the alternate base year. States that choose an alternate baseyear need not estimate waste generation in 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">Units To Report Waste Generation</ITAG>All waste quantities should be reported in tons per year. Waste expressedin volumetric terms, such as gallons, should be multiplied by the densityof the waste in question (tons per gallon, for example) to yield the mostaccurate conversion into tons. Those states using the new Biennial Reportforms will find density information for each waste stream in form GM ofPackage B, Section III, Question D. In the absence of exact density characteristics,states may use the information presented in the<T3> Technical Reference Manual</T3> (Table XX, based on the density ofwater) to convert from volume into tons. Table XX also provides severalcommon mass-to-mass conversion factors.Instructions For All WorksheetsA prototype state hazardous waste generation and handling system is depictedin Figure III-1. States should quantify the waste flows, for each of the17 capacity assurance waste types, for each of the boxes presented in FigureIII-1. Waste quantities should be reported in the worksheets noted belowthe boxes on the figure. On-site handling, for example, should be reportedin Worksheet III-4; all exports should be summarized in Worksheet III-7.Each worksheet is introduced in a general sense in this chapter. The<T3> Technical Reference Manual</T3> describes procedures to complete eachworksheet from raw data.The<T3> Technical Reference Manual</T3> is divided into four sections, basedon whether a state computerizes Biennial Report data or not and whethera state is using the old or new Biennial Report forms for the 1987 reportingcycle. States with computerized processing of new Biennial Report datashould consult Chapter 1 of the<T3> Technical Reference Manual.</T3> These states will be directed toensure that their Biennial Report data are arranged in a standard format,consistent with the specifications of the Biennial Report Data System.Once so arranged, these states can access EPA-provided software that automaticallygenerates all of the required worksheets in their proper formats. Becauseof the richness of the data collected under the new reporting system, EPA'scapacity assurance software will enable states to complete many optionalanalyses (consult the<T3> Technical Reference Manual</T3> for details).States with computerized old Biennial Report data should consult Chapter2 of the <T3>Technical Reference Manual. </T3>They will be directed to follow asimilar computer-driven procedure to complete the Worksheets III-1 throughIII-8. Because the data are generally more limited in the old BiennialReporting system, fewer optional analyses will be available. States with manual processing of new Biennial Report data should consultChapter 3 of the <T3>Technical Reference Manual. </T3>Simplifed procedures will be presentedto work directly from the Biennial report forms themselves. These statesface perhaps the most time consuming task in completing the current generationand handling worksheets. States that process old Biennial Report data manually should consult Chapter4 of the <T3>Technical Reference Manual. </T3>A similar set of simplified procedureswill help states make the linkage between raw data and the completed worksheets.States for which Biennial Report data collection and processing is handledby the appropriate EPA regional office should contact the regional EPABiennial Report coordinator to determine the applicable set of instructionsto follow. For each of the four sets of the instructions, the <T3>Technical Reference Manual </T3>describes methods to ensure that allstates (except as noted below) are able to complete the following typesof data manipulations: andbullet; Translating Biennial Report waste codes into 17 waste types; andbullet; Translating UCD waste codes into 17 waste types; andbullet; Translating TSDR Survey and Biennial Report waste management codesto 15 management categories; andbullet; Matching SARA waste types to SARA management categories basedeither on a national profile or new Biennial report data; andbullet; Separating one-time waste generation from recurrent generationbased on new Biennial Report data; andbullet; Presenting both old and new Biennial Report data in the formatsspecified in Worksheets III-1 through III-8; andbullet; Sorting of exported waste by waste type; andbullet; Sorting of exported waste by management category; andbullet; Summarizing imported waste by state of origin and management category;and andbullet; Summarizing exported waste quantities by type of waste and statereceiving waste. In addition to these manipulations, the <T3>Technical Reference Manual </T3>provides flow diagrams describing thelogic used to abstract data from both the old and new Biennial Report andreport waste quantities as (1) generated and managed onsite, (2) generatedonsite and managed offsite, or (3) imported for management in state. Instructions For Worksheet III-1 Worksheet III-1 asks states to summarize total in-state generation of RCRA-regulatedwaste. Total generation is comprised of primary generation (waste by-productsof manufacturing processes) and secondary generation (waste by-productsof waste treatment processes). While states need not draw this distinctionin the worksheet, states accessing EPA's capacity assurance software willbe able to generate a separate worksheet for each component. Worksheet III-1 also asks states to separate total generation into recurrentand one-time waste quantities. Recurrent wastes include both primary andsecondary streams attributable to on-going industrial activity. One-timewastes include those that result from isolated events such as equipmentcleaning or decommissioning, site cleanup, or off-spec product disposal.Only states using the new Biennial Report forms will be able to separaterecurrent from one-time waste generation. States using the old BiennialReport forms, which do not directly support such an analysis, should estimateone-time generation to the best of their ability, following instructionsin the <T3>Technical Reference Manual. </T3>The <T3>Technical Reference Manual </T3>presents both computerized and manualprocedures to assist in this separation. Instructions for Worksheet III-2Worksheet III-2 asks states to summarize the waste handling capacity currentlyavailable in their state. EPA will supply all the necessary figures tocomplete this worksheet for the 1989 CAP. Because the basis for EPA's data,however, are the results of the 1986 National TSDR Survey, some capacityfigures may be obsolete. It is the state's responsibility to determinewhether data supplies by EPA are appropriate for use in the CAP. Therefore,states should use their own capacity figures if they represent a more completeassessment of capacity than the EPA data. States should briefly explainin footnotes to the appropriate worksheets any differences between morerecent capacity data and those supplied by EPA. In subsequent years, states will be responsible for collecting all capacitydata is part of their normal biennial reporting requirements. Instructions For Worksheets III-3 Through III-6Together, Worksheets III-3 through III-6 constitute the core data describinga state's current hazardous waste management system. In these four worksheets,states are asked to link waste generation to demand for in-state wastemanagement capacity. Waste exports and the effect of waste imports alsomust be shown, and four types of management capacity must be examined:Total in-state; in-state, on-site, in-state, captive; and instate commercial.Completing these worksheets requires numerous data transactions; statesshould consult the <T3>Technical Reference Manual </T3>for detailed instructions on theircompletion. For convenience, Worksheet III-3 through III-6 also present a separatecapacity block to display current and planned future capacity figures.For the 1989 CAP, all capacity data will be supplied by the EPA in individualstate reports. Thereafter, states will be expected to collect these dataas part of the normal biennial reporting process. The ``exports'' column on these worksheets summarizes waste residuals generatedas a by-product of waste management processes and exported for furthermanagement at out-of-state facilities. Instructions For Worksheets III-7 and III-8 Worksheet III-7 and III-8 ask states to provide additional detail on theirwaste exports and imports, respectively. Both old and new Biennial Reportssupport the presentation of exported waste quantities by waste type andreceiving state. Similiary, both reports support the presentation of wasteimport quantities by waste type and state of origin. All states shouldconsult the <T3>Technical Reference Manual </T3>for details on procedures to completethese worksheets. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 3 601 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Worksheet III-1._Summary of In-State Generation of Waste Streams in</T4>1987<T4> (thousands of tons/year)</T4><H1>Waste types</H1><H1>One-time generation</H1><H1>Recurrent generation</H1><H1>Total generation</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1.

(For the CAP definitionof waste minimization see the Definitions Section at the end of the Chapter.)While the Agency believes a waste minimization program is a key step towardsound hazardous waste management, EPA recognizes that some states may chooseto assure adequate capacity without claiming waste reduction benefits.These states must supply only brief information on their ongoing or plannedwaste minimization efforts. Such information will be evaluated for completenessonly; EPA will not evaluate the waste minimization programs of these states.States that plan to use waste minimization to help them assure the availabilityof adequate management capacity must supply documentation on their ongoingand planned efforts. These states must describe the overall strategy oftheir programs, how they plan to account for waste minimization in theirwaste generation projections, and how these programs might affect wastegeneration for the projection years.General InstructionsTo complete the requirements of this chapter, states should respond tothe questions contained in the attached forms. States should copy and completethe appropriate forms and include them_along with additional documentation_intheir CAP. Not all forms must be completed.States not using waste minimization programs to reduce capacity demandmust complete the following form:<T3>Form I: Legislative Authority.</T3> This form requests informationon the present legislative authority for a waste minimization program,its general make up, funding, staffing, and any anticipated legislativeor programmatic changes.States that anticipate using waste minimization programs to reduce capacitydemand must complete Form I and the following forms:<T3>Form II: Waste Minimization Reduction Estimates.</T3> This form requestsdetailed information on the state's anticipated effect of state and industrialwaste minimization efforts, technical basis of these estimates, and measuresof effectiveness.<T3>Form III: Program Components Descriptions.</T3> This form requestsmore detailed information on the individual components that comprise thestate's waste minimization program.The information requested in Forms II and III will enable the EPA to assessthe reasonableness of the state's proposed goals and activities and tomonitor the progress of the state's programs.A glossary of the terms used to describe the waste minimization programcomponents is contained in the Definitions Section at the end of the chapter.In addition, technical assistance is available from EPA in several forms.A Hotline at the Agency is available during the hours of XX and XX EasternStandard Time, Monday through Friday. In addition, the EPA Regional Officeserving your state has assigned several individuals to answer questions.Please consult the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> for more details, including a listof individuals and phone numbers.Evaluation CriteriaEPA plans to evaluate each state's waste minimization plan differently.For states not choosing to incorporate any waste minimization estimatesinto projections of capacity need, the Agency will simply review the state'ssubmittal for accuracy and completeness. In these cases, the Agency willmake no judgment on the adequacy of the particular waste minimization programoperated by the state, if any such program is operating or planned.For states that rely on waste minimization to reduce the demand for wastetreatment capacity, the Agency must conduct a more detailed evaluation.For these states, the following must be demonstrated in the CAP:andbullet; The estimated reductions in waste are based on a sound technicalevaluation of the potential effects of waste minimization in your state.This does not require a technical analysis of waste minimization potentialbut an examination from available information to determine how it mightapply to your state.andbullet; The resources committed to implementing the waste minimizationstrategy are consistent with the plan set forth by the states; and,andbullet; The activities for projected accomplishments in waste minimizationare reasonable and there is a plan to implement these activities.<ITAG tagnum="71">Form I: Legislative Authority</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All states must fill out this form.

The resultis an estimate of projected capacity needs for each waste management category.The completed worksheets and narrative should represent Part 3 of the CAP.States must project waste generated within their borders in 1989, 1995,and 2009. The 1989 projection year corresponds to the next biennial reportingyear. The 1995 projection will present a near-term estimate of demandsfor waste management after most of the current hazardous waste regulations_theland disposal restrictions in particular_take effect. The law specifiedthat states assure adequate waste management capacity for 20 years, hencethe year 2009 projection. The methods contained in this chapter reflect procedures commonly usedtoday to project waste generation. The Agency recognizes the inherent uncertaintyof projections and the limitations of all procedures. For this reason,the Agency does not endorse any one system; states are free to choose theapproach that best represents their particular situation. However, allprojections must adhere to the following general guidelines: andbullet; Projections must take into account economic expansion or contractionand its effect on the quantity of waste generated by the major sourceswithin the state. andbullet; Projection must account for the effects of waste minimizationactivities on future waste generation, based on clear documentation asdescribed in Chapter IV and quantified in this chapter. andbullet; Projections must account for non-recurrent wastes (from equipmentdecommissioning or replacement, materials or product disposal, materialsor product spills, closure actions, remedial or corrective actions, orother non-routine sources) as well as waste generated from continuous industrialprocesses. andbullet; To the extent possible, the state must address the potential effectof regulatory change on future waste generation and management options.EPA will provide a list of key regulations that the states should includein their analysis. General Instructions For each of the projection years, states should summarize their projectionsof waste quantities and effects on waste management capacity using worksheetsV-1 and V-2, respectively. Worksheet V-2 is used to calculate waste managementdemand from in-state waste after subtracting waste exports. Worksheet V-3is similar to Worksheet V-2, except that it requires states to estimatemanagement capacity demand based on total instate waste generation (includingprojected exports). Final potential capacity needs are determined in WorksheetV-4, which asks states to report estimated capacity needs after incorporatingthe effect of waste imports and exports. While the combined effect of importsand exports are used to estimate capacity needs, states also must reportthe balance of total in-state generated waste (including potential exports)against total in-state available capacity (excluding potential exports).This calculation, also required in Worksheet V-4, will be used by EPA toexamine the effect of waste imports and exports on each state's capacitybalance. The following sections provide general instructions on projecting wastefrom continuous industrial processes using common economic indicators andprocedures; and projecting waste generated intermittently, such as thatresulting from RCRA and CERCLA cleanups. Much of the analysis conductedfor Chapter III will be used to complete this chapter, and similar expertisewill be needed. In addition, states should coordinate their efforts withother state offices responsible for projecting and/or tracking state industrialactivity or revenues. To the extent possible waste generation should bebased on the same economic forecast information used to project generalbusiness activity in the state or region. Technical assistance is available from EPA in several forms. A Hotlineat the Agency is available during the hours of XX and XX Eastern StandardTime, Monday through Friday. In addition, the EPA Regional Office servingyour state has assigned several individuals and phone numbers. Evaluation Criteria The Agency recognizes that no single methodology exists that is universallyacceptable for projecting hazardous waste generation. Considerable discretionis left to the states to formulate reasonable projection methods. However,the Agency plans to evaluate the waste projections portion of the state'sCAP on the following points: andbullet; The underlying economic assumptions used in the projections shouldreflect existing or official projections of state economic activity unlessotherwise justified by the state; andbullet; The projections must account for major waste producing industriesand the range of possible changes in the economic behavior of these industries;andbullet; The projections must account for non-recurrent wastes (e.g., CERCLAor RCRA remedial or corrective actions); andbullet; The projections must correctly incorporate the predicted effectsof waste minimization as outlined in Chapter IV; and andbullet; The projections must document assumptions regarding waste importsand exports as required in the CAP.Many states will have the capabilities to provide detailed estimates offuture waste generation amounts and their demand for management capacity.Others may not have these capabilities or may choose not to make detailedestimates either because they have limited industrial sources or do notforesee significant economic changes taking place. EPA will accept allprojections as long as they show that the state has considered all relevantfactors and is not in conflict with other official state policy on economicdevelopment.EPA recognizes that projections made for year 20 will be far less certainthan those made over the short term. In the absence of additional information,the EPA will accept linear extrapolation of trends developed through the1995 projection period.Projecting Recurrent Waste Generation From Industrial SourcesUsing 1987 generation as a baseline, states should first estimate expectedgeneration for projection years 1989, 1995, and 2009 solely on the basisof economic changes. States should then make adjustments to these estimatesto account for the expected effects of waste minimization as describedin Chapter IV. Finally, states should, to the best of their ability, adjusttheir projections to account for the effects of pending regulations (listedsubsequently in this chapter) on the demand for waste management capacity.<ITAG tagnum="81">Projecting Waste Generation Based on Economic Expansion or Contraction</ITAG>Economic change is a combination of two measures: changes in economic base(reflected by the basic composition of the region's industry, includingnew entrants and closures) and changes in industrial output (defined asthe total value of goods and services from current industrial production).The agency does not expect states to forecast changes in their state'seconomic base, unless such changes are likely and critical_announced plantclosures or start-ups of key industries are examples of such critical changes.However, absent such information, states should assume that the set ofindustries responsible for generating the majority of the state's hazardouswaste in the base year will exist over the projection period.The states should account for the effects of economic forces specific toeach state and, ideally, to those industries currently responsible forthe majority of waste generated. This involves two steps. First, statesshould compile a list of those industries that are responsible for generatingthe majority of waste (as defined by the 17 CAP waste categories) in theirstate. For states using EPA's new Biennial Report forms, these data areavailable in Form IC, Section IV (SIC code identification) and either GMor GS (waste quantities).Second, the waste generation characteristics of these industries shouldbe normalized to some indicator of economic output (discussed subsequently).Projections of the same economic indicator (or growth factors) then canbe used to project waste from the industrial category in question. Forstates in which most of the 17 waste categories are dominated by a singleindustry or ones having similar growth potential, these growth factorssimply may be applied to each of the 17 waste categories as appropriate.Industries of Interest. Ideally, industrial activity should be forecastfor each 4-digit SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) code industryresponsible for one percent or more of a state's total waste volume. Thereare about 450 4-digit SIC industries represented in the Office of Managementand Budget's Standard Industrial Classification system. While the mix ofmajor waste generating industries will vary from state to state, most statesshould find that less than 100 4-digit SIC industries will account for95 percent to 99 percent of total state generation. In many states, particularlythe smaller ones, the majority of hazardous waste quantities will be attributableto perhaps 20 industry groups.Even though economic projections at the 4-digit SIC code level of detailmay provide the most accurate basis for projecting future waste quantitiesattributable to economic change, states are not required to build sophisticatedprojections models to track changes at this level. States should choosethe level of detail in their economic projections best suited to theirindustrial bases, level of detail in baseline waste generation data, andtechnical support available within the state to make projections. Somestates may find, for example, that projections at the 2-digit SIC codelevel are most appropriate. Others may not have access to SIC code informationlinked to waste generation and may thus choose to project economic changeusing a statewide growth index such as total state product. All of thesemethods will be acceptable to the Agency if they are appropriately documented.Factors for Projection. Actual records of the number of product units manufactured_tonsof steel or barrels of oil, for example_are the most certain measures ofindustrial output because they capture, by definition, actual manufacturingactivity within the plant. But using these measures to project future outputin 70 to 100 industries would be unnecessarily complex. In the past fewyears, states have chosen to project economic changes using the followingindicators, specific to a target group of 4-digit SIC industries:andbullet; Total employment;andbullet; Production employment;andbullet; Value added by manufacture;andbullet; Value of shipments; andandbullet; Personal income from manufacturing (wages).States should choose the indicator that most closely approximates in-plantindustrial activity, and for which adequate data is available. None ofthe indicators above are perfect in this respect but some are better thanothers. Availability of the data may be the overriding factor influencingthe state's decision.Value of shipments, for example, is routinely reported in national aggregatestatistics and at the individual plant level. But this measure does notdistinguish between manufacturing and inventories as the source of shipments.Waste generation would be overestimated, for example, if waste was normalizedto data that represented shipments from inventories instead of production,since actual production levels (and, hence, waste) in that year would belower than shipments would indicate. In addition, the double counting associatedwith cross-shipments in value of shipments data may account for overestimatesof plant activity.Total employment also is routinely reported in national statistics andby individual plants, but changes in employment can misrepresent manufacturingactivity if management and production employment change at different rates.In addition, waste generation estimates based on employment will be significantlyoverestimated if a company headquarters, representing largely managementas opposed to production labor, constitutes a significant share of totalemployment within a given SIC code.Value added closely parallels manufacturing activity because this measureavoids the problem of inventories associated with value of shipments data.These data are more limited, however, as the national level and they arerarely reported by individual manufacturing establishments. While production employment is an input measure of manufacturing and notan output measure, it remains a good overall indicator insofar as it parallelsmanufacturing activity and is generally available at the 4-digit SIC codelevel regionally. It is important to account for changes in labor productivity,however, in projections of waste generation as a function of productionemployment. As industries automate, the ratio of waste per production employeemay change, leading to over- or underestimates of future waste productionif these adjustments are overlooked. In general, as labor productivityincreases (the output per production employee rises), more waste will becreated per employee in future years than in the baseline year. Personal income from manufacturing, or simply wages, is another good overallindicator of plant activity. Estimates of personal income from manufacturingare available in national aggregate form, by 4-digit SIC code, and by state.Sources of Data. The U.S. Department of Commerce (Bureau of the Census)and the U.S. Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics) collect andpublish historical data on value of shipments, value added, total employment,production employment and income from manufacturing at the 4-digit SICcode level, by state or by county. At a minimum, all states can use thesedata to project future trends based on trends over the past five years.Alternatively, the Bureau of Industrial Economics prepares similar projectionsfor groups of 4-digit SIC industries for the nation as a whole in its annualpublication, <T3>U.S. Industrial Outlook</T3>. States can adapt these national projectionsif they so choose or they can adjust them with state-specific data. TheBureau of the Census' publication, <T3>County Business Patterns, </T3>provides a source of historical dataon employment and sales, by industry and by county. Projections of personalincome from manufacturing by SIC code and state through the year 2000 areavailable through the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similar projectionsat the state level may be available from state agencies responsible foremployment or labor trends. Typically, a state economic development office or office of the Governorresponsible for revenue projections will prepare its own forecast of industrygrowth. These productions may be incorporated directly into capacity assuranceprojections. Reporting Projections. States should report the results of hazardous wasteprojections attributable to economic change in column A of Worksheet V-1.A separate Worksheet should be presented for each projection year. Documenting Projections. States should develop narrative support for theprojections of waste generation and demand for management types presentedin Worksheet V-1. In particular, the narrative documenting the effectsof economic change should explain how growth factors were applied to projectwaste. <ITAG tagnum="81">Incorporating the Effects of Waste Minimization </ITAG>States have the option to reduce demands for waste management capacityin 1989, 1995, and 2000 by promoting waste reduction and projecting itseffects. Plans for implementing and accounting for such activities mustbe documented in Chapter IV. In that chapter, states must identify twokey parameters of their waste reduction adjustments: (1) Target percentor tonnage reductions by waste type, and (2) a schedule over which thesereductions are expected to take place. In this chapter, states must showhow the factors developed in Chapter IV have been incorporated in theirprojections. The most straightforward approach is to adjust the expected waste quantitiesgenerated in a target year by the quantity expected to be reduced throughwaste reduction. A simple narrative explanation of how waste reductionfactors were applied should be included to support the adjustments madein column B of Worksheet V-1. <ITAG tagnum="81">Incorporating the Effects of Regulatory Changes on Waste Generation</ITAG>EPA anticipates that changes in regulations over the projection periodwill affect both waste quantities (the demand for waste management capacity)and the allowable alternatives for management. Both are expected to affecta state's ability to assure adequate capacity. This section identifiesthe extent to which states should include the effects of regulatory changeson projections of waste generation. A subsequent section addresses theeffects of regulatory changes on capacity supply and on the allowable matchingof waste types to management categories. The effects of regulatory changes on the demand side should be incorporatedin column C of Worksheet V-1. Regulatory effects on waste generation alsoshould be documented separately in a narrative statement. Because of the uncertainty in projecting these effects over a 20-year period,EPA expects the states to account for regulatory change only to the extentthat the Agency has published and can make available to the states itsRegulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for each rule, as of October 1, 1988.The RIA will describe likely quantitative effects on waste generation andconsequent demands for management technologies. The following is a listof rules that EPA expects to have an impact on capacity assurance, andfor which publication of an RIA is expected by October 1. Land Disposal Restrictions, First Third. Should affect virtually all listedand characteristic wastes and, by extension, all industries generatingthem. Expected to shift the management of certain waste streams away fromland disposal and toward incineration and other treatment options. Alsoexpected to stimulate waste reduction. Treatment standards must be promulgatedby May 8, 1990.New Listings. Should expand the number of waste streams under regulation;six new wood preserving waste streams will be proposed in September 1988,including two wastewater streams (1.1 million tons/year) and four processstreams (45,000 tons/year); two new waste streams to be added in summer1988 from methyl bromide manufacture (amounts confidential); one new wastestream from petroleum refining to be added in 1988 (200,000 tons/year).States should estimate the additions (or deletions) to regulated wastevolumes attributable to the above rules and record these results in ColumnC of Worksheet V-1. <ITAG tagnum="81">Projecting Non-Recurrent and One-Time Only Waste Generation </ITAG>Non-recurrent waste generation can result from periodic industrial operations(boiler and other process unit maintenance) and RCRA and CERCLA correctiveactions and cleanups. Waste generated from these sources_while possiblysignificant_are much more difficult to project than waste from continuousindustrial processes. In the long run, the demand for capacity imposedby one-time wastes may be less important to capacity assurance than thedemand imposed by recurrent wastes. Separating one-time from recurrentwastes, therefore, should be in the state's best interest. EPA recognizes that data for projecting the generation of one-time wasteare generally less available and less reliable than data on recurrent wastegeneration. This section describes possible methods that states may useto make such projections, given current data inadequacies. States are encouragedto develop alternative methods to project one-time waste generation andto fully document their assumptions and procedures. While data may not always be available to support realistic calculations,states_at a minimum_should attempt to estimate RCRA-hazardous waste producedfrom the following classes of activities:andbullet; Site remedial actions (from federal Superfund and state clean-ups);andbullet; RCRA corrective actions; andbullet; Underground storage tank cleanup; and andbullet; Site remediation as a result of real estate transfer statutes.The projected sum of all non-recurrent waste quantities should be reportedby waste type in column D of Worksheet V-1 (one worksheet for each projectionyear). Calculations should be documented in a separate narrative. <ITAG tagnum="81">Notice of Corrective Actions to Receiving State </ITAG>To assist states in accounting for the amounts of CERCLA corrective actionwaste imported into their state, the EPA will inform the recipient stateregarding its intention to fund remedial actions and immediate removalsthat will cause wastes to be shipped to that state. This information willinclude the source of waste, waste quantity, waste characteristics, proposedtreatment or disposal facility to receive waste, and anticipated shipmentdate. This information will be provided to the recipient state's environmentalregulatory agency at least 45 days in advance of the anticipated shipmentdate. This action will allow the recipient state an opportunity to commenton the consistency of the removal with both the exporting state's CAP andits own plan. <ITAG tagnum="81">Site Remedial Actions</ITAG>For many Superfund sites, estimates of the quantities of contaminated sitewastes (soils and groundwater) that may require off-site treatment anddisposal are available in Records of Decision (RODS). Where RODS have notyet been prepared, more limited information regarding quantities likelyto be encountered at Superfund sites may be available in Remedial Investigations,Feasibility Studies, or Hazard Ranking System listings. These documentsare available for review in EPA's 10 regional offices. The annual volumeof wastes to be removed from these sites is largely a function of the extentof contamination (and hence the decision to ship waste off-site or handleit on-site) and rate of expenditures for site cleanup activities. EPA recognizesthat these estimates will be highly uncertain, especially for those siteswithout approved RODs or for state cleanup sites without comparable documentation.Where data permit, states should prepare a list of all federal and stateSuperfund sites for which reliable estimates of the quantity to be handledis available and estimate a time interval over which actual remedial workwill be completed. Such estimates may be best made by the State Superfundoffice or the EPA regional Superfund coordinator. For each site, preparea listing of the contaminants that predominate and match them as closelyas possible to one (or more) of the 17 capacity assurance waste categories.Much of this information should be available in site investigation anddecision documents referenced above. In the absence of such information,exclude this site from further consideration.States should then estimate the quantity of Superfund waste expected tobe handled off-site at in-state facilities versus that quantity to be exported.Superfund waste shipped off-site must be manifested like any other wastestream regulated under RCRA. An analysis of current waste manifests maybe used to project future in-state handling from exported Superfund waste.Regardless of how states make this estimate, however, it should be fullydocumented with descriptions of procedures and explanations of assumptions.<ITAG tagnum="81">RCRA Corrective Action Sites</ITAG>States should assemble the following information:(1) From the regional EPA office or the state RCRA permitting office (dependingon your state's authorization), compile a list of potential RCRA sitesthat will require corrective action (be sure to include corrective actionas a condition of obtaining a Part B permit plus corrective action as acondition of closure). In most cases, states will be unable to estimatewaste quantities or waste volumes to be removed unless a Corrective MeasuresStudy (CMS) has been prepared. The Agency recognizes that as relativelyfew corrective action sites have progressed to the CMS stage (several yearsmay elapse before a potential site has been fully evaluated), states maybe limited in their ability to incorporate the effects of RCRA correctiveaction into their 1989 CAP. In the absence of these data, states may wishto assume that a proportion of RCRA facilities will require correctiveaction and document that assumption to the best of their ability.(2) Estimate the amounts and timing of expected on-site management demandsand off-site demands using methods described above for Superfund site estimates.(3) Estimate the proportion of off-site waste expected to be shipped toin-state facilities and that shipped out of state using information onwaste manifest forms. In the absence of an historical record of shipmentsfrom RCRA corrective action sites, the states should assume that all removedmaterial will be shipped to in-state facilities, if they now exist. Otherwiseassume that they will be exported.<ITAG tagnum="81">Underground Storage Tanks</ITAG>While they are regulated separately, corrective action requirements forreleases from tanks containing petroleum or hazardous substances are similarto other cleanup requirements_visibly contaminated soils must be removed.If residual contamination of groundwater or surrounding soils persists,additional cleanup is necessary. Actual levels of cleanup are determinedon the basis of site-specific environmental risks and potential exposure.States should include estimates of RCRA-hazardous waste quantities likelyto be generated as a result of underground storage tank remediation, onlyif sufficient data are available. The types of data needed include:andbullet; Inventory of tanks subject to regulationandbullet; Statistics on leakage rates, preferably by type of tankandbullet; Characterization of tank inventory by contents (gasoline, solvents,other organics, inorganics)andbullet; Field estimates of extent of contamination. If these data areavailable, states should estimate quantities and timing of demand for wastemanagement services using methods similar to those presented for estimatingSuperfund demands.<ITAG tagnum="81">Site Remediation from Real Estate Transaction Laws</ITAG>If applicable, states should include estimates of RCRA-regulated wastegenerated from site remediation pursuant to state real estate transferstatutes (i.e. New Jersey's ECRA statute) based on trends in past ratesof generation, if such data are available.<ITAG tagnum="81">Total Projected Demands</ITAG>States should record the sum of columns A through D in column E of WorksheetV-1. This quantity represents the total projected demand for waste managementcapacity without consideration for the location of handling or of the effectsof imports or exports.Matching Waste Types to Management Categories and Incorporating the Effectsof Regulatory Change on Capacity SupplyTotal demands for waste management capacity should be brought forward fromColumn E of Worksheet V-1 and distributed among the 15 waste managementcategories in Worksheet V-2 in such a way that none of the rules expectedto be in place in each projection year would be violated. Most untreatedliquid and sludges, for example, should be banned from land disposal by1995; thus, no waste of this nature should be matched with land disposalin Worksheet V-2, unless it first undergoes some treatment. States shouldbriefly describe the assumptions behind their projected matches of wastetypes to management categories.States also should estimate the demand for RCRA capacity imposed by non-regulatedwaste. EPA will provide estimates of these data as of 1986 from the TSDRSurvey. States can hold this level of demand steady over the projectionperiod or adjust it up or down, consistent with state policies on the properhandling of non RCRA-regulated waste. These entries should be documentedin a separate narrative.Projecting Efforts. States may show level, reduced, or increased exports(relative to 1987 levels) in the final column of Worksheet V-2, to theextent that they do not violate the ``reasonableness'' criteria of AppendixA. EPA will assume that the pattern of exports (the states to which differentquantities of exports are sent) in the projection years will remain thesame as the pattern of exports in 1987 as noted in Worksheet III-7. Ifa state believes that this pattern will change in any projection year,a narrative statement should accompany worksheet V-2, explaining the changes.For example, a state might enter into an agreement with another state thatchanges the pattern of export flows to that state, as reflected in bothstates' CAPs.Worksheet V-3 is similar to V-2, except that it asks states to determinethe effect on management capacity of all projected in-state waste, includingexports. The results of both Worksheets will be used to estimate capacityneed in Worksheet V-4.Calculating Hazardous Waste Management Capacity NeedsUsing Worksheet V-4, states must determine the amount of management capacitypotentially needed in the state over the next 20 years. In determiningthese needs, the state must make adjustments to account for on-site andcaptive handling and describe assumptions on waste imports and exports.<ITAG tagnum="81">Adjustments for On-Site and Captive Handling </ITAG>For purposes of assuring capacity, states can assume that all waste (orthe proportion of total waste) currently managed on-site will continueto be managed on-site, unless the state believes regulatory changes ormarket forces will alter this pattern. If such shifts are anticipated,states should document the assumptions leading to this conclusion. Similarly,states can assume that all waste (for the proportion of total waste) nowhandled in captive facilities will be handled in captive facilities inthe projection years. In either case, states should retrieve the appropriate data from ChapterIII, Worksheets III-3 and III-4 and present their best estimate of on-siteand captive handling in Worksheet V-4 (a separate worksheet for each projectionyear). The first row of Worksheet V-4 should be brought forward from thecolumn totals of Worksheets V-2 and V-3. <ITAG tagnum="81">Projecting Commercial Capacity Needs </ITAG>States should calculate their potential need for additional in-state wastemanagement capacity using the top block of rows in Worksheet V-4.  These calculations use the demand projection figures obtained from WorksheetV-2, which subtract the quantities of waste projected to be exported bythe state (see ``Projecting Exports,'' page V-7). To calculate ``TotalDemand With Imports, Excluding Exports,'' total demand estimates firstmust be transferred from the last row of Worksheet V-2 (for each appropriateprojection year). Capacity demand directed to on-site and captive facilitiesnext must be subtracted (see discussion above), and demand due to projectedwaste imports must be added. Projecting Waste Import Demand. States may hold imports constant to 1987levels_or allow them to grow_in their demand projections without providingadditional narrative to EPA. If imports are shown to decline. The assumptionof declining imports would be acceptable if it corresponds with CAP ofthe state exporting the waste, or if it is based on the importing state'sassumption that export practices from other states will change over timein accordance with the process of Appendix A. If an assumption of decliningimports is not supported by other states' CAPs, then the importing statemust fully document the basis of its assumption. Final Calculation of Demand. In estimating final demand, states may claimall available capacity projected as available through 1989, based on theiranalysis in Chapter III. Data on 1989 commercial capacity should be obtainedfrom Worksheet III-6. The predicted 1989 commercial capacity should besubtracted from the total commercial demand figures in Worksheet V-4 toobtain an estimate of capacity shortfall (or excess) in each projectionyear. These figures will form the basis of capacity need plans as describedin Chapter VI. Calculating the In-State Capacity Balance. The bottom block of rows inWorksheet V-4 are used to calculate the balance of total in-state commercialcapacity (excluding import demand) against total in-state waste generation(including potential waste exports). To complete these calculations, statesfirst should transfer the demand estimates from Worksheet V-3 (for eachappropriate year) to Worksheet V-4 (for each appropriate year). Subsequentcalculations then are similar to those described above (for the top blockof rows), except that import effects are neglected. The result of these calculations will be used by EPA to assess the effectof waste imports and exports on the commercial capacity contained in eachstate. They will not be used as a basis for assessing future need. Plans to Address Capacity Shortfalls States that show an excess of management capacity in Worksheet V-4 forthe projection years 1989, 1995, and 2009 are not required to present plansfor addressing capacity shortfalls. These states must only supply briefinformation in Chapter VI. States that show a shortfall of management capacity in Worksheet V-4 forprojection years 1989, 1995, and 2009 must describe their procedures inChapter VI to create new capacity through either new or expanded facilitiesin the state. States may choose not to meet the entire shortfall by creatingnew capacity. In this case they must revise their numbers for waste minimization(Chapter IV) and waste exports and recalculate Worksheet V-4.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Worksheet </T4>V-1._<T4>Summary of In-State Waste Quantities Produced in Projection Year __ </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[All in tons/year]  </ITAG><H1>Management Technology  </H1><H1>Projected Demand From Recurrent Waste Generation  </H1><H1>Adjustment of Waste Reduction  </H1><H1>Adjustment of Regulatory Change  </H1><H1>Demand from One-Time Waste </H1><H1>Total Demand (A+B+C+D)  </H1>  <ITAG tagnum="25">   <D>A  </D><D>B  </D><D>C  </D><D>D  </D><D>E  </D><R/></ITAG>1.

Becausethe CAP addresses a 20 year timeframe, most states will not have adequatecapacity in-place today to handle all the hazardous waste generated overthe next 20 years, making it necessary for States to document their proceduresto allow or facilitate capacity development.Chapter V of the guidance document asked each state to summarize theirprojected need for hazardous waste management capacity over the next twentyyears, after taking into account waste minimization efforts and waste exports.All states showing a shortfall in their hazardous waste management capacityin their projection years must describe their plans for addressing thisshortfall through their facility siting process and their procedures toprocess existing facility expansion applications. States projecting hazardouswaste capacity shortfalls within the projection period through 1995 alsomust report key interim and final siting milestones, such as site designation,permit submission, permit approval, and expected construction start.General InstructionsTo complete the requirements of this chapter, states should respond tothe questions contained in the attached forms. States should copy and completethe appropriate forms and include them in the CAP. Additional documentationshould be included as needed.Not all forms must be completed, States that project sufficient capacitythrough year 20 must only complete Form I, ``General Siting Description''.This form requests general information on state procedures that affector facilitate the development of new hazardous waste capacity. It coverssuch items as the state's general siting process, preemption and overrideauthority of local and state government, and laws that restrict the operationor configuration of a facility.States that project a capacity shortfall in any projection year after takinginto account waste minimization and waste exports must complete both FormI and Form II, ``Capacity Development Plans'', requests a more detaileddescription of topics covered under Form I.Finally, those states that project a shortfall in 1989 or 1995 must completeall forms up through Form III, ``Milestones and State Review''. This formrequests information on the state's anticipated progress in meeting itsshortfall.A glossary of the terms used in this Chapter is contained in the DefinitionSection at the end of the chapter. In addition, technical assistance isavailable from EPA in several forms. A Hotline at the Agency is availableduring the hours of XX and XX Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday.In addition, the EPA Regional Office serving your state has assigned severalindividuals to answer questions. Please consult the <T3>Technical Reference Manual </T3>for more details, including a listof individuals and phone numbers.Evaluation CriteriaThe EPA recognizes that many different state approaches exist for planningand overseeing the development of new hazardous waste management capacity.Each state has and probably will employ a different strategy to ensurethat it has adequate capacity now and in the future. The Agency thereforewill focus its evaluation on two key areas:<T2>andCx.1;</T2> the ability of a state program to allow or facilitate thedevelopment of adequate capacity when needed; and, <T2>andCx.1;</T2> The degree of a state's reliance on out-of-state capacityas a substitute for developing in-state capacity.If a state has shown in Chapter V that it plans to construct new capacityto meet projected needs, EPA will evaluate the ability of a state programto meet the expected shortfall. Because the Agency recognizes that statescan do many things to promote, facilitate, or simply allow the developmentof new capacity, the Agency will concentrate its review on items that mayindicate a flawed program or that actually hinder siting. Practices orpolicies that may either hinder new capacity development or indicate programdifficulties include the following:<T2>andCx.1;</T2> A state siting process that is subject to strong localpreemption powers not firmly gounded in environmental, health, and safetyconcerns. An inability of the state to appeal or rectify such preemption.<T2>andCx.1;</T2> The absence of a siting program having clearly definedsteps and procedures. A lack of sufficient opportunity for public reviewand comment. The absence of clear time lines between permit review, comment,and approval or denial.<T2>andCx.1;</T2> The enactment of rules that may be viewed as discriminatory,such as placing limits on facility size, type of waste allowed at the facilitybased on origin of the waste, or outright prohibition of waste managementfacilities if not based on environmental, health, and safety concerns.(This would not include limitations that may be agreed to by the facilitydeveloper and the host community as part of siting process negotiation.)<T2>andCx.1;</T2>A state having sufficient demand for new hazardous wastecapacity accompanied by a history of failed siting efforts.The Agency also will examine the states reliance on out-of-state hazardouswaste management capacity to determine if it conflicts with the requirementsset forth in Appendix A.<ITAG tagnum="71">Form I: General Siting Description </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All states must fill out this form.

The process includes site selection (whenrequired), application for the various required state, national, and localpermits, review of those applications by the appropriate government agenciesin accordance with criteria previously specified, hearings, other formsof public involvement where applicable (local advisory committees, negotiation),submission and review of application amendments and revisions, and finaldecision (approval or denial of the application).<T3>Siting Criteria. </T3>These are constraints and guidelines specifiedby each state for evaluating the suitability of individual sites proposedfor hazardous waste management facilities. These criteria can include outrightprohibitions against siting facilities in certain environments (in 100year flood plains) or can be more general and list the variables that shouldbe taken into consideration in evaluating proposed sites (population densityand evacuation plans).<T3>Milestone. </T3>This is a task or achievement to be accomplished bya specific point in time. Milestones can be stated quantitatively, suchas tons of incineration capacity in operation by a certain date, or canbe described qualitatively as unique policy components, such as implementationof certain defined procedures in a state siting program by a specifieddate.<T3>Needs Assessment. </T3>This is an evaluation of current and futureneeds for hazardous waste management capacity. An assessment includes estimationof current and projected future waste generation, evaluation of currentand imminent capacity, and calculation of capacity shortfalls or needsfor increased management capacity. It may also include an analysis of currentand suggested state policies in hazardous waste management. A needs assessmentprovides a basis for state planning for future hazardous waste management,helping the state to choose among alternative approaches to satisfyingdemand for sound management capacity, and publicizes the state's marketneeds to private sector suppliers. A needs assessment is a statement ofthe state's position in waste management and does not necessarily leadto the state's active involvement in capacity expansion or site selection.<T3>Negotiation. </T3>This consists of mediated and nonmediate interactionsbetween the proponents of a specific hazardous waste management facilityand representatives of the host community and other communities that arelikely to be affected by the proposed facility. Negotiation can entailclarification and resolution of issues and concerns, development of alternatives,and specification of compensation and mitigation measures accepted by bothparties. <T3>Compensation. </T3>This includes services and payments made to a hostcommunity and other affected communities to help allay burdens imposedby their proximity to a harzardous waste management facility. Compensationcan be cash payments (a given payments per ton processed) or provided in-kind(free clean-up of public hazardous waste spills, company maintenance ofaccess roads). <T3>Mitigation. </T3>These are measures implemented to minimize the impactof a hazardous waste facility on the surrounding population and the environment.Whereas compensation is meant to balance burdens, mitigation is intendedto reduce the burdens carried by host and nearby communities. Mitigationincludes restrictions on operating hours and procedures, limitations ontypes and volumes of waste accepted, stricter engineering specifications,and construction of additional safety features. <T3>Preemption. </T3>The state has the authority to make a decision inan area normally reserved for local or county government. That is, thestate substitutes its authority for local or county authority in a specifiedpolicy area so that a decision normally left to a lower level of governmentis taken at a higher level of government which is not required, under preemption,to defer to local preferences. <T3>Override. </T3>The state has the authority to overrule a decision madeat a lower level of government. With regard to hazardous waste management,the local jurisdiction first evaluates the case and makes a decision; thisdecision can then be appealed to the higher authority which has the rightto overturn the decision if it feels justified. <T3>Facility Expansion. </T3>This is any increase in capacity of an existinghazardous waste facility. This can refer to contruction of plant additionsor substitution of new equipment for older equipment with a concomitantability to handle greater volumes to waste. <T3>Siting Application. </T3>This is a request for state agency approvalof a specific hazardous waste facility on a designated site. Applicationcontains engineering specifications of the facility, description of wastesand technical processes, information on the developer, as well as environmentaland geological description of the site and surrounding area. <T3>Adjudicatory Hearing. </T3>This is a public hearing to gather evidenceand arrive at a decision on a proposed facility, structured like a judicialreview. Interested parties present evidence to influence the final decisionand are generally subject to cross examination as part of the process.Based on evaluation of the evidence presented the hearing examiner ruleson the suitability of the proposed facility (granting or denying a permit)or makes a recommendation to the permitting authority on whether or notthe facility should be approved. <T3>Informational Hearing. </T3>This is a public hearing for disseminationof information and airing of opinions on a proposed facility. Representativesof all interest parties can make presentations and discuss areas of concern;evidence is collected and turned over to permitting authories for consideration;the hearing administrator presides and ensures proper procedures but doesnot rule on the proposed facility.<ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix A._The Interstate Agreement and EPA's Role in Analyzing andResolving Interstate Issues</ITAG>This appendix outlines the procedure through which states that claim theavailability of out-of-state waste management capacity in their CAP canassure EPA of this availability. It establishes a system under which commercialmanagement capacity will be available on a national basis to all states,but includes a process to correct possible failures of net exporting states'to reduce out-of-state waste shipments because of a current and projectedlack of native waste management capacity (in the absence of economic andenvironmental reasons for its absence).SummaryThe process begins with the initial CAP submittal. Each CAP must be accompaniedby the Interstate Agreement of Chapter II signed by the Governor of thestate or designee. By executing the agreement, the Governor or designeeindicates an awareness of the current status quo of interstate waste shipments;promises participation in the EPA process to plan, analyze, and addressthe interstate transport and disposal of hazardous waste; and confirmsthe state's willingness to carry out the activities described in the CAP.The Agency then will institute the following procedures to address interstatewaste management issues:1. After submission of the CAPs in October 1989; EPA will prepare and publisha national analysis of the current and projected interstate waste flowscontained in each states' CAP.2. Based on the results of the first CAP submissions, EPA will refine thereasonableness criteria set forth in this appendix and publish them forreview and comment. The reasonableness criteria will be used, in part,to identify states showing high levels (in net terms) of waste exportspossibly due to capacity shortfall in the exporting state. States may bein ``violation'' of the reasonableness criteria if their export volumesare encouraged by state policies, if they are sufficient to support thedevelopment and operation of a commercial facility (for a particular wastestream), or if they result from state policies that discourage the creationof in-state management capacity. Violations would not apply to states thathave entered into arrangements with other states supporting these exportpractices, that intend to lower waste exports through waste minimizationor through new or expanded capacity, or that export waste in quantitiesnot sufficient to support a commercial treatment or disposal facility.To help in the analysis of potential export violations, EPA will publishinitial estimates of waste stream volumes sufficient to support developmentand operation of a new commercial management facility under acceptablepractices. These estimates will be used as guidelines for further analysisand cannot, in themselves, be used to determine violations. Actual violationsof the reasonableness criteria will be determined by EPA only, as describedin Step 5.3. A forum (or forums) to raise and discuss interstate issues will be convenedunder the auspices of EPA. This forum will be used to address the reasonablenesscriteria published by EPA and to identify those states that may be in violation.States will be encouraged to resolve possible violations by entering intomulti-state planning efforts and by revising their initial CAP submissions.The nature of the forum (or forums) will be determined by EPA after publicationof the initial CAP analysis and refinement of the reasonableness criteria.4. If interstate issues between affected states cannot be resolved throughdiscussion, a process for resolving such issues will be implemented underthe auspices of EPA at the request of the states affected. This processmay include third-party facilitation, mediation, arbitration, or otherinformal dispute resolution mechanisms.5. States will be given an opportunity to revise their initial CAPs tocorrect possible violations of the reasonableness criteria identified inSteps 3 and 4. If, after a specified period of time, potential violationsand disputes cannot be resolved, EPA_upon a petition from an affected stateor on its own initiative_will conduct an adjudication (which may includefact-finding) to determine whether any state is engaging in actions violatingthe reasonableness criteria. If EPA concludes that the actions are notconsistent with the reasonableness criteria, EPA will withdraw approvalof the offending state's CAP, which may result in withholding of Superfundmonies.6. If a state continues to violate the reasonableness criteria, and suchactions jeopardize an importing state's ability to assure capacity, theimporting state eventually may take appropriate action to limit the offendingquantity of waste from the exporting state. These actions would not befound to be ``inconsistent'' under RCRA if prior approval of such actionswere obtained from EPA. EPA would allow such actions only under the mostnarrow of circumstances.This above process only addresses issues relating to interstate transportand disposal of waste. Compliance with this section alone does not assureadequate capacity or complete a CAP submission. Other criteria also mustbe fulfilled (as listed in Chapter I) to fulfill the requirements of aCAP.BackgroundSection 104(k) of SARA requires states to assure the availability of adequatewaste treatment or disposal facilities which ``are within the state oroutside the state in accordance with an interstate agreement or regionalagreement or authority''. EPA interprets this provision as providing theAgency with discretion in defining an interstate agreement that would meetthe requirements of the law. Such discretion is needed to construct anagreement that takes into account the following:andbullet; States, for the most part, do not control the amount of commercialhazardous waste management capacity available. The amount and locationof waste management capacity chiefly is determined by private market decisions,which include considerations of market volumes available to the facility.States, however, can influence these decisions to expand or build new capacityby supporting policies that may either hinder or facilitate the developmentof management capacity in that state.andbullet; Some states are net exporters of hazardous waste while othersare net importers. But virtually all states both receive and ship somehazardous waste. For the commercial hazardous waste management industryto operate most efficiently, unreasonable barriers to the interstate flowof waste cannot be permitted. (By ``state'', we mean chiefly the wastegeneration and management industry contained in the state. Governmentscreate waste only if the waste is generated by a government facility orif it arises from government-funded cleanups.)andbullet; Some states that receive substantial net imports of hazardouswaste believe such imports may arise partly from practices in other statesthat hinder the creation of their own waste management capacity. Theseimporting states believe greater pressure should be placed on the appropriateexporting states to create the needed capacity.andbullet; Many net exporting states do not export in quantities sufficientto support a commercial management facility. These states must rely onout-of-state capacity or be forced to construct uneconomical facilities.The requirement that such states build new management capacity to supporttheir own waste to assure capacity would not be appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">Problems of Requiring Each State To Execute a Formal Agreement WithAnother State</ITAG>In developing an approach to assuring out-of-state capacity, EPA neededto reconcile the above practical concerns against the ostensible mandateof SARA Section 104(k)(9), which requires states relying on out-of-statecapacity to do so pursuant to an interstate agreement or regional authority.While most states appear to be willing to accept the status quo of interstatewaste management, few_if any_appear willing to sign unconditional agreementsguaranteeing that they will hold their borders open to imports of hazardouswaste. The reason for this is that such agreements would hold little promisethat was volumes to the importing state would, in fact, be reduced overtime. Instead, by not signing such an agreement, the importing state forcesthe affected exporting states to reduce their exports or face potentialdisapproval of its CAP and, thus, loss of Superfund monies. The resultmight be greater amounts of Superfund monies available to the importingstates that can assure capacity.Moreover, the failure of several key states to execute a binding agreementwith the states that import waste to them eventually could undermine theeffectuation of the provision. Most states, even net importers, exportsignificant quantities of waste to other states. If only a few importingstates refuse to sign such agreements, it could create a series of reactionsthat would be difficult to sort out. (For example, in 1986, Illinois received68,587,000 gallons of waste from 42 states and sent 21,590,000 gallonsof waste to 28 states).Finally, coupled with the above considerations is the Agency's belief thatbarriers to interstate waste shipments also can undermine the intent ofSARA 104(k)(9) by forcing states to manage all waste created within itsborders, even when it is uneconomical to do so. Such a result would obviatethe efficiencies of a national market for waste management. Yet, by requiringstates to execute explicit ``assurances'' with each other, many stateswith small quantities of exports could be forced to create unnecessarymanagement capacity if they cannot obtain agreements with importing states.The Agency did not wish to sanction a process that might encourage sucha response.<ITAG tagnum="81">The Benefits of Requiring States To ``Sign On'' to a Common ProcessThat Assures Capacity</ITAG>It was the judgement of the Agency that it was essential to bring all statesfully into the program in a progressive way. The option chosen is to requirestates to enter into a process that results in equitable considerationof interstate issues. The agreement fashioned is one that places all statesunder a common system; the Agency believes the common principles that bindall states under the agreement would motivate all to sign. This is, inpart, because the process associated with the agreement provides a fairmechanism for raising, discussing, analyzing, resolving, and adjudicatinginterstate disputes. However, to ensure that all states do sign, the Agencyrequires that the agreement be executed by all states exporting waste atany time over the 20-year projection horizon of the CAP. EPA considersthis a necessary step toward submitting an approvable CAP.While the agreement set forth in this Guidance is the minimum requiredagreement, it should be emphasized that more concrete bilateral or multi-stateagreements are encouraged and are not precluded under this process. Infact, it is hoped that the process will facilitate states to engage injoint planning efforts which may eventually lead to regional agreements.The process outlined in this appendix constitutes an attempt to reconcileall of the above-mentioned practical concerns. The process is intendedto result in agreements regarding interstate movement of waste that arenonbinding between states, but satisfy the intent of the Section 104(k)(9).The consequence of failing to enter into the agreement or failing to abideby the process is that a state may lose funding under the Superfund cooperativeagreements. No state can enforce the agreements other than by requestingthat EPA take action. EPA's role will be to perform an initial analysisof the CAPs, refine the reasonableness criteria that will be used to assessthe actions of significant exporting states, convene a forum for airinginterstate issues, help set up informal mechanisms for resolving disputes,and, finally, act on petitions submitted by affected states where disputescannot be resolved informally.While EPA plans to facilitate the resolution of interstate issues, it willnot micro-manage the disposition of waste or prescribe waste managementpractices in individual states. Instead, EPA's role will be limited todetermining whether a state is acting in accordance with the reasonablenesscriteria and, if not, whether the CAP should be disapproved. If the CAPis not approved, EPA can withhold Superfund monies as appropriate. EPAalso plans only to facilitate resolution of significant disputes, whenlarge quantities of waste are being exported and when an exporting stateis not meeting the milestones in its CAP or is otherwise taking actionthat encourages exports at the expense of creating additional capacity.The only actions affecting waste movement and disposition that EPA guidancewould recognize as valid (pursuant to the process) are narrowly targetedactions to limit imports of hazardous waste when the importing state isin serious jeopardy of not adequately assuring capacity. Such actions maybe considered a lawful exercise of police power authority as reasonablyrelated both to avoidance of a specific harm (the potential cutoff of moneynecessary to clean up toxic sites) and compliance with a federal statute.In addition, the fact that such limited, narrowly targeted actions wouldbe taken under the authority of a federal statute, as implemented by afederal agency, lends additional legitimacy to the actions. Such actions,as outlined in this appendix, would be permitted only under the most extremeof circumstances and only after resolution mechanisms have been implementedand failed.<ITAG tagnum="81">Fulfilling the Intent of the Law</ITAG>The agency believes the intent, if not the literal mandate, of section104(k)(9) would be satisfied by the process chosen. By executing the agreementof Chapter I, each state would acknowledge the status quo of interstatewaste shipments and would participate in a process to address disputesover access to capacity. Thus, the agreement would provide the assurancesthat capacity was available now and would be available in the future. Theprocess is one that is effectuated by a federal agency pursuant to itsauthority to implement SARA. Thus, the agreements and the process are conceivedas the implementing mechanism of EPA and do not constitute binding agreementsthat rise to the level of an interstate compact.Finally, this process may provide a more effective means of resolving interstateissues than arise under RCRA and the requirement in RCRA that state programsbe consistent. EPA's recent experience with this issue shows the difficultyof entering into adjudication without clearly defined criteria and withoutan attempt to first discuss the real issues. The process set forth thereinattempts to fill these gaps in the current RCRA regulatory scheme. TheRCRA requires a regulatory decision without a process that allows fullexposition of the facts relating to all of the state's activities. By contrast,the process set forth in this guidance anticipates a regulatory decisiononly as a last resort. Prior to any decision, there will have been a reviewand discussion of the entire state program, and development of specificevidence that a state is not issuing permits for new capacity despite existingmarkets for such capacity, and that the state's action is specificallyburdening another state.The ProcessThe following sections illustrate implementation of the process over afour-year time frame. Most of the key activities will begin immediatelyupon submission of the initial CAPs and will be in-place at the end ofthe first year. Many of the resolution efforts, however, will be ongoing.<ITAG tagnum="81">Initial Assurance Plan_1989</ITAG>The initial assurance submission will concentrate on each state supplyingthe best possible information on its current and projected waste generationand how that waste will be served by the current and projected managementcapacity of the state. In estimating their waste flows, states will beallowed to hold imports at current levels and continue to export wasteaccording to current patterns if these assumptions are reasonable. Stateswill be required to document expected exports and their disposition, butwill not be expected to obtain assurances from each state.All Governors (or their designates) will provide with their initial assurancesubmissions a signed agreement stating the following:1. The government of the state is aware of the status quo of interstatewaste shipments;2. In accordance with other state agreements, the government of the stateagrees to participate in the planning, analysis, and dispute resolutionprocess designed to address interstate transport and disposal of hazardouswaste as outlined in the waste capacity assurance guidelines; and3. The government of the state intends to carry out the activities describedin the assurance plan, which will include programs and/or milestones relevantto waste minimization and management of hazardous waste.This signed agreement from the Governors, agreeing to participate in theprocess and acknowledging the status quo of interstate waste movements,will serve as the interstate agreement required under section 104(k)(9).This process referred to in the agreement (as described herein) would notmake any affirmative allowances for the erection of barriers to interstatemovement of waste until at least four years after the first CAP submittal,and then only if specific conditions or criteria are satisfied. The initialagreement contained in this first assurance submittal will remain in effectand will be required as a condition of EPA acceptance of a state's capacityassurance plan (CAP) with regard to interstate capacity.<ITAG tagnum="81">Second Year_1990</ITAG>EPA will prepare and publish an analysis of data submitted with the initialCAPs from each state. The analysis will highlight interstate waste flows.EPA will then publish for notice and comment a refinement of the reasonablenesscriteria set forth in this Appendix. The refined reasonableness criteriawill include guidelines published by the agency indicating waste streamvolumes sufficient to support development and operation of a new commercialmanagement facility under acceptable practices. These guidelines will beused to highlight so-called ``high volume'' net exports that could subjecta state to further review under this process. By themselves, however, theguidelines would not be used to determine violations of the reasonablenesscriteria.A forum (or forums) will be convened under the auspices of EPA to discussEPA's analysis and any interstate issues which arise out of the comparisonof waste flows against the reasonableness criteria. This forum will beused to examine further the application of all of the reasonableness criteria.It is anticipated that his forum will identify certain state waste streamsand corresponding waste management practices which should be subject tofurther examination. Among other outcomes, regional planning efforts willbe encouraged. One important aspect of the reasonableness criteria is thata state's waste exports and waste management practices will not be deemedunreasonable if they are subject to regional planning efforts or interstateor regional agreements. It is further anticipated that in cases for whichpotential violations have been identified, the affected states will conductfurther examinations and will attempt to discuss these problems directlywith the exporting states in question. EPA also may conduct further examinationof the most potentially serious problems.States will not be authorized to rescind the initial agreements (in thesense that EPA would not use the rescission at this time as a basis fora finding that state CAPs are unacceptable). Instead, as a result of theinitial forum, EPA may, at the request of affected states, require certainstates to take appropriate corrective actions (where there are clear violationsof the reasonableness criteria) or provide reports of progress in meetingthe milestones in order to facilitate analysis of progress over the comingyear.<ITAG tagnum="81">Third Year_1991</ITAG>In the third year, the forum will be convened for a second time to consideractions over the past year to resolve interstate issues. This meeting willoccur after the 1989 biennial report cycle has been completed. Progressin meeting milestones related to siting and waste minimization and otherwisereducing exported waste volumes will be examined for those states identifiedas violating the reasonableness criteria. Informal alternative disputeresolution mechanisms will be implemented under the auspices of EPA todevelop discrete solutions between affected states.If the interstate issues cannot be resolved by agreements worked out betweenthe affected states within a specified period of time, EPA, on its own,or pursuant to a petition submitted by an affected state, will determinewhether an ``offending'' state is failing to comply with the ``reasonableness''criteria. EPA's determination will take into account the ``offending''state's adherence to milestones set forth in the initial capacity assuranceplan. If EPA determines that the ``reasonableness'' criteria are not beingmet, it will issue such a determination and indicate that if the ``offending''state fails to take specified actions within a specified period of time,EPA will deem the state's capacity assurance plan to be inadequate. Ifthe state fails to come into compliance, EPA will deem the capacity assuranceplan inadequate. This finding will result in withholding of Superfund moneyin the year following its failure to achieve compliance.EPA's determination that a state's capacity assurance plan is not adequatewill be taken after notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and an opportunity for the affected state tosubmit comments. The final determination will be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and will constitute final agency action, permittingthe affected state to seek judicial review in a federal district court.<ITAG tagnum="81">Fourth Year and Beyond</ITAG>If, despite EPA's final action to disapprove an exporting state's capacityassurance plan, the state continues to export significant quantities ofwaste to an ``aggrieved'' state, the aggrieved state may find it necessaryto control imported waste from the exporting state. This situation willarise if the quantity of wastes exported into the ``aggrieved'' state significantlyand adversely affects the ability of the ``aggrieved'' state to assurecapacity for the waste generated within its borders. If this can be demonstrated,the ``aggrieved'' state may submit a revised capacity assurance plan whichcontains a restriction on the amount of waste imported from the exportingstate, implemented through legislation or regulations. Such restrictionswill only be allowed on the amount of waste specifically found to threatenthe ``aggrieved'' state's capacity; unless, otherwise demonstrated, thisamount will be defined as the excess of that received by the ``aggrieved''state in 1987 (as described in the 1989 CAP of that state).EPA, pursuant to this guidance and after notice and comment, will approvethe capacity assurance plan with the restriction on imported waste if theAgency agrees with the aggrieved state's determination that_without theproposed restriction on the exporting state's waste_the importing state'sability to assure capacity would be seriously jeopardized. EPA would notfind such action to be inconsistent with RCRA, regardless of what consistencycriteria may be developed by EPA.The imprimatur for the affected state to restrict imports from a particularexporting state comes under section 104(k)(9), as implemented by the guidanceand also as necessary to assure safe and effective management capacityfor the state. It is provided only under the most narrow of circumstances,and only as a last resort. The state taking action must demonstrate toEPA that the action is necessary for it to demonstrate adequate capacityto dispose of in-state generated wastes.<ITAG tagnum="81">``Reasonableness'' Criteria</ITAG>The reasonableness criteria are intended to define the circumstances underwhich state action will be found to be inadequate to satisfy EPA's capacityassurance guidance with respect to out-of-state capacity. The criteriaare intended to help identify instances in which a state might be foundto place undue reliance on out-of-state waste management capacity as asubstitute for creating necessary in-state capacity. Such criteria arenot intended to penalize state's that have insufficient waste volumes tosupport a commercial facility, that have agreements or planning effortswith other states to support such waste management patterns, or that arenet exporters of waste because of in-state industry shipments to captivefacilities in other states.Within the first year of the initial CAP submission, a review panel ofstate, federal, industry, and other interested parties will refine thedefinitions and terms of the so-called ``reasonableness'' criteria. Thereasonableness criteria will include, but not be limited to, the followingprinciples:1. It is unreasonable for a state that needs to create capacity (as definedbelow) to fail to create that capacity for whatever reason.2. A state will be deemed to need to create capacity under the followingconditions:a. It is exporting significant quantities of waste (by waste stream) inexcess of that being imported to and managed by the state for treatmentor disposal, or it is otherwise exporting quantities that adversely affectanother state's CAP;b. It is economically feasible to create and maintain a commercial or publicfacility (including optimum use of mobile incineration technology) to disposeor treat the waste in question; and,c. it is unable to demonstrate that:i. It has entered into any multi-state or regional planning efforts thatallow it to maintain its level of exports;ii. Its failure to reduce its waste exports is caused by special environmental,health, or safety conditions significantly more serious than those existingin other states; andiii. It has procedures in place that are likely to create capacity withina specified period of time.3. ``Creating capacity'' means:a. Reduction of waste generated in-state through waste minimization programs;b. Use of out-of-state facilities pursuant to interstate or regional agreementsor planning efforts; orc. Construction of new or expanded waste treatment or disposal facilities.4. For those states that export (in net terms) significant quantities ofwaste, it shall be considered unreasonable if the State has incentivesin place to encourage in-State generators to export waste.<ITAG tagnum="85">ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS ON DRAFT STATE HAZARDOUS WASTE CAPACITYASSURANCE GUIDANCE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Chapter I_Introduction and Overview of the Capacity Assurance Process</ITAG>This document provides guidance to State officials on how to prepare aState Capacity Assurance Plan (CAP). The CAP provides the documentationnecessary to provide the assurances required by Section 104(c)(9) of theComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA),as amended (Pub. L. 96-510). This section requires each State to assurethe Administrator that adequate capacity will exist to manage the hazardouswaste created in the State over the next twenty years (see box below).A State's failure to submit an approved CAP by the October 1989 deadlinewill prohibit the State from receiving Superfund money for remedial actionsuntil such time an assurance is approved by EPA. The availability of fundsfor emergency removal actions is not affected by this requirement.``Siting._Effective 3 years after enactment of the Superfund Amendmentsand the Reauthorization Act of 1986, the President shall not provide anyremedial actions pursuant to this section unless the State in which therelease occurs first enters into a contract or cooperative agreement withthe President providing assurances deemed adequate by the President thatthe State will assure the availability of hazardous waste treatment ordisposal facilities which_(A) Have adequate capacity for the destruction, treatment, or secure dispositionof all hazardous wastes that are reasonably expected to be generated withthe State during the 20-year period following the date of such contractor cooperative agreement and to be disposed of, treated, or destroyed,(B) Are within the State or outside the State in accordance with an interstateagreement or regional agreement or authority,(C) Are acceptable to the President, and(D) Are in compliance with the requirements of subtitle C of the SolidWaste Disposal Act.''_Section 104(k) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of1986 amending Section 104(c) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (commonly known as the ``Superfund'').40 U.S.C. 9604(c)(9).Legislative Background on CERCLA Section 104(c)(9)The Congress added these requirements to CERCLA through the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). The purpose of this provision wasstraightforward: Superfund money should not be spent in States that aretaking insufficient steps to avoid the creation of future Superfund sites.The Congress recognized that a safe and rational hazardous waste managementprogram for the nation depended in part of the creation of new facilitiesemploying the most advanced technologies. While many States enacted orplanned to enact siting legislation, Congress concluded that few, if any,were developing policies and siting programs that would assure continuedfacility capacity in the long term.Congress stressed that a successful State siting program should recognizethree key principles. First, the program should require a complete technicalanalysis of all proposed sites prior to their selection. Second, site selectionmust be accompanied by full public participation. Third, the process ofsite selection should find a way to transcend blanket local vetoes. TheCongress further stressed, however, that merely having such programs inplace would not satisfy the requirements of this section. Each State mustprovide assurances that their legislative program can work and will beused. The siting process may differ between States, but each program shouldmake the best use of existing facilities in the short term and assure continuedfacility capacity in the long term.Finally, Congress did not envision that every State would need to developredundant or unneeded capacity. A site in every State is not required.In some cases, multi-State efforts may be appropriate, requiring some assurancethat access exists to out-of-State facilities. Such access is to be assuredthrough ``an interstate agreement or regional agreement or authority.''In passing this statute, Congress did not explicitly address what shouldconstitute a State assurance to EPA. Much was left to interpretation. Moreover,the nature of the data available, the interstate market, and methods topredict future waste generation demand a flexible approach in interpretingand implementing this requirement.In EPA's view, the CAP should serve a twofold purpose. First, it shouldeffectively demonstrate to the Agency that each State is taking measuresto ensure that the hazadous waste created within its borders is and willbe effectively managed. Second, the CAP should serve as a document to educateand inform the public on the State's strategy for managing the hazardouswaste generated by its industry and other sources.EPA and State Responsibilities in Implementing the CERCLA 104(C)(9) RequirementsThe Agency is responsible for developing a procedure for implementing therequirements of CERCLA Section 104(c)(9). The Administrator plans to carryout this process through three major efforts: (1) Publish guidance explaininghow to prepare a State Waste Capacity Assurance Plan (CAP) for submissionto EPA; (2) provide technical assistance and limited financial resourcesto the States; and (3) review and approve the State submissions. States,for their part, are responsible for full and accurate submissions. In evaluatingsubmissions, EPA intends to return to the States any which include volumeestimates which are inconsistent with other States with whom they haveimport/export relationships. In this process, EPA will certainly applya rule of reason: since many States will have reciprocal relationshipswith a number of other States, EPA generally, will confine its examinationfor consistent estimates to the top five volume import and export Statesfor each submission.Because of the many complex issues involved, EPA sought the advice of Stateofficials, industry, private citizens, and public interest groups as partof developing this guidance package. The recommendations contained in thisdocument reflect the views of these affected parties and specifically addressthe following problem areas:andbullet; Data used throughout the States varies in uniformity. To helpStates convert their data to a uniform and consistent format for reportingpurposes, EPA will provide technical assistance for States that use theNew Biennial Report System, the Old Biennial Report System, or equivalentdata from State reports or manifest data.andbullet; Waste projections techniques are uncertain and under development.To accommodate the different approaches available to project waste generation,the guidance permits States to develop their own procedures as long asthey meet general criteria.andbullet; Waste minimization is a valuable waste management tool but itsresults are difficult to predict. To encourage States to develop wasteminimization programs, the assurance process grants maximum flexibilityto States in calculating the effects of such programs on the demand forfuture management capacity.andbullet; The current waste management market is multi-State, and privately-runfor the most part. To allow States to effectively assure the availabilityof capacity in other States without executing complicated interstate agreements,the guidance requires States to resolve interstate waste management issues.Evaluation Criteria To Be Used by EPATo comply with CERCLA Section 104(c)(9), each State must complete the reportingrequirements outlined in this guidance document. The CAP submitted by theState will not be approved unless it meets the following criteria:1. The State must submit complete and accurate information showing currentgeneration, waste management capacity, imports, and exports.(a) Full and accurate submissions shall constitute those in which a Statedemonstrates its ability to coordinate with import and export partnersin developing consistent estimates of waste volumes; as noted above, EPAwill return to the States for review submissions containing inconsistencies,particularly those involving large waste volumes.2. The State must show that its projection of waste generation and demandcapacity:(a) Is based on existing or official projections of State economic activityor are otherwise justified by the State; (b) Accounts for major waste producing industries and takes into accountthe range of possible changes in the economic behavior of these industries;(c) Accounts for one-time only wastes (e.g., CERCLA or RCRA remedial correctiveactions); and (d) Incorporates effects of waste minimization as outlined in the State'splan. 3. For States that rely on waste minimization to reduce the demand forcapacity, the State must demonstrate that: (a) The estimated reductions in wastes are based on a sound technical analysis,such as surveys of specific industries and engineering analysis of potentialreductions; (b) The resources committed to implementing the waste minimization strategyare consistent with the plan set forth by the State; and, (c) The milestones for projected accomplishments in waste minimizationare reasonable and there is a plan for action if the milestones are notmet. 4. States must execute the interstate agreement set forth in Chapter IIif they plan to use management capacity in other States at any time overthe 20-year ``assurance'' timeframe. 5. For States showing capacity shortfalls in its projections, the Statemust meet the following requirements: (a) It must submit a plan and milestones for creating additional capacityinside the State or otherwise show how capacity needs will be addressedthrough interstate or regional planning efforts: (b) If additional capacity is to be created inside the State, the CAP mustshow that State and local laws, regulations, practices, and policies willnot hinder the development of additional capacity, when needed, and areconsistent with the proposed plan submitted under (a) above. Laws, regulations,policies, and practices that may be found to hinder development of additionalcapacity include, but are not limited to the following: (i) Local preemption powers not based on environment, health, or safetyconcerns with no ability for the State to appeal or rectify local decisions;(ii) Absence of a siting procedure with clearly defined steps, includingopportunity for public review and comment, and clear time periods betweenpermit review, comment, and approval/denial; (iii) Discriminatory rules such as limits on facility size, types of wasteallowed based on origin of waste, and prohibition of waste facilities notbased on environmental, health, or safety considerations; and (iv) A demonstrated history of failed efforts to create additional capacityin the presence of sufficient demand for that capacity. (c) For States that plan to rely upon capacity outside the State to addressthe projected shortfall, the CAP must show that such reliance does notconflict with the plans of the State receiving the waste. EPA expects the States to prepare and submit an assurance to the Administratorno later than October 17, 1989. EPA plans to request revised assurancesevery two years, in concert with the biennial report already required ofTSD facilities. Thus, the first reassurance will be required in Octoberof 1991. Each time a State enters into a cooperative agreement with EPAto obligate Superfund monies, the State must certify that their currentassurance represents current policy to the best of their understanding.EPA will establish a standard certification paragraph on compliance withCERCLA section 104(c)(9), in compliance with RCRA Subtitle C, which willappear on all CERCLA cooperative agreements for remedial action funding.Interstate Dialogue and Coordination EPA recognizes that many States presently depend to some extent on hazardouswaste treatment and/or disposal capacity in other States. In order to meetthe CERCLA section 104(c)(9) requirements for an acceptable capacity assurance,waste exported by one State for treatment and/or final disposition in anotherState must be acknowledged and documented by the ``importing'' State inits own capacity assurance plan (CAP). Therefore, States which either exportor import significant amounts of waste to or from another State (or States),are advised to begin dialogue and information exchange relative to theseissues well in advance of the October 19, 1989 deadline for submissionof their CAPs to EPA. Such exchanges should include information on bothpresent and projected imports and/or exports between States reasonablyanticipated through the 20-year period requirement under CERCLA section104(c)(9). Consideration should be given to the compatibility of each State'sprojection methodology, as well as any projected waste minimization and/orsource reduction. Agreement and acceptance of the data and projectionsmay require substantial negotiations among importing exporting States.It should be noted that after the October 17, 1989 statutory deadline failureof an exporting State to obtain such an agreement will result in the lossof remedial action funding for the exporting State unless the State cansuccessfully conclude an equivalent interstate agreement with another Statewith demonstrated capacity sufficient to manage the exporters needs. Reasonable Levels of Exports In order to promote interstate dialogue, EPA suggests that States use thefollowing criteria as a starting point for determining what constitutesa ``reasonable'' level of exports: 1. It is unreasonable for a State that needs to create capacity (as definedbelow) to fail to create that capacity for whatever reason. 2. A State will be deemed as needing to create capacity under the followingconditions: (a) It is exporting significant quantities of waste (by waste stream) inexcess of that being imported to or managed by the State for treatmentor disposal or it is otherwise exporting quantities which adversely affectanother State's CAP; and (b) It is economically feasible to create and maintain a commercial orpublic facility (including optimum use of mobile incineration technology)to dispose of or treat the waste in question, and; (c) The State is unable to demonstrate that: (i) It has entered into any multi-State or regional planning effort whichallow it to maintain its level of exports; or, (ii) Its failure to reduce its waste exports is caused by special environmental,health, or safety considerations significantly more serious than thoseexisting in other States; or, (iii) It has procedures in place that are likely to create capacity withina specified period of time. 3. ``Creating capacity'' means: (a) Reduction of waste generated in-State through waste minimization programs;(b) Use of out-of-State facilities pursuant to interstate or regional agreementsor planning efforts; or (c) Construction of new or expanded waste treatment or disposal facilities.4. For those States that export (in net terms) significant quantities ofwaste, it shall be considered unreasonable if the State has incentivesin place to encourage in-State generators to export waste. EPA Administrative Assistance EPA, through the Regional offices, will provide administrative assistanceto assist States in these dialogues to facilitate timely assurances. Suchassistance will include convening of interstate and regional workgroups,regional import/export data access and manipulation and facilitation services.This support is already available in several Regions (specifically IV andX) and should be funded in other Regions by the end of this fiscal year.In addition, assistance is expected to be available to western States throughan EPA grant to the Western Governors' Association. Several State pilotprojects are also in progress, the results of which will be made availableto all States to aid in completing their assurances.   <ITAG tagnum="85">Chapter II_Basic Instructions for Completing the State Capacity AssurancePlan</ITAG>This chapter provides States with the basic instructions needed to completetheir Capacity Assurance Plan (CAP) in accordance with this guidance document.Each chapter in the guidance provides specific instructions for reportinginformation to EPA. This chapter outlines the format of the CAP, directionsfor completing the interstate agreement, technical assistance providedby EPA to complete portions of the CAP, and instructions for transmittingthe State's final CAP to EPA.Capacity Assurance Plan FormatThe State should submit its CAP to EPA as a single document consistingof five Parts, based on the information required in the guidance document:andbullet; Part 1 should contain the results of Chapter III of the guidancedocument, which requests information on current generation, managementcapacity, imports and exports. This chapter asks each State to demonstratean understanding of its current hazardous waste generation, treatment anddisposal system, and provides a format for all States to manipulate theirdata internally and report key information to EPA.andbullet; Part 2 should incorporate the results of Chapter IV of the GuidanceDocument concerning State waste minimization plans. This Part will provideinformation on each State's use of waste minimization in the capacity assuranceprocess. States that plan to use waste minimization to help them assurethe availability of adequate management capacity must supply more detaileddocumentation on their on-going and planned efforts.andbullet; Part 3 should incorporate the results of Chapter V of the GuidanceDocument, which requires States to project hazardous waste generation andthe demand for management capacity. This chapter also requires States toestimate the amount of capacity needed in the State over the next 20 years.andbullet; Part 4 should incorporate the results of Chapter VI of the GuidanceDocument, which covers State laws and procedures for creating managementcapacity within the State. All States showing a shortfall in managementcapacity in Part 3 must describe their plans for addressing this shortfallin this Part.The Interstate AgreementSection 104(c)(9) of CERCLA requires States to assure the availabilityof adequate waste treatment or disposal facilities which ``are within theState or outside the State in accordance with an interstate agreement orregional agreement or authority.'' EPA has determined that this interstateagreement must acknowledge current as well as projected hazardous wasteimports and exports and their treatment and/or disposal disposition. Itis expected that the governor or his/her designee will recognize the presentwaste handling practices in their State as outlined in their capacity assuranceplan as developed in accordance with these documents. To the extent thatthose waste handling practices involve treatment and/or disposal in anotherState, the CERCLA section 104(c)(9) assurance can be made by the exportingState only if the importing State accepts the fact of that treatment and/ordisposal within its capacity assurance plan.States can fulfill the requirements of CERCLA section 104(c)(9) with regardto out-of-State capacity by executing an interstate agreement as providedon pages II-3, 4, and 5 of this chapter. Two types of interstate agreementsare suggested. Once, a generic agreement, can be completed where therehas been adequate dialogue between importing and exporting States and importingState's capacity assurance plan adequately describes its hazardous wastemanagement system including treatment/disposal of the exporting Stateswastes. EPA encourages all States to negotiate generic agreements usingcriteria such as that recommended in Chapter 1 for determining reasonablelevels of exports.Certain groups of States may want to reach agreements that go beyond thelanguage suggested by the generic agreement. These groups of States areencouraged to develop separate addenda or other separate agreements inaddition to the generic interstate agreement that satisfy their regionalconcerns.In some instances, an exporting State may be unable to obtain or negotiatea generic agreement. In this case the State should negotiate separate ``one-on-one''agreements with States that have adequate excess capacity. A model ``one-on-one''agreement is provided for this purpose. <ITAG tagnum="81">Generic Interstate Agreement</ITAG>Pursuant to the requirements of the section 104(c)(9) of the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and the State HazardousWaste Capacity Assurance Guidance issued by the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency pursuant thereto; andIn recognition of the fact that this State is both an importer and exporterof hazardous waste; andIn accordance with similar agreements on behalf of other State governmentsrespecting interstate transport and disposal of hazardous waste:The State of ______ hereby agrees as follows:1.

Thisis the critical information required in Chapter III (Part 1 or the CAP)and used in all subsequent calculations concerning future waste managementpractices. EPA realizes that developing this information may be difficultfor some States because of differences in data collection and managementsystems. To help States complete Chapter III of the Guidance Document,and to ensure that all States assemble data into the same format for theCAP, EPA has provided three forms of technical assistance. This assistanceis located in a Technical Reference Manual, which will be issued by EPAin October, 1988.The Technical Reference Manual will cover the following major topics:1. Optional conversion methodologies will be detailed to allow the morethan 700 RCRA waste codes to be aggregated into 17 common reporting categoriesused in the CAP. These conversion methodologies will allow States usingthe New Biennial Report, the Old Biennial Report (including comparabledata obtained from State reports and manifests), and the California UCDcodes to convert their waste data into 17 common categories.2. An optional default methodology will be described to allow States toassign the 17 waste categories to the 15 waste management categories usedin the CAP. This default methodology will be based on current waste managementpractices; States will be free to choose different alternatives and mustadjust the default methodology for when used to project future practices.3. A procedure will be described for converting EPA-supplied data on wastemanagement capacity in your State (by facility ID number) to the 14 wastemanagement categories of the CAP. The facility-by-facility informationwill be supplied under separate cover and will include information on facilitystatus (on-site, commercial, or captive) and capacity (currently used,currently available, and future plans). States will be required to review,correct, and assemble this information for reporting their capacity needs.Finally, EPA will be developing computer-based programs to facilitate thecalculations described in the Technical Reference Manual and will be madeavailable in the fall of 1988.Additional technical assistance can be obtained by using the EPA Hotline,which is available during the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. EasternStandard Time, Monday through Friday. In addition, the EPA Regional Officeserving your States has assigned several individuals to answer questions.Please consult the Technical Reference Manual for more details, includinga list of individuals and phone numbers.Transmittal of Capacity Assurance Plan to EPABy Executive Order andplusmin;12580, the President has delegated approvalof the CIRCLA section 104(c)(9) assurances to the Administrator of theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Using the evaluation criteria discussedin Chapter 1 as a basis, EPA regional and headquarters personnel will evaluatethe Capacity Assurance Plans in making a recommendation for final agencydecision.It is expected that the Governor of each State will transmit its State'sCapacity Assurance Plan and Interstate Agreement to the EPA Administrator.These documents should be transmitted to EPA on or before October 17, 1989.A suggested transmittal letter for States to use in transmitting theirCapacity Assurance Plan is shown on Page II-8.Five copies of CAP should be sent to:<ITAG tagnum="15">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">401 M Street, SW.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Washington, DC 20460</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Attn: __________</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Sample Letter to Transmit CERCLA section 104(c)(9) Capacity AssurancePlan</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Dear Administrator:Section 104(c)(9) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Comprehensive,and Liability Act (CERCLA) requires States to assure you that they havesufficient hazardous waste treatment and disposal capacity to take careof all wastes expected to be generated within their borders for the nexttwenty years.On the basis of the Capacity Assurance Plan that I am providing you today,I can assure you that my administration has in place a comprehensive hazardouswaste management system.

It requiresa strong technical knowledge of your state's hazardous waste managementand tracking information systems, including data needed to meet federalreporting requirements. The key items to be reported are as follows:andbullet; The type and quantity of federally regulated (under RCRA) hazardouswaste generated within the state from both continuous industrial processesas well as one-time events, such as ``batch'' cleanups and RCRA and CERCLAcorrective actions.andbullet; The type and quantity of federally regulated hazardous waste shippedout-of-state.andbullet; The type and quantity of federally regulated hazardous waste receivedfrom other states.andbullet; The type and quantity of in-state capacity to manage RCRA-regulatedhazardous waste and other waste not regulated by the EPA that consumesthe state's hazardous waste management capacity, including state-regulatedwaste and non-hazardous waste.Much of the information developed in this chapter will serve as a baselinefor projecting future waste generation and disposal patterns. For example,information developed on the unused capacity available at in-state facilitieswill be useful when assessing future capacity needs. Similarly, currentpatterns of waste imports and exports can be used to project future behavior.General InstructionsThis chapter provides guidance to states on their responsibilities forreporting information on current waste generation, handling, and disposition.Personnel completing this chapter should consult the separate <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> for more detailed instructions on sourcesof data, data manipulation, and translation of raw data into the reportingformats provided in this chapter.The following worksheets must be completed to fulfill the minimum requirementsof Part I of the CAP:andbullet; Worksheet III-1 summarizing in-state generation of 17 types ofRCRA-hazardous waste.andbullet; Worksheet III-2 summarizing in-state waste management capacity.andbullet; Worksheets III-3, III-4, III-5, and III-6 reporting the demandsimposed by each of the 17 types of hazardous waste on each of the 15 wastemanagement categories (as applicable) in total and for on-site, off-sitecaptive, and commercial facilities.andbullet; Worksheet III-7 providing detail on waste exports.andbullet; Worksheet III-8 providing detail on waste imports.States may develop their own report forms (computer-driven reports aresatisfactory) but they must follow the general formats of the worksheetslisted above. Other worksheets and interim results may be included in theCAP at the discretion of the state unless otherwise noted.Only RCRA-regulated wastes are to be reported in the Worksheets. If a statecompiles figures for state-regulated waste, they should not be reportedin the Worksheets submitted as part of the state CAP. Similarly, althougha state may wish to track such quantities separately, the waste generatedby small quantity generators (less than 1000 kilograms of waste per month)should not be entered into the Worksheets to be submitted in a state'sCAP.The individual or individuals responsible for completing this chapter shouldbe thoroughly familiar with both state and federal hazardous waste reportingsystems. In almost all states, these individuals will be part of the state'sRCRA program office. However, staff from the state's Superfund office orthe equivalent EPA regional Superfund Office must be consulted to obtaininformation concerning site cleanups.Technical assistance is available from EPA in several forms. A hotlineat the Agency is available during the hours of XX and XX Eastern StandardTime, Monday through Friday. In addition, the EPA regional office servingyour state has assigned several individuals to answer questions; namesand addresses are provided in the <T3>Technical Reference Manual. </T3>EPA has provided direct technicalassistance through regional efforts to coordinate compliance with SARAsection 104(k). If states are unaware of these on-going initiatives, theyshould contact the RCRA coordinators in their regional offices for additionalinformation.Technical Reference ManualThe <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> that accompanies this guidance is designedto help extract and manipulate raw data from Biennial Reports and similarstate sources and produce reports for inclusion in a state's CAP. It providesfour sets of instructions, one of which will be applicable to your state,based on whether your state computerizes the Biennial Report of the equivalentdata and whether your state uses the old or new Biennial report forms (orequivalent data).Evaluation CriteriaThe Agency plans to judge this document primarily on the accuracy of thedata and supporting material used to complete the worksheets. In most cases_unlessotherwise noted by the state_EPA expects the waste generation data containedin the worksheets to correspond with information obtained by EPA throughits major reporting system, the Biennial Report. The Agency recognizesthat differences will exist, however, between the state and federal reportingsystems. States showing wide disparity between the amount of waste reportedfor the CAP and that reported to meet other federal requirements may beasked for more details.EPA plans to provide individualized state reports with detail on hazardouswaste management capacity in that state as reported in the agency's recent<T3>Treatment, Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Survey</T3> (TSDR). Thiswill allow states to report consistent and relatively accurate baselineinformation on waste management capacity. Recognizing that some informationfrom the TSDR survey may be up to three years obsolete at the time of thefirst CAP, states are encouraged to check these data and augment or correctthem before presenting them in the CAP. Any corrections should be documentedwith a simple narrative discussion of changes.Reporting Waste GenerationMost states now report the generation of hazardous waste by EPA waste code.More than 700 waste streams comprise EPA's list of regulated industrialresiduals. Two states_California and Washington_report waste flows usinga more aggregated set of waste codes developed at the University of California,Davis (these comprise the so-called UCD codes). For purposes of capacityassurance, all waste streams are to be grouped into 17 SARA waste types,which provide sufficient information for assignment to management methods.Tables XX, XX, and XX of the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> provide conversion factors to aggregatethe EPA and UCD waste codes into this new waste type system. These tablesmatch waste streams in either the EPA or UCD categories to the capacityassurance waste streams on the basis of waste phase (liquid, sludge, orsolid) and major constituent (organic components, metals, haolgenated compounds).Several miscellaneous categories convert directly.States using the new 1987 Biennial Report forms should use the appropriatetables and procedures described in the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> to transfer EPA waste codes into their17-waste type equivalent. This method uses the data on waste stream characteristicsin conjunction with the designated EPA waste code to create a relativelyprecise mapping procedure.States using the old Biennial Report forms should use a different set oftables and procedures presented in the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> to convert EPA waste codes into the17 SARA waste types. These conversions are generally considered less precisebecause less is known about waste stream characteristics. Where necessary,the procedures use a national profile of waste characteristics to facilitatethe conversion.Table XX of the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> maps UCD waste codes into the capacityassurance waste streams based on waste phase and major constituent.<ITAG tagnum="81">Waste Streams To Be Reported</ITAG>States should report only RCRA-regulated waste in the worksheets that presentwaste generation. States need not report the following when describingwaste generation: waste volumes that are regulated only by state law; wastesgenerated and handled through exempt onsite NPDES processes; exempt onsitein-process recycling (closed loop); exempt onsite treatment and dischargeto municipal treatment works; direct discharge to publicly owned treatmentworks without treatment; and exempt onsite recycling through stills. Forplanning purposes, states may wish to account for these or other typesof regulated waste, but they should include such wastes in separate formsfrom those used to report RCRA-only regulated waste.<ITAG tagnum="81">Sources of Data To Report Waste Generation</ITAG>For purposes of the 1989 assurance, all states should use the 1987 BiennialReport or the equivalent data elements collected in state reports to estimate1987 calendar year generation of these 17 waste types. While availabilitywill vary from state-to-state, equivalent sources of data include statesurveys of generators, waste management facility inventories, state-modifiedbiennial report forms, or waste manifest reports.<ITAG tagnum="81">Establishing A Base Year</ITAG>The EPA requests that states use 1987 as the base year to report wastegeneration. However, if a state has more accurate data for 1985 or 1986and feels that these data more precisely represent waste generation intheir state (because, for example, the state spent considerable resourcesto collect and analyze that data), they should present these figures andidentify the alternate base year. States that choose an alternate baseyear need not estimate waste generation in 1987.<ITAG tagnum="81">Units to Report Waste Generation</ITAG>All waste quantities should be reported in tons per year. Waste expressedin volumetric terms, such as gallons, should be multiplied by the densityof the waste in question (tons per gallon, for example) to yield the mostaccurate conversion into tons. Those states using the new Biennial Reportforms will find density information for each waste stream in form GM ofPackage B, Section III, Question D. In the absence of exact density characteristics,states may use the information presented in the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> (Table XX, based on the density ofwater) to convert from volume into tons. Table XX also provides severalcommon mass-to-mass conversion factors.Instructions for All WorksheetsA prototype state hazardous waste generation and handling system is depictedin Figure III-1. States should quantify the waste flows, for each of the17 capacity assurance waste types, for each of the boxes presented in FigureIII-1. Waste quantities should be reported in the worksheets noted belowthe boxes on the figure. On-site handling, for example, should be reportedin Worksheet III-4; all exports should be summarized in Worksheet III-7.Each worksheet is introduced in a general sense in this chapter. The <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> describes procedures to complete eachworksheet from raw data.The <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> is divided into four sections, basedon whether a state computerizes Biennial Report data or not and whethera state is using the old or new Biennial Report forms for the 1987 reportingcycle. States with computerized processing of new Biennial Report datashould consult Chapter 1 of the <T3>Technical Reference Manual.</T3> These states will be directed to ensurethat their Biennial Report data are arranged in a standard format, consistentwith the specifications of the Biennial Report Data System. Once so arranged,these states can access EPA-provided software that automatically generatesall of the required worksheets in their proper formats. Because of therichness of the data collected under the new reporting system, EPA's capacityassurance software will enable states to complete many optional analyses(consult the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> for details).States with computerized old Biennial Report data should consult Chapter2 of the <T3>Technical Reference Manual.</T3> They will be directed to follow asimilar computer-driven procedure to complete the Worksheets III-1 throughIII-8. Because the data are generally more limited in the old BiennialReporting system, fewer optional analyses will be available.States with manual processing of new Biennial Report data should consultChapter 3 of the <T3>Technical Reference Manual.</T3> Simplified procedures will be presentedto work directly from the Biennial Report forms themselves. These statesface perhaps the most time consuming task in completing the current generationand handling worksheets.States that process old Biennial Report data manually should consult Chapter4 of the <T3>Technical Reference Manual. </T3>A similar set of simplified procedureswill help states make the linkage between raw data and the completed worksheets.States for which Biennial Report data collection and processing is handledby the appropriate EPA regional office should contact the regional EPABiennial Report coordinator to determine the applicable set of instructionsto follow.For each of the four sets of the instructions, the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> describes methods to ensure that allstates (except as noted below) are able to complete the following typesof data manipulations:andbullet; Translating Biennial Report waste codes into 17 waste types;andbullet; Translating UCD waste codes into 17 waste types;andbullet; Translating TSDR Survey and Biennial Report waste management codesto 15 management categories;andbullet; Matching SARA waste types to SARA management categories basedeither on a national profile or new Biennial Report data;andbullet; Separating one-time waste generation from recurrent generationbased on new Biennial Report data;andbullet; Presenting both old and new Biennial Report data in the formatsspecified in Worksheets III-1 through III-8;andbullet; Sorting of exported waste by waste type;andbullet; Sorting of exported waste by management category;andbullet; Summarizing imported waste by state of origin and management category;andandbullet; Summarizing exported waste quantities by type of waste and statereceiving waste.In addition to these manipulations, the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> provides flow diagrams describing thelogic used to abstract data from both the old and new Biennial Reportsand report waste quantities as (1) generated and managed onsite, (2) generatedonsite and managed offsite, or (3) imported for management in state.Instructions for Worksheet III-1Worksheet III-1 asks states to summarize total in-state generation of RCRA-regulatedwaste. Total generation is comprised of primary generation (waste by-productsof manufacturing processes) and secondary generation (waste by-productsof waste treatment processes). While states need not draw this distinctionin the worksheet, states accessing EPA's capacity assurance software willbe able to generate a separate worksheet for each component.Worksheet III-1 also asks states to separate total generation into recurrentand one-time waste quantities. Recurrent wastes include both primary andsecondary streams attributable to on-going industrial activity. One-timewastes include those that result from isolated events such as equipmentcleaning or decommissioning, site cleanup, or off-spec product disposal.Only states using the new Biennial Report forms will be able to separaterecurrent from one-time waste generation. States using the old BiennialReport forms, which do not directly support such an analysis, should estimateone-time generation to the best of their ability, following directly supportsuch an analysis, should estimate one-time generation to the best of theirability, following instructions in the <T3>Technical Reference Manual.</T3> The <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> presents both computerized and manualprocedures to assist in this separation.Instructions for Worksheet III-2Worksheet III-2 asks states to summarize the waste handling capacity currentlyavailable in their state. EPA will supply all the necessary figures tocomplete this worksheet for the 1989 CAP. Because the basis for EPA's data,however, are the results of the 1986 National TSDR Survey, some capacityfigures may be obsolete. It is the state's responsibility to determinewhether data supplied by EPA are appropriate for use in the CAP. Therefore,states should use their own capacity figures if they represent a more completeassessment of capacity than the EPA data. States should briefly explainin footnotes to the appropriate worksheets any differences between morerecent capacity data and those supplied by EPA.In subsequent years, states will be responsible for collecting all capacitydata as part of their normal biennial reporting requirements.Instructions for Worksheets IIIandCx.3;3 Through III-6Together, Worksheets III-3 through III-6 constitute the core data describinga state's current hazardous waste management system. In these four worksheets,states are asked to link waste generation to demand for in-state wastemanagement capacity. Waste exports and the effect of waste imports alsomust be shown, and four types of management capacity must be examined:total in-state; in-state, on-site; in-state, captive; and in-state commercial.Completing these worksheets requires numerous data transactions; statesshould consult the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> for detailed instructions on theircompletion.For convenience, Worksheets III-3 through III-6 also present a separatecapacity block to display current and planned future capacity figures.For the 1989 CAP, all capacity data will be supplied by the EPA in individualstate reports. Thereafter, states will be expected to collect these dataas part of the normal biennial reporting process.The ``exports'' column on these worksheets summarizes waste residuals generatedas a by-product of waste management processes and exported for furthermanagement at out-of-state facilities.Instructions for Worksheets III-7 and III-8Worksheets III-7 and III-8 ask states to provide additional detail on theirwaste exports and imports, respectively. Both old and new Biennial Reportssupport the presentation of exported waste quantities by waste type andreceiving state. Similarly, both reports support the presentation of wasteimport quantities by waste type and state of origin. All states shouldconsult the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> for details on procedures to completethese worksheets.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 3 682</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Worksheet </T4>III-1._<T4>Summary of In-State Generation of Waste Streams in 1987 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Thousands of tons/year]</ITAG><H1>Waste Types</H1><H1>One-Time Generation</H1><H1>Recurrent Generation</H1><H1>Total Generation</H1><ITAG tagnum="1"> 1.

(For the CAP definitionof waste minimization see the Definitions Section at the end of the Chapter.)While the Agency believes a waste minimization program is a key step towardsound hazardous waste management, EPA recognizes that some states may chooseto assure adequate capacity without claiming waste reduction benefits.These states must supply only brief information on their ongoing or plannedwaste minimization efforts. Such information will be evaluated for completenessonly; EPA will not evaluate the waste minimization programs of these states.States that plan to use waste minimization to help them assure the availabilityof adequate management capacity must supply documentation on their ongoingand planned efforts. These states must describe the overall strategy oftheir programs, how they plan to account for waste minimization in theirwaste generation projections, and how these programs might affect wastegeneration for the projection years.General Instructions To complete the requirements of this chapter, states should respond tothe questions contained in the attached forms. States should copy and completethe appropriate forms and include them_along with additional documentation_intheir CAP. Not all forms must be completed. States not using waste minimization programs to reduce capacity demandmust complete the following form: <T3>Form I: Legislative Authority. </T3>This form requests informationon the present legislative authority for a waste minimization program,its general make up, funding, staffing, and any anticipated legislativeor programmatic changes. States that anticipate using waste minimization programs to reduce capacitydemand must complete Form I and the following forms: <T3>Form II: Waste Minimization Reduction Estimates. </T3>This form requestsdetailed information on the state's anticipated effect of state and industrialwaste minimization efforts, technical basis of these estimates, and measuresof effectiveness. <T3>Form III: Program Components Descriptions. </T3>This form requestsmore detailed information on the individual components that comprise thestate's waste minimization program. The information requests in Forms II and III will enable the EPA to assessthe reasonableness of the state's proposed goals and activities and tomonitor the progress of the state's programs. A glossary of the terms used to describe the waste minimization programcomponents is contained in the Definitions Section at the end of the chapter.In addition, technical assistance is available from EPA in several forms.A Hotline at the Agency is available during the hours of XX and XX EasternStandard Time, Monday through Friday. In addition, the EPA Regional Officeserving your state has assigned several individuals to answer questions.Please consult the <T3>Technical Reference Manual </T3>for more details, including a listof individuals and phone numbers.Evaluation Criteria EPA plans to evaluate each state's waste minimization plan differently.For states not choosing to incorporate any waste minimization estimatesinto projections of capacity need, the Agency will simply review the state'ssubmittal for accuracy and completeness. In these cases, the Agency willmake no judgment on the adequacy of the particular waste minimization programoperated by the state, if any such program is operating or planned. For states that rely on waste minimization to reduce the demand for wastetreatment capacity, the Agency must conduct a more detailed evaluation.For these states, the following must be demonstrated in the CAP. andbullet; The estimated reduction in waste are based on a sound technicalevaluation of the potential effects of waste minimization in your state.This does not require a technical analysis of waste minimization potentialbut an examination from available information to determine how it may applyto your state. andbullet; The resources committed to implementing the waste minimizationstrategy are consistent with the plan set forth by the states; and, andbullet; The activities for projected accomplishments in waste minimizationare reasonable and there is a plan to implement these activities.<ITAG tagnum="71">Form I: Legislative Authority</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All states must fill out this form.

Source reduction measures include processmodifications, feedstock substitutions, improvements in feedstock purity,housekeeping and management practices, increases in the efficiency of machinery,and recycling within a process. Source reduction implies any action thatreduces the amount of waste exiting from a process.<T3>Recycling.</T3> The use or reuse of a waste as an effective substitutefor a commercial product, or as an ingredient or feedstock in an industrialprocess. It also refers to the reclamation of useful constituent fractionswithin a waste material or removal of contaminants from a waste to allowit to be reused. As used in this report, recycling implies use, reuse,or reclamation of a waste either on site or off site after it is generatedby a particular process.<ITAG tagnum="81">Characterization of Waste Minimization Terms</ITAG>Technical Assistance<T3>On-Site Assistance.</T3> Comprehensive technical assistance to aidindustry in reducing the volume or toxicity of wastes generated. May includeconsultation on industrial and waste management practices and waste minimizationoptions.<T3>Information Clearinghouse/Library. </T3>A data base (electronic orhardcopy) made available to managers involved in waste minimization. Clearinghousesprovide access to documents, references, and telephone assistance.<T3>Technical Workshops. </T3>Information dissemination programs designedto keep industry and the community up-to-date on programs, technology,waste minimization activities and appropriate regulatory information.<T3>Feasibility Studies. </T3>Technical assistance, provided off-site,consisting of process analysis and engineering study utilizing generalknowledge. May be based on information gathered from similar industriesor previous on-site technical assistance. Project results are usually applicableto assist in solving select ranges of manufacturing or institutional problems.Economic Incentives<T3>Awards/Matching Grants. </T3>Direct payments from the state to hazardouswaste generators or others engaged in waste minimization activities. Maybe structured to encourage various types of waste minimization activities,to assist specific types of firms, or to focus on particular waste streams.<T3>Taxes/Fees.</T3> A means by which states create an economic incentivefor waste minimization. Front-end taxes can be imposed at or near the beginningof the commercial chain of production, throughout the distribution network,and at the point of consumption of selected chemicals and substances. Waste-endtaxes may be levied on the generation, transportation, storage, treatment,or disposal of wastes.<T3>Low-Interest Loans.</T3> Financial assistance that enables firms toreduce the cost of financing investments in processes and technologiesthat reduce wastes. Usually directed to both small and mid-sized hazardouswaste generators who may be unable to obtain commercial credit at an affordableprice.<T3>Tax Credits.</T3> A direct reduction in the tax liability of the firm,generally rewarding only capital investments.Waste ExchangesWaste generated by one company are provided or sold to another companythat can use the waste material in their operation. Recipient companiesusually use the waste untreated or subject it to a minimal amount of treatmentprior to reuse.Research and DevelopmentInvolves applied hazardous waste research, development, and demonstrationprojects and may include feasibility studies, pilot- and bench-scale demonstrationprojects, and economic and policy analyses. Usually funded by governmentand in some cases the private sector, these projects are typically undertakenby universities and other academic institutions.Regulatory Requirements<T3>Reporting Requirements.</T3> Requests by the government for generatorinformation sufficient to determine the effectiveness of waste minimizationprograms. In some cases the companies involved in waste minimization arerequired to submit their plan as a part of a permit application to theregulating authority for adequacy.<T3>Reduction Standards.</T3> Specific targets for reduction over timein the quantity and/or toxicity of certain waste streams.<T3>Design or Operating Standards.</T3> Limitations or criteria appliedto process design and manufacturing operations, usually specific to particularindustries and/or waste streams, to minimize waste generation.<T3>Management Standards. </T3>Directed to encourage waste minimization.Requires good management practice standards which may include mandatoryaudits or listing of wastes on a waste exchange.Education<T3>Governor's or Other Award Programs. </T3>A low-cost means to recognizeand honor companies and institutions that have demonstrated outstandingachievement in hazardous waste management.<T3>Public Education/Outreach. </T3>Promotional activities designed tokeep the public informed of the need for a commitment to hazardous wasteminimization.

The resultis an estimate of projected capacity needs for each waste management category.The completed worksheets and narrative should represent Part 3 of the CAP.States must project waste generated within their borders in 1989, 1995,and 2009. The 1989 projection year corresponds to the next biennial reportingyear. The 1995 projection will present a near-term estimate of demandsfor waste management after most of the current hazardous waste regulations_theland disposal restrictions in particular_take effect. The law specifiesthat states assure adequate waste management capacity for 20 years, hencethe year 2009 projection.The methods contained in this chapter reflect procedures commonly usedtoday to project waste generation. The Agency recognizes the inherent uncertaintyof projections and the limitations of all procedures. For this reason,the Agency does not endorse any one system; states are free to choose theapproach that best represents their particular situation. However, allprojections must adhere to the following general guidelines:andbullet; Projections must take into account economic expansion or contractionand its effect on the quantity of waste generated by the major sourceswithin the state.andbullet; Projections must account for the effects of waste minimizationactivities on future waste generation, based on clear documentation asdescribed in Chapter IV and quantified in this chapter.andbullet; Projections must account for non-recurrent wastes (from equipmentdecommissioning or replacement, materials or product disposal, materialsor product spills, closure actions, remedial or corrective actions, orother non-routine sources) as well as waste generated from continuous industrialprocesses.andbullet; To the extent possible, the state must address the potential effectof regulatory change on future waste generation and management options.EPA will provide a list of key regulations that the states should includein their analysis.General InstructionsFor each of the projection years, states should summarize their projectionsof waste quantities and effects on waste management capacity using worksheetsV-1 and V-2, respectively. Worksheet V-2 is used to calculate waste managementdemand from in-state waste after subtracting waste exports. Worksheet V-3is similar to Worksheet V-2, except that it requires states to estimatemanagement capacity demand based on total in-state waste generation (includingprojected exports). Final potential capacity needs are determined in WorksheetV-4, which asks states to report estimated capacity needs after incorporatingthe effect of waste imports and exports. While the combined effect of importsand exports are used to estimate capacity needs, states also must reportthe balance of total in-state generated waste (including potential exports)against total in-state available capacity (excluding potential exports).This calculation, also required in Worksheet V-4, will be used by EPA toexamine the effect of waste imports and exports on each state's capacitybalance.The following sections provide general instructions on projecting wastefrom continuous industrial processes using common economic indicators andprocedures; and projecting waste generated intermittently, such as thatresulting from RCRA and CERCLA cleanups. Much of the analysis conductedfor Chapter III will be used to complete this chapter, and similar expertisewill be needed. In addition, states should coordinate their efforts withother state offices responsible for projecting and/or tracking state industrialactivity or revenues. To the extent possible, waste generation should bebased on the same economic forecast information used to project generalbusiness activity in the state or region.Technical assistance is available from EPA in several forms. A Hotlineat the Agency is available during the hours of XX and XX Eastern StandardTime, Monday through Friday. In addition, the EPA Regional Office servingyour state has assigned several individuals to answer questions. Pleaseconsult the <T3>Technical Reference Manual</T3> for more details, including a listof individuals and phone numbers.Evaluation criteriaThe Agency recognizes that no single methodology exists that is universallyacceptable for projecting hazardous waste generation. Considerable discretionis left to the states to formulate reasonable projection methods. However,the Agency plans to evaluate the waste projections portion of the state'sCAP on the following points:andbullet; The underlying economic assumptions used in the projections shouldreflect existing or official projections of state economic activity unlessotherwise justified by the state;andbullet; The projections must account for major waste producing industriesand the range of possible changes in the economic behavior of these industries;andbullet; The projections must account for non-recurrent waste (e.g., CERCLAor RCRA remedial or corrective actions);andbullet; The projections must correctly incorporate the predicted effectsof waste minimization as outlined in Chapter IV; andandbullet; The projections must document assumptions regarding waste importsand exports as required in the CAP.Many states will have the capabilities to provide detailed estimates offuture waste generation amounts and their demand for management capacity.Others may not have these capabilities or may choose not to make detailedestimates either because they have limited industrial sources or do notforesee significant economic changes taking place. EPA will accept allprojections as long as they show that the state has considered all relevantfactors and is not in conflict with other official state policy on economicdevelopment.EPA recognizes that projections made for year 20 will be far less certainthan those made over the short term. In the absence of additional information,the EPA will accept linear extrapolation of trends developed through the1995 projection period.Projecting Recurrent Waste Generation From Industrial SourcesUsing 1987 generation as a baseline, states should first estimate expectedgeneration for projection years 1989, 1995, and 2009 solely on the basisof economic changes. States should then make adjustments to these estimatesto account for the expected effects of waste minimization as describedin Chapter IV. Finally, states should, to the best of their ability, adjusttheir projections to account for the effects of pending regulations (listedsubsequently in this chapter) on the demand for waste management capacity.<ITAG tagnum="81">Projecting Waste Generation Based on Economic Expansion or Contraction</ITAG>Economic change is a combination of two measures: changes in economic base(reflected by the basic composition of the region's industry, includingnew entrants and closures) and changes in industrial output (defined asthe total value of goods and services from current industrial production).The agency does not expect states to forecast changes in their state'seconomic base, unless such changes are likely and critical_announced plantclosures or start-ups of key industries are examples of such critical changes.However, absent such information, states should assume that the set ofindustries responsible for generating the majority of the state's hazardouswaste in the base year will exist over the projection period.The states should account for the effects of economic forces specific toeach state and, ideally, to those industries currently responsible forthe majority of waste generated. This involves two steps. First, statesshould compile a list of those industries that are responsible for generatingthe majority of waste (as defined by the 17 CAP waste categories) in theirstate. For states using EPA's new Biennial Report forms, these data areavailable in Form IC, Section IV (SIC code identification) and either GMor GS (waste quantities).Second, the waste generation characteristics of these industries shouldbe normalized to some indicator of economic output (discussed subsequently).Projections of the same economic indicator (or growth factors) then canbe used to project waste from the industrial category in question. Forstates in which most of the 17 waste categories are dominated by a singleindustry or ones having similar growth potential, these growth factorssimply may be applied to each of the 17 waste categories as appropriate.Industries of Interest. Ideally, industrial activity should be forecastfor each 4-digit SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) code industryresponsible for one percent or more of a state's total waste volume. Thereare about 450 4-digit SIC industries represented in the Office of Managementand Budget's Standard Industrial Classification system. While the mix ofmajor waste generating industries will vary from state to state, most statesshould find that less than 100 4-digit SIC industries will account for95 percent to 99 percent of total state generation. In many states, particularlythe smaller ones, the majority of hazardous waste quantities will be attributableto perhaps 20 industry groups.Even though economic projections at the 4-digit SIC code level of detailmay provide the most accurate basis for projecting future waste quantitiesattributable to economic change, states are not required to build sophisticatedprojections models to track changes at this level. States should choosethe level of detail in their economic projections best suited to theirindustrial bases, level of detail in baseline waste generation data, andtechnical support available within the state to make projections. Somestates may find, for example, that projections at the 2-digit SIC codelevel are most appropriate. Others may not have access to SIC code informationlinked to waste generation and may thus choose to project economic changeusing a statewide growth index such as total state product. All of thesemethods will be acceptable to the Agency if they are appropriately documented.Factors for Projection. Actual records of the number of product units manufactured_tonsof steel or barrels of oil, for example_are the most certain measures ofindustrial output because they capture, by definition, actual manufacturingactivity within the plant. But using these measures to project future outputin 70 to 100 industries would be unnecessarily complex. In the past fewyears, states have chosen to project economic changes using the followingindicators, specific to a target group of 4-digit SIC industries:andbullet; Total employment;andbullet; Production employment;andbullet; Value added by manufacture;andbullet; Value of shipments; andandbullet; Personal income from manufacturing (wages).States should choose the indicator that most closely approximates in-plantindustrial activity, and for which adequate data is available. None ofthe indicators above are perfect in this respect but some are better thanothers. Availability of the data may be the overriding factor influencingthe state's decision.Value of shipments, for example, is routinely reported in national aggregatestatistics and at the individual plant level. But this measure does notdistinguish between manufacturing and inventories as the source of shipments.Waste generation would be overestimated, for example, if waste was normalizedto data that represented shipments from inventories instead of production,since actual production levels (and, hence, waste) in that year would belower than shipments would indicate. In addition, the double counting associatedwith cross-shipments in value of shipments data may account for overestimatesof plant activity.Total employment also is routinely reported in national statistics andby individual plants, but changes in employment can misrepresent manufacturingactivity if management and production employment change at different rates.In addition, waste generation estimates based on employment will be significantlyoverestimated if a company headquarters, representing largely managementas opposed to production labor, constitutes a significant share of totalemployment within a given SIC code.Value added closely parallels manufacturing activity because this measureavoids the problem of inventories associated with value of shipments data.These data are more limited, however, at the national level and they arerarely reported by individual manufacturing establishments.While production employment is an input measure of manufacturing and notan output measure, it remains a good overall indicator insofar as it parallelsmanufacturing activity and is generally available at the 4-digit SIC codelevel regionally. It is important to account for changes in labor productivity,however, in projections of waste generation as a function of productionemployment. As industries automate, the ratio of waste per production employeemay change, leading to over- or underestimates of future waste productionif these adjustments are overlooked. In general, as labor productivityincreases (the output per production employee rises), more waste will becreated per employee in future years than in the baseline year.Personal income from manufacturing, or simply wages, is another good overallindicator of plant activity. Estimates of personal income from manufacturingare available in national aggregate form, by 4-digit SIC code, and by state.Sources of Data. The U.S. Department of Commerce (Bureau of the Census)and the U.S. Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics) collect andpublish historical data on value of shipments, value added, total employment,production employment and income from manufacturing at the 4-digit SICcode level, by state or by county. At a minimum, all states can use thesedata to project future trends based on trends over the past five years.Alternatively, the Bureau of Industrial Economics prepares similar projectionsfor groups of 4-digit SIC industries for the nation as a whole in its annualpublication, <T3>U.S. Industrial Outlook.</T3> States can adapt these national projectionsif they so choose or they can adjust them with state-specific data. TheBureau of the Census' publication, <T3>County Business Patterns, </T3>provides a source of historical dataon employment and sales, by industry and by county. Projections of personalincome from manufacturing by SIC code and state through the year 2000 areavailable through the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similar projectionsat the state level may be available from state agencies responsible foremployment or labor trends.Typically, a state economic development office or office of the Governorresponsible for revenue projections will prepare its own forecast of industrygrowth. These projections may be incorporated directly into capacity assuranceprojections.Reporting Projections. States report the results of hazardous waste projectionsattributable to economic change in column A of Worksheet V-1. A separateWorksheet should be presented for each projection year.Documenting Projections. States should develop narrative support for theprojections of waste generation and demand for management types presentedin Worksheet V-1. In particular, the narrative documenting the effectsof economic change should explain how growth factors were applied to projectwaste.<ITAG tagnum="81">Incorporating the Effects of Waste Minimization</ITAG>States have the option to reduce demands for waste management capacityin 1989, 1995, and 2000 by promoting waste reduction and projecting itseffects. Plans for implementing and accounting for such activities mustbe documented in Chapter IV. In that chapter, states must identify twokey parameters of thier waste reduction adjustments: (1) target percentor tonnage reductions by waste type, and (2) a schedule over which thesereductions are expected to take place. In this chapter, states must showhow the factors developed in Chapter IV have been incorporated in theirprojections.The most straightforward approach is to adjust the expected waste quantitiesgenerated in a target year by the quantity expected to be reduced throughwaste reduction. A simple narrative explanation of how waste reductionfactors were applied should be included to support the adjustments madein column B of Worksheet V-1.<ITAG tagnum="81">Incorporating the Effects of Regulatory Changes on Waste Generation</ITAG>EPA anticipates that changes in regulations over the projection periodwill affect both waste quantities (the demand for waste management capacity)and the allowable alternatives for management. Both are expected to affecta state's ability to assure adequate capacity. This section identifiesthe extent to which states should include the effects of regulatory changeson projections of waste generation. A subsequent section addresses theeffects of regulatory changes on capacity supply and on the allowable matchingof waste type to management categories.The effects of regulatory changes on the demand side should be incorporatedin column C of Worksheet V-1. Regulatory effects on waste generation alsoshould be documented separately in a narrative statement.Because of the uncertainty in projecting these effects over a 20-year period,EPA expects the states to account for regulatory change only to the extentthat the Agency has published and can make available to the state its RegulatoryImpact Analysis (RIA) for each rule, as of October 1, 1988. The RIA willdescribe likely quantitative effects on waste generation and consequentdemands for management technologies. The following is a list of rules thatEPA expects to have an impact on capacity assurance, and for which publicationof an RIA is expected by October 1:Land Disposal Restrictions, First Third. Should effect virtually all listedand characteristic wastes and, by extension, all industries generatingthem. Expected to shift the management of certain waste streams away fromland disposal and toward incineration and other treatment options. Alsoexpected to stimulate waste reduction. Treatment standards must be promulgatedby May 8, 1990.New Listings. Should expand the number of waste streams under regulation;six new wood preserving waste streams will be proposed in September 1988,including two wastewater streams (1.1 million tons/year) and four processstreams (45,000 tons/year); two new waste streams to be added in summer1988 from methyl bromide manufacture (amounts confidential); one new wastestream from petroleum refining to be added in 1988 (200,000 tons/year).States should estimate the additions (or deletions) to regulated wastevolumes attributable to the above rules and record these results in ColumnC of Worksheet V-1.Projecting Non-Recurrent and One-Time Only Waste GenerationNon-recurrent waste generation can result from periodic industrial operations(boiler and other process unit maintenance) and RCRA and CERCLA correctiveactions and cleanups. Waste generated from these sources_while possiblysignificant_are much more difficult to project than waste from continuousindustrial processes. In the long run, the demand for capacity imposedby one-time wastes may be less important to capacity assurance than thedemand imposed by recurrent wastes. Separating one-time from recurrentwastes, therefore, should be in the state's best interest.EPA recognizes that data for projecting the generation of one-time wasteare generally less available and less reliable than data on recurrent wastegeneration. This section describes possible methods that states may useto make such projections, given current data inadequacies. States are encouragedto develop alternative methods to project one-time waste generation andto fully document their assumptions and procedures.While data may not always be available to support realistic calculations,states_as a minimum_should attempt to estimate RCRA-hazardous waste producedfrom the following classes of activities;andbullet; Site remedial actions (from federal Superfund and state clean-ups);andbullet; RCRA corrective actions;andbullet; Underground storage tank cleanup; andandbullet; Site remedication as a result of real estate transfer statutes.The projected sum of all non-recurrent waste quantities should be reportedby waste type in column D of Worksheet V-1 (one worksheet for each projectionyear). Calculations should be documented in a separate narrative.<ITAG tagnum="81">Notice of Corrective Actions to Receiving State</ITAG>To assist states in accounting for the amounts of CERCLA corrective actionwaste imported into their state, the EPA will inform the recipient stateregarding its intention to fund remedial actions and immediate removalsthat will cause wastes to be shipped to that state. This information willinclude the source of waste, waste quantity, waste characteristics, proposedtreatment or disposal facility to receive waste, and anticipated shipmentdate. The information will be provided to the recipient state's environmentalregulatory agency at least 45 days in advance of the anticipated shipmentdate. This action will allow the recipient state an opportunity to comenton the consistency of the removal with both the exporting state's CAP andits own plan.<ITAG tagnum="89">Site Remedial Actions</ITAG>For many Superfund sites, estimates of the quantities of contaminated sitewastes (soils and groundwater) that may require off-site treatment anddisposal are available in Records of Decision (RODS). Where RODS have notyet been prepared, more limited information regarding quantities likelyto be encountered at Superfund sites may be available in Remedial Investigations,Feasibility Studies, or Hazard Ranking System listings. These documentsare available for review in EPA's 10 regional offices. The annual volumeof wastes to be removed from these sites is largerly a function of theextent of contamination (and hence the decision to ship waste off-siteor handle it on-site) and rate of expenditures for site cleanup activities.EPA recognizes that these estimates will be highly uncertain, especiallyfor those sites without approved RODs or for state cleanup sites withoutcomparable documentation.Where data permit, states should prepare a list of all federal and stateSuperfund sites for which reliable estimates of the quantity to be handledis available and estimate a time interval over which actual remedial workwill be completed. Such estimates may be best made by the State Superfundoffice or the EPA regional Superfund coordinator. For each site, preparea listing of the contaminants that predominate and match them as closelyas possible to one (or more) of the 17 capacity assurance waste categories.Much of this information should be available in site investigation anddecision documents referenced above. In the absence of such information,exclude this site from further consideration.States should then estimate the quantity of Superfund waste expected tobe handled off-site at in-state facilities versus that quantity to be exported.Superfund waste shipped off-site must be manifested like any other wastestream regulated under RCRA. An analysis of current waste manifests maybe used to project future in-state handling from exported Superfund waste.Regardless of how states make this estimate, however, it should be fullydocumented with descriptions of procedures and explanations of assumptions.<ITAG tagnum="81">RCRA Corrective Action Sites</ITAG>State should assemble the following information:(1) From the regional EPA office or the state RCRA permitting office (dependingon your state's authorization), compile a list of potential RCRA sitesthat will require corrective action (be sure to include corrective actionas a condition of obtaining a Part B permit plus corrective action as acondition of closure). In most cases, states will be unable to estimatewaste quantities or waste volumes to be removed unless a Corrective MeasuresStudy (CMS) has been prepared. The Agency recognizes that as relativelyfew corrective action sites have progressed to the CMS stage (several yearsmay elapse before a potential site has been fully evaluated), states maybe limited in their ability to incorporate the effects of RCRA correctiveaction into their 1989 CAP. In the absence of these data, states may wishto assume that a proportion of RCRA facilities will require correctiveaction and document that assumption to the best of their ability.(2) Estimate the amounts and timing of expected on-site management demandsand off-site demands using methods described above for Superfund site estimates.(3) Estimate the proportion of off-site waste expected to be shipped toin-state facilities and that shipped out of state using information onwaste manifest forms. In the absence of an historical record of shipmentsfrom RCRA corrective action sites, the state should assume that all removedmaterial will be shipped to in-state facilities, if they now exist. Otherwiseassume that they will be exported.<ITAG tagnum="81">Underground Storage Tanks</ITAG>While they are regulated separately, corrective action requirements forreleases from tanks containing petroleum or hazardous substances are similarto other cleanup requirements_visibly contaminated soils must be removed.If residual contamination of groundwater or surrounding soils persists,additional cleanup is necessary. Actual levels of cleanup are determinedon the basis of site-specific environmental risks and potential exposure.States should include estimates of RCRA-hazardous waste quantities likelyto be generated as a result of underground storage tank remediation, onlyif sufficient data are available. The type of data needed include:andbullet; Inventory of tanks subject to regulationandbullet; Statistics on leakage rates, preferably by type of tank andbullet; Characterization of tank inventory by contents (gasoline, solvents,other organics, inorganics)andbullet; Field estimates of extent of contamination. If these data areavailable, states should estimate quantities and timing of demand for wastemanagement services using methods similar to those presented for estimatingSuperfund demands. <ITAG tagnum="81">Site Remediation From Real Estate Transaction Laws </ITAG>If applicable, states should include estimates of RCRA-regulated wastegenerated from site remediation pursuant to state real estate transferstatutes (i.e. New Jersey's ECRA statute) based on trends in past ratesof generation, if such data are available. <ITAG tagnum="81">Total Projected Demands</ITAG>States should record the sum of columns A through D in column E of WorksheetV-1. This quantity represents the total projected demand for waste managementcapacity without consideration for the location of handling or of the effectsof imports or exports. Matching Waste Types to Management Categories and Incorporating the Effectsof Regulatory Change on Capacity SupplyTotal demands for waste management capacity should be brought forward fromColumn E of Worksheet V-1 and distributed among the 15 waste managementcategories in Worksheet V-2 in such a way that none of the rules expectedto be in place in each projection year would be violated. Most untreatedliquid and sludges, for example, should be banned from land disposal by1995; thus, no waste of this nature should be matched with land disposalin Worksheet V-2, unless it first undergoes some treatment. States shouldbriefly describe the assumptions behind their projected matches of wastetypes to management categories. States also should estimate the demand for RCRA, capacity imposed by non-regulatedwaste. EPA will provide estimates of these data as of 1986 from the TSDRSurvey. States can hold this level of demand steady over the projectionperiod or adjust it up or down, consistent with state policies on the properhandling of non RCRA-regulated waste. These entries should be documentedin a separate narrative. Projecting Efforts. States may show level, reduced, or increassed exports(relative to 1987 levels) in the final column of Worksheet V-2, to theextent that they do not violate the ``reasonableness'' criteria of AppendixA. EPA will assume that the pattern of exports (the states to which differentquantities of exports are sent) in the projection years will remain thesame as the pattern of exports in 1987 as noted in Worksheet III-7. Ifa state believes that this pattern will change in any projection year,a narrative statement should accompany worksheet V-2, explaining the changes.For example, a state might enter into an agreement with another state thatchanges the pattern of export flows to that state, as reflected in bothstates' CAPs. Worksheet V-3 is similar to V-2, except that it asks states to determinethe effect on management capacity of all projected in-state waste, includingexports. The results of both Worksheets will be used to estimate capacityneed in Worksheet V-4. Calculating Hazardous Waste Management Capacity Needs Using Worksheet V-4, states must determine the amount of management capacitypotentially needed in the state over the next 20 years. In determiningthese needs, the state must make adjustments to account for on-site andcaptive handling and describe assumptions on waste imports and exports.<ITAG tagnum="81">Adjustments for On-Site and Captive Handling </ITAG>For purposes of assuring capacity, states can assume that all-waste (orthe proportion of total waste) currently managed on-site will continueto be managed on-site, unless the state believes regulatory changes ormarket forces will alter this pattern. If such shifts are anticipated,states should document the assumptions leading to the conclusion. Similarly,states can assume that all waste (for the proportion of total waste) nowhandled in captive facilities will be handled in captive facilities inthe projection years. In either case, states should retrieve the appropriate data from ChapterIII, Worksheets III-3 and III-4 and present their best estimate of on-siteand captive handling in Worksheet V-4 (a separate worksheet for each projectionyear). The first row of Worksheet V-4 should be brought forward from thecolumn totals of Worksheet V-2 and V-3.<ITAG tagnum="81">Projecting Commercial Capacity Needs </ITAG>States should calculate their potential need for additional in-state wastemanagement capacity using the top block of rows in Worksheet V-4. Thesecalculations use the demand projection figures obtained from WorksheetV-2, which subtract the quantities of waste projected to be exported bythe state (see ``Projecting Exports,'' page V-7). To calculate ``TotalDemand With Imports, Excluding Exports,'' total demand estimates firstmust be transferred from the last row of Worksheet V-2 (for each appropriateprojection year). Capacity demand directed to on-site and captive facilitiesnext must be subtracted (see discussion above), and demand due to projectedwaste imports must be added. Projecting Waste Import Demand. States may hold imports constant to 1987levels_or allow them to grow_in their demand projections without providingadditional narrative to EPA. If imports are shown to decline. The assumptionof declining imports would be acceptable if it corresponds with CAP ofthe state exporting the waste, or if it is based on the importing state'sassumption that export practices from other states will change over timein accordance with the process of Appendix A. If an assumption of decliningimports is not supported by other states' CAPs, then the importing statemust fully document the basis of its assumption. Final Calculation of Demand. In estimating final demand, states may claimall available capacity projected as available through 1989, based on theiranalysis in Chapter III. Data on 1989 commercial capacity should be obtainedfrom Worksheet III-6. The predicted 1989 commercial capacity should besubtracted from the total commercial demand figures in Worksheet V-4 toobtain an estimate of capacity shortfall (or excess) in each projectionyear. These figures will form the basis of capacity need plans as describedin Chapter VI. Calculating the In-State Capacity Balance. The bottom block of rows inWorksheet V-4 are used to calculate the balance of total in-state commercialcapacity (excluding import demand) against total in-state waste generation(including potential waste exports.) To complete these calculations, statesfirst should transfer the demand estimates from Worksheet V-3 (for eachappropriate year) to Worksheet V-4 (for each appropriate year). Subsequentcalculations then are similar to those described above (for the top blockof rows) except that import effects are neglected. The result of these calculations will be used by EPA to assess the effectof waste imports and exports on the commercial capacity contained in eachstate. They will not be used as a basis for assessing future need. Plans To Address Capacity ShortfallsStates that show an excess of management capacity in Worksheet V-4 forthe projection years 1989, 1995, and 2009 are not required to present plansfor addressing capacity shortfalls. These states must only supply briefinformation in Chapter VI. States that show a shortfall of management capacity in Worksheet V-4 forprojection years 1989, 1995, and 2009 must describe their procedures inChapter VI to create new capacity through either new or expanded facilitiesin the state. States may choose not to meet the entire shortfall by creatingnew capacity. In this case they must revise their numbers for waste minimization(Chapter IV) and waste exports and recalculate Worksheet V-4. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Worksheet </T4>V-1._<T4>Summary of In-State Waste Quantities Produced in Projection Year __</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[All in tons/year]</ITAG><H1>Management Technology</H1><H1>Projected Demand From Recurrent Waste Generation</H1><H1>Adjustment for Waste Reduction</H1><H1>Adjustment for Regulatory Change</H1><H1>Demand from One-Time Waste</H1><H1>Total Demand (A+B+C+D)</H1><ITAG tagnum="25"> <D>A</D><D>B</D><D>C</D><D>D</D><D>E </D><R/></ITAG> 1.

Becausethe CAP addresses a 20-year timeframe, most states will not have adequatecapacity in-place today to handle all the hazardous waste generated overthe next 20 years, making it necessary for States to document their proceduresto allow or facilitate capacity development.Chapter V of the guidance document asked each state to summarize theirprojected need for hazardous waste management capacity over the next twentyyears, after taking into account waste minimization efforts and waste exports.All states showing a shortfall in their hazardous waste management capacityin their projection years must describe their plans for addressing thisshortfall through their facility siting process and their procedures toprocess existing facility expansion applications. States projecting hazardouswaste capacity shortfallls within the projection period through 1995 alsomust report key interim and final siting milestones, such as site designation,permit submission, permit approval, and expected construction start.General Instructions To complete the requirements of this chapter, states should respond tothe questions contained in the attached forms. States should copy and completethe appropriate forms and include them in the CAP. Additional documentationshould be included as needed.Not all forms must be completed. States that project sufficient capacitythrough year 20 must only complete Form I, ``General Siting Description''.This form requests general information on state procedures that affector facilitate the development of new hazardous waste capacity. It coverssuch items as the state's general siting process, preemption and overrideauthority of local and state government, and laws that restrict the operationor configuration of a facility.States that project a capacity shortfall in any projection year after takinginto account waste minimization and waste exports must complete both FormI and Form II, ``Capacity Development Plans,'' requests a more detaileddescription of topics covered under Form I.Finally, those states that project a shortfall in 1989 or 1995 must completeall forms up through Form III, ``Milestones and State Review''. This formrequests information on the state's anticipated progress in meeting itsshortfall.A glossary of the terms used in this Chapter is contained in the DefinitionSection at the end of the chapter.

Please consult the <T3>Technical Reference Manual </T3>for more details, including a listof individuals and phone numbers.Evaluation CriteriaThe EPA recognizes that many different state approaches exist for planningand overseeing the development of new hazardous waste management capacity.Each state has and probably will employ a different strategy to ensurethat it has adequate capacity now and in the future. The Agency thereforewill focus its evaluation on two key areas:andbullet; The ability of a state program to allow or facilitate the developmentof adequate capacity when needed; and,andbullet; The degree of a state's reliance on out-of-state capacity as asubstitute for developing in-state capacity.If a state has shown in Chapter V that it plans to construct new capacityto meet projected needs, EPA will evaluate the ability of a state programto meet the expected shortfall. Because the Agency recognizes that statescan do many things to promote, facilitate, or simply allow the developmentof new capacity, the Agency will concentrate in review on items that mayindicated a flawed program or that actually hinder siting. Practices orpolicies that may either hinder new capacity development or indicate programdifficulties include the following:andbullet; A state siting processs that is subject to strong local premptionpowers not firmly grounded in environmental, health, and safety concerns.An inability of the state to appeal or rectify such preemption.andbullet; The absence of a siting program having clearly defined steps andprocedures. A lack of sufficient opportunity for public review and comment.The absence of clear time lines between permit review, comments, and approvalor denial.andbullet; The enactment of rules that may be viewed as discriminatory, suchas placing limits on facility size, type of waste allowed at the facilitybased on origin of the waste, or outright prohibition of waste managementfacilities if not based on environmental health, and safety concerns. (Thiswould not include limitations that may be agreed to by the facility developerand the host community as part of siting process negotiation.)andbullet; A state having sufficient demand for new hazardous waste capacityaccompanied by a history of failed siting efforts.The Agency also will examine the states reliance on out-of-state hazardouswaste management capacity to determine if it conflicts with the requirementsset forth in Appendix A.<ITAG tagnum="71">Form I: General Siting Description</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All states must fill out this form.

This encompasses all elements of screening andevaluation involved in gaining approval for a specific hazardous wastefacility at a specific site. The process includes site selection (whenrequired), application for the various required state, national, and localpermits, review of those applications by the appropriate government agenciesin accordance with criteria previously specified, hearings, other formsof public involvement where applicable (local advisory committees, negotiation),submission and review of application amendments and revisions and finaldecision (approval or denial of the application).<T3>Siting Criteria</T3>. These are constraints and guidelines specifiedby each state for evaluating the suitability of individual sites proposedfor hazardous waste management facilities. These criteria can include outrightprohibitions against siting facilities in certain environments (in 100year flood plains) or can be more general and list the variables that shouldbe taken into consideration in evaluating proposed sites (population densityand evacuation plans).<T3>Milestone</T3>. This is a task or achievement to be accomplished bya specific point in time. Milestones can be stated quantitatively, suchas tons of incineration capacity in operation by a certain date, or canbe described qualitatively as unique policy components, such as implementationof certain defined procedures in a state siting program by a specifieddate.<T3>Needs Assessment</T3>. This is an evaluation of current and futureneeds for hazardous waste management capacity. An assessment includes estimationof current and projected future waste generation, evaluation of currentand imminent capacity, and calculation of capacity shorfalls or need forincreased management capacity. It may also include an analysis of currentand suggested state policies in hazardous waste management. A needs assessmentprovides a basis for state planning for future hazardous waste management,helping the state to choose among alternative approaches to satisfyingdemand for sound management capacity, and publicizes the state's marketneeds to private suppliers. A needs assessment is a statement of the state'sposition in waste management and does not necessarily lead to the state'sactive involvement in capacity expansion or site selection.<T3>Negotiation</T3>. This consists of mediated and nonmediated interactionsbetween the proponent of a specific hazardous waste management facilityand representatives of the host community and other communities that arelikely to be affected by the proposed facility. Negotiation can entailclarification and resolution of issues and concerns, development of alternatives,and specification of compensation and mitigation measures accepted by bothparties.<T3>Compensation</T3>. This includes services and payments made to a hostcommunity and other affected communities to help allay burdens imposedby their proximity to a hazardous waste management facility. Compensationcan be cash payments (a given payment per ton processed) or provided in-kind(free clean-up of public hazardous waste spills, company maintenance ofaccess roads).<T3>Mitigation</T3>. These are measures implemented to minimize the impactof a hazardous waste facility on the surrounding population and the environment.Whereas compensation is meant to balance burdens, mitigation is intendedto reduce the burdens carried by host and nearby communities. Mitigationincludes restrictions on operating hours and procedures, limitations ontypes and volumes of waste accepted, stricter engineering specifications,and construction of additional safety features.<T3>Preemption</T3>. The state has the authority to make decisions in anarea normally reserved for local or county government. That is, the statesubstitutes its authority for local or county authority in a specifiedpolicy area so that a decision normally left to lower level of governmentis taken at a higher level of government which is not required, under preemption,to defer to local preferences.<T3>Override</T3>. The state has the authority to overrule decision madeat a lower level of government. With regard to hazardous waste management,the local jurisdiction first evaluates the case and makes a decision; thisdecision can then be appealed to the higher authority which has the rightto overturn the decision if it feels justified.<T3>Facility Expansion</T3>. This is any increase in capacity of an existinghazardous waste facility. This can refer to construction of plant additionsor substitution of new equipment for older equipment with a concomitantability to handle greater volumes of waste.<T3>Siting Application</T3>. This is a request for state agency approvalof a specific hazardous waste facility on a designated site. Applicationcontains engineering specifications of the facility, description of wastesand technical processes, information on the developer, as well as environmentaland geological description of the site and surrounding area.<T3>Adjudicatory Hearing</T3>. This is a public hearing to gather evidenceand arrive at a decision on a proposed facility, structured like a judicialreview. Interested parties present evidence to influence the final decisionand are generally subject to cross examination as part of the process.Based on evaluation of the evidence presented, the hearing examiner ruleson the suitability of the proposed facility (granting or denying a permit)or makes a recommendation to the permitting authority on whether or notthe facility should be approved.<T3>Informational Hearing</T3>. This is a public hearing for disseminationof information and airing of opinions on a proposed facility. Representativesof all interested parties can make presentations and discuss areas of concern,evidence is collected and turned over to permitting authorities for consideration;the hearing administrator presides and ensures proper procedure but doesnot rule on the proposed facility.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-19414 Filed 8-30-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
