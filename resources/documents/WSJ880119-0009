Assistant Attorney General William Weld, head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said he wants to add 35 to 40 people to the network of federal officials that is tracking down securities violations in New York.    Of the total, he said, six to eight would be additional prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office, which now has as many as eight to 10 lawyers working on securities fraud. The rest would be secretaries and investigators. Agencies that would be asked to contribute investigative staff, he said, include the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Customs Service and Postal Service.    The added manpower has been requested by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, Mr. Weld said. &quot;He thinks there's enough business there to support doubling the current effort.&quot;    An expansion of the securities investigations would sharpen fears among potential Wall Street targets. Some in the securities industry have questioned if the U.S. attorney's office has adequate staff to follow through on its securities-fraud cases. A major investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is under way. Prosecutors have indicated they will seek new indictments of Robert Freeman, head of arbitrage for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., and Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. former arbitragers Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor. Kidder Peabody is a subsidiary of General Electric Co. The added manpower could allow Mr. Giuliani's office and the SEC to follow more of the leads they have developed and bring cases to trial faster.    But the Justice Department hasn't given final approval to the plan and many details need to be worked out, Mr. Weld said. He said the department would fund its additional slots internally, without seeking a budget increase from Congress, but hasn't figured out whether it would require staff reductions in other prosecutors' offices. He said he hasn't formally discussed the proposal with SEC Chairman David Ruder and other agencies whose participation would be needed.    Justice Department officials also are planning to launch an interagency working group to speed prosecution of securities violations outside of New York, Mr. Weld said. He said this project has been endorsed by Attorney General Edwin Meese and welcomed by the SEC's Mr. Ruder.    The group would be modeled after one established in 1985 to promote bank-fraud prosecutions, said William Hendricks III, head of the department's fraud section.    That group is credited with streamlining bank regulators' referral of criminal cases to the Justice Department. Also through the group, bank regulators have pressured U.S. attorneys in some districts to accelerate work on lagging bank fraud cases. And the group enabled understaffed U.S. attorneys' offices to obtain 15 fraud section attorneys to help them with bank frauds.    The interagency securities group would include representatives from the Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Futures Trading Commission, as well as from the New York and American stock exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, according to Mr. Weld.    The group would make formal contacts that Justice Department officials have worked for years to improve in a less-structured setting. But some securities lawyers are skeptical of the group's value. &quot;I don't know if this really adds anything,&quot; said New York securities attorney Kenneth Bialkin.    Gary Lynch, the SEC enforcement chief, said, &quot;it's something we'll work with Justice on, certainly.&quot; He added: &quot;Anytime there are more resources directed toward securities prosecution, (it's for) the better, as far as I'm concerned.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
