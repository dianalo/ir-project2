On September 1, 1983, USEPA returned to Ohio EPA asincomplete a number of draft and final SIP revision requests for sourceswhich are located in urban nonattainment areas lacking current attainmentdemonstrations. The DairyPak revision request was included among thosereturned to the State. Because these were requests to change applicableSIP requirements in areas lacking current attainment demonstrations, therequests were considered incomplete.In a letter dated February 28, 1985, USEPA requested that Ohio EPA notifythe Region V office of its preferred disposition of each submittal withintwo weeks. If the Ohio EPA elected to withdraw the revisions, USEPA statedit would take no further action on them. If, on the other hand, the Statedid not withdraw them, USEPA stated that it would have to propose disapprovalbecause they were requests to relax applicable SIP requirements in areaslacking current attainment demonstrations. On April 4, 1985, the Statenotified USEPA that it still considered each of these SIP revision requestspending and requested USEPA to approve them. As discussed further below,USEPA subsequently proposed to disapprove the DairyPak revision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of SIP Revision</ITAG>Champion International Corporation, DairyPak Division, operates eight flexographicprinting lines in Olmsted Falls (Cuyahoga County). The lines are used forthe printing of polyethylene-coated paper milk cartons. Because DairyPakhas chosen to pursue a waterborne ink conversion program, it is subjectto the control requirements of the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) Rule3745-21-09(Y)(1)(a)(ii)\1\<NOTE/> which requires that the VOC content of each coating and inkemployed in the printing lines not exceed 25 percent by volume of the volatilecontent. In addition, DairyPak is also subject to the December 31, 1982,compliance date contained in OAC Rule 3745-21-04(C)(32). In lieu of therequirements mentioned above, Ohio EPA has submitted an alternative emissionreduction plan (bubble)\2\<NOTE/> and an extended compliance date to December 31, 1987, forDairyPak. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ If the source had chosen a low-solvent conversion programit would be subject to 3745-21-09(Y)(1)(a). If the source complied by theuse of add-on control equipment, it would be subject to OAC Rule 3745-21-09(Y)(1)(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ On April 7, 1982 (47 FR 15076), USEPA issued a proposedEmissions Trading Policy Statement, and on December 4, 1986 (51 FR 43814),USEPA issued a final Emissions Trading Policy Statement. These policy statementsset forth general principles for the creation, banking and use of emissionreduction credits.DairyPak has employed solvent-based coatings and inks in the printing lines.During 1981, the base year, the VOC emissions from these sources were approximately261 tons, or 2.96 pounds of VOC per pound of coating and ink solids deliveredto the lines. Under the proposed bubble, DairyPak will convert to waterbornecoatings and inks in order to obtain an emission reduction of 196 tons/yearfrom the facility. This overall reduction in 1981 base year emissions willresult in a VOC emission rate of 0.74 pounds of VOC per pound of coatingand ink solids. This limit is generally equivalent to the 75 percent overallreduction requirement that would be achieved if DairyPak were to strictlycomply with the requirements of OAC Rule 3745-21-09(Y)(1)(a)(ii). It shouldbe noted that a September 9, 1987, policy memorandum titled ``AlternativeCompliance for Graphic Arts RACT'' states that USEPA will accept an emissionlimit of 0.5 pounds of VOC per pound of solids in the ink as an alternativeemission limit which is essentially equivalent to the Reasonable AvailableControl Technology (RACT) level recommended in the Graphic Arts ControlTechnique Guideline (CTG), ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions FromExisting Sources Volume VIII: Graphic Arts, Rotogravure, and Flexography.''Because the State submitted the requested SIP revision for DairyPak beforethe above cited memorandum, USEPA is determining that 0.74 pounds of VOCper pound of coating and ink solids constitutes RACT for DairyPak. RACTdeterminations in the future, however, may generally not consider an alternativepounds VOC per pound of ink solids limit above 0.5 to constitute RACT.Under this bubble, some of the printing lines would be able to emit abovethe 0.74 limitation, and others would be below it. The variance would permitcompliance with this limit to be determined on a monthly basis.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Ohio SIP Rule 3745-21-09(B) requires compliance to bedetermined on a daily basis. In the effort to ensure reasonable progress in achieving the alternativeemission limitation, minimum reductions in the monthly average VOC contentof all coatings and inks have been specified in the variances. In addition,the variances contain recordkeeping and reporting requirements. If compliance with the alternative limitation of 0.74 pound of VOC perpound of coating and ink solids cannot be achieved solely through the useof waterborne coatings and inks, the variance requires the installationof add-on control equipment, as necessary, to achieve compliance with therequirements of OAC Rule 3745-21-09(Y)(1)(b) by December 31, 1987. On September 9, 1985 (50 FR 36633), USEPA proposed to disapprove the ChampionInternational Corporation's DairyPak Division SIP revision for the followingreasons: (1) The revision request does not contain adequate support that the compliancedate extension to December 1987 is expeditious. (2) The source is located in an area (Cuyahoga County) which lacks bothan approved 1982 Ozone SIP and an approved attainment demonstration. UnderUSEPA's policy,\4\<NOTE/> sources which are located in areas which lack an approvedSIP cannot be considered for longer averaging periods or compliance dateextensions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ USEPA's policy regarding longer averaging periods is specifiedin a memorandum dated January 20, 1984, from: John R. O'Connor, ActingDirector, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to: Director, AirManagement Division, Regions I-X, entitled ``Averaging Times for ComplianceWith VOC Emission Limits_SIP Revision Policy.'' (3) The revision request also lacked adequate support for the monthly averagingcompliance method specified in the revision request. <ITAG tagnum="84">USEPA's Bubble Policies </ITAG>On April 7, 1982 (47 FR 15076), USEPA issued a proposed Emissions TradingPolicy Statement (ETPS) which sets forth general principles for the creation,banking and use of emission reduction credits (Bubble). This statementindicates that it is USEPA's policy to encourage use of emission tradesto achieve more flexible, rapid and efficient attainment of national ambientair quality standards (NAAQS). It describes emissions trading, sets outgeneral principles that USEPA will use to evaluate emissions trades underthe Clean Air Act, and expands opportunities for States and industry touse these less costly control approaches. The April 7, 1982, notice statedthat until USEPA took final action on its policy statement, State actionsinvolving emission trades would be evaluated under the provisions set forthin the proposed statement. On December 4, 1986 (51 FR 53814), USEPA issuedits final ETPS, which contains the criteria by which emission trades willbe evaluated. This bubble is based on a weighted average emission limit for the eightprinting lines. The limit is 0.74 pound of VOC per pound of coating andink solids, which is a 75 percent reduction from the 1981 emission rateof 2.96 pounds of VOC per pound of coating and ink solids. This limit isgenerally equivalent to RACT-level control. The reductions are to be achievedthrough the use of waterborne coatings and inks. The actual and allowableemissions are summarized in the following table: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s15,5,5,5,5 </C><T4>Emissions (tons/year)  </T4><H1>Sources </H1><H1>Actual </H1><H2>Before bubble </H2><H2>After bubble </H2><H1>Allowable </H1><H2>Before bubble </H2><H2>After bubble</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">8 flexographic printing lines <D>261 </D><D>65 </D><D>65 </D><D>65</D></ITAG></ITAG>  The ``after bubble'' emissions are based on a 75 percent reduction fromthe 1981 level. Because the source must only meet a limit of 0.74 poundof VOC per gallon of coating and ink solids, it is possible for both actualand allowable emissions to increase if production increases. DairyPak's proposed bubble is considered a ``pending bubble application''because it was submitted to Ohio in 1982 and had been pending at USEPA.The technical issues document of the bubble policy states the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">In primary nonattainment areas needing but lacking demonstrations,these bubbles should contribute to progress towards attainment. ``Progresstowards attainment'' means some extra reduction beyond equivalence, withthe lowest-of-actual-SIP-allowable-or-RACT-allowable emissions baselineapplied as of the time applicants originally sought credit.''</ITAG>The December 4, 1986 emission trade policy states that ``Pending bubblesmay undergo limited modification by the States or sources which submittedthem in order to meet the new requirements outlined in the bubble policyabove.'' Thus, if the only major deficiency with the bubble is that itdoes not meet the requirement ``to contribute with progress toward attainment,''the State may add new controls in order to show progress toward attainment,and the bubble would retain its ``pending'' status. However, if other majorrequirements have not been met by the bubble that were required prior tothe December 4, 1986 policy (such as failure to justify long-term averaging),the State would need to resubmit the bubble, and it would lose its pendingstatus.This bubble merely complies with a level of control generally equivalentto the SIP approved emission limits and does not provide ``progress towardsattainment,'' which is a requirement for areas that lack an approved attainmentdemonstration. This requirement is applicable to VOC sources in the Clevelanddemonstration area.\5\<NOTE/> The emission rate factor for such baselines is based on theactual emission rate, the SIP or other Federally enforceable emission limit,or a RACT emission limit, whichever is lower, as of the Source's applicationto trade. Therefore, because the bubble was submitted in September, 1982,the emission rate factor must be consistent with the lowest of actual orallowable emission rate in September 1982, not 1981.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ USEPA recognizes that these reasons for disapproval werenot noted in the September 9, 1985 proposal (because it arose from changesembodied in the December 4, 1986, final ETPS). However, USEPA is disapprovingthe DairyPak revision request primarily because of the reasons listed inthe September 9, 1985, proposal which have not changed, but notes thatits failure to meet the requirements of the December 4, 1986, ETPS is anadditional reason why the DairyPak revision is not approvable.<ITAG tagnum="84">USEPA's Policy for Relaxing Emissions in Nonattainment Areas</ITAG>As discussed below, the extended averaging time requested by Ohio for DairyPakconstitutes a relaxation from current requirements applicable to the source.Under U.S. EPA policy, as indicated in a July 29, 1983, memorandum fromSheldon E. Myers, former Director of the Office of Air Quality Planningand Standard, USEPA will not approve a SIP revision allowing relaxed emissionstandards in a nonattainment area, unless the State demonstrates that theSIP as a whole, as revised, will result in attainment by the applicabledate. This requirement has not been met here. Cuyahoga County is an ozonenonattainment area and, as such, must be subject to an USEPA-approved SIPdemonstrating attainment as expeditiously as practicable, but no laterthan the end of 1987. At the time this SIP revision was submitted (August29, 1983) this area did not have an approved 1982 Ozone SIP. The Statesubmitted a revised SIP, but, until very recently, this submission lackedcertain RACT rules, and thus could not be approved. On May 26, 1988, USEPAnotified the Governor of Ohio, through issuance of a SIP call, that theCuyahoga County ozone SIP is substantially inadequate to assure the attainmentof the ozone NAAQS. The State has very recently submitted the requiredRACT rules. However, in light of the SIP call, the SIP submitted to dateis not approvable. In a separate notice, USEPA will be addressing the deficienciesassociated with the State of Ohio's proposed 1982 Ozone SIP revision. Accordingly,at no time since the State submitted the DairyPak SIP revision to EPA hasthe area had an approved 1982 Ozone SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments </ITAG>During the public comment period, USEPA received one set of comments submittedon behalf of Champion International Corporation during the public commentperiod and another set of comments submitted on behalf of Champion afterthe close of the comment period. Because these comments generally addressthe SIP deficiencies discussed in the notice of proposed rulemaking, abrief discussion of each deficiency is provided, along with the commentand USEPA's response. For a more detailed discussion of each deficiency,see USEPA's proposed rulemaking (September 9, 1985, 50 FR 36633).1. SIP Deficiency: Compliance Date ExtensionThe revision request does not contain adequate support that the compliancedate extension to December 1987 is expeditious. In addition, USEPA cannotapprove a compliance date extension in an area that lacks an approvableattainment demonstration, because without such a demonstration it is impossiblefor USEPA to determine whether the requested SIP variance will interfere(1) with attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS and (2) with therequirement that nonattainment areas demonstrate ``Reasonable Further Progress''(RFP) toward the goal of attainment prior to the final attainment date.<T3>Comment.</T3> The commenter submitted documentation to support itsposition that its low solvent conversion program is expeditious. Additionally,after the close of the comment period the commenter submitted additionalinformation. The commenter referenced USEPA's notice of proposed rulemakingproposing to disapprove a revision for the Van Leer Containers, Inc. facility(December 2, 1986, 51 FR 43387). The revision requested a permanent relaxationof the emission limits for Van Leer's interior drum coatings. DairyPakstates that, ``Unlike the Van Leer's revision, which would authorize apermanent relaxation of emission requirements, the Champion revision providesfor an extended time in which overall emissions from its flexographic printinglines can be reduced to a level equivalent to that provided for under theapplicable Ohio SIP provision, OAC 3745-21-09(Y). The purpose of the extendedtime was to provide sufficient time for the full development of waterbasedinks conversion and VOC emission reduction.'' The commenter makes referenceto an April 25, 1980, policy memorandum from USEPA entitled ``ComplianceSchedules for Low Solvent Technology Programs for the Graphic Arts CTGCategory.'' The commenter states that this memorandum recognizes the needfor additional time to develop water-based inks for conversion and VOCemission reduction. The commenter states that complying inks are not andhave never been ``reasonably available.''<T3>USEPA's Response:</T3> USEPA is not evaluating whether USEPA's ComplianceDate extension policies are met in this notice because there are othergrounds for disapproving the State's proposed revision. This approach isbeing taken to enable USEPA to act quickly on the State's submittal. Ifthe State submits another proposed compliance extension for this source,it will, of course, have to meet USEPA's compliance date extension policyto be approvable.<T3>Comment:</T3> The supplemental comments submitted after the close ofthe comment period also discussed another test set forth in USEPA's proposalto  disapprove the Van Leer Containers revision request. The commenterstated that the second prong of the test set forth in the Van Leer proposalis whether, if compliance materials (coatings, or in the case of Champion,inks) are not available, the materials used result in reduced emissionsgiven customer demands. The commenter believes Champion's proposed revisionalso meets this test. The commenter states that in the Champion revision,in contrast to the Van Leer revision, there is no element of permanentuse of higher solvent inks; rather, the essence of the Champion programis a continuing, and progressive search for compliance inks which meetcustomers' needs.<T3>USEPA's Response:</T3> It is not necessary to respond to this commentbecause USEPA is not relying on the compliance date extension policiesto disapprove this SIP revision.<T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter states that the uncertainty of the effectivenessof add-on controls plus the greater reduction in emissions required bythe SIP variance adequately demonstrates that Champion's requested varianceguarantees more RFP than would otherwise occur. <T3>USEPA's Response: </T3>USEPA does not agree with the commenter's conclusionthat, because a successful low solvent conversion program would resultin a greater reduction than add-on controls, this time extension wouldnot interfere with RFP. USEPA disagrees for two reasons. First, DairyPak'svariance does not require its final emission limitation to be more stringentthan Ohio's SIP limit (contained in OAC Rule 3745-21-09(Y)(1)(a)). In fact,Ohio EPA states in its June 20, 1983, draft variance fact sheet that ``the75 percent overall reduction is equivalent to the reductions that wouldbe achieved if DairyPak were to strictly comply with the requirements ofOAC Rule 3745-21-09(Y)(1)(a) (ii) * * *.'' In addition, without an approvedattainment demonstration, it is not possible to make a determination ofwhat quantity of emissions would interfere with RFP. That is, there isno yardstick by which to judge DairyPak's emissions in excess of the allowablefor the years 1983 through 1987. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter makes reference to an April 11, 1985, letterfrom Ohio EPA to USEPA which is intended to confirm ``that Ohio EPA doesnot intend to seek any reductions from the Flexographic Printing Industryor other RACT-Category II sources beyond our current rules, or, in thecase of DairyPak, the 1983 variances.'' This letter is cited to show thatOhio does not intend to require DairyPak to reduce emissions further whenit develops a revised SIP for Cuyahoga County. <T3>USEPA's Response: </T3>Ohio EPA's decision as to how it plans to achievecompliance with the ozone NAAQS in Cuyahoga County is speculative, andcannot be relied upon until such time as there is an approved 1982 ozoneSIP, and attainment demonstration, for the Cleveland demonstration area.USEPA cannot approve a relaxation in an area that lacks an approved attainmentdemonstration because without such a demonstration it is impossible forUSEPA to determine whether or not the requested SIP variance will interferewith attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS and with the requirementthat nonattainment areas demonstrate RFP prior to the final attainmentdate. USEPA's policy is set forth in a July 29, 1983, memorandum from SheldonMeyers, former Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards,to the Regional Offices. On July 25, 1984 (49 FR 29973), USEPA proposedto disapprove the Ohio 1982 ozone SIP for the Cleveland ozone nonattainmentarea, which includes Cuyahoga County, based on measured violations of theozone NAAQS in 1983. Therefore, because the State of Ohio does not yethave an approved attainment demonstration, USEPA cannot approve relaxations(e.g., monthly averaging) for sources in Cuyahoga County. 2. SIP Deficiency: Monthly Averaging in Areas Lacking an Approved SIP The DairyPak facility is located in an area (Cuyahoga County) which lacksboth an approved 1982 ozone SIP and an approved attainment demonstration.Under USEPA's SIP revision policy, sources which are located in such areascannot be considered for longer averaging periods until an approvable attainmentdemonstration is provided showing timely attainment and maintenance ofthe ozone standard, and with the requirement that areas demonstrate ``reasonablefurther progress'' toward the goal of attainment. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter cites the following portion of the January20, 1984, policy memorandum on extended averaging:<ITAG tagnum="21">Regulatory actions that incorporate longer term averages to circumventthe installation of overall RACT level controls cannot be allowed.</ITAG>The company claims that its variance achieves greater emission reductionsthan RACT and questions USEPA's position in light of the present statusof its low solvent conversion program. The company states that it is convertingto low solvent coatings as expeditiously as possible, given inherent testingdelays and customer satisfaction requirements. <T3>USEPA's Response: </T3>The deficiency cited in the Notice of ProposedRulemaking is based upon the provision in the January 20, 1984, policymemorandum which states that ``sources in areas lacking approved SIP's* * * cannot be considered for longer term averages until the SIP has beenrevised demonstrating ambient standards attainment and maintenance of RFP.''Extended averaging cannot be considered for the Cleveland demonstrationarea until there is an approved 1982 ozone SIP for this area. The commenter'sresponse is not relevant to the stated deficiency. Furthermore, as discussedpreviously, the variance for DairyPak is not ``better than RACT'' becauseit does not require a more stringent limitation than what is containedin the SIP for a low solvent conversion program.<T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter states that, except for the lack of anapproved attainment demonstration, Champion's proposal conforms to allof the other guidelines developed in the January 20, 1984 policy memorandum.<T3>USEPA's Response: </T3>The lack of an approved attainment demonstrationis sufficient reason to disapprove a request for extended averaging. Withoutan approved attainment demonstration it is impossible to determine theextent to which emissions in excess of those allowed by the SIP can occurwithout interfering with ambient standards attainment and RFP. The infeasibility of daily averaging must also be supported in order toapprove a request for extended averaging. This issue is discussed furtherbelow. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter believes that the flexographic emissionlimit rule has little, if any, logical relation to compliance on a short-termbasis. It also states that, due to the 100-ton exemption in the rule, aflexographic facility can emit 100 tons per year, all on a single day,in one week or, in one month. <T3>USEPA Response: </T3>The Champion International Corporation, DairyPakis subject to Rule OAC 3745-21-09(B) which requires compliance on a dailybasis. The provisions in the January 20, 1984, policy memorandum are necessarybecause the ozone NAAQS is a short-term standard and the use of monthlyaveraging could allow the daily emissions to significantly exceed the allowablelevel under the SIP. Although it is theoretically possible for a source to emit its total annualemissions of 100 tons per year in one day, this occurrence is implausible.In any case, the 100-ton exemption for graphic arts sources, does not constitutejustification of extended averaging. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter references deposition testimony by a USEPAengineer in a pending enforcement action against Champion pursuant to section113(b) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7413(b). It then makes the claimthat 24-hour average compliance can be determined from long-term data andthat daily emissions vary about the mean by only a few percentage points.<T3>USEPA Response: </T3>The commenter appears to have misunderstood USEPA'stestimony. There is no USEPA approved procedure which can be used to calculateactual daily VOC emissions from long-term data. However, even if such aprocedure existed, it would not prevent emissions from exceeding the dailyallowable emission level in Ohio's existing SIP. In addition, there isno way of ensuring that, on any given day, the VOC emissions from a sourcewill deviate from the mean by only a few percentage points. The commenter'shypothesis would not satisfy the stated deficiency even if it were true,because daily emissions could still exceed the SIP allowable. 3. SIP Deficiency: Inadequate Documentation To Support Extended AveragingAccording to the Agency's January 20, 1984, SIP revision policy mentionedearlier, a demonstration to support extended averaging must show that eitherthe source operations are such that daily VOC emissions cannot be determinedor the application of RACT is not economically or technically feasibleon a daily basis. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter submitted an ``ink usage study'' developedover a two-week period at its operation in Fort Worth, Texas. This studydevelops the ``current annual costs of daily monitoring at a flexographicfacility whose operations are nearly identical to those at Olmsted Fallsbased on the average man-hours expended, costs incurred, and recordkeepingrequirements involved in daily monitoring. The final annual operating costof over $216,000 does not include the capital cost of the scales necessaryto accomplish the nearly 500 weighing operations which would be requiredon each shift.'' This study was based upon daily line-by-line monitoringof ink and solvent usage on each flexographic printing line. The commenteralso submitted an analysis of the number and size of production runs overa six-month period. During the six-month period, Champion filled 22,354customer job orders for a total production of 757,343,708 cartons. Thecompany keeps virtually no inventory and must be able to meet its customers'short-notice requirements. The commenter claims that as a result of theserestrictions it is impossible for it to schedule its production in sucha fashion as to assure VOC emission compliance on a short-term basis. Champion'sorder analysis for April 1985 through September 1985, appears to reference29 different products. <T3>USEPA Response: </T3>The commenter's cost analysis is based upon arecording of the amount of ink and solvent used on every job, on everyline throughout the day. However, because Ohio EPA is requesting a bubblefor DairyPak, there is no apparent reason to determine the ink and solventusage for each line. The commenter has not explained why an inventory ofinks and solvents performed once per day, or some other recordkeeping systemless burdensome than the one it described, would not be sufficient to determinedaily emissions. A potential alternative method for determining daily compliancecould be for the source to determine the quantity of ink and solvent associatedwith each product. Daily emissions could then be obtained by consideringthe ink usage associated with its daily production.  Longer-term averaging can be justified by a demonstration that the applicationof RACT for each emission point is not economically or technically feasibleon a daily basis. However, DairyPak has not provided sufficient informationdemonstrating that, upon completion of its conversion program, it willbe infeasible to convert a sufficient number of solvent-based inks andcoatings to allow DairyPak to comply on a daily basis. For these reasons,it is USEPA's view that DairyPak has not adequately demonstrated that itshould be allowed to determine compliance with VOC emission limits on amonthly basis. 4. Additional Comments <T3>Comment: </T3>USEPA has no discretion or authority to disapprove theSIP revision if it complies with the criteria set forth in section 110(a)(2)of the Clean Air Act. Because the revision satisfies section 110(a)(2),USEPA must approve it. <T3>Response: </T3>As discussed earlier in this notice, since the Statehas not demonstrated that the SIP revision for DairyPak will assure attainmentand maintenance of the ozone standard as required by section 110(a)(2)of the Clean Air Act, USEPA must disapprove it. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter suggests that USEPA was required undersection 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act to act within four months of thesubmission of the variance. The company further states that policies developedafter the four month period would not be applicable. <T3>USEPA Response: </T3>Although section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Actestablishes a four-month requirement for original State plans submittedpursuant to section 110(a)(1), subsequent revisions are governed by section110(a)(3)(A), which imposes no statutory deadline. In light of the absenceof a mandatory review deadline for such revisions, the Agency contendsthat its obligation under the Act is to act within a reasonable time, asdetermined by the Administrator. Because the four-month time period raisedby the commenter is not applicable, the issue of policy developed afterthat period is not relevant. In any case, USEPA clarification of currentAgency policy generally are applicable to all SIP revision requests onwhich USEPA has not yet taken final action. <T3>Comment: </T3>The commenter believes that the conversion program embodiedin the proposed SIP revision is the only feasible alternative for insuringappropriate reductions in VOC emissions at Champion's DairyPak Facility.The commenter claims that use of add-on control is both technically infeasibleand economically unreasonable at its plant. This conclusion is based ona report which states an ``inability to capture anywhere near the requisite65 percent of VOC emissions.'' Champion claims add-on control to be economically unreasonable becausea report by a consultant estimated the cost of control equipment between$3,210 and $10,709 per ton of VOC controlled.<T3>USEPA Response: </T3>Because USEPA's proposed disapproval was not basedupon an evaluation of the feasibility of add-on control for the DairyPakplant, Champion's comment is not relevant to this rulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="84">SIP Deviations </ITAG>This notice specifies major deficiencies which render this proposed revisionto be unapprovable. However, it should be noted that if Ohio corrects thedeficiencies cited in this notice, it should also ensure conformance withthe USEPA requirements specified in Appendix D of the Post-1987 Ozone Policy,titled ``Discrepancies and Inconsistencies Found in Current SIP's'', andin the ``SIP Approvability Checklist_Enforceability'', which is attachedto the September 23, 1987, policy memorandum titled ``Review of State ImplementationPlans and Revisons for Enforceability and Legal Sufficiency'', before resubmittingthe DairyPak SIP revision to USEPA for its approval. These two documentscontain USEPA requirements, largely dealing with enforceability, whichmust be met for a site-specific SIP revision to be approved. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action </ITAG>Based upon a review of the SIP revision request and each of the publiccomments raised on behalf of Champion International Corporation, USEPAis taking final action to disapprove the SIP revision for Champion InternationalCorporation's DairyPak Division in Olmsted Falls, Ohio for the followingreasons: (1) The source is located in an area (Cuyahoga County) that lacks an approved1982 ozone SIP and an approved attainment demonstration. Under USEPA'sSIP revision policy and the CAA, sources that are located in areas lackingan approved SIP cannot be considered for longer averaging periods. Untilan approvable attainment demonstration is provided and approved by USEPA,the Agency cannot evaluate whether granting a relaxation will interferewith attainment of the ozone standard or with the requirement of RFP. (2) The source has failed to demonstrate that it is not feasible for itto determine VOC emissions on a daily basis or that the application ofRACT is economically or technically infeasible on a daily basis. (3) The revision request does not comply with the provisions of the December4, 1986, ETPS. This bubble request does not provide ``progress towardsattainment'' which is a requirement for pending bubbles in nonattainmentareas that lack an approved attainment demonstration. In addition, Ohiohas not documented the lowest-of-actual-SIP-allowable-or-RACT allowable emissions baseline as of the time the bubble was submitted to Ohio.
