The Cinnaminson, N.J., biotechnology firm said the patentcovers its process of transferring into various plants thegene for chitinase, an enzyme that breaks down chitin, acrucial component of many fungi.</LP><TEXT>   Many plants naturally produce chitinase, but not insufficient quantities or at the right time to fight offharmful fungi, the company said. Currently, chemicalfungicides are used to protect plants.   Products incorporating the new process would not reachsupermarkets before the mid-1990s, the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
