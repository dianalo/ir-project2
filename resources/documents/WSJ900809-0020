Since Aug. 1, pump prices have jumped more than 16 cents agallon to an average of $1.24 a gallon. Each day at thatlevel costs U.S. motorists about $50 million more than beforethe Middle East crisis began.</LP><TEXT>   Politicians berated oil-industry executives in hearings onCapitol Hill Tuesday. And yesterday morning President Bushpublicly admonished oil companies to do their &quot;fair share&quot;during the crisis to &quot;show restraint&quot; with gasoline prices.Still, despite all the furor, considerable confusion remainsabout just who did what and why -- and what might happen atthe gasoline pump next.   Here are some commonly asked questions:                                                                                                          Q: Oil prices fell sharply yesterday, so can we expectgasoline pump prices to fall overnight the way they roseovernight?   A: Not that fast. It looks like some are headed down, butdon't rush out looking for a bargain everywhere this morning.Gasoline in the commodity market fell more than six cents agallon yesterday, and Phillips Petroleum Co. cut wholesaleprices some yesterday. Atlantic Richfield promised to freezeprices for a week. BP and Chevron Corp. say they are holdingfor now.   Don't look for huge declines, though. You may think youhave been gouged by the price run-up, but oil companies thinkyou have been lucky. They say crude prices jumped as much as$10 a barrel since early July; that should translate into atleast a 25-cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline prices once thecrude is refined. So by that reckoning, prices still aren'tup enough.   But back to the price-lag question. &quot;Retail prices go upmuch faster than they come down,&quot; says a spokesman for theAutomobile Association of America. And he's right. Someexperts suggest that's because it's generally a dramatic newsevent that triggers an upswing and the slow-movingmarketplace that brings prices down. If the marketplace letsa company hold onto a higher price, it does.                                                                                                          Q: It sure sounds like oil companies are ripping us off;are they?   A: There's no doubt Big Oil is making a lot more money nowthan a month ago, mostly because it's selling its crude for alot more money. Its refinery profit margins of well over $4 abarrel are also high right now, because it is, indeed,selling high-priced gasoline that was made with $18 crudeinstead of $28 crude. But oil companies are telling the truthabout what happened at the pump; competition actuallyrestrained gasoline price increases until the Iraqi invasion.In July, companies weren't able to pass along rising crudecosts into gasoline pump prices.   Third-quarter and especially fourth-quarter profits couldbe enormous if these market conditions last, but companiesmay try to mask some of that surge. &quot;All the companies have ahuge piggy bank that allows them to hide gains of anextraordinary type&quot; in their earnings reports, says BernardPicchi, a Salomon Brothers Inc. oil analyst, referring to oilcompanies' ability to take certain charges at times of theirchoosing.   At the retail level, location can determine whetherdealers are experiencing a windfall. &quot;If he doesn't feel anycompetition, he's free to charge whatever he wants tocharge,&quot; Mr. Picchi says. But if a dealer is competingagainst a company-owned service station in a heavy-trafficarea, odds are he's facing some price heat and his margin mayactually have been cut by the price rises.                                                                                                          Q: What can I do about all this?   A: A few things could ease your pain. If you're buyinghigher-priced, high-octane gasoline, check the owner'smanual. You might be pleased to discover you don't need it.Octane of 87 is sufficient for the vast majority of cars onthe road today, auto makers say. The price difference betweenregular unleaded and super unleaded can be as high as 20cents a gallon, so if you drop all the way from premium toregular, you've eliminated all of the recent price boost.Voila -- and your car is still happy.   About 30% of all gasoline sold is super unleaded; &quot;oilcompanies are really making a killing&quot; on that growingconsumer habit, Mr. Picchi says. He figures motorists areunnecessarily &quot;octaning up&quot; to the tune of $3.8 billion ayear.   Obviously, you can also keep an eye out for the cheapeststation regardless of the brand. There are still many local,cut-rate brands around. And you usually don't have to worry:&quot;Gasoline is gasoline,&quot; Mr. Picchi says. In fact, it's commonfor one company to sell another company's gasoline under itsown brand name, and for off-brand stations to buy frombrand-name refiners.                                                                                                          Q: Why don't companies wait to raise prices until thathigher-priced crude actually arrives as gasoline at thecorner service station?   A: Companies say they must base their gasoline prices onthe &quot;replacement cost&quot; of the crude oil they are buying intoday's markets. About two-thirds of all the oil imported tothe U.S. is priced at a &quot;spot market&quot; cost once it hits U.S.shores, so companies are immediately paying for higher-pricedcrudes to fuel their refineries. &quot;People think oil pricestake 60 days to pass through the system, but that's not thecase,&quot; says Ken Miller, a senior principal at the consultingfirm Purvin andamp; Gertz Inc. in Houston.                                                                                                          Q: Do oil companies talk to each other about price?   A: God forbid, they say. &quot;We have no conversations withother oil companies on price,&quot; says Robert Rauscher,marketing vice president for Amoco Corp. &quot;We make doggonecertain we don't even come close.&quot; One public relationsexecutive for a major oil company says he was lectured forseveral hours earlier this week by company lawyers onantitrust law. &quot;They're absolutely paranoid about signalingprice changes,&quot; the executive says. &quot;It's a very sensitiveand real issue.&quot;                                                                                                          Q: How come gasoline prices moved up seemingly in unison?   A: The gasoline market, like the crude oil market, is aninternational commodity market, and prices have surged acrossthe globe for the same reason in each -- fear of supplydisruption. Traders looking at computer screens from New Yorkto Singapore, as well as giant companies, big wholesalers andeven corner service stations, all know the up-to-the-minuteprice. &quot;We look at gasoline prices every day,&quot; says Amoco'sMr. Rauscher.   At corner service stations, the cause is a littledifferent. They generally don't have much inventory and getnew shipments often. &quot;The average guy in the corner stationhas a supply of less than a week,&quot; Mr. Rauscher says. &quot;Theproduct moves through {the entire system} very rapidly.&quot; Sowhen the truck arrives and the station operator has to paymore immediately, he raises his price accordingly -- andimmediately.   In addition, gasoline imports play a big role. The U.S.imports about 16.8 million gallons of gasoline a day fromplaces like Europe and South America, and most of the timewhen it arrives here, it commands the spot commodity-marketprice, not the price that prevailed when it left home. Plus,some gasoline-exporters now are holding onto inventories,driving the price of foreign gasoline up more. Europeans inparticular, says Mr. Miller of Purvin andamp; Gertz, &quot;are going tobe holding onto their own {gasoline} there.&quot;                                                                                                          Q: Couldn't a company hold the line or undercut itscompetitors and try to gain market share?   A: It could, but most experts agree that would be risky.If a refiner's wholesale price is way below everybody else's,then every dealer in town could head for that terminal to buygasoline, creating a run on supply.   BP learned that the hard way on a small scale this week.&quot;I was out of line in price in Toledo, Ohio, and my terminalwas cleaned out,&quot; says Hugh Hanna, senior vice president forretail marketing for BP America Inc. All it took was a gap offive cents per gallon. What hurt even more is that five ofBP's retail stations weren't able to get any gas from theterminal and had to close, Mr. Hanna says. &quot;It's a very, verysmall example that could be magnified all over the world.&quot;   The same holds if a corner station sets a significantlylower price; word travels fast. That dealer would get a tonof business -- maybe even have lines at the pumps -- until heran out. Then he'd be out of business. If he couldn't buy,beg or borrow more, a tough proposition in this market, he'drisk alienating regular customers.                                                                                                          Q: Shouldn't Washington lawmakers carry a big stick andjust legislate gasoline pricing?   A: &quot;They can legislate all they want,&quot; BP's Mr. Hannasays. &quot;But as long as we're dependent on imported crude, theworld will determine what the price will be.&quot; If lawmakerstry to set prices that are below world market prices, thenthe U.S. simply &quot;won't get any,&quot; Mr. Hanna says. Mr. Picchiof Salomon Brothers recalls that gasoline price andallocation controls of the 1970s actually caused shortages insome areas.
