Economists predict commodity prices will remain stablethrough 1992, and possibly longer.   But this gloomy outlook for commodity traders, who dependon price volatility to generate profits, is music to the earsof stock and bond investors. Stable commodity prices indicateinflation will remain subdued. And low inflation, economistssay, will help the economic recovery gain momentum.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Everyone loves a bull market,&quot; says William Byers,director of futures research at Bear Stearns. &quot;But stablecommodity prices are beneficial for the economy.&quot;   Such commodities as oil and scrap steel that have a broadimpact on the economy are fairly weak and are expected tocontinue to be so. Grains, with the exception of wheat, haverallied strongly at times in the past year, but then theyfell back down again. Prices of other food commodities --coffee, sugar, and cocoa -- are low and show little to nosign of improving. Precious metals, which have bothindustrial applications and are used as inflation indicators,have been in the doldrums.   The weak price trends in those commodities are reflectedin broader commodity indexes: The Commodity Research Bureau'sindex of 21 futures prices last year ranged mostly between205 (the lowest level since early 1987) and 220.   Early this year, the CRB began climbing. Analysts said arise above 220 would have indicated the start of a recoveryin commodity prices, and piercing 223 would have sent stronginflation warning signals. But the rally fizzled well beforereaching those critical levels: It peaked around 215 lastmonth, and fell back. Friday, the CRB ended at 209.58, up0.79 point.   The Goldman Sachs commodity index, which is heavilyweighted toward energy prices, also rallied early in the yearbut faltered last month. The index sank to its 1991 low of174.427 on Dec. 30, then rallied 8.5% to 189.28 on Feb. 10.The index has since slipped with sliding oil prices.   Economists say they could have predicted that commodityprices weren't going anywhere soon. Anirvan Banerji, researcheconomist at the Center for International Business CycleResearch at Columbia University, has studied the behavior ofcommodity prices in previous recessions and found currenttrends are consistent with historic patterns.   Severe recessions, such as those in the mid-1970s andearly 1980s, have tended to be followed by a year of strongrecovery, he says. Commodity prices during the periodimmediately after the recession's end have tended to risesharply and led the recoveries by about three months. Mildrecessions, such as during the early and late 1960s, havetended to be followed by weak recoveries, where commodityprices showed no early leadership, Mr. Banerji says.   In severe recessions, he explains, prices and interestrates are beaten down to the point where they are attractiveto buyers. Prices are also coming off a low base, sorecoveries appear much stronger. In mild recessions, pricesand interest rates don't fall as far so demand isn'tstimulated as much, he says.   Because the recession last year was shallow, he says, aweak recovery and stable commodity prices could be expectedthis year. Also damping commodity price movement is theslowdown in Japanese and German economies, he adds.   But the outlook for stable commodity prices is good forthe economy, Mr. Banerji adds. The longer inflation staysunder control, the more sustainable an expansion will be, inpart because low inflation allows interest rates to remainlow, he says. There is &quot;an amazingly strong&quot; relationshipbetween the length of an expansion and the length of time ittakes for prime rates to begin moving up after an expansionbegins, he says, and one of the factors that moves primerates higher is inflation.   John Murphy, president of JJM Technical Advisors inOradell, N.J., says commodities have been in a bear marketsince 1988 but showed signs of stabilizing last year.Commodity prices may be in the early process of leveling off,he says, but it is too early in the business cycle for pricesto move up significantly.   Prices may spend the next year or so simply movingsideways, he says. As a result, inflation fears will betempered, he says, which will support the bond and stocksmarkets.   Low inflation will give the Federal Reserve more room toease interest rates, he says. The Fed watches commodityprices, particularly gold, for early signs of inflation, hesays. Gold tends to lead the CRB, and its weakness is onereason Mr. Murphy isn't bullish on commodity prices overall.   Two commodities, lumber and copper, however, have ralliedrecently and hint at a recovery under way. But supplyconcerns -- caused to some extent by logging restrictions tosave the spotted owl -- are helping push lumber pricesskyward, not just increased demand.   And some analysts are skeptical that copper will hold ontoits price gains. Leanne Baker, an analyst at SalomonBrothers, expects copper will decline to an average 95 centsa pound this year from $1.05 last year. In a recent report,she cites ample London Metal Exchange stocks, which are nearan eight-year high, and weakening demand caused by slowingJapanese and German economies.   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Market participants are expecting the first estimates ofOPEC production during the second half of February to see howserious the group really is about reductions. Although theagreed-upon cutbacks by the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries aren't likely to take effect until March,the psychological effects of the February estimates shouldinfluence trading. Already, Petroleum Intelligence Weeklyestimates that OPEC's February output may fall 220,000barrels a day from the January level. A drop of an additional965,000 barrels is forecast for March.   Yet some market sources said technical factors should helpkeep at least a temporary floor under oil futures prices ataround $18.50 a barrel. Since OPEC ended its meeting on Feb.15, the price of crude oil has declined about 78 cents abarrel. Traders who had anticipated deeper output cuts by thegroup of ministers than those announced have shown theirdisappointment.   Nevertheless, crude oil for April delivery ended tradingFriday at $18.68, down seven cents a barrel. Prices forheating oil and natural gas are expected to weaken a bitbecause of of warm weather and continuing high inventories.However, heating oil contracts for March finished Friday at51.52 cents a gallon, up 0.28 cent. Natural gas for Aprildelivery rose 1.5 cents per thousand cubic feet, to finish at$1.171. Gasoline contracts for March fell to 55.50 cents agallon, down 0.78 cent.                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          Traders hope a mild rally that closed out last week cansustain itself in trading this week. The AgricultureDepartment reported Friday that beef cattle prices averaged72.70 cents a pound in February, up 3.80 cents from January.   Meanwhile, hog prices were up four cents to an average ofabout 40.40 cents a pound. This strength on the cash markethas supported futures prices. This week traders will bewatching indications of meatpackers' profit margins. Signsthat packers are able to sell processed meat for a profitshould exert upward pressure on futures prices.   Precious Metals                                                                                                          Because April gold and platinum prices stayed abovesupport levels last week, traders may now buy on dips inprice rather than sell on rallies, said Tom Griffo, metalsanalyst at Cargill Investor Services.   Traders may try to test higher prices in the metals thisweek, he said. But that doesn't mean prices will go a lothigher, he added, only that they probably won't go muchlower.   Silver was a follower all week, Mr. Griffo said, and willprobably continue to be sluggish this week.   On Friday, gold for April delivery ended at $354.10 anounce, down 90 cents. April platinum finished at $359.70 anounce, up 10 cents. March silver declined 0.30 cent an ounceto $4.10; the actively traded May contract lost 0.50 cent tofinish at $4.135.</TEXT></DOC>
