In nucleotideexcision repair an endonuclease recognizes the lesion, cuts the DNA strandand the faulty nucleotide is excised together with a number of undamagednucleotides. This seems to be the process which operates in mammaliancells after exposure to UV and a number of chemicals which introduceso called bulky lesions in the DNA. After exposure to X-rays and simplealkylating chemicals such as methyl methanesulfonate. The first stepinvolves the action of a glycosylase which only removes the damaged base.The incision is exercised by an endonuclease which recognises abasicsites. In this process, i.e. base excision repair, probably only thedamaged nucleotide is exchanged. When the damaged piece of DNA has beenremoved one would imagine that, independently of the type of lesion initiallypresent, the same types of enzymes could be used to close the gap inthe strand, this seems, however, not to be the case. In this investigationthe authors used 3-aminobenzamide (BA) or hydroxy urea (HU) combinedwith cytosine arabinoside (ara C) to study repair of damage induced byUV and a number of mutagenic chemicals. DNA strand breaks have been measuredby the DNA-unwinding technique.</TEXT></DOC>
