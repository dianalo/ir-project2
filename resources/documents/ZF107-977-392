 Solarstorms and radiation-spewing sun flares are electrical and magnetic currentsthat can alter the Earth's magnetic field.andP;  Space-based computer systems canbe damaged by such solar emissions, while ground-based computers arevulnerable to such dangers as electrical surges that can harm power grids.andO;(Solar surges were recently blamed for wiping out computer systems at theToronto Stock Exchange.)andP;  Sun-watchers say threatening sunspots will remainextremely energetic until early spring before beginning to slowly taper offinto 1993.andM;JURY SPLIT ON JOBS...It's been a little over a year since the debut of thehighly anticipated NeXT computer, but industry observers are still notconfident its future is secure.andP;  Company founder Steve Jobs is optimistic,however, especially now that the machine's internal operating system isfinally in place and color on its way.andP;  &quot;1990 is going to be a very good yearfor us,&quot; he proclaimed in a recent interview.andP;  Market-watchers say it betterbe because so far NeXT has enjoyed far more press than sales.andM;CHECK BACK, MATE...The world's computer chess champion was no opponent forthe world's human chess champion, or so said human champ Gary Kasparov lastOctober after beating Carnegie Mellon's Deep Thought in a two-game match.andO;When told that DT creators hope to develop a machine by 1995 that can scan abillion chess positions a second, Kasparov said that meant he could hold ontothe championship for another five years.andP;  &quot;I can't visualize living with theknowledge that a computer is stronger than the human mind,&quot; he contends.andP;  &quot;Ihad to challenge (the computer) to protect the human race.&quot;andM;CRIME FILE...Those Friday-the-13th viruses may have wimped out, but computercrime is going strong.andP;  Within a six-week period came reports of a14-year-old Californian who used a $200 home computer to break intoCitibank's New York credit accounts and buy $11,000 worth of mail-ordergoods; a 15-year-old New Yorker who broke into Grumman Aviation's computersystem and copied government files on his basement PC for a month beforegetting caught; and of five people arrested and charged with conspiring tosell $90,000 worth of U.S.andP;  computer equipment to Moscow.andP;  Moreover, a rogueprogram in NASA's Space Physics Analysis Network sent out vulgar messages tosome of its users; and a sex game was discovered in the $1.8 million computersystem that controls New York City's fleet of 350 ambulances.andM;ARMY FUNDS CENTER...The University of Minnesota leads a consortium that won a$66.9 million pact to run the Army High-Performance Computing Research Center(AHPCRC).andP;  The contract calls for $27.3 million to be spent on hardware forthe center where research in computer science, engineering, chemistry, andcomputational mathematics will be conducted.andP;  Purdue University, HowardUniversity, Jackson State University, and the Computer Science Corporationare the other members of the consortium.andM;SHIP COMES IN...Sunken treasures once considered lost to the darkness of thedeep are now within reach thanks to such tools as computer imaging, sonar androbot retrievers.andP;  These technologies were used by the team that recentlydiscovered the lost treasures and artifacts from the nation's richestshipwreck.andP;  The booty onboard the SS Central America, which sunk off SouthCarolina in an 1857 hurricane, is estimated at $1 billion.andM;SOARING SALES...Annual shipments of mini-supercomputers should grow by 25percent annually, from $1.2 billion to $2.985 billion, according to a reportissued by Electronic Trend Publications of Saratoga, Calif.andP;  General purposeworkstations should be the second growth leader, increasing in shipment valueby 20 percent, from $3.3 billion to $6.8 billion.andP;  Mainframe shipments,however, are expected to grow at a conservative rate of 5 percent.andM;MORSEL MALADIES...A $99 software package allows users to determine if theyare what they eat.andP;  The WellAware Food Sensitivity program, from Positech inMonterey, Calif., uses pattern recognition methods to trace food allergy andintolerance symptoms to the foods that trigger them.andM;HONORING EDUCATORS...The Robinson Award has been created by IBM to recognizeadvances in the use of information technology to improve teaching andlearning.andP;  Named after the late IBM executive Louis Robinson, best known forhis efforts in educating the general public about computers, the award willoffer winners $25,000 in cash and $25,000 in IBM equipment.andP;  Academics,administrators, colleges and universities are eligible to compete for theaward which will be presented annually at the EDUCOM fall conference for thenext four years beginning in 1990.andP;  In addition, up to three recognitionawards will be presented each year, and will consist of $10,000 in cash and$10,000 in IBM equipment and software.andM;AI EXPERTS IN SHORT SUPPLY...Companies are intensifying their search forexperienced software professionals who can design and develop artificialintelligence systems, according to survey results published by Edward PerlinAssociates, a New York-based consulting firm.andP;  To improve this situation,companies are now willing to pay starting salaries in the mid to high$30,000s for college graduates with some AI experience.andP;  Corporate demand forAI skills is expected to grow 25 percent per year throughout the decade.andM;THANKS, BUT NO THANKS...Twenty years ago, forecasters were envisioning U.S.andO;households by the end of the 1980s filled with such futuristic devices asautomatic bed-making machines, lawn-cutting robots and garbage-vaporizinglasers.andP;  Now a collection of 1960s predictions gone awry has been compiled ina study entitled Leading Technologies that Led Nowhere by Steven P. Schnaars.andO;Another example of off-the-mark forecasting is the annual $5 billion ATandamp;Thoped to be earning by now from its Picturephone.andP;  Price (and the potentialof being broadcast coming out of the shower) killed that project.andP;  &quot;Peoplewon't rearrange their life style just to use a product,&quot; says Schnaars, amanagement science professor at New York's Baruch College.andP;  &quot;Innovations mustoffer real added benefits to potential customers if they are to succeed.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
