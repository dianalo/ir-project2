The Nikkei stock average skyrocketed 906.42 points to 23942.94, surpassing the previous single-day rise, set on April 14, 1986, when it rose 604.54 points.    Saturday, the Nikkei average edged up 21.97 to 23964.91 in the half-day session.    Analysts and investors described Friday's jump as a technical rebound. The Nikkei average lost more than 1300 points between July 17 and last Wednesday. Generally, the market has been on a downward trend for the past five weeks.    &quot;There was nothing more to sell off,&quot; said Shoichi Imai, a general manager of S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc.    This sort of volatility is expected to continue, analysts said. &quot;There's still plenty of concern over the direction of the market,&quot; said William Sterling, an economist at Merrill Lynch Japan.    Last week, investors worried that one of the longest bull markets was coming to an end because of fundamental changes in the economy. The triple benefits of cheap oil, low interest rates and a strong yen that had supported the market appeared to be reversing. As a result, the Nikkei average fell 654.81 yen last Monday, the third-largest drop ever.    But by the end of the week, investors felt their concerns may have been exaggerated, analysts said. Fears of higher oil prices were diminished by the safe passage of newly flagged Kuwaiti ships in the Persian Gulf. Oil prices, in fact, tumbled in the past few sessions. In addition, the yen rose against the dollar.    &quot;Things are being overdone on both sides. As a result we're getting spectacular movements in the market,&quot; said Peter Tasker, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson International Inc.    Investors came back to the market on Friday. Trading volume was heavier at about 800 million shares, up from 400 to 500 million shares in the past few weeks. Volume during Saturday's half-day session was also relatively strong, as 450 million shares changed hands.    Once there were a few buyers, &quot;it became a case of not wanting to miss the train,&quot; Mr. Tasker said.    Earlier last week, the Tokyo Stock Exchange relaxed margin collateral requirements, but analysts said it is too soon to tell when the change will affect the market.    Friday's buying interest was also spurred, traders and analysts said, by rumors that the Ministry of Finance had called on the major brokerage firms to liven up the market. Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage, along with large investment trust companies, were reportedly big buyers of heavy chemical, pharmaceutical and domestic demand-related shares.    &quot;One can't ignore the fact that there has been a concerted buying program the last couple of days&quot; by Japan's major brokerage firms, Mr. Tasker said.    A report Friday morning in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the leading daily economic newspaper, that Japanese investment in foreign securities slowed significantly in July may also have contributed to bullish sentiment, analysts said. During the first 20 days of July, Japanese bought an estimated $5 billion of foreign securities, compared with $14.1 billion in June.    &quot;We have a lot of money piling up,&quot; said Toshio Hirakawa, a fund manager at Nippon Life Insurance.    But after a week like this last one, Mr. Hirakawa said, &quot;You can bet that after the market closed, everybody held meetings to study the scene more closely.&quot;    London Stocks   Stock prices in London rebounded Friday from a five-session decline that saw the 100-share index fall 103.2 points, or 4.2%.    On Friday, the 100-share index moved up 6.7 points to 2346.9. The Financial Times 30-share index was up 8.9 at 1845.0. Volume rose to 874.1 million shares from 767.1 million shares Thursday.    Lloyds Bank, which said it was adding #1.07 billion ($1.72 billion) to its loan-loss provisions, reported a pre-tax loss of #697 million for the first half, compared with profit of #335 million a year earlier. Lloyds fell one pence to 409 pence ($6.56).    Most oil issues fell amid declines in crude oil prices. Shell Transport andamp; Trading was down 19 pence at #14.55, British Petroleum was off four pence at 376 pence and Britoil fell two pence to 311 pence.    British Gas partly paid shares rose four pence to 186 pence.    Gold issues were lower following recent sharp gains. RTZ was off three pence at #12.69, and Consolidated Gold Fields was down 14 pence at #12.84.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                       % This                                   Jul 23    Jul 22    Year   U.S. .......................... 286.4     286.9   + 25.6   Britain ....................... 701.5     703.4   + 41.0   Canada ........................ 439.1     438.3   + 31.8   Japan ........................ 1134.5    1112.4   + 20.1   France ........................ 418.3     414.7   +  2.5   Germany ....................... 237.9     240.4   -  8.4   Hong Kong .................... 2398.3    2402.6   + 34.8   Switzerland ................... 202.7     201.7   -  0.9   Australia ..................... 370.2     365.8   + 40.3   World index ................... 450.5     447.0   + 26.3</TEXT></DOC>
