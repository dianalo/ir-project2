Another big drop in the stock market helped ignite a rally in the bond market, now a major refuge for worried equity investors. Despite relatively strong corporate earnings this year, the stock market debacle this week has prompted growing fear of a recession next year, a situation that would favor Treasury bonds as investments.    &quot;The amount of business we're seeing is huge,&quot; said Daniel J. Calahan, manager of the government bond department at First Boston Corp. &quot;People are buying Treasury securities for comfort and also because they expect easy monetary policy in the weeks ahead.&quot;    Prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds surged nearly 3 5/8 points, or almost $36.25 for each $1,000 face amount. Since last Thursday, the benchmark issue has climbed about 12 points as its yield has fallen to about 9.1% from a high of about 10.45%. Rates on six-month Treasury bills also fell about 0.3 percentage point as Citibank and most other commercial banks cut their prime rates a quarter of a percentage point to 9% from 9 1/4%.    The decline in both long-term and short-term borrowing costs prompted corporations, including Borden Inc., Dow Jones andamp; Co. and Mobil Corp., to issue about $1.6 billion of new debt securities.    Yesterday also was the first time banks cut their prime rates since August of last year, when they were widely reduced to 7.5% from 8%. Since then, the prime was raised five times, most recently Oct. 8. Three banks boosted the lending fee as high as 9 3/4% this month, but promptly reduced the rate to 9 1/4% in the wake of Monday's stock market crash.    Pressure for lower rates has mounted not only in the U.S. the past week, but also in Canada, Europe and Japan, where stock markets plummeted as investors rushed to bail out of their equity holdings.    Bank of Montreal lowered its minimum lending rate one percentage point to 9 1/2% effective today, while Canada's other major banks lowered their prime rates three-quarters of a percentage point to 9 3/4%.    The lower rates were triggered by a decline in the Bank of Canada's weekly bank rate to 8.26% from 9.83%. Bank of Canada is the country's central bank.    &quot;I'm convinced the (U.S.) banks are responding to very strong official action to stabilize financial markets in the U.S., Japan and Europe,&quot; said Francis Schott, chief economist at the Equitable Assurance Society. &quot;The prime cuts occurred almost certainly as a result of talks between Federal Reserve officials and those of the leading commercial banks,&quot; he added, concluding that banks &quot;were told their costs of funds won't rise anytime soon. The Fed will want to be certain that the economy isn't sinking into recession.&quot;    Yesterday, for example, the Fed injected reserves into the banking system well before its normally scheduled market intervention period. Analysts cited the Fed's action as another indication that it is making credit plentiful to calm the turbulent equity market.    Nevertheless, many economists contend that the bond market rally could sputter in the months ahead. &quot;It's premature to say the bear market in bonds is over on the presumption that the stock market crash will put us into a recession and the administration would allow that to happen in an election year,&quot; said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Whatever the case, the credit markets still could be buffeted by huge trade and budget deficits in the months ahead as well as fear of a weaker dollar. &quot;Nothing's changed -- we still have the deficits and all the other problems,&quot; said Kenneth A. Wineheim, director of international fixed-income investments at Prudential Capital Management International.    &quot;People are grasping to explain what's happening, but you can't,&quot; added Mr. Wineheim. &quot;We've had an entire interest rate cycle in three days and that isn't really comforting. All the credibility that (former Fed chairman) Paul Volcker built up the past eight years, Alan Greenspan has destroyed in two months. The financial markets are acting irrationally.&quot;    Yesterday, Frederick W. Zuckerman, vice president and treasurer at Chrysler Corp., said 30% of Chrysler's $3.6 billion pension fund is in cash or equivalent short-term securities, and &quot;it could go up to 40%.&quot;    Mr. Zuckerman blamed part of the financial crisis on the Reagan administration and its inability to reduce the huge budget and trade deficits. In the months ahead, he expects both the stock and bond markets to erode as foreign investors lose confidence in the U.S. He expects the dollar to decline significantly, ultimately driving up U.S. interest rates.    &quot;I don't feel good at all,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm really bearish on both the bond and stock bond markets. The President doesn't have the vaguest idea what's happening. It's so reminiscent of 1929, when (President Herbert) Hoover and (Treasury Secretary) Mellon said everything is okay.&quot;    Instead, the Chrysler executive said the U.S. is &quot;finally paying the piper for seven years of profligacy by this administration. I do not believe the present reduction in interest rates is real because I don't believe the administration is determined to reduce the deficits,&quot; he said.    &quot;Obviously right now money is coming from the stock market into the bond market,&quot; Mr. Zuckerman said. &quot;While it may continue for a couple of weeks, we'll see higher rates again. We haven't seen the highs in the rates yet. The Federal Reserve in its desire to prevent a problem of rising rates will be unable to avoid higher rates,&quot; because foreign investors will demand them for holding a weaker currency.    &quot;One of these days,&quot; he predicted, Japanese investors, who have helped finance U.S. deficits with huge purchases of U.S. bonds, &quot;won't come to our bond auctions.&quot;    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds, which Tuesday jumped 46.44 points in its biggest one-day advance since it was started at the end of 1980, climbed again yesterday. The index rose 32.56 points to 1235.11. It ranged between 1205.48 and 1235.50.    Among actively traded issues, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 were quoted late yesterday at a price of 97 3/4, up from 94 6/32 late Wednesday, and 87 14/32 late last Thursday. The yield fell to 9.09% from 9.46%. The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 climbed yesterday to 98 from 95 1/2 Wednesday, as the yield fell to 8.93% from 9.33%.    The Treasury yesterday sold $9.26 billion of 52-week bills at an average annual yield of 6.45%. That was down from 7.32% at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 30 and the lowest since 6.22% July 2.    The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bills declined to 5.30% bid from 5.59% bid Wednesday and an average of 6.84% set at Monday's auction. The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bills fell to 6% bid from 6.25% bid Wednesday and 6.20% bid Tuesday. Among other short-term rates, federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, rose to an average rate of 7.14% from 6.47% Wednesday, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.)A). Many analysts said the higher funds rates didn't signal any change in the Fed's easier credit stance.    In the market for junk bonds, or non-investment grade securities yesterday, prices fell as the stock market declined. Despite the junk market's recent turbulence, SCI Television Inc. sold $400 million of high-yield securities, including a portion with a 17.5% yield to maturity in 1999. Underwriters at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. handled the sale.    Underwriters said the bond market rally help buoy a huge slate of new offerings in the corporate sector. Among the largest:    --A $250 million issue of Ford Motor Credit Co. notes due November 1990. Underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. priced the notes at par to yield 8.9%, or 0.78 percentage point more than the rate on the Treasury's three-year note. The issue is rated double-A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    --A $200 million issue of Mobil notes due November 1990. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets priced the 8 3/4% notes at 99.922 to yield 8.78%, or 0.7 percentage point more than the Treasury's three-year note. The issue is rated double-A-3 by Moody's and double-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    --A $200 million issue of Federated Department Stores Inc. notes due November 1992. Underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. priced the notes at par to yield 9.375%, or 0.85 percentage point more than the Treasury's five-year note.

Underwriters led by First Boston Corp. priced the 9 7/8% notes at 99.717 to yield 9.92%, or 0.85 percentage point more than the Treasury's 10-year note. The issue is rated double-A-3 by Moody's and double-A-plus by Sandamp;P.    --A $125 million million issue of Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania auction-rate debentures with a final maturity of January 1998. Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. priced the debentures at par to yield 9%, or 0.9 percentage point more than the Treasury's three-year notes. The initial rate on the securities lasts until January 1991. The issue is rated double-A-1 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of Republic National Bank of New York notes due October 1989. Underwriters led E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. priced the 8.4% notes at 99.963 to yield 8.417%, or 0.65 percentage point more than the Treasury's two-year note. The issue is rated double-A-1 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of Consolidated Natural Gas Co. debentures due October 1992. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. priced the debentures at par to yield 9.125%, or 0.625 percentage point more than the Treasury's five-year note. The issue is rated double-A-2 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P.    --A $100 million issue of Dow Jones notes due November 1992. Underwriters led by Goldman Sachs priced the 9 1/4% notes at 99 7/8 to yield 9.28%, or 0.7 percentage point more than the Treasury's five-year note. The issue is rated double-A-2 by Moody's and double-A by Sandamp;P. The issue is the first public debt sale by Dow Jones.    Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 52-week bills.    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                         52-Week    Applications                    $21,946,575,000    Accepted bids                    $9,257,955,000    Accepted at low price                       83%    Accepted noncompetitively          $268,110,000    Average price (Rate)               93.478(6.45%)    High price (Rate)                  93.529(6.40%)    Low price (Rate)                   93.448(6.48%)    Coupon equivalent                          6.9%   The bills are dated Oct. 29 and mature Oct. 27, 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
