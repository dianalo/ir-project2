A theoretical pointsource study for an ideal response detector has shown, for objects whichare close enough to the origin of the reconstructed area, that thereare significant differences between sections obtained by different samplingmethods. A computer simulation study of line sources in a homogeneousattenuated medium has confirmed the results of clinical studies in whichsignificant image distortion has been observed in 180/sup 0/ sectionsbut not in 360/sup 0/ reconstructed images.</TEXT></DOC>
