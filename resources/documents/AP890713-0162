G.V.``Sonny'' Montgomery.   ``If we don't do something, I fear Americans, and especiallyveterans' groups, are going to stop the desecration of the flag intheir own way and people are going to get hurt,'' he said.   Montgomery is co-sponsor with House GOP Leader Bob Michel of anamendment endorsed by President Bush to overcome last month's 5-4decision by the court. The justices said burning the flag was aconstitutionally protected form of political dissent.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, a liberal Democrat from Ohio, took strongissue with those supporting a constitutional amendment.   ``No amendment in our history has restricted individualfreedom,'' he said. ``This is not the time to break faith with twocenturies of tradition.''   Metzenbaum said the court ruling had triggered ``a crude form ofpolitical one-upmanship, a crass competition about who loves theflag more ... shameful and crass demagoguery, all with a cold eyetoward the next election.''   Many politicians have been scrambling to embrace the flag issuesince the court's ruling.   Bush quickly called for a constitutional amendment to overturnthe ruling, but leading congressional Democrats have been pushinginstead for a law that would address the issue without altering theConstitution.   The argument played out Thursday at a hearing by the HouseConstitutional Law Subcommittee, the opening shot in Congress overwhat is sure to be an extended debate.   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate JudiciaryCommittee, urged the House panel to approve legislation like his ownbill, which could take effect almost immediately. A constitutionalamendment would require approval by the states after Congress acted.   But supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment said theydoubted anything short of that would succeed.   ``We believe there is no quick legislative fix,'' said Michel.   Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House Veterans AffairsCommittee, said the subcommittee should swiftly approve theamendment instead of tinkering with legal nuance which might stilloffend the court.   But subcommittee chairman Don Edwards, D-Calif., urged hiscolleagues to be cautious.   ``The flag is sturdy, flying proudly through every fierce battleof every war and through times of social upheaval,'' he said. ``TheConstitution, however, is fragile and can be amended by the votes oflegislators caught up in the emotional whirlwinds of the moment.''   Edwards told reporters after the hearing that he believed morelawmakers were becoming leery of a constitutional amendment.Opponents of an amendment hope that by swiftly passing legislationon flag burning, perhaps by the August recess, they can further coolthe fervor for an amendment.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he and otherlawmakers were finding their constituents were opposed to flagburning but also concerned about a constitutional amendment.   ``I find it encouraging, because it seems to me that people arecalmly looking at the question of whether the Constitution should beamended, and I am glad that it is being examined with that calm,''Foley said.   Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, ranking Republican on thesubcommittee, said he would fight attempts in Congress to``obfuscate the issues with legal mumble-jumble.'' Lawmakers shouldrespond to the will of the people, he said, distributing a MilwaukeeJournal article with a poll saying 75 percent of those surveyed inhis state favor an amendment.   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said the issue might be morecomplicated than it appears at first glance.   She held up for the television cameras various uses of the flagwhich might or might not be construed a desecration. She included apicture of herself wrapped in the flag which appeared on the coverof Ms. Magazine, and one of Barbara Bush wearing a flag around herneck.   ``I really wonder how we know which of these are desecrations andwhich aren't,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
