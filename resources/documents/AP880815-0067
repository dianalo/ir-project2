Soldiers sealed off the entire Gaza Strip with an indefinitecurfew, barring visitors and journalists for the third time sincethe Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8.   The move followed clashes in Gaza on Sunday in which the armysaid its soldiers shot and wounded 12 Palestinians. Arab reportsput the figure at 25 wounded.   Also Sunday, a firebomb hurled at a car traveling to a Jewishsettlement injured six Israelis, including an 8-month-old burned onthe face and arms.   Witnesses said soldiers went door-to-door in some areas of GazaCity, ordering residents to go out and paint over slogans on walls,take down Palestinian flags and clean up debris from demonstrations.   Some slogans said: ``Strike and Confrontation,'' ``We Will NeverKneel Before the Zionists'' and ``Deportations and Arrests WillNever Scare Us.''   Journalists were stopped by soldiers at the Erez checkpointleading into the Gaza Strip. Army officers said knots of protestersset burning tires along the road from the checkpoint to Gaza City.   As a result of the curfew, the 50,000 Arab workers from the GazaStrip were unable to go to their jobs in Israel.   Arab reporters and hospital officials said Jamal Odeh, 21, wasshot through the heart today after nightlong demonstrations at theTulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank, where youths set uproadblocks and burned tires.   His death brought to 244 the number of Palestinians killed inthe 8-month-old uprising against 21 years of Israeli occupaiton.Four Israelis have also died.   Palestinians attributed the outbreak in Gaza to the burningdeaths of two Arab workers near Tel Aviv. Police said Jewishextremists may have torched a hut where three Arab builders sleptnear a construction site.   No one has been arrested.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, speaking on Israel radio,attributed the sudden upsurge of violence to a show of strength byMoslem fundamentalists who had called for demonstrations to markthe start of the new Islamic year 1409.   Rabin said Israeli authorities adopted a new stategy to chokeoff the violence, uprooting village and neighborhood Palestiniancommittees which have sought to run community affairs andcoordinate anti-Israeli activities.   He also said the army had been ordered to ``shoot to hit''firebomb-throwers and ``if one is caught, to demolish his homewithout granting him right of apppeal.''   Palestinian leaders protested the Israeli clampdown thatconfined the entire Gaza population to their homes as an attempt to``terrorize'' civilians.   ``What the Israelis are doing is really inhuman, and they keepdoing it despite all the protests from all over the world. It seemsthat Israel translates the protests into a `Keep going' message,''said Dr. Hayder Abdul Shafi, head of the Red Crescent (Red Cross)in the Gaza Strip.   Jewish settlers called on the government to take toughermeasures after the firebomb attack, in which four Israeli childrenand two adults were burned while en route to the Neve Dekalimsettlement.   ``The army met with us and conveyed they would take a series ofsevere decisions ... uprooting orchards, destroying houses,deporting whoever did it,'' said Menachem Beit-Halachmi, aspokesman for the Jewish settlement movement in the Gaza Strip.   ``With that report, we were able to ask our people not to go outto the area themselves,'' he said, referring to the settlers'threat to take vigilante action.   Israeli officials, meanwhile, gave a mixed reacton to statementsby Salah Khalaf, the No. 2 man in Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction.   He told the weekly French magazine Journal du Dimanche that thePLO was considering forming a provisional government that woulddrop its demand for the elimination of the state of Israel.   A Foreign Ministry spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymitysaid officials would ``study attentively'' the text of theinterview which officials expected to receive later in the day.   Privately, sources close to Israel's liberal foreign minister,Shimon Peres, said they welcomed the debate among Palestinians.   ``It's a positive thing when people talk politics instead ofwar,'' said a source who demanded anonymity.   However, Yossi Ahimier, a spokesman for right-wing PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir, noted the firebomb attack on Israelicivilians in Gaza and said ``we have to watch what they do not whatthey say.''   He said Khalaf's proposal was a tactical move and was not basedon a sincere desire for coexistence.</TEXT></DOC>
