Barrett   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/09/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B6</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><GV>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- To his policeman's hat and bureaucrat'sgreen eye shade, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has addedthe diplomat's black bowler.   In the coming issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, Mr.Thornburgh holds forth on &quot;The Soviet Union and the Rule ofLaw.&quot; The article is replete with allusions to his personalmission last year to Moscow, where he preached to Sovietleaders about the values of the U.S. legal system. Infrequent speeches, the attorney general contends thatWashington has an obligation to export our legal principlesto fertilize democracy movements in the East.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Anything that we can do to expostulate upon our ownexperience, and to share with . . . the framers . . . ofthese nascent constitutions, I think will be in our long-terminterest,&quot; he told a meeting of the Federalist Society, aconservative legal group based here.   Beyond proselytizing, Mr. Thornburgh has dedicated himselfto a number of foreign-policy projects that are unusual inscope and variety for an attorney general to undertake. Hehas helped orchestrate Senate approval of treaties tofacilitate cooperative law enforcement efforts with othercountries. He has visited numerous foreign counterparts toapply personal pressure in attempts to ease foreign-banksecrecy and extradition rules. And at home, he is supervisinga rethinking of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's foreigncounterintelligence strategies in light of the opening ofrelations with previously hostile East European nations.   Mr. Thornburgh's efforts add up to &quot;building theinfrastructure for international law enforcement,&quot; says histop aide, Robert Ross. Translated from the bureaucratese,that means scrambling to keep up with high-tech criminals whoare no longer limited by national borders and who cantransfer ill-gotten gains from one bank account to anotherjust by punching a computer key.   Some observers are impressed by the attorneygeneral-turned-diplomat. &quot;I'd give him a good grade,&quot; saysBarry Carter, an international law professor at GeorgetownUniversity and a Democrat. &quot;He clearly surpasses {Reaganadministration Attorney General Edwin} Meese, who took a lotof junkets but really didn't distinguish himself in thisarea.&quot;   Mr. Carter has one main concern: the Thornburgh JusticeDepartment's determination that the FBI can snatch U.S.fugitives in foreign countries without getting the hostgovernment's permission. &quot;If we were to act unilaterally inthat fashion, we could undermine a lot of cooperation,&quot; saysthe professor.   Others are suspicious of Mr. Thornburgh's motives, notinghis much-discussed ambition for higher office. Referring tothe attorney general's busy schedule of international travel,Jack Blum, an international lawyer and former special counselto the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says, &quot;It makeshim look like a vice presidential candidate.&quot;   Mr. Blum's former boss, Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.),praises the Bush administration's anti-drug diplomacy, but heargues that some Justice Department projects abroad areill-advised. He points to Operation Snowcap, in which armedU.S. agents are leading paramilitary helicopter squads todestroy cocaine facilities in the Peruvian and Bolivianjungles.   &quot;This has the makings of another Vietnam,&quot; says thelawmaker. &quot;You leave a lot of people hanging out there andtaking a lot of risks without the resources or the strategyto win.&quot;   There is, however, widespread agreement that somecountries are cooperating more with U.S. law enforcement, atleast in part because of Mr. Thornburgh's internationaloffensive. His pressure helped prompt Swiss authorities tohonor their earlier treaty agreements and open previouslysecret bank accounts where international drug dealers stashtheir profits.   The attorney general also played a role in convincing theColombian government to begin extraditing people facing U.S.drug charges. After years of inaction from Bogota, 15 membersof Colombian cocaine trafficking organizations have beenextradited since last summer.   Critics point out that these defendants aren't Colombia'stop drug lords and therefore are easily replaced by thecartel heads. But Mark Richard, a senior career official inthe Justice Department's criminal division, contends that&quot;even the level of success we've had breaks the pattern ofrhetoric with little action.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
