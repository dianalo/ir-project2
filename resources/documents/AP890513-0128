(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rutgers University students protestedtuition increases Saturday as incoming freshmen toured the campus,but there was no repeat of the violence that resulted in 71 arreststhe day before.   About 50 students demonstrated as six police officers onhorseback and at least a dozen on foot kept watch.   The protest focused on police treatment of demonstrators Fridayas well as the 13 percent tuition hike for undergraduates andincreases of up to 18 percent for graduate students approved thesame day.   Televisions were set up on the main green to show a homemadevideotape of police slapping students with nightsticks and carryingothers away by the hair when the students refused to leave the deanof students' office.   ``Rutgers University created a riot, and now they're trying toplay it down,'' said Jay Glick, a 20-year-old sophomore from EastBrunswick. ``We were just trying to be heard. If we can't speak up,who's going to hear us?''   Associate Dean of Students Dwight Smith blamed the violence onthe students, saying they broke the state university's regulations.   Smith said he saw someone jump a detective Friday. ``That's theonly violence I saw,'' he said.   Stu Heiser, a 22-year-old junior from Morristown and a member ofthe student government, said the latest protest was aimed at theincoming freshmen touring the campus and their parents.   ``Had some of these students known of the tuition increase, theymay not have decided to come here,'' Heiser said.   Under tuition increases approved Friday by the Rutgers Board ofGovernors and going into effect this fall, undergraduate studentswho are New Jersey residents will pay $2,576 a year and mostgraduate students will pay $3,668.</TEXT></DOC>
