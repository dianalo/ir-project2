The IMF said its financial assistance will be disbursed in six separate loans over three years.    Malawi was the first country to qualify for loans from the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, which is to be financed through contributions and loans from richer nations.    Loans from the facility go to the poorest developing countries that belong to the IMF. They carry an annual interest rate of only 0.5% and are repayable over 10 years. </TEXT></DOC>
