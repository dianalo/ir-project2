DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former President Reagan and his wife, Nancy,settling with apparent ease into their new life at 668 Saint CloudRoad, returned to an unusual standing ovation Sunday at the churchwhere they worshiped before entering the White House.   ``God ... has answered our prayers for you and for Mrs. Reaganand I want you to know we are very pleased to welcome you back, andthank God for what you were able to do for your country in theselast eight years,'' the Rev. Donn Moomaw of Bel Air PresbyterianChurch told Reagan.   The congregation, disregarding a precautionary note in the churchbulletin against applauding during the service, stood and gave theReagans a prolonged round of hand-clapping.   ``We probably won't be doing that every Sunday you come,'' Moomawsaid.   The Reagans, seated near the back of the hilltop church, latertook part in the Presbyterian communion service, in which wafers andgrape juice are brought to the worshipers at their seats, and joinedin the singing of ``Amazing Grace.''   Moomaw preached on a text from Ephesians 2 reading, in thetranslation he used, ``It is by grace that you have been savedthrough faith and not from yourselves; it is the gift of God, not byworks, so that no one can boast.''   Well-wishers lined a rope line outside the church as the Reagansentered and left the church. People said, ``Nice to have you back''and ``Welcome home'' and ``He looks so good.''   The Reagans were greeted on arrival by Frank McDougall, a deaconand 20-year member of the church who oversees parking, and by CarlVann, the head usher, with a white carnation in his lapel.   The Reagans moved here Friday from the White House after hecompleted an eight-year assignment in Washington as president of theUnited States.   Clusters of red, white and blue balloons and a ```Welcome Ron andNancy'' sign remained up at one nearby house over the weekend, butotherwise the Reagans' new street looked like your averageneighborhood of multi-million dollar residences.   ``Will he make a change?'' Jeffrey Hyland, a real estateexecutive who lives near the Reagans, repeated the question tohimself before answering. ``Maybe for a couple of weeks,'' he said.``After that I think everything will be back to normal.''   Small knots of tourists gathered along the narrow winding streetfrom time to time over the weekend, hoping to catch a glimpse of theformer president and first lady.   The Reagans' son, Ron, drove up in a red sports car and visitedfor about half an hour. While he was there, he and his parentsappeared on a walkway that is visible from the road and waved.   Occasionally, tour vans stopped in front of the Reagans' place _a new stop on an established route that includes the homes ofneighbors Zsa Zsa Gabor and Elizabeth Taylor.   Flowers were delivered for Mrs. Reagan. A Secret Service man cameoutside the walls for a moment.   But the elaborate security that was in effect when Reagan visitedhere as president over the Christmas and New Year's holidays wasgone. No longer was the street blocked off at both ends and securitycars parked along its length.   The Reagans continue to receive around-the-clock Secret Serviceprotection.   ``We won't give you the specifics of what they are going to get,how much,'' said Secret Service spokesman Rich Adams in Washington.``It would really be kind of self-defeating for us to do that.''   Hyland, the new neighbor, estimated security had been scaled backby 80 percent.   The Reagans will continue to be driven by the Secret Service.There was a 10-car caravan when they arrived Friday after the flightfrom Washington.   ``They come and go and are in and out of the driveway in 10seconds and down the street,'' said Hyland. ``I don't think it'sgoing to be much of a problem.''   Like all the streets in the fashionable hillside neighborhoodcalled Bel-Air, Saint Cloud has no sidewalks _ apparently part of aneffort to protect its exclusivity when it was first laid out as ahaven for blue bloods in the 1920s.   In a television interview broadcast on the CBS program ``60Minutes'' on Jan. l5, Mrs. Reagan, looking ahead to life after theWhite House, said not being on the front pages would be ``fine withme.''   ``I will not miss being under the microscope,'' Mrs. Reagan said.   Indeed, attention is already shifting to President Bush and hiswife Barbara as they get settled in at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue andaway from the Reagans as they get settled in on Saint Cloud Road.   ``We have our share of rubberneckers, but we have always hadthem,'' said Hyland. ``The novelty, I think, is going to veryquickly wear off.''   As for the Reagans, they said during the flight from Washingtonthat they still have unpacking to do.   ``Up to now, I've been doing that,'' the former first lady toldreporters. Asked whether the president was good at unpacking, shejust laughed.</TEXT></DOC>
