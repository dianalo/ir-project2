A similar clastic sequence is seen below the carbonatesof the Bahamas platform. In the Pinar del Rio area, the San Cayetanois succeeded by Oxfordian limestones, the shallow water Jagua Fm. tothe south and deeper water Francisco Fm. to the north. Both contain basalticpillow lavas, related either to rifting or to leaky transform motionparallel to the margin. The Oxfordian units are overlain by Kimmeridgianto Tithonian pelagic limestones, the Guasasa and Artemisa Fms. The laterinterfingers with northerly derived calci-turbidites. North of the Escambray,silici-clastic fragments in late Jurassic pelagic limestones suggeststhat a basement high existed south of the platform until the Berriasian.The carbonate platform continues to shed debris along its southern edgethroughout the Cretaceous. To the south an Aptian-Albian episode of turbiditedeposition suggests that South America-Africa rifting caused tectonicdisturbances in the Caribbean. Southerly derived volcanoclastics depositedduring the Maastrichtian marks the start of the Cuban orogeny.</TEXT></DOC>
