The officials say there is insufficient money and trainedmanpower to meet this October's asbestos-inspection deadline, setin 1986 by a Congress upset with the slow pace of the battleagainst the deadly substance.   But groups representing teachers, parents and school employeesare opposing a deadline extension, arguing that such a step isunwarranted and would prolong long-term health threats faced bymillions of schoolchildren.   So far, the Reagan administration is staying officially neutralin a growing debate that finds both sides saying their main concernis the safety of children attending an estimated 31,000 publicschools believed to contain asbestos.   Once a common building material, asbestos is dangerous when itbecomes friable, or crumbly. Friable asbestos releases the fibersthat can cause a variety of respiratory ailments, including lungcancer. The fibers pose more threat to a child's lungs than to anadult's.   In 1986, Congress ended a struggle with the administration bypassing legislation requiring school districts to inspect forfriable asbestos and to render it harmless, either by removing itor stabilizing it.   The law was a response to hit-and-miss abatement efforts by theEnvironmental Protection Agency, which in the 1970s began avoluntary program against asbestos in schools.   In 1982, the EPA issued a regulation requiring every schooldistrict to inspect for the substance by January 1984 and to notifyschool employees and parents if friable asbestos were found.   There was no requirement that any other action be taken. Sixmonths after the deadline, only 11 percent of the districts hadcomplied completely with the regulation, which had been broadlyattacked as too weak.   Even worse, the EPA itself acknowledged that where schooldistricts took action against friable asbestos, much of the removalwork was performed by unqualified ``rip-and-skip'' contractors whofilled the air with fibers.   Under the 1986 law, school districts have until this October tocarry out a new round of inspections and prepare plans to abatefriable asbestos and until July 1989 to begin carrying out thoseplans.   ``Many local public school districts are incapable ofcompliance,'' a hearing by two Senate Environment subcommittees wastold recently by Robert Anderson, representing the National SchoolBoards Association.   The association, joined by groups like the American Associationof School Administrators and the Council for American PrivateEducation, has written lawmakers asking for a deadline extension.   Their argument is that because the EPA didn't issue regulationsimplementing the 1986 law until last October, there is insufficienttime to comply.   First, they say, there aren't enough trained people to inspectschools and draft abatement plans. The 1986 law limits this work topeople certified as qualified by the EPA, which set forth trainingrequirements in last year's regulation.   The school officials also say there is a shortage of accreditedlaboratories to test the asbestos samples; some states haven't hada chance to repeal anti-asbestos laws that conflict with thefederal law; and some districts lack inspection and abatement funds.   John Moore, head of EPA's office of pesticide and toxicsubstances, said training courses are turning out 2,000 certifiedasbestos inspectors a month and that there should be enough to meetthe October deadline, although there could be shortages in somestates.   Moore told the hearing that while the administration has noposition on the deadline question, his personal view is that anextension ``should not be done lightly.''   Pressed by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., about the prospectsfor compliance with the 1986 law, Moore said: ``I think the vastmajority of school districts can meet the deadline.''   Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, and nearly 100 House colleagues aresponsoring a bill to push the deadlines back a year.   Oxley says one problem is that school districts are gettingwidely different bids from contractors to perform inspections anddraft plans. Lima, Ohio, got bids ranging from about $63,000 toover $142,000 for its 17 school buildings, according to Oxley.   ``The possibility that some unscrupulous firms might be takingadvantage of school districts under the gun to meet the deadlineshould not be dismissed lightly,'' Oxley recently told a Househearing.   ``Not only are the tight deadlines forcing some schools to payinflated prices, in some cases the tight deadlines are compromisingthe health of our children by helping cause shoddy inspections andinsufficient management plans,'' Oxley said.   Paul Spell of the Texas Association of School Boards said thatkeeping the current deadlines ``may result in hasty, unsound andinefficient compliance actions that could jeopardize the health andsafety of millions of public school children and school employees.''   These views are not shared by groups representing schoolemployees and the parents and teachers of the children.   ``By extending the deadlines, Congress will be sending a messageto school districts that it is acceptable to continue to ignore ordelay action on this serious health issue,'' says Ann Lynch, firstvice president of the National PTA.   Keith Geiger, vice president of the National EducationAssociation, a teachers' group, says that ``if school boards hadtaken immediate steps to comply with the law ... the overwhelmingmajority would be in a position to complete the inspection and plandevelopment requirements on time.''</TEXT></DOC>
