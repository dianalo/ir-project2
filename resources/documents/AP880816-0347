About half the Bradlees stores, located in the densely populatedcorrider linking Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., willbe remodeled and opened as Hechinger stores, according to companyspokeswoman Pam McMillan. The rest, because they are located closeto existing Hechinger stores, will be rented out to other retailers.   ``Stop and Shop was only willing to sell the leases as apackage,'' McMillan explained. ``But the locations are verylucrative, and a number of retailers have already shown an interestin renting in these locations.''   The agreement did not include the purchase of any inventory,fixtures or other Bradlees assets by Hechinger, said John W.Hechinger and Richard England, co-chairmen of the chain ofdo-it-yourself retail home improvement centers.   Hechinger, which is based just outside the nation's capital, has73 stores operating on the eastern seaboard and will expand byabout 32 percent with the transaction.   ``The growth of the area in terms of number of homes andhousehold income makes it one of the prime markets fordo-it-yourself retailing in the United States,'' England andHechinger said in a statement.   They said the acquisition would be financed out of existingworking capital.   Hechinger reported sales of $725.1 million, up 23 percent, andearnings of $40 million, up 41 percent, in the year ended Jan. 30,1988.   Stop andamp; Shop began to sell some of its stores earlier this yearafter it went private in a $1.23 billion leveraged buyout led bythe investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
