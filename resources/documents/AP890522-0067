Thai officials said 400 to 800 Burmese troops entered northernTak province Saturday and burned a village marketplace. Thai forcesfired artillery at the Burmese soldiers and killed at least six ofthem, Thai officials said.   The Burmese soldiers crossed the border 240 miles north ofBangkok to attack the Kaw Moo Ra rebel camp along the Moei River.   The director-general of the Foreign Ministry's politicaldepartment, Thep Devakul, lodged the protest with BurmeseAmbassador Nyunt Swe, according to government spokesman SuvitYodmanee. Suvit said Thailand demanded compensation for theincursion, but relations with Rangoon remain ``fairly cordial.''   ``We consider it serious as far as Burmese troops coming in andviolating the territorial integrity of Thailand, but it was a veryshort period and they were actually trying to eliminate the Karen''rebels, he said.   In a telephone interview, Nyunt Swe said he told Thep he had nodetails from his government about the incident. He said relationsbetween Bangkok and Rangoon ``are very good.''   In the past, the Thais have given sanctuary to Karen rebels whohave long been trying to overthrow the Burmese government and whomaintain bases along the Burmese-Thai border.
