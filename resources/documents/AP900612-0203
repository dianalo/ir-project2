The 18-1 vote by the Senate Commerce, Science and TransportationCommittee marked the first time lawmakers have moved to restoresome of the regulation of the cable industry that Congress liftedin the 1984 Cable Act.   The 1984 law ended local rate regulation effective in 1987, andsince then members of Congress have been deluged with complaints ofsoaring prices and poor service.   More than 20 re-regulation bills were introduced in Congress inthe past two years, and the Senate communications subcommittee heldnine hearings before the compromise bill emerged.   The bill, among other things, would:   _Allow local governments to regulate prices for a ``basic tier''of channels including local over-the-air broadcast channels.Ad-supported pay cable channels such as ESPN, CNN and MTV would notbe subject to local rate regulation. However, if local authoritiesor a subscriber complains about rate increases for suchad-supported cable channels, the FCC could establish ``reasonablerates'' if it finds them to be excessive.   _Require cable operators not to discriminate against cableprogrammers like movie channels with which they have noaffiliation. Some cable companies are owned by giant conglomeratesthat also own movie channels.   _Require that all cable programmers make their programmingavailable to home dish owners.</TEXT><HEAD>Turner Promises Apology for Religion Remarks</HEAD><DATELINE>WOODSTOCK, Ga.
