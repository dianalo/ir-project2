Purchasing managers surveyed in mid-November by the National Association of Purchasing Management were &quot;extremely optimistic&quot; about the 1988 outlook, said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee. This optimism, he said, is fueled by &quot;significant increases in export business.&quot;    The purchasing managers sounded more optimistic than most economists in several recent surveys. Many economists fear the stock market's collapse on Oct. 19 will make shoppers more cautious, especially on such major purchases as autos and homes. Some also fear the stock market's woes may persuade companies to postpone capital spending plans until a clearer picture of the economy's health emerges. Nevertheless, most economists still contend there is no evidence of a recession coming anytime soon.    The consensus in the association's semiannual survey is that this year's fourth quarter will be better than the third. Also, next year's first half is expected to be even stronger than this year's second half.    The economy's pace is expected to slow in the second half of 1988. Price increases next year will average about 3.6%, up from an estimated 3.2% this year.    The optimism is widespread. The association said 57% predicted 1988 will be better than 1987, while only 13% expected a worse year. That is the highest total to forecast a better future year in December since 1983, when 86% were expecting stronger growth.    But the purchasing managers were considerably more optimistic earlier this year, before the stock market collapsed. &quot;There is some concern&quot; about the business outlook because of the stock market, said Mr. Bretz, who also is director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc.    In the May survey, 57% said they were satisfied or optimistic about the outlook for the next 12 months. In the latest survey, only 42% felt that way.    Some 42% of those surveyed in May said they were &quot;concerned&quot; about the outlook for the next 12 months. Now, 57% feel that way. However, the percentage who said they were worried or pessimistic remained steady at only 1% in both the May and December surveys.    Purchasing managers at more than 250 industrial companies were polled in mid-November. The forecast has been issued semiannually since December 1970.    Other findings of the survey:   --Members said their companies are operating at the highest percentage of capacity since May 1979, and at a significantly higher rate than a year ago.    --More than three-fourths of the purchasers expect higher prices over the next six months. But there are &quot;subtle signs of a possible plateauing of price increases,&quot; the association said.    --The outlook for Christmas retail sales is &quot;favorable,&quot; although not robust. The association said 37% of members expect prospects for sales in their geographic areas to be &quot;good,&quot; with 60% saying &quot;average&quot; and only 3% forecasting &quot;poor&quot; sales.    --Exports are picking up steam. The association said 78% of the companies export their products, up from 75% in the May survey, and that 80% expect to export during the first half of next year. Among that group, 52% expect a moderate increase in their export business during the next half year, while another 6% expect a substantial increase. The 58% who expect increases compares with 50% who experienced an increase over the past two months. Another 40% foresee no change, while only 2% expect a moderate decrease.    Mr. Bretz said the association's survey has &quot;a pretty good track record&quot; in forecasting business activity for the next six months. &quot;Years ago, I used to second guess the consensus with my own forecast, and I've had to eat my words later on,&quot; he said.    In addition to its semiannual forecast surveys, the association also polls members each month on business conditions. The latest survey, as previously reported, indicated the economy continued expanding in November although at a slower pace. Mr. Bretz said yesterday that probably reflects &quot;normal seasonal patterns&quot; and that a similar trend is likely in December. </TEXT></DOC>
