This further brief has been prepared in the spirit of theMinister's letter to the CNA dated May 23rd, 1985 in which Mr. Wilsonindicated his desire for continued participation of groups such as theCNA in the consultative process. Appended to this brief is a referencesheet entitled 'What Nuclear Energy Means to Canada'. The facts in thissheet are extracted from the 1985 brief and updated with the latest information.Since the major emphasis in energy related discussions is usually onsupply and demand of hydrocarbons such as oil and gas, it may come asa suprise to most Canadians that Canada's uranium production containedtwice the energy in Canada's crude oil production and exceeded the totalenergy in all of the country's crude and natural gas production in 1984.Another little known fact is that nuclear power will soon produce moreelectricity world-wide than all the world's hydro- electric plants. TheCNA intends to more widely disseminate this knowledge to the Canadianpublic. As part of that process it is hoped that the importance of uraniumboth for domestic use and exports, and Canada's success in harnessingnuclear power for peaceful and beneficial applications, will be fullyreflected in decisions and statements related to the development of governmentfiscal and energy policies. The industry wishes to maintain an ongoingdialogue with government in the following matters: substitution of non-renewableby renewable energy; assurance that electricity sales will not be taxed;maintenance of an open market for uranium with the U.S.A.; continuedsupport in research and development; approval of the Point Lepreau proposaland federal government support for sale of a reactor to Turkey.</TEXT></DOC>
