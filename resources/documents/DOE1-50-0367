Twenty-four patients with hemangiomawere encountered during the past 4 years. Five lesions over 3 cm in diameterwere correctly diagnosed with enhanced CT alone. Definite CT findingswere however obtained in only 6 out of 19 lesions smaller than 3 cm indiameter. Ultrasonography was the most sensitive method for picking upsmall liver tumors even when compared with angiography, but the findingswere non-specific (an echogenic mass was noted in 14 of the 19 lesions).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had almost the same sensitivity as ultrasoundin detecting small hemangiomas, and a prolonged T2 was highly suggestiveof the diagnosis (T2 over 80 ms in 8 of 11 lesions). The results suggestthat combined use of non-invasive diagnostic modalities has sufficientreliability to make a diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma even in smallhepatic lesions, in patients at high risk for liver cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
