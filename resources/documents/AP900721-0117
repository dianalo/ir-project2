The Arrow missile is being developed with U.S. Strategic DefenseInitiative funds to combat short-range ballistic missiles. The U.S.program is better known as ``Star Wars.''   In Washington, the U.S. Defense Department announced Friday thatit would pay for the second phase of the Arrow program.   Washington provided 80 percent of the $158 million in the firstphase of the project, and Israel's Defense Ministry supplied thebalance. Israel is seeking about $200 million from the UnitedStates for the second phase of development.   Air force commander Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin Nun, speaking on Israelradio, said the Arrow could be operational within five years.   When asked if the first test would be launched within two weeks,he said: ``This is a good assumption.''   The Arrow, which has already undergone three simulated groundtests, is designed to defend against ballistic missiles with arange of 600 miles or less.   Bin Nun said the Arrow was needed in light of efforts by Iraqand Syria to develop chemical and nuclear warheads.</TEXT></DOC>
