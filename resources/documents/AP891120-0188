The 1,050 signups have already exceeded Whittle's startup targetof having 1,000 schools participating in the service by the launchdate.   Channel One will provide daily 12-minute news programs gearedtoward teens that are to be shown in classrooms during the schoolday.   The news shows also will include two minutes of paid advertisingfor products such as candy bars and deodorant. The commercials havetriggered outcries from some national education groups and stateeducation officials in California and New York state who say it iswrong to permit companies to pitch products to a captive audienceof students.   Several cable networks have tailored commercial-free programs tothe school audience, notably Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.'sCable News Network, which is airing a daily 15-minute news showovernight to be taped for use in the classroom.   But schools participating in Channel One receive free equipmentas well as programming. Each is given dozens of televisionmonitors, a satellite dish and videocassette recorders that Whittlesays would cost them $40,000 to $50,000 if they bought them ontheir own.   The shows are transmitted overnight to the schools for replay onthe monitors during the school day.   Whittle Chairman Christopher Whittle said in a statement Sundaythe schools signed up to date are in 29 states, including seven ofthe 10 largest, and have 739,000 students.   He said his sales people have approached officials in 1,740school districts, and that 440 have signed up while 221 haverejected the service outright. Talks are continuing with the otherdistricts, and Whittle hopes to offer the service to schools in all50 states.   He said he is confident that the project will meet its goal ofhaving 7,000 to 8,000 schools with an enrollment of 6 millionstudents participating by the end of 1990.   Whittle previously said that he has signed up advertisers whohave committed about $50 million for the first year of the serviceand nearly $150 million for the first three years.   His first-year ad revenue target is $90 million.</TEXT></DOC>
