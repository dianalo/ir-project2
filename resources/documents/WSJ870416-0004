The American companies, which two years ago were paying some $2,500 more to build a car than their Japanese competitors were, have narrowed the cost gap to about $650. Detroit's cars now are typically priced below Japanese and European rivals -- by about $1,000 for many small models. And Big Three quality, though still trailing that of the best Japanese cars, has so improved that even Japanese executives concede that the gap now is small.    The upshot: General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have become more competitive than they have been since the almost-forgotten days before the first oil crisis.    &quot;I wouldn't say we've turned the corner, but at least we can see the corner,&quot; says David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president and comptroller. Echoes Tetsuo Chino, the president of Honda Motor Co.'s North American operations: &quot;I am surprised at how quickly the {Big Three} have responded and how far they have come.&quot;    How much further they will go isn't clear; over the years, they have proved adept at blowing opportunities. True to form, they used the past year's surge in prices of Japanese and German cars and trucks to raise their own prices aggressively instead of holding the line to widen their price edge. &quot;This would have been a perfect opportunity to recapture market share,&quot; fumes Wayne Angell, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board.    Nonetheless, Detroit is showing renewed vigor at a time when business has seized upon &quot;competitiveness&quot; as its buzzword. The most innovative vehicles in the past three years have come not from Japan or Europe but from Detroit. They are Ford's aerodynamic Taurus and Sable midsize cars, GM's plastic-body Pontiac Fiero and especially Chrysler's ubiquitous minivans. The minivans are so successful that Chrysler, which sat at death's door just six years ago, will soon start exporting them to Europe, along with several auto models that it builds in the U.S.    The big reason for Detroit's gains, especially in closing the price and cost gaps, is the dollar's sharp slide against the Japanese yen and German mark. In addition, productivity has been improved significantly by the Big Three, especially Ford and Chrysler. Since 1980, Chrysler, for example, has cut the work hours going into each car by 43%.    Fueling such improvements is a major, though belated, shift in attitudes. This year, for the first time since Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.'s biennial survey of auto executives began in 1979, the officials listed their own &quot;management practices&quot; first among the industry's problems.    &quot;That's very positive,&quot; says Peter C. Van Hull, the Arthur Andersen consultant who compiles the survey. &quot;It's just like being an alcoholic: You can't solve the problem until you face it.&quot;    But Detroit's tendency to blame its troubles on others lingers on. In January, for example, Ford President Harold A. Poling called for stiffer restraints on Japanese-car imports -- even though the restraints were instituted in 1981 to let Detroit get back on its feet and 1986 was Ford's most profitable year.    The irony wasn't lost on Japanese auto executives, who cheered when the Detroit News reacted with an editorial headlined &quot;What's the Matter With Ford?&quot; &quot;That's exactly how I felt,&quot; says Osamu Nobuto, the president of Mazda Motor Corp.'s U.S. manufacturing unit. &quot;Ford's attitude is strange. Overall, the competitive balance is very close.&quot;    Here is how Detroit stacks up in the principal measures of competitiveness -- production costs, prices, product quality, and management-worker attitudes.    Production Costs   The weaker dollar accounts for two-thirds of Detroit's progress toward matching Japan's production costs, but the Big Three are improving on their own, too. Ford's Chicago assembly plant, for example, turns out 64 Taurus and Sable cars an hour, up from 53 an hour for the predecessor LTD and Marquis models it stopped building 17 months ago. Moreover, the number of employees has dropped a bit.    Besides automation, another big reason for this 21% gain in efficiency is &quot;simultaneous engineering.&quot; Ford now involves manufacturing officials in the initial planning, so that cars are designed to be built efficiently. The Taurus/Sable door-opening panel, for example, consists of two parts that are welded together, instead of the nine parts on the LTD/Marquis panel.    Even GM, whose bloated costs have made it the sick man of the domestic industry, is showing pockets of progress. Its newly modernized assembly plant in Linden, N.J., requires just 29 &quot;employee hours&quot; to build each Corsica and Beretta compact. That's far below the 40-plus hours required at less advanced GM plants. However, it still trails the 23 hours at GM's Fremont, Calif., joint-venture plant managed by Toyota Motor Corp. -- even though Fremont, unlike Linden, makes its own car-body panels.    The Big Three also are seeking greater productivity from their white-collar workers. Ford, for example, has centralized expense-account processing, simplified its system by giving out corporate Visa cards and cut the number of expense-account processors to six from 18. &quot;It's a small step, but with hundreds of small steps, you get big savings,&quot; says Daniel R. Coulson, the accounting director. Indeed, Ford has steadily reduced its salaried work force to 67,200 from 86,300 seven years ago and plans another 20% cut by 1990.    Of course, the Big Three still lag behind the Japanese, who are vigorously improving their own efficiency to offset the yen's appreciation. Fledgling Third World auto makers also are stepping up cost competition. And Detroit doesn't export many cars from the U.S., although Chrysler's budding export program is at least a beginning.    Because Chrysler lacks a European dealer network, next year's goal is a modest 5,000 vehicles, but even that is an accomplishment considering that Chrysler will be saddled with shipping costs, an 11% tariff, and U.S. and European taxes. &quot;With all that,&quot; says Robert Lutz, the Chrysler executive heading the project, &quot;we will still be competitively priced with equivalent European and Japanese cars.&quot;    Prices   Since early last year, the yen's surge has prompted Japanese and European auto makers to raise prices about 20%. &quot;Our cars aren't the lowest-priced cars anymore,&quot; concedes Jim Perkins, a Toyota Motor Co. executive.    Toyota's compact Camry carries a base price of $10,648, well above the $8,169 for Chrysler's new Dodge Sundance. At $12,998, Honda's compact Accord LX must compete with the $9,918 Ford Tempo LX. Chrysler's Dodge Omni America four-door subcompact is base-priced at $6,107 -- far below Nissan Motor Co.'s comparable Sentra at $8,474 and Volkswagen AG's Golf at $8,600. What's more, Detroit has offered rebates and cheap financing on many cars.    Some imported cars contain more standard features than their domestic competitors, but that doesn't account for the entire difference. &quot;If the Accord is priced $3,000 higher than the Tempo,&quot; Ford's Mr. McCammon says, &quot;maybe there are $2,000 worth of reasons, but not $3,000 worth.&quot;    But Detroit has been on the defensive so long that it may have forgotten how to seize the offensive. The Big Three have failed to fully press their pricing edge, partly by not advertising it aggressively. &quot;This has happened so subtly that it's been lost on a lot of consumers,&quot; concedes Chrysler President Harold K. Sperlich.    What's worse, when import prices started to surge last year, GM and Ford increased their prices at midyear. Chrysler loudly declared that it wouldn't follow but then quietly raised prices on trucks -- including the popular minivans.    &quot;We've priced responsibly,&quot; insists Robert T. O'Connell, GM's vice president in charge of the finance group. GM and Ford both say their 1987 prices rose only about 4% -- but that is adjusted for optional equipment made standard. In fact, according to some estimates, the average base prices on Detroit's 1987 model cars have risen nearly 10% from 1986 to $12,013.    Some models are even higher. At $10,690, the base price of GM's Chevrolet Celebrity four-door sedan has risen 14.4% since the beginning of the 1986 model year. Ford raised its Mustang LX 14.3% to $8,645 and its Taurus L sedan 10% to $11,076.    &quot;These companies lack the vision of a world marketplace,&quot; says the Fed's Mr. Angell. &quot;We may just as well have the dollar-yen exchange rate move back&quot; toward previous levels. But Chrysler recently issued a memo asking its parts suppliers to help lobby for a still stronger yen -- to force the Japanese to raise prices &quot;by at least another 10% to 15%.&quot;    Quality   When J.D. Power Associates surveyed buyers of domestic cars last year, 45% of them reported having some sort of problem with their new car. Actually, that's good news. Five years earlier, nearly 70% had problems. Meanwhile, the number of import buyers reporting problems remained constant at about 25%.    &quot;That does show that the gap has narrowed,&quot; says John Hammond of the market-research concern. &quot;But the imports still have the lead.&quot; Auto executives, regardless of company, agree. Detroit has narrowed the quality gap more than the productivity gap, they say, because improving quality doesn't require the painful, divisive task of cutting jobs.    It does require action, as well as rhetoric, from top management, however. When Ford's internal quality ratings started slipping last year, Louis R. Ross, an executive vice president, decided to attack the problem in a series of plant visits that started as early as 7 a.m. -- on Saturdays. &quot;That got everyone's attention real quick,&quot; one manager says. So did the 1986 bonus formula, which was based 40% to 65% on a manager's contributions to quality and only about 20% on contributions to profits. Quality's weight in Ford's bonus formulas has about doubled in the past five years.    Ways of measuring quality vary. Besides owner surveys, such as Power's, auto companies conduct quality audits. GM's auditors, for example, examine cars for &quot;discrepancies,&quot; anything from a bad engine to a loose thread on a seat.    GM says its Lansing, Mich., assembly complex recently became its top-quality plant with an average of 3.9 discrepancies per car on three recent audits, down from more than eight two years ago. All the manufacturers world-wide &quot;are in the range of two to four&quot; discrepancies, says Edward P. Czapor, the vice president for quality. &quot;That's how snug this competition is getting.&quot;    But quality means more than just the absence of problems. It also means the presence of pleasing attributes -- such as quick acceleration and precise handling. Even the height of the seats can matter. After leasing the first new Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta compact cars to car-rental companies, GM soon learned that the seats were uncomfortably low; so GM raised them slightly in the cars now being launched for sale to individuals.    Nevertheless, the Japanese and Europeans have an edge in these &quot;things gone right,&quot; as well in introducing such technological advances as anti-lock braking, four-wheel steering and engines with four valves per cylinder instead of two. The additional valves, which increase power dramatically by putting more air in the combustion chamber, are currently available on several foreign cars, but Detroit won't introduce them until 1988.    The Big Three recently tried to dramatize their new confidence in their quality by extending warranties -- to six years or 60,000 miles on engines and transmissions at GM and Ford, and seven years or 70,000 miles at Chrysler. That exceeds anything offered by the Japanese.    Some experts say the Big Three are remiss in not aggressively advertising their advantage. But &quot;we don't judge this is a strong offensive weapon in reestablishing our credibility with people who say only foreign companies make high-quality cars,&quot; Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen says. Word of mouth will work better in the long run, Ford officials say, as it did for the imports.    Changing Attitudes   Animosity between management and labor still hurts the Big Three, but attitudes are changing. Detroit is learning from the Japanese that hourly workers have more to contribute than muscle.    At Ford's Chicago plant, for example, hourly workers may call executives of parts suppliers directly if they spot problems or have suggestions. And at GM's Lansing plant, workers decided to switch the system for building bumpers back to a traditional assembly line after trying to let individuals assemble entire bumpers. The traditional system distributed the work more evenly, the workers believed, and thus was more efficient. The Lansing plant also recently eliminated two symbolic items that divide managers and workers -- the executive parking garage and the executive dining room.    And at GM's engine factory in Tonowanda, N.Y., near Buffalo, salaried and hourly workers now can use the same bathrooms. The bathrooms were segregated until last January, when a reporter touring the plant asked why. Earlier attempts to change had run &quot;into such incredible resistance from the salaried employees that we couldn't believe it,&quot; says John P. Hughes, the plant's production superintendent.    This fall, when GM and Ford will negotiate new contracts with the United Auto Workers in the U.S. and Canada, labor-management tensions certainly will rise. Workers are already irked by the &quot;outsourcing&quot; of work to nonunion people and, at GM, by plant closings and the absence of profit-sharing payments at a time when executives are getting bonuses.    Ultimately, however, anger may yield to fear. &quot;We're all afraid of Japan,&quot; says Arlond L. Pearsall, a GM production worker at Lansing. &quot;New Japanese plants are springing up all over the U.S., and Japanese cars are all over the place. We have to be just as good as they are.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
