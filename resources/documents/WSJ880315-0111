Greenberger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MDEST </CO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State George Shultz will use friendly persuasion, rather than blunt pressure, to try to induce a reluctant Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to accept a U.S. peace plan when the two meet here today.    Mr. Shultz is considering offering Mr. Shamir several private letters of assurance to allay the prime minister's concerns that the U.S. peace initiative for the Israeli-occupied territories will jeopardize Israel's security. Such letters also would be designed to bolster Mr. Shamir's political standing at home, according to U.S. officials and others familiar with the Reagan administration's thinking.    Moreover, the secretary of state has dropped the previous U.S. insistence that Israel and the Arabs either accept or reject the peace plan this week. Instead, Washington now is only requesting that a response come &quot;in the near future,&quot; according to a senior U.S. official.    The low-key approach reflects a U.S. recognition that Israel's coalition government -- and the country's public opinion -- is hopelessly divided over how to deal with the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Reagan administration officials fear that with an Israeli national election set for later this year, U.S. pressure on Mr. Shamir could produce a backlash, driving the electorate further to the right and away from any accommodation with rioting Palestinians in the occupied territories.    While eschewing the use of direct pressure, the administration is trying to remind Mr. Shamir that the turmoil in the region is potentially destabilizing and must be dealt with promptly. &quot;We are not pressing Israel,&quot; the senior U.S. official said during a briefing yesterday. &quot;It's the situation in the area that is pressing Israel and all the parties in the area.&quot;    Mr. Shultz launched his peace initiative on the theory that the widespread Palestinian uprising, which now is in its fourth month, would prod the parties toward negotiations. Thus far, however, the violence has hardened positions on both sides.    Israel's Labor Party, led by Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, favors the Shultz plan, but Mr. Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposes it and insists that the first priority is restoring order. Meanwhile, in the occupied territories, the Palestinians' success in attracting world attention and sympathy has made them more radical and less willing to consider political compromise.    Mr. Shultz's plan calls initially for an international conference under the auspices of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- the U.S., Soviet Union, Britain, France and China. This would be followed by negotiations, beginning as early as May, between Israel and a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation over an interim arrangement for the territories. Finally, beginning in December, there would be talks on the final status of the territories.    Mr. Shamir fears the U.N. conference would turn into an anti-Israel propaganda forum. So Mr. Shultz is considering offering him a letter addressing some of his concerns; for example, the U.S. would pledge not to attend the international session if the U.N. invited the Palestine Liberation Organization. Both the U.S. and Israel refuse to negotiate with the PLO until it specifically recognizes Israel's right to exist and rejects terrorism.    Further, it is understood that as another inducement to get Mr. Shamir to accept the U.N. conference, Mr. Shultz is considering giving the Israeli prime minister a political plum: he would offer to make permanent some of the recent strategic arrangements that give Israel the same favorable status as formal U.S. allies when it comes to bidding on government contracts and sharing research and development.    A U.S. official cautioned, &quot;There haven't been any decisions made yet; we're waiting until they've had a chance to talk.&quot;    Mr. Shamir made clear yesterday, however, that he hasn't altered his negative view of the Shultz plan. When his airplane landed here, he stressed that he preferred direct negotiations with Arab states, along the Camp David model used to achieve peace between Israel and Egypt.    And in a speech prepared for delivery last night before the United Jewish Appeal Young Leadership, he strongly criticized the concept of trading land for peace that is at the heart of the Shultz plan. &quot;Did we have peace when we did not have these territories?&quot; he asked. He also said Israel would &quot;never allow&quot; Jerusalem to be divided again. Israel occupied the territories in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.    Expressing in advance his appreciation that the U.S. understands Israel's security needs, Mr. Shamir yesterday also offered an observation that could be a dismal prophesy: &quot;Israel is situated in a region where violence and terror and war are endemic, and where the landscape is littered with broken agreements.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
