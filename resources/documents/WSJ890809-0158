Alexandr Voinov heads a 100-member Soviet delegation that hopes to entice corporate customers with small talk, dare-devil flying exhibitions and Western marketing techniques. If all that fails, Mr. Voinov says he can offer an even more powerful incentive: cut-rate prices.    &quot;We are intent on {using} every method, every potential tool, to help penetrate Western markets,&quot; Mr. Voinov says. But he concedes that unless Soviet aircraft designs are adapted to meet the needs of consumers, and large sums are invested in long-term promotion, &quot;you can't talk seriously about marketing.&quot;    Such tactics show just how serious Moscow's aircraft makers are these days to boost civilian exports, even at the expense of military production. To earn badly needed foreign currency, Soviet officials are hawking everything from helicopters and specialty sport planes to the latest generation of commuter jets and long-range Ilyushin airliners.    &quot;The Russians are desperate to play a bigger part in the international aerospace community,&quot; says James Roberts, a senior U.S. Commerce Department official. U.S. industry and government analysts doubt that slashing prices or using other sales gimmicks will be enough to give Mr. Voinov's team a major breakthrough in supplying commercial aircraft to the West.    That's the main reason the Soviets showed up in such force for Vancouver's Abbotsford Air Show and exposition, which formally opens today. Some 8,000 additional industry participants are expected at this usually sleepy airfield to marvel at the hot planes and hammer out deals.    Spectators cheered wildly as a pair of sleek MiG-29 fighters -- making their first appearance in North America -- roared low over the field Sunday with their Canadian air force escorts. After they landed, the MiG pilots, guzzling welcoming beers on the hot tarmac, were surrounded by reporters and aviation buffs eager to get a glimpse of the high-performance fighters.    Minutes later, the 500-ton Antonov An-225, the world's largest airplane, lumbered to a landing with all six engines howling. The cargo-transport behemoth can carry up to 80 vehicles in its belly.    The Abbotsford show was conceived as North America's answer to the displays at Paris and Farnborough, England. Its sponsors sought a large Soviet turnout to give their previously low-profile event instant prestige. For Mr. Voinov and his colleagues, the show is another chance to practice high-stakes salesmanship.    So far, the results indicate modest success. Mr. Voinov says he expects to sign a contract in a few weeks to sell two more SU-26 acrobatic planes to U.S. investors, but won't disclose details. The first two of the Russian stunt planes ever sold in the U.S. were delivered to a Pompano Beach, Fla., aircraft dealer this month.    Soviet officials also said a prospective U.S. customer is eager to lease the mighty An-225 -- as well as its entire crew -- to haul oversize cargo. And Mr. Voinov hopes to leave behind a Ka-32 helicopter at a bargain price, giving Canadian timber and oil-drilling firms a chance to appreciate its heavy lift capabilities.    Until recently, the Soviets didn't seem interested in the vagaries of marketing. When they came to sell helicopters in the U.S. last year, &quot;the Russians didn't bring along a bunch of glossy brochures,&quot; recalls John Zugschwert, executive director of the American Helicopter Society. &quot;They weren't salesmen. They were clearly engineers.&quot;    This year the Soviets have moved commercial sales to the front burner. The export arm of the Soviet Ministry of Aviation Industry hopes to double its revenue by the mid-1990s. But such a shift would bring major upheavals to the Soviet system. Orders for military aircraft have fallen 20% in the past two years, according to some estimates. And, for the first time in decades, prestigious military design bureaus in the Soviet Union are devoting substantial manpower to civilian projects.    U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says the only way Mikhail Gorbachev can revitalize the Soviet economy is by shifting &quot;resources away from the military sector to the civilian side of the house.&quot; Based on preliminary indications, says Mr. Cheney, &quot;those are precisely {Mr. Gorbachev's} intentions.&quot;    In past air shows, the Russians touted the power and speed of their military jets. This time, even the MiGs are an important part of the commercial sales pitch, with Soviet officials stressing that the laminated materials and new manufacturing techniques used on the fighters are being applied to commercial jet production.    Soviet aviation officials are even seeking advice from prospective customers, including West European charter groups, before designing new aircraft. Some U.S. analysts contend that Moscow is seriously thinking about using more-dependable and fuel-efficient Western engines on Russian-built planes.    To attract buyers, the Soviets have sold certain helicopters at prices that cover only about one-third of production costs, says Rand Corp. economist Arthur Alexander. Moscow is willing to swallow such losses, Mr. Alexander and others believe, to keep production lines operating and to achieve product recognition in the West.    Officials of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. say the Soviet marketing drive doesn't worry them. But Mr. Roberts of the Commerce Department, whose job is promoting foreign sales of U.S. airliners, takes a more cautious view.    &quot;There are some major concerns&quot; in the Bush administration, he says, that the Soviets &quot;may choose to virtually give their aircraft away.&quot; While the U.S. remains eager to promote peaceful Soviet trade, he asserts, &quot;we want them to be a fair competitor.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
