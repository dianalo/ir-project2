Thisresults from the perceived minor significance of resulting effects; thehighly site-specific nature of effects, particularly in the coastal zone;difficulties in separating coastal effects related with offshore energyactivities with those due to other human activities and natural processes;and the lack, until recently, of organized or official expressions ofconcern where physical alterations have been most extensive, the northernGulf of Mexico. As a result of the paucity of information from the literature,the authors have had to rely heavily on reports of limited distributionor outside of the formal scientific literature (such as environmentalimpact statements and personal experience). In addition, in some casesextant data is reanalyzed. In this chapter, the authors consider theeffects of physical alterations on offshore environments generally andthen discuss effects on coastal environments by major geographic regionsof the United States. The regional orientation of the discussion is toaccommodate the great regional differences in coastal environmental sensitivity,history of development and likely future development activities. Theyconclude with recommendations for future studies and management strategies.</TEXT></DOC>
