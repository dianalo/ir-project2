<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-72-0012 </DOCNO><TEXT>Parity simulation has emerged, in recent years, as a powerful techniquefor the analysis of systems exhibiting time-variant topology caused bythe switch-mode operation of incorporated power electronic devices. Itsprinciple of simulation, versatility and application in power systemsare described. Parity simulations of a current-dependent non-linear inductorand a thyristor are developed using analog and digital integrated circuits.Features of non-linear inductor simulation include independently controllablebreakpoints and slopes. The thyristor model evaluates the terminal conditionsand makes a logic decision regarding its switching state. Forward dropand turn-off time are modeled. Results for the simulation of a thyristorcontrolled reactor consisting of a pair of back-to-back connected thyristorsin series with a linear resistive-reactive load are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
