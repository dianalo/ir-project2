Bass Group Inc. completed the acquisition of Wometco Cable Co. from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. for about $620 million.    As previously reported, Kohlberg Kravis in October agreed to sell Wometco's cable television unit to the venture. Kohlberg Kravis arranged a 1984 leveraged buyout of Wometco Broadcasting Inc. for about $800 million.    Wometco Cable operates cable systems serving about 362,000 subscribers, primarily in North and South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana. Taft said Wometco's management team will stay in place with oversight from Taft.    In a leveraged buyout, an investor group acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
