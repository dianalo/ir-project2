With both the guerrillas and army so well-armed andentrenched, a truce is overly optimistic. Besides, cease-fires come and gooften with no progress.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HOPE FOR THE WAR-WEARYIN EL SALVADOR, SMALL REFORMS MAY BE SLOW,BUT COULD ACCOMPLISH MUCH  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     What's promising were the agreements reached on some significantconstitutional changes. In El Salvador, taking incremental steps towardfundamental reforms may be slow, but it counts more than half-heartedcease-fires.;    The Mexico negotiators agreed that the military be madeaccountable to civilian authority, create a civilian police force, strengthenthe judiciary, and allow the United Nations to investigate the human rightsatrocities of the 1980s.;    Why the sudden realism? After 11 years of civilwar and about 75,000 deaths, both sides seem to know they can't win withoutfurther slaughter.;    Meanwhile, Congress and the White House, while stillsupporting the conservative government and army, are losing their patiencewith right-wing belligerence and corruption. Salvadoran President AlfredoCristiani seems to be asserting his authority. And Mexico, under a newpresident, has decided to aggressively pursue a diplomatic solution.;    Thereare still plenty of traps. The guerrillas' demands for land reform and themilitary's appetite for U.S. weapons represent major mine fields.;    But atleast a little progress has emerged from the negotiating table. In the contextof El Salvador's civil war, that's a breakthrough for peace.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910505  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  257  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday May 5, 199100126187,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
