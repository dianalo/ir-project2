VLA 21 cm D-configuration observationsdisclosed the presence of a total of 5.6 x 10 to the 9th/sq h solar massesof neutral hydrogen - nearly half of which resides in two main structuresextending as far as 98/h kpc from Arp 144. An additional amount of HI flux resides outside the velocity range covered by these observations.The overall H I distribution is consistent with the Freeman and de Vaucouleursmodel. It may be possible to identify one of the large neutral hydrogenfeatures as part of the IGC, with the other arising from tidal forces.An alternate hypothesis which views Arp 144 as an ongoing merger betweenthe galaxies NGC 7828 and NGC 7829 is also considered. 12 references.</TEXT></DOC>
