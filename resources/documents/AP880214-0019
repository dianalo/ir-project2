The Ministry of Defense deniedthere had been a crisis.   No public announcement had been made earlier about the incident.   On Sunday, a ministry spokesman who wouldn't be identified said:``There was no emergency. There was no possibility of anybody, crewor general public, being subjected to any radiation problems. Therewas a minor electrical malfunction but no radioactive material wasreleased.''   The spokesman said the weekly was incorrect in claiming anuclear accident was averted by minutes.   The Observer said that, on Jan. 26, at the nuclear submarinebase at Faslane near Glasgow, a fault developed in the primarycooling system of the nuclear reactor power plant on HMSResolution, the oldest of Britain's four operational nuclearsubmarines, commissioned in 1967.   The fault led to heat building up in the reactor's core,threatening a meltdown, and potential disaster was only avertedwhen two of the crew ran to start up a diesel generator to providealternative power for the cooler, the report said.   It said there was only between 1{ and 7 minutes for the crew totake action and one of the two crewmen had to be scrubbed down for24 hours afterward because he was exposed to radiation.   A meltdown could have released radioactivity contaminating 2,000square miles with ``devastating consequences'' for the 13,000people living within a five-mile radius of the base, the reportsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
