Boesky get?    It depends on whom you ask. Some say a few months in prison would be fine for the former arbitrager. Others say a few years seems fair. And still others want him to sit in jail for a long, long time.    Well, everybody should find out Friday. After several delays, that's when a federal judge is expected to sentence Mr. Boesky. Only one thing is certain: Mr. Boesky's severest critics won't be satisfied because he faces a maximum sentence of five years, with parole possible after serving one-third of his sentence.    Mr. Boesky paid $100 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges of insider trading and other securities law violations, and was later allowed to plead guilty to one felony in return for cooperating in the government's investigation of wrongdoing on Wall Street.    Wall Street Journal reporters asked prominent defense attorneys, prosecutors and others what they thought Mr. Boesky should get. Here are some of their answers.    'THEY SHOULD THROW   THE BOOK AT HIM'   &quot;I think they should throw the book at him,&quot; says Vincent Chiarella, a financial printer who was the first person convicted of criminal insider trading but later had his conviction overturned by the Supreme Court. His advice to the sentencing judge: &quot;The full five-year sentence, (and not) at one of these country clubs.&quot;    Mr. Chiarella believes Mr. Boesky will actually get two years. &quot;I think the public and Wall Street would be in an uproar if he didn't get anything,&quot; Mr. Chiarella says. &quot;It would show people that crime pays. They say crime doesn't pay, but crime pays.&quot;    'I'D SEE THAT HE GETS   A LITTLE TIME AWAY'   F. Lee Bailey, a criminal defense attorney, says that &quot;it's awfully hard to say (what Mr. Boesky should get) without knowing the extent of his cooperation with the government, which is what he's leaning on. I'm not a fan of people who rape the system and then get nothing but a slap on the wrist because they squeal. If I were sentencing Mr. Boesky, I'd see to it that he gets a little time away.&quot;    Still, Mr. Bailey says, insider traders &quot;aren't a danger to society. They're not going to go out and do anything again. And I doubt that any single person was damaged very much.&quot;    'IN THE SAME CELL   WITH PEOPLE HE CORRUPTED'   Describing himself as one of Mr. Boesky's &quot;biggest enemies,&quot; Guy Wyser-Pratte, executive vice president and head of risk arbitrage at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., would like to see an unusual sentence imposed. &quot;He should have to be in the same cell with all the people he corrupted,&quot; Mr. Wyser-Pratte says. Three years seems right, he says.    'THE WHOLE THING   IS AMAZING TO ME'   John Templeton, the Nassau, Bahamas-based mutual-fund manager, says he's ignored the insider-trading scandal.    &quot;I haven't the slightest idea what kind of sentence he should get,&quot; Mr. Templeton says. &quot;The whole thing is amazing to me. I've heard his name, but I thought it was pronounced Besky.&quot;    'HE COULD TEACH PEOPLE   A LOT OF THINGS'   Marvin Mitchelson, the Los Angeles defense attorney who represented Joan Collins in her recent divorce and Michele Triola in her palimony case against actor Lee Marvin, says that &quot;obviously the man is being punished reputation-wise, and that's a big consideration at this stage of his life. He's contrite about it. He appears to be. I would think something around a year or six months isn't out of line and would be somewhat fair.&quot;    Mr. Mitchelson says that community-service work should be part of any sentence. &quot;He could teach a lot of people a lot of things. He certainly was a brilliant man and knew this field as well or better than anyone else.&quot;    'HE OUGHT TO GET   A MINIMUM OF 25 YEARS'   Morris Dees, executive director of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., says Mr. Boesky is &quot;responsible for, in effect, stealing millions of dollars from investors. I've represented or been connected with several individuals who've robbed a liquor store and gotten $200 or $300, and they've gotten 20 years. Boesky does it with a pen. They do it with a gun. That's the only difference.&quot;    Mr. Dees thinks Mr. Boesky &quot;ought to get a minimum of 25 years and serve seven or eight. That's even with his cooperation. The fact that he's given millions of dollars of it back, that doesn't matter. It wasn't his to begin with.&quot;    Mr. Dees recommends treble damages for those convicted of insider trading. &quot;If you stole $100 million, then you have to give $300 million back. That would sting them where it hurts.&quot;    'BY AND LARGE, THE GUY   IS A VERY SOLID CITIZEN'   Bernie Cornfeld, financier and former head of the collapsed Investors Overseas Services mutual-fund empire, was acquitted of fraud by a Swiss court eight years ago. He says he wouldn't be in favor of incarceration of Mr. Boesky. If he is jailed, Mr. Cornfeld says, &quot;I think it should be very brief to let the financial community and people generally know that this is a dangerous practice.&quot; Mr. Cornfeld would consider a five-year sentence &quot;absurd.&quot;    He adds: &quot;By and large this guy, generally speaking, is a very solid citizen. What he was doing in an extreme way was pretty much what everyone in the business has been trying to do. The whole nature of business is to outdo the next guy based on whatever information you can get. Very often it turns out to be information you shouldn't have.&quot;    'SENTENCE SHOULDN'T INVOLVE   EXCESSIVE INCARCERATION'   Howard Weitzman, a Los Angeles defense attorney for John Z. De Lorean, says he expects Mr. Boesky to get no less than a five-year sentence.    But, he adds, &quot;I don't think that is necessarily the right sentence. A sentence in this type of case shouldn't involve excessive incarceration but should involve restitution and meaningful community contributions. Mr. Boesky should spend whatever he has left in money and time making the community whole. I don't know whether a lengthy incarceration will do anyone any good. Some incarceration is called for, maybe a year or two years.&quot;    'YOU HAVE THE IMPORTANCE   OF SETTING AN EXAMPLE'   &quot;As the head pig at the trough, he deserves to get his snout snapped,&quot; says Arthur Miller, the Harvard law professor who hosts &quot;The Delicate Balance&quot; and other television shows on the law.    &quot;If I were the judge I'd send him to jail. Not only do you have the importance of setting an example for other people in the industry, but there is also the magnitude of the crime and the importance of demonstrating to people that the law will treat white, wealthy businessmen with the same degree of sternness that is usually reserved for blacks and others.&quot;    Mr. Miller predicts Mr. Boesky will get five years, &quot;but won't serve more than two or three years.&quot;    'GUYS LIKE BOESKY   HAVE NO CONSCIENCE'   Joseph Russoniello, U.S. Attorney in San Francisco, thinks a five-year sentence would be appropriate. He feels that a sentence measured in terms of months won't demonstrate that white-collar crime is taken seriously. &quot;My personal feeling is that something with 'months' on it sort of suggests he was selling defective washing machines,&quot; Mr. Russoniello says.    He says courts have been too lenient in sentencing white-collar criminals. &quot;I think it reflects an attitude about white-collar criminals, that these people are no serious danger to society.    &quot;Guys like Boesky have no conscience. It's not even the dollars; they have more money than they can ever spend. It's the power, the play, the challenge, the idea of living on the edge. It's profiting off the worst side of our human nature.&quot;    'I FEEL HE WILL BE   SENTENCED TO SIX YEARS'   &quot;I feel he will be sentenced to six years,&quot; says Debra Lynch, the New Jersey astrologer best known for predicting the Oct. 19 market crash. Six years, she says, because he'll get the maximum five, plus an additional year for &quot;another matter&quot; that she augurs will come to light next December.    But, Ms. Lynch says, Mr. Boesky will end up serving 18 months, &quot;and they might give him a real cushy, country-club deal.&quot;    She adds: &quot;I predict there will be four major new scandals in the next months with four new people being named. One of them will come out of the Boesky investigation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
