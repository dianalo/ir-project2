The unit's deposits represent only about 1.9% of Great Western's total deposits of about $21 billion. But the move could be significant if Great Western finds a way to move some of the deposits from its other thrift units into the Washington state unit.    Moving deposits to insurance coverage by the FDIC from coverage by the FSLIC would save operating costs, because the FDIC charges premiums that are only 40% as much as those charged by the FSLIC.    The switch, which was effective yesterday, involves Great Western Savings Bank of Bellevue, Wash., which has deposits of about $490 million. Great Western Financial's largest unit is Great Western Bank, a California thrift with assets of about $28 billion. Among thrifts, Great Western bank ranks behind the Home Savings of America unit of H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., Los Angeles; and American Savings andamp; Loan Association, Stockton, Calif.    For several months, thrift industry analysts have speculated that Great Western Financial is seeking a method of switching California-based Great Western Bank into the FDIC from the FSLIC.    Analysts and thrift-industry lawyers have speculated that Great Western might try to shift some of the branches or deposits of California-based Great Western into the Washington state unit after the Washington state unit moved into the FDIC.    Great Western Financial declined to comment on speculation about its alternatives for fleeing the FSLIC. However, the company said it will save about $500,000 annually in deposit-insurance premiums by switching the Washington unit to FDIC coverage.    FSLIC-insured thrifts currently are barred by law from switching into the FDIC unless their applications were filed before April 1987. Great Western's Washington unit qualified to switch under that exemption. Thrifts wishing to leave the FSLIC also must pay an exit fee equal to two years' total FSLIC premiums.    Great Western now has five small FDIC-insured units. The others are located in New York, Colorado and Utah. </TEXT></DOC>
