The regional railroad, a subsidiary of closely held Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., said the filing is the result of an arbitrator's ruling last week that barred a sharp reduction of the Delaware andamp; Hudson's labor costs and &quot;other financial conditions.&quot; The arbitrator's decision stopped North Billerica, Mass.-based Guilford from including the Delaware andamp; Hudson in a plan to lease all its railroads to a subsidiary that has flexible work practices and low wages.    Railroad executives said the proposed bankruptcy-law filing is important beyond the Delaware andamp; Hudson, a financially troubled 1,200-mile line primarily in New York and Pennsylvania. They said the railroad has become the latest casualty in Guilford's two-year battle to escape costly union work rules and manning requirements. Such high labor costs have become a burden to the entire railroad industry, which is struggling to compete with trucks.    The Delaware andamp; Hudson said Friday it can't operate the railroad any longer than 48 to 72 hours on existing cash reserves and hasn't any realistic opportunity to generate outside sources of cash. The Interstate Commerce Commission said it expects to designate today an interim operator of the Delaware andamp; Hudson. The commission said it is considering proposals from Consolidated Rail Corp., Philadelphia, and Delaware Otsego Corp., a regional carrier based in Cooperstown, N.Y.    A Guilford official said the Delaware andamp; Hudson, which has about 850 employees, had assets of $75 million and liabilities of $108 million as of March 31. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor suits while it tries to work out a plan to pay its debts.    The Delaware andamp; Hudson's list of major creditors is expected to show the largest unsecured debt was about $70 million owed to the Federal Railroad Administration, the Guilford official said. Officials of the agency couldn't be reached for comment.    The Delaware andamp; Hudson serves only a few major freight shippers along its lines and has survived by hauling long-distance shipments for other railroads. During the past 10 years state and federal governments have pumped money into the railroad, whose main line track has been substantially improved. The federal government also granted the Delaware andamp; Hudson trackage rights to Buffalo, N.Y., and Alexandria, Va., to increase the railroad's ability to compete with rival Conrail. Guilford, owned by Timothy Mellon of the Pittsburgh Mellon family, bought the Delaware andamp; Hudson in 1984 for $500,000 from Norfolk Southern Corp., but has failed to reverse the railroad's losses.    Last year the Delaware andamp; Hudson had a net loss of $8.1 million on revenue of $80.6 million. A Guilford official said the Delaware andamp; Hudson's losses widened to about $8 million for the 1988 year to date.    Two years ago Guilford, whose other rail holdings are the Boston andamp; Maine and the Maine Central railroads, mounted an attack on railroad work rules. Congress settled a two-month strike at Guilford in 1986 on terms favorable to labor. Guilford has since transferred the Boston andamp; Maine and Maine Central to Springfield Terminal, a subsidiary that has lenient work practices and reduced labor costs. Guilford said that under Springfield Terminal the Delaware andamp; Hudson could reduce its expenses by more than $1 million a month and turn a profit. For example, the railroad would be able to operate with crews of two men, compared with the five men it currently uses to operate each of its freight trains.    Last year the Interstate Commerce Commission, bowing to the pleas of rail labor, blocked the lease of the Delaware andamp; Hudson to Springfield Terminal pending an arbitrator's ruling.    The arbitrator, Richard Kasher, ruled last Wednesday that the lease arrangements were invalid and ordered Guilford to honor its labor contracts. Guilford said it would continue to operate the Boston andamp; Maine and Maine Central, which are both profitable, while it appeals the ruling to the ICC. But F. Colin Pease, a Guilford vice president, said the arbitrator's decision &quot;destroyed the ability of the Delaware andamp; Hudson to reduce its costs and compete in today's market.&quot;    Rail unions have opposed Guilford's use of its Springfield Terminal subsidiary. Geoffrey Zeh, president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, said Springfield Terminal is &quot;a subterfuge to get around existing law and existing contracts.&quot;    Guilford had another blow last week. Another arbitrator ordered Guilford to reinstate with back pay more than 1,000 striking workers at Springfield Terminal. Last fall rail workers, represented by the United Transportation Union, struck Springfield Terminal, alleging safety problems. But the carrier has been able to operate reduced service using supervisors and nonunion workers. </TEXT></DOC>
