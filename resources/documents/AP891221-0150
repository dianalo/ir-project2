China said the events in Romania were an internal affair. InBeijing, the China-Romania Friendship Association opened alaudatory photographic exhibit called ``Romania in SocialistConstruction.''   West Germany, Austria, Britain and Hungary requested an urgentmeeting of the U.N. Security Council.   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, expressed``profound anxiety'' about developments in Romania.   ``It is essential that this situation be handled with scrupulousrespect for the universal Declaration of Human Rights and inaccordance with the U.N. Charter,'' Perez de Cuellar said.   Britain urged ``all nations'' to condemn ``this behavior, whichis an affront to all internationally accepted norms.''   Demonstrations against President Nicolae Ceausescu's governmentbegan last weekend in Timisoara, a city in western Romania, andhave spread to other parts of the country, including Bucharest.   Estimates by witnesses of the number of people killed inTimisoara range from hundreds to 4,000. Reports from Bucharest saidsecurity forces fired into crowds of protesters in the capitalThursday, but no precise casualty reports were available.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Bouchersaid the U.S. Embassy in Buchrest reported that 13 young peoplewere killed by automatic weapons fire from government securityforces during the demonstration. He said other fatalities may haveoccurred as well.   Romania's conduct has isolated it from Warsaw Pact allies, wherethe trend is toward democracy and economic reform.   Thousands of people chanting anti-Ceausescu slogans and wavingbanners for freedom gathered outside Romanian embassies in Prague,Budapest and Belgrade, the capitals of Czechoslovakia, Hungary andYugoslavia. Demonstrators burned an effigy of Ceauesescu outsidethe Romanian Embassy in Vienna, Austria.   In Paris, Federico Mayor, the head of the U.N. Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organization, summoned Romanianrepresentative Petre Gigea and reminded him Romania had promised touphold human dignity before it was allowed to join UNESCO.   At the end of the current round of the East-West conventionalarms talks in Vienna, a diplomat expressed concern that the troublein Romania could jeopardize negotiations on reducing militaryforces in Europe.   ``It's feared that Hungary and Romania will no longer sit on thesame side of the negotiation table,'' the diplomat said privately.   Official Soviet reaction was cautious, but coverage of Romaniaby the state news agency Tass gave vivid accounts of violenceagainst demonstrators.   ``If we do receive information on victims among people we, ofcourse, will be extremely sorry about them,'' said Vadim Perfiliev,a spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry.   ``We should emphasize that we do have opinions on what ishappening, but ... I cannot go into comments without havingall-inclusive information and orders in that regard.''   On a visit to East Berlin, Mitterrand was more direct.   ``It is a regime of personal, family power that has no honestreason to remain,'' he said. ``I think that the days of thisregime, in a Europe in full movement, are numbered.''   He ruled out foreign intervention amd said: ``The response hasto come from Romania.''   In Bonn, Helmut Kohl's chief spokesman, Hans Klein, said thechancellor was ``deeply shocked by the brutal repression of thejustified and peaceful protests. He strongly condemns the massiveuse of weapons and the reprehensible attempts by the Romanianleadership to suppress the efforts for freedom and democracy.''   Klein said Kohl ``appeals to those responsible at all levels inRomania to halt repression by the military and security police, andto open a dialogue on the justified demands of people.''   In London, the Foreign Office said withdrawing their ambassadorsfrom Romania was one of several options being considered by the 12European Community members.   Italy announced it had recalled its ambassador, Luigi Amaduzzi,for consultations.   East Germany condemned the ``brutal action of the Romanian statepower against peaceful citizens demonstrating to assert theirelementary human rights.''   It urged the Romanian government stop the violence and recalledAmbassador Herbert Plaschke for consultations.   Czechoslovakia summoned a senior Romanian diplomat to receive aprotest from the Foreign Ministry in Prague.   Government and other protests continued in Hungary, which hastense relations with Ceausescu's regime because of allegedharassment of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania.   ``There exists or has developed in Romania a serious politicalmovement,'' said Foreign Minister Gyula Horn. ``It is ananti-Ceausescu movement. There is no accurate information on itsstrength, or the extent to which it has spread.''   Greece condemned the suppression and the Athens Academy ofSciences canceled the membership awarded in 1976 to Ceausescu'swife, Elena, the second most powerful person in Romania.</TEXT></DOC>
