Brookes</HL><DD> 01/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) </IN><TEXT>   One of the issues on which congressional Democrats hope to create a record between now and 1988 is welfare reform, a euphemism for various forms of &quot;workfare,&quot; or work and training.    So far, the model most often cited for this effort is the Education and Training program (ET) started in September 1983 by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who has skillfully used ET's &quot;successes,&quot; along with a bouyant state economy, as a jumping-off platform for a 1988 presidential candidacy.    Last year, Sen. Edward Kennedy co-sponsored with Rep. Jack Kemp a national welfare-work program modeled almost entirely on ET. It includes free day care for welfare recipients placed in jobs and continuation of Medicaid benefits where needed, along with extensive education and training provisions. A similar package will be introduced this year.    But before Congress and the public wax enthusiastic about a national ET, they ought to examine the actual record (as opposed to the Dukakis public-relations presentation) in Massachusetts. And they should compare that record with those in other states, and in particular Massachusetts's neighbor, New Hampshire, where a far less costly and elaborate job-outreach program to the private sector has accomplished much better results. In fact, the results in Massachusetts are so poor as to call into question the entire ET program as a waste of taxpayer dollars, now nearly $50 million a year.    At the end of September 1983, when the ET program began, the Massachusetts basic caseload of Aid to Families with Dependent Children was 86,999. Three years and more than $80 million in ET-spending later, the Massachusetts AFDC basic caseload has risen -- to 87,460. (This followed a 26% reduction during 1981-83 from 121,400, under former Gov. Edward King's compulsory Work and Training program.)    At the same time, new applications for AFDC in Massachusetts's booming economy have risen 9% to 14,890 in the 1986 third quarter from 13,657 in the like 1983 quarter, while actual case terminations (mainly the result of people going back into the work force) have actually fallen 1.5% to 10,544 in the '86 third period from 10,700 in the like 1983 period.    All of this was in an economy whose basic unemployment rate fell more than 40% from 7.2% in September 1983 to 4.2% last September 1986.    As one Department of Health and Human Services official involved in family assistance observed, &quot;You have to wonder why any economy like that needs a $50 million-a-year special training and placement program. If you can't cut the basic caseload in that situation, there's something very wrong with what you are doing.&quot;    Massachusetts Welfare Commissioner Charles Atkins said last year, however, that &quot;unemployment levels have never determined welfare caseloads. With AFDC you're talking mostly about people who aren't even in the labor force.&quot;    To a degree, Mr. Atkins is right, but his own ET data show more than half of all Massachusetts monthly case terminations were people finding jobs on their own. And most national welfare studies show that for the majority of AFDC clients, welfare-use periods are initiated and terminated by changes in employment status.    What should most alarm Mr. Atkins is that in New Hampshire, Gov. John Sununu has shown that low unemployment can be used as a leverage to get private-sector employers to take on AFDC clients with no investment in tax-financed bribes.    In the same three-year period (September 1983 to September 1986) in which the Massachusetts welfare caseload rose 0.5%, New Hampshire's already low caseload of 6,689 fell about 30% to 4,667, and has continued to fall to less than 4,400.    More important, while entries into New Hampshire system's fell 18%, terminations rose nearly 5%, so the trend toward lower welfare caseloads is continuing, and all this with a very modest &quot;training and outreach&quot; program that costs New Hampshire less than $500,000 a year, or the equivalent of less than $8 million for Massachusetts's much larger caseloads.    All this has been accomplished even as welfare benefits in New Hampshire were actually raised on a regular cost-of-living basis; they are now among the 12 highest in the nation. Gov. Sununu's formula for success: &quot;There is only one solution to welfare, and that's plenty of jobs -- a state economy where unemployment is so low, employers are glad to accept even the hard-core welfare clients.&quot;    When Gov. Sununu took office, he surprised many of his conservative constituents by immediately proposing regular cost-of-living increases for AFDC clients. But he coupled this carrot with a commitment to use his office for outreach to the private sector for a maximum job-placement program.    &quot;We knew that with the New Hampshire economy booming, and unemployment going down to 2.2%, we would never again have such a good opportunity to get AFDC folks into rewarding jobs. So we asked the private sector to cooperate.&quot;    Gov. Sununu also &quot;changed the incentives&quot; for the welfare caseworkers and their supervisors. &quot;Instead of rewarding them for large caseloads, we told them they would be rated on how well they put these folks into jobs, and we made a commitment that even though caseloads came down we would not reduce staffing.&quot;    Gov. Sununu's program, the Family Incentive Plan (FIP), is voluntary (&quot;we encourage participation very strongly&quot;) and principally involves tying together the federal Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) training programs and counseling with strong placement outreach, but it includes none of the huge additional &quot;incentives&quot; available under ET.    &quot;We do assure AFDC clients that they will keep their Medicaid benefits until they are fully employed with a private health-care program, but not after that,&quot; Gov. Sununu said.    By contrast, Massachusetts not only provides a $1,200 training package, but gives workers up to a year's worth of free day care, with an average annual cost per placement of nearly $2,800. In addition, ET placements get back-to-work clothing allowances, four months of free Medicaid and up to $10 a day travel allowances.    In fiscal 1986, the cost per ET placement exceeded $3,600, and that figure is expected to exceed $4,200 in fiscal 1987. Projecting this onto the U.S. caseload, it would cost at least $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion if it were replicated nationally.    While Massachusetts claims to have placed nearly 40,000 AFDC clients into full-time jobs, its modestly rising AFDC caseloads and soaring new applications suggest those claims are open to question, and probably include many clients who normally would have found work on their own.    Indeed, given its much greater challenges, Michigan has much more to show for its $50 million annual MOST program, with compulsory job training and placement. During the same three-year period as above it cut its basic AFDC caseloads 5%, and new AFDC applications and acceptances fell about 15% and 27% respectively, for a lower-cost (for relative caseload) program that apparently is working in a state with a still relatively high (8%) unemployment level.    The varied experiences in these three states suggest the Presidential Task Force on Welfare Reform was right in wanting to leave this whole issue in the hands of the governors, and not in the more politically charged environment of Congress.    ---   Mr. Brookes, an editorialist for the Detroit News, writes a syndicated column.
