<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-1131 </DOCNO><TEXT>This report is the first of two reports representing the documentationof the project: ''Results from operation and measurements on a groundwater heat-pump test plant'', which is a project in the research programof the Danish Ministry of Energy. The report describes hydrogeologicalinvestigations and the establishment of a ground water heat-pump testplant at The Technical Univesity of Denmark during the years 1983-84.During the construction of the plant, five wells have been drilled atthe test site. Two of these wells have been used for ground water pumpingand recharge, and the remaining three wells have been used for temperatureand water level measurements in the test aquifer. Equipment for datacollection and control was placed in a shed on the test site. The heatpump used for the test runs was a type commonly used in Danish single-familyhouses with a heat output of approx. 10 kW. Reheating of the cooled groundwater was performed by the use of electrical heaters with a rated powerof 24 kW. It is possible to carry out heat and energy balances of theplant, and measure temperatures of the ground water in the aqufer ata limited number of locations. The second report (part 2) describes theresults and experience during the operation of the test plant, includingmeasurements, processing of data, and comparison between the experimentalresults and the theoretical model used for prediction of thermal conditionsin an aquifer used as source of heat for a heat pump. These test runsand the subsequent evaluation of data were carried out during the period1985-1987.</TEXT></DOC>
