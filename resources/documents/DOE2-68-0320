The interest inthe chemical laser is principally for strategic defense. It does nothave application in inertial confinement fusion because it is a longerwavelength laser and it is a CW laser. However, there is synergism withinertial confinement fusion in the technologies that are involved. Thechemical lasers are of interest principally because they provide forself-contained, space-based systems with reactant storage, laser andoptics, all integrated into a single space-based system. With alternativetechnologies, there are system tradeoffs. The comparisons involve ground-basedshort wavelength lasers, with very long range potentialities, but atmosphericeffects, versus the advantages of the space-based HF system delineated.</TEXT></DOC>
