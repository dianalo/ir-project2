(SGI), best known for its high-endgraphics workstations.andP;  Started in 1981, SGI has married two key technologies-- multiprocessor computing and high-performance graphics engines -- thatcould be increasingly important to desktop workstations in the coming years.andM;SGI's machines run IRIX, a proprietary version of Unix that is optimized foruse with graphics workstations equipped with one or more MIPS RISC CPUs.andP;  Inaddition, the machines come with graphics primitive libraries that are anintegral part of SGI's system hardware, and they use silicon geometry&quot;engines&quot; to boost graphics performance.andM;Silicon Graphics' view of multiprocessing computing differs from that ofmulti-CPU suppliers such as Compaq, ALR, Zenith, and Stardent.andP;  Whilecomputers made by such suppliers also run Unix (or other operating systems),they are generally used as servers for low-resolution data entry applicationsor for local area networks.andP;  What makes SGI different is its use of multipleprocessors for single-user and server-based computerized animation, solidmodeling, drafting, molecular modeling, finite element analysis, and othergraphics applications.andM;SGI's multiprocessor workstations and graphics servers are based onsymmetrical processing techniques.andP;  Each processor attacks varioussub-components of the amorphous kernel as a CPU becomes free.andP;  Each kernelsub-component, however, is locked and can be unlocked only by CPUinstructions containing an appropriate software key.andP;  There is a near-linearrelationship between the number of processors and the level of performance,according to SGI systems software product manager Patricia Harrell.andM;Not all of SGI's customers need multiprocessor systems.andP;  In fact, one of thecompany's best sellers is a single-processor workstation: The Personal IRIS.andO;The entry-level Personal IRIS has garnered a respectable market share amongusers of mechanical CAD and similar categories of applications.andM;With performance rivaling that of earlier multiprocessor graphicsworkstations, the Personal IRIS has set new performance standards, accordingto industry analysts.andP;  Although it's equipped with a single CPU, the IRIS isbinary-compatible with more expensive SGI workstations, uses SGI's GLsoftware, and is rapidly becoming the platform of choice for runningvisualization software.andM;Executives at SGI differentiate their workstations from those made by othervendors.andP;  &quot;We're not a 3D computer company; we're a visual processingcomputer company,&quot; says Todd Johnson, director of business marketing at SGI'sentry systems division.andP;  Over the long haul, parts of visualization computers(such as the use of standard graphics libraries, raster engines, graphicsaccelerators, and perhaps limited multiprocessing) will be incorporated inunder-$10,000 desktop workstations, company executives predict.andM;According to Johnson, that day could be right around the corner.andP;  &quot;We believethere will be a convergence in the market for high-end PCs and low-costgraphics workstations in 1991.&quot;andM;Initially, most visualization workstations in this market will be single-CPURISC or Intel Unix-based systems, Johnson believes, and it's likely to beseveral more years before inexpensive multiprocessor machines, priced atabout $10,000, appear.andM;Johnson admits that SGI is examining this market, though.andP;  &quot;The fact that wehave a multiprocessor architecture is important to us...but we haven'tdecided whether or not a multiprocessor Personal IRIS will be a part of our24-month product line.&quot;andM;Should SGI choose to enter this market, the company will not be alone.andP;  Otherpossible entrants could come from Sun Microsystems or other manufacturers ofSPARC-based workstations.andM;THE IRISVISION CARDandM;SGI's efforts to bring visualization software originally written formultiprocessor machines to Intel-based workstations could pay off this year.andO;In late '90, Silicon Graphics made its initial entry in the PC market withthe introduction of the IRISvision add-in cards for ISA- or MCA-based 386 or486 PCs.andM;SGI's PC add-in cards contain the graphics subsystem of the Personal IRIS: aWestern Digital graphics coprocessor, silicon geometry and raster engines,digital-to-analog converters, and other semiconductors.andP;  Most importantly,the IRISvision cards also contain SGI's GL graphics software libraries andcan be used on PCs running SCO Xenix or DOS and Windows 3.0.andM;&quot;Developers of applications that use our GL libraries and that run on otherSGI platforms now have a bridge to PC workstations,&quot; Johnson says.andP;  'Theboards can be used to run software on PCs that are connected to PersonalIRISes, or for stand-alone applications.&quot;andM;Johnson feels that opening up a PC market for such products could challengedevelopers' notions of pricing for applications that run on machines such asSGI's.andP;  &quot;As the price and performance of the PC workstation market changes,developers will be encouraged to bring their products down to the PC level.&quot;andM;Sources close to SGI, however, suggest that IRISvision cards could influencefuture generations of productivity applications, particularly by improvingthe performance and increasing the number of features available to users ofpresentation graphics, CAD, and other programs.andP;  A quick glance at softwaredevelopers seeded by SGI with IRISvision cards could provide a clue to futurePC-based visualization applications.andM;Foremost among those developers are Pixar and Autodesk, Inc., two keycompanies that, along with SGI, believe that visualization -- which requireshigh-performance graphics -- could be important to new PC-based applications.andO;Used on computers running future versions of AutoCAD, products such as theIRISvision cards could be used to create complex color drawings in a fractionof the time now required.andM;All in all, desktop visualization is coming to the personal workstation.andO;SGI's efforts and experience should put it in a primary growth position.andO;Products like the IRISvision board represent a significant change for acompany that has made its reputation building stand-alone and proprietaryworkstations.andP;  By bringing an advanced level of functionality to anIntel-based machine, SGI is recognizing that although engineers may need todo extremely tedious and compute-intensive tasks, they also need to take partin the productivity mainstream of their companies.andP;  By finding ways to mixthose two requirements on a common and standardized platform like thepersonal workstation, SGI is positioning itself well for the '90s.andM;Jim Forbes is a senior editor at Personal Workstation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
