Miners in West Virginia were arrested by thevanload for blocking a bridge.   The incidents came one day after the United Mine Workers unionextended a contractually allowed three-day work stoppage for twomore days.   ``There is a total state of chaos. This state is out ofcontrol,'' said Deborah Herdon, spokeswoman for an A.T. Massey CoalCo. subsidiary in Beckley, W.Va.   The UMW went on strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc. on April5 and wildcat pickets began demonstrations on June 12. By the timethe work stoppage began Monday, at least 37,000 miners were off thejob in eight states.   West Virginia state police went on ``Stage 4'' alert today,meaning troopers were put on round-the-clock duty and had days offcanceled.   Col. Jack Buckalew, state police superintendent, said he issuedthe alert ``to have the manpower available should it be needed''during the stoppage. All 486 troopers were placed on alert.   Herndon said Charles Snavely, president of A.T. Massey subsidiarySidney Coal Co. in Kentucky's Pike County, was hospitalized thismorning after he was hit in the face with a rock.   More than 200 pickets blocked the entrance to Sidney Coal,throwing rocks at cars, state police said. They said one injury wasreported but they had no details. There were no immediate arrests.   In Prenter, W.Va., about 400 UMW members and supporters blocked aroad leading to non-union Elk Run Coal Co. today, saying they wouldnot move until arrested.   More than 30 miners had been arrested before noon, said statepolice spokesman Ric Robinson. ``We're arresting them literally bythe vanload,'' he said.   The protesters are upset with what they say is the constanttraffic by coal trucks over Sand Lick Bridge, which they say has a12-ton weight limit.   Ronald Guthrie, a laid-off miner who lives near the bridge, saidthe empty coal trucks weigh up to 19 tons, and when loaded weigh 70to 80 tons.   Also today, officials at Hampden Coal Co. in Gilbert, W.Va., saidfive of their trucks and a guardhouse at its mine were fired uponWednesday and a fire was started at the mine gate.   In other violence Wednesday, Alabama police said up to six shotswere fired at a coal-loading operation where union miners wereharassing non-union haulers. One shot struck a coal truck but noinjuries were reported, officers said. Near Matewan, W.Va., sixdrivers were injured when roving bands of pickets attacked twoconvoys hauling coal to a subsidiary of A.T. Massey Coal Co., theHerald-Dispatch of Huntington, W.Va., reported. A state policedispatcher told The Associated Press no one authorized to commentwas available.   The union said it extended its sanctioned work stoppage to givePittston an opportunity to respond to Gov. Gerald Baliles' requestto resume negotiations under federal mediation.   But the announcement had little impact at a run-down recreationarea dubbed Camp Solidarity in Carterton, a mining town in southwestWildcat strikers who have been coming here in shifts of severalhundred from Appalachia and the Midwest who said they have no plansto end their walkouts.   ``We're going to continue to show our support until some kind ofsettlement is reached,'' said Bill Wall of West Frankfort, Ill.   In Beckley, W.Va., U.S. District Judge Elizabeth V. Hallanangranted an injunction requested by the National Labor RelationsBoard prohibiting violence and threats by miners that have been onstrike against the New Beckley Mining Corp. since January. Police onTuesday escorted replacement workers from a company mine afterstrikers reportedly threatened to close it by force.   State police Sgt. Mike Frank said troopers made 17 arrests inCarterton. They included a nun who had stopped her medical van infront of a community center on a highway to deliver medicine, unionofficials said.   Sister Bernadette Kenny, who was wearing a camouflage kerchief,was charged with impeding traffic and contempt of court. A federaljudge's order forbids the union to impede coal traffic. She waslater released on bond.   Miss Kenny said that while she supports the union, she neverintended to hinder traffic.   ``I think it's very ironic that Ollie North is let out of jail todo community service and I'm arrested for doing community service,''she said, referring to the former National Security Council aide.</TEXT></DOC>
