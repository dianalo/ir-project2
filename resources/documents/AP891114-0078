WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dissent emerged Tuesday at a Vaticanconference on AIDS, with delegates complaining that no voice wasgiven to victims of the disease themselves.   After negotiations with the president of the conference,Vatican-based Archbishop Fiorenzo Angelini, about 50 delegatesorganized a separate meeting in a side room to discuss their ownagenda for dealing with AIDS.   Many alleged the conference allowed no room for debate orquestions. Some expressed concern that official speakers werefocusing too much on the sexual behavior and drug use that cancause AIDS.   The group included Peter Larkin, a 34-year-old AIDS victim fromLondon.   ``I'm quite distressed as someone with AIDS that this conferencewith so many important speakers does not include one person withAIDS,'' he said. ``I'm being told how and what to think, but I'mnot being asked. We're getting very very angry because we'reignored.''   The group decided to ask conference organizers to let Larkinaddress the three-day meeting, which ends Wednesday with a speechby Pope John Paul II. There was no immediate indication of whetherthe request would be accepted.   Angelini referred to the criticism, telling the conference thatAIDS victims were represented but their confidentiality should berespected.   An Irish priest with the AIDS virus was ejected from theconference Monday when he stood up wearing a sandwich-board withthe slogan ``The Church has AIDS.''   The priest, the Rev. John White, heads an AIDS care centercalled London Lighthouse. He was invited back to the conferenceTuesday by Angelini.   ``No voice was given to people living with AIDS,'' said White,43, who contracted the virus while working as a missionary inKenya. ``It seemed to be a conference where delegates were meant tobe totally passive.''   ``The Berlin Wall is coming down but new walls are coming uphere,'' added Robert Kunst, head of a group called ``Cure AIDSNow'' that supplies meals to AIDS patients in Miami. ``It's beenthe usual focus on gay bashing and abstention in sex. The realissues of care are not being addressed. It's all rubber-stamped.''   The Rev. Carl Meirose, who heads a program for pastoral care ofAIDS victims in Chicago, said, ``This is the worst conference I'veever attended. There is no chance for dialogue or interaction.There is no voice for any voice.''   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, who gave the opening addressMonday, agreed the conference could have been organized differently.   ``I would have included people with hands-on activity, includingpersons with AIDS,'' he told reporters. ``I would also includeperiods of discussion and exchange of ideas.''   Tuesday's official speeches focused less on the high-riskbehavior that can lead to AIDS and more on scientific and medicalquestions.   Edmund Pellegrino, director of the Center for the Advanced Studyof Ethics at Georgetown University, said doctors have a ``moralobligation'' to treat AIDS patients without discrimination. Thosewho refuse should be suspended or have their license revoked, hesaid.   Pellegrino said doctors also have a duty to break the rule ofconfidentiality and advise one spouse if the other spouse has AIDS,with or without the partner's consent.   Wade Parks, head of the pedriatics department at the Universityof Miami, said all pregnant women should be tested for the AIDSvirus just as they are for syphillis.   Parks said most women who give birth to seropositive babies didnot know beforehand that they carried the AIDS virus themselves.</TEXT></DOC>
