A single molecular layer of oxideforms on the aluminum film surface in 1 hour when exposed to a partialpressure of 2 x 10/sup -8/ Torr of either oxygen or water vapor. Thesingle molecular oxide layer that forms in 4 hours on silicon when exposedto 2.5 x 10/sup -8/ Torr of oxygen is SiO/sub 2/ if the vacuum ion gaugesare operating, but it appears to be SiO if these gauges are turned offduring the layer formation. The time of formation of these layers isinversely proportional to pressure. The growth rate of the oxide surfacelayer drops dramatically after formation of this first monolayer on bothaluminum and silicon. Other gases, such as methane and carbon monoxidewere found to be essentially unreactive with the aluminum film.</TEXT></DOC>
