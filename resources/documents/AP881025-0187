Egypt's official Middle East News Agency carried some of thecomments Mitterrand and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt made toreporters before the French leader left for home. Mitterrand arrivedearlier in the day.   Asked whether France would accept the idea of a Palestinian statebased on U.N. Resolution 181, Mitterrand replied: ``I think weshould know much more about this subject before making statements.''   Mubarak cautioned leaders of the Palestine LiberationOrganization against concentrating on Resolution 181 as the key tolegitimatizing a Palestinian state established in Israeli-occupiedArab territories.   ``If we talk about Resolution 181, and we concentrate on it only,this will arouse Israeli suspicion,'' he said, and added about anysuch state: ``We must know the borders, or else the Israelis willfear that it is a state engulfing the whole of Israel and matterswill get more complicated.''   Resolution 181, passed in 1947 by the General Assembly, calledfor division of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states and theinternationalization of Jeruslaem. Israel was created in 1948.   Yasser Arafat's PLO has been studying possible plans for thefuture of Palestinians, including three choices: declaration of anindependent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territories,declaration of a provisional government or a combination of the two.   Israel captured West Bank and Gaza Strip, now home to about 1.5million Palestinians, from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle Eastwar. Egypt, the only Arab nation ever to do so, signed a peacetreaty with Israel in 1979.   Mubarak and Mitterrand last conferred in Paris on Sept. 27,during a European tour by the Egyptian president that includedvisits to Britain, West Germany and Yugoslavia.</TEXT></DOC>
