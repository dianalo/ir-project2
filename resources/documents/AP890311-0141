PUTNAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of miles from the Middle East conflict,a group of Palestinians and Israelis sat down together Saturday tobegin discussions on common goals for peace.   Officials from the PLO, liberal members of Israel's parliamentand a leading representative from the occupied territories joinedwith Arab- and Jewish-American leaders for the symposium at ColumbiaUniversity.   The symposium, sponsored by the Israeli journal New Outlook andthe Palestinian weekly Al Fajr, along with U.S. groups, was based onprinciples including the mutual right to self-determination,renunciation of violence and support for an international peaceconference to include both the Israeli government and the PalestineLiberation Organization.   There was also to be discussion on resolving conflicts, such asthe 15-month uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that hasclaimed the lives of almost 400 Palestinians and 17 Israelis.   While there would be much discussion, there would be nounexpected announcements or concessions, said Nabil Shaath, chairmanof the Political Committee of the Palestine National Council, thelegislative arm of the PLO.   ``There is a lot to do before we are asked again for newconcessions,'' Shaath said Saturday before the meetings began.   The major concession _ the PLO's recognition of the state ofIsrael's right to exist _ has already been made, he said.   Yossi Sarid, a Knesset member in the left-wing Citizens RightsMovement, said that regardless of the outcome ``the success is thevery existence of this meeting.''   Sarid noted polls that show about 55 percent of Israelis supportholding talks with the PLO, yet 90 percent believe the PLO is athreat to Israel. ``The PLO must search its own soul _ why don'tpeople believe it?'' he said.   Also in New York were Knesset members Ran Cohen, Shulamit Aloniand Yair Tsaban. They have parliamentary immunity from an Israelilaw barring Israeli citizens from meeting with PLO officials.   Also scheduled to attend was Faisal Husseini, a top PLO supporterin the occupied lands.   Three Palestinians, Shaath, Noha Tadross, a member of the PLO'sForeign Affairs Department in Tunis, and Afif Safieh, PLOrepresentative to the Netherlands, were granted waivers to a U.S.law that generally prohibits visas to PLO members.   Safieh said the New York meeting was a continuation of a seriesof gatherings, including one in Paris and one in the Hague.</TEXT></DOC>
