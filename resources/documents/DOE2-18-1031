A short description of the Sulzer Brothers (a Swiss engineeringcompany) is used to show the increasing interest in and importance ofnatural gas. Especially because of the theory of Thomas Gold who statesthat the world's gas reserves are many times larger than is believed.In the various sectors of the gas industry (production, transportation,distribution) the engineers can play an important role to make naturalgas more competitive in comparison to other energy resources. They canalso try to find more effective ways in which natural gas can be produced,transported, distributed and used. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
