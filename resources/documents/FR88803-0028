Introduction</ITAG>1.1 BackgroundThe National Bureau of Standards (NBS), Institute for Computer Sciencesand Technology (ICST) is responsible for developing U.S. Government-wideStandards for computer software, hardware, data management, security, networksand related telecommunication systems. The authority for this responsibilityis assigned under the Federal Property and Administrative Services Actof 1949, as amended by Public Law 100-235.ICST develops standards, provides technical assistance, and carries outresearch to advance the effective use of computers by government and industry.ICST works through voluntary industry standards organizations to developstandards that will meet the needs of government users. These standardsare issued as Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) and providethe foundation for compatibility and, where necessary, interoperabilityamong government systems implementing these standards. FIPS also serveas the basis for Government acquisition of commercial off-the-shelf productsand services from competitive sources.The pace of standards development for information systems (informationprocessing and telecommunications) has intensified in recent years, stimulatedby user needs for interconnectivity of hardware, software, and networksystems. These standards are increasingly complex_often describing functionalrequirements and allowing for numerous options in implementation.To achieve interoperability and effective use of information systems, usersneed off-the-shelf products that work together and conform to these emergingstandards. Where products are expected to support complex standards specifications,conformance testing may be required to reduce risks and raise consumerconfidence in information system products.ICST is responsible for organizing, managing, directing and administeringthe FIPS program. Among the responsibilities assigned under the FIPS programis the task of insuring that, for products to be acquired by the FederalGovernment, a mechanism is availiable for determining that these productsconform to the FIPS. In carrying out this task, the ICST develops and maintainsconformance testing programs for the FIPS. These programs require adequatetest methods and procedures, suitable testing laboratories, and a formalacknowledgement of product compliance or noncompliance to FIPS.1.2 PurposeThis document is intended to inform Government agencies, industry, standardsdevelopment bodies, and other interested organizations of the ICST policywith regard to FIPS conformance testing programs.The purpose of this document is to provide a framework for developing uniformGovernment-wide conformance testing programs for FIPS. This common frameworkof policies and procedures serves as the basis upon which the detailedprocedures for a conformance testing program are defined. Some or all ofthe features identified by this framework may be selected where appropriateto meet a FIPS conformance testing need.The FIPS conformance testing program objectives are:<ITAG tagnum="15">_To encourage more effective utilization and management of Governmentstaff by ensuring that skills acquired on one job are transportable toother jobs thereby reducing the costs of staff retraining.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_To reduce the overall information systems costs by making it easierand less expensive to maintain information technology applications andto transfer these applications among different information systems, includingreplacement systems.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_To protect the technical assets and staff time of the Federal Governmentby insuring to the extent possible that products (off-the-shelf or governmentdeveloped) brought into the Federal inventory comply with Government approvedFIPS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_To establish proven test methods and competent testing services forassisting Government agencies in the procurement of industry supplied products.</ITAG>1.3ScopeThe focus of this document is to define policy and procedures related toconformance testing for FIPS. Other types of testing such as performance,acceptance, and quality testing, are not addressed in this document.In determining conformance testing requirements for a given FIPS, a numberof areas are expected to be considered. Among the areas to be consideredare the Government testing needs, test method technology, standard specifications,alternative testing sources (third-party testing, Government testing, self-testing,etc.), and existing accreditation and certification systems.A number of different techniques may be required for testing conformanceto the FIPS. Conformance testing may include the facilities of computerhardware, software or communication networks. Where necessary to assessFIPS conformance, it may include a demonstration of interoperability againsta reference implementation.The validation of information system products as used in this documentapplies to the process of testing and certification of a product that ispurported to conform to the FIPS. These policies and procedures do notaddress the validation and verification (Vandamp;V) associated with the varioussteps of the product development life cycle.Some terms in this document have specific meaning. The Appendix providesa definition of these terms. Whenever these terms are intended to carrythe meaning defined in the Appendix, they will be highlighted in the document.The policy and procedures for conformance testing defined herein applywhenever FIPS standards are required to support Government objectives forinformation systems.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Organizational Model for FIPS Conformance Testing</ITAG>Conformance testing for a FIPS will be accomplished in accordance withthe organizational model described in this section. This organizationalmodel consists of a certification body, testing laboratories and the clients.Each member of this organization shares important responsibilities forassuring compliance of products for conformance to a FIPS. Under the rulesand procedures established by ICST, this model will enable a client tohave his product tested by any ICST recognized testing laboratory; andthe test results produced by that laboratory accepted by ICST as the basisfor issuing a validation certificate to the client. The validation certificateis formal notification by ICST that the product meets the compliance requirementsfor that FIPS.A certification body is established for each FIPS designated to have aconformance testing program. The same basic organizational model is usedfor each conformance testing program. Full implementation or use of allparts of the organizational model depend on the complexity of the standardand the conformance testing needs for that standard.This section identifies the responsibilities for each member involved inthe organization.2.1 FIPS Certification BodyThe Director of ICST provides the overall direction for organizing, managing,directing, the administering the FIPS Certification Body.The Director of ICST is the FIPS Certification Authority for the FIPS conformancetesting program. The Director of ICST:a. Establises and maintains the conformance testing program policies andprocedures,b. Approves the test method used in determining compliance of productsto each FIPS,c. Develop and maintains the validation procedures to be followed by clientsin order to receive a validation certificate.d. Issues a validation certificate based on the results of a test report,e. Establishes the period of time a validation certificate is effective,f. Establishes the accreditation criteria for testing laboratories foreach FIPS, g. Maintains and periodically publishes the official list of products thathave a current validation certificate, h. Coordinates with other certification authorities to review certificationcriteria for the purpose of harmonizing certificates and making provisionsfor mutual recognition of conformance testing.i. Evaluates and resolves disputes on all matters concerning conformancetesting for FIPS, j. Periodically assesses the need for a conformance testing program, maintenanceof a test method or testing laboratory accreditation program, for a FIPS,k. Maintains and publishes lists of testing laboratories recognized byICST to perform FIPS conformance testing, l. Insures that facilities are available to maintain the test method, andto provide assistance to testing laboratories and clients, and m. Establishes the fees or rates for ICST provided products and services.2.2 Testing Laboratories Testing laboratories as used in this document perform conformance testingin accordance with ICST approved validation procedures. Testing laboratoriesmay be commercial laboratories, university laboratories, Federal, Stateor local Government laboratories, or foreign-based laboratories. Only testing laboratories accredited under an ICST approved laboratoryaccreditation program, or testing laboratories under formal agreement withICST shall be recognized by ICST to do FIPS conformance testing. The responsibilities of a testing laboratory are to: a. Obtain and maintain laboratory accreditation as appropriate, b. Conduct conformance testing in accordance with the ICST precribed procedures,c. Prepare a test report in accordance with ICST prescribed proceduresas a result of the testing performed, d. Participate in proficiency testing as required, e. Pay all relevant fees, f. Participate in training sessions or meetings as required by ICST toremain up-to-date of changes to the test method and the validation procedures,g. Provide feedback to ICST on problems and improvements relating to thetest methods and validation procedures. 2.3 Clients Clients are responsible for submitting requests for product validationin accordance with ICST prescribed procedures. The responsibilities ofa client include: a. Providing complete and accurate information to the testing laboratoryand certification body for the performance of the requested validation.b. Submitting information in a timely manner so that the validation processcan be completed in sufficient time to meet the needs of the client. c. Submitting a ``Declaration of Conformance'' as required by the validationprocedures. d. Unless otherwise agreed to by the testing laboratory providing the testfacilities and materials necessary for testing. e. Providing a product in conformity with the FIPS. <ITAG tagnum="84">3. Testing Laboratory Accreditation </ITAG>ICST will carry out its responsibilities for conformance testing throughtesting laboratories judged to be competent to objectively perform thenecessary tests. Laboratory accreditation serves as a basis for determininglaboratory competence. The purpose is to insure that testing facilitiesare available for obtaining an unbiased assessment of products regardingFIPS conformity. Wherever appropriate for a given FIPS, ICST will draw upon the NBS NationalVoluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) as the basis for accreditingtesting laboratories. ICST shall establish technical criteria for laboratoryaccreditation, and provide technical experts for assessing testing laboratorycompetence. The objectives of laboratory accreditation are to: a. Provide objective unbiased testing services, b. Assess and evaluate each testing laboratory accredited to do testingfor conformance to FIPS by: (1) Conducting periodic laboratory proficiency testing to identify testingdeficiencies, (2) Initially, and periodically thereafter, conducting on-site assessmentsto determine compliance with the accreditation criteria, and (3) Conducting visits to verify reported changes in the laboratory's personnel,facilities, and operations, or to explore possible reasons for poor performancein testing practices. c. Insure that the testing laboratory has adequate quality control, facilities,equipment and personnel to conduct testing, d. Determine that the testing laboratory staff is adequately trained inusing the appropriate test method, following the prescribed validationprocedures and is knowledgeable of the criteria for validation certificates,e. Insure that adequate records are maintained to support the testing performedand that test reports are produced to provide the necessary informationfor determining compliance to FIPS, f. Notify the testing laboratory of deficiencies and specifiy requirementsto correct these deficiencies, g. Establish criteria and procedures for testing laboratories to both obtainand maintain accreditation. <ITAG tagnum="85">4. Test Method, Procedures, Reports and Certificates </ITAG>ICST is responsible for providing and implementing conformance testingprograms for FIPS. The key elements of a conformance testing program arethe test method, validation procedures, test report and validation certificate.The following requirements apply when establishing conformance testingprograms for FIPS. 4.1 Conformance Testing Elements <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Test Method </ITAG>1. ICST shall recognize one test method for each FIPS. 2. The test method includes the test suite, support tools, and documentation.a. Test suite shall be designed, where feasible, to be self-checking, modularto allow for testing standard options or levels, and have documented testobjectives for each test. b. The test method shall include support tools where appropriate for controllingand automating the conformance testing process. As a minimum, the followingautomated functions shall be considered: (1) A mechanism for controlling the setup, integrity and systematizingof the test suite for the implementation under test, and (2) A mechanism for automating the evaluation of test results. c. The test method shall include full documentation for the following whereapplicable: (1) Installing and executing the test suite, (2) Evaluating the test resultsfor accuracy and completeness, and (3) Installing and executing the test method support tools. 3. An assessment of the standard and the test suite shall be made to determinewhat parts of the standard are tested by the test suite. The results ofthis assessment shall be documented with the test method. Conversely, thoseareas of the standard that are not tested by the test suite shall be documented.This documentation shall be updated with each new release of the test suite.4. The test method shall be used solely for the purpose of assessing conformanceto the FIPS. The test method should<T3> not</T3> include tests or procedures for assessing other product characteristicssuch as performance (capacities, speed, usefulness, or vendor support),standard refinement, or product quality. If the test method contains testsnot used in determining conformity, then that part of the test method shallbe clearly identified, and those tests shall not be used as the basis forobtaining a validation certificate. 5. ICST shall insure that all test methods are adequately tested beforebeing used as the basis for a validation certificate. 6. Before adoption by ICST, and test method shall undergo a ``field test''period for public review and comment. This public review period allowsICST to assess suitability of the test method for testing conformance toFIPS. Notice of the availability of the test method for review shall beplaced in the<T4> Federal Register</T4>. The public review time period for the test method shall be determined byICST. 7. Test methods shall be accessible and available to all potential usersand interested parties (not unduly restriced from use by manufacturers,academia, government, or other users due to legal considerations or cost).8. For test methods not owned by ICST, ICST shall arrange with the testmethod owner to evaluate, copy, withdraw from and supplement the test methodas necessary to provide for the testing for conformance to FIPS. When changesto the test method are determined necessary, the owner shall be notifiedof the needed changes. Any comments and recommendations resulting fromuse of the test method will be collected and forwarded to the owner ofthe test method for review. 9. Unless otherwise waived by the Director of ICST, provision for maintainingthe test method shall be made before validation use. 10. Test Method Control. When required, ICST shall insure that the test method is properly maintainedfor testing conformance to FIPS, and that this maintenance is coordinatedwith others as needed. The functions associated with control and maintenance of the test methodinclude procedures for: a. Handling challenges to the test method, b. Approving changes to the test method, c. Testing and release of new versions of the test method. d. Reporting test method problems, e. Assisting testing laboratories, clients and others in proper use ofthe test method, and f. Coordinating with the respective standard maintenance committee andothers as appropriate. Where the same test method is used by other certification systems, or itis maintained by an organization other than ICST, ICST will obtain coordinationamong the organizations involved. B. Validation Procedures The validation procedures define the steps and criteria by which FIPS conformancetesting is done in order for a validation certificate to be issued. ICSTspecifies the validation procedures for each conformance testing program.The following requirements apply to validation procedures. 1. Notice of the availablity of new or major revisions to validation proceduresshall be published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> for comments. [A copy shall be sent to DOC GeneralAgreement on Trade and Tariff Secretariat.] 2. The procedures for handling client disputes on the test method or validationprocedures shall be specified. 3. The procedures followed by ICST for interpretation of a FIPS shall bespecified. For software standards, the procedures described in the FIPSPUB 29-2, Interpretation Procedures for Federal Information ProcessingStandards for Software, shall be followed when requesting technical interpretations.4. The steps that the client shall follow in order to have a product testedand to obtain a validation certificate shall be specified. 5. The statements or information that the client provides in a declarationof conformance for receiving a valiation certificate shall be specified.6. Whenever appropriate, the testing, procedures, or information that isrequired in order for the client to have equivalent configurations or maintainedproducts recognized as having validation status shall be specified.C. Test Reports1. The test report shall state the specific environment in which the testingwas done.2. The test report shall indicate all deviations from the standard foundin the product as a result of using the test method.3. The test report shall state all facts and results related to testingof the subject product.4. The test report shall allow for a foreword and statement of disclaimerbased on national requirements, e.g., ``The ICST may make full and freepublic disclosure of the Test Report in accordance with the `Freedom ofInformation Act' (5 U.S.C. 522). The results of this validation are onlyfor the purpose of satisfying United States Government requirements andapply only to the computer system, operating system release and softwareproduct identified in the Test Report. The Test Method is used to determine,insofar as is practical, the degree to which the subject product conformsto the FIPS. Information for this report was provided by the supplier ofthe product. The United States Government does not represent or warrantthat the subject product has no nonconformities to the FIPS other thanthose presented in the Test Report.''5. Test reports that serve as the bases for a validation certificate shallbe available for public review.D. Validation CertificateA validation certificate is formal notification by ICST that the producthas been tested in accordance with ICST prescribed validation procedures,and that the test report indicates product compliance with the FIPS.A validation certificate does not imply or warrant acceptable use of aproduct for any given application, nor does it indicate acceptance of theproduct regarding efficiency or performance. Conformance testing is strictlya means of determining compliance that leads to a judgment of conformitybased on the test method used.A validation certificate is <T3>not </T3>an unequivocal endorsement of complete conformance of a productto the standard or that the subject product has no nonconformities to thestandard, other than those identified by the test method.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Certification Criteria</ITAG>ICST shall provide the criteria for issuing a Certificate of Validation.The certification criteria for a given FIPS may optionally permit a certificateto be issued for implementations that do not pass <T3>all </T3>the test objectives. When the certification criteria allowsfor this type of certificate, a ``Conditional'' Certificate of Validationshall be issued in lieu of a Certificate of Validation. The ``Conditional''Certificate of Validation gives notice to the user of the product thatit was formally tested, but use of the product is conditional on the user'sacceptance of the product with the detected conformance limitations. Thecertification criteria for this type of certificate shall normally requirethe product to be corrected and retested (i.e., satisfy the criteria forreceiving an unconditional Certificate of Validation) within a specifiedperiod of time.The effect of modifications to the product with regard to its certificationstatus shall be specified.When applicable, the criteria for recertification of products shall bespecified, e.g., certificate renewal criteria without retesting may beconsidered if all the following are present:a. No deviations from the standard were found during the last validation;b. The client certifies that there were no changes to the system undertest or implementation under test; andc. There were no changes made to the test method.The validation certificate may include an expiration date when a changeto either the product or the test method could effect product compliance.To keep the certification cycle synchronized with the current version ofthe test method, the certification period and the planned test method releasecycle should be the same (i.e., if the test method release cycle is plannedonce a year, the effective period of the certificate should be no longerthan 12 months).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Certificate Content</ITAG>The validation certificate shall, where appropriate:a. Fully identify the product tested, including version designation whereapplicable.b. Identify the test configuration or test environment (e.g., Hardwareand Operating System) that was used for the conformance testing.c. Identify the standard(s) tested and the applicable portion(s) thereofthat is the basis for the certificate.d. Identify the testing laboratory that performed the testing.e. Identify the test method used.f. Provide an expiration date of the validation certificate.g. Indicate the areas, or degree of nonconformance when a ``Conditional''Certificate of Validation is issued.h. Provide a statement indicating the scope and limitations associatedwith the certificate.4.2 Testing Program Implementation and Administration The following policy applies to implementation and administration of aconformance testing program. a. ICST shall provide for a validation ``trial use'' period to verify theaccuracy and completeness of the validation procedures. During this periodthe full validation process will be performed and evaluated. The experiencegained will be used to refine the test method, validation procedures, andcertification criteria. This experience will also serve as the basis fordevelopment of the technical criteria for accrediting testing laboratories.The number of validations performed to obtain the necessary experienceshall be determined by ICST. Typically, a ``trial use'' period should beused whenever new or major enhancements are made to the test method, ormajor changes are made to the validation procedures. b. Where feasible, test methods owned by ICST shall be deposited with NationalTechnical Information Service (NTIS) for public and Government distribution.c. ICST may assess a fee for the test method to help recover costs of developmentand for enhancement of the test method. d. ICST shall administer testing of products for conformance to the FIPSwhere there is no other suitable means available. e. ICST may require reimbursement of expenses incurred in doing validations.When reimbursement is required, funding for the validation shall be providedbefore ICST begins work on the project. f. For validations performed by ICST, the results of a validation as presentedin the final test report shall be publicly available. If the client specificallyrequests that the testing be held confidential, ICST will <T3>not </T3>disclose information concerning the validation scheduling,testing status or information on preliminary test results. All inquiriesconcerning this information shall be referred to the client. g. ICST may assess a certification fee. The certification fee covers theadministrative cost of evaluating the test report, confirming adherenceto the certification criteria and issuing the validation certificate. Thecertification fee may include a charge for research and maintenance ofthe test method. The amount of this fee is determined by ICST. h. Until ICST approved test method, validation procedures and validationservices are available, government agencies acquiring products and servicesin accordance with FIPS may wish to specify their own testing for conformance.The tests to be administered and the testing organization used are at thediscretion of the agency or agency acquisition authority. <ITAG tagnum="85">5. Recognition of Other Conformance Testing Activities </ITAG>ICST will seek to provide economical and adequate conformance testing forthe FIPS. In meeting this objective, ICST will consider the use of existingtest methods, validation procedures, testing laboratories and certificationsystems. It is not the intent of ICST to duplicate conformance testingactivities where those activities meet ICST requirements. Thus ICST willcoordinate with other organizations to harmonize conformance testing requirements.Recognition of other conformance testing activities may be achieved inmany areas. The possible areas include: a. Test method research and development, b. Testing laboratory (conformance testing services), c. Test method administration (maintenance), d. Validation procedures, e. Tet reports, or f. Certificates. ICST may use any of the following methods for formally recognizing theconformance testing activities of other organizations: a. Bilateral, unilateral or multilateral agreement, b. Contract, c. Accreditation, d. Memorandum of Understanding, or e. Agreement or contract requesting ICST to provide assistance. Any of the above methods is acceptable as long as it does not conflictor compromise ICST's authority in carrying out its responsibilities. Further,the above methods shall not violate any Federal Government regulation.Unless otherwise approved by the Director of ICST, agreements concerningconformance testing shall not: a. Grant exclusive rights to others in fulfilling its responsibilitiesin the areas described above. b. Unilaterally agree to adopt a product or service that conflict with,or that does not allow for changes to meet, ICST requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix</ITAG><T3>Acceptance Testing: </T3>Formal testing conducted to determine whetheror not a system satisfies its acceptance criteria and to enable the customerto determine whether to accept the system.
