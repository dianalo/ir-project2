These systems use scanners for high-densitycoverage of components, and since some of them are mechanized and remotelycontrollable, radiation exposures to personnel can greatly be reduced.The AMAPs is a mechanized scanner developed by EPRI. Digital recordingand processing of data facilitate repetition of stored scan patterns,data logging for data review, and application of signal processing techniquesfor noise reduction.</TEXT></DOC>
