Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPAN </CO><IN> MON PCS CMD FRX </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The dollar rose sharply, drawing concerted intervention by as many as 10 central banks, led by the U.S. and West Germany, to push it back down.    Nonetheless, the U.S. currency stood higher late Monday in New York trading than before the weekend. The U.S. currency rose to 1.8816 marks and 134.58 yen from 1.8750 marks and 134.38 yen late Friday. The pound declined to $1.6713 from $1.6720 before the weekend.    In Tokyo on Tuesday, the dollar opened on the foreign-exchange market at 134.60 yen, down from Monday's close of 134.73 yen.    At one point -- midday in London's trading day -- the dollar advanced as high as 1.8920 marks and 135.00 yen before receding. While other major currencies, except Canada's, also fell against the dollar, yesterday's market clearly focused on the mark, which is both a major reserve currency and the linchpin of the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. The EMS is a joint float of eight European currencies.    Currency dealers said the dollar was trading at just under 1.8900 marks in early afternoon European trading when the Bundesbank and Federal Reserve Bank of New York began selling dollars for marks. They were joined by central banks from Switzerland, France, Britain, Italy, Canada, Austria, Belgium and possibly the Netherlands, according to traders. These other central banks either sold dollars for marks or their own currencies; traders estimated the total intervention at $500 million.    Foreign-exchange traders, in initially pushing the U.S. unit higher, said they were reacting to a vaguely worded communique by the so-called Group of Seven that led them to believe the major industrial nations would tolerate a stronger dollar. On Sunday, finance ministers and central-bank heads from the seven countries departed from three previous declarations by dropping specific warnings that driving the dollar too high or too low or engaging in &quot;excessive fluctuation&quot; would be &quot;counterproductive.&quot;    In Sunday's West Berlin statement, the G-7 -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- reaffirmed their commitment to stable exchange rates. Nonetheless, &quot;people were interpreting the communique to indicate that the U.S., perhaps, and certainly some of the other countries felt the dollar's strength would be fine as long as it didn't surge too far ahead,&quot; said Charles E. Minnaar, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank.    Traders &quot;were disappointed that no one made a firm statement against the dollar or where the range should be,&quot; added Klaus Schuermann, chief mark dealer for Commerzbank in Frankfurt. Traders have long believed that the G-7 countries have agreed to keep the dollar within roughly 1.70 to 1.90 marks, although the central banks have never publicly conceded what their secret target range is.    However, nearly every time in the past year that the dollar has climbed to the 1.90 level, central banks have intervened aggressively or adjusted monetary policy to push it back down.    Also boosting the U.S. currency were conflicting statements by senior West German officials. After German central-bank President Karl Otto Poehl reportedly said the Bundesbank and other central banks would intervene to defend the mark, some news reports quoted Hans Tietmeyer, state secretary in the finance ministry, as contending that intervention wasn't necessary.    &quot;The market had the impression that not much would happen in the next few weeks,&quot; said Roberto Bianchi, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. Thus, he said, &quot;interest-rate differentials became a consideration, especially for those who were forced to finance short {dollar} positions without the potential for gain.&quot;    When traders short a currency -- sell it in advance, betting it will fall and that they can buy it back at a lower rate -- they must finance those positions at current interest rates. With three-month Eurodollar deposit rates at 8.25% and those for marks at 4.88% and Swiss francs at 3.31%, funding a short dollar position can grow increasingly costly.    Others offered more-caustic reasons for the dollar's strength. &quot;Everyone had thought {Vice President George} Bush would make an ass out of himself {in Sunday night's U.S. presidential debate} and he didn't,&quot; said Varick Martin, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. &quot;That was good for the buck.&quot;    Even though the central-bank intervention stemmed the dollar's rise, traders noted that there was still a strong demand for the currency, particularly from U.S. institutional investors seeking to repatriate overseas stock-market and bond-market profits as well as traders wanting to cover short positions. Several traders contended that the dollar would have traded as high as 1.90 marks if it hadn't been for the central banks' selling.    Nonetheless, &quot;the central-bank intervention seemed to be more of a slowing effort than one attempting to drive {the dollar} down,&quot; said Mr. Minnaar of Chase.    Mr. Martin of Manufacturers Hanover said that the central banks might be reluctant to try to definitively cap the dollar's rise, because such an attempt could prove counterproductive.    &quot;If it failed, it might goad the market to push the dollar even higher,&quot; said Mr. Martin. &quot;The man with the stick can lead the elephant as long as the elephant wants to follow. If the elephant doesn't want to follow, then the stick becomes a goad.&quot;    Nevertheless, Mr. Bianchi of UBS argued that the central banks &quot;have the situation under control.&quot; He said trading volumes weren't large enough to allow the market to push the dollar out of its 1.85-to-1.90-mark and 133-to-137-yen range of the past two weeks.    In addition, Mr. Schuermann of Commerzbank believes that the central banks will keep the U.S. currency under 1.90 to 1.92 marks for political and economic reasons. A higher dollar could threaten the progress made this year in narrowing the U.S. trade deficit and reducing correspondingly high West German and Japanese surpluses. Moreover, before the U.S. November election, &quot;nobody wants to cause big problems either on exchange side or with interest rates or the stock market,&quot; said Mr. Schuermann.    Others are more bullish. Mr. Martin of Manufacturers Hanover predicted that the U.S. currency could trade as high as 1.95 to 2.00 marks by year-end or in the first quarter of 1989 and 2.25 to 2.50 marks later in the next year.    &quot;The market seems to believe in the U.S., in the value of the dollar,&quot; he said. &quot;They like our interest rates; there's a growing belief that the dollar is not only undervalued on a PPP {purchasing power parity} basis but that it's due to come back; that the {U.S.} economic numbers continue to look better.&quot;    And if U.S. inflation picks up, Mr. Martin said: &quot;It'll only mean higher interest rates,&quot; which should increase the currency's allure to international investors.    According to purchasing-power-parity theory, a country's currency is in equilibrium with that of another when it can buy the same quantity of internationally traded goods and services in the foreign country as it can domestically. By many measures, the dollar at current exchange rates is undervalued. According to economic theory, currencies will move toward their PPP level, in the absence of policy changes and unanticipated events.    That would indicate a stronger dollar. However, such factors as policy action by G-7 countries to stem the dollar's advance and concerns about the still huge U.S. trade and current-account deficits have interfered with exchange rates drifting smoothly toward their PPP levels.    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $395.20 an ounce, up $1.20. Estimated volume was a moderate 4.1 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $394.75 an ounce.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Monday, Sept. 26, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
