The Little Rock, Ark., savings and loan said that if it is acquired, its shareholders and debt holders probably will lose their investment in the company. The thrift had a negative net worth, or assets minus liabilities, of $144.5 million as of June 30.    First Federal said it believes the Dallas bank intends to try to sell it as a single institution, instead of with a group of savings and loans. It also said the bank is expected to seek investor bids for other Arkansas and Louisiana thrifts.    A spokesman for the Dallas bank couldn't be reached. The bank is the central bank and principal regulator for thrifts in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Mississippi that are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
