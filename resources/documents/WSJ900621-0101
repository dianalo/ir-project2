Berlin, capital of the old Germany, is working hard toprepare to resume its role as the power center of the newnation. But Bonn, West Germany's &quot;temporary&quot; capital since1949, has launched a campaign to hold on to parliament,ministries and foreign embassies.   What's likely to emerge is a compromise, with the head ofstate, whose role is strictly ceremonial, moving to Berlinand the city being made the official capital, while the realseats of power -- the chancellor's office, the parliament andgovernment ministries -- stay in Bonn.   A full move to Berlin by all of Bonn's politicians,bureaucrats, lobbyists, diplomats and journalists could cost,pro-Bonn campaigners say, at least 80 billion marks ($48billion).                                                                                                          APPEAL FROM AFRICA                                                                                                          At a summit of African leaders with French PresidentFrancois Mitterrand, the Africans appealed for Western helpto salvage their shattered economies before they can embracemultiparty democracy. &quot;Africa is suffering more from itseconomy than from its politics,&quot; Togo's President GnassingbeEyadema told Mr. Mitterrand. Evidently in agreement with thatview, Mr. Mitterrand told the French daily Le Monde that &quot;itis for the Africans to decide who rules them and how.&quot;                                                                                                          LATIN AMERICAN HEALTH CRISIS                                                                                                          Some 170 million people in Latin America are denied basicnutrition and health care, and more than 40 million live incritical poverty, a World Health Organization official toldan international conference on &quot;Democracy and Health&quot; inCaracas. The official, Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, said healthconditions in the region had worsened in the 1980s. Althoughthe region spent $45 billion on medical care, an estimated30% of the money was wasted or wrongly spent, he said.                                                                                                          CORRUPTION IN HONG KONG                                                                                                          In a Hong Kong magistrate's court yesterday, CharlesWarwick Reid, former head of the commercial-crime unit of theHong Kong Legal Department, pleaded guilty to corruption. Mr.Reid was charged under the British colony's Prevention ofBribery Ordinance with possession of assets disproportionateto his government pay. The assets cited include 2.4 millionNew Zealand dollars (US$1.4 million) in bank balances andthree tracts of property in his native New Zealand. Theoffense to which Mr. Reid pleaded guilty carries a maximumpenalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of 100,000 Hong Kongdollars (US$12,840).                                                                                                          FRENCH LANGUAGE CHANGES                                                                                                          France's Premier Michel Rocard accepted a report by theHigh Council of the French Language incorporating 15 pages ofrecommended spelling changes. The premier said he will askNational Education Minister Lionel Jospin to assure thechanges are taught in all schools as of next year. Therecommendations indicate the hyphen, much used in French, isall but being discarded. Thus, &quot;cow-boy&quot; and &quot;week-end&quot; --two words borrowed from English -- will under the new rulesbecome &quot;cowboy&quot; and &quot;weekend.&quot;                                                                                                          TOBACCO RESTRICTIONS IN CHINA                                                                                                          China's legislature began deliberating a proposed law thatwould ensure state revenue from tobacco sales and address therisks of smoking. The draft bill would restrict cigaretteimports, ban the sale of cigarettes to teenagers and requireChina's tobacco industry, the largest in the world, to warnthat &quot;smoking is harmful to human health.&quot; Under the proposedlaw, the state would control all tobacco imports and exports.China has an estimated 300 million smokers among its 1.1billion population.                                                                                                          SWISS REFUGEE LAW                                                                                                          The Swiss parliament gave its final approval to morerestrictive immigration legislation.   The new law, effective tomorrow, speeds up screeningprocedures to separate genuine refugees fleeing politicalpersecution from people seeking better living conditions. Ina bid to make Switzerland less attractive to economicmigrants, the law also prohibits asylum seekers from workingfor the first three months of their stay.   Last year, nearly 25,000 people asked Switzerland forrefugee status, while a further 40,000 requests remainedoutstanding from previous years. More than 95% ofapplications processed in 1989 were rejected. Turksconstituted the largest group of asylum seekers, followed bySri Lankans.   Authorities have anticipated there will be at least 32,000applications for refugee status this year. In a country where16% of the 6.7 million inhabitants are foreigners, the influxof immigrants has become a contentious political issue.
