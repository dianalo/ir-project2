Robertson Co. said it agreed to pay a retired Pittsburgh businessman $2 million in cash and $3 million of stock to settle an eight-year-old patent-infringement lawsuit.    Robertson, a construction materials concern, said the settlement would result in a $5 million one-time charge applied to 1986 fourth-quarter results. In the year-ago fourth quarter, Robertson posted a loss of $18.5 million, including a $9 million restructuring charge.    In 1979, E.M. Glaros sued the company over a building-siding patent in a Chicago federal court. Last July an appeals court upheld an earlier jury verdict in Mr. Glaros's favor.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Robertson closed at $14.375, up 37.5 cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
