Money is the main issue in the strategy to be announced early next month. Drug czar Bennett wants to show a sense of urgency by adding $1 billion in antidrug spending next fiscal year to the $6 billion Bush requested earlier. Budget chief Darman sees political benefits, but warns offsetting cuts must be found. &quot;There will be some friction,&quot; one administration official says.    Bennett urges Bush to announce the drug plan in a prime-time TV news conference or a speech. Though some White House aides question such a high-profile stance, one senior adviser says Bush's personal involvement in the drug war is vital because &quot;this is the kind of stuff people are thinking about.&quot; Bush is expected to back Bennett's law-enforcement emphasis, but will hear other views.    A bipartisan group of senators writes Bush urging more federal aid for pregnant drug abusers and their babies.    TURF FIGHTS threaten to undercut the new attack on drugs.    A Bennett proposal for a new anti-drug coordinating body is resisted by the Justice Department and Customs Service. Customs and Drug Enforcement Administration agents sometimes track the same smugglers because the agencies don't inform each other. The failure of the CIA and the Pentagon to share drug intelligence is another problem, law enforcement officials say.    The military is reluctant to give up excess facilities for drug programs. A commission created last month by Bush is supposed to determine which bases could be used in the war on drugs for civilian drug-treatment centers and prisons. But a Pentagon official says the military treats inquiries about surplus space almost as if it were classified information.    HOSTAGE FRUSTRATIONS strain U.S. relations with Israel and Syria.    The U.S. suspects Israel is sharing information on the hostage crisis only when it is to Jerusalem's advantage. Privately, administration officials thanked Sen. Dole for chastising Israel, though they don't blame the terrorists' hanging of Higgins on the Israeli kidnapping of a Lebanese sheik. U.S. Jewish leaders complain that in meetings with them this week, Bush didn't try to distance himself from Dole's criticism.    Syria's claim that it is helpless to use its influence in Lebanon riles U.S. officials. They say Syria's tight control of checkpoints shows it could do more to help with the hostage crisis. One bright spot: A White House official says Bush has been able to use the &quot;non-traditional&quot; diplomacy of getting other countries to relay messages to Iran.    U.S. advisers praise the Soviets. &quot;To their credit, they have passed along the messages {for Iran} that they get from us,&quot; says an official.    MAKE MY DAY: White House aides hint revenge may be in the offing against senators who blocked William Lucas's nomination to head the Justice Department's civil-rights division. One official notes dryly that &quot;the president isn't pleased&quot; and that &quot;at an appropriate time, a political response might be made.&quot;    WHAT ETHICS ISSUES? The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call urges advertisers to reserve early for a September supplement on &quot;What's good about Congress.&quot; In a letter, the paper's ad director writes that lawmakers &quot;have heard a lot this year about what's wrong with the institution. We'll focus on what's right.&quot;    TOUGH DECISION: EPA Chief Reilly isn't worried about a provision in Bush's clean-air bill that could suspend an alternative-fuels program if a recession is likely in the auto model-year three years hence. Reilly says he will simply ask the White House chief economist to predict if there will be a recession in 1993, one year after the next presidential election.    ATTACKING THE WOUNDED: The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, upbraided in Congress for lobbying that helped cause the costly Sandamp;L crisis, faces a new threat. The rival, smaller National Council of Savings Institutions urges industry members to switch to that trade group, saying, &quot;You need a credible voice&quot; in Washington. EUROPE EASES potential obstacles to U.S. business, but worries remain.    Public pressure and quiet diplomacy help avert rules that would have hurt American firms when trade barriers within Europe fall in 1992, U.S. officials say. A proposal to limit the scope of U.S. banks is modified. The Europeans agree to consider U.S. interests in setting product standards.    But Rep. Gejdensen, chairman of the House trade subcommittee, fears that, to avoid restrictions, many U.S. companies simply plan to shift production to Europe. &quot;It may not make any difference to them whether they make it in Norwich, England, or in Norwich, Conn., but it matters to me,&quot; he says. U.S. Trade Representative Hills concedes: &quot;Anxieties may grow again.&quot;    The Europeans have saved some tough decisions for last -- such as local-content rules for automakers.    MINOR MEMOS: Heeeere's, Hashemi] A producer for ABC-TV's &quot;Primetime Live&quot; sent a congratulatory letter to new Iran president Rafsanjani seeking, without success, an interview on the show's premiere last week. . . . Bush, told that some people think he's too nice in dealing with Congress, retorts: &quot;It's a terrible attack. I refute that.&quot;. . . Sandamp;L crisis story? A GAO report &quot;Troubled Thrifts -- The Use of Supervisory Enforcement Actions&quot; is just 12 pages. </TEXT></DOC>
