The National Association of Business Economists said a survey ofits members found them slightly more optimistic about growthprospects for this year than they were three months ago.   But by lopsided numbers, the economists were still predictingthat the most likely date for the start of the next recession was1990.   Three out of four of the economists surveyed expected a newrecession sometime in the next two years. However, the numberpredicting a downturn in 1989 dropped from 40 percent to 19 percentin the latest survey.   Jay Woodworth, president of the association, said that economistswere more optimistic about 1989 in part because of signs that autosales, retail spending and housing construction were holding up evenwith the increase in interest rates.   ``The business economists feel that this expansion is not at theend of its string yet. We probably have another year or so to go,''Woodworth, senior domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. of NewYork, said at a news briefing.   The new survey was taken before the latest round ofcredit-tightening on the part of the Federal Reserve Board. LastFriday, the Fed boosted its discount rate, the interest it chargesto make loans to financial institions, to 7 percent. A hike in thediscount rate is the most dramatic signal the central bank can sendof its intentions to push interest rates higher to dampen anoverheated economy.   The business economists expressed strong support for the Fed'sinflation-fighting battle, with 70 percent expecting the board toboost interest rates further in the next six months.   Woodward said the inflationary pressures, if they do not startreceding, would likely take their toll on the expansion, which hasalready lasted a peacetime record of six years.   ``Inflation rates of 5 percent to 5.25 percent are too high to beconsistent with long-term growth and over time they would send theeconomy into a recession,'' he said.   The median forecast for growth this year, as measured by thegross national product, was 2.7 percent, up slightly from a 2.5percent estimate made by the business economists three months ago.The economy grew at a four-year high of 3.8 percent last year.   The Bush administration has based its first budget on an estimatethat the economy will slow only modestly in 1989 to a growth rate of3.2 percent, but this estimate is about one-half percentage pointhigher than most private forecasters.   The administration is counting on faster growth to bring in morerevenues and help it lower the budget deficit without resorting tohigher taxes.   On the question of interest rates, the business economists seeshort-term rates hitting a peak of 8.5 percent this year and thenbeginning to decline to 7.8 percent by the end of 1989.   The administration is forecasting substantially lower rates forthis year, a projection that also makes the deficit look smaller onpaper because it lowers government borrowing costs.   On other topics, the business economists said:   _Unemployment will show little change this year because of thegenerally sluggish outlook for growth. The jobless rate shouldaverage 5.5 percent for the whole year, up slightly from the 5.4percent unemployment rate recorded in January.   _Inflation will worsen this year with consumer prices climbing by4.8 percent, compared to increases of 4.4 percent in both 1987 and1988.   _The merchandise trade deficit, whicllion last year, will continueimproving but at a slower ratein 1989, falling by 12 percent to $120 billion.   The business economists generally supported Bush's stand that thebudget deficit should be reduced primarily by cutting governmentspending. Only 15 percent of those surveyed said they believed taxincreases should be emphasized over spending cuts although a largergroup said they would be willing to accept a package of taxincreases and spending cuts.   A large majority of economists, 72 percent, singled outreductions in farm subsidies as the most fruitful place to look forsavings, followed by cuts in military spending, favored by 55percent, and reductions in cost-of-living increases fosupported by 47 percentof those surveyed.   On the tax side, 71 percent of economists said they would favoran increase in the gasoline tax followed by 51 percent who saidgovernment user fees should be raised.   The economic projections were based on a survey of 69 economistswho make up the association's economic forecasting panel. Theassessments of budgetary and monetary policy came from a broadersurvey of nearly 300 of the association's members.</TEXT></DOC>
