Big computer buyers led by General Motors Corp. and the federalgovernment demanded such a program because of dissatisfaction withthe existing cacophony in communications between computers. Theseal is called the COS Mark.   The seal was unveiled Tuesday by the McLean, Va.-basedCorporation for Open Systems International, or COS. Theorganization touted the program as a step toward making computers``interoperable'' _ that is, as easy to connect as telephones.   The interoperability of computers, while helpful, does not solvethe problem that programs for one computer still may not run onanother. But it does help with things like sharing electronic mailand data files.   While some basic communications standards have been set,high-level standards that cover things like how information appearson the screen and plugs into programs are still in flux.   General Motors, plagued by incompatible computers in itsfactories, has demanded that computer makers comply with theMap-Top interconnection standard. GM developed that standard, whichhas since been adopted by other users.   The world's biggest computer user, the U.S. government, has itsown interconnection standard, which will be imposed on all would-besuppliers to federal agencies starting Aug. 15, 1990.   The COS Mark seal of approval complies with both thosestandards, the organization said at a Washington news conference.The organization will have a testing program to decide whethercomputers and communication devices deserve its seal of approval,it said.   ``There is no doubt that today's unveiling of the COS Markprogram is one of the most important milestones, not only in COS'history, but in the history of the information services industry aswell,'' Lincoln D. Faurer, the group's president and chiefexecutive, said in a written statement.   ``What they're trying to do is very ambitious. It's hard to setand implement a standard among competitors,'' said Mary Modahl, ananalyst of network strategy at Forrest Research Inc. in Cambridge,Mass.   Achieving interoperability is so difficult that engineers fromcompeting companies may have to sit down together in some cases andwork out problems identified by the COS Mark certifiers, she said.   Products from three companies _ Hewlett-Packard Co., MotorolaInc. and Concord Communications Inc. _ were the first to receivethe COS Mark under a trial certification program.   Statements of support for the COS Mark program were issued byother companies, including Data General Corp., NCR Corp., NorthernTelecom Inc., Unisys Corp., Xerox Corp. and American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.   Also backing the program were such users as GM and the DefenseCommunications Agency.   Easy interoperability is a threat to the world's two biggestcomputer makers, International Business Machines Corp. and DigitalEquipment Corp., which traditionally locked customers into theirown software and communication systems. But even those companieshave been forced to adopt industry-wide standards because of theircustomers' demands.   Representatives of IBM and Digital said Tuesday their companiesare active members of the Corporation for Open Systems and supportthe COS Mark program.</TEXT></DOC>
