<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-0362 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have studied the transition rate from metastable wells in the two-dimensionalpotential of a dc SQUID as a function of applied flux and temperature.We observe a crossover from thermally activated escape to macroscopicquantum tunneling at a flux-dependent temperature. The thermal ratesare significantly suppressed, suggesting that the potential barrier foractivation is effectively enhanced by the interaction of the macroscopicdegrees of freedom in the device.</TEXT></DOC>
