Bush said he would act swiftly to submit a replacement candidateto the Senate, but had no timetable for making a decision. WhiteHouse officials began the process of reviewing other possiblenominees almost immediately.   ``The Senate has made its determination,'' Bush said. ``I respectits role in doing so but disagree with the outcome.''   Bush said Tower should have received ``the recompense of agrateful nation,'' but instead his ``lot in past weeks has been acruel ordeal. For this I am truly sorry for both him and hisfamily.''   Tower's nomination was scuttled by concerns about his drinkinghabits, coupled with senatorial unhappiness that he left hisgovernment post as arms negotiator and quickly began earninghundreds of thousands of dollars as a defense industry consultant.   The vote was the culmination of a tumultuous six-day Senatedebate and closely followed party lines. Howell Heflin of Alabama;Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut were theonly Democrats to support the nomination, and one Republican _ NancyKassebaum of Kansas _ voted against.   At the Pentagon, Tower, who watched the Senate vote ontelevision, appeared briefly in a private dining room reserved forthe defense secretary and read a statement before a TV camera andtwo reporters. He declined to take questions, simply saying ``thankyou'' before he left.   ``I will be recorded as the first Cabinet nominee in the historyof the republic to be rejected in the first 90 days of a presidencyand perhaps be harshly judged,'' he said.   ``But I depart from this place at peace with myself, knowing thatI have given a full measure of devotion to my country.''   He said no other public figure ``has been subjected to such afar-reaching and thorough investigation nor had his human foiblesbared to such intensive and demeaning public scrutiny.''   ``And yet, there is no finding that I have ever breachedestablished legal and ethical standards nor been derelict in myduty,'' he said.   Tower said he would return to private life in Texas but wouldremain ``deeply grateful'' to Bush for his support and ``obliged tomy old colleagues in the Senate who rallied to me with fervor, zealand eloquence in the face of staggering political odds.''   Tower also received a telephone call from Bush, who expressed hisdisappointment with the outcome, Fitzwater said.   Tower, according to Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., had been willingto step aside to allow Bush to select another nominee. ``He offeredto withdraw more than once to the president and the president wouldhave none of it,'' Wilson said.   The Senate rendered its verdict in an atmosphere of unusualformality. Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the session,practically all senators remained in their chairs during the rollcall and the gallery was packed with spectators.   ``We ought to hang our heads after what we've done to this goodman,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said in a finaldefiant speech. ``America has lost a good public servant. Thepresident has won because he stood by his man.''   Majority Leader George Mitchell summed up for opponents, sayingTower's experience and competence on defense issues weren't atissue. But ``serious problems exist'' with conflict of interest and``character integrity,'' he said.   He said, ``I emphasize my strongly held belief that this shouldnot be interpreted as a vote to harm the president,'' butacknowledged that others saw it that way.   Senators of both parties condemned the bitter partisan debatethat consumed the Senate and Mitchell and Dole both said they hopedthere would be no lasting damage.   After the vote, Mitchell and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman ofthe Armed Services Committee, telephoned Bush and expressed theirhope that Congress and the administration ``can work together todeal with the serious problems of the country in a postive andcooperative spirit.''   Bush responded positively, Mitchell said.   But later, some senators, including Dole, said the rancorousbattle would not easily be forgotten.   ``The Democrats decided this man had a mind of his own. Let'sfind someone else,'' Dole said in an interview on CBS News. ``Somesaid it was `Nunn'-partisan. This is going into the memory bank.''   ``A lot of people are going to remembers this one for a long,long time,'' said Wilson.   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, complained that Tower got ``the rawestof deals. Even the American Civil Liberties Union would object tothe way John Tower was treated.''   The rejection of Tower marked only the ninth time in history theSenate has turned down a president's Cabinet nominee, and the firstsuch decision since 1959, when the Senate voted against confirmingPresident Eisenhower's nominee for secretary of commerce, Lewis L.Strauss.   Names most frequently mentioned in White House speculation as areplacement candidate included Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the rankingGOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a formersecretary of the Navy; Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, a member of thecommittee; former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and former Rep.Jack Edwards, R-Ala..   Cohen, questioned after the vote, said he had not heard about thespeculation, and added: ``I'm interested in doing what I'm doingright now.'' And Warner said he has ``indicated very clearly thatI'm going to finish my job as United States senator.''   Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, also wasmentioned but told reporters ``no,'' he was not in line for the post.   The debate drew to an end with the last handful of uncommittedsenators declaring their intentions.   Kassebaum was the only Republican to break ranks with her party.She cited Tower's consulting work for defense contractors shortlyafter he served as an arms control negotiator, saying it raised``very serious concerns'' about his judgment and ``sensitivity tothose major issues of conflict of interest, the role of consultantsand the revolving door.''   Later, Kassebaum said she would have voted for Tower if hers wasthe deciding vote.   ``I had told the president I would have voted for him even thoughI had serious misgivings,'' she said. ``Because at that point Iwouldn't have wanted to be the vote to defeat.''   Another Republican who had indicated he would oppose thenomination, Sen. Larry Pressler of South Dakota, instead announcedhe would vote for Tower.</TEXT></DOC>
