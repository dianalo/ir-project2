Historically, a trial and error approach tomarketing a vehicle was used. The 1970s saw mainframe computers speedthe vehicle design process. In the early 1980s simulating vehicle dynamicsbecame the accepted design procedure. The forcing function used in thistechnique is also its major drawback. This paper summarizes the resultsof one sled vehicle used in a detailed study done at the U. S. Air Force'sHigh Speed Test Track. The study concluded that results from simulationstudies are valid only if an accurate forcing function is used. 6 refs.,14 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
