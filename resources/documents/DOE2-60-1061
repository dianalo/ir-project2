<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-1061 </DOCNO><TEXT>New measurements are presented of the interband absorption edge, in therange 0.01 to 100 cm/sup -1/, for uncompensated n-type InSb obtainedusing a photo-Hall technique. A spectral Urbach edge is observed in therange of sample temperature (20 to 77 K) and it is shown that the formof the experimental results derives from a broadening due to the interactionof acceptor impurity states. A phonon-assisted component is also identifiedat sample temperatures above 40 K.</TEXT></DOC>
