Siegelman, (202) 632-4682.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The FERS Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-335,created a new retirement system for Federal employees. On June 17, 1987,OPM published (52 FR 23013) final rules implementing the death benefitsand employee refund provisions of FERS.Section 8442(b) of title 5, United States Code, provides for payment ofa lump-sum benefit to the widow or widower of a deceased employee. Therules refer to this benefit as the basic employee death benefit. The benefitis equal to 50 percent of the employee's final annual rate of basic pay(or of average pay, if higher), plus $15,000, which is increased by cost-of-livingadjustments. This amendment clarifies the computation of the final annualrate of basic pay for the purpose in the case of an employee with a lessthan full-time tour of duty. For a part-time (regularly scheduled) employee, the final annual rate ofpay will be the basic pay, at the rate in effect immediately before theemployee's death, that is applicable to the employee's tour of duty (or,if higher, the hours in a basic pay status) in a 52-week work year. Forexample, a part-time employee who, at the time of his death, was beingpaid at the annual rate of $30,000, but whose tour of duty was 20 hoursa week, would have a final annual pay rate of $15,000 for purposes of thelump-sum survivor benefit. However, if the same employee actually earnedbasic pay during 1144 hours (averaging 22 hours per week) in the 52-weekwork year, the final annual rate of basic pay would be $16,500.To determine the final annual pay rate of an intermittent (not regularlyscheduled) employee, the employee's final hourly rate of pay will be multipliedby the number of hours he or she worked at basic pay rates (up to fulltime) in the 52-week work year immediately preceding the end of the lastpay period the employee was in a pay status. Intermittent employees donot have a regularly scheduled tour of duty and normally work fewer hoursthan full-time employees. However, these employees have a reasonable expectationthat they would have received some level of income if they could have continuedin Federal service. Therefore, we have arrived at this method of lookingback at the preceding 52-week period to equitably calculate the individual'sfinal annual rate of pay for the purposes of lump-sum survivor benefit.Under section 553 (b)(3)(B) and (d)(3) of title 5, United States Code,I find that good reason exists for waiving the general notice of proposedrulemaking and to make these amendments effective in less than 30 days.These rules are effective immediately to prevent harm to persons entitledto benefits under this part. Delaying rulemaking would be contrary to thepublic interest as expressed in FERS because such a delay could requiredelayed payments to survivors of employees who die while covered by FERS.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant impact on asubstantial number of small entities because the regulation will only affectFederal agencies and retirement payments to retired Government employees,spouses, and former spouses.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Parts 841 and 843</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Disability benefits, Firefighters,Government employees, Income taxes, Law enforcement officers, Pensions,Retirement.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 841_FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM_GENERAL ADMINISTRATION</ITAG>1.

A pay rateother than an annual salary is converted to an annual rate by multiplyingthe prescribed rate by the number of pay units in a 52-week work year. (a) The annual pay of a part-time (regularly scheduled) employee is theproduct of the employee's final hourly rate of pay and the higher of_ (1) The number of hours that the employee was entitled to basic pay whetherin a duty or paid leave status (not to exceed 2000 for Postal employeesor 2080 for non-postal employees) in the 52-week work year immediatelypreceding the end of the last pay period in which the employee was in apay status; or  (2) The number of hours in the employee's regularly scheduled tour of dutyin a 52-week work year.  (b) The annual pay of an intermittent (not regularly scheduled) employeeis the product of the employee's final hourly rate of pay and the numberof hours that the employee was entitled to basic pay whether in a dutyor paid leave status (not to exceed 2000 for Postal employees or 2080 fornon-Postal employees) in the 52-week work year immediately preceding theend of the last pay period in which the employee was in a pay status. (c) If the part-time or intermittent employee's current appointment beganless than 52 weeks prior to the end of the last pay period in which theemployee was in a pay status, the number of hours that the employee wasentitled to basic pay is computed by multiplying the number of hours thatthe employee was paid basic pay by a fraction whose numerator is 52 andwhose denominator is the number of weeks between the date of appointmentand the end of the last pay period in which the employee was in a pay status. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-10388 Filed 5-9-88; 8:45 am]  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6325-01-M   </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
