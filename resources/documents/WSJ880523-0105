Talking about a START agreement, Mr. Reagan told foreign journalists last Thursday, &quot;I think that it is possible that we could have that, yes, while this administration is still here.&quot; Even without a splashy unveiling at the coming Moscow summit, Mr. Reagan and his Secretary of State are still gazing at their places in the arms control history books.    Under consideration, we're told, is a boondoggle called a &quot;declaration of progress and aspirations.&quot; Both the U.S. and the Soviets would announce how many of this or that missile they intend to keep, with details on verification and the like to be worked out later. None of this would bind the Soviets, of course, since it wouldn't be a formal treaty. But given the politics of arms control in Washington, the U.S. declarations quickly would bind an American President. The Soviets would get important concessions, Messrs. Reagan and Shultz would get their arms control &quot;breakthrough,&quot; but the Senate wouldn't even get the chance for formal review.    This idea isn't surprising, of course, from an administration as hellbent on treaties as this one. Secretary of State Shultz recently flew to Geneva, for example, to &quot;resolve ambiguities&quot; over INF verification. The U.S. thought it had the right to inspect small-missile cannisters; that right would keep the Soviets from turning the single missile plant we can inspect into a component factory and building the real missiles elsewhere. The ambiguity was &quot;resolved&quot; more or less by accepting the Soviet position: The U.S. still won't be able to inspect the cannisters.    Similar fudging resolved the dispute over &quot;futuristic&quot; weapons. The two sides agreed that INF outlawed any &quot;warhead, mechanism or device&quot; that can destroy or damage its military targets -- with destroy meaning the target can't be repaired, and damage that it needs to be repaired. The net effect is that, in the name of stopping nuclear war, INF will ban even useful non-nuclear weapons.    One casualty is likely to be &quot;harassment drones,&quot; which fly over an enemy radar, force it to turn on, then crash into it. The Israelis used similar drones to great effect in discovering Syrian radars, and ultimately wiping out Syria's air force with conventional arms. In other words, these drones are highly useful to the side (us) with a better air force trying to stop the side (them) with more tanks. Even ignoring that the Soviets will go ahead and build these drones despite the treaty, the episode shows how nuclear arms control also impedes our conventional defense.    This isn't life-threatening in a modest treaty like INF, but in some open-ended &quot;declaration of progress and aspirations&quot; on START it certainly could be. The prime examples are cruise missiles, which within a few years will be so accurate they could destroy major Soviet targets even with conventional warheads.    The U.S. Joint Chiefs agreed to give up ground-launched cruise missiles under INF, but only if there'd be no concessions on sea-launched cruises under START. Under pressure from the Soviets, however, some in the State Department now want to jump through hoops to limit air- and sea-launched cruises too.    One egghead idea would have the two sides rivet shut the bomb-bay doors on planes that carry cruises. Why? So neither side can swap nuclear-armed cruises for conventionally armed ones, as if this would really restrict either side. Another starburst would have the U.S. identify which ships or planes carry nuclear cruises -- even on platforms using stealth technology. In other words, the U.S. would tell the Soviets the whereabouts of a weapon that was expressly designed to be concealed from the Soviets.    Just as disturbing is how little thought the Administration has given to U.S. defense needs in the wake of any START accord. If we limit our submarine ballistic missiles, should we build a new smaller sub to better disperse what remains? Will deterrence work in a world with fewer missiles and an operating Soviet anti-missile defense? If reducing the risk of nuclear weapons is our goal, shouldn't we build more conventional cruise missiles rather than limit them? Questions like these aren't even being asked, lest they interfere with the rush to agreement.    A decade ago President Reagan criticized an arms control treaty as &quot;fatally flawed,&quot; but today he pursues his own more radical accord with an enthusiasm that would impress even Jimmy Carter. Astrology is hardly the worst kind of star-gazing going on in the White House. </TEXT></DOC>
