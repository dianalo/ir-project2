Higher taxes, Mr. Brady and Co.apparently feel, won't cause so serious a political backlashif voters can be persuaded that those taxes are part of abudget deal leading to lower interest rates. Yesterday, FedChairman Alan Greenspan allowed that the Fed might act to&quot;offset&quot; the alleged credit crunch. It's hard to read Mr.Greenspan's mind. But it is possible that he is using thecredit crunch as an excuse to lower interest rates withoutappearing to knuckle under political pressure.   If that's what happening, it is wrong. Politicalmanipulation of monetary policy might indeed seem to yieldshort-term positive results. But long-term costs areenormous. The drop in interest rates would be engineered byinflating the money supply -- a move that will eventuallypush interest rates and prices higher.</LP><TEXT>   Politically motivated efforts to lower interest rates aredoomed to failure. An easy-money policy could temporarilylower rates by flooding credit markets with new funds, butthere would certainly be a rebound as reality and the laws ofeconomics hit home. In other words, interest rates would risebecause lenders would be forced to add an &quot;inflation premium&quot;-- extra percentage points of interest to compensate them forthe devaluation of their capital -- to the rate they chargeborrowers. An easy-money policy designed to lower rates willultimately result in higher rates.   In fact, long-term interest rates would probably riseright away, since those rates are sensitive to expectedinflation -- and largely immune to credit-marketmanipulation.   On financial markets, artificially lower interest ratesmay result in temporary increases in stock prices, asinvestors shift assets from bonds and certificates of depositto equities. But markets also will eventually be hurt.Periods of inflation are almost always followed by economicdownturns; 1982 is the most recent example.   The best way to ensure lower interest rates is toeliminate inflation. It's no accident that countries withvery low interest rates, such as Switzerland, Japan and WestGermany, also have strong records of price stability, whilenations that follow easy-money policies, as the U.S. did inthe late 1970s, have high interest rates.   Some budget-summit supporters claim that big tax increasesreally will lower interest rates because a smaller deficitreduces government borrowing. While intuitively appealing,this assertion is hard to support. It is almost a foregoneconclusion that Congress will spend any additional money itcan extract from taxpayers -- rather than use it for deficitreduction. But even if it doesn't spend revenues, therelationship between the deficit and interest rates is notwhat conventional wisdom suggests.   Look at some shifts from the past decade: In 1982, theprime rate was 14.86%, down from 18.87% in 1981. The deficittraveled in the opposite direction. As a percentage of grossnational product, the deficit rose to 4.1% in 1982 from 2.6%in 1981. In 1985 the prime rate was 9.93%, down from 12.04%in 1984. In the same period, the deficit grew to 5.4% from 5%of GNP.   Most advocates of higher taxes probably realize that abudget deal, by itself, would neither boost financial marketsnor lower interest rates. The politicians must realize, too,that unless they can create the illusion that a budgetagreement has resulted in something positive, they will havea hard time persuading voters that a tax hike accomplishesmore than giving Congress money to spend. This is whyparticipants in the budget summit desperately want the Fed togive them a reason to justify higher taxes.   Pursuing irresponsible monetary policy to rescue badfiscal policy is like using gasoline to put out a fire. If itdoesn't blow up in your face, it will at least make thingsworse.   ---   Mr. Mitchell is a research fellow at the HeritageFoundation in Washington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
