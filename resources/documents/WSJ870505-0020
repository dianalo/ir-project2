But six months later, with two major investigations of the affair completed and congressional committees about to open hearings today, investigators still lack a full understanding of the money trail that snaked from the Middle East to Asia to Nicaragua and Europe and possibly to the White House.    It appears that more than $50 million in covert funds was raised to aid the Contras from 1984 through 1986. But that figure is highly uncertain; it is even less certain just what became of the money. So tracing the flow of funds through a maze of middlemen, bank accounts, dummy companies and secretive countries will be one of the toughest challenges before the House and Senate committees.    The committees have received bank records and other evidence that wasn't available to previous investigators, and Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.) said last night on public television's &quot;MacNeil/ Lehrer NewsHour&quot; that those &quot;breakthroughs&quot; will allow the committees to do &quot;a good job&quot; in &quot;tracing the money.&quot; But Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), chairman of the Senate panel, says: &quot;I don't think we'll ever be able to relate to the people of the United States the complete money trail.&quot;    The hearings are likely to get quickly into the money trail because the lead witness, retired Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, was deeply involved in it. Gen. Secord handled logistics of both the Contra arms supply operation and portions of the Iran arms sales. He was the business partner of Albert Hakim, the man who controlled some of the Swiss bank accounts through which the funds flowed. And Contra leader Adolfo Calero has said the rebels paid Gen. Secord $9 million for arms he supplied.    There are three large pools of funds involved in the scandal: private U.S. money raised since at least 1984, when the U.S. government terminated military aid for the Contras; funds raised from friendly foreign governments for the Contras during the same period; and money received from the secret sale of arms to Iran starting in 1985, some of which was diverted to the Contras.    The Senate Intelligence Committee and the Tower Commission both shed some light on the money trail but conceded that they lacked the time or resources to clear up the money mystery. Then too, these earlier investigators focused almost wholly on the Iran arms sale proceeds, profits from which were diverted to the Contras.    Investigators believe that on both the Iran and Contra ends, millions of dollars of funds involved in the scandal may have been skimmed off for profits, commissions and kickbacks -- although there isn't any evidence that this happened. Still, Iranian officials are suspected of receiving some of the money, as are arms middlemen such as Manucher Ghorbanifar and Jacob Nimrodi. Investigators are looking into whether Gen. Secord, others who bought arms for the Contras, or Contra leaders themselves kept any funds. And Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh is studying whether any U.S. officials were enriched. All the figures involved strongly deny stealing any money.    Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), vice chairman of the special Senate panel, hinted Sunday of massive skimming. Speaking on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; he said: &quot;The evidence I think will show that of the total amount of money raised from private sources, and from profits or increases in markup, if you will, on the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran, that a relatively small percentage of that money went to the Contras. I'll let Gen. Secord explain for himself, and other witnesses, what they believe the rest of the money went for.&quot;    Likewise, Sen. Rudman and Sen. Inouye said a $10 million donation to the Contras from the Sultan of Brunei is still unaccounted for. &quot;You can get a finder's fee for that,&quot; Sen. Inouye said on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;    The special congressional panels and Special Prosecutor Walsh, armed with subpoena powers, some bank records and the testimony of some principals, may be able to provide a more complete map of the money trail and, indeed, there have been some recent breakthroughs.    After receiving Swiss bank records last month from Albert Hakim, a strategic player in the scandal, congressional committee leaders said they believed they would be able to trace &quot;most&quot; of the Iran arms sales funds, including whatever amounts were diverted to the Contras. But the committees haven't expressed the same confidence about tracing the other monies raised with White House help to aid the Contras.    Likewise, last week Carl Channell, a conservative fund-raiser, pleaded guilty to charges he defrauded the government by soliciting $2 million for Contra arms on the false promise it was a tax-free contribution. But Mr. Channell appears so far to have handled only a small share of the funds raised with White House help to arm the rebels.    So far, it seems clear that for at least two years Lt. Col. Oliver North was administering tens of millions of dollars in secret, non-U.S. government funds for the White House, and that the aim of the money flow was to arm the Contras.    But it also seems clear that the Iran arms funds, though they dominated early investigations, were only incidental in the covert money machine -- amounting to considerably less than $10 million, according to congressional investigators, and probably paid in the form of arms and shipping, not cash.    Another source of the Contra funding that received early attention was private fund-raising in the U.S. by right-wing figures such as Mr. Channell and retired Maj. Gen. John Singlaub. It isn't known how much was raised, but based on what's known now, it seems to have been a relatively small share of the total.    The biggest source of the funds overseen by Col. North appears to have been payments by friendly foreign countries, especially Saudi Arabia. Investigators believe the Saudis gave about $30 million to the Contras, at the behest of the U.S., after Congress cut off official military aid. The Saudi payments began at $1 million a month in mid-1984, then increased sharply in early 1985 to total about $30 million. Contra officials, while denying they knew the Saudis were the source, confirm a similar pattern of deposits to offshore accounts they controlled.    It isn't known whether Saudi Arabia received any favors from the White House in return, although there have been reports that the Saudi policy can be traced to the 1981 sale of American radar planes to the kingdom, and that the two countries have maintained a secret agreement covering funding of covert operations.    In addition to Saudi Arabia, Brunei came up with $10 million for the Contras -- although the State Department now sheepishly claims it lost track of the gift -- and Taiwan and South Korea, or individuals in those nations, apparently were solicited for funds by Gen. Singlaub and others. It isn't known how much, if anything, Taiwan or South Korea provided.    Clearing up all this won't be easy because the covert funding network appears to have been devised to obscure the source and destination of the money it took in. Indeed, a hand-drawn chart, apparently of the Contra funding system, found by the Tower Commission staff in the office of Col. North, perhaps illustrates the investigators' problem.    Untitled, it contained 23 little boxes labeled with the initials of various organizations and front companies in the U.S. and abroad. The boxes are connected by dotted lines and grouped into three categories: &quot;Resource Development,&quot; &quot;Financial Mgt.&quot; and &quot;OP Arms.&quot;    Investigators and reporters have been able to untangle only parts of the network, and even explaining these pieces is no easy matter. Last month, for instance, this newspaper described how more than $1.5 million -- only a fraction of the total sum involved -- was pumped into the secret airlift to bring arms to the Contras. First a Swiss company transferred funds through New York to a bank in Panama using the names of two Panamanian front companies. The money was deposited in a Panama bank in the name of still another shell company, which in turn was owned by Southern Air Transport, whose planes were used in both the Iran and Contra transfers. The shell company then sent the funds back through New York to banks in Canada and Pennsylvania to cover the cost of aircraft or the salaries of pilots.    Perhaps the most bizarre incident involving the money controlled by Col. North was told to the Los Angeles Times by White House aides. One day in 1984, they said, Col. North opened a safe in his office and revealed to co-workers what he said was $1 million awaiting transfer to the Contras. The Times reported that one witness to the event declared that the colonel's cache &quot;was more money than I've ever seen in one place in my entire life.&quot;    ---                  Covert Contra Funding   Here is a rough breakdown, based on press reports andearly investigations, of the main sources of covert fundsraised for the Contra rebels from mid-1984 through 1986.
