The interactionbetween the magnetic field and the convection close to the solar surfaceis modeled by considering the behavior of an imposed vertical field ina superadiabatic, or convectively unstable, atmosphere. The tendencyfor such large active regions as sunspots to occur in bipolar pairs evincesa strong underlying toroidal magnetic field bursting through the surface.125 references.</TEXT></DOC>
