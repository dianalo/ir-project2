Hurt, who married someone else in March, is estimated by theplantiff's lawyer to be worth about $10 million.   Sandra Jennings, 32, is basing her claim on four weeks that shelived with Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., while he was filming ``The BigChill.'' South Carolina recognizes common-law marriages, while NewYork, where they lived most of the time, does not.   ``This is a divorce action,'' said Jennings' lawyer, A. RichardGolub. ``I want to establish the marriage, and then I think sheshould get half of everything he earned from 1982'' to when they aredivorced.   Jennings, a former dancer at the New York City Ballet, said Hurt,39, treated her _ and introduced her to others _ as his wife. Butthe judge who is hearing the case beginning Monday has already saidthat the burden of proving that there was a common-law marriage,based on South Carolina law, will be difficult.   Hurt's lawyer, Frances Jacobs, would not comment, referringquestions to publicist Lois Smith, who denied a common-law marriageexisted. Hurt ``never claimed or pretended they were married,'' shesaid.   Hurt, who also has starred in ``Kiss of the Spider Woman,''``Broadcast News,'' ``Gorky Park,'' and ``The Accidental Tourist,''lived with Jennings for several months in South Carolina whileshooting ``The Big Chill,'' Jennings says. For most of that time hewas still married to actress Mary Beth Hurt.   The actress divorced Hurt on Dec. 3, 1982, after seven years ofmarriage. Hurt learned of it on Dec. 9. Jennings is basing hermarriage claim on the period from Dec. 9 to Jan. 10, 1983, the daythey left Beaufort. At the time, Jennings says, she was pregnantwith Hurt's son.   Jennings said she gave birth to Alexander Devon Hurt, now 6,because she thought her relationship with Hurt was permanent. Incourt papers, she said she left Hurt in 1984 because he wasphysically and verbally abusive, claiming he once slapped her whileshe held their then-5-day-old son. On another occasion, after adrinking binge, she says, he urinated on their couch.   Smith said Hurt was treated for alcohol abuse at the Betty FordClinic and has been a member of Alcoholics Anonymous for about 2{years. She denied that Hurt ever hit Jennings.   Jennings aborted two pregnancies before giving birth to Alex,Golub told State Supreme Court Justice Jacqueline Silbermann at arecent hearing.   Hurt acknowledged he is Alex's father and has been givingJennings $65,000 a year for support, Smith said.   Jennings sued last year to get $16,000, a month claiming she andher child were living in near poverty. She later decided to arguethat a legal marriage existed under South Carolina law.   Until the marriage issue can be decided, Silbermann refused togive Jennings temporary alimony or child support, ruling that$65,000 a year seemed adequate.   Silbermann also noted that South Carolina does not automaticallyregard two people living together as having a common-law marriage,especially where one of them is already married.   She said that if the relationship was illicit at its inception,the law presumes the relationship retains its illicit character. Theperson who claims a common-law marriage exists must prove it,Silbermann said.   ``The evidence is therefore thin, complicating a heavy burden ofproof under South Carolina law,'' the judge said.   Golub says he intends to call Hurt as his first witness Mondaywhen the hearing starts on whether the actor and Jennings aremarried.   Hurt moved actress Marlee Matlin, his costar in ``Children of aLesser God,'' into his Manhattan apartment in November 1985 andJennings said in court papers that this caused her ``great emotionaldistress.'' She said her name was still on the apartment mailbox atthe time.   Hurt married Heidi Henderson, band leader Skitch Henderson'sdaughter, in March.   Golub's position is that the blond, bespectacled Hurt ``is abigamist because he got married while he is already married to myclient.''</TEXT></DOC>
