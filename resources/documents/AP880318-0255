MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government controlled by Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega declared a state of emergency throughoutPanama Friday, but the opposition responded with a call for anindefinite general strike.   The emergency decree appeared aimed at forcing reopening ofbanks and other businesses, closed for three weeks during aneconomic and political crisis that has brought Panama to the brinkof bankruptcy.   In Washington, sources in the Reagan administration said WilliamWalker, a deputy assistant secretary of state for Latin Americanaffairs, had gone to Panama to discuss possible terms for themilitary strongman's departure.   One official, who spoke on condition he remain anonymous, saidWalker would tell Noriega the United States will not seek hisextradition on drug trafficking charges if he seeks asylum in athird country. Noriega says he is innocent of all charges.   Spain has been mentioned as a possible place of refuge forNoriega.   Friday's emergency decree, technically called a ``state ofurgency'' by Panama's Constitution, permits the government tosuspend a wide range of civil liberties, including freedom ofspeech and assembly and the right to private property. It was seen,however, more as a maneuver to get the banks to reopen.   The National Civic Crusade, a coalition of opposition groupsseeking Noriega's ouster, said it was calling a general strike asof Monday ``to put a halt to the catastrophic national situation.''   Aurelio Barria, foremost leader of the Crusade, alsoacknowledged receiving a message from Noriega through a third partyseeking ``a Panamanian solution'' to the crisis.   He and other Crusade leaders declined to give details. They saidthey would not negotiate with Noriega ``because he is a liar andcannot be trusted.''   Panama's nominal civilian chief of state, Manuel Solis Palma,said Friday the government declared the emergency because ``thereis a real situation of undeclared war'' against Panama by theUnited States and by political foes at home.   The emergency does not automatically suspend civil rights, butgives the government the right to do so by decree. A governmentspokesman said measures to implement Friday's decree ``will followin due time.''   Luis H. Moreno, a former member of the National BankingCommission, said he was sure the emergency was aimed at forcingreopening of the 118 foreign and locally owned banks that makePanama a major financial center.   He told The Associated Press, ``I think that's the only reasonfor the decree.''   The communique said, ``Panama is the object of an attack on itseconomy by the United States in coordination with nationalpolitical groups desperate to grab the government by force.''   In other developments Friday:   _Angry dockworkers moved huge blockades across the entrance toBalboa port near the Panama Canal to fight off an army takeover bytroops loyal to Noriega.   _Noriega fired his intelligence chief and four other officers inan apparent purge of his fractured Defense Forces, two days after acoup attempt against him failed.   _The Pentagon said Panamanian authorities arrested four U.S.military police officers in the capital and held them severalhours. The newspaper Critica said the Americans were carryinghandguns and ``military implements'' when detained in an area``where daily activities disturbing the public order'' had occurred.   The government blamed the closing of the banks on the``arbitrary freezing of funds of the National Bank of Panama'' ondeposit in the United States.   About $50 million in official Panamanian funds have been tied upin legal actions brought by attorneys for Eric Arturo Delvalle, whowas deposed as president by Noriega Feb. 26. Delvalle, ousted afterhe tried to fire Noriega, still is recognized as president by theUnited States.   The United States has cut off all economic and military aid toPanama and applied other economic sanctions, including withholdingof $6.5 million in monthly Panama Canal fees due this week.   Panama was last under a state of emergency less than a year ago.   It decreed that emergency on June 10 after the government's foesstaged demonstrations aimed at Noriega's ouster. It was lifted onJune 29.   The next day, a pro-Noriega mob attacked the U.S. Embassy inPanama City, stoning it and splashing it with red paint as policestood by.   Under the state of emergency, the government can jail citizensindefinitely without formal charge, search their homes withoutwarrants, open their mail and restrict their travel.   Moreno said bankers and the banking commission have been tryingfor more than two weeks to reach agreement on a plan to reopen thebanks, which were closed by a government order March 3. Many closedtheir doors days earlier fearing a run on deposits.   ``The problem is one of lack of confidence ...,'' Moreno said.``If the government forces the banks to reopen, the banks will nothave enough cash to cover the demand for withdrawals.''   Friday's communique also blamed Panamanian business groups forthe economic crisis, accusing them of hoarding currency, closingshops and raising prices.   In Washington, an administration official, speaking on conditionof anonymity, said two Panamanian pilots defected to the UnitedStates Thursday. He also said Noriega received military equipmentfrom Cuba and money from Libya recently. He presented no evidenceand the report could not be confirmed.   The failure of the cash-starved Panamanian government to pay itsworkers has led to violent demonstrations.   Panamanians lined up at public parks and pay stations Friday toreceive partial payment and bags of food from the government.   At Balboa Port, about a mile outside the Panama Canal, about 300striking dockworkers moved car-sized containers across the portentrance to battle an army takeover ordered Thursday by thegovernment. The men are demanding to get paid.   No vehicles or machinery were passing in or out.   Ports at Panama City and Colon closed Monday when dockworkersstruck. The Panama Canal Commission said the shutdowns had noeffect on its operations.   The military was also ordered to take over electrical, water andtelephone companies, airports, and several government ministries,all struck by workers demanding salaries.   In firing the five officers Friday, Noriega gave no reason.   Col. Bernardo Barrera had been in charge of intelligence for the15,000-member Defense Forces, which includes Panama's military andpolice.   A source close to the Defense Forces said Barrera might havebeen faulted for not knowing in advance of Wednesday's coup attempt.   The four American military police arrested Thursday night inPanama City were identified by Critica as Danny H. Feltro, WilliamJerry, Virts Richard and Tammy Markley.   Francisco Artola, vice president of the opposition NationalAuthentic Party, said his radio station in Changuinola, Bocas delToro province, was raided and closed Friday by Defense Force guards.</TEXT></DOC>
