WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Gray party, a new color on WestGermany's ever-expanding political palette, aims to unify 14 millionsenior citizens and poses yet another threat to the beleagueredparty of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   Nearly one in three West German voters is 65, and as lifeexpectancy grows and the birth rate declines, they promise toaccount for a hefty share of the electorate for years to come.   Growing concerns over the future of the nation's elaborate socialsecurity network and discontent with the established partiesprompted the West German Gray Panthers to form their own politicalparty last month.   Falling in with the national penchant for adopting a color tosymbolize the party, the new political force of age advocates haslabeled itself the Grays.   Trude Unruh, national chairman of the new party and the GrayPanthers chapter, said the Grays already have 1,000 registeredmembers and 3,000 other letters have arrived over the past fourweeks that she hasn't had time to open.   ``Since we made the decision to represent ourselves, thereception has been tremendous, as much among the young as the old,''she said.   For the past four years, affairs of the elderly have beenincluded in the platform of the environmentalist Greens, and Mrs.Unruh has served as a member of the federal Bundestag parliamentunder the Greens umbrella.   But the Greens refused to guarantee senior citizens a fixed shareof their parliamentary seats as it has set a 50 percent quota forwomen representatives, so the Gray Panther faction broke off fromthe leftists in early July.   ``We tried to negotiate this with the Greens for 10 months andgot nowhere,'' the 64-year-old party leader said. ``We no longerhave confidence that our interests are represented by theestablished parties.''   The Grays are still a fledgling party and will require months oforganizational work and campaigning before gaining a voice in WestGerman state affairs, Mrs. Unruh acknowledged. But she said theparty would run candidates in the December 1990 national electionsand expected to get at least the 5 percent of the vote needed to beseated in parliament.   A recent public opinion poll commissioned by Stern magazineshowed the Grays with 6.5 percent of the vote. That would be morethan enough to earn it a small voice in federal affairs and thepossible role of kingmaker in determining the fortunes of the twobiggest parties.   Smaller parties like the Grays, the Greens, the liberal FreeDemocrats, symbolized by yellow, and the ultra-rightist Republicansfounded earlier this year have been drawing voters from Kohl'sconservative Christian Democratic Union and the left-leaning SocialDemocratic Party (SPD).   Neither of the leading parties has more than 40 percent of thevote, so both the CDU and the out-of-power SPD are consideringvarious alignments with smaller parties to win at least 50 percentof the vote next year.   Berlin's 2 million residents have been governed since March by acoalition of environmentalists and Social Democrats, signified byred. Many expect a national red-green coalition to be offered tovoters next year, or a ``stoplight'' coalition that would alsoinclude the Free Democrats.   Mrs. Unruh said her party could not be easily cast into a left-orright-wing category, but acknowledged that many members support theSPD leader Hans-Jochen Vogel and that the Grays might add theircolor to that rainbow.   The Grays do not plan to run their own candidate for chancellor,she said.   Mrs. Unruh said her party in no way supports the anti-foreignersentiments gaining ground in West Germany, but that older citizensare worried about the burden the new arrivals are placing on asocial security system already threatened by a declining pool ofyounger wage earners.   ``These calls of `Foreigners Out' are absolute rubbish,'' shesaid, ``But neither should foreigners and refugees have rights andprivileges that exceed those of other citizens.''   East German refugees and ethnic Germans arriving from other EastEuropean countries qualify for immediate public assistance, whilepensions and benefits for West Germans are based on their workingyears and contributions.   ``These are the kind of issues we must address,'' Mrs. Unruhsaid, ``and we want the older generation to have an influence.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 24</NOTE></DOC>
