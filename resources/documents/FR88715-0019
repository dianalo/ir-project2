Thisstatute requires publication for public comment at least 30 days beforethey may take effect of procurement policies, regulations, procedures,and forms (including amendments or modifications thereto) relating to theexpenditure of appropriated funds that have either a significant effectbeyond the internal operating procedures of the agency issuing the procurementpolicy, regulation, procedure, or form, or a significant cost or administrativeimpact on contractors or offerors. (1) The statute does not delineate those policies and procedures that willhave a significant effect beyond the internal operating procedures of theagency or have a significant cost or administrative impact. Examples ofpolicies or procedures that fall in either of these categories are givenin (b)(1) (i) through (iv) below. This list is not all inclusive and doesnot prohibit the agency from publicizing a policy or procedure that doesnot fall within one of the categories mandated by the statute. (i) A contract clause requiring contractors to take precautions to avoidinjury to Florida manatees, which have been designated as an endangeredspecies, has a significant cost impact for contractors who must obtainprotective devices for boat propellers and take other safety actions. (ii) A contract clause requiring contractors to follow the Government'sholiday schedule, thereby disallowing premium pay for work on contractor-designatedholidays, will have an effect outside the internal operating proceduresof the agency. (iii) A contract clause requiring contractors to segregate costs by appropriationswill affect the contractor's internal accounting system and have a significantimpact. (iv) Requiring contractor compliance with NASA's Space Transportation SystemPersonnel Reliability Program will have an effect outside the internaloperating procedures of the agency. (2) In contrast, the following would not have to be publicized for publiccomment: (i) Security procedures for identifying and badging contractor personnelto obtain general access at a NASA installation.

Procurement documentsthat may require Headquarters approval will be held in abeyance until receiptof the notification required by 1807.7103-3 (a) or (b).
