Rapid population growth andeconomic development activities have created a need for additional electricalcapacity to be available by 1992. In order to increase the efficiencyof energy use and expand the use of renewable resources, the Governor'sEnergy Office (GEO) created an extensive cogeneration and small powerproduction promotion program. The Cogeneration Analysis Service (CAS)implemented by the GEO provides an ever-expanding information networkservice. The Cogeneration Feasibility Analysis Model (CFAM) is a computerizedsimulation model which completes a simulation of electrical, thermal,and cooling demands by a building or a complex of up to 8 buildings;it sizes cogeneration equipment and absorption chillers for four differentoperating configurations; and then the model completes a life-cycle costanalysis of the incremental capital cost of the cogeneration and associatedinterconnection equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
