The Voice of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea said theguerrillas had been besieging the area around the town of AnlungVeng since mid-November.   ``On the 19th and 20th of December, our Cambodian nationalresistance forces launched an offensive to destroy and completelyliberate the strategic Anlung Veng position,'' said a transcript ofthe radio report seen in Bangkok.   If true, the seizure of Anlung Veng would one of the mostimportant Khmer Rouge victories since their seizure of the westerntown and district capital of Pailin Oct. 22.   The Khmer Rouge also say they have taken the district seat ofSamlot.   The radio said Anlung Veng had protected the entire governmentdefense network along the Dangrek mountain range, which marks theborder between Cambodia and Thailand.   ``The attack and liberation of this position ... has basicallydismantled the networks defending the positions of the Vietnameseenemies and their puppets along the Dangrek mountain range,'' itsaid.   The guerrillas also claimed they had ``attacked and swept''other positions along route 69 and to the south and east of AnlungVeng.   The Communist Khmer Rouge is the strongest of the guerrillafactions fighting the government Vietnam installed in Phnom Penhafter its late-1978 invasion.   The invasion ended a 3{-year reign of terror by the Khmer Rougein which hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were killed.   Since Hanoi's avowed late-September troop withdrawal, theguerrillas have launched big attacks and seized several towns inthe northwestern part of the country. The Khmer Rouge maintain thatHanoi's withdrawal was a trick and that tens of thousands ofdisguised Vietnamese soliders remain in the country.   The radio report said the area around Anlung Veng was defendedby the Vietnamese 302nd division and government soldiers from the4th military region.</TEXT></DOC>
