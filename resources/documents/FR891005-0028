Similar incidents ofthe Model DC-8 main cargo door opening in flight have been reported. Thiscondition, if not corrected, could result in loss of pressurization andcontrol of the airplane. Since issuance of that AD, which was considered an interim action, theFAA further reviewed the Model DC-8 main cargo door, including the maincargo door design, prior incidents of inadvertent opening of the door inflight, maintenance of the door, operational aspects of the door, all availableservice information, and the need to provide terminating action for theinitial and repetitive inspections/checks required by that AD. Based onthis review, the FAA has determined that additional mandatory correctiveactions are necessary to ensure that the Model DC-8 main cargo door willbe properly closed, latched, and locked prior to takeoff and will not inadvertentlyopen in flight. McDonnell Douglas has developed additional safety features to prevent thedoor from opening in flight. The FAA has reviewed and approved the followingrelated McDonnell Douglas service bulletins:a. Service Bulletin 52-74, Revision 2, dated November 19, 1975, which describesinstallation of a main cargo door hydraulic isolation valve to shut offthe hydraulic pressure to the control valve when the system is not in use;b. Service Bulletin 52-76, Revision 3, dated January 29, 1986, which describesprocedures for installation of a redundant (dual) door-open indicatingsystem by installing a new door-open indicating circuit, modifying theexisting door-open indicating system, and installing a main cargo doorindicating system test circuit; c. Service Bulletin 52-75, Revision 1 dated August 9, 1974, which describesinstallation of a viewing window in the exterior skin of the door for visualinspection of the lock pin position; d. Service Bulletin 52-71, dated September 12, 1969, which describes amodification of the main cargo door latch operating mechanism to preventthe latches from closing prematurely during the door closing cycle; ande. Service Bulletin 52-80, dated March 23, 1977, which describes installationof a vent door system to improve the positive lock feature of the cargodoor latching and locking system and limit pressurization of the airplane.In addition, McDonnell Douglas is currently developing a vent door-openindicating circuit which will alert the flight crew when the vent dooris not properly closed and latched. The circuit will be part of the maincargo door-open indicating system. McDonnell Douglas plans to have thisvent door-open indicating circuit available for installation on in-serviceModel DC-8 airplanes by December 1989. McDonnell Douglas is also developing a cargo door hinge pin retainer toensure that the hinge pin will be retained in the event of a failure ofthe hinge pin. McDonnell Douglas plans to have hinge pin retainers availablefor installation on in-service Model DC-8 airplanes by December 1989. Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthis same type design, an AD is proposed which would revise AD 89-17-01to require installation of a main cargo door hydraulic isolation valve,modification to the existing door-open indicating system, installationof an additional door-open indicating circuit, installation of a main cargodoor indicating system test circuit, installation of a main cargo doorlock pin viewing window, modification of the main cargo door latch operatingmechanism and installation of a main cargo door vent system, in accordancewith the service bulletins previously described. In addition, this AD wouldrequire the installation of the aforementioned vent door-open indicatingcircuit which will signal the appropriate flight crew member when the ventdoor is not fully closed and latched; and would require the installationof a main cargo door hinge pin retainer to ensure retention of the hingepin in the event of its failure. Installation of all the above describedmodifications would constitute terminating action for the repetitive inspectionsand checks required by the existing AD. Additionally, the degree of assurance necessary as to the adequacy of inspectionsneeded to maintain the safety of the transport airplane fleet, coupledwith a better understanding of the human factors associated with numerousrepetitive inspections, has caused the FAA to place less emphasis on repetitiveinspections and more emphasis on design improvements and material replacement.Thus, in lieu of its previous position on continual inspection, the FAAhas decided to require, whenever practicable, airplane modifications necessaryto remove the source of the problem addressed. The proposed modificationrequirements of this action are in consonance with that policy decision.There are approximately 137 McDonnell Douglas Model DC-8 series airplanesof the affected design in the worldwide fleet. It is estimated that 71airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this AD, that it wouldtake approximately 180 manhours per airplane to accomplish the requiredactions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 per manhour. Therequired material cost is estimated to be $80,000 per airplane. Based onthese figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimatedto be $6,191,200. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
