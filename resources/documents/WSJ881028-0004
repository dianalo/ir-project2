Salwen </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Takeover stocks plunged yesterday, turning arbitrage heaven into arbitrage hell.    &quot;I'm not a happy dude,&quot; said one arbitrager. &quot;I think at this point most arbs are under water.&quot;    The overall stock market dropped -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 24.35 points to close at 2140.83 -- but deal stocks were hit the hardest. RJR Nabisco, considered a blue-chip takeover stock by the arbitrage community, dropped 2 3/4 to 82; the company is the target of a $90-a-share bid from leveraged buy-out specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.    Other big-name targets also plummeted. Pillsbury, which is fighting a $60-a-share offer from Grand Metropolitan PLC, declined 2 1/8 to 58 7/8. Interco, the target of a $74-a-share bid from the Rales brothers, sank 4 1/8 to 65 7/8. Kraft, which is the target of an offer by Philip Morris, dropped 3 to 94 1/2.    Fears that the takeover boom might go bust hammered the deal stocks. Traders were alarmed by news that the Federal Reserve has warned bankers about lending too much for leveraged buy-outs and other takeovers. Another shock was the withdrawal of a $1.15 billion junk-bond issue of Federated Department Stores, which had been acquired earlier this year by Campeau Corp. in a highly leveraged transaction.    As stocks plummeted yesterday, several players wondered whether the recent spate of takeovers and leveraged buy-outs had become a speculative bubble. &quot;There's a general unease on the Street about the level of takeover activity, particularly LBO activity,&quot; said Frederick W. Green, a partner at Grace andamp; Green Associates, a Mt. Kisco, N.Y., arb firm.    Crash memories also played a role yesterday, several investment professionals said. &quot;People are wondering whether maybe they're seeing the same movie they saw a year ago,&quot; said George Kellner, a principal at Kellner DiLeo andamp; Co., a big arbitrage firm here.    &quot;It's deja vu,&quot; said Mr. Green, of Grace andamp; Green. &quot;People are thinking that this is the way the market, particularly takeover stocks, were behaving before the crash.&quot;    But several arbs said they were net buyers yesterday, and expect that most of the deals will be completed. &quot;We learned last time that it was a mistake to sell takeover stocks willy-nilly,&quot; Mr. Green said. &quot;Philip Morris has the money to buy Kraft; Grand Met has the money to buy Pillsbury.&quot;    Some stocks of companies that had been rumored to be planning buy-outs, takeovers or restructurings also were hit hard and in some cases harder. Time Inc., a perennial rumor-mill favorite, plunged 5 7/8 to 111 1/2; two of Wall Street's whisper stocks, McGraw-Hill and Sears, also fell heavily.    Yesterday's plunge comes on the heels of one of the most profitable periods for arbitragers. Dozens of deals valued at tens of billions of dollars have swept through the stock market since Labor Day, and arbs have been the most prominent recipients of the good fortune.    But their confidence was shaken yesterday by the Fed and Federated news. Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, said banks have been warned to review how their LBO loans would fare in a recession or period of high inflation. And the pullback of the Federated junk bond offering indicated investors were growing wary of this form of takeover financing.    &quot;That implies there's real, real weakness in the high-yield bond market,&quot; asserted Martin Weinstein, managing director of Kubera, an arb firm. &quot;If you look at the arb stocks, you'll see there could be as much as $40 billion of junk-bond financing&quot; (for deals that are still in the works).    Yesterday's drop accelerated as institutional holders suddenly began cashing out of their takeover-related holdings. &quot;Institutions now decided that maybe they should have sold some of these stocks when they were a little higher,&quot; one arb said. As arbs discovered the institutional selling, he said, they tried to sell ahead of the large players, driving prices down even more.    Volume on some of the issues was huge. Nearly seven million RJR shares traded hands yesterday; Kraft posted volume of 5.1 million shares. Several other stocks, including TW Services, Pillsbury, Polaroid and Interco, all traded more than a million shares. Total Big Board volume was 196,540,000 shares.    The institutional moves represent a strategic shift for such big players as pension funds, insurance companies and mutual funds. Those firms traditionally would sell their takeover holdings near the first bid, taking large profits and transferring the risk of the last few points to the arbs.    But in the recent wave of takeovers, institutions have been holding their shares longer on the assumption that the first bid is rarely the final acquisition price. &quot;In the last few years (institutions) have become closet arbitragers,&quot; said Alan B. Slifka, who runs his own arbitrage firm.    Delphi Management, a large institutional holder of RJR shares, still isn't selling its holdings. &quot;It's still too cheap statistically to sell,&quot; said Scott Black, who heads the firm.    And David Dreman, who runs Dreman Value Management, says he was a buyer of Hospital Corp. of America shares yesterday as they were falling in the carnage. &quot;There was sort of an arb panic, but a lot of these deals will probably go through,&quot; he said. Hospital Corp.'s board rejected a $51-a-share buy-out bid last week; the shares closed at 45 1/4, down 1 3/8.    Meanwhile, the junk-bond market showed the same type of jitters that hurt takeover stocks. Prices of many widely traded junk bonds ended the day little changed or down slightly despite a broad rally in Treasury issues that pushed government bond prices higher.    KKR sought to bolster the credibility of its $20.6 billion offer for RJR Nabisco. The leveraged buy-out firm said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it is &quot;extremely confident&quot; it can promptly arrange financing to complete the offer.    While blue-chip issues were generally caught in the market's downdraft, General Motors was a prominent exception. Its third-quarter net income rose to $2.46 a share from $2.28 a year earlier, rather than falling sharply as analysts had generally expected.    In the ranks of companies involved in offers or rumors of takeovers or buy-outs, West Point-Pepperell dropped 3 3/8 to 44 1/2, Polaroid declined 1 3/8 to 35 1/2, Pennwalt plunged 3 3/8 to 83, TW Services closed at 25, unchanged, F.W. Woolworth lost 1 7/8 to 54, Kimberly-Clark dropped 2 5/8 to 60, Mead fell 2 to 44 3/4, and U.S. Shoe eased 1 3/8 to 24 1/4.    Food stocks were weak for the third session in a row as hopes for a continuation of takeover activity in that sector faded further. Ralston Purina fell 2 3/4 to 82 3/8, Gerber Products dropped 1 to 56 1/2, CPC International fell 1 1/2 to 54, Sara Lee slid 5/8 to 46 3/8, and Quaker Oats was down 1 1/4 to 56.    Raychem, which surprised analysts by reporting lower earnings for its first quarter, ended Sept. 30, plummeted 3 1/4 to 36. The company's net fell to 17 cents a share from 49 cents a year earlier.    Semiconductor stocks showed weakness in the wake of Intel's meeting with analysts Wednesday, which was poorly received. Motorola fell 1 1/8 to 38 3/8, Texas Instruments slipped 1 1/4 to 37 3/8 and Advanced Micro Devices eased 3/8 to 8 5/8. Intel lost 1 to 25 in over-the-counter trading.    Fuqua Industries rose 1/2 to 32 3/4 on news that Chairman J.B. Fuqua and members of his family granted Triton Group an option to buy more than 1.3 million common shares from them next January for $36 each. Golden Nugget, which said it plans to buy as many as five million of its common shares, rose 3/4 to 13 3/4.    British issues traded in New York bucked the downturn, gaining strength from the London stock market's performance. Plessey gained 1 1/4 to 30, British Telecom rose 3/8 to 43 3/8, British Gas gained 3/8 to 29 3/8 and BET went up 5/8 to 16 3/4.    The American Stock Exchange index dropped 2.80 to 300.64. Volume was 8,220,000 shares, compared with nine million Wednesday. There were 174 issues advancing, 409 declining and 265 unchanged.    Larizza Industries skidded 1 7/8 to 13 7/8. It fell 5/8 the previous day when Shearson Lehman Hutton cut its investment rating on the stock, according to the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Shearson predicted that the stock will lag the short-term market by as much as 20%.    ---   David Wilson contributed to this article.    ---                        Toppling Targets                            YESTER-        CHG.
