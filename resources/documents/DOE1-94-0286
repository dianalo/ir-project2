The completion of a 40 kW fuelcell field test at the Industry Hills Exhibit-Conference Center has proventhrough operation on landfill gas that the fuel cell technology can utilizewaste derived fuels. The use of by-product gaseous fuels for power generationoffers a utility and its customers many benefits including the displacementof scarce fuel oil and natural gas resources, and a decrease in the adversesocial impact of by-product waste disposal. This paper presents the resultsof a study by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC),looking at the technical and economic market potential for 11 MW fuelcell power plants within Edison's territory.</TEXT></DOC>
