Rescuers used chain saws to keep two small breathing holes openin the six-inch thick Arctic Ocean ice, but freezing temperaturesthreatened to close them. The whales became trapped nearly twoweeks ago while migrating south to warmer waters.   The endangered California gray whales, about 24 to 30 feet long,were bleeding and battered from continually bashing into the jaggedice and were exhausted from swimming against the ocean current toremain in place.   ``They don't look as spry. Their movements are diminished,'' RonMorris of the National Marine Fisheries Service said Monday.   ``Their condition has worsened since they were first spotted.One has a little pneumonia but the others are all right. Butthere's no question in my mind that they'll be here when thevehicle arrives,'' said Morris.   The whales were trapped about 18 miles northeast of this InupiatEskimo village. They were only a few hundred feet offshore in 45feet of water, with their largest breathing hole about 10 feet by20 feet.   The whales ordinarily can stay underwater nearly four minutes,said Geoff Carroll, a wildlife biologist with the North SlopeBorough. Carroll said they have been surfacing about every twominutes, indicating they were becoming tired and stressed.   Rescuers were racing against onshore winds that threatened toclose leads in the ice that would serve as the whales' escape routeif the ice-breaking barge is able to free them.   Environmentalists, federal authorities and the oil industry havejoined in an unlikely alliance to rush a barge to the whales sothat it can smash a path to open water some seven miles away.   A spindly Army National Guard CH-54 Skycrane planned to lift offfrom Prudhoe Bay to tow the 185-ton barge 200 miles northwest tothe beleaguered whales. The trip was expected to take from 25 to 40hours.   Crews labored around-the-clock during the weekend to get thebarge and the Skycrane ready to go. The vessel, a Hovercraft-typebarge, belongs to Veco Inc., an oil field service company.   Crews were being especially cautious as they prepared the rigMonday.   ``We're checking under the rig, checking the airbags andchecking anything that can go wrong,'' said Pete Leathard, a Vecospokesman. ``We're not going to move that thing until we can makesure we'll have a clean run to Barrow. The Arctic is not a goodplace to break down in winter.''   Plans called for the helicopter to pull the 85-by-60-foot bargewith an 800-foot cable, said Mike Haller, spokesman for the AlaskaNational Guard.   ``The plan has great potential for danger because of the atitudeof the helicopter in the towing position. The nose is down,'' hesaid. ``The danger is that if a line snaps and comes back up andgets in the rotors, we've got real trouble.''   The helicopter, which costs $1,500 to $3,000 an hour to operate,will trade off with a second Skycrane which has been flown toPrudhoe Bay. The barge carried 20,000 gallons of fuel for thehelicopters and the barge, Haller said. The fuel was provided byArco Alaska Inc.   Oil company officials have estimated the rescue effort couldcost as much as $500,000.   Greenpeace representative Cindy Lowry arrived in Barrow onSunday with recordings of migrating whales which she wants to playalong the ice floe to lure the whales to safety.   The population of endangered California gray whales numbersabout 20,000 and has been growing at an annual average of 2.5percent for the past decade, authorities said.   The whales spend their winters in the warm waters off Mexico andSouthern California.</TEXT></DOC>
