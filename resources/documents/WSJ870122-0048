Separately, the Commerce Department said housing starts surged 13.7% in December to an annual rate of 1,802,000 units after falling 2.6% in November to a revised 1,585,000 pace. Previously the department said starts fell 1.8% in November to a 1,598,000-unit pace. For the year, starts rose 3.7% to 1,806,600, the most for any year since 2,020,300 in 1978.    The inflation report underscored the striking impact of the energy-price decline. The overall annual increase in the department's consumer price index, including energy prices, was the smallest since 0.7% in 1961. Excluding energy, however, prices were up 3.8%, a sharply higher but still moderate rise in keeping with the underlying inflation rate of the past few years. In 1985, consumer prices rose 3.8%.    Last year energy prices plunged 19.7%, the sharpest drop since the department began tracking the category in 1957. Gasoline prices dropped a record 30.7%; the government started keeping those figures in 1937.    With the oil-price plunge unlikely to be repeated this year, economists generally expect inflation to accelerate, partly as a result of the dollar's decline in foreign currency trading. A lower dollar boosts import prices, eventually allowing domestic producers to raise prices, too. But most analysts expect inflation to remain in a moderate zone of 3.5% to 4%.    &quot;Prices will be up more rapidly in 1987 than in 1986,&quot; said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. &quot;But there's nothing fundamentally wrong with what's going to happen to the inflation picture.&quot;    Joel Popkin, a consultant based here, said he expects the index to move up about 3.5% in 1987. Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, predicted a 3.8% rise.    The December increase in the consumer price index, which amounted to a 2.9% compound annual rate, followed a November increase of 0.3%, or a 3.3% pace. Energy prices rose 0.3% last month after a 0.7% drop the month before. Food prices were up 0.2% after a 0.5% rise.    Excluding those items, which tend to move erratically from month to month, prices rose 0.3% for the second consecutive month.    The consumer price report follows a report that producer prices for finished goods dropped 2.5% last year, the biggest decline since 1949.    On housing, many economists attributed the strong showing for December partly to declines in mortgage rates in recent months. Mr. Gramley said, &quot;We ought to conclude that the single-family market is alive and healthy. We had some boost to starts in December as a consequence of the decline in mortgage rates since September.&quot;    He predicted that single-family starts &quot;would do quite well in 1987.&quot; Last month they rose 11.2% to a 1,209,000 rate after increasing 0.2% in November to a 1,087,000 pace.    Many economists however, expect weakness in multifamily residences as a result of high vacancy rates and overbuilding in many areas, plus the new tax law's elimination of many tax-shelter incentives. Last month multifamily starts rose 19% to a 593,000-unit rate after falling 8.3% to a 498,000-unit pace.    Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted that construction of single-family homes &quot;should fare well in 1987.&quot; But, pointing to the tax-law changes and the high vacancy rates, he said that total starts in 1987 may be less than last year.    Moreover, several economists, noting the difficulty of adjusting for seasonal factors in the winter months, suggested that the housing strength may have been overstated as a result of unusually mild weather in the Midwest and Northeast. The monthly figures in both reports are seasonally adjusted.    By region, starts leaped 50% in the Midwest and were up 17.6% in the Northeast, 3.7% in the South and 5.2% in the West.    Building permits were issued last month at a 1,893,000-unit annual pace, up 17.4% from a 1,613,000-unit pace in November. The sharpest rise in permits was in the West, where they rose almost 54%. However, the department said that a large number of permits were issued in California, where builders sought to avoid a fee increase that took effect Jan. 1.    In a third report, the Labor Department said that the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers fell 0.9% in December, after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors, following a 0.6% rise the month before. The drop reflected a 0.1% decline in average hourly earnings and a 0.6% decline in hours worked.    Weekly earnings of U.S. workers averaged $305.86 in December, after adjustment for seasonal factors but not for inflation, down from $307.98 in November.    The prices report showed that before adjustment, the consumer price index for all urban consumers rose 0.1% in December to 331.1% of its 1967 average and stood 1.1% above a year earlier.    The index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, a measure that includes half the number of people covered by the all-urban index and is used in adjusting Social Security and other retirement benefits, increased 0.1% last month to 325.7% of its 1967 average, and was up 0.7% from a year earlier.    Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for December.                                            % change from                                         Nov.
