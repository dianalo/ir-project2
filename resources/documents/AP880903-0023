Hundreds of people sought refuge from flooding along the coastbefore Hurricane Debby moved inland Friday and was downgraded to atropical storm. There were no reports of injuries.   ``The worst is over,'' said Navy Capt. Domingo Rojas Cadenasearly today. But he said Debby still carried wind gusts of up to 56mph.   The storm center stalled on reaching the eastern Sierra Madremountain range 50 miles from the gulf coast, said the NationalWeather Service in Mexico City. Heavy rains continued to fall inparts of Veracruz and Tamaulipas states.   ``We can say the storm is becoming disorganized,'' a weatherservice spokesman said. He said winds would diminish to 30 mphtoday and that ``the storm should disappear by Saturday night.''   The service said Debby moved inland Friday afternoon at Tuxpan,a city of 120,000 about 165 miles northeast of Mexico City. It saidat that time the storm was carrying winds up to 74 mph, the minimumstrength to be classified as a hurricane.   The storm caused power outages in Tuxpan and Poza Rica, about 20miles to the south, and dozens of people were evacuated fromlow-lying areas in the two cities and near the Tuxpan and Tecolutlarivers.   Heavy rains and winds downed trees, left cars stranded onflooded streets and blew roofs off homes in Tuxpan, Rojas said.   ``Many streets are inundated, and the rivers are rising fast,''said Red Cross worker Francisco Javier Cruz Balderas.   Hundreds of people sought refuge in public shelters in Alamo, acoffee-producing town about 20 miles west of Tuxpan, said RobertoMartinez, editor of the newspaper El Mundo of Tampico.   Dozens of residents had to be rescued from cars and floodedhomes in Poza Rica, a city of 300,000. Authorities closed streetsin some sections of the city because of flooding.   ``(There's) a lot of trash in the streets and tree trunks areblocking runoff,'' said Red Cross spokesman Alan Garcia in PozaRica. ``Even we can't get out _ we're trapped.''   Martinez said there were power outages throughout the northernVeracruz coastline and that some local roads were cut off byflooding.   Guadalupe Lopez, a spokeswoman with the Veracruz stategovernment in Jalapa, said there were no reports of deaths orinjuries. She said officials had no estimate of damages.   Debby grew from a depression into a tropical storm early Fridayand then gathered strength, becoming a hurricane by afternoon whenit was just off the coast.   It was the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane seasonand the fourth named storm.</TEXT></DOC>
