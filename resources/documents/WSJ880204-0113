In written responses to questions posed by three regional Bell companies, ATandamp;T said that around July 28, 1987, GSA engineer S.L. Soni told an ATandamp;T saleswoman that the price ATandamp;T had submitted for a Washington, D.C., telephone-switch contract &quot;was not good enough to win.&quot;    On Aug. 19, ATandamp;T has said, it lowered its bid for the contract to $30 a month from $40 per connection to the switch. That was the only instance, ATandamp;T said, in which it lowered its price after its initial bid April 1.    The ATandamp;T admission marks a startling twist in the investigation into the GSA's awarding of a $55 million contract for a dozen phone switches. Until now, ATandamp;T, which is protesting the contract award, has been portrayed by investigators as the aggrieved party. The GSA's inspector general is looking into whether Mr. Soni, a senior design engineer, leaked ATandamp;T information to BellSouth Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp.    ATandamp;T said it didn't rely on Mr. Soni's information to lower its bid. Rather, it said, it had already planned to reduce its bid before talking to him. ATandamp;T eventually lost the Washington contract to Bell Atlantic, which said it bid $18.40.    But investigators said the Soni conversation was significant anyway because it signaled that ATandamp;T may have had advance warning that he was involved in wrongdoing and didn't disclose that early knowledge until last week, when it filed its written answers.    According to ATandamp;T, on July 28, ATandamp;T saleswoman Mary Jane Golden met with Mr. Soni, who told her that ATandamp;T's bid was too high and pressed her to disclose what ATandamp;T's final bid would be. ATandamp;T said Ms. Golden refused to answer Mr. Soni, telling him that he was putting her &quot;in an awkward position.&quot;    However, ATandamp;T said that neither Ms. Golden nor her supervisor, Carly Fiorina, complained about Mr. Soni's questioning to his supervisors or to the GSA's inspector general. On Tuesday, Ms. Fiorina said that on July 1, 1987, before the Soni conversation, she told GSA managers about her suspicions that GSA was leaking information and that one GSA employee was so offended by the suggestion that he walked out of the meeting. An ATandamp;T spokesman said Ms. Fiorina was loath to complain again. &quot;She was still trying to court the customer,&quot; an ATandamp;T spokesman said.    ATandamp;T finds itself in the same position as Bell Atlantic, which has said it received confidential information from Mr. Soni, but denied it had any value in the bidding contest.    The newest allegations against Mr. Soni also raise questions of whether he was favoring one company over another, or rather trying to spur competition by allegedly leaking information in the hopes of getting the lowest price possible. Mr. Soni won't answer questions about his role. </TEXT></DOC>
