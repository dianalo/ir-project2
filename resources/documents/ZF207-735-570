 The Repository is anintegral component of IBM's applications-development framework for the 1990s,called Application Development (AD)/Cycle.andM;This framework will provide a standard applications-development environmentthat complies with IBM's Systems Application Architecture (SAA).andP;  TheRepository incorporated within AD/Cycle will eventually have a major effecton computer-aided software engineering (CASE) vendors, software vendors andinformation-systems organizations.andP;  It will also have a critical impact onapplications development in the 1990s.andP;  Unfortunately, the IBM Repository isfar from complete.andM;AD/Cycle supports a common set of user-interaction services, programminglanguages, database services and communication services defined by SAA.andP;  Boththe AD/Cycle tools and the applications developed with the tools will conformto SAA.andP;  Within SAA, applications development is supported through directinteraction with the services provided by the Common Programming Interface(CPI) or through the higher-level AD/Cycle development environment.andM;As shown in the figure, the AD/Cycle environment consists of the followingcomponents:andM;-- A user interface that complies with the standards defined by the CommonUser Access (CUA) component of SAA.andP;  All software products that conform toCUA standards will have a common &quot;look and feel.&quot;andM;-- Applications-development tools, such as CASE products, that are typicallysupplied by third-party vendors.andP;  AD/Cycle provides an open framework thatenables tools from multiple vendors to be used within a commonapplications-development environment.andM;-- A common repository used to store design specifications in a standardformat.andP;  Tools that obey this standard format can share design information.andM;-- An applications generator that extracts design specifications from theRepository and automatically generates application code.andP;  IBM's applicationsgenerator for SAA is the Cross System Product (CSP), which is integrated withAD/Cycle.andM;-- CPI services defined by SAA.andP;  These include presentation and dialogueservices, programming-language services, database-access services via acommon SQL interface, communications services and other types of supportservices.andM;Users are demanding products that support an open software environment.andO;Corporations want the ability to mix and match compatible software productsfrom different vendors.andP;  For example, some users might want to select avariety of front-end CASE tools, code generators, documentation generatorsand project-management facilities, all of which are fully integrated with acommon repository of design information.andP;  The user might want to operatewithin a software environment in which compatible tools from differentvendors can be plugged into a standard applications-development environment.andM;AD/Cycle is designed to support an open software-development environment inwhich the best ideas and products from multiple vendors can be incorporatedwithin a common framework.andP;  However, surveys of installations that arecurrently achieving very high speeds of applications development indicatethat the best results are obtained from highly integrated families ofproducts that include front-end CASE workstations, an integral code generatorand a methodology optimized for high-speed development.andP;  A high degree ofintegration among products may be more important than the ability to selectmultiple non-integrated products within an open software environment.andM;IBM has acknowledged that there are many new, powerful tools for applicationsdevelopment, and that the 1990s is going to be a decade of great creativity.andO;Some of these tools will be CASE products, some will relate to artificialintelligence, and some will represent an evolution of fourth-generationlanguage tools.andM;IBM is encouraging independent vendors to develop tools that can help drivethe rest of IBM's hardware and software environment.andP;  It is making a strongpush to encourage those vendors to build tools according to IBM's standards-- standards such as SAA, Token-Ring, as well as future connections to100M-bit local area networks.andM;In the push to develop applications, a repository of design information ispivotally important.andP;  Such a repository is used to store information aboutthe enterprise, data models, process models, reusable code and reusabledesigns.andM;The CASE repository is an integral part of the CASE environment.andP;  It is usedto store design specifications, which are then used to drive thecode-generation process.andM;Reuse of data models and process models from different tools will work onlyif the design information in the repository conforms to an industry standard.andM;A similar situation arises in communications networking, in which allcommunicating devices must obey a common set of connection standards.andP;  In theworld of networking, there are formal standards set by organizations such asthe International Standards Organization, as well as de facto proprietarystandards such as IBM's Systems Network Architecture and Digital EquipmentCorp.'s DECnet.andM;In the world of the repository, standards committees have not yet created orseriously addressed the types of facilities that are implemented in theencyclopedias of high-end CASE tools.andP;  The ANSI Information ResourceDictionary System standard covers only a fraction of the information that isspecified by existing high-end CASE tools.andM;The CASE repository is really the heart of CASE.andM;It is IBM's view that if the AD/Cycle Repository can be created and made a defacto standard, then many different vendors can offer ingenious products thatuse the common repository.andM;Agreeing on the DesignandM;An important problem arises, however, because there are currently more than200 CASE vendors, each with a different way of representing the diagrams usedin the modeling and design of systems.andP;  Is it feasible for all vendors toagree on one meta-data model for design information?andM;IBM is encouraging vendors to agree on a common meta-data model for theinformation stored in the Repository.andM;A common model would allow design specifications to be shared among multipleproducts.andM;IBM has announced its version of the meta-data model in the form of thecommon repository.andP;  To comply with this model, vendors must modify theirrepositories to use the definitions embodied in the IBM Repository.andM;Currently, CASE vendors are creating entity-relationship diagrams and otherdiagram types that are incompatible.andP;  If this trend continues, it may causemajor damage to the computer industry.andM;The burden is on vendors to recognize the strategic importance of complyingwith a repository standard, even if it means changing the way they representinformation.andM;By conforming to a common design repository, vendors will have access tobetter technology such as object-oriented and relational techniques, as wellas the ability to share design information with a growing number of compliantproducts.andM;Next week, I will discuss vendor compliance with the Repository standardsdefined by AD/Cycle.andM;----------To learn more about the subject of these articles, please call The JamesMartin Report, an information service updated quarterly, at (800) 242-1240.andO;For information on seminars, please contact (in the United States and Canada)Technology Transfer Institute, 741 10th St., Santa Monica, Calif.andP;
