The base is operated by guerrillas of the Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine, one of nine factions of the PalestineLiberation Organization.   A statement by the Israeli military command indicated, however,that it was not the intended target and that the air force meant tobomb another PLO base.   Meanwhile, Syrian and Christian gunners traded rocket andartillery fire in and around Beirut amid reports that Christian armycommander Gen. Michel Aoun had rejected a Syrian proposal forhalting the confrontation.   Police said three people were killed, including a sergeantserving with Aoun's troops.   The casualties raised the overall toll to 370 people killed and1,441 wounded since the fighting broke out on March 8.   The guerrilla base bombed by the Israelis is located in pinewoods just outside Bshamoun, a tiny Druse village about eight milessoutheast of Beirut. Many of the trees caught fire after the planes,diving from clear skies, dropped at least 10 bombs on theguerrillas' position.   Palls of smoke could be seen rising from the area as guerrillasfired their AK-47 rifles into the air to warn away reporters andphotographers.   ``They've raided our base,'' shouted one angry fighter, wearing ared headband. ``I'll shoot whoever approaches the area.''   Four ambulances sped into the base, each carried one woundedguerrilla to Kamal Jumblatt Hospital in Choueifat, a nearby Drusetown, the rescuers said.   Police said two planes first dropped four rockets on the base at11:50 a.m. Four more jets swept low over the base 20 minutes laterand dropped six more bombs.   A guerrilla, who identified himself only as Ayman, said: ``Wedidn't even hear the jets roaring overhead. We realized we wereunder attack when the first two planes fired four rockets.''   A police spokesman said the jets dropped 250-pound bombs.   The statement by the Israeli military command said the planesraided a base of the Syrian-based Palestine Liberation Front, a tinyPLO faction founded by the late Talaat Yacoub, who had split fromthe Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the mid-1970s.   The Israeli army said the air raid was in retaliation for a May28 barrage of Soviet-made Katyusha rockets that hit the northerntown of Metullah, injuring an 8-month-old baby. The attack wasaccompanied by an unsuccessful infiltration attempt.   Both the PLO factions claimed responsibility.   The Popular Front, led by George Habash, is a Marxist group basedin Damascus, Syria, and the second-largest of the PLO factions.   Loud explosions echoed across Beirut during the bombing attack,the seventh by Israel jets into Lebanon this year.   The police spokesman said the planes released scarlet balloons todeflect heat-seeking missiles. But guerrilla defenders did notdeploy such weapons, he said, speaking on anonymity in line withstanding regulations.   Guerrillas opened up with twin-barelled 23mm anti-aircraft gunsbut scored no hits, he said.   By police count, six people were killed and 49 wounded in the sixprevious Israeli air attacks.   A lone Israeli helicopter gunship rocketed Iranian-backedguerrillas in southern Lebanon last Wednesday wounding three membersof the Shiite Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of God.   Lakhdar Ibrahimi of Algeria, assistant secretary-general of theArab League, was in Moslem west Beirut today to meet with actingPrime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads one of twocabinets competing to run the country.   The other government is run by Gen. Aoun, a Maronite Catholic.   The prestigious daily newspaper An-Nahar said the latest round offighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war intensified after Aounrejected a Syrian proposal for the formation of a ``securitycommittee'' representing various Lebanese factions to overseeimplementation of a cease-fire.   An-Nahar said Aoun insisted on the creation of a``Lebanese-Syrian security committee,'' arguing that theconfrontation was between Syrian and Lebanese forces and not amongLebanese factions.</TEXT></DOC>
