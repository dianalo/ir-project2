Meridian Oil Gathering Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP89-2035-000]</ITAG>Take notice that on August 30, 1989, Meridian Oil Gathering Inc. (Meridian),2919 Allen Parkway, Houston, Texas 77210, filed in Docket No. CP89-2035-000a petition under Rule 207 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure(18 CFR 385.207) for a declaratory order that its existing gathering facilitiesand the proposed expansion thereto are exempt from the Commission's jurisdictionpursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA). Meridian statesthat it is an indirect subsidiary of Meridian Oil Holding Inc., a majoroil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, production, andsale of oil and natural gas. Meridian states that it is also an affiliateof El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), a regulated interstate pipeline,and of Meridian Oil Hydrocarbons Inc., an intrastate pipeline.Meridian states that it performs a gathering and treating service for coalseam gas produced in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico. Meridian statesthat approximately 350-400 coal seam gas wells were drilled in the SanJuan Basin in 1988, and an equal or greater number are protected for 1989.As such, Meridian states that it will expand its existing gathering systemto accommodate this increased need. However, Meridian seeks confirmationfrom the Commission in this proceeding that its facilities are exempt fromNGA jurisdiction.According to Meridian, the gas it presently gathers in the San Juan Basinis moved to the Val Verde treating plant for eventual delivery to El Pasofor transportation to market. Meridian adds that it acts only as a gathererand treater; it neither buys nor sells gas. The gas Meridian presentlygathers and treats is from wells that are owned or operated by affiliatesof Meridian and other producers.The expanded system will, according to Meridian, gather coal seam gas,the majority of which has a high carbon dioxide content which exceeds thequality standards of El Paso and other potentially available gatherersand pipelines. Meridian states that this content ranges from about 4-13.5percent and currently averages about 10.5-11.5 percent at the Val VerdePlant. Meridian states that El Paso's quality standards allow for no morethan about 1-2 percent carbon dioxide. Thus, Meridian states that thisgas must be treated before it can be introduced into a pipeline for transportationto market. Meridian states that its existing gathering facilities consist of one maingathering line (Line MA) and related lateral facilities and well tie-ins.A portion of Line MA was, according to Meridian, owned and operated byEl Paso as a non-jurisdictional, uncertificated gathering facility. Meridianstates that Line MA and the appurtenant facilities were sold to it by ElPaso effective September 1988. Meridian states that Line MA collects coal seam gas from forty-seven wellconnections,\1\<NOTE/> moves about 130 MMcf per day (MMcfd) to the Val Verde Plantfor treating, and then delivers approximately 110 MMcfd to El Paso fortransportation. Meridian charges all shippers a negotiated rate for itsgathering, compressing, or treating service, depending on the level ofservices required by a shipper and pursuant to agreements negotiated witheach shipper. At the present time, Meridian indicated that all shipperrequests for gathering service that are covered by an executed agreementare being accommodated, since the capacity of Line MA exceed the existingdemand. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ It is stated that 12 coal seam wells are connected directlyto Line MA, while the remaining wells are joined by 20 miles of 4-12 inchdiameter laterals that intersect with Line MA. Line MA consists of approximately31 miles of 16 inch diameter pipe, with two compressor sites. Meridianalso states that there are approximately 10 miles of well tie-ins 4-8 inchesin diameter. It is indicated that the laterals and the well tie-ins areowned and operated by Meridian as part of the Line MA gathering system.The Line MA facilities are, according to Meridian, located behind the ValVerde treating plant, which is connected to El Paso's pipeline system.Meridian states that the Val Verde plant is owned and operated by a companynot affiliated with Meridian; however, Meridian leases the plant with anoption to purchase. Thus, Meridian states it may become the plant ownerin the near future. The Val Verde Plant now has a design capacity of approximately175 MMcfd, but it is stated that the plant capability can be expanded toaccommodate additional volumes, if the commitment from shippers warrant.Meridian plans to expand its existing gathering facilities in order toaccommodate the increasing production and deliverability of coal seam gasin the surrounding area. Due to its high carbon dioxide content, it isstated that such gas cannot be introduced into other existing gatheringsystems located in this part of the San Juan Basin unless it has been treatedor other arrangements have been made. Consequently, Meridian avers thatits separate expanded gathering and treating system is necessary to movethese significant new quantities of additional gas to market. The expanded Meridian facilities will consist, it is stated, of severallarger connecting lines similar to Line MA, and numerous laterals and welltie-ins. At the present time, Meridian plans to develop three additionallines, Lines MB, MC, and MD, under the following specifications: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s200,9,6-2,6/3,6-3 </C>  <H1>Line </H1><H1>Length (miles) </H1><H1>Diameter (inches) </H1><H1>Pressure (psig) </H1><H1>Capacity (MMcf) </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">MB <D>27 </D><D>20 </D><D>\2\ 350/900 </D><D>325 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">MC <D>9 </D><D>20 </D><D>350 </D><D>90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">MD <D>20 </D><D>10-16 </D><D>\2\ 350/900 </D><D>45-185 </D><F>\2\ The lower pressure is upstream of proposed compressors and the higherpressure is downstream of those compressors.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="10">It is estimated that there will be approximately 120 aggregate milesof laterals interconnected with the Lines MB-MD, plus approximately 160collective miles of well connections leading to in excess of 500 coal seamgas wells. Meridian states that it will make its expanded system available to allinterested shippers on a first come, first served basis. Further, no preferencewill be given to any shipper, affiliated or unaffiliated, with respecteither to access to the system or to the rate charged for Meridian's services.It is stated that the rate charged will be negotiated with individual shippers,considering that coal seam gas producers have other options to get theirgas to market. For example, producers could deliver their gas to anothersystem by either removing the carbon dioxide at the wellhead or by constructingtheir own treating plant and delivery system. Once completed, Meridian states that the expanded system will connect toover 500 coal seam gas wells and make possible the delivery to the nation'sgas markets of up to 500-600 MMcfd of new gas supply over the course ofthe next twenty years. Meridian states that a declaratory order confirmingthe exempt status of its expanded system under the NGA will facilitateand expedite completion of this system. Meridian further states that itsexpanded system will only perform a gathering function, as illustratedby its network-like geographic configuration, the situs of wells all alongthe component gathering lines, and the location of the entire system behinda treating plant. Meridian further avers that the physical dimensions,operating pressure, and design capacity of the expanded system are consistentwith the performance of a gathering function. Therefore, Meridian assertsthat no regulatory purpose would be served by the Commission's assertingjurisdiction. <T3>Comment date:</T3> October 10, 1989, in accordance with the first subpargraphof Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">2.
