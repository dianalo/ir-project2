(Telephone: 202/789-6820.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On March 1, 1989, the Commission issuedproposals to amend rule 31(k)(2) of our rules of practice (39 CFR 3001.31(k)(2)),which governs the statistical presentations of all parties to our proceedings;rule 54(j) of our rules of practice (39 CFR 3001.54(j)), which governsthe Postal Service's presentation of projected volumes in our proceedings;and rule 102(b) of our rules of practice (39 CFR 3001.102(b)), which governsperiodic data reporting requirements to the Commission. (See 54 FR 9848-52,March 8, 1989.) Our proposals were meant to establish initial documentationstandards for these categories of evidence that would be clearer and morespecific than those contained in our current rules. Their purpose was toexpedite discovery and cross-examination of such evidence and to facilitateits analysis in the limited time available in our rate hearings. Most ofthe comments applauded our proposals generally, agreeing that there isa need to expedite discovery and cross-examination of such evidence throughimproved documentation requirements. Many of them asked that we make asimilar effort to improve documentation standards for other categoriesof evidence where they see a similar need to expedite the discovery andcross-examination.We received comments on our proposals from the Postal Service, the AmericanNewspaper Publishers Association (ANPA), the Bureau of Economics of theFederal Trade Commission (Bureau), the Direct Marketing Association (DMA),the Office of the Consumer Advocate (OCA), Time, Inc. (Time), and UnitedParcel Service (UPS). These comments were extensive, and suggested a significantnumber of modifications to our proposals, including some directly relevantnew proposals. Therefore, in this Second Notice, we are revising our proposedrules and providing a second opportunity for comment, both on them, andon new proposals that are directly relevant.As we have noted, several parties suggested changes to our rules that werenot directly related to the proposals in our Notice of March 1, 1989. TheOCA proposed extensive revisions to our rules governing documentation ofsample surveys (rule 31(k)(2)(i)), and our rules governing ongoing reportingby the Postal Service of costing data (rule 102(a)). It also proposed lessextensive revisions to our rules governing documentation of ``other statisticalstudies'' (rule 31(k)(2)(iv)); computer-based evidence (rule 31(k)(3));costing data (rule 54(h)); and the requirement that an independent auditaccompany each formal rate request (rule 54(q)).Time made the general proposal that we amend rule 31(k) to provide thatwhatever data and documentation rule 31(k) requires for statistical studies,econometric studies, and computer analyses be produced automatically atthe time that the study is filed. It also made the general proposal thatrule 102(a) be amended to require the Postal Service to file annually thedata and reports produced by its city carrier street cost data collectionsystems. Time Comments at 3.DMA proposed that we amend rule 54(j) to require the Postal Service toprovide volume data and forecasts broken down by rate category to facilitatethe analysis of revenues and costs. DMA Comments at 2.We are not inviting comment on these indirectly related proposals for tworeasons. One is that they are so basic and wide ranging that their inclusionin this docket would make it unmanageable.Another reason is that the large majority of them appear to represent onlythe formative stage of serious proposals. Most seem to fall into two categories.One category consists of exceedingly general proposals unaccompanied byspecific proposed language, or substantial supporting rationale. The othercategory consists of very elaborate proposals framed in exceedingly detailedproposed language that do not appear to be tied to a well defined need,or to reflect a thorough consideration of their interrelationships, ortheir impact upon hearing participants. In short, these indirectly relevantproposals need to be ``fleshed out'' or ``boiled down,'' depending uponwhich category they belong to, before it would be productive to launcha docket to evaluate them.Some of our initial proposals drew favorable responses from all of thecommenters. Our initial proposal that econometric studies be accompaniedat the outset by descriptions and source citations for input data (proposedrule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>f</T3>)), and by a set of standard measures of statistical reliability(proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>g</T3>)), were generally concured in. Our initial proposals that thePostal Service provide with its filing a ``turn-key'' computer implementationof its forecasting procedure (proposed rules 54(j)(6)(iii)-(v)), and machine-readableinput files and progams sufficient to replicate the Postal Services demandstudy (proposed rules 54(j)(7) (i) and (v)) were generally concurred inby the commenters. The Postal Service's assurance that it will providethis material has persuaded us to delete some of our documentation proposals,and observe over the next rate cycle whether a turn-key computer implementationis sufficient to achieve the objectives of those deleted proposals.In its comments, the Postal Service said that it perceived a theme runningthroughout our original proposal that demand analysis and volume forecastingshould be devoid of judgment. Postal Service Initial Comments, at 4. Thatis a misimpression. We are aware that judgment plays a legitimate rolein the development of econometric demand models. We recognize that, amongother things, it is indispensable to the process of sifting through reasonablecandidates for the functional form and variables of the demand equation.We also agree that judgment is necessary to determine whether, and in whatmanner, an econometric demand model should be modified, for example, withunmodellable ``add factors,'' in order to improve the accuracy of a forecast.Substantively, we have expressed as our goal that the Postal Service'sforecasts be based on the best econometric practice. This is not a questionof whether judgment is used, or not used, but how it is used. We have expressedsome criticism in the past of the subtantive manner in which the PostalService has employed judgment in its econometric analysis. <T3>See </T3>PRC Op. R87-1, paras. 2175-80 and Appendix H at 13. Our concernwith these proposals, however, is procedural, not substantive. The intendedtheme was not that judgment in these areas should be suppressed, but thatits role be made explicit and trackable, to the maximum extent possible.It is precisely because the role of judgment is so crucial in econometricanalysis and in volume forecasting, that our rules should place a premiumon documenting and articulating it. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule 54(j)(6). </ITAG>Of our initial proposals, perhaps the one that was most responsible forthe Postal Service's impression that we were seeking to suppress the useof judgment in demand anlysis and forecasting was our proposed rewordingof the preamble to current rule 54(j)(6). We had proposed to add to thatpreamble a requirement that the Postal Service's volume forecast ``conformexactly to the assumptions and specifications used in the econometric demandstudy.'' In our Notice of March 1, 1989, at 11, we explained that our intent wasto prevent ``unacknowledged differences between the Postal Service's demandmodel as presented, and its model as implemented in making the forecastsrequired by the current rule.'' The Postal Service has pointed out to usthat this language is susceptible to being misconstrued to mean that itsvolume forecast must be a mechanistic extrapolation of its econometricmodel of historic demand, with judgmental modifications or unmodelled ``addfactors'' prohibited. As stated in our initial Notice, our intent was only to require that anymodifications made to the forecasts that are derived from the econometricdemand model be acknowledged and explained. It was not to prohibit or discouragejudgmental adjustments to such forecasts. The Postal Service expressedsome concern in its comments that our proposal would bar the use of itsnet trend ``add factor'' to judgmentally adjust its forecasts. Postal ServiceComments at 23. It had some justification for this concern, based uponremarks made by Commission staff in an informal public conference on ourproposals. It is not our intent, however, to restrict judgmental adjustmentsto forecasts, such as net trend. To avoid misconstruction of our intent, we have revised the language thatwe originally proposed for the preamble to rule 54(j)(6) to convey ourintent that the Postal Service acknowledge and explain any departures fromthe assumptions and specifications of its econometric demand model thatit makes in its forecasting procedure. Illustrations of departures to whichthe proposed language would apply can be found in section ``G. Discrepancies''of Appendix H, in PRC Op. R87-1, Volume 2. The purpose of this proposed change is to make it easier to track and evaluatethe Postal Service's forecasting method. The OCA suggested language forproposed rules 54(j)(5) (ii) and (iii) that would require the Postal Serviceto demonstrate a step-by-step derivation of each volume forecast from itseconometric demand model. OCA Comments at 15, and at Attachment 1, 8 of12. The OCA's suggested language would promote the purpose underlying our proposedpreamble. Its suggestion has merit. Since it would require a detailed derivationfor all classes of mail, however, it would greatly increase the quantityof workpapers above what the Postal Service currently provides, with nocommensurate increase in information about the process. The Postal Service'sforecasting procedure is essentially the same for all classes and subclassesof mail, since it is the Postal Service's current practice to provide detailedderivations for First- and Third-class mail only. As revised, our proposedrule 54(j)(6)(i) incorporates language similar to that suggested by theOCA for rules 54(j)(5) (ii) and (iii). It is, however, more concise, andrequires the Postal Service to provide only representative derivationsfor two major mail classes, and identification of departures from thatrepresentative method for remaining classes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(e). </ITAG>As originally proposed, this rule would have required the party submittingan econometric study to provide a detailed reference to a text or manualfor each econometric technique used in the estimation process. The purposeof this proposal was to avoid the use of <T3>ad hoc </T3>techniques that the Commission would have to judge as atechnical reviewer. Technical review of a novel econometric techniques in professional journalsis a demanding and time consuming undertaking. It typically requires severallayers of expert review and revision, followed by a record of post-publicationcomments evaluating the technique before it acquires the status of an acceptableeconometric practice. Clearly, this is a difficult role for the Commissionto perform adequately within the narrow window provided by a general ratecase. The Postal Service criticized the proposed rule on the ground that theparties' hearing rights required that <T3>ad hoc </T3>econometric techniques not be restricted. Postal ServiceComments at 14-18. The FTC's Bureau of Economics also argued that <T3>ad hoc </T3>econometric techniques should not be excluded from consideration,at least where it can be shown that there are no viable alternatives. BureauComments at 12. UPS suggested that the allowable references be broadenedto include journals or university working papers. UPS Comments at 2. The OCA suggested that the proposed rule be expanded to require identificationand referencing of ``mixed'' estimation techniques that incorporate suchthings as results from hypothesis tests or other models, and could be consideredto be estimation techniques themselves. OCA Comments at 9.We have reconsidered the desirability of excluding reliance upon <T3>ad hoc</T3> econometric techniques on the grounds that they are difficultto review in the confines of a rate case. We have revised our proposedrule to allow such reliance, but to require supporting evidence sufficientfor a technical evaluation.We have revised it in this manner rather than follow the Postal Service'ssuggestion that we condition the requirement on the request for a referenceby another party, and that we allow a statement of reasons for not usinga standard econometric technique to substitute for the required reference.Postal Service Comments at 18. Although similar in intent, we think thatrequiring evidence sufficient for technical review of ad hoc techniquesto be more useful than a mere statement of the reasons that a standardtechnique was not used.The Postal Service's suggestion that the requirement should be conditionedon the request of another party is based upon the premise that the largenumber of econometric techniques used in any econometric study would makeit impractical to reference them all. <T3>Id.</T3>Perhaps we should clarify that by ``econometric technique used in the estimationprocess'' we mean only techniques used for fitting equations to data. Bythis definition, the econometric techniques used by the Postal Servicein its demand model in Docket No. R87-1 would only have involved thosehalf-dozen techniques listed in paragraphs 005-018 of Appendix H in Volume2 of our opinion. Our revised referencing proposal would, in our view,impose only a minor burden with respect to standard econometric techniques.We have not adopted the OCA's suggestion that we require a statement identifyingeach ``estimation technique'' used. We do not think that it adds materiallyto the useful information required by our revised rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rules 31(k)(2)(iii) (d) and (i), and 54(j)(7)(ii).</ITAG>A major goal of our original proposals was to ensure that the judgmentaldecisions which play such an important role in developing most econometricmodels would be preserved and presented with the submitted model. Thisgoal was to be implemented by proposed rules 31(k)(2)(iii) (<T3>d</T3>) and (<T3>i</T3>), and 54(j)(7)(ii).As initially proposed, rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>d</T3>) would have required that parties who submit econometric modelsinclude in their submission a brief description of any alternative modelswith different assumption or specifications that were tested and rejected.Proposed rule 54(j)(7)(ii) would have required that their submission includethe computer input files used to implement such alternatives. Proposedrule 31(k)(2)(iii) would have required that the computed econometric resultsof such alternatives be provided, upon request.Rules 31(k)(2)(iii) (<T3>d</T3>) and (<T3>i</T3>), as originally proposed, were intended to prompt the econometricianto keep brief notes of his explorations that culminate in the selectionof his preferred model. These would include the equation forms and variablestried, and a brief statistical expression of results. The premise of theserules was that the researcher would make such minimal notes at each decisionpoint on the path to his preferred model. Proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>i</T3>) would have required him to keep and provide the computer inputfiles used to implement rejected alternatives so that if opposing partieswished to reconstruct a particular ``experiment'' they would be able to.We are revising these proposed rules so that they will better reflect ourintent, and will more clearly indicate what documentation would have tobe preserved and provided, and the probable burden involved. Our revisionsare also meant to reduce that burden, in response to the concerns expressedby the commenters.As the comments point out, by requiring a summary description of rejectedalternatives, proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>d</T3>) did not expressly require preservation of sufficient documentationof the ``choice trail'' to illuminate technical judgments leading to theselection of the preferred model. OCA Comments at 9. We therefore haverevised proposed (iii)(<T3>d</T3>) to spell out that the minimum documentation to be retainedshould consist of an indication of why a relevant alternative was rejected,and an identification of the elements of the rejected alternative, <T3>i.e.</T3>, the variable definition, equation form, data, or estimationmethod, that differ from the preferred model.Proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>i</T3>) required that computed econometric results for any alternativescovered by proposed rule (iii)(<T3>d</T3>) be provided upon request. This rule would have required thatthe analyst be able to reproduce computed results for rejected alternatives.We are retaining this requirement in our revised proposed rules but, fordrafting purposes, we are incorporating it in our revised rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>d</T3>).We agree with the Postal Service that if the computed results for rejectedalternative models need only be provided upon request, it is unwarrantedto require mandatory production of the input files used to generate thoseresults. We have come to the conclusion that to require that such filesbe preserved for all relevant rejected alternatives could be an excessiveburden if the number of alternatives is substantial. Therefore, we aredeleting rule 54(j)(7)(ii) from our proposals. We do so with the expectationthat if an opposing party through normal discovery should request thata particular rejected alternative be reproduced, that the researcher couldrecreate such files from the notes that revised rules (iii)(<T3>d</T3>) would require him to keep.Several commenters argued that as originally proposed, rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>d</T3>) would have required descriptions of trivial or dead-end explorationsthat had no influence on the design of the submitted model, and would haveimposed a substantial and unnecessary documentation burden. Postal SrviceComments at 48-50. ANPA Comments at 2.This is a valid criticism. As revised, proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(d) explicitlylimits the alternatives that must be described to those that influencedthe selection of the preferred model. Several commenters argued that thismaterial should not be required at the outset, but only if requested bya participant. The rationale was primarily to narrow the focus to relevantalternatives, and therefore reduce the burden of complying. Postal ServiceComments at 48. OCA Comments, Attachment 1 at 4 of 12.Since our revised proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>d</T3>) is narrowed to apply only to relevant alternatives, and requiresonly a simple statement for each, we think that the documentation burdenwill now be modest. Requests for production of this minimal documentation,in our view, will be almost inevitable. Therefore, we see little to begained from the delay that would be caused by conditioning this disclosureon the request of participants. If the Postal Service is concerned thatit would have difficulty documenting the ``choice trail'' as required bythis rule because the ``trail'' was blazed long before this rule was proposed,and it did not keep and can no longer reproduce it, we will assure themthat the rule would not require them to recreate the documentation.Adopting DMA's suggestion at page 2 of its comments, we have added a statementof reasons for rejecting a relevant alternative to the disclosure requiredby revised rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>d</T3>). We agree that this will help bring the technical judgmentsmade in selecting the preferred model quickly into focus.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(j)</ITAG>Proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>j</T3>) would have allowed opposing parties or the Commission to requestthat the party submitting an econometric model compute results for specifiedvariations in its model, where it could be done by a simple ``plug-in''of different input data. The purpose was to allow other parties to investigatethe reasonableness of the judgments made in the course of the submittingparty's econometric investigation, by observing the effect of small variationsin the model.The safeguards that we contemplated were that the request be made throughthe Presiding Officer, that it include a showing of its likely value invalidating the specific judgment being probed, that the computation requestedbe simple, straightforward, and non-burdensome, and that the allowed useof the result be strictly limited to validation of the submitted model.Notice at 8. (We agree with the commenters that all of our contemplatedsafeguards should have been explicitly stated in the rule.)Several commenters objected that this procedure was not appropriate foran adversary proceeding, because it required the submitting party to helpmake its opponent's case. Postal Service Comments at 34; ANPA Commentsat 4.We think that this criticism is unfounded. Although the proposed procedureis somewhat unorthodox, it is a legitimate application of evidentiary procedures.As we discussed in connection with the adoption of our computer evidencerule, validation is an essential part of the foundation that must be laidbefore analytical models of real-world phenomena may be accepted into evidence.The burden of validating the model rests with the submitting party. Proposedrule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>j</T3>) would have provided a means of validating the submitting party'smodel where the submitting party has not carried its burden in the eyesof the Presiding Officer. Where the submitting party had already adequatelydocumented the behavior of the model relative to plausible alternatives,as proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>d</T3>) contemplates, opposing parties would have had difficulty demonstratingto the Presiding Officer the likely value of their request in validatingthe model.The Postal Service objected that we would not, as a practical matter, beable to restrict this procedure to its intended validating function. Itargued that if an opposing party wished to base an affirmative case uponthe alternative computation that it requested, that we could not preventit from using the result in that manner. Postal Service Comments at 34-35.We see no reason that this should be true. If the evidence is allowed inthe record for a restricted purpose, we are fully able to respect thatrestriction in our deliberations, especially where the submitting partyis diligent in reminding us of the restriction.A more legitimate criticism of proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>j</T3>), in our view, is that it might spawn excessive litigation ofthe issue of the appropriateness of requests. ANPA Comments at 5.We recognize that proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>j</T3>) is a ``second-best'' solution. Several commenters have pointedout that, ideally, the validation and testing functions of proposed rule31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>j</T3>) could be performed by opposing parties themselves, if the submittedmodel is documented in the manner that our other rules would require. PostalService Comments at 36; ANPA Comments at 4-5.We agree that if our proposed rules governing econometric studies and ourcurrent computer evidence rule (rule 31(k)(3)) are faithfully compliedwith, this should be possible. We have decided to defer further considerationof proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>j</T3>) until we have had a chance, over the next rate cycle, to evaluatethe adequacy of the balance of our rules to accomplish the purpose underlyingthis proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sensitivity Tests</ITAG>Providing for validating sensitivity tests was the main purpose of proposedrule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>j</T3>). The FTC's Bureau of Economics proposed that we require partiesto submit sensitivity tests with their econometric models, to provide anindication of the robustness of the results. Bureau Comments at 11.We agree that this is standard practice for good econometrics, and it isour strong preference that econometric studies offered in evidence in ourhearings be accompanied by such tests. But it seems to us that not muchwould be gained from a rule requiring, in the abstract, that sensitivitytests be performed. That requirement would be open-ended, and likely toelicit only self-servingly selective sensitivity tests. It would be verydifficult to try to specify in advance a standard set of sensitivity teststo counter this tendency. Useful sensitivity tests would likely only bethose that a party voluntarily presents because they confirm the robustnessof its results, or those that, as in proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(<T3>j</T3>), would be specified by opposing parties after seeing the designof the model submitted. We would, nevertheless, entertain comments on amore specific proposal to require sensitivity tests.<ITAG tagnum="84">Seasonal Adjustment Requirements (Proposed Rules 54(j)(5)(iv), 54(j)(7)(iv),and 102(b)(5))</ITAG>Proposed rule 54(j)(5)(iv) would have required the Postal Service to provide,as part of its filing, observed and estimated quarterly volumes in seasonallyadjusted form, at annual rates. Proposed rule 54(j)(7)(iv) would have requiredit to provide the input files and computer programs used to make seasonaladjustments. Proposed rule 102(b)(5) would require the Postal Service toseasonally adjust the quarterly volume updates called for in that proposedrule for ongoing data reporting.The Postal Service devoted a considerable portion of its comments objectingto these proposals, if they are construed to impose a requirement thatdeseasonalized data be incorporated in its econometric method. Postal ServiceComments at 25-32. It stated at the end of its discussion, however, thatif these proposals merely require it to perform a seasonal conversion afterits forecast is made, that it would comply with them, despite its skepticismas to their value. <T3>Id. </T3>at 33.We did, indeed, intend that the Postal Service would be free under theseproposals to perform the seasonal conversion after its forecast is made.Our proposals were not intended to affect its forecasting method, but merelythe presentation of its results.The Postal Service has argued that to present its volume data in seasonallyadjusted form would be a complex and burdensome effort. Presumably thePostal Service could find among the wide array of government and commercialsoftware packages available for the task, one that it considered suitablefor converting its data. But presenting results in seasonally adjustedform is not central to our overall objectives in revising our volume evidencerules. The proposal was merely intended to make it easier for all participantsto recognize volume trends and to evaluate the accuracy of volume forecasts.Because the Postal Service insists that it would be a complex and burdensometask, we have decided to delete requirements for seasonally adjusted datafrom our revised proposed rules. We believe, however, that seasonally adjusteddata allows us to directly compare observations and forecasts for adjacentquarters, as an aid in evaluating the reasonableness of forecasts overthe near term. For this reason it is likely that we would request someseasonally adjusted volume data in the next rate proceeding, even thoughit would not be required by rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rules 54(j)(5) (ii) and (iii) </ITAG>These proposed rules would require the Postal Service to extend its before-and after-rates forecast one year beyond the test year. The Postal Serviceargues that since we only recommend rates for the test year, events afterthe test year are irrelevant. It argues that how reasonable a model's predictionof those events is, and consistent its post-test year prediction is withits test year prediction, are not relevant to our proceedings. Postal ServiceComments at 47.Of course predicting events for the year after the test year is not thedirect purpose of our proceedings. But how a predictive model behaves ifit is incrementally extended beyond the test year certainly has a bearingon the reasonableness of its test-year prediction. If a model predictedmodest growth in volume for a major mail class through the test year, buta pronounced decline for the following year, the post test-year predictionwould undermine the credibility of the model's test-year prediction, inthe absence of a change in external variables that would explain the reversalof the trend.The Postal Service's argument that a model's predictions for periods outsidethe test year are irrelevant to evaluating its test-year predictions couldbe applied with equal force to the interim years. Surely the Postal Servicewould agree that the performance of its forecasting model in the interimperiod reflects upon the probable accuracy of its test-year forecast, andthat such information is properly required by our current rules, even thoughwe do not recommend new rates for the interim period.The relevance of a post test-year forecast in evaluating a test-year forecastcan be illustrated on a common sense level by referring to our experiencein Docket No. R84-1. There observed volumes for Bulk Rate Regular Mailfor the interim period were running substantially above the Postal Service'sestimated volumes for the test year. If the Postal Service's forecast hadextended to the year beyond the test year, its underestimation of test-yearBulk Rate Regular volumes would have become apparent to all of the participantsmuch earlier in the proceeding. This would have facilitated the task ofcorrecting the forecast.That a model's volume forecast for the year beyond the test year wouldbe useful in evaluating its forecast for the test year itself, can be demonstratednot only on a common sense level, but on a technical level. The forecastingmodel that the Postal Service has been using incorporates price effectswith lags of up to one year. This means that transition effects from newrates persist into the test year. It is important that we be able to viewand evaluate the impact of new rates free of transition effects. This cannotbe done without a forecast of volumes for some reasonable period beyondthe test year. Under the Postal Service's current model, one year is sufficientto insure that transition effects are gone.For these reasons we have not revised proposed rules 54(j)(5) (ii) and(iii).<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule 54(j)(5)(v) </ITAG>Proposed rule 54(j)(5)(v) would have required the Postal Service to presentconfidence intervals for its volume forecasts. We are aware that the modelthat Postal Service has been using is not ideally suited to calculatingan unambiguous confidence interval for many reasons, including those thatthe Postal Service points out in its comments.The Postal Service argues both that a meaningful confidence interval cannotbe calculated for its forecasts, and that the exercise would be burdensome.Postal Service Comments at 43-46. With the variance/covariance matrix ofthe estimates included in its documentation, opposing parties should beable to calculate confidence intervals and other statistical tests forthemselves. For these reasons we are deleting this requirement from ourrevised proposed rules.<ITAG tagnum="84">Updating Volume-Related Data, Proposed Rules 102(b) (4) and (5) </ITAG>Proposed rules 102(b) (4) and (5) would have added to the Postal Service'songoing data reporting obligations, requirements that it provide currentextensions and revisions in the values of all explanatory variables usedin its econometric demand study from the most recent rate proceeding, andcurrent extensions and revisions of the unadjusted and seasonally adjustedactual quarterly volumes provided in the most recent rate proceeding.The Postal Service objects to these proposed additions on the ground thatthey impose an excessive burden, since it does not update the input variablesto its demand model between rate cases, and does not seasonally adjustits volume data. It contends that all of these updates come from publiclyavailable sources, and, with the ``turn-key'' computer implementation thatit will provide, the parties will be able to perform the requested updatesthemselves. Postal Service Comments at 51-52.If the Postal Service doesn't update the explanatory variables in its demandmodel on a regular basis, then the requirement in rule 102(b)(4) as originallyproposed is not likely to assist us in keeping our data current with respectto demand analysis. It would be useful, however, to obtain updated informationfrom which price indices could be calculated.A single class or subclass of mail typically consists of mail categorieswith different characteristics, such as zone distance or presort level,used to determine the postage paid by the mailer. Becuase of the plethoraof rate categories, the Postal Service constructs price indices for subclassesto be used in the estimation of its econometric models. These indices areusually calculated as a weighted average of the rates that apply to categorieswithin the subclass. In Docket Nos. R84-1 and R87-1, the Postal Serviceconstructed price indices for every major class and subclass of mail, andused these indices in their econometrics and forecasting.Billing determinants contain disaggregated volume and revenue informationthat is representative of the rate categories for each subclass of mail.This level of disaggregation is greater than that provided in the RPW reports.This disaggregation is necessary in order to construct price indices bythe method that the Postal Service currently uses. The Postal Service isthe only source of the detailed information needed to produce the billingdeterminants from which price indices must be calculated. Therefore, aneed remains for updated billing determinants to allow interested partiesto analyze volumes on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, although we are deletingproposed rule 102(b)(4) from our revised proposals, we propose that billingdeterminants be added to the list of annual data reports required fromthe Postal Service under rule 102(a).We are also deleting rule 102(b)(5) from our revised proposal. As discussedabove in connection with proposed rules 54(j) (5)(iv) and (7)(iv), we aredeleting requirements that the Postal Service present volume data in seasonallyadjusted form from our revised proposed rules, in responses to the PostalService's objections to the burden that it would impose. If billing determinantswere provided under our proposed rule 102(a)(10), they would contain volumeinformation at the level of detail that rule 102(b)(5) was intended toelicit (although only on an annual basis for some categories of mail).This comes close enough to the objective of proposed rule 102(b)(5) toprompt us to delete it from our revised proposals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(g)(VI)</ITAG>This rule would have required that computed residuals be provided for everyeconometric study submitted. The Postal Service points out that this requirementis reasonable unless large databases are involved. It suggests either thatthe requirement be conditioned upon a request from other parties, or thatit be applicable only to studies involving less than some maximum numberof observations. Postal Service Comments at 54. Because we anticipate thatrequests for the residuals would almost always be made, we have adoptedthe second of its suggestions, and limited the requirement to studies involvingfewer than 250 observations.ANPA proposed that the reports of econometric results required by proposedrule ``(g)'' include the date, and identification of the name and versionof the software package used. ANPA Comments at 3. We have decided not toadopt its suggestion. We are not sure why requiring a date for the reportwould be useful. Requiring identification of the software used might havesome value, but is more appropriately considered in connection with amendmentsto rule 31(k)(3), our computer evidence rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Track Record for Postal Service Forecasting Model</ITAG>The FTC's Bureau of Economics proposed that we amend rule 54 to requirethe Postal Service to submit econometric analyses indicating the reliabilityof previous Postal Service models in predicting demand, and the reliabilityof its current model in predicting past changes in demand, using historicaldata. The purpose of its proposal is to help assess the reliability orbias of Postal Service forecasting models. Bureau Comments at 12.We agree, in principle, that being able to demonstrate a track record ofconsistent and accurate forecasts is very important to establishing thecredibility of a demand forecasting model. Indeed, a meaningful track recordis one of the few reliable ways of establishing the credibility of a forecastingmodel where, as with the Postal Service's current model, judgmental ``addfactors'' have a large impact on the result.A meaningful track record can be demonstrated for models that are continuouslymaintained, and have been implemented numerous times on a regular basis,as the national macroeconomic models are. Such models tend to be modifiedonly in a very gradual evolutionary manner, so that the performance ofthe previous version remains a meaningful indicator of the reliabilityof the current version.The model that the Postal Service currently uses, however, seems not tobe exercised between rate cases. Based upon all that is publicly known,it has only been implemented three times, and has been significantly alteredeach of those times. Its performance over those three implementations hasbeen mixed, with some significant misestimations occurring in the DocketNo. R84-1 implementation. If there were only a few, discontinuous implementationsof significantly altered versions, we are not sure how meaningful the trackrecord presented under the Bureau's proposal would be. We would, nevertheless,entertain comments on a proposal that is more specifically framed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Proposed Rules</ITAG>We have adopted the Postal Service's suggestion that we substitute thewords ``In addition'' for ``For example'' in the third sentence of thepreamble to our proposed rule 31(k)(2), in order to make it clear thatthe material covered by the balance of the rule is to be provided simultaneouslywith the submitted study. We have also adopted its suggestion that we deletefrom the preamble that portion which would have permitted parties to requestthat stuides not initially submitted in computerized form be convertedto computerized form.``Statistical studies'' in the preamble to rule 31(k)(2)(iii) is not expresslydefined. That term is therefore understood in the ordinary ``textbook''sense to apply to studies that draw inference from data. The OCA proposesthat a definition of the term ``statistical studies'' be expressly includedin the preamble that would appear to go considerably beyond the normaldefinition. It proposes to define them as ``all analyses that make useof formulas, or deterministic models, in the characterization or projectionof data.'' Nonparametric statistics are apparently excluded from this definition.Deterministic models clearly are not within the ordinary definition ofstatistical studies. By including all studies that use formulas to characterizedata, the OCA's proposed definition could include what would normally beconsidered operations research.We prefer not to extend the definiton of statistical studies to includethose suggested by the OCA. In our view, they do not share the unique,common properties that we associate with statistical studies, as that termis traditionally understood. To try to stretch this rule to include themwould, we think, risk requiring inappropriate kinds of documentation forsuch studies.The specific purpose that the OCA cites for its proposal is to have adquatedocumentation requirements apply to the Postal Service's calculation ofpresort shares. OCA Comments at 3. Our other proposed rules (31(k)(2)(iii)<T3>(f)</T3>; 54 (j)(6) preamble, and (iii); 54 (j)(7)(ii)) should be adequateto obtain thorough documentation of these calculations.The OCA proposes that we amend proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)<T3>(c)</T3> to require that the submitting party justify not only theselection of variables in its study but their functional form as well,in order to illuminate hidden assumptions in the study. Comments at 8.In our view, essentially the same information already would be requiredas part of the specification of the model under proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)<T3>(b)</T3>. For this reason we have not adopted the OCA's suggestion.ANPA and the OCA suggest that we add to proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)(f)a provision whereby parties may request a complete listing of input datato assist them in replicating submitted econometric studies. ANPA Commentsat 3; OCA Comments at 10. This would already be required for econometricstudies to which our computer evidence rule (rule 31(k)(3)) applies. Webelieve that the ability to replicate econometric studies is so important,however, that we will include it in proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)<T3>(f)</T3> as well.The OCA suggests that we amend proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)<T3>(f)</T3> to require that all computations that combine input data withother information for further analysis be provided, to aid in the analysisof such things as the Postal Service's price indices in its demand study.OCA Comments at 10. We have adopted this suggestion by adding transformationsof data to the documentation required under the revised rule.The OCA suggests that we expand proposed rule 31(k)(2)(iii)<T3>(h)</T3> to require that statistical tests of hypotheses concerningthe functioning form of the model, or the model's parameter constraints,be provided. It criticizes the Postal Service for often having employeduntested parameter constraints. OCA Comments at 11. We do not believe thatmaking such tests mandatory is appropriate. Functional forms, as such,are usually received hypotheses not capable of an econometric test. Accordinglywe have not adopted the OCA's suggestion.The OCA suggests that we amend proposed rule 54(j)(5)(i) to require thePostal Service to document its econometric demand study in sufficient detailto allow parties to replicate it, regardless of whether they have the exactsoftware application that the Postal Service used. OCA Comments at 14.We agree that such detail should be provided, and have required it alreadyin proposed rule 54(j)(7)(i). Because it would be redundant to add it toproposed rule 54(j)(5)(i), we have not adopted the OCA's suggestion.UPS suggests that we add to proposed rule 54(j)(7)(i) a requirement thatcommercially available software programs used to implement the econometricdemand study be identified, and the instructions given to the softwareprogram be identified. UPS Comments at 3. This requirement is probablynot appropriate for studies conducted in an interactive computer environment.We have not adopted UPS's suggestion because we believe that the terms``input files and programs'' is already well defined, and the informationthat UPS seeks is already required under our computer evidence rule.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 3001_RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE</ITAG>1.
