(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The walls of Dr. Robert K. Graham'srelatively ordinary-looking office are lined with the pictures ofdozens of babies he says are far from ordinary _ the products ofthe so-called Nobel Prize sperm bank.   They are the children born to mothers inseminated with``superior'' sperm provided by 8-year-old Graham's Repository forGerminal Choice. The bank claims responsibility for 55 babies, and18 women are pregnant.   Graham, 81, a multimillionaire who developed the shatterproofeyeglass lens, is on a mission to save the human species. Superiorgenes are being lost, he says, because society's smartest don'thave enough children while the masses proliferate with zeal.   He says his program is working, that most of the childrendevelop at a much faster rate than their peers and are judgedgifted. Geneticists, however, still find fault, saying the programminimizes women's role in reproduction and exaggerates thelikelihood children will inherit all their parents' good genes.   But the proud parents cheer Graham for bringing them brightchildren they deserved but couldn't have, usually because thefather was infertile.   ``I just wanted to have a child,'' said Adrienne Ramm, a dancerfrom New York City whose daughter Leandra turned 4 on Wednesday.``I believe that the donor sprem was from a man that seemed to be agreat human being. We were increasing our chances of having abright and healthy child.''   When Graham opened his repository, critics ranging fromfeminists to communists and the Roman Catholic church denounced itas a ``master race'' plan reminiscent of Adolf Hitler. Thecontroversy was fueled by Nobel Prize winner William Shockley'srevelation that he was a donor and by Graham's own views.   Shockley, a physicist who invented the junction transistor,believed that certain races were genetically disposed to beintellectually inferior.   Alexander Capron, a former member of President Reagan'sCommission on Bio-ethics, has concerns with the repository, butgratefully notes ``it hasn't become a major force in reproduction.''   The identities of Graham's donors are withheld. The listincludes two Nobelists and an Olympian. All are of European descentor Jewish, and most are California scientists. Graham says blacksand Asians have refused to donate.   Donors are declared of good health and genetic ancestry, and thesperm is screened for the AIDS virus.   Applicant parents must show they are married, intelligent,emotionally and financially stable, with a clean physical andmental health history. The mother must be under age 38. About halfthe applicants are rejected.   When they had Leandra, Adrienne and David Ramm chose afair-haired science professor of European roots described as lovinggardening, skiing and children. For their second child, due nextmonth, they chose the Olympic athlete.   Graham requires annual reports from parents, but is frustratedthat his experiment lacks rigid scientific standards because thedonors and parents vary and the children are raised in differentenvironments. But he added, ``The general consequences of bright,happy kids is good enough for me.''</TEXT><HEAD>Bizarre Child Abuse Disorder Probably Often Overlooked, Experts</HEAD><TEXT>   Say</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The boy's mother said he had cystic fibrosis,and so did the lab tests. The real disease was more bizarre, and itlay within the mother.   No parent could have been more dedicated during the 5-year-old'shospital stays. She stayed with him around the clock and oftenhelped nurses giving him medications. But doctors eventuallyrealized she also altered his stool and perspiration samples tomatch cystic fibrosis symptoms.   She even tried to cast doubt on a test result, and tricked areal cystic fibrosis patient into giving her a sputum sample, thensubmitted it to doctors.   Her case is an elaborate example of a psychiatric disordercalled ``Munchausen's syndrome by proxy,'' a variant ofMunchausen's syndrome, in which a person fakes disease to getmedical care. In Munchausen's by proxy, a mother typically producesdisease or the appearance of disease in her child, then acts likethe model of a dedicated and concerned parent.   The disorder is probably relatively rare, but ``we suspect it'smore common than we think because it's so very difficult torecognize,'' said David Waller, director of child and adolescentpsychiatry at the University of Texas Soutwestern Medical Center inDallas.   Such behavior appears to be a way to signal distress, orhostility against doctors and society, experts say. And the mother``gets a lot of reward from being seen as a wonderful, caringparent in her role as helping the child get good medical care,''Waller said.   ``People who do it once will do it again consistently,'' usuallysingling out a child for what mother and child consider a game,said Theodore Nadelson, chief of psychiatry at the VeteransAdministration Medical Center in Boston.   Treatment is difficult because people deny they have a problem.</TEXT><HEAD>New Program Aims To Stop Decline In Fitness Of American Youth</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new school exercise program that replacescompetition with individual tests and health education couldreverse the decline in fitness among American children whilehelping them avoid injury, experts say.   The American College of Sports Medicine is just starting topromote the program, called Fit Youth Today, or FYT, which wasdeveloped with the support of the American Health and FitnessFoundation in Austin, Texas.   FYT does not favor natural athletes. It rewards each student forattaining his or her fitness goals, whatever the level of athleticability, said Wiliam Squires, professor of health fitness andnutrition at Texas Lutheran College and chairman of the task forcethat developed FYT. It also teaches students about the importanceof maintaining physical activity throughout life.   Less than 50 percent of American children have adequateheart-lung endurance, and 40 percent of those 5-8 years old havesigns of elevated blood pressure, obesity or elevated cholesterol _all of which increase the risk of heart disease, Squires said.``The decline in youth fitness is real and is overwhelminglysupported by study after study.''   In conventional programs, students are often measured againstnorms set by their peers. FYT conditions them not to run faster orjump higher than others but to be able to jog a set distance in 20minutes, perform certain exercises demonstrating strength andflexibility, and reduce body fat specified levels.   The key point is that the goals emphasize aerobic fitness,strength and weight loss _ not maximum performance, Squires said.   Children are unusually susceptible ``overuse injuries,'' fromexercise without proper conditioning and training, said Dr. LyleMicheli, an orthopedist and director of sports medicine atChildren's Hospital in Boston.   ``Is running good for kids? Absolutely,'' he said. ``Is too muchrunning bad for kids? Absolutely. The question is how much is toomuch.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 28</NOTE></DOC>
