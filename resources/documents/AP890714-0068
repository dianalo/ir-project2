Paul J. Gallagher of the police force in suburbanNorth Andover said Thursday.   Meanwhile, the California Senate on Thursday approved aresolution urging Congress to pass a constitutional amendmentagainst flag burning, a move already endorsed by President Bush. Thestate Assembly passed a similar measure last month.   North Carolina's Senate passed by 47-0 a bill backed by Gov. JimMartin that would revise the state's flag desecration law, making ita misdemeanor to destroy or mutilate an American or North Carolinaflag except for disposal purposes.   Martin said the bill would not violate last month's U.S. SupremeCourt ruling that flag burning is protected by the Constitution'sfreedom of speech guarantee. The bill was modeled after a measureproposed by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and, unlike the Texas lawstruck down by the high court, it does not refer to conduct thatcould seriously offend people.   In Austin, the Texas House passed without objection an amendmentto an anti-flag desecration bill that would extend criminalpenalties for desecration to flags of all U.S. states andterritories, in addition to Old Glory and the Texas flag.   In Massachusetts, police charged Jack T. Fredyma of maliciousdestruction of property, a felony punishable by up to 2{ years injail, rather than desecration of a national symbol.   The key to the case is that Fredyma allegedly burned someoneelse's flag, not his own. The Supreme Court ruling ``doesn't giveyou the right to take someone else's flag and burn it,'' Gallaghersaid.   Fredyma allegedly took down a 5-by-8-foot flag in front ofAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s plant in North AndoverWednesday night, then set it on fire and ran it back up the flagpole.   The 27-year-old man worked at the plant from January 1985 untillast October and apparently was expressing anger at ATandamp;T, Gallaghersaid.   Fredyma pleaded innocent Wednesday in Lawrence District Court,and the case was continued until Oct. 16. He declined to comment onthe charge Thursday but said he was fired by ATandamp;T after complainingabout environmental hazards in the company's darkrooms, a claim thecompany denies.   Fredyma also faces federal charges of using the mail to makephysical threats against his former supervisors.   According to an FBI affidavit filed in the case, he sent a June 1letter to the Boston office of the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration in which he accused top ATandamp;T officials of being``traitors against the U.S. Constitution and its people'' andthreatened to ``use deadly force against these traitors.''   Walter Murphy, an ATandamp;T spokesman in New York, said the companywould not comment.</TEXT></DOC>
