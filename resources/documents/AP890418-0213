Police used no force and no arrests were reported as thedemonstrators left peacefully.   The police action at least temporarily ended more than two daysof marches and demonstrations by thousands of students in Beijingand Shanghai demanding more democracy.   About 1,500 demonstrators were milling outside the ornate gateof Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the Communist Party, whenpolice arrived in jeeps at 4:20 a.m.   The police formed a line across the six lanes of ChanganBoulevard, the capital's main thoroughfare, and began walkingtoward the students.   ``To march on the seat of government is illegal and cannot bepermitted,'' said a loudspeaker mounted on a truck. It said thepeople of Beijing ``love and remember'' former Communist Partychief Hu Yaobang, but ``some people have been using his death tocarry out irregular activities.''   Hu, 73, died Saturday and his death brought about thedemonstrations and memorial marches. Hu, considered a liberal, wasousted from power in early 1987 for failing to stop pro-democracystudent rallies in 1986-87.   About 3,000 demonstrators had gathered in front of ZhongnanhaiTuesday, but the crowd had dwindled to about half that when policemoved in.   The police provided two buses for students and a few boarded thevehicles while the others walked back toward their universities,followed by policemen. The demonstrators offered no resistance.   ``Getting arrested in China is not like getting arrested inAmerica,'' one student said. ``Here your whole life is ruined.''   Although no arrests were reported, students said three of theirrepresentatives who entered Zhongnanhai had not left the compound.   Shortly after midnight some of the students had tried to forcetheir way into the walled complex, and they were shoved backrepeatedly by dozens of plainclothes policemen.   Flowered wreaths honoring Hu and carried by some students weretorn to pieces in the struggle.   The student rallies began Monday and early Tuesday when about2,000 students from Beijing University and other schools marchedfour hours to place banners on a monument to revolutionary heroesin Tiananmen Square.   Wreath-carrying students from other colleges paraded to themonument throughout the day Tuesday, and hundreds of studentsstaged a daylong sit-in in front of the Great Hall of the People,demanding freedom of speech and press and public disclosures of theincomes of officials.   They chanted ``Long live democracy!'' and ``Down withdictatorship!'' Repeatedly they sang the ``Internationale'' asocalist anthem.   They also shouted, ``Come out Li Peng!''   Li, China's premier, recently rejected rapid political reforms,saying too much democracy would lead to political instability.   Late Tuesday the students marched around the square in a rallythat swelled to about 10,000 people, including bystanders. Many ofthe demonstrators walked for about 300 yards down Changan Boulevardto Zhongnanhai while others left the procession.   ``This is the most serious demonstration in the past 10 years,''said one student who took part in the 1986-87 demonstrations. ``Wedid not come here (to Zhongnanhai) then because it is sosensitive.''   It was the first major demonstration at Zhongnanhai since the1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when radical youths known as RedGuards tried to enter the walled compound to drag out leaders theyaccused of capitalist crimes.   In Tiananmen, the 100-acre plaza that is the symbolic center ofpower in China, many peasants, other workers and young people hadjoined the students.   Some bystanders expressed support but said they doubted therallies for democracy would achieve anything and economic issueswere more important.   ``You can't eat democracy,'' said one worker who complainedabout inflation now at a rate of more than 30 percent in somecities.   Some student leaders issued seven demands and asked for arepresentative from the National People's Congress, the parliament,to meet with them.   The demands were for a reassessment of Hu's role, an end toanti-liberal political campaigns, revealing the incomes of leaders,freedom of speech and press, better pay for intellectuals, an endto a ban on demonstrations and news coverage of the student rallies.   Administrative officials from the Congress who met studentrepresentatives Tuesday refused to accept the demands and told thedemonstrators to go home.</TEXT></DOC>
