On other markets, pork belly futures plunged while livestockfutures were mixed; soybeans advanced while grains were mixed;energy futures were mostly lower; and stock index futures advanced.   Metals analysts said the stronger dollar may have had somenegative impact on precious metals markets but not enough to fullyexplain the plunge in gold futures, which lost as much as $6.10 atroy ounce during the session.   ``I wasn't expecting a sell-off today of this sort ofmagnitude,'' said Richard Levine, vice president of the metals andforeign exchange group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.   Analyst Craig Sloane of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. said agovernment report showing virtually no change last month in factoryorders for durable goods was somewhat disappointing, but also washardly enough to spark Friday's decline in metals.   ``There's been no real negative news,'' he said. ``I guessthere's just been nothing exciting going on and the market has soldoff and just kind of fed on itself for a while.''   Another analyst, Bernard Savakl of PaineWebber Inc., linked thesell-off to talk of Japanese sales of platinum and governmentconcern over Taiwanese purchases of gold.   Gold settled $4.50 to $6.10 lower with the contract for deliveryin June at $452.40 a troy ounce; silver was 4.5 cents to 5.3 centslower with May at $6.415 a troy ounce.   Pork belly futures plunged as much as 1.32 cents a pound on theChicago Mercantile Exchange on expectations that a monthlygovernment report issued after the close would show a largeincrease in the number of bellies in cold storage. The assumptionwas correct.   The Agriculture Department counted about 90.5 million pounds offrozen pork bellies at the end of March, an increase of nearly 23.5million pounds during the month and the third-largest March 31total on record.   Analyst Chuck Levitt said the report would have little marketimpact since it matched expectations.   But two other USDA reports issued Friday _ the monthly andquarterly cattle-on-feed reports _ will likely send cattle futures50 to 100 points lower on Monday, Levitt said.   The quarterly report showed a 6 percent increase since last yearin the total number of cattle being fattened for slaughter, a 2percent rise in placements on feedlots during the first quarter anda 1 percent increase in cattle marketings.   The monthly report also showed greater-than-expected numbers ofcattle on feed, higher-than-expected placements andlower-than-expected marketings.   ``No matter how you cut it, first quarter placements appear tobe the largest on record and that has to take some kind of toll inthe marketplace,'' Levitt said.   Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with Juneat 70.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .48 centhigher with April at 79.97 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lowerto .23 cent higher with June at 48.75 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were .60 cent to 1.32 cents lower with May at 52.02 cents apound.   Soybean futures closed sharply higher on the Chicago Board ofTrade as weather forecasters reduced their predictions for nextweek's rainfall. The grains were mixed.   Long-range forecasts issued Thursday predicted good amounts ofrain next week in the Midwest and Great Plains, where corn andsoybean planting is beginning and rain is needed to get the cropsoff to a good start. Prices fell Thursday in reaction to theforecasts.   But new forecasts Friday predicted lesser amounts of rain, andthe markets rallied on the news, analysts said.   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $3.15 abushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to 1} cents higher with May at$2.01\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with Mayat $1.64{ a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 6{ cents higher withMay at $6.63{ a bushel.   Energy futures settled mostly lower on the New York MercantileExchange in nervous trading ahead of next week's meeting of OPECand non-OPEC oil producers, analysts said.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 6 centslower with June at $18.30 a barrel; heating oil was .14 cent lowerto .11 cent higher with May at 50.60 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .16 cent lower to .10 cent higher with May at 52.29cents a gallon.   Stock-index futures posted strong gains on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of theStandard andamp; Poor's 500 index settled 5.65 points higher at 261.85.</TEXT></DOC>
