Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer, is accused of fatally beating the6-year-old girl he and his live-in companion, Hedda Nussbaum, hadillegally obtained at birth from a Long Island teen-ager and raisedas their own.   The death of Lisa Steinberg, raised in an upper-middle-classfamily, has focused a new light on the issue of child abuse, and thecase has received international attention.   Jurors began their eighth day of deliberations today, amidspeculation that they had acquitted Steinberg of second-degreemurder and were considering the less serious charges of first- andsecond-degree manslaughter.   Steinberg faces four charges: second-degree murder; first-degreemanslaughter; second-degree manslaughter, and criminally negligenthomicide.   Steinberg grinned broadly as he entered the courtroom shortlybefore 8 p.m. Sunday, when the judge sent the jurors home for theevening. Several hours earlier, the jury had sent out a note askingfor clarification of the terms ``intent'' and ``serious physicalinjury'' _ elements of manslaughter.   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax had told jurors not toconsider manslaughter unless they unanimously acquitted Steinberg ofsecond-degree murder.   Defense lawyer Ira London said Steinberg, 47, feels the jury isgiving him ``a fair shake. ... What we feel good about is that thishas not been a lynching.''   At 11 a.m., the jury began rehearing about two hours' worth oftestimony they had requested concerning Steinberg's actions betweenthe time Lisa was injured on Nov. 1, 1987, and the next morning,when Emergency Medical Service workers were called and took Lisa toa hospital, where she died several days later.   That testimony includes statements from police officers, EMSworkers and hospital employees who had testified about Steinberg'sexplanations for Lisa's condition and his reaction to her prognosis.   The jury also specifically asked to rehear Ms. Nussbaum'stestimony of what happened the night Lisa was injured. Among otherthings, Ms. Nussbaum testified that Steinberg told her he hit Lisa,which he has denied.   The last note the jury sent out Sunday indicated that they wereconsidering the possibility that there was no intent on Steinberg'spart to cause injury to Lisa.   Second-degree manslaughter does not include an element of intent,but is the reckless disregard of a substantial risk of death toanother, such as Steinberg's delay in getting medical help for Lisa.   First-degree manslaughter is applicable when a person intends toseriously injure someone and in the process, the victim dies.</TEXT></DOC>
