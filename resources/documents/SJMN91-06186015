Apple, right down to its rainbow-colored logo,has sold itself as the hip, innovative maker of &quot;insanely great&quot; computers for&quot;the rest of us.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BUSINESS REALITIES PAIRED UP ODD COUPLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See related stories pages 1A of this section and page 1G.  </MEMO><TEXT>     But Apple insiders and industry watchers say the cocky and fanatical Appleof the days of departed co-founder Steve Jobs has slowly metamorphosed into afar more businesslike and pragmatic company.;    It is a far cry from thecompany that, when it introduced the Macintosh personal computer in 1984, rana television ad that caricatured then-IBM Chairman John Opel as a shadowy &quot;BigBrother&quot; figure. A year later, Apple ran an even cockier ad that depictedIBM's customers as blindfolded lemmings pitching off a cliff.;    Until newsof the potential partnership leaked out three weeks ago, the prospect of thetwo companies joining seemed so outlandish that the notion that Apple Chairmanand CEO John Sculley was an IBM &quot;mole&quot; sent to infiltrate and subvert IBM'scompetitor was made the premise of a novel by a former adviser to Sculley.;   But Apple has changed, observers said.;    It has a new leadership style.Pepsi marketer Sculley ousted Jobs. And last year, Apple pushed out theflamboyant Jean-Louis Gassee, who vowed Apple would never consider licensingits key software to anyone, and brought in the dour Michael Spindler, whopromptly reversed the stance.;    The company's once-legendary parties,featuring huge budgets and big-name rock bands, have given way to fiscalrestraint, from a lowering of the company's salary structure to the layoff of1,500 workers.;    These changes have come in response to tough competition.While the user interface of the Macintosh is now imitated on nearly everycomputer, including many of IBM's, Apple has managed to capture only about 12percent of the personal computer market.;    Faced with those realities, evensome longtime programmers and engineers, the die-hard adherents of the Apple&quot;religion&quot; preached by Jobs, are now willing to accept an alliance with acompany that was once their sworn enemy.;    &quot;The Apple that has been evolvingsince Spindler became (chief operating officer) is willing to reconsider andquestion some of its traditional positions,&quot; said Bud Colligan, a former Appleexecutive under Jobs and now president of Authorware of Redwood City.;    Butthe change of heart is far from universal and could spell problems for thealliance. Many of Apple's most creative employees deeply believe that they areinnovators, while IBM produces far more pedestrian products. To them, workingwith IBM can only mean painful compromises and a loss of enthusiasm for theirwork.;    &quot;For a lot of people, the reaction is confusion, bewilderment,&quot; saidone veteran Apple employee who asked not to be named. &quot;Many people'spredisposition to things IBM is that they are the epitome of everything Appleis against.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RORY J.
