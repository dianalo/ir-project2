In February 1986, President Reagan nominated my brotherDan to serve on the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.The Senate had a Republican majority at the time, and atfirst the nomination seemed safe. But my brother'sconservative credentials made his nomination a liberal causecelebre; one prominent Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,who still serves there today, began calling contacts in ourhome state of Indiana, at Notre Dame (Dan's alma mater andmine), and all over Washington, with one common question:&quot;Can't you help us get something on Dan Manion?&quot; The senatorwas so frantic that several of those he called turned out tobe friends of our family -- a couple had actually writtenimportant endorsements for Dan. But this only inspired thetar-and-feather crew to redouble its efforts.</LP><TEXT>   On June 26, 1986, Dan's nomination survived a close voteon the Senate floor. Majority Leader Bob Dole put off thefinal vote to await a sure majority, and opponents knew thatdelay might last for weeks, even months. Given that breathingspace, they began stage two -- the now-familiar &quot;back-doorleak&quot; attack.   I had been a Senate staffer for five years when mybrother's nomination was debated. In mid-July, when no finalvote on his nomination was in sight, the Senate IntelligenceCommittee suddenly received a report that I had leakedclassified information from one of its briefings. The chargewas serious, and the committee chairman and co-chairman tookthe unusual step of asking the FBI to investigate theallegations.   What followed is very interesting, in the light of JudgeThomas's latest experience. Within days of the allegations tothe Intelligence Committee, the same Democratic opponent ofmy brother's nomination on the Judiciary Committee heardabout my alleged leak. According to a source on theIntelligence Committee, he quickly asked for and received abriefing on it.   Within that same week, news of the FBI's investigation ofme was leaked to the media (I have no way of knowing wholeaked it). Journalists began digging for sources willing toconfirm the leak, and, by early August, had enough to run thestory. But it was too late to derail Dan's nomination: Itpassed on July 23 and was sent to the president.   The leak about the leak, however, had taken on a life ofits own. On Aug. 4 the press surrounded my house and myoffice, and of course, like Judge Thomas, I could saynothing. I kept my clearances and stayed on the job, but itwas only 15 months later that I was publicly cleared. InOctober of 1987, the FBI finding that &quot;no leak occurred&quot; wasconfirmed by the Justice Department and made public by theIntelligence Committee at the insistence of Chairman DavidBoren, who had voted against my brother's nomination. Only ahandful of the media that had headlined the originalallegations even bothered to carry the story. The ombudsmanat the Washington Post told me, &quot;When you were accused, itwas news but it wasn't true; now that you're cleared, it'strue but it isn't news.&quot; Turn the page.   Clearly this is the scenario that Judge Thomas's opponentshave in mind -- and now they control the calendar. Had thevote on my brother's nomination occurred after the headlinesappeared virtually accusing me of treason, at least onewavering senator might have taken the guilt-by-associationbait and changed. And, since Dan's nomination was confirmedwith the presiding chairman (George Bush) voting to break atie, one change would have made all the difference, and ajudge who has been described by American Lawyer magazine as&quot;conscientious, serious, fair-minded, affable and eager tolearn,&quot; would have been kept off the bench.   With the leak of the Anita Hill affidavit, Judge Thomas'saccusers now have a clear shot at what was once a lost cause.Whether he might be cleared &quot;down the road,&quot; once the mudclears, is immaterial to his accusers. Moreover, theirchallenge to future nominees is clear. How many aspiringconservative jurists are out there now looking at JudgeThomas's sufferings and saying, with him, &quot;There but for thegrace of God go I&quot;? Since the substance of the allegationsagainst Judge Thomas is simply unprovable, it's strictly amatter of judgment. Will senators give to Clarence Thomas thesame benefit of the doubt they are willing to give to AlanCranston?   Whatever happens to the Thomas nomination, one urgent taskremains: The Senate Judiciary Committee must quickly ask theFBI to investigate the leak of the Anita Hill affidavit. Forobvious reasons, such a sensitive task cannot be assigned toanyone within the committee. In order to restore the public'sfaith in due process, the leaker -- member or staffer -- mustbe found, fired and punished.   Yes it's tough to have your whole life turned over to theFBI. But I've been there and it's not the Last Judgment.Clarence Thomas is there now. If Clarence Thomas can be askedto bear it, the committee members and staff should too.   ---   Mr. Manion, who teaches ethics at Boston University,served on the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committeefrom 1981 until 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
