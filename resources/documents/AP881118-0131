Mario Biaggi, a hero cop turnedrogue congressman, reasserted his innocence and sought mercy for hisson Friday before he was sentenced to eight years in prison forracketeering in the Wedtech corruption scandal.   ``I'm still of the belief, I always have been, that I aminnocent,'' the 10-term congressman told U.S. District JudgeConstance Baker Motley before she sentenced him to eight years inprison and fined him $242,000.   The judge said a prison term was necessary to assure thecommunity that ``the punishment for such crimes upon conviction willbe certain and substantial.''   Biaggi, 71, in a voice wracked by sobs, pleaded with the judge tospare his eldest son and co-defendant, Richard, from prison.   ``The worst possible punishment Your Honor could administer wouldbe to put my son in prison,'' said Biaggi, his eyes brimming withtears. ``I appeal to you as a father. ... Do what you want with me.My time is done. Don't hurt Richard.''   Richard Biaggi, 39, of Fort Lee, N.J., took off his glasses,buried his face in his hands and wept at the defense table duringhis father's plea.   Motley later sentenced the younger Biaggi to two years in prisonand fined him $71,000.   The elder Biaggi slumped in his chair but showed no emotion whileMotley sentenced him.   Prosecutors said afterward that the elder Biaggi would beeligible for parole after serving 40 months in prison.   Despite the emotional turmoil in the courtroom, the elder Biaggiwas seen in the hall during a break, chatting amiably with relativesand even chuckling occasionally.   ``I think he's upset at the sentence of his son more thananything else. I think he's upset at whether he himself can fulfill(his own) sentence _ physically fulfill the sentence,'' said Biaggilawyer James LaRossa.   Biaggi, a highly decorated city police officer from 1942 to 1965,was convicted Aug. 5 of all but one of the 16 counts against himincluding racketeering, extortion and mail fraud.   He was accused of turning Wedtech Corp., a defunct South Bronxdefense contractor, into a racketeering enterprise that paid outmillions of dollars in bribes to public officials for help inwinning no-bid contracts.   Richard Biaggi was acquitted of racketeering charges but wasfound guilty of bribe receiving, mail fraud and tax charges.   The elder Biaggi left the courtroom without comment after thenearly three-hour sentencing session. He was ordered to surrender toauthorities on Jan. 9.   He resigned from office a day after his conviction. He alreadyhas been sentenced to 2{ years in prison for obstruction and takingan illegal gratuity in an unrelated case.   The most notable recent convictions of members of Congress camefrom the Abscam investigation, which led to the conviction of Sen.Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey and six members of the house,including John M. Murphy of New York and Frank Thompson Jr. of NewJersey.   Biaggi, who could have been sentenced to a maximum total sentenceof 146 years in prison and $7 million in fines, was sentenced tobetween two and eight years on numerous counts which Motley orderedto run concurrently.   The judge said Biaggi's Wedtech sentence would run concurrentlywith the previous one.   ``But for the defendant's age and the state of his health, hisprison term would be substantially longer,'' Motley said.   Biaggi's lawyer noted before sentencing that his client suffersfrom heart problems that require daily medication as well as apronounced limp caused by a leg injury suffered in the line of dutyas a policeman.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward J. Little told Motley that thetrial evidence showed ``Biaggi is corrupt. Biaggi took bribes ...and sold out his office for nearly $1 million in fees and $2 millionin stocks.''   In a final plea before sentencing, Biaggi said the five-monthtrial and the month of ``devastating publicity'' before hisindictment were punishment enough.   ``There wasn't a day I didn't suffer,'' Biaggi said. ``I died alittle bit every day. I started to die some time ago.''   The judge received some 170 letters urging leniency andrecounting Biaggi's many contributions over the years, including 37from Republican and Democratic congressmen.   Three of the four other people convicted with the Biaggis lastAugust also were sentenced by Motley: former Bronx Borough PresidentStanley Simon, 58, five years and $70,000 in fines; Wedtech founderJohn Mariotta, 58, eight years, $291,000; and former Small BusinessAdministration official Peter Neglia, 40, three years and $30,000.   The sentencing of Biaggi's former law partner, Bernard Ehrlich,59, who also was convicted of racketeering, was postponed because hewas previously committed to a hospital after being found incompetentto stand trial in a state case. A seventh defendant was acquitted onall counts.</TEXT></DOC>
