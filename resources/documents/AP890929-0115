REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Support for Ferdinand Marcos hasdwindled steadily since he was ousted in a civilian-militaryuprising three years ago, and few believe his followers are strongenough to topple his successor, Corazon Aquino.   Still, President Aquino refuses to allow Marcos, who diedThursday in Hawaii, to be buried here because she said the funeralmight trigger ``destabilization efforts.''   Her adamant stand reflects a fear among senior officials thatMarcos' well-financed followers can create enough trouble todiscredit the government and frighten off foreign investors neededto help rebuild the country's debt-ridden economy.   In a country where public opinion surveys are notoriouslyunreliable, it is difficult to determine the extent of support forMarcos, who ruled this country for 20 years, longer than anyPhilippine president.   But the results of elections held since 1986 _ as well as theturnout in recent pro-Marcos rallies _ indicate a decline in thenumber of hardcore Marcos supporters.   After the February 1986 uprising that toppled Marcos, the latepresident's followers could muster up to 10,000 people for ralliesdemanding the return of the man they considered their legitimatepresident.   But in recent months, Marcos loyalists have been able to attractonly a few hundred participants. Many are middle-aged men and womenfrom Marcos' northern Luzon island stronghold.   None of the candidates clearly identified as Marcos supporterswon election to the Senate in the May 1987 congressional balloting.Nineteen avowed pro-Marcos politicians were elected to the200-member House of Representatives.   Unlike the 24 senators who were elected in nationwide balloting,House members were elected by district, indicating scatteredpockets of support for Marcos, particularly in northern Luzon andparts of Mindanao island.   Marcos supporters are organized into about 30 differentfactions, including the ``Ako'y Pilipino,'' or ``I am a Filipino''group, and the New Society Movement, the party Marcos organized.   One source with close ties to the Marcos movement, speaking oncondition of anonymity, estimated that up to a million of the 58million Filipinos were either members of pro-Marcos groups orsupported them.   That represents a sizeable political base, and alreadypoliticians are jockeying for control of the movement. Candidatesfor the Marcos mantel include Vice President Salvador Laurel, Sen.Juan Ponce Enrile and Eduardo Cojuangco, Mrs. Aquino's estrangedcousin who fled to California after Marcos was overthrown.   Division within the Marcos camp may be in part responsible forthe delay in organizing the protests that were widely anticipatedafter Marcos' death.   After Marcos' ouster, the peak of the loyalist movement was theJune 1986 takeover of the Manila Hotel. Troops loyal to Marcosseized the hotel and declared the former president's 1986 runningmate, Arturo Tolentino, as acting president.   The mutineers, who were receiving instructions by telephone fromMarcos, surrendered about 40 hours later. In January 1987,pro-Marcos troops seized a radio-television station and held outfor about 60 hours before surrendering.   Afterward, the government claimed Marcos was preparing to leaveHawaii secretly for Manila in case the coup attempt succeeded.   The base of Marcos' support is in the Ilocano-speaking areas ofthe north, which includes the late president's birthplace, Sarrat,and the family's ancestral home, Batac.   Other Marcos strongholds include scattered areas of the centralVisayas islands and Mindanao _ mostly in districts controlled bywarlords with whom the former president forged alliances.   But the deepest sympathy for Marcos is in the Ilocano regions ofthe north. Filipino culture requires special loyalty to members ofone's own linguistic group or province.   Ilocanos, a strongly clannish group, number about 6 million andare the third-largest linguistic group in a country where more than80 languages and dialects are spoken.   Ilocanos are strongly represented within the Philippinemilitary. Figures on their numbers are unavailable, but reporterscovering the August 1987 coup attempt, led by renegade Lt. Col.Gregorio Honasan, heard many of the mutineers speaking Ilocano.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Robert H.
