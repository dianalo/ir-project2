He was 92.   The Sao Paulo Heart Disease Emergency Center, where Volpi wastaken after feeling chest pains, said he died on Sunday and wasburied the same day.   Volpi, best known for his intricate geometrical forms in varyingtones of red, orange, green, blue and yellow, left behind about3,000 works of art that spanned a career of 70 years.   Art critic Olivio Tavares de Araujo, one of the country's topVolpi experts, said international fame eluded the artist becausemost of his works are in private Brazilian collections and notavailable for public exhibition.   Araujo said Volpi created his own artistic movement and could beconsidered ``in the same league as Picasso.'' The critic added:``There is no doubt in my mind that in terms of artistic importanceand of overall contribution to the world of art, Volpi is Brazil'sanswer to Picasso.''   Born in Lucca, Italy, in 1896, Volpi was two years old when hisparents immigrated to Sao Paulo, South America's largest city.   For years he earned a living and developed his artistic talentsby painting flowery decorations on the inner walls of houses in SaoPaulo.   Little by little he started painting on canvas _ firstrepresentational landscapes, seascapes, portraits and still lifes.Gradually he moved to abstract art exploring shapes, color andlight.   It wasn't until the 1960s that he started creating thegeometrical patterns that made him famous.</TEXT></DOC>
