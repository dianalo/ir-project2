The strike, which started Friday, was called by the BangladeshRoad Transport Workers Federation.   Federation leader Salahuddin Ahmed said about 30,000 buses,minibuses and three-wheeled motorscooter taxis stayed off thestreets. An unknown number of freight-hauling trucks also wereidled.   The strike was sparked by a bill introduced in Parliament twoweeks ago seeking a penalty of 25 years in jail for causing atraffic death. The current penalty is five years.   An average of two people are killed every day in trafficaccidents in Bangladesh, an impoverished nation where most peoplecannot afford their own cars and even bus fares are beyond themeans of many people.   Ahmed said the strikers also were protesting what he calledattempts by supporters of the governing Jatiya Party to extortmoney from transport workers.   The extortion allegation was denied by Abdul Khaleque, a Jatiyamember of Parliament who operates a trucking business. ``Thegovernment party has nothing to do with the hoodlums fighting overextortion money,'' he said.   On Friday, at least 30 people were injured in Dhaka duringclashes between rival transport workers, police said. Theantagonists used small, homemade bombs, guns and machetes.   The independent Azad newspaper said police arrested more than100 strikers for violence. Police refused to comment on the report.</TEXT></DOC>
