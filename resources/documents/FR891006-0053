The proposedaction is part of DOE's Clean Coal Technology Program, which is designedto evaluate emerging technologies to displace oil and natural gas or toutilize coal more cleanly, efficiently, and economically than currentlyavailable technology. The Energy and Environmental Research Corporation(EER) would conduct the demonstration project at Lakeside Station, Springfield,Illinois Unit No. 7, a 33 MWe cyclone-fired boiler.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>background: </T2>In December 1985, Congress made funds available fora Clean Coal Technology (CCT) Program in Public Law No. 99-190 ``for thepurpose of conducting cost-shared Clean Coal Technology projects for theconstruction and operation of facilities to demonstrate the feasibilityfor future commercial applications of such technology * * *,'' and authorizedDOE to conduct the CCT program. DOE issued a Program Opportunity Notice(PON) on February 17, 1986, to solicit proposals for conducting cost-sharedCCT demonstrations. The EER proposal for a gas reburning-sorbent injection(GR-SI) demonstration at Lakeside Station was one of nine selected by theDOE for negotiation. EER and DOE signed Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC22-87PC79796in June 1987. Co-funding for the project is being provided by the Gas ResearchInstitute (GRI) and the Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources(ENR).The combination of technologies to be demonstrated, gas reburning withsorbent injection, involves introduction of natural gas into the boilerabove the main heat release zone. In the upper part of the furnace whichis downstream of this zone, burnout air and calcium-based sorbent are injectedinto the gas stream. Gas reburning is effective in the reduction of NO<T2>x</T2> emissions to molecular nitrogen (N<T2>2</T2>). The sorbent injected into the flue gas stream reacts withgas phase SO<T2>2</T2>/SO<T2>3</T2> to form calcium sulfate. The calcium sulfate is subsequentlyremoved by the plant particulate control equipment.The Lakeside Station and the adjacent Daliman Station occupy a 75-acresite on the northwest shore of Lake Springfield, in the Southeast sectionof the city of Springfield in Sangamon County, Illinois.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>environmental impacts: </T2>Potential environmental consequences ofthe proposed action were analyzed for both construction activities andplant operation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Construction</ITAG>Minor fugitive dust emissions from an 0.1 acre area, where equipment installationand minor landscaping are planned, is expected. Transportation effectswould be negligible with an increase from the existing traffic of 120 to121 trucks per day at the site. Construction noise would be short-termand characteristic of an already heavily industrialized site. There area few residences near the plant. A 1400-foot natural gas pipeline wouldbe built entirely on-site and would temporarily disturb approximately anacre of existing roadway and grass-covered property.No increase in soil erosion is expected and there will be no adverse impactsto archaeological, cultural, or historical resources. Construction laborforce requirements of less than 20 personnel would be provided from anample local workforce.<ITAG tagnum="84">Operation</ITAG>Once operational, emission rates of NO<T2>x</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> are expected to decrease by 60 percent and 50 percent respectively.The particulate emission rate from Unit 7 is expected to remain unchangedbut total particulate emissions will increase slightly due to a 1 percenthigher capacity factor. Fugitive dust emissions from transportation andstorage of sorbents will be controlled by a dustless, pneumatic handlingsystem and fully enclosed tanker trucks. Coal pile runoff will be unchangedand there will be a small reduction in plant water use. The amount of bottomash will be less and continue to be disposed in the ash pond, but the amountof GR-SI fly ash will increase so that there will be an increase in solidwaste disposal. The fly ash wastes will be transported to a landfill permittedby the Illinois EPA to accept this waste type. The proposed action willnot impact any federally-listed threatened or endangered species and noecologically sensitive areas will be disrupted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>alternatives considered: </T2>An overall strategy for compliance withthe National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was developed for the CCTProgram consistent with the Council on Environmental Quality NEPA regulations(40 CFR parts 1500-1508) and the DOE guidelines for compliance with NEPA(52 FR 47662, December 15, 1987). This strategy includes both programmaticand project-specific environmental impact considerations, during and subsequentto the selection process.This strategy has three major elements. The first involves preparationof a comparative programmatic environmental impact analysis, based on informationprovided by the offerors and supplemented by DOE, as necessary. This environmentalanalysis ensures that relevant environmental consequences of the CCT Programand reasonable programmatic alternatives are evaluated in the selectionprocess.The second element involves preparation of a pre-selection project-specificenvironmental review based on project-specific environmental data and analysesthat offerors supplied as a part of their proposals. This analysis containeda discussion of the site-specific environmental, health, safety, and socioeconomicsissues associated with the demonstration project. It included, to the maximumextent possible, a discussion of alternative sites and/or processes reasonablyavailable to the offeror, a discussion of the environmental impacts ofthe proposed project and practical mitigating measures, and a list of permits,to the extent known, that must be obtained to implement the proposal. Italso contained the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal relative tothe demonstration project environmental and site-related criterion. Thethird element provides for preparation by DOE of site-specific documentsfor each project selected for financial assistance under the PON.In the EA, DOE considered the following alternatives to the proposed actionof a demonstration project involving co-firing pulverized coal with naturalgas in combination with sorbent-injection and/or coal cleaning at CWLPLakeside Station, Boiler No. 7: No action, alternative technologies, andalternative sites.Under the no action alternative, the GR-SI technologies would not be installedat Lakeside Station. Environmental conditions would remain the same andthe beneficial NO<T2>x</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> reductions would not be realized. DOE would be unable to evaluateGR-SI technology on a full-scale utility boiler and the goals of the CleanCoal Technology Program would not be advanced.Likewise, installation of alternative emission control technologies wouldnot provide DOE with information on the effectiveness of GR-SI. In particular,information would be lacking on the effect of GR-SI with a cyclone-firedboiler. Installing alternative technologies is not a practical option.Two alternative sites, Edwards and Hennepin Stations, are considered bythe applicant (EER) to be suitable for installation of GR-SI technologies.The environmental impacts of installing the GR-SI process at these alternativesites are evaluated in independent NEPA compliance actions. The units suitablefor retrofit at these stations are front-wall-fired and tangentially-fired,respectively, and would not demonstrate the GR-SI technology, in a cyclone-firedunit.Although Lakeside Station, Hennepin Station, and Edwards Station are locatednear the Illinois River, they are at a substantial distance from one another;therefore, cumulative impacts from development at two or even three locationsis not expected.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FLOODPLAIN STATEMENT OF FINDINGS</T2>: The GR-SI project will be conductedin Unit 7 of Lakeside Station. Coal combustion and flue gas cleaning wastesare currently transported to an on-site waste disposal area which is withinthe 100-year floodplain. During the GR-SI project the bottom ash will continueto be sluiced to the ash pond but the amount of ash will be slightly less.However, the GR-SI fly ash will not be disposed in the ash pond, but willbe disposed of in a permitted off-site landfill. A Floodplain/WetlandsInvolvement Notice for the project was published in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>Volume 54, Number 45, Thursday, March 9, 1989.No comments were received in reply to the notice. On the basis of the floodplainassessment in the Environmental Assessment (EA-0381), Appendix A, DOE hasdetermined that there will be only a beneficial impact to the floodplaindue to the decreased amount of waste that will be disposed of in the ashpond. All actions will be in conformity with local floodplain protectionstandards and the requirements of the Illinois Department of Transportationand the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pertaining to floodplains.<ITAG tagnum="84">Determination</ITAG>The proposed action, a demonstration project involving co-firing pulverizedcoal with natural gas in combination with sorbent-injection and/or coalcleaning at CWLP Lakeside Station, Boiler No. 7, does not constitute amajor Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentwithin the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act. This findingis based on the analysis in the EA. Therefore, an Environmental ImpactStatement for the proposed action is not required.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on September 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Raymond P.
