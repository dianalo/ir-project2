Janos Berecz, chief ideologist of the Hungarian SocialistWorkers' (communist) Party, said in a report to the policy-settingCentral Committee that a law regulating parties should be passedbefore a new constitution is adopted in early 1990.   ``The party ... advocates society's right to self-organization,and therefore it supports the enactment of a party law that willregulate the foundation of parties in keeping with the newconstitution,'' Berecz said in his speech, published by the officialnews agency MTI.   It was the party's first direct support of a multi-party system.In November the government approved for presentation to Parliamentdraft bills to permit such a system.   Berecz did not say what kind of power new parties will bepermitted to wield. MTI has said the leading role of the HungarianSocialist Workers' Party will remain at least until the newconstitution is adopted.   The keynote address by Berecz comes a week before Parliament isto pass a law on assembly and association that sparked a nationwidedebate in Hungary on the feasibility of a multi-party system.   However, Berecz rejected a multi-party system along a Westerndemocratic model.   ``We disagree with the bourgeois (Western) interpretation of themulti-party system,'' he said.   Communists have also said they do not want to see the developmentof parties like those in Czechoslovakia or East Germany, which carrylittle or no political weight. They say parties that develop shouldbe capable of bearing responsibility.   The country's leaders have said the law would mean the acceptancein principle of a multi-party system but have emphasized that aseparate law would be needed to regulate the establishment andfunction of independent political parties.   Berecz said the draft constitution could be put before theCentral Committee as early as May or June 1989 and then presented toParliament in the spring of 1990 following public debate on thedraft.   He also advocated a plebiscite on the new constitution asdemanded by independent groups and some lawmakers after it isapproved by Parliament.   Elections could then be held in the second half of 1990, Bereczwas quoted as saying.   In an interview with the independent Reform weekly, publishedThursday, Central Committee Secretary Matyas Szueros indicatedindependent parties could begin to function on a local level asearly as 1989.   Dozens of independent organizations have mushroomed in the pastyear, many with highly political platforms and nationwide support.</TEXT></DOC>
