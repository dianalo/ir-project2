VH-1's parent MTV Networks, which also has the big-time MTV andNickelodeon cable channels, has in recent months boosted VH-1'sstaff and budget and given VH-1 chief Jeff Rowe his own pipeline tonetwork president and chief executive officer Tom Freston.   The developments at VH-1 are what network television has most tofear about cable: an entire broadcast agenda microprogrammed to onevery lucrative audience.   While the networks take snatches of the age 25 to 49 audiencewith shows like ``thirtysomething,'' ``China Beach,'' ``The WonderYears,'' and ``L.A. Law,'' they also have to reach viewers who wereunconscious from 1960 to 1980. Just watch ``Nightingales.''   VH-1, its parent MTVN hopes, is for everyone who stayed awakeduring those years.   ``We feel this is a great chance to target the audience thatgrew up on television and contemporary music,'' Rowe said in arecent interview.   The new VH-1 programming includes interview segments, clips ofclassic and contemporary rock and pop, ``infotainment'' reportingon show business, and special attention to weekends, when VH-1watchers are more apt to set aside their graph charts and tune in.   The theme weekends have included interviews, clips and concertfilms devoted to Elton John, Paul Simon, Tina Turner and others.   Rowe also acknowledged the challenge of reaching an audiencethat includes Vietnam veterans, former peace marchers, sociologistswho became investment bankers and business majors who operatehalfway houses.   ``A network that is targeted to fit this generation has to knowhow it lives,'' he said ``We want to create an environment thatkeeps people up on contemporary music, but also reflects theirpast; has comedy about current events, but also is nostalgic.''   To keep both ends of the candle burning, VH-1 is sponsoring a``Million Dollar Baby'' contest for the offspring of baby boomersand offers a series of Earth Alerts _ celebrity-hostedinformational spots keyed to the activities of the Greenpeaceorganization.   The ``Million Dollar Baby,'' sponsored by Gerber Products Co.and Downy fabric softener, harkens back to the corporate-sponsoredcontests of the 1950s. Entrants send in a photo of their offspringfrom ages four months to 2{ years, with an April 24 deadlinelooming. The winner will be announced May 8.   The prize is a zero coupon municipal bond, worth $1 million atmaturity.   The Earth Alerts are tied in with a celebrity fund-raiser album,``Rainbow Warrior,'' due this month on Geffen Records.``Environmental issues are still the issues of this generation,''said VH-1 spokeswoman Dana Kornbluth.   ``At the farthest end, there is not much we can do to shock thisaudience,'' said Rowe. ``This audience did a lot of crazy thingsback in the 1960s and 1970s ... we can't take ourselves tooseriously.''   One of VH1's best efforts to catch the spin of its viewersrecently failed with the cancellation of the ``Watch Bobby Rivers''interview show. Rivers remains with the network as a host, and heis typical of the exuberant, insightful personality VH-1 is seekingfor its audience.   The 35-year-old Rivers grew up in the Willowbrook neighborhoodof Los Angeles and graduated from Verbum Dei High School _ where hewas president of the library club _ and Marquette University. He'sa bookish, energetic personality who came to VH-1 from WPIX-TV inNew York and before that was an interviewer for the syndicated ``PMMagazine.''   His first exposure to the power of television was the WattsRiots in August of 1965, just a few blocks from his home.   ``We were all in the living room watching the riot on TV, and itlooked like all of Los Angeles was going up,'' Rivers said. ``Butno, it really was just a very small community. But from what was onTV, people in Redondo Beach (a Los Angeles suburb) were ready topack up and leave town.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   BACK IN THE SADDLE ...
