Karicher, (202) 632-5056.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In a report that accompanied Pub. L.100-71, Congress recommended that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)``* * * examine the possibility of proposing changes in the underlyingstatute to address * * * anomalies in the statutory wage and survey process[for Federal prevailing rate (wage) employees] and report to the Committee* * *.''Based on the philosophy that wages in a prevailing rate system should followthe local economy, regardless of which direction the economy moves, OPMhas considered the use of pay retention as inappropriate when a wage scheduleis reduced as a result of a decline in the local private sector economy.However, in recent years we have noticed that wage schedule reductionsgenerally are short-lived, usually affect the lowest-paid wage employees,and have little impact on Federal spending. Further, over the past severalyears pay increases have been capped, and Federal wage rates have not alwayskept pace with prevailing rates in the local economy. OPM now believes that pay retention would be appropriate in reducing theimpact of survey anomalies. In addition, we believe there is sufficientflexibility in the existing statute governing grade and pay retention (5U.S.C. 5365) to allow OPM adequately to protect wages when schedules arereduced by revising andSection; 536.104(a)(3)(ii) of Title 5, Code of FederalRegulations. This revision will remove the restriction on granting payretention to a wage employee whose rate of basic pay is reduced as theresult of the findings of a wage survey. <ITAG tagnum="84">Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </ITAG>Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of title 5, United States Code, I findthat good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemakingand for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. The noticeis being waived and the regulation is being made effective immediatelyin the event a prevailing rate is reduced as the result of a wage surveyin the near future. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it will affect only Federalemployees and agencies. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 536</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Wages. <ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director. </ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending Part 536 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations,as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 536_GRADE AND PAY RETENTION </ITAG>1.
