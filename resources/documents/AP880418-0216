Bush told the Toledo Rotary Club that the U.S. strike on Iranianoil platforms was ``a measured military action to make sure theIranians have no illusions. ... They've got to know we're going toprotect our ships, and if they threaten us we'll respond.''   Asked if the United States were, in effect, in a state ofundeclared war with Iran, the vice president said: ``No, we'renot.''   Bush aides said he was briefed Sunday on the planned militaryoperation and also met with President Reagan and congressionalleaders at the White House in the evening.   ``We didn't see any reason to cancel this trip,'' Bush chief ofstaff Craig Fuller said.   The vice president, all but assured of being the Republicanpresidential nominee in the fall, was campaigning one day beforethe New York primary. The Pennsylvania primary is a week later;Ohio's is a week after that.   Asked by reporters about the developments after he addressed agroup of Toledo business leaders, Bush said, ``Our peopleunderstand it is appropriate to have a proper response when ourobligation is protection of sea lanes. We took an appropriateresponse. Iran decided to escalate.''   In an interview with local reporters, Bush said the U.S. actionwas ``proportional and rather swift.''   ``We're not going to back down, nor will the allies with us inthe Gulf,'' Bush said. ``We cannot be pressured out of ourresponsibilities by madmen like (Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi or,in today's news, (Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini.''   Bush defended his decision to campaign instead of remaining inWashington to monitor Persian Gulf developments. Aides said hewould interrupt a Tuesday campaign swing through Pennsylvania toattend a midday National Security Council meeting in Washington.   Even though he has a lock on the GOP nomination, with formertelevision evangelist Pat Robertson offering only token opposition,Bush has been campaigning anyway _ mostly in populous states whichare important in the general election.   In Cleveland, Bush toured the Cleveland Clinic and was briefedon research into artificial hearts.   He also spoke at a Lithuanian meeting hall, sharing the stagewith Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, a Republican who is seekingto unseat Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.   But the events in the Persian Gulf dominated Bush's day as herepeatedly sought to characterize the U.S. action as provoked.   ``I was glad we were standing up to a radical muslim in thePersian Gulf today,'' he said at the Lithuanian hall in Cleveland.He added that he was proud to serve with a president who knew that``sometimes the United States and only the United States can standfor freedom.''   ``We don't seek a confrontation with Iran but we're going tomeet our obligations and live up to our commitments. And we hopethe Iranians draw the proper and appropriate conclusion,'' he toldthe Toledo Rotary Club.   Iran must be prepared to ``pay a price'' for its aggression, hesaid. He accused Iran of ``irresponsible behavior'' in resumingmine-laying operations.   ``The alternative (to striking back) is unthinkable for the freeworld _ to sit and do nothing,'' Bush said.</TEXT></DOC>
