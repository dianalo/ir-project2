Today's Guard manpower is at a record level, almost at fullstrength, with 460,000 in 2,043 units in the Army National Guard,and 115,000 in 642 Air National Guard units. That's about 100,000more than even during the Vietnam War when many young men joinedthe Guard to avoid the draft.   The fact that Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, the Republican vicepresidential nominee, served in the Guard during that period drewsome political fire, including allegations _ which he denied _ thathis way into the Guard was eased by family influence.   Today's young men and women, who were only children when theVietnam War was going on, are joining the Guard for a number ofreasons, including an apparent resurgence of patriotism, theadventure of travel to foreign countries and to fatten theirwallets.   Under the 1987 Montgomery GI Bill, Guardsmen are now eligiblefor free college tuition after they sign up for eight years andcomplete their initial six months of basic training. They can getup to $140 a month for up to 36 months full-time education. Theyalso get year-round commissary privileges, not just for the periodsthey are in training. A private makes $89.52 for one weekend, forexample, and a staff sergeant gets $194.37.   A National Guardsman must train a minimum of 39 days a year,including an annual 15-day period and one weekend a month. And withtoday's global exercises many volunteer for extra duty. On average,Guard officials say, enlisted personnel train about 49 days a yearand officers 79 days a year.   ``We are doing exciting things that we did not do before,'' saysMaj. Gen. Robert C. Thrasher, adjutant general of California, whose26-year-old son joined the Guard and a college ROTC program, partlybecause of the free tuition payments.   ``Also, I think patriotism is returning to a degree. To my son,Vietnam is kind of a shadow in the past, something that happened inhistory.''   President Lyndon Johnson decided against large-scalemobilization of the Guard for Vietnam. Of the 3.4 million sent toSoutheast Asia in that war, only 22,745 were guardsmen. Johnsonfeared it would lead to more public pressure to ``bring the boyshome'' if entire hometown units were sent to war.   Johnson's decision didn't make a lot of Guard officers happy.   ``I think it was a very stupid decision on his part,'' says Maj.Gen. Francis R. Gerard, New Jersey's blunt-spoken adjutant general,the last of the World War II ace fighter pilots still on activeduty. ``That's what we're in the business for.''   Once derided as ``weekend warriors'' and armed with sometimesdefective hand-me-down weapons, today's guardsman frequently trainsalongside his regular Army counterpart with top-of-the-lineweaponry such as the Abrams M-1 tank, the M-2 Bradley FightingVehicle and the Roland Air Defense Missile.   The Air National Guard, which provides most of the air defenseof the United States, with two fighter-interceptors on 24-houralert at each of 22 locations, also has benefited from the militarybuildup of the Reagan years.   ``Today the Air Guard is in basically the very same first-lineequipment that the active Air Force is in _ F15s, F16s, brand newC-130s,'' says Maj. Gen. John B. Conaway, director of the AirNational Guard.   Like the Army Guard, the Air Guard is a full partner in theTotal Force, participating in global exercies. Air Guard fightersare frequently scrambled to intercept Soviet ``Bear'' bombersapproaching U.S. air space. Air Guard tankers provided air-to-airrefueling during the strikes at Grenada and Libya.   While the Guard is better equipped than it ever has been, thereare still some shortages.   ``We need more of it, just as the active forces do, and much ofthe Vietnam-era equipment is beginning to age,'' says Dan Donahue,spokesman for the National Guard Bureau. ``But, yes, we getfirst-line equipment, right off the assembly line.''   Not long off the assembly line was a $5 million Q36 radardirecting the Gator Brigade's artillery fire at this 65,000-acreNational Guard training base in a sparsely populated area ofnorth-central Florida. The high-tech machine was in the care ofChief Warrant Officer George Howard of Plant City, an IBMtechnician in civilian life, a Korean veteran who joined the Guardat age 16. He's seen first-hand the transformation of the Guardover the years.   ``Brother, there's no comparison,'' he says. ``The training isso much more intense. We used to meet once a week and drink beerand play cards. Now we hit the ground running.''   How do the regulars, the professionals, the West Pointers, reactto this ``partnership'' with part-time soldiers?   Gen. John R. Galvin, who started out as a private in theMassachusetts National Guard and is now commander of the U.S. andNATO forces in Europe, had this to say after observing a NationalGuard unit at the Certain Challenge exercise in West Germany inlate September:   ``I really have come to appreciate the Guard and the Reserve,''he said. ``I'm really high on them after what I have seen out here.The reserve components are bigger in size than the activecomponents, so they are absolutely of the first importance to us.''   But many regular Army officers grumble off the record thatguardsmen are after all only part-time soldiers and they are notready to accept them as equals.   A senior Guard official, who didn't want to be identified byname, put it this way:   ``It's like being black and living down South. They may not likeus, but there are a lot of us and we've got a lot of votes.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
