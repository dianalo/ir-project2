Therewas ample gross and histopathologic evidence that the particles investigatedare both deposited and retained in pulmonary alveolar tissues. Lung pathologyin rats and monkeys demonstrated focal deposition of particles in thelungs of each exposed animal and alveolar type II cell hyperplasia andlipoidosis in rats. The latter was more evident in rats exposed to dieselexhaust. There was, however, no strong evidence of emphysema, bronchitisor fibrogenic changes. Both of the particles affected the defense mechanismsof the lung against infectious diseases without altering the membraneintegrity of alveolar macrophages. Exposure to coal dust activated phagocytosisby alveolar macrophages, whereas diesel exhaust depressed phagocytosis.Specifically, exposure to coal dust increased the number of macrophagesobtained by lavage, enhanced the secretion of reactive forms of oxygen,and increased cellular surface area. In contrast, exposure to dieselexhaust resulted in decreased secretion of reactive forms of oxygen anddiminished surface ruffling. The combination of coal dust and dieselexhaust resulted in degrees of secretory activity and surface morphologyintermediate between the effects of separate exposures.</TEXT></DOC>
