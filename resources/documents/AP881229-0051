LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former government ministers werearrested today on corruption charges stemming from an investigationinto widespread abuses under former President Chun Doo-hwan,officials said.   Government prosecutors said Kim Chong-ho, the former constructionminister, was arrested on charges of taking bribes from constructioncompanies in the massive urban redevelopment projects in centralSeoul.   Also arrested was Cha Kyu-hun, who once served as transportationminister under Chun. Cha was charged with taking bribes frombusinessmen for helping them obtain permits to build and operategolf courses.   Prosecutors are investigating allegations of widespreadcorruption under Chun, including extortion of money from businesses,diversion of government funds, influence peddling and forcedpolitical donations. The National Assembly is investigatingcorruption and human rights abuses under Chun.   Some of Chun's relatives and associates have been arrested orconvicted of corruption, but it was the first arrest of former Chunministers. The former ministers are also ex-generals.   There have been allegations the former president collectedillicit political donations through the licensing of golf courses.Licenses to build golf courses are highly profitable and muchsought-after.   Chun has denied any personal corruption, but has admitted hemanaged political donations.   A former general who took power with military backing in 1980,Chun went into voluntary rural exile last month after apologizing tothe nation for abuses under his seven-year rule, which ended inFebruary.   President Roh Tae-woo, a former general and once close ally ofChun, has asked the nation to forgive his disgraced predecessor. Rohopposes punishing Chun, but the opposition demands the formerpresident appear before the National Assembly's probe into hisgovernment.   Opposition parties say they will not agree to consider a pardonfor Chun until he appears before National Assembly. Roh says Chunmust be forgiven to promote national unity.   Some opposition leaders hope nationwide furor over Chun andrevelations of abuses under his rule will hurt Roh's chances ofwinning a referendum sometime next year on his rule.   Roh promised to hold the referendum after the Seoul Olympics,which ended in October. The government is identified with Chun inthe eyes of some South Koreans and Roh, who was elected a year agowhen two candidates split the opposition vote, faces a majorchallenge in winning the referendum.   The government has not said what Roh will do if he loses thereferendum. Roh would not be obliged to resign, but a defeat wouldsignal a lack of public confidence and the government would be underpressure to call elections.   No date has been set for the referendum, which is expected in thespring.</TEXT></DOC>
