Bush made his declaration after White House press secretaryMarlin Fitzwater complained there are ``a lot of people who aretrying to portray this as another Vietnam situation or the beginningof massive troop buildup and so forth.''   At the Capitol, meanwhile, Senate Appropriations CommitteeChairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he will introduce legislationincreasing next year's anti-drug spending by $3.9 billion, payingfor it by cutting domestic and defense programs across the board by0.575 percent.   Byrd said his provision, to be proposed Tuesday, would bringtotal federal spending on drug programs to $10.1 billion in fiscal1990, which begins Oct. 1, $2.2 billion more than Bush has proposed.   ``The president says, `Read my lips,''' said Byrd, whose paneloversees about half of all federal spending. ``He says he won'tsupport any increase in taxes. So I have to do what I can do.''   Bush has proposed paying for the increases he proposed last weekby trimming spending for several programs, not across the board.   As for U.S. troops in the drug fight, about 30 servicemen havearrived in Colombia to help train that nation's military forces inusing newly supplied U.S. military equipment. Bush said Colombia hasreceived 10 aircraft, five helicopters and an assortment of jeeps,ambulances and armor.   The advisers and equipment are part of a $65 million package thatBush authorized last month for Colombia. The president announcedlast Tuesday that an additional $261 million in security aid will goto Colombia, Peru and Bolivia as the part of a five-year, $2 billionprogram.   While Bush tried to play down the role of U.S. forces in LatinAmerica, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee said themilitary will provide protection to U.S. drug enforcement agents andother law enforcement officials operating in such nations asColombia, Bolivia and Peru.   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said a secret directive signedrecently by Bush authorizes the military ``to be physically involvedwith units in the field where we have been invited to have our lawenforcement people.''   The senator said such protection is designed to prevent incidentssimilar to the torture and murder of U.S. drug agent EnriqueCamarena, in Guadalajara, Mexico, in February 1985. ``We can'tafford another Camarena,'' said DeConcini.   Fitzwater said he could not comment on the senator's remarksalthough the spokesman confirmed that Bush had signed a secretdirective outlining the goals and limits of military involvement inthe drug fight.   Fitzwater said the U.S. forces in Latin America do have the rightto defend themselves. He said that is standard policy for U.S.troops anywhere in the world.   ``They are there. There is a risk. Colombia is a very dangerousplace to be these days,'' Fitzwater said.   In another development, Fitzwater threw cold water on asuggestion by drug enforcement administrator John Lawn that theadministration is reconsidering whether to ban the sale of assaultweapons produced in the United States. The Bush administration hascurtailed importation of such weapons but has not taken any actionagainst those made in this country.   ``We aren't aware of any reconsideration,'' Fitzwater said. ``Bythat I mean there's none in the White House. ... I know the WhiteHouse position has been given to me by the highest authorities.   The president, in a speech to Treasury Department officials, usedvirtually the same language employed by Fitzwater in talking aboutthe role of U.S. servicemen.   ``Let me state clearly,'' Bush said, ``none of the Andean nationshave asked for U.S. troops. And there is no contemplation of the useof American armed forces in any combat role.   ``No U.S. military personnel will accompany host-governmentforces on actual field operations, the president added. ``Ourpersonnel will provide training, equipment and operational supportas we have been asked to do, and I will see that it works justexactly that day.''   Fitzwater refused to give details of the secret directive on thedrug war.   Asked if the directive left the door open for the use of troopsunder some conditions, Fitzwater said, ``I really can't go beyondthat it doesn't contemplate the use of troops. I think theinterpretation can fairly be made that it doesn't authorize troops,either.   During the day, Bush met with Britain's new foreign minister,John Major. Afterward, Major told reporters that Britain has had ateam of experts in Bogota for the past few days to assess how Londoncan help the government of President Virgilio Barco fight drugs.   Major said British officials have developed a package of trainingand technical assistance. ``It'll certainly also deal withprotection of personnel,'' he said.   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher saidthat a multi-country drug interdiction program called OperationSnowcap resumed over the weekend in Peru.   Operations had been suspended since February because of securityconcerns, but are resuming with the completion of a secure base inSanta Lucia, he said.   ``We have approximately 45 logistics personnel. I think these arecontractors basically. They maintain the equipment which supportsthe Snowcap operations as well as about 14 U.S. enforcementpersonnel advising Peruvian police in the Upper Huallaga Valley.''</TEXT></DOC>
