In a civil suit filed in U.S. District Court here Friday,Thomas F. Dooley, a former sales representative for UnitedTechnologies' Sikorsky helicopter division, asserts thatSaudi Arabia's ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar binSultan, was a key player in the deal, pressuring Pentagonofficials to override objections from a lower-levelDepartment of Defense export specialist who suspected abribe.</LP><TEXT>   The suit, in which Mr. Dooley asserts he was demoted forreporting the bribes to his superiors, says the bribes werepaid to two of Prince Bandar's brothers, Prince Khalid andPrince Fahad, through a Saudi middleman. The helicopters werepurchased by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Defense and Aviation,which is run by Prince Sultan, Prince Bandar's father.   None of the Saudi officials are named as defendants in thesuit. Mr. Dooley is seeking over $100 million in damages fromUnited Technologies, its subsidiaries and consultants, andfrom Westland Group PLC, a British company that is partiallyowned by United Technologies and is licensed to produceSikorsky Blackhawk helicopters. &quot;By virtue of the bribes,&quot;the suit alleges, United Technologies was able in 1987 tosell the Saudis 13 American-made Blackhawks; a deal for 90more Blackhawks made by Westland in Britain is pending.   Asked about the suit, Prince Bandar says, &quot;I am not awareof any payoffs, nor am I aware of pressuring anybody to doanything illegal.&quot; While the prince acknowledges discussingthe Blackhawks with high-level Pentagon officials, includingformer Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, he insists hewas simply relaying instructions from Riyadh. &quot;If it was notlegal, the Saudi Ministry of Defense would not have approvedit,&quot; he says.   The allegations in the suit could add to the alreadyconsiderable legal problems of United Technologies, based inHartford, Conn. As part of the &quot;Operation Ill Wind&quot; probeinto Pentagon procurement, the Justice Department iscurrently investigating allegations that the company'schairman, Robert Daniell, may have used inside information tohelp the company's Pratt andamp; Whitney subsidiary win ajet-engine contract from the Navy. Norden Systems Inc.,another United Technologies subsidiary, is also beinginvestigated under Ill Wind.   Martin Moore, a spokesman for United Technologies, saysthat after the bribery charge was raised by Mr. Dooley, thecompany asked Covington andamp; Burling, a major Washington lawfirm, to investigate the matter. &quot;That investigation extendedover several months and resulted in the conclusion that Mr.Dooley's claim was without merit,&quot; says Mr. Moore.   Mr. Moore adds that the company last month turned theresults of its internal investigation over to the JusticeDepartment, and &quot;we've offered to cooperate.&quot; He says theinvestigation showed that the sale was &quot;not in any waytainted by bribery,&quot; and that Mr. Dooley's demotion was notconnected with his attempts to alert company officials abouthis suspicions concerning the Blackhawk sale.   The 154-page lawsuit asserts a violation of the U.S.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and seeks punitive damagesunder the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.It lays out the anatomy of a sprawling arms deal in which,the suit asserts, the bribe was maneuvered through thePentagon's Foreign Military Sales program in the form of a$40 million maintenance contract for the 13 U.S.-madeBlackhawks.   That Pentagon program is designed to prevent bribes andpadding of contracts by using U.S. military expertise and byopening foreign sales to competition. But the Blackhawkmaintenance deal went to a Sikorsky affiliate as anon-competitive &quot;sole source&quot; award. According to the suit,Charles Trendley, then a contracting officer at the Army'sAviation Systems Command, suspected a bribe and threatened toreport it to the Justice Department.   According to the suit, Mr. Trendley was backed up bythen-Defense Secretary Weinberger, who wrote Prince Sultan inDecember 1987 to tell him the Pentagon opposed givingSikorsky the maintenance contract without competitivebidding. But the Pentagon later reversed its decision and thesole-source contract went to Sikorsky in August 1988 --&quot;through the influence of Prince Bandar in Washington, D.C.,&quot;the suit alleges.   Prince Bandar allegedly contacted Mr. Trendley's superiorsto make sure that the Sikorsky affiliate and its partner, aSaudi company called Thimar Aviation Supply Co., werecertified to do the helicopter maintenance.   A spokeswoman for Mr. Weinberger, now publisher of Forbesmagazine, said he was &quot;out of the country and unreachable.&quot;Daniel J. O'Boyle, a spokesman for the Army Aviation SystemsCommand, said that neither Mr. Trendley, who has since beentransferred to another job, nor Maj. Gen. Donald Williamson,who heads the command, were available for comment.   The suit states that a network of former U.S. Armyofficers, many of whom had served as military attaches inSaudi Arabia, were involved in the Blackhawk deal. Accordingto Mr. Dooley's attorney, Michael Madigan, of the Washingtonfirm of Akin, Gump, Hauer andamp; Feld, Mr. Dooley is a 1964 WestPoint graduate who served two tours in Vietnam and wasawarded the Silver Star.   A helicopter expert, Mr. Dooley was a lieutenant colonelserving as a military attache in Riyadh in 1984 when he wasoffered a job by Sikorsky as a marketing coordinator in theMiddle East. Accepting the job, he was assigned to theBlackhawk sales effort in Saudi Arabia, which was spearheadedby a retired U.S. Army brigadier general, Olin E. Smith.   Mr. Smith was a military attache in Saudi Arabia in themid-1960s when he became friends with Prince Bandar, then aSaudi Air Force pilot. Since retiring from the Army, Mr.Smith has represented United Technologies and several othermajor U.S. defense contractors as an outside sales consultantin Saudi Arabia.   In the suit, Mr. Dooley alleges that Mr. Smith told himnot to tell the U.S. government that Sikorsky was preparing ajoint venture with a Saudi businessman, Ibrahim A. al-Namlah.At the time, Mr. Dooley asserts, he didn't know that theSaudi businessman had set up Thimar Aviation to allegedly&quot;funnel bribes&quot; to the Saudi princes.   In April 1987, Mr. Dooley alleges, Mr. Smith told him thatSikorsky &quot;could do no wrong&quot; and that he should &quot;go throughBandar for everything.&quot; Reached in his Columbia, S.C.,office, Mr. Smith said, &quot;I don't have any comment.&quot; Mr.al-Namlah could not be reached for comment.   Two months later, Mr. Dooley states, he was told about thebribes by Mr. al-Namlah, who began pressuring Sikorsky for a&quot;bonus&quot; of 3% to 5% from a $130 million portion of thehelicopter deal. The bonus, allegedly, was being claimed bythe two princes. Sikorsky officials, Mr. Dooley asserts, thentold him they already knew about the involvement of the Saudiprinces and that Mr. Dooley should leave the matter for themand Mr. Smith to resolve.   Although he says he was told by Sikorsky officials that heshould &quot;learn to work in the dark&quot; about such matters, Mr.Dooley continued to voice his concerns until Oct. 6, 1988.That day, he asserts, a company security guard stopped himand confiscated his personal papers, and he was locked out ofhis offices in Connecticut and Riyadh.   Later, he charges, his salary was reduced by $100,000 andhe was removed from the Saudi program and reassigned toSikorsky's Stratford, Conn., headquarters, where he iscurrently a &quot;senior logistics analyst.&quot;   Mr. Dooley alleges that Mr. Smith then told him thatbecause of a computer malfunction, Mr. Smith had lost fiveyears worth of records about the Saudi Blackhawk deal.According to Mr. Dooley, Mr. Smith advised him to write anote to Sikorsky's president admitting that he, Mr. Dooley,had &quot;made errors&quot; in handling the Saudi deal. Mr. Dooleyrefused.   It isn't yet known whether the Justice Department, whichreceived the results of United Technologies' internal probelast month, is opening its own investigation into the allegedbribes. Other allegations raised in the suit may attractinterest from other parts of the government, especially thePentagon and Congress.   One issue involves the arming of the U.S.-made Blackhawks.The Saudis wanted the craft to be armed, but there wereconcerns that Congress might reject the sale of armedhelicopters to them. Instead, Mr. Dooley alleges, the wiringof the 13 Blackhawks was secretly changed so that they couldlater be equipped with machine guns and wire-guided antitankmissiles by Westland in Britain. He says he was told by Mr.Smith that &quot;under no circumstances should the arminginformation get into U.S. Army channels.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
