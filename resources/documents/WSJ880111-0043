But a weak dollar and signs of renewed vigor in the economy suggest the Federal Reserve hasn't been stingy in supplying credit to the financial system, many economists say.    During the past 12 months, various yardsticks of money have shown little or no gain. As of Dec. 30, the amount of reserves the Fed supplied the banking system stood at $57.2 billion, about the same as the previous year-end figure. M1, the basic monetary aggregate measuring cash and checking accounts, increased only 1.3%, its lowest year-to-year growth since 1961. Similarly, M3, which includes M1, savings accounts, certificates of deposit and other loan instruments, registered its lowest growth in at least 20 years.    &quot;It all points to a weak economy and a possible recession,&quot; says Edward S. Hyman, vice chairman of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. &quot;It's the No. 1 topic among money managers.&quot;    Though baffled by the sluggish money growth, many economists say the figures aren't as significant in determining a slump as they were just a few years ago. For instance, the latest Labor Department report showed that unemployment fell to 5.8% of the civilian work force last month from 5.9% in November, the lowest since mid-1979, while non-farm payrolls increased 326,000.    The report rekindled investor fears of inflation in the bond market Friday and triggered a major sell-off. A sudden rise in long-term interest rates helped spark a 140.58-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Commodity prices have surged to their highest levels in more than a year while the dollar's sharp decline since 1985 has sparked a boom for U.S. exporters.    &quot;Before 1982, these money-supply figures would have frightened us, but I wouldn't interpret substantial weakness in reserves or the aggregates as signaling tight monetary policy now,&quot; says Paul A. Spindt, a Federal Reserve economist in Washington, D.C. &quot;Short-term interest rates don't seem to be particularly high given the low growth of reserves.&quot;    Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank, Pittsburgh, says &quot;the relationships between the money supply and the economy are too loose to consider seriously.&quot; The &quot;rapid growth in the money supply a couple years ago didn't bring inflation or a boom,&quot; says Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. and Economic Advisors Inc. &quot;Likewise, weak growth of the M's shouldn't be taken as a prediction of a downturn.&quot;    Mr. Hyman, who has been ranked the nation's No. 1 economist the past nine years by the trade publication Institutional Investor, isn't convinced. There already &quot;are clear signs the economy is slowing&quot; in the wake of the Oct. 19 stock market crash, he says, citing rising unemployment claims, a decline in the index of leading economic indicators, weak manufacturing orders and a slowdown in consumer borrowing.    Warnings that anemic money growth is a reflection of a miserly credit policy by the Fed turned into a chorus late last year among &quot;monetarist&quot; economists, including Beryl W. Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Sprinkel, like other monetarists, stresses slow and steady money growth as the key to a moderate expansion with low inflation.    Until recently, however, his advocacy of easier credit hasn't helped the Reagan administration shore up the dollar against major currencies. &quot;Ironically, Beryl Sprinkel may be more responsible than the Fed for lower money growth in the U.S. by his encouragement of policies which led to a capital flight from dollar-denominated assets,&quot; says David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc.    The perception that slow money growth will lead to recession &quot;is misplaced,&quot; says Mr. Hale, who thinks world-wide capital flows increasingly are responsible for fluctuations in domestic money supplies. &quot;Expectations of currency changes trigger movements in international portfolio balances that overwhelm the central banks' ability to control domestic money supply measures,&quot; he says.    &quot;How can U.S. monetary policy be so tight if our currency is so weak ?&quot; he asks, noting that tight monetary policies typically raise a currency's value by making it relatively scarce.    During the past three years, there has been a major shift in foreign currency liabilities held by multinational corporations and individuals. Since 1984, for instance, the ratio of Eurodollar deposits to other currency deposits held by companies and individuals plummeted to 2 1/2-to-1 by last June from 6-to-1, according to data compiled by the Bank for International Settlements.    &quot;Now I suspect the ratio is even smaller,&quot; says Mr. Hale. He also notes that West Germany and, to a lesser extent, Japan have had difficulty reducing a big surge in their money supplies because of capital flows. &quot;If the Germans raised interest rates to slow their money growth, it would still increase because of the influx of foreign portfolio funds&quot; attracted to higher German rates.    Whatever the case, the slowdown in U.S. money growth is just about over, but not because of a change in Fed policy, says Christopher L. Snyder Jr., president of Loan Pricing Corp., a financial information company here. &quot;The monetary aggregates hadn't kept up because the nation's loan demand was falling through much of the past year as companies reduced a build-up in inventories,&quot; he says. &quot;As the cash came in, bank loans to finance the inventories got paid off and the deposits used to pay for the loans got extinguished.&quot;    During the past eight weeks, however, &quot;loan demand has started to rise again, driven by a booming demand for exports,&quot; says Mr. Snyder. As a result, growth in the various money stocks will accelerate this year, he predicts.    The Fed's Mr. Spindt says &quot;the increasing integration of the U.S. economy into the world economy&quot; partly explains the widening gap between the economy's performance and money-supply measures. Nevertheless, the slow money growth of the past year still &quot;represents a puzzle with potentially important consequences. It's getting a lot of serious attention at the Fed.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Bond prices tumbled as investor fear of inflation gripped the credit markets. Prices of some actively-traded 30-year government bonds fell 1 3/8 points, or $13.75 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate and municipal bonds also fell sharply.    The declines were sparked by a Labor Department report that the nation's unemployment rate fell to 5.8% of the civilian work force from 5.9% in November as non-farm payrolls increased to 326,000. &quot;This came as a total shock to the bond market,&quot; said Dennis Gartman, a financial futures analyst and president of a firm bearing his name in Portsmouth, Va. &quot;All the people who lost their jobs on Wall Street are asking themselves whether the (stock) crash ever occurred.&quot;    The market also weakened amid a surge in a broad basket of commodities in futures markets.    The Treasury's latest 30-year bond fell to 97 26/32 from 99 6/32 Thursday, while the yield rose to 9.09% from 8.95%. Earlier in the day, the issue fell as low as 96 31/32 to yield 9.17%, a move that helped widen the sell-off in the stock market. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds closed at 1239.31, down 12.12 points. The index ranged between 1225.94 and 1239.96.    The Treasury's latest 10-year note fell to 99 5/8 from 100 13/32, while the yield rose to 8.93% from 8.81%.    Among short-term interest rates, the rate on federal funds, or reserves banks lend each other overnight, averaged 6.81%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A). That was down from Thursday's average of 6.91%, the Fed said. Rates on the Treasury's latest three-month bills declined to 5.60% bid from 5.80% bid Thursday. The rate on the Treasury's new six-month bills fell to 6.28% bid from 6.34% bid. </TEXT></DOC>
