The report, summarized in the leading newspapers, was called ``AJudgment of Effectiveness and Directions of Action in the Field ofShaping and Protecting the Environment.'' The party daily TrybunaLudu said, ``It should be called `Judgment of Uneffectiveness'.''   According to the report, Poland ranks second in Europe in sulfurdioxide emission, most Polish rivers lack drinkable water, mostbeaches on the Baltic Sea have been closed, and the amount ofindustrial wastes in the country has increased by nearly half in thepast five years.   A spokeswoman at the academy, the country's foremost researchinstitution, said the report was prepared by a committee of theacademy earlier this year and was now being made public.   ``There has been a complete breakdown of the state of naturalbalance in 27 areas'' inhabited by one-third of Poland's 38 millionpeople, the newspaper Zycie Warszawy said in its summary of thereport.   ``It shows in a degradation of the natural order, incapability(by the environment) for self-cleansing and an increase of diseasesresulting from the state of the environment.''   The report said that economic losses stemming from environmentalproblems were also huge, amounting to 10 percent of the country'sannual national revenue.   It said industrial dust in the air of the southern Silesiaregion, the center of Poland's mining and metal industries, had acarcinogenic influence on living tissue, causing cancer or geneticdeformations.   The government newspaper Rzeczpospolita suggested that increasedenforcement of environmental laws and other legal remedies should beused to improve the environment.   In recent weeks, government officials have expressed increasingconcern about the environment, and the newly appointed government ofPrime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski has said that addressingenvironmental problems will be one of his top priorities.   In one of its first acts, the government permitted the closing ofa chromium-producing factory near Wroclaw, in Silesia, forenvironmental reasons.   There is also a budding independent environmental movement, withat least two groups of activists _ Freedom and Peace and the PolishEcological Party _ devoted to pointing out environmental problems.</TEXT></DOC>
