L. 100-77, the Stewart B. McKinneyHomeless Assistance Act of 1987, contains two provisions which affect theVeterans' Job Training Act. The deadline for a veteran to apply for traininghas been extended to December 31, 1987. The deadline for beginning a trainingprogram has been extended to June 30, 1988. The Veterans Administration(VA) is adopting amendments to andSection; 21.4632(e) which will implementthese provisions of law. The VA finds that good cause exists for making the amended regulation finalwithout previous publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking. The changescontained in the regulation are directly based upon the law. The VA mustmake the Code of Federal Regulations agree with the law. Public participationin this rulemaking is, therefore, unnecessary (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)). Since a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is unnecessary and will not be published,this change does not come within the term ``rule'' as defined in the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601(2), and is, therefore, not subjectto the requirements of that act. Nevertheless, these amended regulationswill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities as they are defined in the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. Althoughsmall entities will be affected by the extention of the Veterans' Job TrainingAct, all the effects will derive from the change in the law upon whichthe regulations are based. The regulations themselves will have no effectupon small entities. The VA finds that good cause exists for making the amended regulation,like the section of the law it implements, retroactively effective on July22, 1987. To achieve the maximum benefit of this legislation for the affectedindividuals, it is necessary to implement the provision of law as soonas possible. A delayed effective date would be contrary to statutory design;would complicate administration of the provision of law; and might resultin denial of a benefit to a veteran who is entitled by law to it (5 U.S.C.553(d)(3)). The VA has determined that the amended regulation does not contain a majorrule as the term is defined by Executive Order 12291, entitled FederalRegulation. The regulation will not have a $100 million annual effect onthe economy and will not cause a major increase in costs or prices foranyone. It will have no significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for the program affectedby this regulation is 64.121. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 21 </ITAG>Civil rights, Claims, Education, Grant programs-education, Loan programs-education,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Schools, Veterans, Vocationaleducation, Vocational rehabilitation. <ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: January 14, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas K.
