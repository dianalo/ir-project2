The dependence of the nuclearpolarization on T and n is shown. These results show that not only optimaltemperature conditions are necessary to achieve a high nuclear polarization,but also density increase by means of the compression limits the nuclearpolarization. At temperatures of T{similar_to}.2 K nuclear polarizationP=99% is attainable up to densities of 10/sup 18/ cm/sup -3/. 3 refs.;2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
