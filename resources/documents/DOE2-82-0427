<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-82-0427 </DOCNO><TEXT>For the first time the multichannel version of the hyperspherical coordinatemethod is applied to compute the ground-state energies of He atom andH/sup -/, Li/sup +/, Be/sup ++/ ions. The convergence of the hypersphericaladiabatic basis is studied numerically. When solving the system of radialequations, account was taken of one to six channels; and in the expansionover bispherical harmonics use was made of the terms with orbital momentain the range from zero to l/sub max/=3. It is shown that for determiningthe energies up to about 0.0001 a.u. it is necessary to solve a systemof at least three radial equations. Good agreement is obtained with analogouscalculations by other methods. It has been shown that the multichannelversion of the hyperspherical coordinate method can be successfully usedto calculate the spectra of two-electron systems. 13 refs.; 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
