Fujitsu on Thursday introduced a thin new laptop-size personalcomputer, the FM R-CARD, which uses a full-size keyboard but weighsonly 2.2 pounds - less than half the weight of many other laptops.   It uses power-saving technology developed by Poqet Computer, aU.S. company that sells a miniature 1.1-pound computer in theUnited States. Fujitsu owns 58 percent of Poqet and manufacturesits computer, which is about half the size of a normal laptop.   Such technology, which cuts electricity to circuits that are notbeing used, is important for portable computers because it extendsbattery life and allows the use of smaller, lighter batteries.   Instead of the heavy battery packs used by most portablecomputers, which must be recharged every few hours, Fujitsu's FMR-CARD runs for eight hours on two regular alkaline penlightbatteries.   The FM R-CARD, going on sale in Japan in January for 238,000yen, or about $1,900, uses a unique Fujitsu computing standard andis not directly compatible with computers made by InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. Officials said they don't plan to marketthe laptop overseas, but wouldn't be surprised if Poqet introducesa similar model that is IBM-compatible.   Earlier this week, Japan's NEC Corp. announced a diary-sizecomputer, the PC-98 HA, which weighs 2.4 pounds. Because of itssmall keyboard, NEC officials said they expect it will be usedmostly for data retrieval, scheduling and light word-processing.   The NEC model, which also is not IBM-compatible, goes on sale inJapan next week at 198,000 yen, or about $1,585. No plans have beenmade for overseas marketing, officials said.   Like the Fujitsu, the NEC model uses plug-in memory cardsinstead of floppy disks.   The cards, which look like thick credit cards, contain an arrayof memory chips and can be used to store both programs and data,like floppy disks. But they are smaller, use much less electricityand are 100 times faster, said Yoshihiro Satoh, general manager ofFujitsu's personal computer systems engineering division. Inaddition, computers using them don't need a floppy disc drive,saving weight.   The cards are expected to begin appearing on many other portablecomputers following an agreement last spring between U.S. andJapanese industry groups that established uniform standards forthem.   Spreadsheet and word-processing programs already are availableon memory cards, and Japanese software makers plan to producemagazine-like cards containing ``lifestyle'' data such asrestaurant listings and tourist guides.   But one obstacle will be price, with program cards costing aminimum of about 10,000 yen, or $80 dollars, to produce, Fujitsuofficials said. By contrast, floppy disks cost less than a dollarto make.   ``It will take a while, but memory cards will catch on,'' saidKatsushi Shiga, an analyst for Dataquest Japan, the Japanese branchof a U.S. computer industry research company. ``Experiencedcomputer users will be slower to adapt because they tend to feeluneasy without floppy disks, but new users are quickly acceptingthem.''   Also this week, Intel Corp. of the United States announced inJapan a new powerful microprocessor, the 386 SL, that will allowlaptop makers to increase performance while curbing electricalconsumption. Like the Fujitsu laptop, it monitors the computer'scircuits and shuts off those not being used.</TEXT></DOC>
