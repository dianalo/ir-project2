(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Bob Martinez wants to developAmerica's first commercial spaceport here, but the project faces anumber of hurdles and an uncertain future.   Martinez said Friday that he will ask the Legislature next weekfor $500,000 for a feasibility study of the project calledSpaceport Florida.   He was vague about how the spaceport would be developed andoperated, saying only that ``we feel with the money we can acquirethe necessary consultation and advice.''   If the Legislature approves the money, part of a supplementalbudget request, the state Department of Commerce will seek bids ona feasibility study that would begin in July.   However, legislative leaders already have warned they expectdifficulty finding money for new programs in the 1988 sessionbeginning April 5.   The governor spoke Friday to about 80 aerospace executives andlegislative leaders outside the Space Museum at the Cape CanaveralAir Force Station.   Martinez said the facilities at Cape Canaveral and the adjacentKennedy Space Center give Florida a clear advantage over Hawaii andother states contemplating developing facilities for commerciallaunches.   ``We have the tracking systems, the launch pads, the supportservices, and most importantly we have the people to make SpaceportFlorida a reality,'' he said.   Asked how a commercial customer would benefit from going toSpaceport Florida rather than dealing directly with a rocket maker,as is done now, Martinez replied, ``Maybe our role is to providethe opportunities for the companies to do business.   ``We could guarantee them a launch date months in advance,'' headded.   Before reporters could ask how, he cut off questioning.   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the AirForce have launch pad priority. It is doubtful Spaceport Floridacould guarantee a launch date unless it builds its own launch pads,control centers and tracking facilities, an expensive undertaking.   All launch facilities in the United States are controlled by thefederal government, and commercial payloads such as communicationssatellites have to compete for rocket space with NASA and DefenseDepartment launches.   U.S. launches have been scarce since the space shuttleChallenger and two major unmanned rockets exploded in 1986. Thishas created a huge backlog of payloads, and the military and NASAwill have priority when shuttle flights resume, now scheduled forAugust.   The United States is building a new family of unmanned rockets,but these are also heavly booked by the Pentagon, NASA andcommercial customers dealing directly with rocket makers.   Many American companies are seeking launch services from theEuropeans and Japanese, but those launch pads also are crowded.   ``Because of the backlog of commercial payloads, there is agreat demand in the private sector for launch facilities,''Martinez said.   ``Our goal is to launch one commercial mission each month fromSpaceport Florida,'' he said. ``At the current rate of $45 millionper launch, this would directly inject $540 million per year intoour state's economy.''   He predicted the spaceport also would attract much of theprivate sector space industry, which he projected would be worth$60 billion by the end of the century.</TEXT></DOC>
