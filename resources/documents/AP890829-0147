AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter saidTuesday a provisional government will take over on sept 1,inauguration day under the constitution, and the opposition said itwould be dictatorship ``behind a new facade.''   Also Tuesday, the Defense Forces said five opposition partymembers were arrested near the Costa Rican border on charges ofthreatening national security.   No official announcement has been made of the government's formor makeup, but most observers expect it to be a junta approved byGen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the military and police commander whowields the real power in Panama.   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma said Tuesday ``all possibleformulas of government'' were being evaluated and ``we will do thebest for the country.'' he said.   Ritter said it would be a ``provisional government with thewidest possible political support.''   The opposition, which international observers say won a 3-1victory in the May 7 election, said it would not be involved in thenew regime. The government Noriega sponsors annulled the election ongrounds of U.S. ``interference.''   The opposition was invited to join a junta but refused, saying itwould continue its campaign to oust Noriega as head of the DefenseForces.   ``We refused the offer for a share of bureaucratic spoils,'' saidRicardo Arias Calderon, opposition vice presidential candidate andleader of the Christian Democratic Party.   He said the new government will be ``a continuation of themilitary dictatorship'' and the opposition expects ``repression andthe crisis to continue and the dictatorship to go on behind a newfacade.''   U.S. officials have said the United States will not recognize thenew government.   ``There can be no accomodation with a government in which Noriegais the real power,'' said a U.S. source who requested anonymity.   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on charges of drugtrafficking and laundering money. Washington applied economicsanctions in an attempt to force him from power.   The general calls the campaign against him a disguised attempt torenege on the 1977 treaties that turn the Panama Canal over toPanama at the end of the century.   Solis Palma said Tuesday: ``The permanence of Gen. Noriega at thehead of the Defense Forces is part of the struggle for nationalliberation. We cannot accept an improvement of relations with theUnited States based on the acceptance of the removal of an officialof the Panamanian government under pressure.''   Meanwhile, a communique read over National Radio said the fiveopposition members arrested planned to destroy bridges and provokeviolence and had undergone guerrilla training on the Costa Ricanside of the border.   It said the suspects were members of the Christian DemocraticParty but gave no other details. There was no immediate comment fromthe party.   Defense Forces sources in the Chiriqui Province near the borderwho asked not to be named said the arrests had taken place over thepast few days.   Three weeks ago, the Costa Rican government denied reports in thePanamanian press that rebels were training in Villa Neilly near theborder.</TEXT></DOC>
