High-tech weapons maynot win the war against Iraq, or even assure that it's ashort one. But they will certainly change the nation'sattitude toward its own technological prowess -- and withthat bring hope that the nation can boost its long-termgrowth rate.   When polled last May by The Wall Street Journal and NBCNews, 63% of American voters said they thought the U.S.trailed Japan in science and technology. The sentiment wasparticularly strong among younger people.</LP><TEXT>   But now, many of those same people must be having secondthoughts. For 11 days, they've heard the stories of Tomahawkcruise missiles following electronic maps to pinpointtargets. They've sat transfixed as the nightly news showedvideos of &quot;smart&quot; bombs guided by lasers to the doors ofstorage facilities or the ventilation shafts of buildings.They've watched the intrepid Patriot missiles rising timeafter time, night after night, to meet their Scud missiletargets. Sony Walkmen and VCRs fade in comparison.                                                                                                          &quot;It's incredible,&quot; says Michael Dertouzos, director of theMIT Laboratory for Computer Science. &quot;We have immensecapability in this country, if you think of it in terms oftechnological know-how, technological applications, and theinvention of effective gadgetry. We are fantastic. Second tonone.&quot;                                                                                                          But while American technology is succeeding on thebattlefield, the fact remains that it too often fails in themarketplace. The nation's high-tech industries are rapidlylosing market share throughout the world. The informationrevolution that swept the country in the past decade hasproduced distressingly little in economic returns.   The problem weighs on the nation's economic outlook forthe next decade. Despite its technological leadership, theU.S. continues to suffer from sluggish increases inproductivity, a key factor in long-term economic performance.Unless the link between technology and the U.S. economy canbe strengthened, the economy's future will remain cloudy.   The differences between military and commercial technologyare clear enough. The Pentagon is willing to paystratospheric sums for its weaponry; commercial buyers arenot. For $600, those fabled toilet seats may be the world'sbest, but few will buy them. &quot;The Japanese compete on price,&quot;says former Defense Secretary Harold Brown, and as a rule&quot;defense is not a price competition.&quot;   Manufacturing for the global market also requires timelydelivery and high quality in mass production. Defensecontractors can afford to ignore those demands; commercialmanufacturers do so at their peril.   Raytheon Co. is a case in point. Its Patriot missiles areweaponry heroes of the Gulf war. But Raytheon's attempts inthe late 1970s and early 1980s to turn its defense technologyinto a successful commercial data-processing business failed.The company finally sold off its data-processing business in1984.   &quot;In almost every area, we lead in science, and in mostareas we lead in the creation of technology,&quot; says B.R.Inman, former deputy director of the Central IntelligenceAgency and a member of the executive committee of the Councilon Competitiveness. &quot;Where we lose our shirts is inimplementation.&quot;   Why? Clyde Prestowitz, who heads a new think tank calledthe Economic Strategy Institute, says it's largely a questionof national will. &quot;Why can we make Patriot missiles and notVCRs?&quot; he asks. &quot;Because we want to.&quot; For the first decadesafter World War II, the nation concentrated on the militarythreat from the Soviet Union and took its economic prosperityfor granted.                                                                                                          That's bound to change. The Soviet threat has declinedand, despite the Gulf war, defense spending will probablyresume its downward path in the years ahead. The best hope isthat America will channel these skills and energy that haveproved successful in the defense effort into commercialactivities.                                                                                                          Erich Bloch, former director of the National ScienceFoundation, says part of the task lies with the federalgovernment. &quot;Look at the federal research and developmentbudget,&quot; he says. &quot;Roughly 64% went to defense. If we spendas much on civilian technology, we could do a lot better.&quot;   Mr. Inman says American corporations must also change tomeet the challenge. &quot;I sit on six corporate boards,&quot; he says,&quot;and I watch management decisions driven not by looking atthe opportunities technology offers, but rather by amandatory need to provide a quarterly return.&quot;   Changing those practices won't be easy. But they are theforemost challenge for the U.S. economy in the 1990s. If thenation can once again learn to harness its technologicaleminence for commercial purposes, it may well retain a placeat the forefront of industrial nations.   ---    Declining Market Share of U.S. High-Tech Industries                                                                                                                                                      1980   1988                                                                                                          Fiber Optics                                 73%    42%   Semiconductors                               60     36   Supercomputers                              100     76   DRAMs                                        56     20   Machine Tools                                18      7                                                                                                          Source: Council on Competitiveness</TEXT></DOC>
