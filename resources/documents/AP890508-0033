Some had voted early Sunday morning and had come back to watchthe count proceed into the night.   ``They're not going to steal it this time. I'm going to stayhere until dawn,'' said a woman in a red blouse and pearls.   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara claimed thegovernment that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega controls planned tosteal the election, as it is thought to have done in 1984.   ``They're rabid for Endara here. I couldn't even wear my(Carlos) Duque button, I was afraid they'd spit at me,'' said WilmaReina, among the few government supporters in this well-to-doopposition stronghold.   Opposition to Noriega is strong in Panama's business communitywhile the general gets much support from the lower classes.   At box 2472, one of seven set up in a dusty empty lot, electionofficials had sat in a shed at a rough wooden table with partypollwatchers arrayed behind.   Voters stepped up to the bench and profferred theiridentification cards, which were checked by all and punched.   An elderly man was guided to the correct booth; a man whose IDcard did not quite match the registration list was allowed to casthis ballot after a quick discussion.   ``The instructions say to assume minor problems are justmistakes or typos,'' said one official.   By the time the polls closed 281 people had voted out of 348registered to box 2472.   ``I was hoping for a higher turnout,'' fretted one oppositionworker. ``We need to win big here.''   Poll workers burned unused ballots and other voting material onthe ground in front of the booth; smoke drifted across the boothsfor hours.   At 7 p.m., two hours after the polls closed, the count wasprogressing slowly as more than 200 people watched at the sevenbooths.   Poll workers and watchers took turns opening envelopes andreading the contents aloud. Laughter broke out when white cardswith the words ``I abstain'' printed in purple ink fell out of twoenvelopes.   ``The slower it goes, the better for us,'' muttered a lonesoldier from Noriega's Defense Forces.   After the cardboard urn was finally emptied, at 9:30 p.m.,everyone read their totals; when counts varied, the ballots werecounted one-by-one.   An argument arose over how to inscribe the totals on theofficial tally that goes to the Election Tribunal _ in figures oralso written out.   ``If you don't write it out they'll put a one in front andchange the vote,'' said Alcibiades Broce, an Endara pollwatcher.   Eduardo Martin, poll president, replied angrily.   ``You should at least consult me before you decide,'' he said.``There was nothing in the instructions about writing out anynumbers.''   ``Stop discussing it and let's move on. We're wasting time and Ihave a date,'' said a government party poll watcher.   Meanwhile, poll secretary Yadira Funt was scribbling busily.   ``I'm writing them out and that's the end of it. You're allboobs,'' she announced.   The total came to 229 votes for Endara, 43 for Duque, seven nullballots and two abstentions. ``This is not our territory. Theyrolled over us here,'' said Alexis Tulloch, a Duque man.   He gazed glumly at the BMWs and Mercedes Benz parked nearby andsaid he had gotten up at 4 a.m. to take the bus from Tocumen, aworking class district 16 miles to the east.   Only 25 people were still watching as the total was announced.The woman in the red blouse who had announced she planned to seethe dawn was not among them.</TEXT></DOC>
