Numerous chemicals were screened in various laboratories,but clinically available chemical protectors were not discovered. Itwas concluded in 1962 that although a number of compounds may be capableof efficient protection of mice when given before exposure to X or {gamma}rays, none could be considered a practical agent for protection of humans.On the basis of synthesis, stability, and effectiveness of oral administration,as well as dose-reduction properties, S-(2-aminoethyl)isothiouronium(AET) would seem to be the drug of choice. However, preliminary testsof AET in humans indicated that the toxicity may be far too great. Newchemical protectors have been reported, following two different linesof research in Japan and in the United States. In Japan, an adrenochromederivative, adrenochrome monoguanylhydrazone methanesulfonate (AMM) anda new sulfhydrl compound, 2-mercaptopropionylglycine (MPG), which areboth effective in much lower doses than their toxic dose in mice, werereported. In the United States, after a large screening of various kindsof derivatives of cysteamine, WR-2721, S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioicacid was reported to have a very high dose-reduction factor of 2.5 ormore, thus effective even at a less toxic dose. To make use of thesechemicals in cases of cancer radiotherapy, differential protection betweentumor and normal tissues has to be established. Studies along this linehave been also carried out with WR-2721 and MPG. The results obtainedso far are promising for the improvement of radiotherapy. In this chapter,experimental studies on these chemicals are reviewed, emphasizing theauthors own research.</TEXT></DOC>
