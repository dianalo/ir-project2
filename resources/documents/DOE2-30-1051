Initialplanning for the facility included performance assessments of possibledisposal technologies. The determination of input parameters and theinterpretation of the results provided valuable insight into the processof performance prediction. Factors such as leach mechanisms and solubilitycontrols of migrating species required particularly careful evaluation.12 references, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
