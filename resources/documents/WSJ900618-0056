A federal jury in Washington awarded the damages in 1985for breach of contract, negligence and fraud. The damageswere awarded to Murray Drabkin, the bankruptcy trustee forAuto-Train, who filed the suit in 1983. Auto-Train ceasedoperations in 1981.</LP><TEXT>   The lawsuit charged that Chicago-based Grant Thornton,formerly Alexander Grant andamp; Co., failed to disclose in itsaudits that Auto-Train used funds withheld for federalpayroll taxes to meet its cash needs. The lawsuit alsocharged that the audits overestimated the value ofAuto-Train's assets. Because of these omissions, the lawsuitsaid, the audits failed to sound alarms about Auto-Train'sworsening financial plight.   But the appeals court, in a 3-0 decision written by JudgeStephen Williams, said the evidence on which the jury reliedfailed to show that Grant Thornton caused or contributed toAuto-Train's problems. Moreover, the appeals court noted thatGrant Thornton's audits included qualified opinions on thecompany's stability.   The appeals court ruling didn't establish any new legalprinciples. But Kathryn Oberly, a Washington lawyer for GrantThornton, said that with lawsuits against accounting firmsbecoming more common, &quot;We're delighted to have the appealscourt recognize that, regardless of how badly or how well theauditing firm did its job, plaintiffs must prove&quot; that theaccountants caused the problem for which a suit seeks to holdthem liable.</TEXT></DOC>
