We received requests from the AmalgamatedClothing and Textile Workers Union, AFL-CIO, a domestic interested party,and the Government of Uruguay, that we conduct administrative reviews ofthis order. We published the initiation on August 19, 1987 (52 FR 31056)for the period January 1, 1986 through December 31, 1986, and on August30, 1988 (53 FR 33163) for the period January 1, 1987 through December31, 1987. The Department has now conducted its review in accordance withsection 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act''). <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review </ITAG>The United States, under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council,has developed a system of tariff classification based on the internationalharmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January 1, 1989, the UnitedStates fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``HTS''), asprovided for in section 1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s). Imports covered by this review are shipments of Uruguayan leather wearingapparel and parts and pieces thereof. During the period of review, suchmerchandise was classifiable under item numbers 791.7620, 791.7640 and791.7660 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated. Theseproducts are currently classifiable under HTS item numbers 4203.10.4030,4203.10.4060 and 4203.10.4090. The written description remains dispositive.The review covers the period January 1, 1986 through December 31, 1987,and four programs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>(1) Export Tax Refunds (``ETRs'')On July 25, 1983, the Government of Uruguay instituted a system of indirecttax refunds on exports of leather wearing apparel (Decree 289/983) forall shipments of the merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1983.Until May 24, 1984, the amounts of these refunds, which are issued in theform of tax certificates, ranged from 1.7 to 2.9 percent of the f.o.b.value of the merchandise, depending on the type of leather used in thegarment. The Government of Uruguay suspended this program from May 25,1984 (Decree 200/984) until July 10, 1985, when it was reinstated withthe same or slightly lower (1.7 to 2.6 percent) refund rates (Decree 309/985).In our review of the period April 17, 1982 through December 31, 1983, weestablished the requisite linkage between the payment of ETRs and the incidenceof indirect taxes. In that review and in our last review, we verified thatthe total indirect tax incidence of leather wearing apparel exports tothe United States was higher than the rebate rates. There were no changesin this program or in the amounts of the ETRs during the period of review.Accordingly, we preliminary determine that there were no overrebates underthis program during the review period.(2) Bonification PaymentsBonification payments are export rebates of 22 percent of the value ofthe processed wool portion of the leather wearing apparel. Because thesepayments are limited to exporters and not linked to the payment of indirecttaxes, we preliminarily determine that this program confers a subsidy.The Uruguayan government made such payments on shipments to the UnitedStates from one exporter in both 1986 and 1987. Although the weighted-averagecountry-wide benefit from this program was greater than <T3>de minimis</T3>, the aggregate benefit from all programs was <T3>de minimis</T3> for nine of the ten known exporters of the subjectmerchandise during the period January 1, 1986 through December 31, 1986,and 12 of the 13 known exporters during the period January 1, 1987 throughDecember 31, 1987. Therefore, we calculated company-specific rates in accordancewith andSection; 355.22(d)(3)(ii) of the Commerce Department's regulations,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52306) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.22).Because these payments can be tied to specific shipments, we calculatedthe benefit by dividing the amount received by the recipient firm on U.S.shipments in each year by the total value of its exports from Uruguay tothe United States in that year. On this basis, we preliminarily determinethe benefits udner this program to be zero for nine firms and 2.10 percent<T3>ad valorem</T3> for all other firms for the period January 1, 1986through December 31, 1986. For the period January 1, 1987 through December31, 1987, we preliminarily determine the benefits to be zero for 12 firmsand 3.21 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for all others.(3) Uncollected Social Security TaxesOn May 11, 1982, the Government of Uruguay notified the Department thatit had ceased its efforts to collect social security taxes that the leatherwearing apparel industry had not paid in 1980.Because the Government of Uruguay was not able to collect these taxes,we consider the uncollected taxes to be a grant given on the date the governmentofficially declared the taxes uncollectable. We consider the amount ofthe grant to be the total amount of the uncollected taxes plus the interestwhich would have accrued from June 16, 1981 (the date on which the Uruguayangovernment agreed to eliminate all benefits on leather wearing apparelexports to the United States) to May 11, 1982. We used as our benchmarkinterest rate the prime rate available in Uruguay in 1981.To calculate the benefit, we used a declining balance methodology. We allocatedthe grant over 11 years, the average useful life of assets in the leatherwearing apparel industry, according to the Asset Guideline Classes of theInternal Revenue Service. We used as the discount rate the short-term 1982interest rate, as published by the Central Bank of Uruguay, because wehave no information on long-term interest rates or on the weighted costof capital in the leather wearing apparel industry for that year.We allocated the benefit attributable to each year of the review periodover total Uruguayan production of the merchandise for that year. On thisbasis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program to be 0.003percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for the period January 1, 1986 through December 31,1986, and 0.001 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for the 1987 period.(4) Preferential Export FinancingCentral Bank Circular No. 1.229 of July 5, 1985, instituted a system ofshort-term preferential rate loans for ``non-traditional'' exports. Leatherwearing apparel is considered a non-traditional export. However, Article3 of Decree 309/985 of July 10, 1985 (the Decree which reinstituted theETRs), prohibited these loans on certain specified exports, including leatherwearing apparel.Accordingly, we preliminarily determine that this program was not usedby Uruguayan leather wearing apparel exporters during the review period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Firms Not Receiving Benefits</ITAG>A. We preliminarily determine that the following nine firms received <T3>de minimis</T3> benefits during the period January 1, 1986 throughDecember 31, 1986:1. Cubalan, S.A.2. Osami, S.A.3. Orolon, S.A.4. Ness, LTDA5. Fair Play, LTDA6. Sirfil, S.A.7. Modur, S.A.8. Laren, S.A.9. Paris New York, S.A.B. We preliminarily determine that the following twelve firms received<T3>de minimis</T3> benefits during the period January 1, 1987 throughDecember 31, 1987:1. Cubalan, S.A.2. Osami, S.A.3. Orolon, S.A.4. Ness, LTDA5. Exportador Esporadico6. Cleson, S.A.7. Orwix, S.R.L.8. Modur, S.A.9. Union Euroamericana, S.A.10. Raulin, S.A.11. Ladibel, S.A.12. Bicron, S.A.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of Review</ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy tobe 0.003 percent for nine firms and 2.10 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for all other firms for shipments of Uruguayan leatherwearing apparel exported to the United States during the period January1, 1986 through December 31, 1986. For the period January 1, 1987 throughDecember 31, 1987, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy to be 0.001percent for 12 firms and 3.21 percent ad valorem for all other firms. TheDepartment considers any rate less than 0.50 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> to be <T3>de minimis.</T3>The Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, withoutregard to countervailing duties, shipments of this merchandise from thenine firms listed in section A above and to assess countervailing dutiesof 2.10 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all other shipments of themerchandise exported from Uruguay on or after January 1, 1986 and on orbefore December 31, 1986. The Department also intends to instruct the CustomsService to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, shipmentsof this merchandise from the 12 firms listed in section B above and toassess countervailing duties of 3.21 percent of the f.o.b. invoice pricefor all shipments exported on or after January 1, 1987 and on or beforeDecember 31, 1987.Further, the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to waivecash deposits of estimated countervailing duties, as provided by section751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, on shipments of this merchandise from the12 firms listed in section B above and to collect cash deposits of estimatedcountervailing duties of 3.21 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on shipmentsof this merchandise from all other firms which are entered, or withdrawnfrom warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication ofthe final results of this review.Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultswithin 30 days of the date of publication of this notice and may requestdisclosure and/or a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication.Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days from the date of publicationor the first workday thereafter.
