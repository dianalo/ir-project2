<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0116 </DOCNO><TEXT>In Denmark and Sweden modern national wind energy programmes started around1975 to investigate the possibilities for using wind power and eventuallyerect windmills. Wind power development in Denmark and Sweden is compared,based upon documents and interviews with representatives for utilitiesand governmental authorities in both countries. The study was concludedin 1986 and it focuses on the following factors: energy systems; historicaltradition; energy policy; scale of technology and attitudes. In Denmarkfar more windmills have been erected than in Sweden. The total effectof small scale windmills in Denmark was about 60 MW in 1985, and largescale units nearly 8 MW. Late 1985 the Danish government decided thatanother 100 MW effect should be installed. Medium scale units (around200 kW) are mostly to be used. In Sweden the main and almost sole activityhas been to build two large scale prototypes (2 and 3 MW respectively).Most of the explanation to this may probably be found in the differentenergy systems of the two countries. Sweden has much hydro power of itsown and, so far, one of the world's larger nuclear programmes. The priceper kWh is also very low (0,25 SEK). Denmark never installed nuclearpower, and wind power is one of her few domestic energy sources. 7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
