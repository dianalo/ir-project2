Judge Fred Ugast of District of Columbia Superior Court ruledKhiem incompetent to testify about the strangulation deaths of hiselderly parents, who had lived in Washington since resigning fromtheir diplomatic posts with the old South Vietnamese government in1963.   Ugast issued his ruling ``with great reluctance,'' after acourt-appointed psychologist examined the defendant Thursday andfound him ``profoundly delusional.''   Ugast ordered Khiem returned to St. Elizabeths Hospital, a citymental institution, for 90 days. He said the court would thenreconsider whether Khiem could testify.   Khiem, 62, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder inthe July 1986 deaths of his father, Tran Van Chuong, 88, formerSouth Vietnamese ambassador to the United States, and his mother,Nam Tran Chuong, 82, former observer to the United Nations.   The defendant has stated that his parents were killed because ofhis father's alleged part in the assassination of President Kedyand South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem.   Neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys have turned up anyevidence to support Khiem's assertions, and his attorneys arguedthat his grandiose claims and the finding of the court psychiatristwere reason enough to declare him unfit for trial.   Ugast had ruled in November that the defendant should standtrial but be evaluated throughout the legal proceedings to makecertain he could assist his attorneys in preparing his defense.   Madame Nhu was first lady of Vietnam for her bachelorbrother-in-law Diem, and has lived in exile near Rome since theU.S.-backed coup that resulted in the killing of Diem and herhusband Ngo Dinh Nhu in 1963.   She was known as the dragon lady because of her harsh attitudetoward the Buddhists in her country. Her parents resigned theirdiplomatic positions to protest that attitude.</TEXT></DOC>
