The suit was filed by the Service Employees International Uniontwo days after the federal Environmental Protection Agency refusedthe union's request that it draft new asbestos guidelines forpublic and commercial buildings.   An EPA spokesman said the agency would have no immediate commenton the suit.   Many states regulate asbestos and there are national regulationsgoverning asbestos use in new buildings and those under renovation.But the suit said the government is placing workers at risk by notexpanding to public and commercial buildings far more stringentnational regulations affecting asbestos in schools.   Those guidelines require inspections, abatement plans,notification of workers who potentially could be exposed toasbestos and certification of contractors who perform theinspections or remove asbestos.   Asbestos, used for insulation and fireproofing, has been linkedto lung cancer.   The suit, filed in federal district court in Washington,estimated that there are 700,000 public and commercial buildings inthe United States in which asbestos poses potential health problems.   ``Unreasonable risk exists which requires the initiation by EPAof a rulemaking proceeding,'' the union said in the suit, whichnames the agency and its administrator, William Reilly, asdefendants.   ``EPA is well aware that in many, perhaps most, of thesebuildings, no efforts have been made to identify asbestos or toalert building occupants so that minimal precautions may betaken,'' SEIU President John J. Sweeney said in announcing thefiling. ``The agency's refusal to act confirms that it would ratherstudy risk than take control of it.''</TEXT></DOC>
