Of these eight, fivemade comments worth reviewing for the reasons they came toAmerica. These are shortened and excerpted as follows:   1. &quot;. . . Hitler would invade Switzerland.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   2. &quot;. . . from Nazi Germany in 1937.&quot;   3. &quot;. . . fleeing Castro and his communist thugs.&quot;   4. &quot;. . . the Nazis broke into our house.&quot;   5. &quot;. . . for the same reasons as everyone.&quot;   The thought occurred to me that these people's familieshad some place to come to in order to escape totalitarianism.   If America loses its freedoms, where would the immigrantsof today go?   A.R. Patten Jr.   Arvada, Colo.   ---   Your article hardly shows an awareness of, or sensitivityto, the broad spectrum of immigrants who make up thediversity of the U.S. population.   Contrary to your statement, virtually every American doesnot know where he or she comes &quot;from.&quot; The largest part ofthe American black population, involuntary immigrants whosefamilies were torn apart before and after they reached ourshores, cannot trace where they come from (or can do so onlywith great difficulty and diligence).   I realize the thrust of your article was statements by 13naturalized prominent Americans and was not meant to berepresentative. I respect your right to make an editorialjudgment. However, why five Germans and three Canadians outof a group of 13 &quot;immigrants&quot;? (If you count the British-bornBob Hope and Swiss-born Madeleine Kunin, that is two morewhite Anglo-Saxon types in the top-heavy majority.) Where arethe Asians, Italians and Latin Americans who contribute soheavily to the monetary and cultural wealth of our country?There must be a few who are &quot;prominent.&quot;   Lucy Brody   Teaneck, N.J.   ---   I was puzzled by your selection. Note the followingbreakdown:   -- Five German-born   -- Three Canadian-born   -- Three other European-born   -- Two Caribbean-born   -- All Judeo-Christians   No Oriental-born, no South American-born, no African-born.Also, no representatives of large immigration countries suchas Ireland and Italy.   The professional breakdown also puzzles me:   -- Seven politicians   -- Two artists   -- Three academics   -- One business person   Are you saying America is the land of political, ratherthan business opportunity? That artists and capitalists areless relevant to our country's development?   Alain M. Breyton   Immigrant-Entrepreneur   Syracuse, N.Y.   ---   May I point out that nearly every one of the immigrants inthe article came to this country when the door was not quiteso open, because certain standards of decency and selectivitywere applied.   For the benefit of those too young to remember them, letme enumerate the three principal requirements for admission:   1) You had to prove that you would not become a publiccharge within the foreseeable future, either by beingpersonally solvent or by obtaining an affidavit of supportfrom a responsible and solvent person.   2) You had to give evidence of a clean criminal record inevery country where you had resided before coming to the U.S.   3) You had to produce a medical certificate that you werenot afflicted with any contagious or disabling disease.   In other words, we had an immigration policy in thosedays.   Paul G. Kafka   Bellevue, Wash.   ---   The immigration experience also includes theAfrican-Americans. We, too, know and remember that ourancestors were from a foreign land. We, too, have beentransplanted, although not by choice. The only difference isthat we were never entitled to a naturalization ceremony. Toobad you didn't choose some African-Americans to tell abouttheir or their relatives' immigration experiences -- theywould have a very different story. The weight of slavery'sshackles will never leave our memories.   Mikiko Murakata   Neptune, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
