David Waite said he was encouraged by the election of a newIranian president, the inauguration of a new U.S. president and aletter he received recently from British Foreign Secretary DouglasHurd that outlined an avenue for improved Anglo-Iranian relations.   ``I felt it was quite an important letter because he was sayingin fact that as long as Iran was ready to use her influence tosecure the release of Terry and the other hostages, Britain wouldlook to improve their relationships with Iran,'' Waite said in aBritish Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.   Citing the new administrations of Iranian President HashemiRafsanjani and President Bush as well as Hurd's letter, he said:``So there has been a lot of change and a lot of hope, I feel, forthe future.''
