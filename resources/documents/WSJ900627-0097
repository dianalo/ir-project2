The Food and Drug Administration, as part of a majorinitiative to require nutritional labels on almost allpackaged foods, is about to propose a way for consumers tocompare the nutrients in a food serving with the recommendeddaily allowances for fat, saturated and unsaturated fattyacids, salt, cholesterol, fiber and potassium.</LP><TEXT>   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivandisclosed the proposal yesterday when he gave further detailson three food-labeling rules that are to be formally proposedwithin a week or so.   For the first time, consumers would be able to tell from alabel what their daily intake of the seven substances shouldbe and what one serving of a particular food would furnish.Though there is a growing clamor for such health-relatedinformation, the food industry hasn't been able to provideso-called nutritional profiles because the government hasnever set recommended daily allowances for those sevennutrients. Under the sweeping new rules, the FDA would fillthis regulatory void by setting what it calls &quot;referencevalues.&quot;   For food companies, adding nutritional profiles to theirlabels would be optional because many food packages aren'tlarge enough for them. But it appears likely that a largeshare of the industry would provide the profiles. A surveycommissioned by the National Food Processors Associationshowed a strong consumer preference for a label format with anutritional profile. Of 400 consumers polled, 80% found thenutritional profile of breakfast cereal &quot;very helpful.&quot;   &quot;Consumers should have full access to information thatwill help them make informed choices about the food theyeat,&quot; Dr. Sullivan said here at a food safety and nutritionconference. &quot;Simply put, Americans must be helped, not hypedor hustled, in the supermarket.&quot;   The HHS secretary is in a race with Congress to revamp thenation's food-labeling requirements. Floor action is expectednext month on labeling bills sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman(D., Calif.) and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio). Some inCongress believe that Dr. Sullivan, sensing the politicalappeal of comprehensive food labeling, is trying to steal themarch on lawmakers.   Consumer advocates welcome the competition. &quot;If Congressadopts the legislation this summer, the FDA will be simplyone step ahead in implementing it,&quot; says Bruce Silverglade, alawyer for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, aWashington-based consumer group. &quot;The {parallel} efforts,although competitive politically, are complementary in apractical sense.&quot;   But Dr. Sullivan is running into resistance within theWhite House. Strenuous objections from Richard Darman, theWhite House budget director, thwarted the HHS secretary'splan to publish three new regulations this week in theFederal Register as well as a tentative final rule that woulddefine such terms as &quot;cholesterol free&quot; and &quot;lowcholesterol.&quot;   The snag in the regulations is the volatile issue offederal pre-emption.   The triad of rules, among other things, would requirenutrition labeling on virtually all packaged foods and woulddefine serving size for 159 food categories, ranging fromjelly to breads. Currently, just 61% of the food productsregulated by the FDA carry nutritional labels, many of whichare added voluntarily by manufacturers.   Dr. Sullivan, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter andU.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills say these rules shouldpre-empt state and local labeling laws. They fear that ahodgepodge of labeling requirements would disrupt foodproduction and distribution in the U.S. and impede trade. ButMr. Darman and other White House officials regard federalpre-emption as running counter to the principles offederalism and states' rights embraced by President Bush.They also are sensitive to Mr. Bush's concerns aboutreregulation tendencies in his administration.   Yet to be resolved, administration officials say, iswhether the proposed rules will be silent on federalpre-emption or whether the FDA will seek public comment onthe issue.   The food industry has been adamant on the need forregulatory uniformity. &quot;Make no mistake,&quot; says John Cady,president of the food processors group, &quot;different foodsafety and labeling requirements will impose very substantialadded costs to our national food distribution system.&quot; AddsC. Manly Molpus, president of the Grocery Manufacturers ofAmerica: &quot;When it comes to what diet and health informationgoes on food labels, there can be only one cook in thekitchen.&quot;   But consumer groups oppose federal pre-emption. Theindustry &quot;just wants to preclude more stringent statelabeling requirements,&quot; including freshness dating andorganic-food labeling laws, Mr. Silverglade says.   The thrust of the labeling package is to help consumersmake sense out of a welter of confusing and often conflictingnutritional information as food companies increasingly relyon health claims as a marketing tool. Under currentregulations, nutritional labels are required only when acompany makes a nutritional claim or adds vitamins, mineralsor protein to a product.   Yesterday, Dr. Sullivan said nutritional labeling would berequired on every packaged-food product that is a &quot;meaningfulsource&quot; of nutrients. Food sold by restaurants, bakeries andother small businesses would be exempt from the proposedrule, as would spices and bite-size food, such as mints andpenny candies. Supermarkets would be required to postnutritional information on fruit, vegetables, fish andseafood or distribute booklets to shoppers.   On the top half of a typical label, the FDA would requirefood companies to list the number of calories from fat perserving, as well as the amount of saturated fatty acids,cholesterol and total dietary fiber. Currently, only figuresfor protein, carbohydrates fat and calories are required.   On the bottom half, the agency now requires companies tolist the percentage of recommended daily allowances perserving of eight nutrients: protein, vitamin A, vitamin C,thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium and iron. Under its newrules, the FDA would make the listing of thiamine, riboflavinand niacin optional, and would only require protein on foodsfor infants and young children.   The agency also proposes switching from recommended dailyallowances, or RDAs, to an internationally used term,&quot;reference daily intakes,&quot; or RDIs, for the sake ofuniformity. At the same time, the agency would update theRDIs for protein, 12 vitamins and seven minerals. Inaddition, it would set RDIs for seven other nutrients,including vitamin K, manganese and selenium.</TEXT></DOC>
