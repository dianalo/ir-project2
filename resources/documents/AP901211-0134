Gorbachev has said threaten hisreforms.   ``We welcome the hand offered to us and will not push it away,''presidential spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko said at a briefing Tuesday,according to the state news agency Tass.   More shipments were expected Wednesday and they would bedistributed to Byelorussia, the Ukraine and parts of Russia,Ignatenko said.   The shortages have grown more acute in recent months,exacerbated by distribution problems, black market pilfering andpanic buying, officials have said. An Associated Press survey ofmajor cities across the country indicated shortages were worst inurban areas.   The Baltic republic of Estonia, however, apparently was havingfew problems. Estonian Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar told Sovietofficials Tuesday by telegram that his republic does not need foodaid from the West, the independent Interfax news agency reported.   But it would accept medicine for children and the elderly, hesaid.   Estonia, like the other Baltic republics Latvia and Lithuania,traditionally have been well-off compared to other republicsbecause of their own food resources and proximity to sympatheticScandinavian countries.</TEXT></DOC>
