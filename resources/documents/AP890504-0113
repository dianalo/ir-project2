It recommendedpunishing at least four officers.   Also today, soldiers fatally shot a Palestinian who brokethrough an army roadblock, and Arab assailants gunned down aPalestinian suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities.   In Beirut, a group calling itself Islamic Jihad in Palestineclaimed that one of its members was responsible for the stabbingdeath Wednesday of two elderly Israelis in Jerusalem. Police havesaid the man acted on his own.   The army report resulted from an investigation into the April 13raid by paramilitary Border Police on the West Bank village ofNahalin. In the occupied territories, the Border Police are underarmy command.   Villagers in Nahalin alleged officers fired indiscriminately asresidents emerged from morning prayers.   The officers said they fired after being confronted bystone-throwing villagers. Five people died and at least 18 werewounded.   The investigation said there were ``deficiencies uncovered in... operational planning, briefings and preparations, command andcontrol as well as deviations from regulations, including the useof live fire.''   It called for transferring to other posts the Border Policecommander in charge of the raid and his company commander.   The report also recommended transferring the lieutenant colonelin command of the army's Bethlehem district and reprimanding acolonel in charge of the region. It did not give any names.   The report, approved by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, alsocalled for possible disciplinary steps against two Border Policeofficers.   It urged a police investigation of all troops involved but notedthat in some cases the police faced ``life-threatening situations''that would allow them to fire live ammunition.   Army regulations call for troops to use tear gas and rubber andplastic bullets before resorting to live ammunition to to disperserioters.   But the report said villagers shared responsibility for thebloodshed by inciting violence against troops who were carrying outlegitimate security duties.   In today's clashes, a Palestinian was shot and killed when herefused orders to stop at an army roadblock near the West Bank townof Qalqiliya, a military spokesman said.   And in the West Bank village of Mughayer, assailants shot todeath Tayseer Issa Assad, 28, after accusing him of collaboratingwith Israeli authorities, Arab reports said. The army confirmed theshooting and said it was investigating.   At least 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have died in the17-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip.   Two Israelis were killed Wednesday and three were seriouslyinjured when a Palestinian man shouting ``God is great!'' attackedthem with a knife as they waited at a Jerusalem bus stop.   Islamic Jihad in Palestine released a statement to Western newsagencies today saying the attacker was ``one of our strugglers.''The group also claimed responsibility for an attack at the WailingWall in Jerusalem in October 1986 in which one Israeli was killedand 69 wounded.   But Jerusalem police said the attacker, identified as NidalAbdel Razik Zaloum from the occupied town of El-Bireh, maintainedhe was acting on his own to avenge the arrest and beating of abrother.   In the West Bank, Jewish settlers launched armed patrols inHebron, saying they would fire on stone-throwers in the Arab cityof 79,000 people.   Army orders restrict use of gunfire to life-threateningsituations. ``We will shoot to hit them, not to kill,'' patrolorganizer Aharon Domb told the Jerusalem Post newspaper.   Early this morning in Hebron, 200 residents from the nearbysettlement of Kiryat Arba went on a rampage, smashing Arab cars andthrowing stones at houses, Arab reporters and Israel radio said.   In the West Bank village of Mughayer, assailants shot to deathTayseer Issa Assad, 28, after accusing him of collaborating withIsraeli authorities, Arab reports said. The army confirmed theshooting and said it was investigating.</TEXT></DOC>
