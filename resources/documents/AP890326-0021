Gorbachev said on Sunday theparliamentary election, which offered Soviets a choice ofcandidates in many cases, can ensure democracy while preserving theone-party rule of the communists.   The Soviet president spoke after he and his wife Raisa voted ata gold-and-white building in the Lenin Hills area that houses theNational Associatedion of Soviet Chemists and part of the SemyonovInstitute of Chemical Physics.   They chose between Boris N. Yeltsin, a popular maverick whoGorbachev ousted as Moscow Communist Party chief, and YevgenyBrakov, the director of the giant ZIL automobile factory, for aseat representing Moscow in the new 2,250-member Congress ofPeople's Deputies.   For a second seat, representing their Oktyabr region of Moscow,they chose between two relatively young and lesser-knowncandidates: Ilya Zaslavsky, a 28-year-old scientific worker at theMoscow Textile Institute, and Alexander Krutov, a Soviet televisoncommentator.   Gorbachev wouldn't say for whom he voted in either case. He toldSoviet and foreign correspondents gathered in a cold mist on thesteps of the building that he voted ``for a candidate who wasnominated.''   ``This is a secret ballot,'' he reminded them.   The president said his policies of pressing for more democracyand openness in Soviet society, while not permitting any legalopposition to the Communist Party, are ``the key to opening thepotential of our socialist society, with the purpose of taking intoaccount the various interests of people and harmonizing them on thebasis of consensus or a majority.''   Gorbachev said political pluralism is ``not a panacea forsolving problems and expressing a plurality of opinions.''   Despite calls by some protesters for a multiparty system,Gorbachev said he was confident most Soviets supported his views.   The Communist Party has launched an investigation into chargesthat Yeltsin advocates a multiparty system, which is not permittedunder the law.   Gorbachev said he was satisfied with the election law approvedin December, saying it ``advanced the political thought and socialactivity of people.''   Officials knew when they wrote the law that it would needperfecting and that the experience of the three-month campaignwould help them make corrections, Gorbachev said. But he did notsay what changes he would support.   Gorbachev was not a candidate in Sunday's balloting, havingalready been elected to the new parliament on March 14 as one of100 deputies picked directly by the Communist Party.   Voters elected 1,500 deputies Sunday to represent variousgeographic districts throughout the country. For the first time indecades, Soviets had a choice of candidates for many of the seats.   The other 650 were being chosen from the party, its affiliates,social, professional and trade union organizations.   Gorbachev said he supported competition at all levels of theelection campaign but saw no contradiction in the party'snominating only 100 candidates for 100 seats. He said many morecandidates' names were considered before the nominations wereannounced.</TEXT></DOC>
