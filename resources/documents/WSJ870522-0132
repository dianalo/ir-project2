Luttwak is the most interesting and provocative of the Washington guild of armchair strategists. Armed Services Committee chairmen sit at his feet and codify his recommendations. Governments and defense contractors have made him rich. His writings have been blunt, incisive, witty and often very wrong.    Like the legislators and contractors he services, his dominant, almost myopic concentration has been on the central front of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Middle East.    &quot;Strategy&quot; (Harvard University Press, 283 pages, $20) is more ambitious than his previous works. It aims to &quot;define strategy,&quot; &quot;to uncover the universal logic that conditions all forms of war, as well as the adversarial dealings of nations in peace time.&quot; It fails. Too bad Mr. Luttwak and his blurbists make such obviously unfulfilled millennial claims for the book. In the field of army tactics and land theater strategy, however, it is a useful read for the specialist.    Mr. Luttwak puts forward a logical construct for analyzing military strategy in five vertical levels: technical, tactical, operational, theater and &quot;Grand Strategy.&quot; Such a construct usefully organizes current defense-policy thinking within the European theater. But for larger global strategy it is not nearly as helpful as the simple constructs of Clausewitz and others. Virtually all of the book's historical and current case studies involve Central Europe or the Arab-Israeli conflict. Asia, the Pacific and the Americas are not included.    The bulk of the book is an interesting discussion of the ever-present dimension of paradox in strategy (if you want peace, prepare for war). He reviews the tactical and theater lessons from past wars in Central Europe, and he evaluates the disagreements now current among those responsible for the defense of the region: precision weapons vs. tanks, the effectiveness of deep interdiction, the employment of tactical nuclear weapons and surprise attack. His conclusions for NATO planners are convincing. His attempt to extrapolate the lessons from the compact chessboard of Europe into eternal principles is not.    The book nicely exposes the NATO addiction to fads: This year for special forces and guerrilla war, last year for deep-strike, the year before for mini-nukes, etc. And it effectively demolishes the myth of &quot;the breakthrough weapon&quot; so beloved by the armchair profession. Mr. Luttwak illustrates that technical innovation yields great advantage to the West, but each advantage is inherently temporary in the action-reaction cycle and, if ill-considered, can result in long-term disadvantage.    The discussion of the role of theater nuclear deterrence (&quot;suasion&quot;) in Europe is particularly good and timely, as are the appendixes on definitions, on the Soviet Army, and on NATO vs Warsaw Pact armies. The last is better than any government net assessment I have seen.    The author's past works have demonstrated a real talent for writing clearly about complexity. But, I suppose, to be published by a university press, one must use big words and lots of them. &quot;Strategy&quot; is written in a stilted and pedantic style that interferes with reading. Thus, the soldier's &quot;hit 'em where they ain't&quot; becomes four pages of multisyllabic prolixity.    The ignorance of and vague hostility to things naval is a common failing of NATO academics. There are no spas or conference centers located near Salamis, Trafalgar or Midway. Whole chapters of &quot;Strategy&quot; are devoted to the battles and lessons of Hitler's defeat in Russia, but the fact that the supply to Russia of all tanks, guns and materiel and the diversion of 40% of the Nazi force uselessly to defend fortress Europe against invasion by sea were both totally dependent on Allied victory at sea is dismissed with the phrase that Russia &quot;. . . obtained much American and British help.&quot; Mr. Luttwak's anti-navy hysteria will cause even his army audience to roll its eyes.    One suspects that the author had a very bad experience with boats as a child. What else explains his obsessive navy-trashing? And not just ours but everybody's. He blames the cause of World War I on the Royal Navy, dismisses the great naval thinker Alfred Thayer Mahan as a &quot;propagandist,&quot; and -- crushingly -- declares there can be no such thing as naval strategy. It is &quot;nonstrategy,&quot; he insists. Mr. Luttwak suggests in a footnote that the money now spent on the U.S. fleet be used instead to subsidize China. This is &quot;Grand Strategy.&quot;    It is Mr. Luttwak's belief that if his new general theory of grand strategy is widely accepted &quot;. . . strategic practice can be freed from the systematically misleading influence of common sense logic.&quot; Inconvenient lessons of history are dismissed with &quot;. . . it has rightly been said that history teaches nothing except that it teaches nothing.&quot; I personally prefer Harry Truman's &quot;The only thing new in the world is the history you don't know.&quot;    Even in its better bits, this book is like the sex education I received from the Jesuits: intellectually brilliant, analytical and useful, but yet lacking that certain wisdom derived from firsthand experience. At its worst, it is both wrong and embarrassingly pretentious.    ---   Mr. Lehman, former secretary of the Navy, is now writing a book. </TEXT></DOC>
