Mr. Danesh, whose Allied Financial Corp. investment firmspecializes in insolvent companies, apparently hopes theinvestment will prevent Southmark's management from sellingoff its troubled real estate assets.</LP><TEXT>   To reach his maximum targets at yesterday's closingprices, Mr. Danesh would spend about $15 million for thecommon stock and $20.5 million for the preferred stock, andwould negotiate a purchase of Southmark notes carrying a facevalue of $75 million.   Whether Southmark assets would prove to be a bargain atthat price is problematical. Federal thrift regulators couldseize Southmark's troubled San Jacinto Savings Association atany moment. Disgruntled limited partners have oustedSouthmark as the general manager of many real estatesyndicates controlled by the Dallas-based real estate andfinancial services concern.   Southmark built its reorganization around San Jacinto. Theremainder of its assets are to be sold in a plan oforganization that went into effect last Friday.   The plan also distributed 43 million common shares to itscreditors, who would then own San Jacinto. The $75 million innotes and $100 million in preferred shares are to be redeemedby sale of Southmark assets.   Mr. Danesh said he disagrees with the plan's strategy.&quot;I'm not interested in selling real estate,&quot; he said. &quot;I'mjust trying to put it back together. I don't like to sellanything.&quot; He said he would work with management rather thanseek control.   Mr. Danesh bought 10.3% of Southmark common shares lastNovember while the company was reorganizing. Thereorganization, plus subsequent sales, reduced his stake toabout one-half of one percent.   New Southmark shares closed yesterday at $1.15625 innational over-the-counter trading on a when-issued basis. Thepreferred shares closed at $5.13.</TEXT></DOC>
