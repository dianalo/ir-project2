This is the fifth pact in nearly three years betweenGeneral Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. topool resources to jointly research and develop generic typesof technology. Other cooperative ventures include researchingautomotive applications for plastic composites, environmentalissues, reformulated fuel and advanced batteries that couldmake electric vehicles more feasible.</LP><TEXT>   Like the earlier cooperative efforts, this one will belimited to basic research. It won't result in sharedproducts, and thus is exempt from antitrust laws.   The latest alliance involves researching serial datalinks, or &quot;multiplexing,&quot; which allow for multiple signals tobe transmitted on one wire. Such systems could allow one wireto carry the same load now handled by several wires.Currently, multiplexing is used to control such vehiclefunctions as lighting, automatic windows and door locks.   But the partnership hopes to delve into complex areasinvolving brake systems and electronic transmissions. It willbe the responsibility of each partner to apply the results ofthe group's research to specific new products, the companiessaid.   By replacing a bunch of single wires with a multiplexingsystem, the companies said they could reduce the weight ofthe car and improve fuel efficiency, simplify production ofwiring systems and make them easier to repair and maintain.</TEXT></DOC>
