SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   From the storm that threatened ChristopherColumbus in 1494 to last year's powerful Gilbert, the death anddestruction wrought by hurricanes have been an intimate part of lifein America.   ``Good God, what horror and destruction,'' wrote a 15-year-oldAlexander Hamilton after experiencing a hurricane in the West Indiesin 1772.   ``The roaring of the sea and wind, fiery meteors flying about inthe air, the prodigious glare of almost perpetual lightning, thecrash of falling houses and the ear-piercing shrieks of thedistressed were sufficient to strike astonishment into angels,''Hamilton reported in a letter to his father.   ``Hurricanes have played an awsome role in the American panorama.They have touched the lives of Americans great and small and, attimes, changed the course of our destiny _ as well as the shape ofour coastline,'' writes Patrick Hughes, managing editor ofWeatherwise magazine.   The deadliest of these massive storms killed 6,000 people,sweeping away much of Galveston, Texas, in 1900. And thousands haveperished in other storms over the years.   Yet one hurricane may have prevented war between the UnitedStates and Germany, another inspired Shakespeare's play, ``TheTempest,'' and a third caused a young planter's daughter to leaveher Caribbean home for France, eventually to wed Napoleon and becomeEmpress Josephine.   Columbus and his crew were probably the first Europeans toencounter a hurricane, sailing through the fringes of one nearHispaniola in 1494 and confronting another at full force near SantoDomingo in 1502.   A weather-wary seaman, Columbus recognized the signs of theapproaching tempest and took his ship into a protected cove to rideout that second storm.   Others refused to heed his warning and set forth for Spain.Twenty ships and 500 men led by Adm. Frencisco de Bobadilla werenever seen again.   In the next few years, both Ponce de Leon and Hermando Corteswere shipwrecked in hurricanes, though both went on to become famousexplorers.   In 1609, the English were seeking to settle the New World, andone small fleet heading for Virginia was overwhelmed by a hurricane.   While many ships limped into Jamestown, the ship Sea Adventurewas feared lost until 10 months later when its passengers and crewarrived in a small boat they had built from the wreckage of theirship.   The Sea Advanture had been driven ashore on Bermuda, an islandunknown to sailors until that event. When the account of theirharrowing voyage and discovery was published in London in 1612 itintrigued William Shakespeare, who was inspired to write the play,``The Tempest.''   It was August 13, 1766, when a hurricane swept over the tinyCaribbean island of Martinique, wiping out the farms of wealthyplanter Joseph-Gaspard Tascher.   With the family facing poverty, one of his daughters, JosephineMarie Rose, returned to France where she met and married anambitious young army officer named Napoleon Bonaparte.   A storm just six years later sent America one of its youngrevolutionaries. Hamilton's letter to his father describing the 1772storm so impressed local planters on the island of St. Croix thatthey took up a collection and sent him to college in America.   Weather historian David M. Ludlum speculates in his book ``TheWeather Factor'' that a hurricane may have prolonged the AmericanRevolution.   British and French fleets were facing off near Rhode Island in1778, with the French upwind and holding the advantage until ahurricane arrived, damaging many ships and scattering the vessels.   Had the French been able to engage and defeat the British, Ludlumsuggests, they might have achieved naval supremacy and thus hastenedthe American vistory.   Another hurricane thousands of miles away and just over a centurylater may have prevented a war.   The 1880s were a time when many nations were establishingcolonial empires, and Germany sought control over several islands inthe Pacific.   In 1888, a German naval task force seeking to take control ofSamoa shelled a native village. Some American property was destroyedand an American flag was torn down by German sailors.   American warships rushed to the scene and naval vessels of thetwo nations faced one another at Apia harbor on March 16, 1889.   But before hostilities could begin, a savage hurricaneoverwhelmed the area, and ships of both nations were wrecked ordriven aground. Sailors from both sides came to one another's aid inthe struggle to survive.   Nearing the present, no hurricane can compare with the toll of6,000 American lives lost when a hurricane driven surge of waterswept over Galveston Island in 1900. Another 1,000 likely diedelsewhere in that storm, though the exact toll may never be known.   Gilbert, in 1988, was perhaps one of the stringest hurricanes ofthis century, though it spent most of its fury in the islands andMexico, claiming only a few lives in Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
