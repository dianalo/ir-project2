The government of President Ramsewak Shankar signed a preliminaryaccord with the warring Jungle Commando in July, despite the army'sobjections that the agreement failed to disarm the guerrillas andcould place too much power in the hands of rebel leader RonnyBrunswijk.   Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse, the armed forces chief who ruled theGeorgia-sized nation on South America's northeast shoulder for sevenyears until elections in November, 1987, says that if the governmentinsists on implementing the agreement, it will do so without thearmy's help.   The outcome of the dispute could help answer a questionSurinamers have long been asking: Who is running the country, thegovernment or the army?   ``The agreement is testing the obedience of the military,''human-rights activist Stanley Rensch said in an interview. ``We arefacing a rather complicated and dangerous situation.''   Since fighting broke out in July, 1986, at least 300 people havebeen killed, dozens of villages destroyed and crucial bauxite andaluminum mining disrupted. An estimated 7,000 Bush Negroes have fledto refugee camps in neighboring French Guiana after repeated raidsby soldiers flushing out guerrilla sympathizers.   The war began as a personal feud between Bouterse, 42, a formerphysical education teacher, and Brunswijk, 28, a Cuban-trainedsoldier who wears dreadlocks and gold chains and once served asBouterse's bodyguard.   Over the years, however, the insurgency assumed politicaldimensions, with Brunswijk, a Bush Negro, demanding democraticreforms, civil rights and economic development for the country's50,000 to 60,000 Bush Negroes.   Bush Negroes, also known as Maroons, the descendants of runawayAfrican slaves, inhabit the rugged eastern interior, where thefighting has been concentrated. Suriname, South America's onlyDutch-speaking country, has a total population of 400,000.   Long-stalled peace talks bore fruit after a period of heightenedtension, culminating in the rebel seizure of Suriname's mainhydroelectric plant June 1. The rebels had threatened to blow up thepower plant and part of Afobaka Dam, flooding the capital ofParamaribo, unless the government agreed to direct negotiations withthe Jungle Commando. The rebels withdrew, however, after 36 hours,on Brunswijk's orders.   After talks June 7-8 on the French Guianese island of Portal, adelegation from Suriname's National Assembly and Brunswijk's JungleCommando reached agreement on a tentative peace proposal. Thegovernment signed the pact July 21 and it was approved by the fullNational Assembly on Aug. 7.   The accord declared the intention of both sides to endhostilities but stopped short of calling for a cease-fire.Nevertheless, only minor skirmishes have been reported since it wassigned.   Among the agreed conditions for a permanent peace are anemergency aid program to rebuild Bush Negro villages, an end to astate of emergency in the eastern part of the country and the returnof refugees to Suriname.   The most contentious issue, however, stipulates that Brunswijk's200 to 300 guerrillas would not have to give up their weapons andwould be transformed into a special security unit to patrol aninterior region comprising two-thirds of the country.   Bouterse says such a force would be unconstitutional, split thenation and make Brunswijk the de facto ruler of the interior.Moreover, the army demands the Jungle Commando be disbanded andforced to turn in its weapons.   ``As long as the Jungle Commando is not brought under the centralauthority of the government, no other arrangements are possible,''Bouterse told reporters recently.   Although Bouterse insists he is not trying to subvert theagreement, his opposition puts the army in direct conflict with agovernment it has never fully trusted.   ``We are feeling like the government is the enemy of the NationalArmy,'' said Maj. Badrissein Sital, commander of the 2,500-man force.   ``Most of the time there is no trust or understanding. Thegovernment uses the excuse that we are a hindrance, but the truth isthey are incapable of dealing with day-to-day problems.''   Brunswijk's supporters say making the Jungle Commando a policeunit would give the rebels, the main inhabitants in the interior, achance to participate in the development of the region.   ``Ronny asks only that they be given a job ... the task ofattending to peace and development in the interior,'' said OjerdaVon Dooren, a Franciscan nun close to Brunswijk.   But Sital said such a force would mean ``the country will bepractically separated in different sections. We can't deal withthat.''   ``We can't negotiate with terrorists and we've always referred toBrunswijk as that,'' the army chief said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs Aug. 30</NOTE></DOC>
