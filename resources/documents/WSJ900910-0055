U.S. and Canadian agriculture officials, as part ofefforts to increase free trade, have agreed to suspend thechecks for contamination in a one-year test of an &quot;openborder&quot; concept. But meat inspectors on both sides contendthe plan will undercut consumer protection against filthyfood and misbranded products. &quot;We aren't shipping furnitureor shoes back and forth; we're dealing with perishablefoods,&quot; says Frederick Coates, the union presidentrepresenting Canada's food inspectors. &quot;With this open-bordercrossing, all control will be lost.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In the U.S., political opposition to the plan is buildingin Congress. The Senate will consider legislation to ensurecontinued spot-checks of Canadian shipments. &quot;Reducing tradedistortions at the border doesn't mean that the U.S.government should throw up its hands and walk away from thatborder,&quot; says Rep. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat whoheads the Senate Agriculture Committee.   Currently, meat and poultry exports are inspected atslaughterhouses and processing plants in both nations, andthen randomly &quot;re-inspected&quot; at the border or at theirdestinations. Under the bilateral plan, the U.S. would relyon Canadian meat inspectors to protect Americans from foodpoisoning and product mislabeling, and Canada would trust inU.S. inspectors.   U.S. and Canadian officials express full confidence ineach other's meat-inspection practices. But Democratic Sen.Tom Daschle of South Dakota declared at a hearing recently onthe open-border proposal: &quot;This is one of the biggestexamples of blind faith I've ever seen.&quot;   Meat and poultry products account for a large part ofnearly $6 billion a year in U.S.-Canada trade in agriculturalcommodities. The U.S. Agriculture Department says only 1% of704 million pounds of all Canadian meat and poultry productswere rejected last year at the border. Meanwhile, only 1.3%of the 317 million pounds of U.S. products going north werefound to be unfit for consumption or improperly labeled,according to Agriculture Canada.   But inspectors on both sides of the border contend thosefigures are misleading. What really counts is the rejectionrate of the meat that was actually inspected, says WilliamLehman, a U.S. border inspector at Sweet Grass, Mont. On May11, he says he turned back 36% of the Canadian meat hechecked. On May 18, it was 14%, and the next day 22%, hesays.   &quot;I found fecal material, blood clots, hair, bruises, greenpus-filled abscesses that should have been obvious to peoplepreparing the product,&quot; says Mr. Lehman.   In Pembina, N.D., inspector Thomas Grube says he, too, hashad similar days. Last year, he refused entry to 9.6% of thetruckloads that had been randomly selected by computer forinspection. Much of the rejected meat was unskinned hams.&quot;Statistically, it tells me 10% of the product that we don'thave an opportunity to look at should be refused.&quot;   &quot;This open-border Mickey Mouse hasn't started yet, but theproduct is already going downhill,&quot; an inspector in Blaine,Wash., Lester Wagner, says of ham shipped by some Canadianpackers. &quot;They've got it pumped so full of liquid it squisheswhen you squeeze it. The crazy thing feels like a sponge.&quot;   At the same time, Canadian inspectors say they have beencatching trucks carrying U.S. beef mixed in with shipments ofphotocopying chemicals and other &quot;incompatible&quot; freight.   This summer, just as the Agriculture Department begantaking formal comments from the public on the one-yearexperiment, it had to oversee a nationwide recall of 22,000pounds of Canadian frankfurters. U.S. inspectors at theBuffalo border post had detected listeria, a sometimes deadlystrain of bacteria, in franks made by J.M. Schneider Inc.,Kitchener, Ontario. State health officials have beeninvestigating reports of illness in New York and elsewhere.   Under the open-border plan, the same inspectors who caughtthe tainted franks would be taken off border duty. ButCanadian and U.S. officials insist there is nothingextraordinary about the recall and that both nations havestrong inspection programs. &quot;Their inspection is equivalentto ours,&quot; says Lester Crawford, director of the U.S.Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.   &quot;You very seldom get food poisoning in the U.S. It's thesame in Canada. What's so magic about the border?&quot; says AndreGravel, director of Agriculture Canada's meat and poultryproducts division.   Despite a recent Free Trade Agreement between the U.S. andCanada, border inspections remain a serious irritant inbilateral relations. Canadian exporters have long complainedabout harassment by overzealous U.S. inspectors. The Bushadministration is predisposed to remedy the problem. One ofits main objectives is global &quot;harmonization&quot; of sanitarystandards, including food-safety regulations, to reduceimpediments to trade. The result: On Feb. 26, AgricultureSecretary Clayton Yeutter agreed to undertake the open-borderexperiment with Canada.   &quot;We want to have reciprocal inspection, if we can work itout,&quot; says the department's Mr. Crawford. &quot;We hope to open upa lot of borders. This experiment . . . could be applied toother countries.&quot;   Auditors for the General Accounting Office, the audit armof Congress, however, found that the department has verylittle documented evidence to prove that Canada's inspectionsystem is as strict or effective as its own.   Yielding to pressure from Congress, the AgricultureDepartment just gave consumers and others an additional 30days (until Sept. 5) to comment on the plan. Caught in themiddle of the fracas -- and fearful of the public-relationsfallout -- are meat producers, packers and processors on bothsides of the border.   U.S. meatpackers fear U.S. consumers won't be abledistinguish between U.S. and Canadian products at thesupermarket and &quot;will become suspicious of all meat,&quot; saysMark Ulven, an aide to Sen. Daschle. But some U.S. inspectorssay they don't think Canadian products coming in arenecessarily any worse than U.S. products going north.   The American Meat Institute and the Canadian Meat Councilare calling for a bilateral panel of government, industry,and consumer representatives to monitor the one-yearexperiment. &quot;In theory, the proposal sounds good, but we'regoing to have to look at it very closely,&quot; says Thomas Cook,Washington lobbyist for the National Cattlemen's Association.   Agriculture Canada's Mr. Gravel believes the concerns willeventually be resolved. &quot;We have bad operators and the U.S.has bad operators,&quot; he says. &quot;It's a matter of making surethese bad guys are caught. Sooner or later, we're going tocatch them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
