The crackdown that began in 1986 already has resulted in severalwell-publicized cases of insider trading and other securities abuse.   But the stock market crash unveiled a new breed of manipulators,according to authorities who on Thursday described the case ofStanley Aslanian Jr., 29, former president of a now-defunctsecurities firm, the Haas Securities Corp.   Stocks pushed by the company surged during the Oct. 19, 1987crash, but then the company faltered and the investigation beganonce ``Haas went out of business nine days'' after the crash ascustomers complained, Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Lieb said.   Now, officials say he has promised federal investigators he willassist their probe of his firm's actions.   ``The heady days of pre-Oct. 19 gave birth to this case,'' hislawyer, Kalman Gallop said. ``It is probably one of 1,000 tragediesfrom that day.''   The stock manipulation undertaken by the 75-year-old company with12,000 customers and four offices nationwide is indicative ofsimilar problems in the industry, authorities said.   ``We have seen a proliferation of these kinds of activities sincethe crash,'' James C. Esposito, an assistant deputy director of theFBI, said at a news conference at U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani'sManhattan office.   Most of the notable securities cases have stemmed from theinsider trading scandal that started with the guilty plea of DennisB. Levine in 1986.   The new investigation by the FBI, Securities and ExchangeCommission and the U.S. attorney's office begins with Aslanian, whowas expected to plead guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan toone count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud by manipulatingstock, Giuliani said.   The defendant faces up to five years in prison and $250,000 infines.   Giuliani said he hoped Aslanian's deal would ``encourage othersto do what Mr. Aslanian did. It's a very significant and helpfulthing to do.''   Haas Securities went out of business Oct. 28, 1987, afterAslanian was involved in manipulating millions of dollars worth ofstocks, officials said.   Gallop said Haas Securities is now in Chapter 7 liquidationproceedings in Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.   Gallop said ``millions and millions of dollars'' were involvedbut profits could not be easily determined. Aslanian declined tocomment.   Lieb said the case involved the manipulation of four stocks: TSIndustries from the Salt Lake City area; Big O Tires; Flores de NewMexico and Cliff Engle Ltd.   The information alleges that the scheme lasted from June 1985until November 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
