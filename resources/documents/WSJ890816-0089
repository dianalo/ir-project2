Under the plan, a sort of reorganization outside of bankruptcy court, senior creditors might get only 70 cents on the dollar while common shareholders would get almost nothing.    This last-ditch restructuring attempt of the troubled financial services and real estate concern would essentially involve breaking up the company and liquidating much of its business to pay creditors, who hold $2 billion in claims.    Even if Integrated can avoid a bankruptcy-law filing, which many creditors doubt, it might have to sell its valuable insurance units and other properties at fire-sale prices, some Integrated holders say.    Under the proposed plan, Integrated would put its insurance and mutual-fund units into a separate company that would be sold or turned over to senior creditors. Its limited partnerships, also in a separate company, would be liquidated over time.    Arthur Goldberg, the company's co-chief executive officer, said &quot;it was not an easy decision&quot; to propose splitting up and selling pieces of Integrated, a once highflying real estate syndicator that was financed with junk securities. But the proposed asset sales are necessary because of the &quot;deterioration in values&quot; caused by the company's liquidity crisis and other problems, he said.    Integrated presented its new restructuring proposal to a creditors' meeting in New York and expects to file documents on its plan with the Securities and Exchange Commission after Labor Day.    Separately, Integrated announced that two directors, David R. Markin and Allan R. Tessler, resigned Monday. Integrated hasn't lined up a buyer for its insurance businesses, Mr. Goldberg says, but has started serious talks with several parties. Robert Bass, Kaufman andamp; Broad and some Bronfman family members are rumored to be interested in parts of Integrated. Meanwhile, Integrated hopes to sell its stake in American Real Estate Partners for more than $35 million.    The new restructuring plan shows how rapidly Integrated's operations have eroded since it first defaulted in June on almost $1 billion of short-term debt.    According to Mr. Goldberg, the financial overhaul now being contemplated might produce about $1 billion of value for creditors. But that falls far short of total claims amounting to $2 billion that are held by creditors and preferred shareholders.    At the creditor meeting, said one bondholder, Integrated disclosed that annuity sales had fallen to about $13 million a week from $20 million before the liquidity crunch. Meanwhile, terminations climbed to $34 million a week from $7 million.    Partly because it has had to write down its asset values, Integrated expects to report a $600 million loss for the second quarter. &quot;You learn about the company's assets as they write them off,&quot; joked one Integrated bondholder.    Less than two months ago, Integrated's longtime investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. proposed a much more optimistic restructuring. It valued the company's assets at about $1.8 billion and envisaged that Integrated would keep operating as a going concern. Some people think Drexel, after scrutinizing Integrated's businesses, found far less value than it expected.    But Stephen Weinroth, a senior Drexel officer who is now Integrated's co-chief executive, says the 30% write-down of asset values reflects the fact that &quot;you're not likely to get the best bids in the world when you're liquidating assets quicker than you expected.&quot; He adds, &quot;You want to project conservative numbers,&quot; so as not to get people's hopes up.    Creditors' mood during the meeting was relatively pessimistic, and the gossip was about big losses sustained on Integrated securities. &quot;Ugly, ugly, ugly,&quot; said one short-seller.    All Integrated securities got clobbered yesterday. Its common shares fell 75 cents, or 27%, to close at $2, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Some of its preferred shares had losses of about 35% to 50%. Its junk bonds dived several points, with some junior debt securities trading at only 14 cents on the dollar.    Creditors seem to fear above all that a bankruptcy-law filing would mean further deterioration in Integrated's businesses, leaving even less for creditors. At the same time, they worry that Integrated might have trouble reconciling its diverse senior and junior lenders.    &quot;There are an awful lot of people that can pull the trigger,&quot; precipitating a bankruptcy-law filing, says William Jacobs of Prudential-Bache Capital, an Integrated bondholder who attended the meeting. He thinks Integrated will wind up in bankruptcy court. For senior and junior creditors at this point, he says, &quot;The only question is how much cash will they get, and when?&quot;    Besides defaulting on its short-term debt, Integrated in recent months has missed payments on two of its bond issues.    Usually, all creditors must agree on a restructuring plan. But Mr. Weinroth says that as an alternative, Integrated could seek what's called a &quot;prepackaged bankruptcy,&quot; which wouldn't require 100% creditor approval. It would file for bankruptcy-law protection, telling the judge it had significant creditor support for its plan. The whole process might be completed in 30 to 60 days, he says.    A big holder of Integrated preferred says he's disappointed in the new restructuring plan. He says Integrated's board should have brought in an experienced financial services executive to run the business and create some stability. Some dissident Integrated directors recently tried to do that but were voted down.    While Integrated's earlier restructuring plan would also have asked creditors to forgive some debts, their &quot;haircut&quot; would not have been nearly as drastic as under the current proposal.    A person close to Integrated estimates that the company's senior creditors -- commercial banks, short-term commercial paper holders and senior bondholders -- might come out with &quot;better than 70 cents on the dollar&quot;; holders of Integrated's more speculative junk might get half as much, while preferred shareholders might get about 10 cents. &quot;The preferreds would be murdered,&quot; this person concedes. Common shareholders would get a small stake in some real estate partnerships, he says.    The process of making partial payments to lenders might take anywhere from a few months to several years, he adds. &quot;You have to leave me some latitude as to the timing&quot; of such payments, he says, adding that the process might take even longer in a bankruptcy court.    The current plan is to sell Integrated's insurance and mutual-fund units together with the company's big sales force. But if Integrated cannot fetch at least $450 million, this entity would be turned over to senior creditors. They would have to operate or sell the entity. According to Integrated, most of the $600 million decline in the company's asset values in the past two months is attributable to its insurance units.    However, one Integrated bondholder worries that if the insurance units aren't sold soon, they might be taken over by regulators and liquidated to pay policyholders. Insurance regulators have apparently placed certain restrictions on Integrated's insurance units. Holders of Integrated policies would rank senior to bank lenders in a liquidation, the investor says.    The company values its real estate and other partnerships at about $700 million. All creditors and preferred shareholders would get a stake, in the form of debt and equity, in this entity. The current plan is gradually to liquidate the partnerships, though Mr. Goldberg says, &quot;I have some hope that they can be revitalized.&quot;    But the big question, says Paul Debban of Seidler Amdec Securities, is just what value Integrated's partnership assets have. &quot;And will you get more if you force them into Chapter 11?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
