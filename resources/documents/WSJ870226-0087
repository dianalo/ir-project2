The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati upheld a lower court ruling that barred Milford, Ohio-based Buckhorn, a maker of plastic containers, from implementing a &quot;poison pill&quot; shareholder rights plan and other measures. The company had asked the court to rule before midnight tomorrow, when the offer is set to expire.    Ropak, a Fullerton, Calif.-based maker and distributor of plastic shipping containers, launched its $17 million offer to acquire Buckhorn last November.    Larry Martin, Buckhorn senior vice president and treasurer, said that the ruling &quot;invalidated the existing plan (but) doesn't preclude future efforts&quot; to thwart the takeover, and that the company will make an announcement today concerning such efforts. He said the courts' rulings have supported Buckhorn's contention that the offer is inadequate.    A Ropak spokesman said he couldn't comment on takeover defenses not yet announced. </TEXT></DOC>
