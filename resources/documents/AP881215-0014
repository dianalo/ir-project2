(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker expressed concernWednesday that his former evangelistic empire would vanish, butofficials of PTL's successor group continued negotiating with theirnew landlord to salvage some part of the ministry.   The fate of the television ministry and church at Fort Mill,S.C., was left up in the air Tuesday when Stephen Mernick, a34-year-old Orthodox Jew, purchased the PTL assets for $65 million.Since last year, the facilities have been leased to HeritageMinistries, a non-profit religious group created by the bankruptcycourt.   In a statement Wednesday, Bakker, accused in a federal indictmentwith misusing millions of dollars of his followers' money, said hewas concerned that Mernick would ignore the rights of PTL'sso-called lifetime partners who contributed $1,000 or more to theministry in exchange for free lodging at Heritage USA, PTL's lavishreligious theme park at Fort Mill.   ``Our hearts are broken over the fighting over Heritage USA thatwas built to bring people together in God's love,'' Bakker said.``Tammy and I still have as our goal to restore Heritage USA and alllifetime benefits to the partners who built it.''   But Heritage Ministries President Sam Johnson, who has met withMernick three times since Monday, said Wednesday that he expects noimmediate changes.   ``He (Mernick) was very conciliatory in his tone,'' said Johnson,who also is pastor of the church.   ``The ministry is the heart and soul of Heritage USA,'' he said.``When you take out the heart, all you have is a cadaver.''   Heritage Ministries officials told viewers of Wednesday'sbroadcast of ``Heritage Today,'' the successor to the ``PTL Club,''they would continue in their effort to buy all the assets of PTL.   ``We want to be prepared in any event,'' said Johnson, explainingthat a number of developments could occur before the deal was final.``Some assets he (Mernick) may not be interested in.''   Meanwhile Wednesday, an attorney for one of the unsuccessfulbidders for PTL, Charlotte broadcasting executive Cy Bahakel, saidhis client will fight the sale in court.   ``We are going to contest irregularities in these proceedings,and we are very firm in our intention to do that,'' said the lawyer,Faison Barnes.   Tuesday, in bankruptcy court in Columbia, Mernick raised hisoffer to $65 million, after being the high bidder at $36.25 millionat an auction the previous day. Reynolds then accepted the offer.   When Bahakel, who showed up about 25 minutes late, asked to beallowed to bid $70 million, Reynolds turned him down. Bahakel'slawyer said Wednesday that Mernick should not have been allowed toraise his bid.   Johnson indicated that the money the group raised in anunsuccessful telethon effort to buy PTL _ reportedly about $5million _ may be used to buy the assets it needs to maintain theministry.   Mernick would not answer questions Tuesday about the future ofHeritage Ministries, but said he would unveil plans in the next twoweeks for PTL's assets, which include the satellite network carriedon 800 cable systems, 1,700 acres of undeveloped land, a 500-roomhotel, a water park, and the 2,000-seat church.   When he entered the PTL bidding in October, Mernick said he wasinterested in the assets ``purely as a real estate deal.''   The Charlotte Observer, quoting sources close to Mernick, said heintends to hold onto the undeveloped land for 10 years as its valuerises.   Johnson said Mernick told officials of Heritage Ministries he isinterested in maintaining the retreat's atmosphere.   ``He's extremely sensitive to the people who have invested,''Johnson said.   Meanwhile, Bakker faces a bond hearing Thursday on the indictmentissued last week.   Jim Toms, one of the PTL founder's attorneys, said he does notexpect his client to enter a plea until next month. Toms has saidpreviously that Bakker would plead innocent to all charges.   A federal grand jury on Dec. 5 indicted Bakker and his former topdeputy at PTL, Richard Dortch, on 24 counts of wire and mail fraudand conspiracy. The panel has accused Bakker and Dortch of divertingmore than $4 million in PTL money to support their own ``lavish andextravagant'' lifestyles.   Two other former aides, brothers David and James Taggart, eachwere indicted on six tax charges.   Bakker, 48, resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after it wasrevealed he had a sexual tryst in 1980 with New York churchsecretary Jessica Hahn and paid her to keep quiet about it.</TEXT></DOC>
