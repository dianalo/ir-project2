Striking members of the United Transportation Union blamed the walkout on unsafe conditions. But F. Colin Pease, a vice president of Guilford, said the union is protesting the company's recent attempts to make significant improvements in labor productivity.    Although North Billerica, Mass.-based Guilford operates mainly in New England and is closely held, it has become a pioneer on labor issues. It has launched a campaign to confront the railroad industry's archaic, inefficient work practices and to change federal laws that perpetuate them.    When track workers struck Guilford in March 1986, the railroad assigned supervisors and nonunion employees to run trains with smaller crews and without expensive work rules. President Reagan two months later created an emergency board to look into the strike, but Congress imposed a settlement favorable to labor.    Guilford has since made other efficiency moves. Despite fierce opposition from labor, it has transferred much of its system to Springfield Terminal, a small Guilford subsidiary in Springfield, Vt., which employs members of the United Transportation Union but has flexible work rules and lower wages.    Fred Hardin, president of the United Transportation Union, said the 1,200 striking workers protested Springfield Terminal's &quot;absolute disregard for safety.&quot; For example, Mr. Hardin said a failed brake on a freight car caused an accident last week in Lawrence, Mass., that killed a conductor.    John Riley, head of the Federal Railroad Administration, said that allegations about safety violations often accompany labor disputes based on economics. &quot;But that doesn't mean the claims are unfounded,&quot; he said.    The agency is investigating an accident yesterday that was caused when six Guilford locomotives broke loose and traveled unmanned for 35 miles before colliding with a string of boxcars in Deerfield, Mass. There were no injuries. Although management has blamed vandalism, the union charged that management failed to properly secure the locomotives. </TEXT></DOC>
