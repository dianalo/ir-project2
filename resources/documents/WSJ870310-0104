The agency attributed the U.S. statistical flaw to a growing tendency of U.S. truckers not to file export declarations with U.S. customs when they cross the border into Canada. The truckers are obliged, however, to stop for Canadian customs and record their cargo.    Ivan Fellegi, chief statistician at Statistics Canada, said that if Canadian figures of U.S.-Canada trade for 1986 are correct, about 7% of the total reported trade deficit of the U.S. &quot;could be wiped off with the stroke of a pen.&quot; The U.S. Commerce Department last month reported a 1986 trade deficit of $169.78 billion, an annual record.    Mr. Fellegi said only 45% of U.S. exports of fruit and vegetables to Canada are showing up in U.S. export data. Much of this produce moves to Canada in trucks from Florida and California. Other products that are significantly underreported in U.S. exports include rubber and plastics, iron and steel and transportation equipment.    The underreporting problem has grown since the deregulation of the U.S. trucking industry, which prompted many small trucking companies to become involved in U.S.-Canada trade. Many of these small firms aren't familiar with U.S. export procedures, and U.S. customs offices haven't been enforcing the requirement that export declarations be filed, a U.S. Commerce Department spokesman said in Washington.    Senior officials of the U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics Canada and the customs departments of the two countries plan to meet in Washington Friday to discuss ways of dealing with the problem. Mr. Fellegi said the solution may be for the two countries to exchange their import data and use that information for computing their exports. Imports of each country are much better reported than exports because imports are a source of revenue through duties.    The U.S. Commerce Department reported a 1986 U.S. deficit of $23.3 billion in trade with Canada. Statistics Canada reported a 1986 Canadian surplus in trade with the U.S. equivalent in U.S. dollars to about $11.3 billion. The difference between these figures is the overstatement of the U.S. trade deficit cited by Canada.    Since 1971 officials of the two countries have done annual reconciliations of their trade statistics to produce a mutually acceptable set of figures on their commerce, which is the largest between any two countries in the world.    Mr. Fellegi said the underreporting of U.S. exports distorted the direction as well as the level of U.S. shipments to Canada. While the U.S. figures show U.S. exports to Canada declining 2.5% in 1986 from the previous year, Canadian records show its imports from the U.S. rising 4.4% in 1986.    The U.S. Commerce Department official said the department has launched an education program to make exporters aware of the export declaration requirement. </TEXT></DOC>
