The Kingdom's shores thereforeconstitute a significant part of the coastlines of both sea areas. &quot;RegionalSeas&quot; programs have been developed for both areas. In the case of theArabian Gulf, the &quot;Action Plan&quot; and the service organization - the RegionalOrganization for the Protection of the Marine Environment (ROPME) - werea product of rising concern for the rapidly deteriorating marine environmentas a result of recent development following the discovery of the largeoil reserves found the Gulf more than forty years ago. ROPME representsmost of the nations on the Arabian Gulf. In marked contrast to the ArabianGulf, the Red Sea is still largely unaffected by industrial development.Awareness of the relatively natural condition of the Red Sea and itsoutstanding value as a regional resource lead to the establishment ofthe Regional Convention for the Conservation of the Red Sea and the Gulfof Aden by the countries sharing the shores of this region. Saudi Arabiahas played a major role in the development of both regional seas programsand is also committed to a national program for the conservation of itsown resources. This paper addresses action being taken for the Red Seawithin the Kingdom.</TEXT></DOC>
