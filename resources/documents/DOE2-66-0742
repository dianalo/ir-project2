<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-66-0742 </DOCNO><TEXT>The results of large eddy simulation (LES) of the Navier--Stokes equationsare used to evaluate the validity of Taylor's hypothesis of frozen turbulence,which states that the time derivative of some instantaneous quantityis proportional to its derivative in the streamwise direction, for incompressibleplane channel flow. Time and space derivatives in the streamwise directionof the velocity components are, in fact, found to be well correlated.Root-mean-square fluctuations of the terms in Taylor's hypothesis alsosupport the validity of this hypothesis above the buffer layer. The goodagreement between LES and experimental results indicates that errorsin the evaluation of derivatives in the streamwise direction are duemostly to insufficient resolution.</TEXT></DOC>
