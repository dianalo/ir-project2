Manuel Antonio Noriega.   The move has given hope to his opponents, with one oppositionleader saying pressure by the Organization of American States couldhelp topple Noriega by sparking ``an explosion from within'' themilitary.   The OAS action Wednesday to condemn Noriega was an importantvictory for the new Bush administration, which inherited formerPresident Reagan's yearlong confrontation with the tough Panamaniandespot who the U.S. government accuses of drug trafficking andpolitical repression.   It is no longer a fight between the northern giant and Noriega,but between Noriega and his peers, who now consider him a problemafter he threw out the results of the May 7 presidential electionswidely believed won by the opposition.   In a quick maneuver Wednesday, the United States squeezed aresolution out of the OAS condemning Noriega for causing thecurrent political crisis and practically telling him he mustrecognize the opposition's electoral victory.   Foreign ministers from three Latin American countries are tovisit Panama next week to promote conciliation and a nationalaccord to bring about ``a transfer of power in the shortestpossible time.''   In diplomatic terms, they are making the general an offer theyknow he cannot accept and forcing him to face the alternative _diplomatic and political sanctions.   The sanctions would mean almost total isolation from other Latincountries and most likely additional economic sanctions by theUnited States. They could also mean credit restrictions and otherfinancial curtailments from European and Asian countries alreadyupset by the heavy-handed way the government annulled an election.   Noriega says he has become a target of U.S. wrath because heopposes alleged U.S. designs to maintain control of the PanamaCanal and to keep its military installations in Panama beyond theyear 2000.   Internally, Noriega has little to worry about from an oppositionthat, although powerful in votes, does not have the resources orwill to rebel against a general who retains the loyalty of thePanamanian Defense Forces, a well-trained and disciplinedorganization of 15,000.   Opposition vice presidential candidate Ricardo Arias admitteddomestic opposition could not oust Noriega. But he expressed hopethat actions such as the OAS resolution would help ``increase thepressure and create the atmosphere that would result in anexplosion from within.''   He was referring to the opposition's hopes for a coup d'etat bydisaffected members of the military.   The United States has done its share to create the``atmosphere'' by sending 1,900 soldiers to beef up Panama Canalsecurity and protect ``U.S. lives, interests and property.'' Italso evacuated U.S. dependents from Panama, thus removing millionsof dollars from the local economy.   The Roman Catholic Church, which also opposes Noriega andcriticized the annullment of the elections, expressed hopes the OASaction would help solve the problem.   ``The expression of the OAS will not solve our problems, but itmay lead to the circumstances in which it is easier to solvethem,'' said Panama Archibishop Marcos McGrath.   But the general still has at least two options.   He can call for the formation of a constituent assembly togovern Panama after Sept. 1, when the current government's termends, or he can negotiate with the opposition and perhaps try todivide it.   Some Noreiga supporters already are asking for talks with theopposition.   Some Latin American sources admitted privately they were nothappy with the OAS resolution, which they said could be considered``interventionist.'' One of the organization's principles prohibitsmeddling in members' affairs.   But for now, the U.S. can stop being the big bully and let itsOAS partners carry on the fight against the Panamanian strongman.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Eloy O.
