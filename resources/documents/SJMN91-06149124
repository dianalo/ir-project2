The appeals court said a new trial must beheld -- or the case dismissed -- if any of the evidence was tainted.;    Walshappealed to the Supreme Court.;    &quot;We are of course disappointed that theSupreme Court would not take the North case at this time,&quot; Walsh said.;    Hesaid his office was ready to go ahead with the &quot;item by item&quot; review ofevidence ordered by the appeals court. The hearing will be held before U.S.District Judge Gerhard Gesell, who presided over North's trial.;    &quot;I have nocomment,&quot; said Barry Simon, one of North's attorneys. &quot;We haven't had commentsfor 4 1/2 years.&quot;;    North was convicted of misleading Congress in itsinvestigation of the Iran-Contra affair, accepting an illegal gift andunlawfully shredding sensitive government documents. Only the first twoconvictions were at issue in the appeal the high court acted on today.;    TheSupreme Court also rejected, without comment, an appeal by North challenginghis prosecution on other grounds.;    The outcome of North's case also likelywill affect the prosecution of former national security adviser JohnPoindexter, North's boss, who was convicted in 1990 of five felonies.;   Poindexter also gave immunized testimony to Congress, and has appealed hisconviction.;    The Iran-Contra affair became public knowledge in 1986 when itwas revealed that the Reagan administration secretly sold weapons to Iran andused proceeds to help the Contras, the rebel forces fighting in Nicaragua.;   Congress granted North immunity and ordered him to testify at hearings on theIran-Contra affair. Nothing he said at the hearings could be used against himin criminal proceedings.;    North was convicted May 4, 1989, on three of 12criminal counts against him. He was sentenced to 1,200 hours of communityservice, which he has completed, and was fined $150,000.;    The appealscourt, in a 2-1 ruling last July, temporarily set aside North's convictionsfor accepting the gift and for misleading Congress.;    The charge that Northmisled Congress stems from a chronology of the Iran-Contra affair he helpedprepare for Reagan administration officials who were about to testify in thecongressional investigation.;    He was convicted of taking an illegalgratuity for accepting a $13,800 home security system from Richard Secord, aformer Air Force major general and businessman enlisted by North to airliftarms to the Contras.;    The two judges on the appeals court panel who votedto set aside North's convictions, David Sentelle and Laurence Silberman, wereappointed by former President Reagan. The dissenting panel member, PatriciaWald, was named to the appeals court by former President Carter.;    In hisSupreme Court appeal, Walsh said a great deal more was at stake in the casethan North's conviction.;    If the appeals court ruling is allowed to stand,Walsh said, it could threaten future prosecutions in high-profile cases thatprompt congressional inquiries.;    As with the Iran-Contra affair, politicalrealities and public demands for action spur Congress to investigate beforecriminal prosecutions are completed.;    The appeals court ruling &quot;will have asubstantial chilling effect on the use of immunity orders to furthercongressional inquiries,&quot; Walsh said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910528  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  632  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday May 28, 199100149124,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
