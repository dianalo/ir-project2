In April 1983, the TexasDepartment of Water Resources investigated the site because of the potentialthreat to local residents of waste pesticides left by applicating companiesno longer in operation. Surficial soil at the site was found to be highlycontaminated with pesticides. In October 1983, an Immediate Removal Action,initiated by the U.S. EPA, consolidated 40 cu. yds of waste and 50-70drums in two onsite disposal cells. In May 1984, a second removal actiondisposed of 19 drums offsite and secured the site with a fence.
