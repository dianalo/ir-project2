There isno evidence to support that, none at all,'' he said, citing data byhis campaign pollster, Robert Teeter, showing the issue of abortionranked between ninth and 14th on the list of what voters considermost important.   Bush said he had ``no intention of changing my position'' onabortion.   The president opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incestor endangerment to the mother's life. He opposes federal money tofund abortions for poor women.   ``Abortion divides,'' said Bush, acknowledging the volatileatmosphere on abortion since the Supreme Court gave statesincreased power to restrict it this year.   ``Is it the most important issue for me? Absolutely not,'' hesaid   Bush recently vetoed a $157.6 billion funding package for thedepartments of Education, Labor and Health and Human Servicesbecause of abortion-funding provisions.   ``It's just so personal,'' he said. ``I just come down more onthe side of life. ... I don't fault people who view thisdifferently. There's plenty of room for difference.''</TEXT></DOC>
