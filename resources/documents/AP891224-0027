ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The name doesn't matter. Any Democraticheavyweight will do: They're all professing no interest whatsoeverin taking on President Bush in 1992.   ``I have no plans to run for president in 1992,'' declares Sen.Sam Nunn of Georgia.   ``I'm focusing on my re-election next year,'' says Sen. Al Goreof Tennessee.   ``I'm not running and I'm not making any plans to run,'' chimesin Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.   Ditto for Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gov. Mario Cuomo ofNew York and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.   So is it Bush and Quayle unopposed for re-election in 1992?   No chance.   While there is remarkably little overt activity among thepotential Democratic challengers, there is always somethingstirring in presidential politics. Even those who deny any interestfind their hearts beat a little faster when they breathe the cool,clean air of Iowa and New Hampshire.   Bradley was in Des Moines over the summer to speak at afund-raiser for Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who faces a toughRepublican challenge in 1990. While he was there, he met with TonyBisignano, a union official and state legislator.   Bisignano was impressed.   He said they didn't talk about 1992, but he'd be eager to starta ``low-key, grassroots organization'' to drum up support forBradley.   Bentsen, meanwhile, was the featured speaker at the IowaDemocratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner this fall.   New Hampshire, the state which has the quadrennial distinctionof holding the first presidential primary, has had visits in 1989from Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado and Gov. Richard Celeste ofOhio. Both came close to entering the 1988 presidential race.   Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska had a long lunch in Boston thisfall with a group of political operatives who have had extensiveexperience in Democratic presidential campaigns.   ``He just wanted to know what was on people's minds,'' saidLarry Rasky, a public relations executive who worked on Sen. JoeBiden's 1988 campaign.   Cuomo has said an indication that he is planning a presidentialbid would be an announcement that he will not run for a third termas governor of New York. He's not giving that signal, at least notnow.   In a telephone interview, he said he's leaning toward anothergubernatorial campaign.   ``There's just nothing I can do that's as important as this,''he said.   But somehow, Cuomo finds it impossible to stop thinking aboutrunning for president.   An example of his ambivalence came last summer when he invited areporter to ask him about the possibility that he might seek thepresidency.   ``I want to talk about it, because I want to dispose of it,'' hesaid, declaring that he was tired of speculation about his plans.   ``And so,'' he said, ``for the time being I'm not going todiscuss it.''</TEXT></DOC>
