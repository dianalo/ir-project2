The host and ranch owner, Connie C. &quot;Chip&quot; Armstrong Jr.,was celebrating a personal kind of independence day: Hisfather had just completed an 18-month jail term forlaundering drug money.</LP><TEXT>   The extravaganza was noteworthy, even by the standards ofTexas' bygone oil-boom days, because until late 1988 ChipArmstrong, now 36 years old, worked as a $26,000-a-yearfireman and had a history of not repaying bank loans. In1985, he declared personal bankruptcy after the failure of asmall business he ran on the side -- temporary workers hiredby Mr. Armstrong sprayed fire-retardant material on the steelframes of commercial buildings.   Despite such reversals, Mr. Armstrong in the past twoyears came up with millions in cash to buy distressedproperties including some 300 oil and gas well operatingleases in southwest Texas, and thousands of acres of landnear cities like San Antonio and Dallas, including the DoubleC ranch. He leased plush offices surrounded by Remingtonbronzes, and dashed around in black limousines and aGulfstream jet, always accompanied by a bodyguard. He doledout six-figure donations to politicians such as Texasgubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams and to charityevents like the Dallas Opera Ball.   &quot;He's the mystery man,&quot; says Margot Winspear, a Dallassocialite. &quot;No one knows what he does or where the moneycomes from. He writes big checks, we all love him. We don'tknow him, but we all love him.&quot;   In the past few days a former Armstrong employee, SteveSolodoff, began to privately provide a number of majorcompanies and institutions with a simple explanation for Mr.Armstrong's suddenly apparent and seemingly inexhaustiblewealth.   Before he resigned last month, Mr. Solodoff was controllerof an obscure San Francisco firm, Hamilton Taft andamp; Co., ownedby Mr. Armstrong since March 1989. The firm annuallyprocesses $3.5 billion in payroll withholding taxes owed tothe Internal Revenue Service and other tax agencies for suchdiverse employers as Federal Express, Sony Corp., Castle andamp;Cooke, Stanford University, the State Bar of California andthe Oakland Athletics.   Mr. Solodoff alleges to federal authorities and in amemorandum filed with a federal suit that instead of promptlydepositing all of these funds with the proper governmentagency as stipulated by contract, Mr. Armstrong diverted manymillions to his own private uses in a kind of Ponzi schemenow on the verge of collapse. Some Hamilton Taft customersconfirm the diversions, and Mr. Solodoff estimates that theytotal nearly $100 million.   Hamilton Taft, it turns out, is one of the biggest taxprocessors in the country. But this isn't a great business tobe in right now. Last year, the IRS cut the lag time betweenpayday and tax payments from three days to one with astreamlined deposit process, sharply curtailing margins. Bigplayers like ADP and BankAmerica generate far better fees byoffering complete payroll services.   According to Mr. Solodoff, the lure for Mr. Armstrong wasnot profits but huge, totally unregulated cash flows. Accessto that money has helped him create a life style he couldonly dream of during 24-hour firehouse shifts, a life stylethat would allow him to star in his own rodeos anytime hewishes and meet the Dallas women he used to gaze at in thesociety pages.   Here's how the scheme worked, according to Mr. Solodoff'smemorandum filed with federal court documents: The basic ideawas to mask the nonpayment of taxes in a starting quarter.It's not too tough. All you do is report to the tax agencythat you are making the omitted payment late as the newquarter begins. You take the new quarter's payment and filllast quarter's hole. The hole keeps moving forward onequarter, while payments received in each successive quarterkeep filling it. The big reward for all this hole-filling isthe chunk of unpaid taxes from the starting quarter. It'sfound money.   But eventually, hole-filling gets very costly. That'swhere the Ponzi aspect comes in. The IRS assesses a 10%penalty plus interest on every late payment. Unless you areearning at least 10% quarterly (40% annually) on your &quot;foundmoney&quot; and pass it along to the tax man, you will have to digthe hole that much deeper each time around to repair thedamage.   As the bites get bigger and more clients are bitten, thechance increases that some client will get a penalty noticeand ask probing questions. Inside Hamilton Taft, these areknown as &quot;sensitive&quot; clients, according to Mr. Solodoff andanother former employee. A Hamilton Taft income statement for1990, included in court documents, shows $17 million inpenalties, vs. revenues of just $7 million on thissmall-margin business.   Acting on Mr. Solodoff's tip, customers representing halfof Hamilton Taft's deposits have suspended payments anddemanded proof from the company that it made complete andtimely deposits. Stonewalled by officials of Hamilton Taft,Federal Express, its single largest customer, filed abreach-of-contract suit Wednesday in federal court in SanFrancisco, and yesterday won a temporary restraining order toprevent the company from destroying crucial records. Mr.Solodoff's memorandum was filed with the Federal Expresssuit, and in another document, Federal Express attorney JamesMulroy cited &quot;extreme concern for up to $16 million FederalExpress's funds&quot; representing a recent interim tax payment.   Other customers facing potential liabilities in unpaidtaxes of over $1 million, according to a client list includedin court filings, include: Sun Microsystems, Tandem Computer,Neiman Marcus Group, Sony Corp. Claris Corp. S andamp; S CreditCos., Volume Shoe Corp., Commercial Credit Corp., R.R.Donnelly andamp; Sons, Stanford University, and the State Bar ofCalifornia.   One customer's attorney says, &quot;It looks like there havebeen cases where they didn't make payments they werecontracted to make, or made them late and incurred penalties.Now we are trying to figure out if we are in the hole. Isuspect we are but I'm not certain. We will know within a dayor two.&quot;   Whether these customers will suffer actual losses willdepend on Hamilton Taft's ability to generate cash quicklyfrom certain investments on its books. As of Dec. 31, it heldnotes totaling $69 million from companies owned by oraffiliated with Mr. Armstrong, according to an unauditedcompany balance sheet.   &quot;There is uncertainty of the company's ability to meet itsobligations,&quot; says Anthony Dolanski of KPMG Peat Marwick,Hamilton Taft's accountant. In a June 1989 review, PeatMarwick cited a $19 million working-capital deficit and said&quot;substantially more funds have been collected from clientsthan are currently available to pay those clients' taxes.&quot; Byyear-end 1990, an internal balance sheet shows, that figurehad swelled to $87 million.   Peat Marwick says it has failed for two years to completea full audit of the company's books because Hamilton Taft hasnot provided necessary data. Even so, it recently billed Mr.Armstrong $87,000 for its services.   &quot;The jig is up,&quot; says Mr. Solodoff in an interview, addingthat he has told everything he knows to the Internal RevenueService and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He says hediscovered the alleged scheme shortly before resigning fromHamilton Taft, where he was employed for seven months. &quot;Itmade me sick to see Chip was getting away with this.&quot; Mr.Solodoff may also be motivated by a potential reward of up to25% of any taxes recovered under provisions of the FalseClaims Act.   Meanwhile, a growing number of executives are leaving Mr.Armstrong's various personal holding companies. Departures inthe last few months include Steven Lau, Hamilton Taft's vicepresident of cash management; Christine Grambling, HamiltonTaft president; Barry Morgan, a chief accountant forRemington Cos., Mr. Armstrong's real-estate concern; G.Michael Hargis, president of Dresdner Enterprises, his oilcompany, and George O'Brien, president of Knightsbridge Cos.,a holding company for many of Mr. Armstrong's enterprises,including Hamilton Taft.   &quot;I really want to tell our side of the story,&quot; says Mr.Armstrong, in a brief interview with this newspaper. Tall andtanned, with his light brown hair falling over the collar ofhis double-breasted suit in a &quot;Miami Vice&quot; look, he shows notthe slightest trace of anxiety.   His father, Connie C. Armstrong, has shown considerableinitiative and energy in his own dealings, according toevidence connected to his 1987 indictment on charges oflaundering nearly $1 million, partly through Premier Bank, aDallas bank with assets of $28 million that he was chairmanof. One piece of evidence was a taped conversation betweenthe senior Mr. Armstrong and a federal agent posing as aColombian money runner. According to former assistant U.S.attorney William Sheetz, Mr. Armstrong said on the tape that&quot;I can move money in car washes, I can wash money. I wantyour money and I will move it.&quot; The trial had barely begunbefore he pleaded guilty to one of the charges and went tojail.   The junior Mr. Armstrong, the eldest of five sons, isn'ttalking any more, on advice of his attorney. In a letter Mr.Armstrong sent to customers Tuesday, he said, &quot;We will standup to the highest levels of scrutiny to disprove these falseand malicious allegations&quot; made by Mr. Solodoff. He refers toMr. Solodoff as a &quot;disgruntled&quot; employee.   Exactly how Mr. Armstrong got control of Hamilton Taft isunclear. The former owner, called MaxPharma Inc., in July1988 pledged the stock of Hamilton Taft, which it had justbought from Cigna Corp., for $4.1 million, to a &quot;privateinvestor&quot; who gave MaxPharma an emergency $500,000 loan. InMarch 1989, Mr. Armstrong became the sole owner &quot;in exchangeof consideration (including costs) of approximately$881,000,&quot; according to internal Hamilton Taft documents.   Where that money came from is also a mystery. There isevidence that his father has helped finance him in the past.The senior Mr. Armstrong's Premier Bank made a loan to hisson in 1986. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., as receiverfor the failed bank, has sued the son in Dallas federalcourt, in an attempt to recover the loan proceeds.   Clearly, Mr. Armstrong had grand plans. A corporatebrochure, printed in English and French, anticipated adoubling of &quot;gross deposits&quot; in one year to $10 billion --presumably through new Hamilton Taft customers -- andprojected that the burgeoning empire would &quot;focus onfinancial services such as cash and portfolio management tobenefit from enormous growth opportunities we believe arebecoming available in the new Europe.&quot; Plans to open anoffice in Geneva were mentioned.   Perhaps most telling, in the brochure's cover letter, Mr.Armstrong writes: &quot;As we have grown, I have never lost sightof the importance of maintaining both fiscal and personalintegrity. These deep and honest values are at the roots ofmy Texas heritage.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
