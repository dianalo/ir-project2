Waldheim was the first Western leader to meet face-to-face withSaddam since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The Austrianleader was accompanied by his foreign minister, Alois Mock, andother Austrian officials.   The special Iraqi Airways flight carrying Waldheim and theAustrian evacueess landed in Amman, Jordan, on Saturday evening.The Austrian evacuees immediately boarded a plane for Vienna, andWaldheim stayed behind in Amman.   At Amman's airport, Waldheim told reporters he still held outhope for a diplomatic settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis.   ``Of course, I cannot tell you what the outcome will be. But thepresident (Saddam) assured me that he continues to be interested ina peaceful negotiated settlement.''   Waldheim said later that he had raised with Saddam the issue ofU.S. citizens and other Westerners who have not been allowed toleave Iraq and Kuwait, but he received no commitments from theIraqi leader.   ``The president (Saddam) was very serious in discussing thismatter with me ... and it is my hope that it will take a positivedevelopment,'' Waldheim told The Associated Press in an interviewat an Amman hotel.   He said he told Saddam: ``I hope that it will be possible to dosomething for the other citizens too. And the president said hewill keep it in mind. He didn't give me any immediate answer.''   An Austrian embassy official in Amman said 96 Austrians,including about 30 women and 15 children, arrived on the flightfrom Iraq. Earlier, an Austrian diplomat in Baghdad had said about80 people _ mainly workers, technicians and their families _ wereleaving with Waldheim.   Waldheim said four Austrians stayed behind in Baghdad to takecare of personal and business affairs, and would be travelingoverland to Jordan in the next few days.   Franz Pernegger, the Austrian ambassador to Jordan, said Iraqiauthorities arranged for helicopters to fly Austrians strandedelsewhere in Iraq to Baghdad so they could leave with Waldheim.   Waldheim, interviewed by the Cable News Network in Amman, saidAustria ``did not make any concessions and we were not asked to''in order to obtain permission for its citizens to leave Iraq.   In Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said Waldheim and theIraqi president were joined in their meeting by Foreign MinisterTariq Aziz; Izzat Ibrahim, vice chairman of the Iraqi RevolutionaryCouncil, and other council members.   About 21,000 Westerners, including 3,000 Americans and 4,500Britons, are stranded in Iraq and Kuwait. Saddam has barred themfrom leaving and he confirmed Saturday that some were taken tostrategic points, including missile bases and oil refineries.   ``This measure is not meant to protect us against attacks, it ismeant to prevent attacks from happening,'' Saddam said at a newsconference with Austrian reporters.   ``We hope that our hosting of the rest of the foreigners herewill not last long,'' but he added that this depended on ``theremoval of the specter of war which the U.S.A. seeks to ignite inthe area.''   Waldheim arrived aboard an Iraqi presidential plane and wasgreeted at the airport by Saddam, diplomats said, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Waldheim got to know Arab leaders during his 10 years as U.N.secretary-general. Most Western leaders have shunned him andAmerica barred him after disclosures that he served during WorldWar II with a German army unit implicated in atrocities, and latermisrepresented his war record.   Saddam held the impromptu news conference for Austrian reportersaccompanying Waldheim before the talks began. It was carried byAustrian radio and broadcast later on Iraqi TV, picked up by CableNews Network. It was his first talk with Western reporters sincethe crisis began.   Saddam, dressed in a gray suit, told reporters Iraqi troopsdon't plan to withdraw from Kuwait.   He said the United States had occupied Saudi Arabia and otherholy places of Islam and the ``Arab world condemns this.''   A multinational military force, composed largely of U.S. troopssent by President Bush, has been building up in neighboring SaudiArabia following the invasion of Kuwait.   Saddam termed Western military action ``a naked aggression.''   He characterized as corrupt the government of Kuwait that wasdriven into exile _ ``sitting around gambling tables wastingmillions. This is the type of Arab character Bush wants to bringback to Kuwait.''   In news conference remarks broadcast by CNN, Saddam said he wasready to negotiate over the crisis, but that Western powers hadn'toffered to open talks.   ``I shall say that whatever collides with Iraq will find colmnsof dead bodies which may have a beginning but may not have an end.We want the Americans to live. We do not want them to die. In thesame way we want the Iraqis to live and not die,'' Saddam said.   ``So it is the duty of Americans now to bear in mind that theymust resort to a political solution and not to force, and to endthis tendency they have that they can have anything they want.''   He also said that with the annexation of Kuwait, Iraq seeks noother Arab territory.</TEXT></DOC>
