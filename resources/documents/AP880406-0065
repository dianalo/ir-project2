A statement attributed to former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''Honasan said his group promised last November to cease hostile actsagainst Mrs. Aquino to give her time to fulfill promises to improvethe government. Mrs. Aquino made the promises after Honasan's theAug. 28 coup attempt.   ``We are now withdrawing that declaration,'' said the statementfrom Honasan, 39. ``It has become obvious by its own actions, thatthe Aquino administration is incapable of ensuring the verysurvival of this nation over the next few years. We have to act andact boldly.''   The statement was distributed today to news organizations.Honasan escaped Saturday from a prison ship in Manila Bay, where hehad been held since his arrest Dec. 9. Military spokesman Col.Oscar Florendo said troops had found no trace of Honasan despite anationwide search.   Mrs. Aquino today told reporters her government had taken stepsto correct problems raised by Honasan during his abortive coupattempt, in which at least 53 people were killed and hundredswounded.   ``I think he will have to admit that the government hadadequately answered already the legitimate grievances, and I thinkthe Filipino people definitely will go against Honasan,'' Mrs.Aquino said. ``He will not be able to get any support.''   Honasan's complaints included low military pay and lack of aneffective strategy against communist rebels. The coup attempt wasthe most serious of six major bids to topple Mrs. Aquino since shetook office on Feb. 25, 1986.   Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos described the Honasan statementas ``a call to violence'' and said the author ``must have adistorted sense of values.'' Ramos said he had ordered the militaryto verify its authenticity.   ``The letter, as you know, threatens not only the government butthe entire society,'' Ramos told reporters. ``I am very sure thatour people will reject such an undertaking by anyone.''   National Security Adviser Emmanuel Soriano also doubted Honasancould mount a serious coup attempt but said the government was in astate of ``watchful waiting.'' Mrs. Aquino plans to go ahead with avisit next week to China and Hong Kong.   In his statement, Honasan said he and others jailed in previouscoup attempts had been detained for months without formal chargesor trial.   He claimed the government was more concerned about protectingthe rights of jailed members of the Communist Party of thePhilippines and its armed wing, the New People's Army, rather thanthose of its own soldiers.   ``Apparently, this administration has no intention of effectinggenuine reconciliation in our fragmented society because of itsinordinate fear of losing power to people whose only vision is toset a new direction toward good government and a reformed''military, he said.   ``To this day, after seven months, many officers and menimplicated in the August 28 incident are still detained withoutcharges and without trial.   ``Their right to due process and speedy trial were completelydisregarded by the Aquino administration despite its pretensions ofbeing democratic and just, while affording the same rights tocaptured'' communist guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
