Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, said during aspeech to the American Legion Wednesday that the Japanese attack onPearl Harbor occurred on Sept. 7, 1941 _ not on Dec. 7, one of thebest-known dates in U.S. history.   George Bush Jr., during a discussion about the campaign withMichael Jackson, the syndicated talk show host, lamented onThursday that ``the problem is that so much of what we see inpresidential politics is the 15-second sound bite on TV.''   ``Last night for example, the 15-second sound bite on my dad onthe national networks was the fact that he slipped for 45 secondson whether Pearl Harbor was on Sept 9 or Dec. 9.   ``And they made a big deal of that on TV. I didn't quite get thepoint, because he, you know, corrected himself.''   Jackson did not note the younger Bush's mistake during theinterview.   Vice President Bush said Wednesday, ``I wonder how manyAmericans remember. Today is Pearl Harbor Day. Forty-seven yearsago to this very day we were hit, and hit hard at Pearl Harbor. Wewere not ready.   ``In a Bush administration, that lesson would not be forgotten.''   Within a minute or so, after prompting from the audience andfrom others on the speakers' platform, Bush corrected himself.</TEXT></DOC>
