The characteristics ofthe various methods of extracting power from the environment are differentand require different techniques for measuring and processing the rawdata. The routine use of meteorological data by a company designing andinstalling small energy systems using wind, solar and hydro power isconsidered. Extensive meteorological analysis on a long timescale isnot economically feasible in most cases but by using the available datawith care accurate estimates can be made.</TEXT></DOC>
