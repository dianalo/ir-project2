The Proposed Decision and Order tentatively establishes proceduresto distribute to eligible claimants $7,104,217.29, plus accrued interest,obtained by the DOE under the terms of a consent order entered into withMurphy Oil Corporation on February 9, 1987. The funds were paid by Murphytowards the settlement of possible violations of the DOE price and allocationregulations relating to transactions by Murphy involving the marketingof refined petroleum products during the period January 1, 1973 throughJanuary 27, 1981 (the consent order period).We propose to distribute these funds in two stages. In the first stage,we will accept claims from identifiable purchasers of Murphy refined petroleumproducts who may have been injured by Murphy's pricing practices duringthe consent order period. The specific requirements which an applicantmust meet in order to receive a refund are set out in Section III of theProposed Decision. Claimants who meet these specific requirements willbe eligible to receive refunds based on the number of gallons of refinedpetroleum products which they purchased from Murphy. Applications for Refundshould <T3>not</T3> be filed at this time. Appropriate public notice will be providedprior to the acceptance of claims. If any funds remain after meritoriousclaims are paid in the first stage, they may be used for indirect restitutionin accordance with the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and RestitutionAct of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-509, 1 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 11,702.Any member of the public may submit written comments regardig the proposedrefund procedures. Commenting parties are requested to submit two copiesof their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and should be sent to the address set forth atthe beginning of this notice. All comments received will be available forpublic inspection between the hours of 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., Mondaythrough Friday, except federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room ofthe Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E-234, 1000 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">George B.

Pursuant to the provisions ofSubpart V, on June 10, 1987, the ERA filed a Petition for the Implementationof Special Refund Procedures to distribute funds received from Murphy OilCorporation (Murphy) under the terms of a February 9, 1987 consent orderwith Murphy. In its Petition, the ERA requests that the OHA establish specialprocedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of the allegedregulatory violations that were settled in the Murphy Consent Order.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Background</ITAG>Murphy is a major integrated refiner which produced and sold crude oiland a full range of refined petroleum products during the period of federalprice controls. The firm was therefore subject to the Mandatory PetroleumPrice and Allocation Regulations set forth at 6 CFR Part 150 and 10 CFRParts 210, 211, 212. During the course of controls, the ERA conducted anextensive audit of Murphy's operations and, as a result of the audit, allegedthat Murphy had violated certain applicable DOE price and allocation regulationsin its sales of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Settlement discussionswere held, and on February 9, 1987, the ERA and Murphy finalized a consentorder (Consent Order No. RMUH01983Z) that resolved issues pertaining toMurphy's refined petroleum product operations during the period January1, 1973 through January 27, 1981 (the consent order period). Pursuant tothe terms of the consent order, Murphy remitted a total of $7,104,217.9(the consent order fund) \1\<NOTE/> to the DOE for distribution through Subpart V. These fundsare being held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at theDepartment of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their properdistribution. With interest, the amount in the Murphy consent order escrowaccount had grown to $7,438,602.94 as of December 31, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ This amount consists of the principal consent order amountof $7,000,000 plus $104,217.29 in interest which accrued prior to Murphy'spayment to the DOE. For accounting purposes, the interest remitted by Murphyshall be considered as additional principal.<ITAG tagnum="81">II. Jurisdiction and Authority</ITAG>The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be usedby the OHA in formulating and implementing a plan of distribution of fundsreceived as a result of enforcement proceedings. The DOE policy is to usethe Subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussionof Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distributerefunds, <T3>see Office of Enforcement,</T3> 9 DOE andpara;82,508 (1981), and <T3>Office of Enforcement,</T3> 8 DOE andpara;82,597 (1981).We have considered the ERA's petition that we implement a Subpart V proceedingwith respect to the Murphy consent order fund and have determined thatsuch a proceeding is appropriate. We will grant the ERA's request. ThisProposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's tentative plan to distributethese funds. Comments are solicited.<ITAG tagnum="81">III. Proposed Refund Procedures</ITAG>We propose to implement a two-stage refund process by which firms and individualswho purchased Murphy refined petroleum products during the consent orderperiod may submit Applications for Refund in the initial stage. From ourexperience with Subpart V proceedings, we expect that potential applicantswill fall into the following categories of Murphy refined product purchasers:(i) end-users, i.e. ultimate consumers; (ii) regulated entities, such aspublic utilities or cooperatives; and (iii) retailers, resellers, and refinersthat resold Murphy products.In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submita schedule of its monthly purchases of Murphy refined petroleum productsduring the consent order period. If the product was not purchased directlyfrom Murphy, the claimant must provide a statement setting forth its reasonsfor maintaining that the product originated with Murphy.In addition, a refiner, reseller, or retailer claimant, except those whochoose to utilize the injury presumptions set forth below, will be requiredto make a detailed showing that it was injured by the alleged overcharges.This showing will generally consist of two distinct elements. First, aclaimant will be required to show that it maintained ``banks'' of unrecoupedincreased product costs (banked costs) in excess of the refund claimed.\2\<NOTE/> Second, because a showing of banks alone is not sufficientto establish injury, a claimant must provide evidence that market conditionsprecluded it from increasing its prices to pass through the additionalcosts associated with the alleged overcharges. <T3>See National Helium Corp./Atlantic Richfield Co.,</T3> 11 DOE andpara;85,257(1984), <T3>aff'd sub nom Atlantic Richfield Co. v. DOE,</T3> 618 F. Supp. 1199,(D. Del. 1985). Such a showing could consist of a demonstration that thefirm suffered a competitive disadvantage as a result of its purchases fromMurphy. <T3>Id.;</T3> <T3>see also Sid Richardson Carbon and Gasoline Company and RichardsonProducts Company/Shupbach and Streitmatter Gas Company,</T3> 14 DOE andpara;85,186(1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Claimants who have previously relied upon their bankedcosts in order to be eligible to receive refunds in other special refundproceedings should subtract those refunds from the cumulative banked costssubmitted in this proceeding. <T3>See Husky Oil Co./Metro Oil Products, Inc.,</T3> 16 DOE andpara;85,090at 88,179 (1987).1. <T3>Presumptions for Claims Based Upon Refined Product Purchases.</T3>Our experience also indicates that the use of certain presumptions permitsclaimants to participate in the refund process without incurring inordinateexpense, and ensures that refund claims are evaluated in the most efficientmanner possible. <T3>See, e.g., Marathon Petroleum Company,</T3> 14 DOE andpara;85,269 (1986)(<T3>Marathon</T3>). Presumptions in refund cases are specifically authorizedby the applicable DOE procedural regulations at 10 CFR 205.282(e). Accordingly,we propose to adopt the presumptions set forth below.First, we will adopt a presumption that the alleged overcharges were dispersedequally in all of Murphy's sales of refined petroleum products during theconsent order period. In accordance with this presumption, refunds areto be made on a pro-rata or volumetric basis. In the absence of betterinformation, a volumetric refund approach is appropriate because the DOEprice regulations generally required a regulated firm to account for increasedcosts on a firm-wide basis in determining its prices.Under the volumetric approach, a claimant's allocable share of the refinedproduct pool is equal to the number of gallons purchased times the pergallon refund amount (plus an appropriate share of the interest which hasaccrued on the Murphy consent order fund).\3\<NOTE/> In the present case, the per gallon refund amount is $0.000817.We derived this figure by dividing the consent order funds ($7,104,217.29)by the approximate number of gallons of refined products subject to priceand allocation controls sold by Murphy during the consent order period(8,695,987,648 gallons). As in previous cases, we will establish a minimumrefund amount of $15.00. We have found through our experience that thecost of processing claims in which refunds for amounts less than $15.00are sought outweighs the benefits of restitution in those instances. <T3>See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp.,</T3> 13 DOE andpara;85,339 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Because we realize that the impact on an individual claimantmay have been greater than the volumetric amount, we will allow any purchaserto file a refund application based upon a claim that an allocation on thebasis of a specifically alleged overcharge amount should be used in consideringits refund application. <T3>See, e.g., Standard Oil Co. </T3>(<T3>Indiana)/Army and Air Force Exchange Service,</T3> 12 DOE andpara;85,015(1984).In addition to the volumetric presumption, we also propose to adopt a numberof presumptions regarding injury for claimants in each category listedbelow.a. <T3>End-users.</T3> In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, wepropose to adopt the presumption that an end-user or ultimate consumerof Murphy petroleum products whose business is unrelated to the petroleumindustry was injured by the alleged overcharges settled by the consentorder. <T3>See, e.g., Texas Oil and Gas Corp.,</T3> 12 DOE <ITAG tagnum="54">andpara;85,069 at 88,209 (1984) (</ITAG><T3>TOGCO</T3>). Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry, membersof this group generally were not subject to price controls during the consentorder period, and were not required to keep records which justified sellingprice increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently, analysisof the impact of the alleged overcharges on the final prices of goods andservices produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope ofa special refund proceeding. <T3>Id. </T3>We therefore propose that end-users of Murphy refined petroleumproducts need only document their purchase volumes from Murphy during theconsent order period to make a sufficient showing that they were injuredby the alleged overcharges.  b. <T3>Regulated Firms and Cooperatives.</T3> We further propose that, inorder to receive a full volumetric refund, a claimant whose prices forgoods and services are regulated by a governmental agency, e.g., a publicutility, or by the terms of a cooperative agreement, need only submit documentationof purchase volumes used by itself or, in the case of a cooperative, soldto its members.\4\<NOTE/> However, a regulated firm or cooperative will also be requiredto certify that it will pass through any refund received to its customersor member-customers, provide us with a full explanation of how it plansto accomplish the restitution, and certify that it will notify the appropriateregulatory body or membership group of its receipt of the refund. <T3>See Marathon, </T3>14 DOE at 88,515; <T3>Office of Special Counsel, </T3>9 DOE andpara;82,538 at 85,203 (1982).This latter requirement is based upon the presumption that, with respectto a regulated firm, any overcharges would have been routinely passed throughto its customers through the operation of automatic adjustment mechanisms.Similarly, any refunds received would be passed through to its customers.With respect to a cooperative, in general, the cooperative agreements whichcontrol prices would ensure that the alleged overcharges and, similarly,refunds would be passed through to its member-customers. Accordingly, thesefirms will not be required to make a detailed demonstration of injury. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\A cooperative's sales to non-members will be treated inthe same manner as sales by other resellers. <T3>See Marathon, </T3>14 DOE at 88,515.  c. <T3>Refiners, Resellers, and Retailers Seeking Refunds of $5,000 or Less.</T3>We propose to adopt a presumption that a firm who resold Murphy productsand requests a small refund was injured by the alleged regulatory violations.Under the small claims presumption, a refiner, reseller, or retailer seekinga refund of $5,000 or less, exclusive of interest (i.e. who purchased lessthan 6,119,951 gallons of Murphy refined petroleum products during theconsent order period), will not be required to submit evidence of injurybeyond documentation of the volume of Murphy covered products it purchasedduring the consent order period. <T3>See TOGCO. </T3>As we have noted in numerous prior proceedings, theremay be considerable expense involved in gathering the types of data necessaryto support a detailed claim of injury; in some cases, that expense mightpossibly exceed the expected refund. Consequently, failure to allow simplifiedapplication procedures for small claims could deprive injured parties oftheir opportunity to obtain a refund. Furthermore, use of the small claimspresumption is desirable in that it allows the OHA to process the largenumber of routine refund claims expected in an efficient manner.\5\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\Claimants who attempt to make a detailed showing of injuryin order to support a large refund claim but, instead, provide evidencethat leads us to conclude that they passed through all of the alleged overchargesor are eligible for a refund of less than $5,000, will not be entitledto a $5,000 small claims threshold refund. <T3>See Union Texas Petroleum Corp./Arrow Enterprises, Inc., </T3>15 DOEandpara;85,087 (1986); <T3>Quaker State Oil Refining Corp./Campbell Oil Co., </T3>15 DOE andpara;85,089(1986).  d. <T3>Medium-Range Refiner, Reseller and Retailer Claimants. </T3>In lieuof making a detailed showing of injury, a refiner, reseller, or retailerclaimant whose allocable share exceeds $5,000 may elect to receive as itsrefund the larger of $5,000 or 40 percent of its allocable share up to$50,000.\6\<NOTE/> The use of this presumption reflects our conviction thatthese larger claimants were likely to have experienced some injury as aresult of the alleged overcharges. <T3>See Marathon, </T3>14 DOE at 88,515. In a number of prior special refundproceedings, we performed detailed economic analysis in order to determineproduct-specific levels of injury. <T3>See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara;85,339 (1985). However,in <T3>Gulf Oil Corp., </T3>16 DOE andpara;85,381 (1987) we determined thatit was most efficient to adopt a single general presumptive level of injuryof 40 percent for all medium-range claimants, regardless of the refinedproducts they purchased, based upon the results of our analyses in priorproceedings. We therefore propose to adopt the 40 percent presumptive levelof injury for all medium-range claimants in this proceeding. Consequently,an applicant in this group will only be required to provide documentationof its purchase volumes of Murphy refined petroleum products during theconsent order period in order to be eligible to receive a refund of 40percent of its total volumetric share.\7\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\That is, claimants who purchased between 6,119,951 gallonsand 152,998,776 gallons of Murphy refined petroleum products during theconsent order period (medium-range claimants) may elect to utilize thispresumption. Claimants who purchased more than 152,998,776 gallons mayelect to limit their claim to $50,000.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\A medium-range claimant may elect not to receive a refundbased upon this presumption and may instead attempt to show that it iseligible for a refund equal to its full allocable share by making a detailedshowing of injury using the general criteria set forth above. However,as with the small claims presumption, the 40 percent presumption will notbe available to medium-range claimants who submit a detailed injury showingwhich leads us to conclude that they are eligible for a refund of lessthan 40 percent of their volumetric share. <T3>See n.5 infra.</T3>  e. <T3>Spot Purchasers. </T3>We propose to adopt a rebuttable presumptionthat a refiner, reseller or retailer that made only spot purchases fromMurphy did not suffer injury as a result of those purchases. As we havepreviously stated, spot purchasers tend to have considerable discretionas to the timing and market in which to make purchases and therefore wouldnot have made spot market purchases from a firm at increased prices unlessthey were able to pass through the full amount of the firm's selling priceto their own customers. <T3>See Office of Enforcement, </T3>8 DOE andpara;82,597 at 85,396-97 (1981).Accordingly, a spot purchaser claimant must submit specific and detailedevidence to rebut the spot purchaser presumption and to establish the extentto which it was injured as result of its spot purchases from Murphy.\8\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\In prior proceedings we have stated that refunds will beapproved for spot purchasers who demonstate that (i) they made the spotpurchases for the purpose of ensuring a supply for their base period customersrather than in anticipation of financial advantage as a result of thosepurchases, and (ii) they were forced by market conditions to resell theproduct at a loss that was not subsequently recouped. <T3>See Quaker State Oil Refining Corp./Certified Gasoline Co., </T3>14DOE andpara;85,465 (1986).  f. <T3>Consignees. </T3>A consignee agent is a firm that distributed coveredproducts pursuant to a contractural agreement with a refiner, under whichthe refiner retained title to the products, specified the price to be paidby the purchaser and paid the consignee a commission based upon the volumeof covered products it distributed. 10 CFR 212.31 (definition of ``consigneeagent''). As in previous decisions, we propose to adopt the rebuttablepresumption that consignees of Murphy refined petroleum products were notinjured as a result of their arrangement with their refiner/supplier. <T3>See, e.g., Jay Oil Company, </T3>16 DOE andpara;85,147 (1987). However,we also propose that a consignee may rebut this presumption of non-injuryby establishing that ``[its] sales volumes, and [its] corresponding commissionrevenues, declined due to the alleged uncompetitiveness of [the consentorder firm's] practices. <T3>See Gulf Oil Corp./C.F. Canter Oil Co., </T3>13 DOE andpara;85,388 at88,962 (1986).  2. <T3>Allocation Claims. </T3>We also recognize that we may receive claimsbased upon Murphy's alleged failure to furnish petroleum products thatit was obliged to supply to the claimant under the DOE allocation regulations.<T3>See </T3>10 CFR Part 211. We will evaluate refund applications basedupon allocation claims by referring to the standards set forth in Decisionssuch as <T3>Amoco, </T3>10 DOE at 88,220, and <T3>OKC Corp./Town andamp; Country Markets, Inc., </T3>12 DOE andpara;85,094(1984). Under those standards an allocation claimant first must demonstratethe existence of a supplier/purchaser relationship with the consent orderfirm and the likelihood that the consent order firm failed to furnish petroleumproducts that it was obliged to supply to the claimant under 10 CFR Part211. Secondly, it should provide evidence that it had contemporaneouslynotified the DOE or otherwise sought redress from the alleged allocationviolation. Finally, it must establish that it was injured and documentthe extent of the injury.  3. <T3>Distribution of Product Funds Remaining After First Stage. </T3>Wepropose that any refined product funds that remain after all first stageclaims have been decided be distributed in accordance with the provisionsof the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA),Pub. L. 99-509, Title III. <T3>See</T3> Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara;11,702 et seq. PODRA requiresthat the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overchargefunds that will not be required to refund monies to injured parties inSubpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governmentsfor use in four energy conservation programs. PODRA, Sections 3003 (c)and (d). The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA,and any refined product pool funds in the Murphy consent order escrow accountthat the OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitutionto injured Murphy customers will be distributed in accordance with theprovisions of PODRA.  <ITAG tagnum="81">IV. Applications for Refund  </ITAG>Applications for Refund should not be filed at this time. Detailed proceduresfor filing Applications will be provided in a final Decision and Order.Before disposing of any of the funds received as a result of the Murphyconsent order, we intend to publicize the distribution process in orderto solicit comments on all aspects of the foregoing Proposed Decision andOrder from interested parties. All comments must be filed within 30 daysof the publication of this Proposed Decision in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>  It Is Therefore Ordered That:  The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Murphy Oil Companypursuant to Consent Order No. RMUH01983Z, finalized on February 9, 1987,will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.  <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-2412 Filed 2-4-88; 8:45 am]  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M        </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
