Quite the contrary, he says, U.S. negotiators are holding to ahard line that calls for the elimination of trade-distortingsubsidies over the long haul.   ``The United States will continue to aggressively seekelimination of trade-distorting measures,'' he said. ``Thelong-term component of the negotiations will indeed be an arduousexercise, but it i is long overdue.''   Some may have thought the EEC won a victory of sorts when itblocked some of the wording initially offered in the U.S. proposalseeking the eventual ``elimination'' s an effort thatof trade-distortingsubsidies.   Even after the United States changed the wording to seek a``ratcheting'' down of the subsidies in future years, the 12-nationtrading bloc remained unmovable.   Finally, in Geneva talks the week of April 2-8, more than 100countries reached agreement on an agricultural framework to be usedin further trade negotiations in the months ahead. It calls for a``substantial progressive reduction'' of disruptive farm subsidies.No mentionon that the committmentmust be consistent with existing legislation.''   The report added: ``Our assessment is that this will not requireus to do anything differently from what we are now doing. For 1990,our 1985 farm legislation requires cuts in some support prices.''   In other words, the report said, the short-term agreement is apolitical commitment to prevent worsening of policies that distortagricultural trade while long-term reform is being negotiated.   Here are further observations from the Yeutter background reporton the short-term agreement reached in Geneva and how the accordmay affect U.S. programs:   _ The operation of the sugar program, including import quotas,will not be restricted.   _ No commitment was made on the operation of the acreagereduction programs that cover major crops such as wheat and feedgrains. Other countries were convinced that it would be unwise to``bind our hands'' when U.S. and global stockpiles are low.   _ Spending under the Export Enhancement Program _ EEP _ andother export programs will not be frozen. There was no specificcommitment on the level of expenditure for any single program,although ``export subsidization is included as part of a broadcommitment not to exceed current levels of domestic and exportsupport and protection.''   Under EEP, targeted countries can buy U.S. commodities atsubsidized prices. The program is aimed at keeping U.S. productscompetitive with other countries, notably the EEC, which subsidizeexports.   _ Trade retaliation will not be prohibited under so-calledSection 301 procedures. The United States said since the beginningof the Uruguay Round that ``we would not suspend our right todefend ourselves against unfair trade practices during the courseof the negotiations.''   _ There is no plan to initiate Section 301 action against Japanbecause of its restriction on imports of rice. The United Statessaid Japanese rice is a subject for the Uruguay Round, and ``aslong as Japan continues to be cooperative in the negotiations, wewill stick to that approach.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 16</NOTE></DOC>
