Merchants expect to avoid the kind of bloodbath that followed last year's stock-market crash, when store operators panicked and slashed prices earlier and more aggressively than usual to clear out inventories that were already bloated at the start of the holiday season.    But the modest sales increases forecast for the Christmas season -- which typically accounts for 35% to 55% of a store's annual sales and profits -- aren't likely to make many retailers squeal with delight. Most economists, analysts and store executives say sales will rise by only as much as 6% or 7% from last year's depressed levels. After adjusting for inflation, which is running at close to a 4% annual rate, receipts could be flat or show only marginal increases of as much as 2% or 3%.    That would represent one of the slowest inflation-adjusted retail sales growth rates of the six holiday periods in the current economic expansion. &quot;Retailers must adjust their expectations,&quot; says Rosalind Wells, chief economist at the National Retail Merchants Association. &quot;In the current environment, a good performance is not a double-digit gain. It's 6%, or 2% after inflation.&quot;    The reason: &quot;People just don't have the pent-up demand for goods that they did in 1983,&quot; she says. Inflation-adjusted general-merchandise sales rose more than 10% in the fourth quarter of 1983, the first full holiday season after the last recession.    Sluggish Christmas sales are expected to contribute to a slowdown in the overall economic growth rate. Data Resources, for instance, is estimating an inflation-adjusted increase in gross national product, which measures the total output of goods and services, of only 1.4% for the fourth quarter. That would be the slowest quarterly increase in two years. &quot;The strength in the economy is in exports,&quot; says Jill Thompson, a senior economist at the economic-forecasting firm. &quot;It's not in consumption in the current quarter.&quot;    Indeed, many retailers this year are describing as &quot;good&quot; any sales that simply outpace inflation. That's because, through the first 10 months of 1988, the persistent slump in women's apparel led to a decline in inflation-adjusted sales at many stores open at least a year. PaineWebber Inc., for instance, says its index of same-store sales for 20 retailers this year inched up only 2.8% through October -- falling short of the inflation rate.    &quot;Many retailers didn't get the benefit of the strong period of growth we had in the first half of the year,&quot; says Sandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group in Washington, D.C. &quot;Consumers were buying cars and home goods, but they weren't buying much in the way of soft goods such as apparel.&quot;    Retailers say they learned from experience to keep their inventories lean. And by doing so, they say they can prevent the kind of unplanned discounting that depressed sales and profits last Christmas.    &quot;The nervous promotions that we saw last year probably won't be repeated,&quot; says Philip M. Hawley, chairman of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., in Los Angeles. &quot;I don't hear anybody saying they have 10% or 15% more inventory.&quot;    Adds Kurt Barnard, a consultant and publisher of the trade newsletter, Retail Marketing Report: &quot;Most stores have been buying hand to mouth. They are more likely to be out of stock than have unsaleable merchandise on their hands.&quot;    This is bad news for consumers, who might not find as many bargains this holiday season as last year. But for retailers, it could mean profit increases in the fourth quarter of as much as 15% to 20% from last year's depressed levels, according to Walter Loeb, an analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    One wild card is how deeply Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., Chicago, will slash prices. If it cuts prices sharply as part of its plan to clear out inventory in preparation for the new low-pricing policy announced last week, Sears could trigger a tidal wave of discounting among competitors that include department stores, discount chains and big specialty stores.    Sears, which rings up annual sales of nearly $23 billion through its 825 U.S. stores and catalogs and is the nation's largest retailer, says only that it is planning &quot;the largest promotion in its history&quot; this holiday season. A spokesman says Sears will cut prices on all Christmas merchandise, including apparel, hardware, and electronic goods, but he declines to say by how much.    For the time being, Sears's competitors are taking a wait-and-see approach. But &quot;if Sears starts holding what looks like a liquidation sale, that will put pressure on everybody,&quot; says George C. Hite, a vice president at the Target discount-store unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., Minneapolis. &quot;We'll do what we need to do to see that our customer continues to get the best possible price in our store on comparable items,&quot; he adds.    Discounting might also break out if retailers discover that they are sitting on too much inventory. Despite comments to the contrary, retailers' merchandise stocks have been creeping up to a level that could prompt some price cutting, contends Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at the Management Horizons retail-consulting unit of Price Waterhouse. Based on Commerce Department figures for September, the inventory-to-sales ratio for retailers now exceeds last year's level, he says.    Some retailers, of course, will run against the trend. F.W. Woolworth andamp; Co., New York, for instance, has outpaced the industry this year, partly because its athletic-shoe business has been strong and it doesn't rely much on sales of women's clothing. Harold Sells, the company's chairman, predicts that holiday sales will keep pace with the 12% gains it has registered so far this year.    Among other retailers, specialty-apparel stores are generally expected to do best, recording sales gains approaching 7% from last year's depressed level. Department stores are likely to show more-modest gains in the 5% to 5.5% range. Discount stores could do even worse, Mr. Steidtmann says, because the poorest 60% of U.S. households have experienced little or no growth in disposable income over the past two years.    Consumers generally don't seem to be in the mood for a big buying binge. In its October survey of consumers' buying plans, Leo J. Shapiro andamp; Associates, a market-research firm in Chicago, found that the percentage of people who intend to spend more on Christmas gifts this year declined to 28% from 33% a year earlier. The percentage of people who plan to spend the same amount as last year rose to 39% from 33% a year earlier.    Some retail experts, however, say the outlook could improve later this month after people stop worrying about the presidential election. George Bush's victory is generally viewed as a positive sign for sales, since shoppers are less likely to be fretting about policy changes that could affect their personal finances.    Retailers also could benefit from a quirk of the calendar that adds two more shopping days than last year to the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Thi could push more sales into December and depress November's results a bit. But the additional shopping days are likely to encourage consumers to spend more overall than they might have otherwise, according to William Burrows, corporate-research director at Carter Hawley Hale. &quot;Every year, when there is an extra selling day before Christmas, you do get some extra sales,&quot; he says.    Fiscal fourth-quarter sales also could be aided by the fact that Christmas and New Year's Day fall on Sundays this year. Mr. Hawley of Carter Hawley Hale points out that most people don't have to work the day after each holiday, meaning they are free to shop all day. &quot;The calendar this year,&quot; he says, &quot;is probably the most favorable one we get.&quot;    ---                Christmas Retailing Gains                                  INFLATION                    ACTUAL           RATE            REAL -    1981             6.7%            5.2%           + 1.5%    1982             4.2             2.6            + 1.6    1983            13.1             2.5            +10.6    1984             8.8             3.5            + 5.3    1985             6.9             2.6            + 4.3    1986             7.9             1.3            + 6.6    1987             7.0             4.5            + 2.5    1988 Est.        6.6             4.0            + 2.5   Source: Commerce Department fourth-quarter sales figures for general merchandise, apparel and furniture stores; estimates by Management Horizons</TEXT></DOC>
