The nation's 3,048 savings institutions lost $7.5 billion in thefirst six months of this year and losses almost surely will toplast year's post-Depression record of $7.8 billion.   An estimated 4,050 delegates and spouses to the U.S. League ofSavings Institutions' 96th annual convention have gathered in thepalm-ringed luxury hotels along Waikiki Beach to map strategy for1989, when Congress likely will make decisions affecting theindustry for years to come.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the industry,estimates the cost of restoring all Sandamp;Ls to solvency at $45 billionto $50 billion, but private analysts put the price tag as high as$100 billion.   Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall, scheduled to address theconvention on Thursday, said his agency will have enough money todo the job, but only if thrift institutions are charged a specialassessment for deposit insurance for the next 30 years.   Sandamp;Ls say they can't afford it and are looking to Congress tocome up with the additional money.   ``It's a 30-year mortgage we just flat out can't handle,'' saidTheo H. Pitt Jr., chairman of Pioneer Savings Bank in Rocky Mount,N.C., and outgoing chairman of the industry group.   The bank board this year has shut down more than 135institutions or merged them with stronger partners, but at midyear,497 insolvent institutions were still open. Another 408 weresolvent but losing money.   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., financed byassessments on the industry, was set up to insure deposits in Sandamp;Lsbut it has been weakened by the flurry of failures. Sandamp;Ls alreadypay more than twice as much for deposit insurance as commercialbanks _ $2.08 cents per $1,000 of deposits for Sandamp;Ls compared with83 cents for banks.   Pitt contends that continuing the extra assessment, originallyscheduled to be phased out in three years, would push otherwiseprofitable institutions into insolvency, creating an ever-enlargingproblem.   So far this year, the extra assessment has made the differencebetween profit and loss for 69 institutions, he said.   ``Clearly there is a limit to what the solvent institutions cando,'' he said.   Congress, when it decides how to pay the bill, whether through adirect appropriation from the Treasury or through some sort oftaxpayer-backed guarantee, will almost certainly include measuresaimed at preventing the problem from recurring.   Although much of the industry's problems are concentrated indepressed oil-producing states in the Southwest, they have beenmagnified in Texas, California and Florida by lax state regulationthat permitted thrift institutions to make risky investments farremoved from traditional home mortgage lending.   Many in the industry had pushed for permission to diversify inthe early 1980s when soaring interest rates made it impossible forthrifts to make money on their old, fixed-rate mortgages. Theargument was that a greater range of activities would helpinstitutions pull themselves out of the hole.   As it turned out, Pitt said, the institutions that strayed mostfrom traditional mortgage lending earned the least.   ``The ones that have gotten into trouble were the ones who tookthe most advantage of the new powers,'' he said.   Rep. Gerald Kleczka, D-Wis., and other members of Congress saythat after all the insolvent Sandamp;Ls are closed or merged withstronger partners, the entire Sandamp;L system should be merged with thecommercial bank system.   But Pitt says American home buyers need a separate Sandamp;L system.   A study by the U.S. League this summer showed that thrifts andmortgage banking companies owned by thrifts provided 54 percent ofthe country's residential mortgages last year.   ``I believe Congress is beginning to recognize that we haven'tabandoned our traditional role,'' Pitt said. ``If we don't do it,you're going to have to reinvent the system.   He said the league will be recommending regulatory changes inwhat he called a ``never again scenario.'' Among the likelyrecommendations, he said, would be stricter limits on directinvestment in commercial real estate projects and on the amountthat can be loaned to a single customer.</TEXT></DOC>
