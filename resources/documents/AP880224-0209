Richard Gephardt echoed a George Wallace refrain onWednesday, saying there is ``hardly a dime's worth of difference''between his chief Democratic presidential rivals on economicissues. Republican Sen. Bob Dole sought to slice into VicePresident George Bush's Southern support.   Gephardt blistered Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Albert GoreJr., while a fourth Democrat announced he would not compete in thedelegate-rich round of primaries known as Super Tuesday on March 8.Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, reeling after a spate of poor finishes,insisted he would remain in the race but conceded he lacked themoney to compete across the South.   Among the Republicans, former television evangelist PatRobertson said his Christian Broadcasting Network once knew thewhereabouts of the American hostages in Lebanon and suggested theycould have been rescued.   The assertion drew a tart response from the White House, wherespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Why didn't he tell us where theywere?''   It was the second startling comment in as many days fromRobertson. He suggested on Tuesday that Bush's campaign aides werebehind the recent public disclosure of television evangelist JimmySwaggert's sexual misconduct, and said they timed the disclosure tomake life difficult for another television evangelist running forpresident.   Bush denied that charge anew, saying, ``I'd like to see anapology or proof.''   The vice president shrugged off Dole's solid victories Tuesdaynight in the South Dakota primary and Minnesota caucuses, saying,``You can't win them all.'' He made a flying tour through NewEngland, where he hopes to win the Maine caucuses over the weekendand the Vermont primary next Tuesday.   But those events _ one in a state where the vice president ownsa home and the other that has no bearing on the hunt for conventiondelegates _ drew little attention from the rest of the field.   Instead, other eyes turned to Dixie, which is hosting most ofthe 20 Democratic and 17 Republican contests that will be held on asingle day on March 8.   Dole campaigned in South Carolina with Sen. Strom Thurmond athis side, and said he supports legislation on textile imports thatis popular in the state.   ``I recognize that I've got to catch up,'' he said. ``But webelieve there is some momentum'' after his twin wins in SouthDakota and Minnesota.   Even so, a fresh poll showed just how far Dole has to go.   The Denver Post survey of Southern voters showed Bush favored by54 percent of Republicans most likely to vote on March 8, with Dolefavored by 33 percent. And the Dole forces said their prospectswere particularly bleak in Texas, which offers the biggest singlecache of Super Tuesday delegates.   Dukakis was a narrower favorite in the Democratic survey, at 26percent, with Gore at 18 percent, Jesse Jackson at 16 percent, andGephardt at 12 percent. The poll was conducted Feb. 19-21 among 759registered voters in 13 Southern states.   But if Gephardt's speech in Waco, Texas, was any indication, thefight for the region's hundreds of delegates will be intense.   He said Gore and Dukakis seem committed to ``nothing more thanredecorating the facade of the status quo.'' He charged that theapproach both men have taken to the federal deficit problem``invites a post-election round of income tax increases and federalcuts in Medicare and Social Security.''   ``On the central economic issues of this campaign, there ishardly a dime's worth of difference between Gov. Dukakis and Sen.Gore,'' said Gephardt.   He also ridiculed Dukakis's foreign policy experience, saying itconsists ``almost entirely of negotiating with the governor of NewHampshire over the issue of nuclear power.''   The ``dime's worth of difference'' phrase was a reminder offormer Alabama Gov. Wallace's third party campaign theme of 1968,when he used it to sneer at the major party nominees.   Dukakis' initial response was made by campaign aide Leslie Dach.   ``We welcome a comparison of the candidates' records but firstwe need to know which of Dick Gephardt's records he's talkingabout,'' he said.   ``Mike Dukakis is the only candidate in this race who's balancedbudgets, put people back to work and lowered taxes five times infive years.''   There was no immediate response from Gore, who ridiculed Dukakisand Gephardt as ``two peas in a pod... I don't see either one ofthem to stand out as a principal challenger.'' Gore has based hiscandidacy on making a strong showing in his native South.   Simon announced his scaled-back campaign at a news conference inWashington, saying, ``There's no sense in fooling myself'' abouthis chances for success in the South.   Simon said he would concentrate on the primary in his home stateof Illinois on March 15 and the states that follow. But withoutprospects for delegates from the Super Tuesday states, his chanceof winning the nomination appeared non-existent.   Republican also-ran Jack Kemp vowed he would stay the course,despite two more disappointing finishes in Minnesota and SouthDakota.   Kemp's campaign has been victimized by Robertson's emergence asa strong contender in the early caucus states. ``I needed to breakup the idea that this is a Bush-Dole race,'' he said. ``This is nolonger a Bush-Dole race.''</TEXT></DOC>
