Among those freed was Kim Keun-tae, who recently was awarded theRobert F. Kennedy Award for Human Rights. He was sentenced in 1986to five years imprisonment for inciting unrest. International humanrights groups campaigned for his release.   The political prisoners were paroled from prisons throughout thecountry along with 453 common criminals, the ministry said.   ``The political offenders were released in line with thegovernment's continuing efforts to promote democracy in anatmosphere of national harmony,'' it said in a statement.   The statement said Kim and 45 other political prisoners weregranted parole because they had repented for what they had done andpromised not to violate the law again.   Justice Ministry officials indicated the government would freemore political prisoners in the future if they ``are eligible forparole and show repentance.''   Despite the government's announcement Wednesday that it wouldrelease the prisoners, opposition leaders charged that many moredissidents remained behind bars.   ``How can we talk about reconciliation and political developmentwhile keeping in prison those patriots, numbering more than 600,who fought for democracy?'' opposition leader Kim Dae-jung told theNational Assembly.   Kim Dae-jung also urged the government to punish formerPresident Chun Doo-hwan and his family for alleged corruption andconfiscate their property.   He demanded the government meet its promise of full democracyand accused President Roh Tae-woo of failing to carry out somepromised reforms.   Some opposition groups claim that 1,000 people are behind barsbecause of their political beliefs or opposition to the government.The government contends jailed dissidents committed violent crimesor broke national seurity laws.   About 20 relatives of prisoners demonstrated Wednesday outsidethe headquarters of the governing Democratic Justice Party todemand the release of all prisoners. Police arrested and held theprotesters, but later released them.   Riot police sealed off roads leading to Seoul's Roman Catholiccathedral Wednesday and stopped dissidents trying to take part in amarch to Chun's home in western Seoul. A handful of people tried toattend the rally but were blocked by police.   The Korean news agency, Yonhap, said about 9,000 riot policewere deployed across the capital to stop the march. About 20students who sneaked past police lines hurled firebombs and rocksat police from the cathedral compound, but authorities did notrespond.   ``Punish Chun!'' and ``Drive out Yankees!'' the studentsshouted, but passersby ignored the calls or urged protesters not touse violence.   Chun, who stepped down in February after a seven-year term, hasbeen accused of corruption and brutality against dissidents duringhis authoritarian administration.   Justice Ministry officials said Thursday's release left only 81political offenders in prison on anti-government charges. Therealso are about 480 people awaiting trial for political offenses,they said.   Included in the release were 11 South Koreans from Japan chargedwith spying for North Korea. The 11, who had resided in Japan, werearrested while visiting Seoul and other parts of the country in thelate 1970s.   The release coincided with the first anniversary of the ``granddeclaration for democracy'' by President Roh on June 29, 1987. Thedeclaration accepted most opposition demands for sweepingdemocratic reforms.   Roh's declaration, issued in the midst of nationwideanti-government demonstrations, paved the way for the country toadopt a new constitution and hold the first direct presidentialelections in 16 years.   Roh, running as the government candidate, beat the dividedopposition in the Dec. 16 elections. He then pledged to bring fulldemocracy to South Korea.</TEXT></DOC>
