To implyotherwise (as in your reference to the Pennsylvania family)is misleading and inaccurate. Should people also be&quot;compensated&quot; if they can't build in a non-wetland for onereason or another, such as local zoning restrictions? Ifcompensation is allowed, I envision a scenario whereby adeveloper could apply for a permit to build in a wetland forthe sole purpose of cashing in on &quot;compensation&quot; (sort oflike a new savings-and-loan crisis).</LP><TEXT>   Our office has been involved with the Clean Water Actsince its inception in 1972. I believe the act has been onlypartially successful in achieving the goals against waterpollution envisioned by Congress. However, we have neverachieved the president's goal of &quot;no net loss&quot; of wetlands inPennsylvania in spite of us &quot;bureaucrats&quot; striving to protectthe public interest. Since only about 2% of Pennsylvania isclassified as wetlands, it would seem to me that the other98% provides plenty of room for development.   Charles J. Kulp   Supervisor   Fish and Wildlife Service   U.S. Department of the Interior   State College, Pa.   ---   You admirably covered much of the debate created bycapricious regulation of wetlands by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency and the Corps of Engineers.   The controversy over wetland regulation is a hot issue inthe Midwest. The Corn Belt was once the nation's largestwetland. Development of these ancient wetlands has been thefuel of economic prosperity in the U.S. Altering wetlands toa more productive use has created a multibillion-dollarindustry in the nation's heartland, allowed for the growth ofcities such as Chicago, which is built on a wetland, and madethe U.S. the largest supplier of food to a hungry world.   Now we see the federal government trying to turn back theclock of progress.   Whereas landowners and businesses have to contend with thetwo regulators noted in your editorial, agriculture has tocontend with the Soil Conservation Service, the Fish andWildlife Service, and a host of other federal and stateagencies all wanting their piece of the wetland regulatorypie. These agencies have all assumed some margin of authorityover farmer-owned wetlands.   The Soil Conservation Service has been charged withidentifying wetlands on farmland. To show the extent of theproblem, in this county alone (Pike County, Ill.) the servicehas identified wetlands on 70% of farm tracts.   Because of the broad definition and methodology developedby four federal agencies, spots in the middle of farmedground as small as one-hundredth of an acre have beenidentified as a wetland. Other instances show wetlands asbeing land farmed for generations, drainage ditches, grassedwaterways, wooded hills, gullies, fence lines,erosion-control structures, homesites, power poles and otherobviously non-wet areas. If common sense were the standardused in identifying wetlands instead of pseudo-science, noneof these areas would have been listed as a wetland.   Private-property rights granted in the Fifth Amendment arebeing abridged by government in order to satisfy somepolitically expedient environmental craving. The governmentapparently feels that wetlands, even those that have beenfarmed for more than a hundred years, are now in the publicdomain. This battle over wetlands has importantconstitutional, political and economic ramifications. It mustnot be won by those bent on trampling private-propertyrights.
