Whether insurers areliable for costs associated with gradual pollution has beenthe subject of extensive litigation in the nation.   The decision marks the first time Wisconsin's highestcourt has interpreted a key provision in standard commercialliability insurance policies, known as &quot;the pollutionexclusion.&quot; The provision hasn't been used widely since 1986.</LP><TEXT>   Insurers have contended that under the provisionpolicyholders are not covered for damages arising frompollution that was released gradually into the environment.Policyholders counter that they are entitled to coverageunder the provision as long as they didn't intentionallycause or expect the pollution.   The Wisconsin dispute involves a suit filed by 120property owners who reside near a landfill site operated byLand Reclamation Ltd., a landfill operator in Racine. Theresidents allege that Land Reclamation violated environmentallaws in its operation of the site, resulting in watercontamination, decreased property values, and unpleasantodors. Land Reclamation denies the charges.   The residents sued the company and its insurer, BituminousCasualty Corp., seeking $9.6 million in compensation forproperty damage. A lower court dismissed the case againstBituminous, a subsidiary of Chicago-based Old RepublicInternational. Land Reclamation appealed the decision.   In a 6-1 decision, the state Supreme Court found that themeaning of the &quot;pollution exclusion&quot; was ambiguous and mustbe interpreted in favor of the policyholder. The court alsoordered Bituminous to pay Land Reclamation's legal costs.   In a dissent, Judge Donald W. Steinmetz said the court'sdecision means that an insurance policy &quot;now becomes a deeppocket to pay for business mistakes.&quot;   In a ruling that clashes with the Wisconsin decision, theMassachusetts Supreme Court last week found that the&quot;pollution exclusion&quot; bars coverage for gradual pollution.   Peter Lardner, president of Bituminous, said the companyhasn't yet decided whether to appeal. &quot;This continuing seriesof conflicting court decisions contributes to more confusionbetween customers and companies,&quot; he said.   &quot;It was important for us to know that we now haveinsurance coverage,&quot; said Joe Muratore, a Racine lawyer forLand Reclamation.   Allan D. Krezminski of Schoone Ware Fortune andamp; Leuck inRacine, a lawyer for the residents, said the decision mayspur settlement negotiations.   ---   INSIDER-TRADING CASE against Kidder, Peabody to proceed.   A state court judge in Dallas denied Kidder, Peabody andamp;Co.'s request to dismiss most of the claims filed against theinvestment banking firm by Dallas-based Maxus Energy Corp.   Maxus Energy, formerly Diamond Shamrock Corp., allegesthat it paid more than it should have in its 1983 acquisitionof Natomas Co. because inside information was passed byformer Kidder investment banker Martin A. Siegel toarbitrager Ivan F. Boesky.   Kidder Peabody, contending that it knew nothing of thealleged insider trading, won a ruling in mid-April from a NewYork federal judge that the banking firm wasn't liable toMaxus for damages.   Kidder cited the New York ruling last week when it arguedbefore state District Judge Adolph Canales of Dallas thatmost of Maxus's claims should be dismissed.   But Judge Canales ruled this week that Maxus's caseagainst Kidder could proceed. The judge didn't give anyreason for his ruling. An attorney for Kidder declined tocomment on the decision.   The case won't be scheduled for trial until after Oct. 1to allow Mr. Boesky to testify, if needed, at the sentencingof Michael Milken, former head of junk bonds at DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.   ---   DEFENSE LAWYERS predict Panama will not thwart a pact onNoriega's legal fees.   Just as the U.S. reached an agreement that ended atwo-month squabble over legal fees for the deposed dictator,the government of Panama has piped up, saying Panama shouldhave first claim to any unfrozen funds.   Defense attorneys say they aren't worried, even though anattorney for the Panamanian government, Gregory Craig, saidhe intends to file civil suits against Mr. Noriega for morethan $5 billion for a host of alleged misdeeds, includingmurder.   Judge William M. Hoeveler indicated he will give priorityto Mr. Noriega's right to a fair trial over any civil claims.Thus, the defense is confident the judge won't entertain anyrequests to take away Mr. Noriega's kitty for legal fees.   In an interview, Judge Hoeveler acknowledged that Panamacould petition foreign governments to freeze the accounts,just as the U.S. did. &quot;Where the money is out of the countryand controlled by a foreign entity, it may be entirely out ofmy hands,&quot; he said.   However, while Panama could itself seek to freeze theaccounts, the defense lawyers doubt the government of Panamawould do anything to aggravate the U.S., which has finallycome through with funds to rebuild the battered country.   &quot;Panama could ask foreign governments not to unfreeze theaccounts,&quot; says Jon May, an attorney for Mr. Noriega. &quot;But ifit's not in the interest of the U.S., it may not be in theinterest of Panama to do it.&quot;   Frank A. Rubino, another defense attorney, described theappearance in court Wednesday by Mr. Craig, an attorney withthe Washington, D.C., law firm of Williams andamp; Connolly, as&quot;grandstanding.&quot;   Mr. Craig couldn't be reached for comment.   ---   JUDGE ACCUSED of conflicts will continue to hearCalifornia antitrust case.   A Los Angeles federal judge ruled that U.S. District JudgeWilliam L. Gray can preside over a multimillion-dollarantitrust case involving six big oil companies.   Earlier this year, attorneys for the plaintiffs hadrequested that Judge Gray recuse himself from the casebecause of various alleged conflicts of interest. Among otherthings, the attorneys noted that the judge's wife held 10shares of stock in Chevron Corp., a defendant in the case.   The 78-year old judge, who has presided over the casesince its inception in 1975, refused to step down. FederalJudge Robert M. Takasugi this week denied the plaintiffs'motion to disqualify the judge on the condition that Mrs.Gray sell the Chevron stock.   Judge Gray said the shares were sold the day before theruling. &quot;I'm delighted that it's over,&quot; he said. &quot;I was verymuch embarrassed about the motion which challenged myimpartiality and integrity. My reputation has beenvindicated.&quot;   In the case, the city of Long Beach and the state ofCalifornia allege that the six companies conspired to payartificially low prices to the state and city for oilproduced from state-owned tidelands. Among the defendants areUnocal Corp., Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group's ShellOil Co. unit, Exxon Corp. and Texaco Inc.   Gary Hoecker, a Los Angeles attorney for Long Beach, said:&quot;We will decide Friday whether to abide by Judge Takasugi'sruling or to appeal.&quot;   ---   Martha Brannigan and Ann Hagedorn contributed to thiscolumn.</TEXT></DOC>
