Commonwealth Edison said such an order, if upheld in court, would cut 1989 earnings by about $1.40 a share. Last year the utility earned $737.5 million, or $3.01 a share.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Commonwealth Edison shares closed at $37.50, down 62.5 cents.    The Illinois regulators directed a hearing examiner to prepare a formal order saying Commonwealth Edison overspent by $189.6 million on the $2.5 billion plant, completed in 1985. In a 1985 ruling, the commission disallowed an additional $101 million of Byron 1 construction expenses. The seven-member panel is expected to vote on the latest proposed disallowance soon.    The commission's action pleased neither side in the long-running battle over the Byron 1 plant. Both the utility and consumer advocates said they planned to seek a new hearing from the commission and pledged to appeal the decision in court if necessary.    A Commonwealth Edison spokesman called the proposed disallowance &quot;excessive and unfair&quot; and said, &quot;We think we've built a very efficient and low-cost nuclear plant.&quot; Howard Learner, associate general counsel for Business andamp; Professional People for the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy law firm that has challenged the cost of Byron 1, said consumers were &quot;entitled to a substantially larger refund than this.&quot;    The controversy centers on a study last year by Arthur Young andamp; Co., which was hired by the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison's Byron 1 expenses. The auditors criticized Commonwealth Edison for failing to control adequately Byron 1's construction costs and found that the plant took 16 months too long to complete, raising its cost by $409 million.    But the auditors also found that Edison customers benefited by the delay because the utility saved money on such related items as coal contracts for plants that Byron 1 would have replaced. Such savings, the auditors estimated, reduced the overrun to between $133 million and $169 million.    Utility critics say Commonwealth Edison should pay for most of the $409 million overrun, while the company contends it shouldn't pay any extra charge.    The commission's apparent willingness to compromise between those two positions could have considerable impact on the cases of three other Commonwealth Edison nuclear plants that will be decided next year. Stephen Moore, who heads the Illinois Public Counsel's Office, the state's consumer agency, said Commonwealth Edison could end up losing hundreds of millions of dollars in customer revenue if the commission takes a similar compromise position on the three other nuclear plants. </TEXT></DOC>
