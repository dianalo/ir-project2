L. 95-91, the functions of the Secretary of the Interior andthe Federal Power Commission under section 5 of the Flood Control Act of1944, 16 U.S.C. 825s, for the Southwestern Power Administration were transferredto and vested and the Secretary of Energy. By Delegation Order No. 0204-33,effective January 1, 1979, 43 FR 60636 (December 28, 1978), the Secreataryof Energy delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Resource Applicationsthe authority to develop power and transmission rates, acting by and throughthe Administrator, and to confirm, approve and place into effect such rateson an interim basis, and delegated to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissionthe authority to confirm and approve on a final basis or to disapproverates developed by the Assistant Secretary under the delegation. Due toa Department of Energy organizational realignment, Delegation Order No.0204-33 was amended, effective March 19, 1981, to transfer the authorityof the Assistant Secretary for Resource Applications to the Assistant Secretaryfor Conservation and Renewable Energy. By Delegation Order No. 0204-108,effective December 14, 1983, 48 FR 55664 (December 14, 1983) the Secretaryof Energy delegated to the Deputy Secretary of Energy on a non-exclusivebasis the authority to confirm, approve and place into effect on an interimbasis power and transmission rates, and delegated to the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission on an exclusive basis the authority to confirm, approveand place in effect on a final basis, or to disapprove power and transmissionrates. Amendment No. 1 to Delegation Order No. 0204-108, effective May30, 1986, 51 FR 19744 (May 30, 1986), revised the delegation of authorityto confirm, approve and place into effect on an interim basis power andtransmission rates by delegating such authority to the Under Secretaryof Energy rather than the Deputy Secretary of Energy. This rate order isissued pursuant to the delegation to the Under Seretary of Energy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The existing annual Sam Rayburn Dam power rate of $1,715,040 has been ineffect since confirmed and approved on a final basis by the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission (FERC) for the period October 1, 1986, through September30, 1990. The 1987 Sam Rayburn Dam Current Power Repayment Study indicatesthat the rate is no longer adequate to satisfy cost recovery criteria forthe isolated project. The 1987 Sam Rayburn Dam Revised Power RepaymentStudy indicates that an annual rate of $1,810,368 will be required to repaythe project's investment and annual costs in accordance with Departmentof Energy Order No. RA 6120.2 and section 5 of the Flood Control Act of1944. The proposed increase in revenue amounts to $95,328, or 5.6 percentannually and will begin July 1, 1988, in accordance with Title 10, Part903, Subpart A of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR 903), ``Proceduresfor Public Participation in Power and Transmission Rate Adjustments andExtensions'' (50 FR 37837). SWPA published notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>November 18, 1987, (52 FR 44217) announcing a90-day period for public review and comment concerning the proposed rateadjustment as required by 10 CFR 903. By letter dated November 17, 1987,SWPA mailed a preliminary copy of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice and supporting data for the 1987 PowerRepayment Studies to the customer for information and review. A publicinformation forum was held on December 15, 1987, followed by a public commentforum on January 12, 1988. Oral comments were received on behalf of theSam Rayburn Dam Electric Cooperative and were supported by written commentsreceived by letter dated February 8, 1988. Based on the date of publication,written comments from the customer and interested parties were acceptedthrough February 16, 1988, and are contained along with SWPA's responsesin the Comments and Responses Section of this Rate Order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The 1987 Current Power Repayment Study tests the adequacy of the existingrate based on the latest cost evaluation period extending from FY 1988through FY 1991. The 1987 Repayment Study that was made available for publiccomment was based on a cost evaluation period extending from FY 1987 throughFY 1991. Since that time, actual data for FY 1987 has been incorporatedin the 1987 Repayment Study, which has had some effect on future estimates.With actual data for FY 1987, the cost evaluation period now extends fromFY 1988 through FY 1991. This study is an update of the 1986 Power RepaymentStudy which was based on a cost evaluation period of FY 1986 through FY1990. The most significant difference in the two studies results from extendingthe cost evaluation period the additional year and updating costs to currentlevels. The Schedule of Significant Changes and Comparison of PreviousForecast with Actual Results and Present Forecast of the 1987 Power RepaymentStudy compares the 1986 and 1987 Studies.SWPA continues to make significant progress toward repayment of the Federalinvestment in the Sam Rayburn Dam. Through FY 1987, repayment status forthe Sam Rayburn Dam Project is $5,540,871, which represents approximately23 percent of the $23,822,361 Federal investment in the project. The statusof repayment has increased almost 18 percent above the $4,537,000 notedby the FERC in their Order issued March 13, 1987.The FERC also previously indicated an interest in SWPA's progress towardrepayment as compared to various amortization methods which assume scheduledpayments without ever falling behind. SWPA has prepared an analysis whichindicates that under such a scheduled compound interest amortization methodSWPA would have repaid approximately 23 percent of the Federal investmentthrough FY 1987. The 1987 Power Repayment Study shows that Sam RayburnDam repayment status will reach the level of the scheduled compound interestamortization method by the end of FY 1988. As an additional matter of interest,SWPA's financial records indicate that through FY 1987, amortization forthe project exceeds accumulated depreciation of $2,215,434 (based on compoundinterest depreciation and an average service life exceeding 80 years) by$3,325,437.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments andamp; Responses</ITAG>The Southwestern Power Administration received one written reply concerningthe notice published in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> November 18, 1987, announcing the proposed SamRayburn Dam power rate increase.Comment:By letter dated February 8, 1988, Sam Rayburn Dam Electric Cooperative,Inc., (SRDEC) expressed no opposition or objection to the implementationof the proposed annual rate of $1,810,368 for the sale of power and energyfrom Sam Rayburn Dam. SRDEC expressed their concern that the Corps Oandamp;Mexpenses comprise a major portion of the rate increase and there is littlesupporting detail on how the Corps of Engineers arrive at their estimate.Response:The Southwestern Power Administration continues to work closely with theCorps of Engineers in preparing estimates of Oandamp;M expenses. The Oandamp;Mestimates prepared by the Corps of Engineers appear to have been relativelyconsistent with actual expenses incurred.The Sam Rayburn Dam Electric Cooperative has proposed that a working group,comprised of the Corps of Engineers, Sam Rayburn Dam Electric Cooperativeand Southwestern Power Administration, meet to discuss issues of mutualinterest related to the Sam Rayburn Dam. SWPA fully supports this proposaland will be scheduling a meeting in the near future.Availability of InformationInformation regarding this rate proposal including studies, comments andother supporting material, is available for public review and comment inthe offices of the Southwestern Power Administration, 333 West 4th, Tulsa,Oklahoma 74103.Administrator's CertificationThe 1987 Revised Sam Rayburn Dam Power Repayment Study indicates that theincreased annual Sam Rayburn Dam power rate of $1,810,368 will repay allcosts of the project including amortization of the power investment consistentwith provisions of Department of Energy Order No. RA 6120.2. In accordancewith section 1 of Delegation Order No. 0204-108, as amended May 30, 1986(51 FR 19744), the Administrator has determined that the proposed Sam RayburnDam power rate is consistent with applicable law and is the lowest possiblerate consistent with sound business principles in accordance with section5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944.EnvironmentThe environmental impact of the proposed Sam Rayburn Dam power rate hasbeen analyzed in consideration of the Department of Energy ``EnvironmentalCompliance Guide''. The amount of the proposed increase does not warrantan Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement in accordancewith these regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>In view of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority delegated to meby the Secretary of Energy, I hereby confirm, approve and place in effecton an interim basis, effective July 1, 1988, the proposed annual rate of$1,810,368 for the sale of power and energy from Sam Rayburn Dam to SamRayburn Dam Electric Cooperative, Inc., under Contract No. 14-02-0001-1124,as amended November 1, 1980.
