London stocks were mixed, but an index closed at a record.    In Hong Kong Thursday, the colony's two note-issuing banks cut their prime lending rates to 5% from 6.5%. The reduction, the first since August, was intended to stem speculation on the Hong Kong dollar. The value of the Hong Kong dollar rose to 7.7525 Wednesday, the strongest since it was linked to the U.S. dollar in 1983.    In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average, which on Tuesday fell 124.97 points, increased 240.22 points yesterday, or 1.3%, to 18784.27. The stock exchange index, which fell 11.44 points Tuesday, rose 34.11 points, or 2.2%, to 1591.57.    Volume surged to 900 million shares from 380 million shares Tuesday.    The dollar continued to fall sharply against the Japanese yen yesterday. The U.S. currency's weakness earlier this week caused stocks to fall in Tokyo; as the dollar declines against the yen, Japanese exports become more expensive in the U.S. But yesterday, stocks benefited because the dollar's decline sparked rumors that Japan's central bank will cut its discount rate.    Investors speculated that the rate, which the central bank charges on loans to financial institutions, would be lowered to counter the harm that the weakening dollar causes Japan's slumping, export-driven economy. Moreover, an interest-rate cut in Japan might cause the dollar to rise against the yen. Lower interest rates tend to weaken a currency because they reduce the returns available from investments denominated in that currency.    Investment trusts were active stock buyers yesterday. Foreign investors bought shares of export-oriented companies, taking advantage of those shares' declines over the prior two sessions.    The Tokyo exchange is closed today for a Japanese national holiday.    In London, the Financial Times industrial share index fell 4.9 points, to 1389.0. But the broader Financial Times 100-share index rose 1.9 points, to a record 1765.2.    Brokers described yesterday's session as a correction that had been expected following the market's strong gains recently. The market still appears &quot;pretty good,&quot; a broker said.    The gold mines index rose 9.2 points, to 335.5.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                       % This                               Jan. 13     Jan. 12     Year   U.S. ....................... 244.1       244.6    + 21.4   Britain .................... 525.5       522.7    + 26.1   Canada ..................... 354.7       354.1    + 13.0   Japan ...................... 940.8       947.4    + 57.0   France ..................... 420.9       422.4    + 54.7   Germany .................... 239.2       243.3    -  3.0   Hong Kong ................. 1797.7      1814.5    + 51.9   Switzerland ................ 199.0       199.4    +  2.5   Australia .................. 278.1       278.0    + 49.8   World index ................ 372.2       372.1    + 45.1</TEXT></DOC>
