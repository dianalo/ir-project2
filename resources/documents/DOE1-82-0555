In the present study, weused receptor autoradiography to map the distribution of nicotinic [{sup3}H]acetylcholine binding sites in cortices of individuals with AD andPD and matched control subjects. In both diseases, a profound loss ofnicotinic receptors occurs in all cortical layers, particularly the deepestlayers.</TEXT></DOC>
