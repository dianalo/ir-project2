(AMS) had completed morethan 500 integration projects for 40 of the 50 largest U.S.andP;  banks, five ofthe 10 largest insurance companies, more than 90 federal agencies and morethan 50 of the Fortune 100 companies.andP;  But the $225 million, 2,800-employeecompany wasn't satisfied.andP;  AMS wanted to increase the number of telcomvendors on its client roster.andM;So, last year, AMS launched an all-out assault on the telecommunicationsmarket.andP;  It put the finishing touches on its TieLine family of billing,administrative and clientinterface software developed for telecommunicationscompanies.andP;  Customization of the TieLine system for individual customers is akey component of the integration services that AMS currently offers topotential telecommunications clients.andM;With TieLine, AMS managed to win a spot as subcontractor to IBM Corp. on an$11.5 million contract with Contel Corp. for installation of its newautomated-billing system.andP;  It sold similar TieLine-based systems to US Sprintand Pacific Telecom Inc.andM;AMS also formed a joint venture with Bell Atlantic Corp. to create BellAtlantic Systems Integration Corp. The venture has won several approximately$1 million projects.andM;Simultaneously, AMS hasn't neglected other vertical niches in which it hassold its integration services since 1970.andP;  These are: financial services,state and local government, higher education and the federal government.andP;  AMSderives about 75 percent to 80 percent of its integration revenues fromcommercial contracts and the rest from federal integration contracts.andM;&quot;We stress our understanding of the business problems faced by particularverticals,&quot; explains Patrick Gross, vice chairman and one of the threefounders of AMS.andM;And AMS emphasizes its horizontal areas of expertise, including CASE (via itsown life-cycle productivity system-LPS), document imaging, expert systems,cooperative processing and integration involving IBM's Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA).andM;&quot;There's no question that we've barely sctatched the surface of these newtechnologies,&quot; says Gross.andP;  &quot;Sometimes customers are enlightened about them,but usually we have to educate them about these technologies' benefits.andO;However, once we sell them on an idea, we're extremely well-positioned tosell them the required integration services.&quot;andM;In order to address such a wide range of markets and technologies, AMSpartners on an ad hoc basis with other major integrators, such as ElectronicData Systems Corp. (in higher education) and Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. (in thepublic sector).andP;  And as an IBM Business Partner-and a company in which IBMowns a 10 percent equity stake- AMS works closely with Big Blue to providesolutions across the board.andP;  It offers all of its customers the entire gamutof integration services, ranging from consulting and implementation toeducation and a limited amount of facilities management.andM;AMS maintains consistency in the type of customer it targets.andP;  With theexception of a brief attempt to sell to small companies in its early years,AMS sticks with doing midsized projects ($1 million to $10 million range) forthe world's largest companies.andM;Ranking: AMS is the No.andP;  4 banking and financial integrator and the No.andP;  14prime commercial integrator, according to G2.Mary Jo FoleyandM;When the Texas state legislature reconvenes in Austin next January, memberswill find computer terminals in legislative committee rooms and offices.andP;  Theterminals will be part of a $2.6 million decision-support system installed bythe Andersen Consulting division of Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.andM;This is the kind of high-visibility project that is driving a 30 percentannual growth rate for 2-year-old Andersen Consulting, spun off in October1988 as a separate division of the accounting concern.andM;U.S.andP;  integration jobs still account for the bulk of Andersen Consulting'srevenue.andP;  However, that is changing.andM;&quot;By the mid 1990s,&quot; according to John Oltman, Andersen Consulting's managingpartner for worldwide integration services, &quot;I see the international marketbeing bigger for us than the North American market.&quot;andM;Markets for systems integration are especially enticing in Eastern Europe.andO;But there's a danger when dealing with clients in the former Soviet empire:getting paid.andP;  Says Oltman, &quot;That is an issue, but I think that's a hurdlethat will be overcome.&quot;andM;The potential payoff is seen to be enormous.andP;  Oltman estimates that by 1995,the international systems integration business will be worth $100 billion, upfrom the $25 billion to $30 billion of today.andP;  &quot;The challenge is for AndersenConsulting to get positioned to respond,&quot; he says.andM;Although it's been a separate division for only two years, Andersen'sconsulting operation has been an independent business within the largercompany since 1980.andP;  The concern's revenue from consulting grew from $200million in 1980 to $1.4 billion in the last fiscal year.andP;  That figurerepresents better than 40 percent of Arthur Andersen's total revenues of $3.4billion.andM;Worldwide, Andersen Consulting operates 157 offices in 45 countries with18,000 employees, of whom 725 are called managing partners.andM;And Andersen has made its presence felt in a number of industries, fromretailing (at Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.) and heavy equipment (Caterpillar Inc.) toconsumer electronics (N.V.andP;  Philips).andM;Financial services is a major business area.andP;  The New York investment banker,Salomon Brothers, is using Andersen to redesign its information-deliverysystem.andP;  In addition, Andersen has designed and implemented trading systemsfor the  Swiss and German futures exchanges and for the Italian and Frenchstock exchanges.andM;Recently, Andersen Consulting established partnerships with vendors likeCodex Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. to pursue contracts in verticalmarkets.andP;  Andersen already has a $6 million value-added reseller (VAR)program with Hewlett-Packard Co. and is exploring a partnership with IBMCorp. Oltman predicts that these activities will continue.andP;  IBM,&quot; saysOltman, &quot;will end up being a considerable competitor and a considerablepartner.&quot;andM;Ranking: Andersen Consulting is the No.andP;  1 prime commercial integrator,manufacturing integrator and health-care integrator; the No.andP;  2 state andlocal government integrator, insurance integrator and banking and financialintegrator; and the No.andP;  3 telecommunications integrator, according to G2.andM;Even though ATandamp;T formally dissolved its commercial systems integration groupa few years ago, over time it has managed to increase the systems integrationpresence of nearlyall of its business units throughout the organization.andM;&quot;We've been a commercial systems integrator as long as we've been in thecomputer systems business [1984],&quot; claims Joel Appelbaum, current vicepresident at ATandamp;T's Unix software operation (USO) and former vice presidentof technical services and support for ATandamp;T's computer systems business.andP;  Thetechnical services unit coordinates just about all of ATandamp;T's commercialintegration work.andP;  Federal systems integration continues to be handled almostexclusively through ATandamp;T Federal Systems.)andM;Other ATandamp;T divisions, such as network systems and communications services,could justifiably make similar claims regarding their commercial systemsintegration tenacity.andP;  Together, the business units did nearly $100 millionin commercial systems integration work last year, according to ATandamp;T.andM;Despite corporate's decision to decentralize AT,andamp;T's systems integrationcapabilities, all business units have remained focused on common horizontaland vertical markets.andP;  ATandamp;T's No.andP;  I claim to systems fame continues to benetwork integration involving both its own and other vendors' local areanetworks (LANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs) and wide area networks(WANs).andM;But ATandamp;T is also touting its capacity to interconnect Unix with proprietaryoperating environments.andP;  &quot;We're an integrator in the networked-computingarena,&quot; Appelbaum says, &quot;with a focus on distributed applications as frontends to open and proprietary operating environments.&quot;andM;The company offers its integration customers the full range of services, fromsystem design to implementation, support and maintenance.andP;  Many times, ATandamp;Tbuilds solutions based on home-grown tools, such as its CASE prototypingoffering (Applications Connectivity Engineering, ACE) and itsoffice-automation architecture (Rhapsody).andM;Even though it carries the full line of ATandamp;T hardware and software, ATandamp;Tdoesn't suffer from the not-invented-here syndrome, maintains Appelbaum.andP;  &quot;Ifcustomers want Novell, we'll sell it to them, even though we have our owncompeting product, StarLAN,&quot; he says.andP;  ATandamp;T is in the midst of ironing outthe details of partnerships with other third-party integrators to provideadditional front-end consulting skills, Appelbaum adds.andM;ATandamp;T is aiming its integration tools and services at the financial,health-care, lodging, retail, telecommunications, and state and localgovemment industries.andP;  Its largest commercial contract to date is withAmerican Airlines, won last June (See SYSTEMS INTEGRATION, December 1989,Page 40).andP;  ATandamp;T will provide American Airlines with 80386based servers,workstations and LANs for the carrier's SABRE Travel Information Network.andO;But ATandamp;T has also racked up wins with Firestone, the Stanford Medical Centerand the New York Stock Exchange.andM;&quot;We're beginning to see significant repeat business now,&quot; Appelbaum says.andO;&quot;We expect our systems integration business to at least double every year forthe next 10 years.&quot; Ranking: ATandamp;T is the No.andP;  2 network integrator and theNo.andP;  7 state and local government integrator, according to G2.andP;  FoleyandM;The Boeing Co., through its Boeing Computer Services Inc. (BCS) subsidiary,garnered $1.5 billion in systems integration work in 1989, with a full 85percent attributable to federal jobs and 15  percent to commercial ones.andP;  Buta &quot;mere&quot; 15 percent in this case, totals $225 million, making BCS one of thelargest commercial integrators.andM;&quot;We expect the commercial percentage to go up a bit, but our focus willcontinue to be primarily the U.S.andP;  government,&quot; says Mike Little, vicepresident of information services at BCS.andP;  &quot;A significant element of ourstrategy is to take advantage of our presence, expertise and experience intelecommunications and network integration on the federal side and toleverage that to grow our commercial sales.&quot; Over the next five years, thefederal:commercial ratio at BCS will reach 75:25, Little predicts.andM;Besides telecommunications and networking, other commercial target areas forBCS include document-management systems involving image-processing andelectronic data interchange (EDI) technologies.andM;Far and away most of BCS' income comes from work it does for its parent, TheBoeing Co. (This year, 76 percent of BCS' total revenues came from Boeing.)andO;But over the next five years, according to company officials, that numberwill decline to 67 percent.andM;Outside of Boeing, NASA is BCS' largest customer.andP;  The kind of work BCS doesthere typifies why it is likely to remain a principal competitor in theintegration business.andM;In 1984, BCS won a contract to design, install and operate an integrateddigital network for NASA's business and engineering needs.andP;  Known as the NASAProgram Support Communications Network (PSCN), its hub is at the MarshallSpace Flight Center.andP;  The PSCN links 17 NASA centers and 100,000 usersnationwide.andP;  At each site, the PSCN is responsible for managing an average of13,000 telecommunications devices.andM;Other important capabilities of the PSCN include long-distance telephone,data, electronic mail, facsimile, video and voice teleconferencing;terrestrial and satellite transmission facilities; and transmission rates of1.5M bits per second.andP;  BCS has been responsible for coordinating the morethan 800 suppliers, subcontractors and vendors that have contributed to thePSCN.andP;  Two of these major subcontractors include General Electric Corp. andBrown Associates Management Services Inc. The 10-year PSCN contract is worth$500 million.andM;Ranking: BCS is the No.andP;  5 telecommunications integrator, the No.andP;  6image-processing integrator and the No.andP;  11 prime commercial integratorgovernment integrator, according to G2.andM;When you're a $1.3 billion, 13,000-employee international conglomerate thatis already one of the world's top systems integrators-as is CAP GEMINI SOGETI(CGS)-the ageold &quot;make vs.andP;  buy&quot; technology decision is clear-cut.andP;  If youneed expertise in a given area, you buy it.andM;That's what CGS has done in building its U.S.andP;  operating group, CAP GEMINIAMERICA (CGA).andP;  The Paris-based parent company has grown CGA into a $213million, 3,000-employee, 50-branch integration powerhouse by buying upsmaller integrators and professional-service companies.andM;Its first such acquisition was of management consultant GEMINI in 1975; itsmost recent were in 1989, when it bought Merit Systems Inc., a Detroit CIMspecialist and Systemation Inc., a Cleveland CASE and management-consultingcompany.andM;Result: CGA is well on its way to making the transition from contractprogramming shop to full-fledged systems integrator.andM;CGA's areas of specialization mirror those of CGS' various acquisitions.andO;These include: Unix development, system and application conversions, expertsystems and coupling/ decoupling of data systems (the process oflinking/extracating companies' data when they merge or go their separateways).andP;  CGA's largest targeted vertical markets are manufacturing,telecommunications and insurance.andP;  Federal jobs contribute less than 5percent of total revenues.andM;&quot;Our skill set matches what the market is demanding,&quot; says senior vicepresident, James Woodward.andP;  &quot;We support what our clients already have.andP;  Wesee our contribution as skills-driven.&quot;andM;When MONY Financial Services decided in 1986 to move its pension system froma Hewleff-Packard Co. 3000 platform to an IBM Corp. 3090, for example, itcontracted with CGA to provide conversion services.andP;  CGA handled not only thehardware transition but also the switch-overs of the operating system (MPE toMVS/XA), database (Turbo/Image to DB2), on-line facility (Inform to CICS) andprogramming language (HP BASIC to COBOL 11).andP;  The converted system wenton-line in 1988.andM;Like its parent company, CGA offers the range of systems integrationcapabilities from application planning to outsourcing.andP;  CASE services,including project management via its Project Quality System methodology, areamong CGA's biggest and best known selling points.andM;IBM recognized CGA's CASE capabilities last year, when it chose the companyas one of its four systems integration partners to aid customers in adheringto its A/D Cycle strategy.andP;  &quot;We help customers with cultural changes and thetransition process involved in moving to CASE,&quot; Woodward says.andP;  Ranking: CGAis the No.andP;  21 prime commercial integrator, according to G2.andM;When IBM Corp. decided to go into the systems integration business withComputer Task Group Inc. (CTG) in June 1989, it wanted more than just warmsmiles and friendly handshakes to cement the deal.andM;So, Big Blue bought $21 million worth of CTG stock, which is 15.3 percent ofCTG's outstanding stock.andP;  And IBM has an option to increase its holdings to19 percent.andM;But now, how open is CTG to reselling non-IBM equipment? Almost as open asbefore, claims Jack Courtney, CTG president.andP;  &quot;If a client comes to usdirectly and has an interest in a DEC (Digital Equipment Corp.) solution,we're under no requirement because of our relationship with IBM to talk himout of it.&quot;andM;Vincent S. Lamb Jr., president of CTG's systems integration subsidiaryScientific Systems Services (SSS), Melbourne, FL.andP;  adds, &quot;Probably two-thirdsof our business is nonIBM.andP;  IBM's share will increase with time, of course,but I don't expect us to be exclusively IBM-ever.&quot; He adds, &quot;Meanwhile, we'regetting a lot of advantages from IBM: training on IBM products and a wholelot of information about IBM's marketing plans.&quot;andM;It wasn't until 1987 that CTG won its first major systems integration job, a$2 5-million contract with USS-POSCO Industries, a joint venture ofconglomerates USX Corp. and Pohang Steel Co..andM;Now, three years later, Courtney forecasts that CTG's 1990 direct systemsintegration activities will bring in $35 million to $50 million.andP;  CTG expectsits worldwide revenue this year to be $250 million.andP;  Its other businessesinclude software development, education and training.andM;The partnership with IBM should account for about $25 million to $30 millionthis year, Courtney says, although not all of that will be from systemsintegration.andP;  &quot;We'll be working directly for IBM some of the time,&quot; Courtneyexplains, &quot;supporting their Office Vision projects, supporting softwareprojects they might have underway for the manufacturing arena.&quot; CTG doesn'tcount these projects in its systems integration revenues, even though theyinvolve considerable integration work.andM;While selling a part of itself to Big Blue, CTG has been busy makingacquisitions of its own.andP;  It bought SSS in 1988.andP;  In 1989, CTG picked up the16-member factory automation group of Radian Corp., based in Milwaukee, andadded its operations to SSS.andM;Until 1985, CTG did mostly contract programming.andP;  Then, worried bycompetition and enticed by what it regarded as golden opportunities in othersystems markets, it began acquiring companies.andP;  These companies includeDataware Inc., Buffalo, NY, (software conversion); Documentation ResourcesInc., Phoenix, AZ, (software documentation); Maxima Computer ManagementConsultants Ltd., Toronto, (project management); and TelecommunicationsManagement Corp., Needham, MA, (network systems integration).andM;Are any more acquisitions planned? You bet they are.andP;  Courtney says, &quot;We'llbe targeting more companies that could support systems integrationactivities, especially in the manufacturing arena.&quot; At the moment, CTG'ssystems integration is exclusively in manufacturing.andM;Ranking: CTG is the No.andP;  10 manufacturing integrator and the No.andP;  15 primecommercial integrator, according to G2.andM;KPMG Peat Marwick 's Information Technology Practice, the systems integrationarm of the venerable management consultant, has gone into the fix-itbusiness, establishing the Runaway Systems Management practice.andP;  Its charter:Clean up messes left by other systems integrators.andM;Repairing botched integration jobs is big business, according to JulesGhedina, partner in charge of Peat Marwick's Technology Resource Center.andP;  Atleast one-third of all systems integration projects now in existence fit inthe runaway category, as defined by Peat Marwick: that is, 2 to 5 times overbudget, 2 to 5 times behind schedule and missing their technical objectives.andM;&quot;We don't believe there is any major company that doesn't have a runawaysystems project,&quot; Ghedina says.andM;Peat Marwick often finds, as it did at a Midwest health-care provider, that arunlaway system has no rigorous work plans in place.andP;  &quot;Consequently, we'refaced with seatof-the-pants project management,&quot; says Ghedina.andP;  The firststep to regain control, he says, is for Peat Marwick to impose rigorousproject plans and practices on the entire team contributors, he says.andM;Another common problem is that the original systems integrator has ignoredthe people who are going to use the system.andP;  Peat Marwick's solution: Get theusers involved and write a project-management plan with clear goals and stickto it.andM;Reining in runaway systems is not necessarily a way to make friends, ofcourse.andP;  George Rittersbach, partner in charge in Atlanta, recalls a big EastCoast construction company where the client brought Peat Marwick in.andP;  Theoriginal integrator remained, but Peat Marwick provided oversight into allthe activities and redirected the project, Rittersbach explains.andP;  The resultwas a lot of bruised egos.andP;  Rittersbach adds, &quot;The only guy who likes you isthe president of the client company.&quot;andM;Peat Marwick's systems integration business hit $200 million in revenue forInformation Technology Practice last year in the United States, $450 millionworldwide.andP;  And business is on the upswing: revenues have registered a 22percent to 25 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past fiveyears.andM;The size of the systems integration staff is growing, too: up 20 percent inthe last year, to 2,000 consultants worldwide.andP;  That's about 40 percent ofPeat Marwick's total worldwide work force.andM;Simultaneously, the company is stepping up its integration partnering pace bysigning deals with companies like Apple Computer Inc. and Businessland Inc.andM;Peat Marwick plans to complete a yearlong reorganization and centralizationof its systems integration business by this July 1, the beginning of itsfiscal year.andP;  Stung by repeated losses in bids for commercial systemsintegration jobs, Peat Marwick began the reorganization late last year byconsolidating 20 practice centers into six regional offices.andP;  They are inAtlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York and Short Hills, NJ.andM;Information Technology Practice is comprised of three linked divisions:andM;Strategic Planning and Implementation, formed in 1986 with the acquisition ofstrategy-planning concern Nolan Norton andamp; Co., Lexington, MA.andM;Systems Management Consulting, which just established the EXIS (ExecutiveInformation) strategic alliance with Apple, under which Peat Marwick sets upexecutive information and decision-support systems using Macintosh and otherplatforms.andM;Peat Marwick Advanced Technology (PMAT), created last July and charged withrejuvenating old computer systems and doing hardware and software migrationsand conversions.andM;Ranking: Peat Marwick is the No.andP;  12 prime commercial integrator, accordingto G2.andM;One of McDonnell Douglas Corp. Systems Integration Corp.'s (SIC) most recentwins was a $27 million manufacturing integration project for Douglas Airport.andO;Everything from purchasing and assembly to management and engineering.andM;Was competing for the Douglas Aircraft contract a mere formality? Didn't SIChave it sewn up from the start? McDonnell Douglas says no.andP;  But it's a surebet that SIC's status as a subsidiary of its $14 billion parent didn't hurtits chances.andM;Surprisingly, SIC derives only 10 percent of its business from McDonnellDouglas; it generates almost all of the rest from external commercial systemsintegration projects.andM;&quot;We'd like to do a little more internally,&quot; concedes Ted Schroeder, vicepresident of marketing and planning, &quot;because that gives us a realcompetitive edge.andP;  We have in our backyard a large test bed [parent companyMcDonnell Douglas].&quot;andM;SIC, which evolved out of McDonnell Automation Center (McAuto), is the maincommercial and federal systems integration arm of aerospace giant McDonnellDouglas.andP;  SIC has annual revenues of around $300 million and employs morethan 2,000 people.andM;In July of last year, SIC honed its integration focus and targeted eightverticals: -  Manufacturing and engineering (its largest market);andM;Insurance;andM;Infrastructure (architecture and engineering construction at the state andlocal government level);andM;* Telecommunications;andM;* Professional services;andM;* Remote computing services (mostly outsourcing);andM;* Information systems engineering (CASE, software engineering, training andconsulting);andM;* Federal government (which contributes only 5 percent of SIC's overallrevenues).andM;The Douglas Aircraft contract is typical of SIC's integration projects.andP;  Thejob involves integrating a complete manufacturing center.andP;  SIC will provideapplications software by modifying its existing code to meet the needs of itsclient.andP;  &quot;In areas that we don't have the expertise or code, we willpartner,&quot; says Schroeder.andM;One of SIC's biggest partne*rs in the Douglas Aircraft project isHewlett-Packard Co., which supplies hardware and, often throughsubcontractors, applications software.andP;  Another majorsubcontractor-unannounced as yet-will be one of the Big Six accountingcompanies, which will handle much of the cost accounting and accountspayable/receivable applications.andM;But Schroeder is quick to point out that SIC always works with numerousvendors.andP;  For the Douglas project, that includes Data General Corp., DigitalEquipment Corp., IBM Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. &quot;Our strategy isheterogeneous computing,&quot; says Schroeder, &quot;and I think that's really key forour strategy as a systems integrator.&quot; Ranking: McDonnell Douglas SIC is theNo.andP;  2 database integrator, the No.andP;  4 telecommunications integrator, the No.andO;5 insurance integrator the No.andP;  6 manufacturing integrator and the No.andP;  7prime commercial integrator, according to G2.andM;Networking isn't the only logical base upon which to build a systemsintegration strategy.andP;  Just ask TRW Inc.'s Financial Systems group.andO;Financial Systems is pinning its star on image-processing  integration.andP;  Andit has sold some impressive customers on the imaging approach, includingAmerican Express, Bank of America, Citibank, J.C.andP;  Penny, Pacific Bell andthe U.S.andP;  Postal Service.andM;And TRW can claim to be one of the pioneers of image processing, withexperience dating back to 1974, the date that financial integrator TeknekronIndustries was founded.andP;  TRW bought Teknekron in 1986 and renamed it TRWFinancial Systems Inc. The 250-employee Financial Systems group is the maincommercial systems integration arm of TRW.andP;  Federal projects account for amere 10 percent of Financial Systems' business.)andM;TRW Financial Systems handles all aspects of imaging, including processing,storage, communications, output and reporting.andP;  It offers a line of imagingsystems for remittance processing, document processing, credit-card draftprocessing and check processing as turnkey products.andP;  And it also handlesnearly all details of integrationincluding operations consulting, functionalanalysis, operational improvement studies and product/market evaluation.andM;But TRW Financial Systems' biggest and best-known project-and the one whichbest illustrates the reasons for its systems integration success-is &quot;theworld's largest optical storage system,&quot; in the words of TRW FinancialSystems' vice president of Randamp;D, Vic Elischer.andP;  This system, called theEnhanced Country Club Billing System, was developed for American Express.andO;(See SYSTEMS INTEGRATION, May, Page 52.)andM;Thinking back, Elischer boasts: &quot;TRW Financial Systems designed all this.andP;  Wehad to invent 14 new things to make this work.andP;  [For example,] we designed acamera that would image [capture] documents at 28 images per second.andP;  Wedesigned a compressor board that would run at speeds of 28 images per second.andO;Compare this to a normal image system with a tabletop scanner that takes 30seconds to scan a single image and minutes to compress it.andP;  We perform thewhole process in milliseconds.&quot;andM;Simultaneously, TRW Financial Systems tries to avoid reinventing the wheel.andO;It buys hardware and software when appropriate, even for projects like theAmerican Express system.andP;  And it also partners freely with vendors such asATandamp;T, BancTec, Canon, Control Data Corp., Data General Corp., IBM Corp.,andO;Texas Instruments Inc. and Xerox Corp.andM;Note: TRW Financial Systems isn't the only part of TRW that does integration.andO;The largest of TRW's systems integration arms is the Systems IntegrationGroup (SIG).andP;  It is involved mostly in federal projects, although recently itis getting more and more commercial work.andP;  Commercial targets include thebanking, financing and telecommunications industries.andM;The Information Networks Division (IND) also focuses primarily on federalintegration.andP;  Its projects usually involve largecampus, transmission controlprotocol/ internet protocol  TCP/IP)-over-Ethernet configurations.andP;  Like SIG,IND is part of TRW's Space and Defense Sector.andM;Ranking: TRW is the No.andP;  1 image-processing integrator and the No.andP;  10 primecommercial integrator, according to G2.andM;Until early this year, Unisys Corp. offered systems integration servicesrevolving around its former Burroughs Inc. and Sperry Corp. product linesthrough its Complex Systems Organization (CSO).andP;  In January, Unisys tookanother step towards linking inextricably the two organizations' products andservices by replacing CSO with the streamlined Systems Management Group, orSMG.andM;SMG, like its Defense Systems Group and Government Systems Groupcounterparts, is charged with performing the entire spectrum of systemsintegration services based on Unisys' and other vendors' hardware andsoftware.andP;  Organizationally, SMG consists of three divisions: government SI,commercial SI and systems support (the professional services division thatserves both federal and commercial SI).andM;And Unisys predicts that the 1,500employee SMG will do $100 million inbusiness this year, with 90 percent of revenues coming from federal jobs and10 percent from commercial integration contracts.andP;  By 1994, however, thefederal/ commercial SMG split will approximate fifty-fifty, company officialsanticipate.andM;&quot;Unisys makes good stuff, and we have access to their technology and salespresence,&quot; boasts Bob Johnson, vice president and general manager of SMG'scommercial SI division.andM;But even more crucial to SMG's success than hardware and software isprofessional services-skills such as facilities management, front-endconsulting, and custom programming and analysis.andP;  For both the commercial andfederal SI divisions, professional services are provided almost exclusivelyby SMG's Systems Support Division (SSD).andM;&quot;We'll look at other vendors and integrators, but we feel we'd have a toughtime finding another company as qualified as SSD.andP;  They've got as good atrack record as any vendor in the industry,&quot; claims Johnson.andM;SMG's current strength is in selling to federal civilian and state and localgovernment agencies.andP;  It's attempting to leverage these skills to attack thefinance, banking, insurance, distribution, manufacturing and utilitiesvertical markets.andM;Simultaneously, SMG is working to build a reputation for itself in thenetworking/ communication, open-systems (a term that Unisys usesinterchangeably with Unix) and imaging-integration arenas.andM;Understandably so, SMG is drawing on several of these specialities infulfilling a $12.3 million contract that it won with Grumman Data Systems todesign a publicsafety information-management system for Suffolk County, NY.andO;Unisys is providing and integrating four A Series mainframes, 19 departmentalsystems running Unix, 799 Personal Workstation  2microcomputers and variouscommunications equipment.andM;Unisys will also be responsible for customizing and supporting versions ofits MAPPER fourth-generation language (4GL) and Standardized Tactical OnlinePublic Safety (STOPS) system.andM;Ranking: Unisys SMG is the No.andP;

 &quot;We're a consultant anddeveloper.andP;  We're trying to work with other intergrators to get them tofront-end their projects with Macintoshes,&quot; explains Jim O'Gara, director ofAIS.andM;AIS has won over some big-wigs with its approach.andP;  It has inked deals withArthur Andersen andamp; Co., Electronic Data Systems Corp., KPMG Peat Marwick andSHL Systemhouse Inc.. These companies are incorporating Macintoshes invarious types of decision-support/executive information system (DSS/ EIS)projects that they are designing and installing for their customers.andM;And AIS is working on expanding the Mac's integration potential in otherareas, including graphics, imaging/document management, multimedia andsales-automation applications.andP;  Besides providing its integrator partnerswith consulting services in these horizontal markets, AIS also does somenetwork design and rapid prototype work for selected clients.andM;O'Gara says that Apple also is starting to look at the outsourcing market asa potential revenue generator.andP;  It expects educational institutions to emergeas one of the most promising reservoirs of outsourcing clients in the comingyears.andM;All of the work handled by the 120-employee AIS is commercial.andP;  (Apple'sFederal Marketing Group handles government integration work.)andM;Much of Apple's current integration emphasis is the result of its campaign toinfiltrate the large business market.andP;  Steelcase and CSX Inc. are amongApple's most recent customers.andM;An alliance of four integration/ professional services companies, AvisInformation Systems, is a network-integration specialist.andP;  Founded b WarrenAvis of AVIS Rent-a-Car fame, the alliance is comprised of -  * ArcElectronic Associates Inc., both a data-communications integrator anddistributor (of products that include TI, satellite uplinks and microwavesystems);andM;* Avis Consulting, a network consulting and administration company;andM;* Avis Engineering Inc., a specialist in designing, building and supportingengineering cable plants;andM;Data Systems Network Corp., one of the largest U.S.andP;  network integrators.andM;Together, the four Avis Information companies provide commercial and federalcustomers with a complete range of networking integration services, rangingfrom design and product sales, to support and maintenance.andP;  (The commercialfederal split is 90:10.) Customers include The Boeing Co., Chrysler Corp.,andO;Honda, IBM Corp. Parke-Davis and Standard Federal.andP;  Above everything, AvisInformation touts its heterogeneous networking capabilities.andP;  &quot;We implementmultivendor solutions for our customers and combine personal computers (PCs),minicomputers and mainframes&quot; says Data Systems Network president MichaelGrieves.andM;When Businessland Inc. announced in March 1989 that it was set on becoming aplayer in the systems integration market through its Advanced Systemsdivision, few, if any, established integrators seemed to take notice.andP;  Butfollowing Businessland's much publicized win of an outsourcing contractinvolving an Eastman Kodak Co. data center, followed by an April announcementof its alliance with KPMG Peat Marwick to pursue large-scale systemsintegration contracts, people began to take Businessland's integrationintentions more seriously.andP;  (See SYSTEMS INTEGRATION, June, Page 15)andM;&quot;We needed to improve our percentage of value-added services, as well as do abetter job of monitoring and charging for them,&quot; says president and CEO DavidNorman.andP;  To achieve this, Businessland invested substantial sums of money toestablish Advanced Systems as a separate profit and loss center and to hire anew caliber of employee.andM;To keep up with the industry transition to clientserver computing,Businessland added Unix to its list of supported operating environments.andP;  (Atpress time, it was also expected to add IBM Corp.'s RS/6000 workstations toits hardware ranks.andP;  And it added A Computer Inc&quot;  s LocalTalk Ethernet, andfiber to its supported network configurations.andM;Even if Businessland's systems integration attempts are only moderatelysuccessful, it will still be one of the world's largest network integrators.andM;Start-up Evernet Systems Inc. is taking a unique approach to entering thesystems integration market.andP;  The company is acquiring small, regionalvalue-added resellers (VARS) that specialize in network integration and isrolling them into a single, national systems integration company.andM;Consequently, Evernet is focused exclusively on networkintegration-everything from personal computer (PC)-based local area networks(LANS) to enterprise-wide internetworking projects.andP;  Evernet's single productevaluation center tests all hardware and software products.andP;  So far,1-year-old Evernet has acquired about a half-dozen VARS.andP;  By the end of theyear, CEO Luther Nussbaum hopes to have 15 VARS.andM;An example of a typical Evernet integration project is the 1,200-node networkthat it installed for advertising agency Leo Burnett Co. The network consistsof 40 Novell Inc. 80386 file servers with mirrored internal 285M-byte diskdrives operating with SFT NetWare.andP;  The network topology is IBM Corp.'stoken-ring bridged internally at the server.andM;We want to &quot;combine the buying power and coverage of a national reseller witthe wide-area connectivity experience of integrators and the multivendor LANexpertise of local VARS,&quot; Nussbaum adds.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
