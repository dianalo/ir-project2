Especially forareas without natural gas supply, a comparison was made with an oil-and propane gas-fueled central heating system. Application of the heatpump system saves 21% respectively 16% primary energy annually. The heatpump contributed 78% to the heat demand with an average heat factor (C.O.P.)of 2.7. A description of the installation is given. The measured dataof the seasons 1981/1982 until and including 1986/1987 are presented.Investment costs and saving in costs are compared. 3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
