During Friday's session, Taiwan officials provided full detailsof the government's plan to cut its trade surplus to the U.S.delegation, headed by Deputy Assistant U.S. Trade RepresentativeMark Orr.   ``In many areas, the plan has made a positive contribution,''Orr said, ``but in other areas, the plan is not as ambitious as itcould be.''   Taiwan presented outlines of the four-year plan to Washington inMarch to try to avoid possible trade retaliation by the UnitedStates.   Under the plan, Taiwan is to liberalize its financial and trademarkets to reduce this island's trade imbalance by at least 10percent each year and gradually cut import tariffs until theyaverage 7 percent in 1992.   Last year, Taiwan registered a trade surplus of $10.4 billionwith the United States.   However, the U.S. delegation said the plan still allows Taiwanto maintain high tariffs on agricultural products. The UnitedStates also called for the lifting the ban on Taiwan's imports ofseveral agricultural products.   Taiwan's import tariffs for agricutural items currently average25.99 percent and will be lowered to 19.82 percent in 1992 underthe action plan.   Officials here argued that the government can only agree tosmaller tariff cuts in agricultural items to protect the interestsof local farmers.   Donald Bishop, spokesman for the American delegation, said theU.S. side recognized Taiwan's efforts in the direction ofliberalization, but ``Taiwan is still encouraged to do more.''   He said Taiwan was also urged to open more access to the UnitedStates to set up bank branches, insurance companies, and securityfirms here.   Last week, Taiwan was cited in a report by the Office of theU.S. Trade Representative as one of 34 countries which allegedlyimpose unfair barriers in trade with the Unied States.   The U.S. trade representative is expected to select nations byMay 30 for possible sanctions for unfair trade practices under the``Super 301'' provision of the U.S. Omnibus Trade Act. Many believeTaiwan, which ranked fourth among the 34 countries may be placed onthe priority list.   The United States accuses Taiwan of maintaining barriers throughimport licensing, limits on access to the insurance market,agricultural export susidies, ineffective intellectual-propertyprotection and monopoly practices.</TEXT></DOC>
