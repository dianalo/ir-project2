AKRE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Workers finished scrubbing the laststretches of Prince William Sound shoreline that Exxon plans toclean this year as Valdez prepares for a raucous weekend to mark thesummer cleanup's end.   The party comes even though the cleanup from the nation's worstoil spill remains uncompleted.   Major tasks for today and Friday included treating the shorelinewith fertilizer to stimulate microorganisms into attacking the oil,Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker said Wednesday.   At the height of the cleanup, Exxon had about 12,000 peopleworking on the effort, with about a quarter on the sullied shores.Exxon has been scaling back for two weeks with the goal of endingthe cleanup Friday.   Friday also marks the 25-week anniversary of the wreck of theExxon Valdez, which dumped nearly 11 million gallons of Alaskancrude when it struck a reef south of Valdez.   The final 700 shoreline workers will be returned to Valdezthrough Saturday, Tucker said. They will be joined by about 400sailors and Marines who will arrive next weekend for three days ofleave in the busy oil port. An estimated 100 reporters andphotographers also have arrived.   The expected deluge of tired workers and servicemen, combinedwith plans for a huge party Sunday sponsored by Exxon's two majorcleanup contractors, has city officials worried.   ``Our little police department will have its hands full,'' saidGary Hennigh, acting city manager. ``We hear about the 20 to 25 kegsthat have been ordered and that it's just going to be a grand oldtime.   ``That many people, with that much free beer after being out inthe boondocks for a few months could be pretty wild and wooly.''   Police Chief Bert Cottle said he is concerned his 14-officerstaff may be overwhelmed.   ``They're talking anywhere from 500 to 1,000 people at thatparty,'' Cottle said. ``This might be the biggest weekend we everhad.''   Hennigh fears the prospect of hundreds of men descending onValdez with fat cleanup paychecks could have another side effect.   ``I suppose if there are any entrepreneurial, unemployed hookersup in Anchorage and they knew that there was going to be such amassive onslaught of men with money in their pockets, they mightshow up in Valdez,'' he said.   The streets of Valdez were relatively quiet Wednesday asresidents enjoyed the first sunshine in several days. Clouds aslarge as the mountains that tower over Prince William Sound hoverednear town, however, warning of the end of summer.   Exxon decided to end the cleanup in mid-September because of theprospect of increasingly severe weather. State officials havecriticized the pullout, arguing that the weather may allow effortsto continue into November.   Gov. Steve Cowper on Friday will announce what the state will dothis winter to monitor spill-affected areas and to protect resourcesthreatened with further damage, said Steve Provant of the stateDepartment of Environmental Conservation.   Provant said the state does not plan to take over the cleanup ona large scale during the winter, Provant said. ``We don't have theresources to do it,'' he said.   Exxon says it has done all it can to clean up more than 1,000miles of shoreline, but state authorities say much of the job isunfinished.   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reillysaid Sunday that the federal government will have the final say onthe adequacy of the cleanup next spring, when a new survey will bemade.   Reilly defended Exxon's withdrawal of workers this week, saying,``My sense is that the weather is such there that it would be veryrisky to leave a lot of those folks in that exposed position.''</TEXT></DOC>
