A new nomination may come before week's end, said the official,who refused to be identified other than as a senior administrationofficial. ``Obviously we're interested in moving rapidly.''   Possible choices include Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, and formerRep. Jack Edwards, R-Ala., as well as onetime defense secretariesDonald Rumsfeld and James Schlesinger, said sources who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, saidhe was not in line to be defense secretary, but that did not dampenspeculation that he was being considered.   Some members of Congress have suggested a job swap betweenScowcroft and Tower, since the national security adviser's job doesnot require confirmation.   Two hours before the Senate rejected Tower, 53-47, Bush leftWashington for a speech-making visit in New York. Before hisdeparture, Bush spoke briefly with Scowcroft about a replacement forTower, said the senior administration official.   The official said a long list of candidates had been compiled.``There's been a list for a long time,'' the official said, notingthat names had been compiled before Tower was finally selected lastDecember. ``We're not starting from scratch.''   Other names being mentioned were Sen. John Warner, R-Va., aformer Navy secretary; former Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis;Frank Borman, onetime astronaut turned business executive; andZbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser under PresidentCarter and a supporter of Bush in the presidential campaign.   In a written statement, Bush said Tower had devoted his life topublic service. ``Instead of the recompense of a grateful nation,John Tower's lot in the past weeks has been a cruel ordeal.''   ``For this I am truly sorry for both him and his family,'' Bushsaid.   Bush also called Tower and said, ``I am with you. I'm sorry aboutthe outcome. You've done a great job. We care about you and thefamily.'' His comments were relayed by White House press secretaryMarlin Fitzwater.   While saying he disagreed with the Senate vote, Bush made clearhe wants to move on from the divisive debate over Tower. ``We owe itto the American people to come together and move forward,'' Bushsaid.   Bush was called by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., who led the fight against Tower.They expressed interest in working with Bush in a cooperative andconstructive fashion, Fitzwater said.   Bush said he appreciated the call and the spirit in which it wasmade, the press secretary said.   Washington buzzed with the names of possible successors.   ``It must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff andthe national security adviser and any number of congressmen andsenators and any number of other outside experts have candidates onthe tip of their tongue,'' said Fitzwater.   ``And they are more than willing and ready to provide those namesand to begin consideration of them when the time comes,'' he added.   Fitzwater said there was no timetable for picking a new Pentagonchief but said Bush would act ``very rapidly.''   After a bitter debate, the Senate rejected Tower's nomination ina late-afternoon vote. Tower had been dogged by allegations ofexcessive drinking, womanizing and conflict of interest with defensecontractors.   Cohen, a senior member of the Armed Services Committee and thevice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, helped lead theSenate fight for Tower's nomination. His nomination would not costRepublican strength in the Senate since Maine has a Republicangovernor, John McKernan, who would make sure the seat remains in GOPhands.   On the other hand, the selection of Warner would cost the GOP inthe Senate since Virginia's Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles wouldsurely fill the vacancy with a member of his own party.   Edwards was the senior Republican on the House Appropriationsdefense subcommittee for many years and was highly regarded for hisknowledge of the defense budget and defense issues. He most recentlywas co-chairman of a presidential commission which recommendedclosing obsolete military bases.   Throughout the long fight over Tower's nomination, White Houseofficials were under orders from Bush not to talk about othercandidates. However, that prohibition dissolved Thursday when itbecame certain that Tower's nomination was doomed.   Putting the best face on the episode, Fitzwater said, ``We foughta long fight, hard and well. Out of this struggle has come a goodunity with the Republican Party. We brought the administration teamtogether and we feel that it's been a tempering affair that shouldserve us well as we move forward.''   White House officials _ Scowcroft among them _ have complainedthat the holdup on Tower's nomination has slowed the administrationdown on matters of national security.   The Pentagon has missed congressional deadlines for three reportson important military issues and does not have a secretaryrepresenting it during a special 90-day strategic military policyreview ordered by Bush.   On a broader scale, the Tower battle dominated the White Houseagenda, at times overshadowing other issues Bush wanted to highlight.   Defense officials worry privately that even under the best ofcircumstances, it will be weeks more before a new candidate can bepicked, undergo a background check and win confirmation.</TEXT></DOC>
