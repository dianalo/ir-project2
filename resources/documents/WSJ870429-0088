Ernest BeazleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> X BSEARNINGS (ERN)MINING, METALS (NON-PRECIOUS) (MIN) </IN><TEXT>   USX Corp., hurt by the aftershocks of a six-month steelworkers strike, posted a first-quarter loss of $97 million, while Bethlehem Steel Corp. reported a quarterly profit for only the second time since 1985.    Despite its loss, which narrowed sharply from the year-earlier $249 million deficit, USX appeared to be en route to recovery from the United Steelworkers walkout that ended Feb. 1. The strike, the longest in the steel industry's history, closed USX mills in eight states.    Saying &quot;the worst is now behind us,&quot; David M. Roderick, chairman of the giant steel and energy concern, predicted that USX would regain profitability &quot;both on an operating and net income basis&quot; during the current quarter. Mr. Roderick added that he expects USX &quot;to post a profit in each of the remaining quarters and to be profitable for the year.&quot;    Separately, Bethlehem, the nation's No. 3 steelmaker, eked out earnings of $25.6 million, or 38 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $91.8 million. The earnings represented only the fourth profitable quarter for Bethlehem in the past 21 periods.    Bethlehem's improved performance mainly reflected a $32.5 million investment tax credit refund. Though the credit was repealed under last year's new tax law, special provisions -- pushed through by senators and representatives from steel states -- provide steelmakers with a refund of 50% of their unused credits. Bethlehem plans to record an added $97.5 million in credits this year.    Nonetheless, Bethlehem's results also pointed up the lingering benefits of the strike at Pittsburgh-based USX, the nation's largest steelmaker. Though USX mills have restarted, their long shutdown has sparked short-term steel shortages, enabling competitors to push through higher prices. Moreover, USX won't reach normal production levels until midsummer at the earliest. USX accounts for nearly a fifth of domestic steel shipments.    Citing higher prices, Walter F. Williams, Bethlehem chairman, told shareholders yesterday that he expects Bethlehem to stay in the black through next quarter. He singled out the Bethlehem, Pa.-based company's rising order backlog and predicted higher average steel prices through the second quarter.    Sales at USX, reflecting the steel strike, fell 40% to $2.79 billion from $4.65 billion year earlier.    The USX results generally matched or slightly exceeded Wall Street expectations. &quot;The biggest surprise here is Roderick's prediction of a profitable second quarter,&quot; said Michelle Galanter Applebaum, a steel analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. She linked the expected improvement to higher steel prices and the closing of two unprofitable mills earlier this year.    Nonetheless, the strike, coupled with the cost of restarting facilities, offset better results from the company's oil and gas operations, which account for 60% of sales. USX's steel unit posted an operating loss of $192 million, compared with a $24 million loss a year earlier. Sales tumbled to $190 million from $1.4 billion.    USX's Mr. Roderick said the steel unit expects to be profitable the rest of the year.    Steel shipments, reflecting minor production in February and March, plunged to 496,000 tons from 3,037,000 tons a year earlier. Raw-steel production fell to 854,000 tons from 4,562,000 tons as the company's mills operated at just 18.1% of capacity, down from 70.6% a year earlier.    USX's energy operations, buoyed by a $27 million write-up in the value of oil inventories, rebounded to post an operating profit of $121 million, compared with an operating loss of $127 million a year earlier. The year-before results included a $351 million write-down of oil inventories.    Bethlehem posted an operating profit of $20.2 million in the latest quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $62.2 million. The company's basic steelmaking operations posted operating earnings of $49.2 million, compared with a $36.4 million loss.    Sales fell slightly to $1.13 billion from $1.17 billion. Steel shipments rose to 2,339,000 tons from 2,231,000 tons as the company's mills operated at 71% of capacity, compared with 66% a year earlier.    Bethlehem's Mr. Williams said the steelmaker will push for an extension of the Reagan administration's import quotas on steel beyond their scheduled expiration in 1989. Speaking at the annual meeting, he also renewed his call for government assistance to help the industry cut excess production capacity, mainly by lowering high exit costs, such as pension obligations to workers.    The Bethlehem executive, named to the top post last spring, said the steelmaker will continue to examine a bankruptcy-law filing as one option in restructuring, particularly in light of such moves by LTV Corp. and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. However, he again noted that Bethlehem hasn't any near-term plans to do so.    Earlier this month, LTV, Inland Steel Industries Inc., Armco Inc. and Weirton Steel Corp. all reported first-quarter profits. </TEXT></DOC>
