Economists, who have been revising first-quarter forecastsright and left as March data materializes, say consumerprices should be tamer, industrial production and capacityutilization should hold firm, housing starts should slip backto normally depressed levels, and the February trade deficitshould improve substantially. Most of the week's data are dueout tomorrow and much of the month-to-month changes arepegged to anomalies of weather.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're one of the largest industrialized countries, yet alittle warm weather here or there seems to affect us as muchas a small agricultural economy,&quot; said Samuel D. Kahan,economist at Fuji Securities Inc., Chicago. It all adds up tosome unforeseen strength in first-quarter numbers, he said.&quot;But is it real?&quot;   In recent weeks, several economists have raised theirfirst-quarter forecasts, citing weather and other specialfactors. &quot;The first quarter turned out to be stronger than wethought,&quot; said David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, Lexington, Mass. He now estimates real grossnational product grew at about a 2% rate in the firstquarter. DRI &quot;borrowed&quot; most of the higher growth estimatefrom the second quarter. &quot;We now think the two quarters willbe more or less the same size, rather than a weak firstquarter and a strong second quarter,&quot; he said.   Extremely cold weather in December sent fuel and foodcosts soaring in a wave that hasn't yet fully retraceditself. And, January's unusually mild weather boostedemployment, throwing many jobs and output forecasts out ofwhack.   March consumer prices are expected to rise only a modest0.2% or so, though some economists say the number mayactually slide into the negative. Friday'sbetter-than-expected report on March producer prices showedthe first drop in wholesale prices in seven months. Much ofthe improvement in both indexes is believed to be a reboundfrom sharply higher fuel and food costs because of frigidweather early in the year.   The March consumer price index is also expected to benefitfrom a fallback in clothing prices. In February, the CPI rose0.5%, partly because of a 3.3% jump in apparel costs. Thelatest reading is also expected to benefit from lowergasoline prices that weren't fully passed through in theFebruary index.   A drop in oil imports -- another weather-related factor --is expected to help the February trade imbalance. The deficitis believed to have narrowed to about $8 billion fromJanuary's $9.3 billion, according to a survey by MMSInternational Inc., a unit of McGraw-Hill, New York.   March housing starts, on the other hand, are expected tofall back to an annual rate of about 1.4 million units aftera step-up in building to take advantage of the earlier mildweather.   Industrial production is expected to expand a bit, despitelingering declines in manufacturing employment, said MorganStanley Co. economist Stephen S. Roach. Much of the firmnessstems from a weather-related rebound in utility production,Mr. Roach said in his weekly commentary. He expects a 0.3%increase in output, a bit stronger than the consensus view,which calls for a 0.1% upgrade. Output rose 0.6% in February.   Benchmark revisions in March industrial production and itsoffshoot capacity utilization reset the base year to 1987from 1977 and adjust the industry mix to reflect the morerecent data. Not surprisingly, the biggest change in thebusiness mix came in the computer sector, according to arecent article in the latest Federal Reserve Bulletin. Itsaid the revised annual growth rate of business equipment was&quot;quite a bit stronger&quot; than previously shown because ofsharply faster growth of office and computing machines. Thechanges bring the Fed's data closer in line with the CommerceDepartment's revised reading on computer growth.   ---                  Closely Watched Reports                                                                                                              Statistics Released in the Week Ended April 6                                                                                                                                                       CHANGE                                                (from prior                                     TOTAL       period)                                                                                                          Money supply    M1 -- Week ended    April 2 (in billions)           $808.3      +$3.4                                                                                                           M2 -- Week ended    April 2 (in billions)         $3,269.0      -$4.0                                                                                                           M3 -- Week ended    April 2 (in billions)         $4,062.3      -$7.1                                                                                                          March (in billions)             $148.55      -0.6%                                                                                                          New jobless claims   Week ended March 31             338,000      -1.2%                                                                                                          Business inventories   February (in billions)          $794.60      -0.4%                                                                                                          Producer price index   March                            117.0%      -0.2%                                                                                                                   Statistics to Be Released This Week                                                                                                          Consumer price index (Tues.)
