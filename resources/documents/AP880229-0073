(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Super Tuesday was hailed today as ``themain event'' of the primary season as centrist Democrats who hadhoped to give the presidential campaign a Southern flavor opened atwo-day meeting.   ``Democrats can't win the White House without winning theSouth,'' former Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia told the DemocraticLeadership Council.   Robb is the outgoing chairman of the council and a prime moverin getting Southern states to hold nearly all their primaries andcaucuses on March 8, now dubbed Super Tuesday. He said the 20states that will vote that day represent ``the first broad-basedtest of the primary season _ the first opportunity for thecandidates to address a truly national audience.''   He said that ``as the sun rises on Super Tuesday, fewer than 10percent of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention willhave been selected. By sunset, as a result of voting that begins onthe shores of the Atlantic Ocean and ends thousands of miles awayin the Pacific Ocean, over 40 percent of the delegates to Atlanta(site of the convention) will have been chosen.''   Robb also noted that the Super Tuesday states represent 207electoral votes, 76 percent of the total needed to be electedpresident.   ``So to a large extent,'' he said, ``the general electionchances of the Democratic Party rest with these 20 states. Thepreliminaries are over and Super Tuesday is indisputably the mainevent of the primary season.''   In at least one sense, however, Super Tuesday is not turning outas some of its creators had hoped. Three of the leading Democraticcontenders were pursuing agendas far from that advocated by theDemocratic eadership Council.   The candidate with the largest base in the South is JesseJackson, who has referred scornfully to the DLC as the ``DemocraticLeisure Class.''   Another leading contender is Gov. Michael Dukakis ofMassachusetts, whose Northeast base is exactly the wrong place mostDLC members think the party ought to look for its next nominee.   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri was a founder of the DLC, buthas become a leading 1988 contender by advocating the kind of tradesanctions sought by organized labor and anathema to the DLC.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, the southerner in the race,but never a particular favorite of the DLC, is pursuing a SuperTuesday strategy, taking stands to the right of his rivals.   The Democrats DLC members most wanted to see in the presidentialrace were Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and former Gov. Charles Robb ofVirginia. Robb is ending a term as DLC chairman and will bereplaced by Nunn.   The DLC was established in the wake of the 1984 election inwhich Democratic presidential candidate Walter F. Mondale carriedonly one state. That landslide defeat was the party's fourth lossin the last five presidential elections.   The problem, decided many Democratic officials from the Southand West, was the disproportionate weight wielded in the party bylabor, minority groups and Eastern liberals. It was time to givethe South a stronger voice in choosing the next nominee and time todiminish the importance of Iowa and New Hampshire.   Thus was born Super Tuesday, which amounts to a Southernregional primary. Twenty states will hold primaries or caucuses onMarch 8, a majority of them south of the Mason-Dixon Line.   A discussion of ``The Super Tuesday Challenge'' was on theagenda for the DLC's two-day meeting at Colonial Williamsburg.   Other topics included ``Democratic Capitalism: New Strategiesfor Growth With Equity,'' and ``Citizenship and National Service.''   But the most watched event of the meeting will be a debateMonday night between five of the party's six presidentialcandidates.   Participating in the forum at the College of William and Maryare Gephardt, Jackson, Gore, Dukakis and former Sen. Gary Hart ofColorado.   Not joining was Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, who is passing upSuper Tuesday.   The most recent Democratic debate on Saturday in Atlanta was acontentious confrontation with Dukakis, Gephardt and Gore attackingeach other.   Displaying his most aggressive style of the campaign, Dukakisfocused on Gephardt's vote in favor of President Reagan's 1981 taxcut and said Gore ``has never run a government.''   Gephardt retorted that Dukakis had ``raised taxes about 10times'' in Massachusetts, while Gore said the governor would need``on the job training in foreign policy.''</TEXT></DOC>
