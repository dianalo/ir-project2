Cheney toured the U.S. Army's infantry training site in thecentral West German town of Butzbach, at the start of a three-dayvisit to West Germany.   ``I look at the developments in the East with, I think, a kindof hope and optimism that we may in fact be at the beginning of anew era, if you will, in international relations,'' Cheney said.   ``But I think it's far too soon for us to declare that the ColdWar has ended or that peace is at hand,'' he said.   The Soviets' strategic nuclear capability is ``more robusttoday'' than when Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in March 1985,Cheney said. He said he has to deal with the ``reality of militarypower.''   ``That reality today is that the Soviet Union is still the onlynation in the world that has the power to destroy the UnitedStates,'' he said.   Cheney arrived by helicopter at a huge, open range covered withdust and tread marks.   There he received a briefing on the defensive strategy of aplatoon of four Bradley fighting vehicles, tank-like weaponscapable of firing missiles and outfitted with a 20mm gun.   The Bradley had been plagued by criticism that it was unable tooperate in water as designed. However, Army officials say thoseproblems have been fixed.   Cheney received a briefing from 2nd Lt. Curt Carney, 24, ofBoise, Idaho, of the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Armored Division.   Carney described his platoon's strategy and explained how heworks with Army heavy equipment operators who dig huge holes with aramp-like exit that let the Bradley hide most of its bulkunderground.   At one point, Cheney climbed onto the Bradley to shake handswith the young crew members.   Standing before the combat-ready crew, Cheney praised U.S.military personnel as being ``some of the most talented anddedicated men and women we've ever had in uniform.''   ``We welcome the effort of Mr. Gorbachev to seek to reform theSoviet Union. Hopefully, he will be successful,'' Cheney said.``Hopefully, that success will result in a Soviet Union that isless hostile, less threatening to the West than has been true forthe last 40 years.''   He said there were signs of reductions in Soviet conventionalnaval forces, but said he would speculate that ``the new unitscoming in will be more capable than the old ones going out, whichis, after all, the way we operate as well.''   ``We're pleased with the announcement by the Soviets of anintention to reduce conventional armaments unilaterally in theEast,'' he noted.   Cheney was asked about disclosures from U.S. intelligencesources that the Soviets were deploying two new kinds of advancednuclear-tipped missiles around Moscow as part of a vastly upgradeddefense of the capital.   Cheney said he was not aware of any specific developments, butsaid such a system was already in place and is allowed under termsof the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.   Cheney also responded to a Soviet offer to curtail foreignbases, saying the United States also was ``looking at basestructure, especially in a time of tight budgets.'' He noted thatU.S. military operations at Torrejon in Spain were based phasedout, at the request of the Spanish government.</TEXT></DOC>
