<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-0693 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method for polarizing a fast beam of particles by collisional pumping,comprising the steps of: generating a beam of unpolarized ions; and generatingan electron-spin-polarized medium of atoms positioned as a target forthe beam. The target medium being sufficiently thick to allow the beamto interact with the medium to produce collisional pumping by repeatedcharge-changing collisions of the initially unpolarized ions of the beamwith the electron-spin-polarized atoms of the target to produce a successionof electron-capture and electron-loss collisions to pump both the electron-spinand nuclear-spin polarization of the beam up to substantially the electron-spinpolarization of the target.</TEXT></DOC>
