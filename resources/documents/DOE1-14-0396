<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-14-0396 </DOCNO><TEXT>Independent precise measurements of lattice period by the Bond techniqueand of density by hydrostatic weighing make it possible to estimate thestructural type and concentration of dominating point self-defects, deviationfrom stoichiometry and limits of homogeneity with errors varying from5x10/sup 17/ to 3x10/sup 18/ cm/sup -1/ for A/sup 3/B/sup 5/ compounds.Fundamental errors of measuring the deviations from stoichiometry dueto inaccurate information about X-ray radiation wavelengths and Avogadronumber are not of principle. The main contribution to the absolute errorof determining the deviation from stoichiometry is made by an error ofestimating the atomic mass of crystal-forming elements.</TEXT></DOC>
