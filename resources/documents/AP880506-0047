Skyscraper fires are physically exhausting to put out, withfirefighters huffing up stairs with 50 pounds of equipment and airtanks on their backs. Reserves are called up often for relief andto replenish air supplies.   ``It's a very hazardous, punishing type of fire,'' said RogerLanaham of the U.S. Fire Administration in the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency. ``You have to have shock troops. It's like atough football game. You have to keep bringing in fresh blood.''   People trapped above the fire must be evacuated, sometimes byhelicopter but preferably down stairwells. And precautions must betaken to keep those on the street from being showered withheat-shattered glass.   Aerial ladders and cranes reach no higher than 10 floors, sofirefighters work the fire from the inside, setting up a stagingarea on a floor below the fire. They bring hoses, equipment, firstaid and compressed air. Oxygen is never carried because it canignite.   ``It's a manual operation that takes more personnel than anyother fire. It's also an inside fire. They can't put the fire outfrom the outside. That's what makes it so dangerous,'' said JosephRedden, spokesman for the National Fire Protection Association inQuincy, Mass., a former Newark, N.J. fire chief.   High-rise fires create a chimney effect, sucking heat and smokeup stairwells and elevator shafts to the top of the building.Firefighters open bulkheads or smash holes in the roof to preventexplosive buildups.   In the 1980 MGM Grand Hotel fire in Las Vegas, Nev., 74 of the87 deaths came from smoke inhalation, according to fire officials.Most victims were found trapped on the top seven floors of the26-story building.   Another fire that prompted improved designs and sprinklersystems was a 1986 blaze that killed 97 people, including 84 on afirst floor casino, at the DuPont Plaza Hotel in San Juan, PuertoRico. Three hotel workers pleaded guilty to setting the fire.   ``In a fire, smoke is usually a killer, not the flames,'' saidJohn Mulligan, spokesman for the New York City Fire Department. ``Ahigh-rise fire is going to be hot and smoky and among the mostdifficult firefighting conditions.''   New York has 1,200 high-rises or buildings that are more than 75feet tall. The city averages one fire per day in a high-rise,although most are in lower floors and are easily contained,Mulligan said.   Firefighters say real life bears little resemblance to theHollywood hokum of the movie ``The Towering Inferno,'' in whichmost of the stars scrambled to the roof to await rescue.   ``You never want to get above the fire,'' Redden said. ``That'sthe worst place you can be.''</TEXT></DOC>
