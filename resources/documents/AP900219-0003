It is the region's shattered economythat is forcing many to leave.   ``Most people very strongly want to stay here. I can't explainit. It's hard to make the people of south Norway understand, muchless foreigners,'' said Vigor Rossvaer, a University of Tromsoeresearcher.   For unemployed fisherman Vidar Esbensen, the answer is simple:``This is home.''   The Norwegian arctic is vast, sparsely populated and beautiful,with snow-capped mountains sloping down into the fjords and thenorthern lights staging nightly shows. But gorgeous scenery doesn'tpay the mortgage.   Unemployment, alcoholism and the death rate have long beenhigher than the Norwegian average. Then in January, codfish quotaswere slashed to protect declining Barents Sea stocks, putting achokehold on the region's main income.   ``You can't live on the quota, and you don't quite die from iteither,'' said Esbensen, 35, who was thrown out of work when thecod quota was cut from 350,000 to 130,000 tons.   Earlier this month the government offered a 500 million kroner($77 million) bail-out package, mainly interest relief on stateloans, to tide fishermen over while long-term solutions are sought.   Disappointed fishermen called the package ``a Band-Aid on abullet wound,'' and threatened strikes.   In the northernmost province of Finnmark, unemployment is 7.7percent compared to 3.9 percent in Oslo, Norway's capital. Thecounty population has been falling for 40 years, and dropped by 6.8percent in the past decade to 75,000.   A survey of those who left indicated that 51.6 percent soughtbetter jobs or schools, while 22.7 percent said they were drivenoff by bad weather and the depressing 24-hour winter nights.   Rossvaer said the north is a victim of ecology, economy and evenworld politics. International pressure forced an end to whalehunting, an important industry.   Improving relations with the Soviet Union is both menacing andencouraging, especially in Finnmark, which curls eastward, as if ona mapmaker's whim, over northern Sweden and Finland to butt againstthe Soviet Union along a 122-mile border.   Some residents fear a scaling back of the permanent militarypresence and periodic NATO maneuvers, which brought airports, busservices, roads and employment to the north. On the other hand, anopen Soviet border could mean income from trade and tourism.   Business analyst Sven Oppegaard predicts a reconstruction of theregion's economic and social base. Scattered hamlets, whereresidents catch and process their own fish, will give way tolarger, more efficient centers, he says.   Some fishing stations already are abandoned.   ``We can't have a tiny village with a church, school and fishfactory on every little point of land,'' said Oppegaard, of theNorwegian Confederation of Business and Industry.   The military disagrees. Residents in villages dotting the long,jagged coast report on Soviet naval activity, said GunnarAngeltveit of the Defense Ministry.   Modern pressures are building up in this once-isolated,tightly-knit coastal society, which may account for the 73 percentincrease in suicides from 1975 to 1985 and rising alcohol abuse,said Rossvaer.   ``There is a conflict of two cultures. One is modern Norway,with its attractions, and the other is the traditional coastalculture,'' he said.   Northerners are friendly, open, imaginative, and sometimeswishful. Most villages, even those seldom visited, have a localpolar museum, adorned with relics of seal and whale hunts.   Locals scratching for opportunities see tourism as a way to helppreserve fading ways of life: whale hunting with cameras, reindeerrides and dogsled treks. One suggested selling tourists necktiesmade from salmon skins.   ``We will do whatever we can to hang on,'' said Esbensen. ``It'shard in the Barents, especially in storms, but there is a freedomout there. I've tried working on land. I couldn't take it.''   Not everyone can stick it out. Two years after itsfish-processing plant closed, the village of Bugoeynes won nationalattention with an advertisement seeking a new home in the south _anywhere with jobs and room for all 300 villagers.   ``We don't really want to leave. This is a cry for help,'' onevillager admitted.   ``They're a symbol of a people trying to keep their societyintact, even if it means moving south together,'' said Rossvaer.</TEXT></DOC>
