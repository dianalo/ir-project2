<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-75-0063 </DOCNO><TEXT>Current design approaches for gas cleaning consist of the serial applicationof a number of gas-cleaning processes, each of which is designed to removeone or more contaminant species. Such as aerosols (both particles andliquid droplets), sulfur compounds, inorganic compounds, alkali and heavymetals, and organic chemicals. In order to reduce the capital investmentrequired for gas-cleaning the approaches and processes available to removecontaminants from the process gas were reviewed and examined for opportunitiesto achieve simplification or elimination of units through additionalresearch and development. The process components reviewed in this paperwere 1) quenching, cooling and heat recovery; 2) removal of particles,aerosols, and inorganic compounds; 3) acid-gas removal and sulfur recovery.9 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
