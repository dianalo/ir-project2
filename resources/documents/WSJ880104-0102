The rate cuts, which were expected, reflect reduced connection charges to long-distance companies. An earlier FCC order required local phone companies to reduce those charges. Since ATandamp;T was broken up in January of 1984, long distance prices have dropped about 36%. But local rates generally have risen, and the increases have been quite sharp in some areas.    The latest FCC order will likely lead to price reductions by ATandamp;T's competitors, which try to match its price breaks.    ATandamp;T's overall rate cut is only slightly lower than the $800 million cut it proposed in November, when it began pressuring the FCC to force the local companies to lower their connection charges. But the final rates cut prices even more for businesses than originally proposed and less for residential customers.    While the overall rate cut of 3.5% is close to ATandamp;T's original proposal of 3.6%, services used heavily by businesses will be cut more than originally proposed. Daytime rates will fall 6.4%, instead of the initially proposed 6.3%, while evening rates will fall 1.9% instead of the earlier proposed 2.2%. Night rates will fall 0.6% instead of the originally proposed 0.8%. Residential customers tend to make most of their calls at night and during the evening.    Businesses also will see overall rates for 800 service fall 3.6%, ATandamp;T said, a bigger cut than the originally proposed 2.9%. WATS prices will fall an average of 5.2%, instead of the initially proposed 4.4%, ATandamp;T said. Rates for ATandamp;T's Software Defined Network service, used exclusively by businesses, will fall overall by 6.3%, instead of the earlier proposed 5.4%, ATandamp;T said. But rates for ATandamp;T's Megacom 800 service will fall only 5.9%, instead of the initially proposed 6.3%, ATandamp;T said.    The ATandamp;T rate cuts should intensify the competition for business customers between ATandamp;T and its principal national rivals, MCI Communications Corp., Washington, and US Sprint Communications Co., a long distance joint venture between GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn., and United Telecommunications Inc. of Kansas City, Mo. A year and a half ago, US Sprint and MCI began focusing on business customers, upgrading the technology in their phone networks and devising new services and pricing plans designed to woo business customers of ATandamp;T that make huge numbers of phone calls. US Sprint and MCI usually follow ATandamp;T's pricing actions.    US Sprint wouldn't say last week whether it would lower its rates to maintain an overall discount to ATandamp;T. &quot;US Sprint will file appropriate action with the FCC in the very near future after thoroughly reviewing&quot; the ATandamp;T price cuts, the company said in a prepared statement.    MCI said it probably will reduce its rates to stay competitive with ATandamp;T, but the company hasn't determined yet whether it will lower prices to businesses more than to residential customers. Overall, an MCI spokesman said, the company was pleased with the FCC action because MCI's costs to connect to the local phone companies will be lower. MCI executives have said in the past that the local companies, particularly the Bells, should lower their connection charges because, in some cases, they are earning more money than that allowed by regulators. </TEXT></DOC>
