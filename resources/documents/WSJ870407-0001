BulkeleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   Seven years ago, 30-year-old W.E. &quot;Pete&quot; Petersen was stocking shelves part time in an Orem, Utah, grocery store, while his custom drapery business faltered.    Today, the drapery business is gone. But Mr. Petersen is earning a six-figure income and beating back eager investment bankers as the executive vice president of one of the fastest growing and least likely success stories in the computer software industry.    Mr. Petersen, now a cherubic, 37-year-old, is the businessman at the helm of closely held WordPerfect Corp. The Orem-based company is now the leading maker of word-processing software. It had $52.2 million in sales last year, more than double 1985's mark, and it is now the fifth-biggest independent personal computer software company, according to the latest ranking by SoftLetter, a Cambridge, Mass., trade newsletter.    At a time when market analysts describe the software industry as an oligopoly dominated by three big companies, a second tier of companies is carving out substantial -- and profitable -- niches. Sales for Autodesk Inc., a Sausalito, Calif., maker of computerized design software, grew 84% to $52.4 million last year. Borland International Inc., Scotts Valley, Calif., nearly tripled its sales in the 12 months through Dec. 31. to an estimated $30 million on the strength of its low-priced language and utility programs.    These companies still are dwarfed in size by the Big Three: Lotus Development Corp., Cambridge, Mass.; Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., and Ashton-Tate, Torrance, Calif., each of which had sales in the last 12 months exceeding $200 million. But the upstart success of little guys like Borland and Autodesk demonstrates that the right products and strategy at the right time still count in the lively software market.    WordPerfect's success in particular flies in the face of convention. While 15 of the 16 largest software companies are on the East or West Coasts, WordPerfect is in Utah. When most software companies complain about the cost of answering questions from users, WordPerfect provides a toll-free line for its customers' calls. Though the stock market is receptive to them and eager underwriters plead, the company's founders refuse to go public.    And while the three biggest software companies sell word-processor programs, WordPerfect has outsold them all, with a grip on an estimated 30% of the International Business Machines Corp.-compatible word-processing market.    Of course, there isn't any guarantee the company will keep its hot hand. Two previous word-processing leaders have slipped. And new hardware, such as the set of personal computers IBM introduced last week, can lead to unexpected changes in the software business.    WordPerfect traces its roots to work its founders did designing a word-processing system for the city of Orem's Data General Corp. minicomputer system. Bruce W. Bastian, a Brigham Young University graduate student who is now chairman of WordPerfect and Alan C. Ashton, a computer science professor who is now president, kept the rights to the program.    Mr. Petersen was the office manager, earning $5 an hour, &quot;better than being a box-boy at age 30,&quot; Mr. Petersen says. After the IBM personal computer came out in 1982, Messrs. Bastian and Ashton redesigned the word processor to run on that machine.    Mr. Petersen says the company's success rests on having a good product that is managed conservatively. &quot;We've found a way to be profitable paying cash for everything,&quot; he says. The company's only debt is $73,000 used to buy company cars under the manufacturer's 3.9% financing program. And it is highly profitable. Its February sales were $6.7 million and pre-tax profit was $3.4 million -- better than a 50% profit margin.    At the beginning, WordPerfect didn't spend much money on advertising; sales grew largely through word of mouth. &quot;It was a sleeper for a long time,&quot; says Amy Wohl, a Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., office automation consultant. &quot;A couple of years ago we suddenly realized a lot of our customers were buying this product we'd never heard of.&quot;    In reaching the No. 1 spot on the word-processing software charts, WordPerfect surpassed Micropro International Corp.'s pioneering Wordstar program and Multimate, which is now owned by Ashton-Tate. Analysts say Wordstar slipped because an updated version differed sharply from the original, making customers look at other products while deciding on the new Wordstar. Multimate had surged after Wordstar because it mimicked Lowell, Mass.-based Wang Laboratories Inc.'s then popular word processor. But Multimate has slipped recently at the same time as the Wang system has fallen out of favor.    One key to WordPerfect's growth was its toll-free help line. Mr. Petersen says he figured that retailers would be reluctant to keep the $495 product on their shelves if buyers kept calling up with questions. &quot;If calls don't go to the dealer he believes the product is easy to use and recommends it,&quot; Mr. Petersen says. Today 100 of WordPerfect's 350 workers are in customer support. The company averages two help calls for every package sold.    WordPerfect says that having a word processor that eases sharing information with other computers is important. Corporate customers that have a mix of personal computers and departmental minicomputers like the fact that users can sit down at either a Digital Equipment Corp. computer or an IBM personal computer and use the same WordPerfect word-processing commands. About 40% of WordPerfect's market is in large corporations including Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Texaco Inc.    WordPerfect has ambitious plans for staying on top. It translates the software and manuals into 12 foreign languages. Besides the word processors for the IBM personal computer and compatibles, Apple Computer Inc.'s Apple IIe and minicomputers from Data General Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., it plans to bring out versions of the software for many remaining computers -- from IBM mainframes to Atari Corp.'s the Atari ST. Most software companies design for IBM or Apple's Macintosh but won't touch other machines unless the computer's maker pays for it.    But the commitment is difficult. For example, a version for the Macintosh has been delayed because WordPerfect programmers underestimated the difficulty of adapting the IBM design for the Apple machine.    Some critics fault WordPerfect for being slow to add improvements that would let the word processor do sophisticated desktop publishing. Mr. Petersen says the company is moving that way but is committed to making sure the program still works on basic IBM personal computers with floppy disks and just 256,000 bytes of memory. Although most new computers have greater memory capacity, and thus more power, WordPerfect doesn't want to shut out the big installed base of older, less potent computers.    Others complain that WordPerfect is somewhat difficult to learn. Mr. Petersen says that the very codes that make it difficult also require fewer keystrokes, making it faster to use once a typist learns the system. &quot;People talk about user-friendly software . . . (but) it always comes with a price,&quot; he says, referring to the sacrifice of speed for amiability in competing software.    Mr. Petersen expects to maintain WordPerfect's pay-as-you go tenets, which he says fit well with the religious beliefs of the founders and workers, most of whom are Mormons. The company pays generous bonuses to sales people and programmers, often topping $100,000 a year -- but it doesn't give out stock options, limiting pressure to go public. Messrs. Ashton and Bastian each hold 49.9% of the stock and Mr. Petersen is the tie-breaker, holding 0.2%.    The company president, Mr. Ashton started selling software to supplement his professor's salary and help support his 11 children. Mr. Petersen says his lifetime financial goal was to own his own house. Now, he jokes, &quot;we're making so much money that if we went public, shareholders would want to cut our salaries.&quot;    ---   Word-Processing Software Market    1986share of IBM-compatible unit sales     WordPerfect             30%    Wordstar                16%    Displaywrite            13%    Multimate               12%    PFS Write               12%    Microsoft Word          11%    Others                   6%   Source: InfoCorp., Cupertino, California </TEXT></DOC>
