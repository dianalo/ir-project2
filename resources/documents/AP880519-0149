Both George Lucas, whose ``Star Wars'' and ``Indiana Jones''movies have grossed $1 billion, and MGM, which once was Hollywood'sgreatest studio, need a hit. The movie is directed by Ron Howard,who won acclaim with ``Splash'' and ``Cocoon.''   Lucasfilm Ltd. has produced two expensive flops, ``Labyrinth''and ``Howard the Duck.'' MGM, meanwhile, is struggling to regainmomentum after several reorganizations. As a further complication,financier Kirk Kerkorian, who owns 82.4 percent of the parentMGM@UA Communications, is seeking a buyer for the company. A``Willow'' hit would enhance the price.   Despite some early negative reviews for the movie, which goesinto 1,000 theaters nationwide Friday, MGM and Lucas can be proudof their achievement. ``Willow'' is movie storytelling in the grandtradition.   No, it isn't a landmark film such as the ``Star Wars'' trilogy _the kind of achievement that happens once a decade. Much of``Willow'' may seem familiar to audiences exposed to specialeffects movies of recent years or to animated classics from Disney.   But ``Willow'' stands on its own merits as high adventureexecuted with superior imagination.   Theater owner and reviewer screenings drew mixed responses.Daily Variety called the film ``a medieval mishmash'' but predicted``kids will probably love it.'' Time magazine said: ``For now,(Lucas') wonder wand is broken.'' Newsweek's headline was: ``TheRaider of Lost Art.''   Facing blockbuster competition from ``Rambo III'' and``Crocodile Dundee II'' on May 25, MGM prudently released``Willow'' five days earlier.   ``Willow'' centers on the efforts of a brave dwarf to save ababy from the clutches of an evil queen who fears the child willdestroy her power. The hero, Willow, finds allies in anover-the-hill knight and a pair of mischievous ``brownies'' _creatures 9 inches tall.   There are no major stars in the film, which features Val Kilmer(``Top Gun''), Joanne Whalley (``Dance With a Stranger''), JeanMarsh (``Upstairs, Downstairs'') and 19-year-old Warwick Davis asWillow. The 3-foot-4 Davis was discovered by Lucas a few years agoand cast as an Ewok in ``Return of the Jedi.''   The producers count on a box-office success to help theirmassive merchandising campaign. More than 30 companies have beenlicensed to manufacture such items as ``Willow'' underwear, bedsheets, lunch boxes, meal promotion at Wendy's, coloring sets, toyaction figures, computer and board games, magic tricks, records,tapes and compact discs.   ``Willow'' resulted from a friendship between Lucas and Howard,who met 15 years ago when Lucas directed ``American Grafitti,''with Howard as one of the principal actors.   Lucas was just out of USC Film School, directing his first majorfilm under the sponsorship of his friend, Francis Coppola. Howardhad been an actor from the age of 5, working mostly in TV seriessuch as ``The Courtship of Eddie's Father,'' ``The Andy GriffithShow'' and ``Happy Days.''   They met again a few years ago. Howard recalled theirconversation in a recent interview:   Lucas: ``I'd like to do a fantasy.''   Howard: ``That's something I'd like to do.''   Lucas: ``I've always wanted to do a story that centered on alittle person.''   Howard: ``That's something I've always wanted to do, too. I'vealways been intrigued by the idea of taking a little person or therelationship of two little people and developing it so that 15 or20 minutes into the picture you'd forget completely that the personwas small.''   ``Willow'' was the result, with Lucas creating the story, BobDolman writing the script and Howard directing.   Among the director's many chores was preserving believability inthe happenings of another world.   ``Fantasy works best when everyone involved in a project _writer, producer, director and certainly the actors _ believe whatthey're doing and try to be as honest as possible,'' Howard said.   ``The actors really had to trust that it was OK to look at atalking animal and play a scene just as if that creature was animportant character in your life. Gee, they all really committed toit. That's the only way you can make a movie like this one.''   Shooting locations for ``Willow'' ranged from the glacialmountains of New Zealand to the craggy cliffs of Wales, withinteriors at the Elstree Studio near London.   The cost of ``Willow'' has been reported from $35 million to $40million, with $20 million for prints and advertising. Howarddeclined to confirm the amount.   ``This is an escapist movie, and I don't want people thinkingwhat it cost when a lot of soldiers charge down a mountain. Whenthere's an amazing special effect, I don't want them whipping outtheir pocket calculators and saying, `By my estimate ...'   ``I want them to say, `Oh, wow! What's going to happen next?'''</TEXT></DOC>
