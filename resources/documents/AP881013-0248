Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann told delegates to the43rd General Assembly that ``the problem in Central America has afirst and last name. It is called U.S. intervention.   ``When the United States stops making war on Nicaragua and stopsinvolving its lackeys in this war, then the international situationwill be immensely eased in Central America,'' D'Escoto said.   The minister claimed the reputation of the United States hadsunk to an all-time low internationally, and ``all agree that thedirty, immoral and illegal policy against Nicaragua is the basicreason for this discredit.''   ``Secretary of State (George) Shultz and a couple of his LatinAmerican friends may think differently, but that's another kettleof fish,'' D'Escoto said.   ``We were not intimidated in the military struggle against theU.S. mercenary forces. We have defeated them,'' he said, referringto the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras. The United Stateshas supported the Contra since 1981, two years after the Sandinistagovernment came to power.   Leftist rebels fighting El Salvador's U.S.-backed government andthe U.S.-backed Contras battling the Sandinistas both launch raidsfrom Honduran territory.   ``We believe that it is possible to arrive at an understandingwith the United States and normalize our bilateral relations withthat country,'' D'Escoto added. ``With the next U.S. administrationwe hope that might be possible.''   The U.S. presidential elections between Democrat MichaelDukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, and Vice President GeorgeBush, a Republican, is Nov. 8, with the winner taking office inJanuary.</TEXT></DOC>
