Racial tensions have been rising over charges of policebrutality, unfair housing practices and unequal representation.Minorities comprise more than half of Dallas' population, but thereare only two non-whites on the 11-member council.   Hoping to ease those tensions, city leaders have offered aproposed charter change to add two single-district seats, plus fourothers representing city quadrants, to give minorities a loudervoice in local government.   The plan ``provides tremendous opportunities for the racial andlanguage minorities,'' said Ray Hutchison, a white attorney whoheads the Dallas Citizens Charter Review Committee.   Minority opinion is split, but many Hispanics and most blackactivists say the proposed plan would dilute, not bolster, theirpolitical clout. They also accuse the city of rushing the issue tothe ballot in hopes of circumventing a court-ordered election plan.   It was to settle a lawsuit that the city scrapped itsall-at-large council in 1975 for the current one comprised of eightsingle-district members and three at-large, including the mayor.   Blacks _ roughly 30 percent of the city's 985,000 residents _continually have elected black council members from the city's two,largely black districts. But Hispanics, who make up more than 18percent of the city, have elected only one Hispanic from asingle-member district and one at-large member _ neither currentlyon the council. The Asian and American Indian population, about 5percent of the city, has no ethnic representative on the council.   The ``10-4-1'' proposal on the ballot would add two singledistricts and four quadrant representatives, leaving the mayor theonly at-large member.   Hutchison believes most minorities support the charter change.   ``It defies me why the media listens to the vocal opposition toa 10-4-1 plan that gives minorities the greatest opportunity toachieve racial equality,'' he said.   The charter review committee grew out of an interracial group,Dallas Together, appointed by Mayor Annette Strauss last year tohelp ease racial tensions.   Friction was growing over confrontations between minorities andpolice. Dallas officers had their deadliest year on record withfive officers slain, and several blacks and Hispanics _ some merelybystanders to crime _ were shot by police. A congressional inquiryfound no misuse of deadly force, but recommended police hire moreminorities and study alternatives to force. The inquiry did littleto calm minority fears.   Since then, protesters have marched the streets, dumped tea inthe City Hall pond, come chained and gagged to council meetings,locked arms and sung, ``We Shall Overcome,'' to council members,and chased the mayor from the chambers.   ``I've never seen our community more unified on any subjectbefore,'' said Pete Johnson, executive director of the Dallaschapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Council, a civilrights group. ``Not any black organization _ not even the BlackChamber of Commerce _ has come out in support of this plan.''   Johnson, who is black, doesn't believe minorities would gain anyrepresentation under the 10-4-1 plan. And adding council seats thatminorities might not win could dilute instead of strengthen theirpolitical power, he said.   With two seats out of 10 _ excluding the mayor _ blacks now makeup a fifth of the council. They'd lose voting strength if they hadonly two sure seats out of 14 under the 10-4-1 plan, he said.``Percentage wise ... it's crazy. I've always thought it's becausethey think we can't add.''   Some Hispanics believe they stand to gain under the proposedcharter change.   ``Right now we don't have a Chicano on the council. I think thisplan will give us the chance to have probably two,'' said ReneMartinez, a minority business activist who leads the pro-changeVote Yes for Dallas campaign.   The 10-4-1 plan is backed by the Dallas Hispanic Chamber ofCommerce.   But other Hispanics side with the black opponents.   Diana Orozco, co-chair of Dallas Citizens for Democracy, saidshe believes city leaders thought the ballot issue would help themanswer a federal lawsuit challenging the city's voting system.   The lawsuit, filed last year by two black activists, isscheduled to be heard in September. Ms. Orozco's group believes thecity needs at least 12 single-member districts to give minoritiesfair representation.   ``I think that they (city leaders) felt that by placing the10-4-1 Plan on the ballot that the federal judge would delay thematter, but that did not happen,'' Ms. Orozco said. ``I think we'rejust dividing the city on this issue and wasting money when it isin the federal courts.''</TEXT></DOC>
