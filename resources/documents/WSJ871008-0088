The move will free Bechtel from the threat of being sued by Jackson, Mich.-based CMS over construction foul-ups at another CMS nuclear plant -- the unfinished Midland, Mich., plant that is now being converted to a gas-fired cogeneration facility. San Francisco-based Bechtel was the builder of the Midland plant, which incurred huge cost overruns that had CMS, formerly Consumers Power Co., on the brink of a bankruptcy-law filing two years ago.    The agreement with closely held Bechtel appears to represent the latest bit of hurdle clearing by CMS Chairman William T. McCormick Jr., who took the helm at the troubled electric and gas utility in November 1985. Since then, Mr. McCormick has arranged to convert Midland to a cogeneration facility -- one that produces both electricity and steam -- in partnership with Dow Chemical Co. and others, and settled a bitter lawsuit with Dow over Dow's 1983 cancellation of a contract to buy steam from the Midland plant.    &quot;We're extremely pleased to have an agreement like this,&quot; Mr. McCormick said in an interview yesterday. &quot;It turns a proverbial lemon&quot; -- CMS's disputes with Bechtel -- &quot;into lemonade.&quot;    The tentative agreement announced yesterday calls for:    --CMS to sell two-thirds of its nuclear plant near South Haven, Mich., to Bechtel and other joint-venture investors for more than $400 million in cash. That amount is well above the current $311 million book value of the entire plant. The companies hope to complete the transaction by year end, and get necessary regulatory approvals by mid-1988.    --The payment of an additional $50 million from Bechtel to CMS to resolve &quot;all outstanding issues and disputed claims between the companies&quot; over the construction foul-ups at Midland. This payment is expected by year end.    --Bechtel to search for new partners to buy into the joint venture owning the Palisades plant. The search will center, Mr. McCormick said, on companies that supply the nuclear-power industry.    Wall Street reacted favorably to the announcement by CMS. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, CMS shares closed at $16.875, up 37.5 cents.    &quot;This is another smart attempt to do something (to resolve the Midland plant problem) that won't hurt ratepayers or shareholders,&quot; said Daniele Seitz, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham Co. &quot;It should be viewed positively.&quot;    CMS and Bechtel said the joint venture should allow a reduction in rates for customers, because it will seek a new rate base that assumes the Palisades plant has a higher operating rate than in the past. Since opening in 1971, the plant has operated at only 48% of capacity on averagewell below the 60% capacity considered standard for nuclear plants.    A higher operating rate should be possible, the companies said, because CMS invested in plant improvements over the past year, and because Bechtel will provide additional expertise on plant operations. A Bechtel spokesman said the company is optimistic that the plant's operating rate will be high enough to provide an investment return attractive to prospective additional partners.    If federal and state regulators approve the joint venture, it will be the first time the licensee has changed for a U.S. nuclear plant. But even if approval is granted on the Palisades plant, CMS's problems with the Midland plant will remain far from resolved.    The reason: While CMS can use a large chunk of the Midland plant's assets in the plant conversion, the utility still has an additional $2.1 billion of remaining Midland assets to recover. That issue is central to a CMS rate case pending before the Michigan Public Service Commission.    Separately, CMS said yesterday it would redeem all two million shares of its $2.43 preference stock at $26 a share, plus accrued dividends of 26 cents a share, on Nov. 10. </TEXT></DOC>
