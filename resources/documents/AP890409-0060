A Haitian doctor said about 30 soldiers _ 25 rebels and fiveloyalists _ were killed in fighting Friday and Saturday in andaround the Dessalines Barracks adjoining the National Palace.   The doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least15 soldiers supporting Haiti's military leader, Lt. Gen. ProsperAvril, were wounded. He said he had no report about the number ofrebels injured.   At least three civilians were known to have been killed in thecrossfire Saturday but officials at the city's morgues refused tosay how many bodies had been brought in.   At least six soldiers from the mutinous Leopards Battalion werekilled in battles last week with Avril's Presidential Guard.   An army communique broadcast at 5:15 p.m. Saturday declaredvictory.   It said soldiers of the Presidential Guard had occupied theDessalines Barracks and most of the rebels were captured but somefled, leaving behind their weapons and uniforms.   The government has not said how many rebels were captured orwhere they were being held.   The revolt pitted the Presidential Guard and its 1,100 troopersagainst some of the 400 members of the Leopards Battlion early lastweek, and later the soldiers of the Dessalines Barracks.   The Dessalines Barracks, with 750 troopers, was the most fearedunit in Haiti's 7,000-man army. Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholicchurch station, said the commander of the Dessalines Barracks, Col.Guy Francois, was given asylum at the Vatican Embassy. The embassydeclined comment.   Francois was identified as one of the leaders of the attemptedcoup on April 2. The three other alleged conspirators, all armyofficers, were deported last week to the United States.   Also Sunday, U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said the U.S.government has donated $25,000 to the Haitian Red Cross for medicalassistance.   The fighting with cannons, mortars, grenades, rifles and machineguns was the fiercest in Haiti's modern history.   The National Palace, a gleaming white building in the center ofPort-au-Prince, had a hole in the roof from a mortar shell and thecompound of the Dessalines Barracks was scarred by shells andbullets.   Soldiers of the Presidential Guard were smiling and casualSunday as they guarded the entrance to the barracks. Some cleanedup the debris.   ``We're proud,'' one soldier said. ``We did good work.''   Shoppers filled the streets of the capital to patronize the manymarkets and shops open for the first time in several days.   All reports indicated the fighting had occurred only inPort-au-Prince and the suburban area where the Leopards Battalionis based.   The revolt gained strength after Avril deported three officersaccused of plotting the coup _ Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, commander ofthe Leopards; Presidential Guards commander Col. Philippe Biamby,and Col. Leonce Qualo of army headquarters.   The army communique broadcast Saturday blamed the attempted coupon opponents of the government's campaign ``against drugtrafficking, contraband and corruption.'' It also said the revoltwas directed by Haitian exiles associated with ousted dictatorJean-Claude Duvalier, who fled to France in February 1986 duringviolent demonstrations.   Avril, 51, came to power last September in a coup bynoncommissioned officers that overthrew the military government ledby Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy. He has promised to hold free elections.</TEXT></DOC>
