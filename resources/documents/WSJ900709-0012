The explosion is the latest in a recent rash ofpetrochemical and oil refinery blasts that has promptedcloser scrutiny of plant operations by government, industryand union officials and tougher enforcement of safety rules.A Phillips Petroleum Co. explosion killed 23 workers inOctober at a chemical plant about a dozen miles from here.Hundreds of other workers have been injured or killed in thepast two years as such accidents seem to be on the risearound the country.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We are concerned about what is happening in thepetrochemical industry,&quot; said Gerard Scannell, head of theOccupational Safety and Health Administration, in aninterview. Mr. Scannell and OSHA investigators were on thescene at Channelview within hours of the explosion.   Industry officials are searching for answers and many havereviewed their safety practices. &quot;We can't explain thisbunching {of accidents},&quot; said Lodwrick Cook, chairman ofboth the chemical company and Atlantic Richfield Co., the oilgiant that owns 83% of the chemical company. &quot;It'stroubling.&quot;   &quot;This situation is accelerating,&quot; said Joseph Misbrener,president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union inDenver. &quot;It is definitely a crisis.&quot; The union has beendistributing a videotape narrated by Ralph Nader called &quot;Outof Control&quot; on the industry's problems.   The Arco blast occurred at a waste-water treatment tankwhere maintenance workers were about to fix a compressor,said Arco officials, who wouldn't speculate on the cause ofthe accident until the company and federal authoritiescomplete their separate investigations.   The eruption and ensuing blaze that began around 11:30Thursday night destroyed an area about the size of a cityblock at the plant. Tremors from the blast were felt formiles. It took firefighters four hours to put out the fire atthe facility here, about 20 miles east of Houston.   OSHA and industry critics have been focusing on theincreased reliance of contract workers in chemical plants andrefineries who, they say, often don't get the same trainingas company workers. Mr. Scannell said OSHA commissioned astudy, due by the end of summer, to see if there's acorrelation between the use of contract workers and safetyproblems.   Of the 17 who died here, five were Arco employees, 11 werecontract employees working for Austin Industrial Inc. and onewas a truck driver, Arco said. The plant employs about 350Arco workers and 80 contract workers full time.   Arco officials said the contract workers they use receivethe same training as Arco employees. &quot;We treat the contractemployees, who are routinely part of our work force and partof our plant, as we do our own employees,&quot; said Jack Johnson,senior vice president. Austin Industrial officials couldn'tbe reached for comment.   Union officials maintain that companies use contractworkers because they receive lower wages and benefits thanfull-time company employees. While acknowledging thatcontract workers are less expensive, Arco officials insistedthe plant uses them to maintain flexibility, not to cutcosts.   Past accident investigations have also focused on a lackof preventive maintenance, excessive overtime, inadequatesafety practices and the running of equipment at or abovecapacity.   OSHA has stepped up penalties against companies itbelieves made willful and flagrant violations. The agencylevied a $5.7 million fine against Phillips, which thecompany is contesting. In the past, OSHA penalties involvingworker deaths often totaled in the hundreds of dollars.   Arco officials said it could take several months for theentire plant to restart but that some portions could bebrought on line much sooner. The plant makes a much-in-demandgasoline additive, methyl tertiary butyl ether, which hasreceived a big environmental push because it reduces gasolineevaporation. Arco officials said production could resumewithin a few weeks, which analysts said shouldn't affect themarket.   The plant also makes propylene oxide, used to make foam inseat cushions and mattresses, and styrene monomer, used as afood-packaging material. An extended shutdown could boostprices of these chemicals, analysts said.   ---   Alex London contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
