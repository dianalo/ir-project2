Every workday now between 8:30 and 5:30, as many as 50 &quot;FaxTrax&quot; requests from Connecticut businesses slide through the station's facsimile machine. &quot;Please dedicate the Friday song to the 'Do Nothings' at Pilgrim Electronics,&quot; reads a recent submission from Danbury. &quot;Our computers have been down for 1 1/2 days.&quot;    The facsimile machine, which can send and reproduce copies of a document over telephone lines, is suddenly ubiquitous. In broadest terms, it has divided the business world into faxers and fax-nots. And as it blends into the corporate landscape, it is subtly changing how people communicate. It has, for instance, squeezed the breathing room that mailing allows. It has also helped to fuel the impatience that comes with automation.    &quot;There was the Federal Express revolution, where you had to have everything before 10:30 in the morning,&quot; says Mark White, a Birmingham, Ala., lawyer. &quot;Now we've reached the level where we can't tolerate even that.&quot;    The facsimile machine, invented in the 1840s but grown vastly more sophisticated in recent years, began its latest boom in Japan, where modern times demanded quick visual reproduction of a language with thousands of characters. Steve Joerg, vice president of sales for fax machines at Ricoh Co. of Japan's U.S. subsidiary, says the Japanese also like to fax because their business culture encourages last-minute decision making and relies on consensus.    With a projected 1.5 million fax machines in use in the U.S. by the end of the year, the technology's brief life as a competitive advantage is nearly over. &quot;Like a lot of modern technology, if everyone gets it, it just becomes a condition of doing business,&quot; says JoAnne Yates, a senior lecturer in communications at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's School of Management.    Few business people are as aware of how entrenched fax machines have become as those without one. Mary Frances Rhodes, a Silver Spring, Md., lawyer, must run across the street to borrow the machine at a neighboring office. She says that, talking on the phone, she sometimes meets with surprised silence when she tells a would-be faxer she doesn't have a machine of her own.    When a company goes without a fax machine, &quot;you kind of wonder what's wrong -- a gap in management sophistication?&quot; says Mark Eisen, director of marketing for Retail Planning Associates in Columbus, Ohio.    One of the great virtues of faxing is that it combines speed with useful &quot;visual cues,&quot; says M.I.T.'s Ms. Yates. She explains that like a letter -- and unlike electronic &quot;mail&quot; sent by computers -- fax lets the sender signal &quot;different levels of formality&quot; by choosing between typing and handwriting, and among corporate letterhead, personal stationery or sheets from a memo pad.    Cover-sheet style ranges from the institutional -- the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago includes its logo and a picture of the bank -- to the personal: Loretta Marbury, a secretary in the public-relations office of ABC News in Washington, says she puts &quot;I'm Faxing&quot; at the top of her cover sheets to get people's attention.    Faxing is particularly appealing for international communications. Besides offering the comfort of &quot;having it spelled out in a document,&quot; and the freedom to communicate despite time differences, faxing promotes a &quot;much more direct&quot; exchange, says Craig Murphy, a professor of political science at Wellesley College. While mailed letters from abroad often include a lot of verbal bowing and scraping, he notes, faxing encourages a straightforward memorandum style.    Despite the machine's charms, however, there are those who aren't going gently into the age of fax. Mr. White, the Alabama lawyer, complains that faxing has destroyed a precious period of communications float. When sending something by mail or even overnight express, he says, &quot;you'd get it off your desk and wouldn't have to deal with it for 48 hours. Now it's back to you in 10 minutes.&quot;    Moreover, because of its ease, the faxing habit feeds on itself, adds Charlie Jortberg, an office-automation consultant in Peabody, Mass., who hasn't bought his own machine. &quot;There is a self-fulfilling prophecy,&quot; he says. &quot;Everything has to be done at the last minute.&quot;    Paul R. Krugman, a professor of economics at M.I.T., says that when he began faxing frequently last year, he thought it had &quot;added three days to my life&quot; by letting him finish a paper that much closer to deadline. But within weeks, he recalls, &quot;I'd already factored that in.&quot;    Kathy Lang-Albright, director of marketing for Bartlett andamp; Co., a Cincinnati investment firm, points out yet another drawback to the speed of a fax machine: Whereas writing a letter takes a while to compose, type, seal in an envelope and stamp, she says, &quot;fax gives you less time for second thoughts.&quot;    To make sure its employees don't go overboard with faxing, Robert Half International Inc., a personnel-services concern based in San Francisco, decided to &quot;impose some discipline.&quot; A memo was sent out last December -- by mail -- outlining &quot;fax etiquette,&quot; says Robert Glass, vice president for corporate development at the company, which has installed some 60 facsimile machines in its offices and two in top executives' homes.    &quot;As a matter of courtesy,&quot; the memo said, employees shouldn't send faxes unless clients request them or give their approval beforehand. Mr. Glass explains that a fax, partly be cause it carries a suggestion of urgency, is &quot;a little more intrusive&quot; than a letter and shouldn't be used for what may be viewed on the other end as a &quot;routine&quot; communication.    Mr. Glass notes, too, that because many people dislike the slick feel of the special paper used in most machines, faxed resumes don't have &quot;the same shelf life&quot; as those printed on bond. For this reason, the memo suggested following up such faxes by mail. The memo also recommended against faxing anything confidential without first warning the client.    Indeed, because fax machines are often installed in the mail room or some central location, they can raise security problems. Experienced users say they are amazed at the material some people send, apparently without regard for who will see it at the other end. Mr. White, the lawyer, says he worked at a real-estate firm where faxes would arrive without a cover sheet and be read widely until somebody figured out who should get it -- or that it was meant for another destination entirely.    &quot;The stuff that really got passed around was the gossip, more than the state secrets,&quot; he recalls, adding that one fax arrived containing &quot;personal allegations.&quot;    The more advanced machines now store communications, which recipients retrieve by punching in a code or using a passkey. Some machines can also load the material into a personal computer, where it will wait until the user calls it up.    Manufacturers, who would like to see a fax machine on every desk, have started selling &quot;personal&quot; faxes for executives. Mr. Eisen of Retail Planning says many executives at his firm do fax for themselves. &quot;They see it as an extension of their phone,&quot; he says.    But M.I.T.'s Ms. Yates says the jury is still out on &quot;whether it will be viewed as a secretarial or a managerial tool.&quot;    At Eckert Seamans Cherin andamp; Mellott in Pittsburgh, the lawyers don't go near the fax. &quot;Lawyers are trained to practice law,&quot; says C.J. Parks, the firm's executive director. &quot;We don't want them involved in support services.&quot;    Nor has anyone yet solved the problem of fax junk mail. Mr. Joerg of Ricoh says fax operators in mail rooms around the country are reaping bounties of videocassette recorders, fur coats and other merchandise for turning over to marketers or fax-directory publishers the logs of the numbers called by their machines.    But such issues aren't slowing the growth of fax. When a business can deliver documents almost instantaneously, &quot;people think you're a miracle worker,&quot; says Ms. Lang-Albright. &quot;Of course,&quot; she adds, &quot;then they want another miracle.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
