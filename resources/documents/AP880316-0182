President Reagan's chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, saidPresident Jose Azcona of Honduras had requested U.S. assistance todeal with the invasion. Asked whether this included a plea formilitary help, he replied, ``I can't say.''   Fitzwater said Secretary of State George Shultz, nationalsecurity adviser Colin Powell and White House chief of staff HowardH. Baker Jr., were dispatched to Capitol Hill to briefcongressional leaders. He said they would ``review a menu ofoptions and will probably make decisions after that.''   Reagan, meantime, said ``obviously we're concerned'' about theincursion reports _ confirmed by the Honduran ambassador to theUnited States but neither confirmed nor denied by Nicaragua. But healso sidestepped questions about possible use of U.S. militaryforces.   Fitzwater said both U.S. military and diplomatic moves werebeing considered in response to the reports, which surfaced as theadministration made fresh appeals to Congress for continued aid tothe Contras in their battle against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistagovernment.   Asked whether consideration was being given to using U.S. troopsin Central America, Reagan said, ``I can't comment on anything.''He said only that officials had been ``in consultation'' with theHonduran government.   Fitzwater at first told reporters ``nothing is being ruled outat this point.'' But he quickly revised that, saying: ``At thismoment everything is being considered, short of invasion.''   During a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with visitingIsraeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Reagan said ``theinformation we have is that Nicaragua has crossed the border intoHonduras.''   The president, who had held a series of strategy sessions withkey advisers, invited several congressional leaders to the WhiteHouse to discuss the situation, said sources who declined to beidentified.   Fitzwater later told reporters that Reagan made ``some tentativedecisions about what the options are and what seems to be the mostreasonable course.''   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said, meantime, said he couldnot immediately evaluate the incursion reports.   ``If true, that would be a very serious matter and wouldintroduce an element of gravity that could profoundly alter thesituation,'' including the willingness of Congress to vote forfurther aid of some kind for the rebels, Wright told reporters.   But he said he still does not believe support exists in Congressfor any kind of renewed military aid for the rebels, and repeatedthat congressional Democrats remain willing to talk about a furtherpackage of purely ``humanitarian'' aid.   The Honduran ambassador, Roberto Martinez, said there had been a``penetration into Honduran territory of a number, ... definitelyin the thousands, of Sandinista troops. At this moment, we aretrying the utmost to obtain a clearing of the area, ... a totalwithdrawal, immediate withdrawal, of the Sandinista troops from ourterritory.''   But he said his government hoped to avoid military action.   In Managua, the Defense Ministry declined to confirm or denythat its troops entered Honduran territory but acknowledged that amajor offensive was under way.   ``We're looking into the reports,'' said an officer in theministry's public relations office who spoke on condition ofanonymity. ``It's serious and that's why I can't say yes or no.''   Another ministry source had denied the incursion reports Tuesdaynight.   Some 12,500 American military personnel are stationed in CentralAmerica, including roughly 10,000 are located in Panama. Total U.S.military manpower in Honduras varies from week to week, dependingupon the exercises being conducted.   A headquarters unit in Honduras coordinates the exercises hasabout 1,100 personnel assigned to it. Beyond that, there are about950 National Guard and Army Reserve engineers working on trainingexercises inside Honduras, far from the border area.   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said he could notbe more precise about the number of Nicaraguan troops in Hondurasbeyond ``on the order of thousands.''   ``I hate to see unusual attention drawn to the fact of whetherthe exact number is 4,000, 4,200, 4,700 or 5,300,'' he said. ``Thefact of the matter is, that we have a major Sandinista offensiveunder way.   ``It's been described as such by the Nicaraguan government on anumber of occasions now. Just yesterday, President (Daniel) Ortegawas talking about two major offensives.''   Redman said that inside Nicaragua, the Sandinista forces areusing ``much superior firepower,'' including Soviet-supplied AN-26aircraft, close support from artillery and rockets and MI-25 attackhelicopters.   Besides the operation in the Bocay Valley there is a``multi-batallion operation under way in the vicinity of Bonanza''in Nicaragua, he said.   Redman said the United States is committed to help Honduras``preserve territorial sovereignty and national integrity. We're invery close consultation with the government of Honduras.''   Fitzwater did not spell out what options were being considered,but he said ``the Organization of American States will be asked toconsider the issue, and the presidents of Guatemala, Costa Rica andEl Salvador will present their views.''</TEXT></DOC>
