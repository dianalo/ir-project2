DEA spokesman Maurice Hill in Washington, D.C., said thetechnique is employed in high drug traffic areas across the country,including Florida and Texas, the Houston Chronicle reported Sunday.   ``It's a procedure that is used, but I can't begin to tell youwith what frequency,'' Hill told the newspaper. ``It's not a newtechnique, I can tell you that.''   Staging bogus seizures and feeding the information to reportersapparently came into practice several years ago to resolve a problemfor undercover drug agents posing as cocaine importers for Colombiandrug lords, according to the Chronicle.   Often the DEA operatives, posing as middlemen, deliver the drugsto local dealers according to instructions from Colombian exporters.They then keep the shipment under surveillance in the hope ofintercepting it before it hits the streets, officials said.   But the DEA sometimes ensures that drugs never reach the streetanother way, the newspaper reported: by having local authoritiesseize the drugs before they are delivered to the local dealers. Insome cases, even the officers making the seizures don't realize thatbusts were planned in advance by their superiors.   Newspaper clippings on the fake seizures help convince thetraffickers that the seizures are for real, according to theChronicle, which determined that at least two highly publicizedseizures in the Houston area had been staged.   ``The Colombians, the only way they'll believe you is to showthem the stuff (drugs), the money or the newspaper clips,'' Hillsaid.   Harris County Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen, whose office cooperatedin at least two staged seizures, said local police agencies use thetactic only at the request of the DEA. He praised the bogus seizuresas ``very productive in taking illicit drugs off the street.''   He added that withholding information is a common policeprocedure, and that it does not constitute lying for officers towithhold the true origin of drugs when discussing a staged seizure.   While many law enforcement agencies defend the ruses on groundsthat they preserve investigations and protect agents, journalistssay the scams raise ethical questions about government deception ofthe news media and the public.   ``If the DEA is willing to lie to the media and public about thisissue, what else might they be willing to lie about?'' askedChronicle Managing Editor Tony Pederson.   ``There seems to have been no accountability in the entireprocess,'' Pederson added. ``At least some type of judicial reviewhas always been necessary for other elements of law enforcementdeception, the key example being wiretaps. But who, if anyone, hasreviewed this process?''   Paul LaRocque, an assistant journalism professor at SouthernMethodist University in Dallas, asked, ``How can the public trustwhat they read in the paper, if the paper has been converted to anarm of government?''   The newspaper described two phony seizures in the Houston area.   In 1984, DEA agents helped smuggle 952 pounds of cocaine intoHarris Country, then abandoned the van containing the contraband ata prearranged roadblock set up by the Texas Department of PublicSafety, the Chronicle reported. On Aug. 2, 1984, the public safetydepartment alerted news reporters that troopers had found a cache ofdrugs described at the time as one of Texas' largest seizures.   On Sept. 29 of this year, 60 kilograms of cocaine was planted inan abandoned car at another spot in Harris County, and left to bediscovered by deputy sheriffs, who notified reporters.   Alan Spears, one of the state troopers who made the 1984 seizure,said he never was told that it was staged.   ``The poor little officer who finds the stuff thinks he's goingto be named officer of the year,'' the newspaper quoted a source assaying. ``Sometimes you have to push them with a stick to find thestuff.''</TEXT></DOC>
