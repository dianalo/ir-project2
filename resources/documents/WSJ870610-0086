And so the man credited with sharply cutting the value of the dollar learned firsthand what other American tourists have been complaining about.    During this week's economic summit, Mr. Baker and other visitors have been assaulted by a combination of summit-gouging and the anemic dollar. A room at the Hotel Excelsior is going for $360 a night. A box of 24 Pampers disposable diapers runs for about $17 just off St. Mark's Square, and water taxis are renting for at least $800 a day.    But while the industrial world's leaders aren't likely to either boost the value of the dollar or do anything else to ease the abnormally high Venetian prices this week, Mr. Baker has found a way to escape the pain. During a recent excursion to the nearby island of Murano, he left behind the summit crowds and tight security and found a cafe lunch for $5.    Some of the other summit participants also have found ways to escape, at least for a while. French President Francois Mitterrand kept his aides and several dozen reporters waiting for more than an hour Monday when he took an after-dinner midnight stroll through moonlit Venice, in order to &quot;get his thoughts together,&quot; according to an aide.    And West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl enjoyed an anonymous evening at a public cafe, without being disturbed, while nearby crowds thronged around American television correspondent Sam Donaldson as he reported the news from St. Mark's. Chancellor Kohl visited the same square early the next morning, attending mass in St. Mark's Basilica, unremarked and virtually unguarded.    Such idylls are amazing, given the intense security on land and water in this community of 117 islands. Young Italian police officers with their fingers on the triggers of machine guns seem to be stationed every 100 feet, both on land and in high-powered boats on the canals. The Grand Canal is closed temporarily to the gondoliers, who are seeking reparations from the Venice authorities for their lost opportunities.    Some of these estimated 8,000 police and military officers are required to sleep on boats, and they have complained about unsanitary conditions. But the White House staff hasn't been thrilled with its more luxurious accommodations either. Until they moved to the lavish Hotel Cipriani, where the Reagans are staying, some senior staff officials complained that their hotel was filled with geriatrics having mud-bath treatments.    Despite the best efforts of professional linguists, some things here defy translation. One restaurant menu in the Rialto area said in English that spaghetti with clams was $5.50, while spaghetti with &quot;genuine clams&quot; was $8. The slowest water bus is labeled the &quot;accelerato.&quot;    Even as some Venetians grumble about the foreign invasion, others display the continuing power of American culture. Boston Celtics T-shirts are all the rage, and in the era of the James Baker dollar they cost only $23 here. </TEXT></DOC>
