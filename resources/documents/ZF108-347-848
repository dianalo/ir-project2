Gamble Co., the advent ofCBT is revolutionary.andM;&quot;CBT will be the core of our training programs in the future,&quot; said JimPalmer, senior manager of worker's compensation at household-productsconglomerate Procter andamp; Gamble in Cincinnati.andP;  &quot;We will still use other formsof training, but they will be used around the CBT concept.&quot;andM;Palmer and other training managers at the recent Weingarten Computer BasedTraining Conference in Chicago said the factors selling them on CBT aftertheir early reluctance include:andM;-- the ability to create bite-sized lessons that are easy to remember;andM;-- improved authoring systems that speed up the development process;andM;-- CBT's ability to reinforce traditional &quot;stand-up,&quot; or instructor-based,training;andM;-- the entry into the workplace of a growing number of experienced PC users;andM;-- and the spread of PCs across the enterprise.andM;Novell, the networking-software developer based in Provo, Utah, has justcompleted beta testing of CBT 386, a computer-based course it plans to offerthis quarter to resellers and users of NetWare 386.andM;The firm is so pleased with the initial product that more CBT courses are onthe drawing board.andM;&quot;CBT is not a replacement for stand-up training,&quot; said Mike Sikalis, Novell'svice president of services.andP;  &quot;I personally learn better the old-fashionedway.andP;  But there are some who learn better at the computer or fromvideo-training programs.andP;  We are exploring ways to build on what we achievedwith CBT 386.&quot;andM;Some industry observers think the use of CBT has been held back while thetechnology matured.andM;&quot;Some of the early versions of CBT were wretchedly difficult for the user tonavigate and for the author to use&quot; to write courses, said Lance Dublin, CEOof Dublin Associates Inc., a training consulting firm in San Francisco.andP;  &quot;Butif you look around the floor of this year's CBT exposition, you see a lot ofthings running on Windows and you see a lot of object-oriented tools.&quot;andM;Although most Fortune 500 firms have begun testing the CBT waters, they aremoving cautiously, in large part because so much of the technology is new andevolving and there is little expertise within the corporate structure.andM;For its plunge into CBT, Novell hired Drake Training andamp; Technologies Co. --andO;formerly the Industrial Training Division of Control Data Corp. -- ofMinneapolis, which sells tools to help authors write CBT courses.andP;  Novell'sSikalis said the two companies are working together on several other projectsthat will be announced later this year.andM;&quot;We see training as a critical support tool,&quot; said Sikalis.andP;  &quot;And CBT itselfrequires some specific skills that are not easy to find.andP;  That's partly whywe chose an outside vendor to work with us.&quot;andM;&quot;Training is going to be the key management issue of the 1990s,&quot; said BillPollack, CEO of Drake International Inc., a Toronto-based human-resourcesfirm and the parent company of Drake Training andamp; Technologies.andM;&quot;In America, there will be several compelling reasons,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Increasedautomation and the growing problems of illiteracy are already causingproductivity problems in the workplace.andP;  In manufacturing, the growth ofautomation makes training an important safety issue.andP;  Lives are at stake.&quot;andM;Dublin, however, said the issue will take time to gain attention becauseexecutives don't understand CBT or training in general.andM;&quot;As they begin to see that it isn't really training they want, I thinkthey'll embrace CBT,&quot; said Dublin.andP;  &quot;But they will embrace it as performancesystems -- systems that increase productivity and improve performance in somemeasurable way.&quot;andM;More than 1,000 information-systems managers and training managers gatheredin Chicago recently for the Weingarten Computer Based Training conference.andO;The following topics were among the highlights.andM;HiringandM;Before hiring someone who will report directly to you, make sure you write ajob description.andP;  Ron Munger, manager of training development at NationwideInsurance Co. in Columbus, Ohio, told one conference seminar that most poorhires are made because there was no formal job description for theprospective employee.andM;&quot;If you don't have a job description for yourself, what will you base yourexpectations on?&quot;andM;Munger also suggests structuring the job interview such that the questionsare written down for the interviewer and a specific amount of time isallotted for each question.andP;  The structure, he said, doesn't have to berigid.andM;&quot;Ask open-ended questions, the kind that can't be answered with a simple Yesor No,&quot; he said.andM;TrainingandM;&quot;Never use the 'T' word,&quot; warned Lance Dublin, CEO of the Dublin Group Inc.,andO;a training-consulting firm in San Francisco.andM;The 'T' is for training, and Dublin told a packed seminar that corporateworkers, particularly executives, &quot;hate the idea of training or education.&quot;andO;That's why most training never works, he said.andM;&quot;Most of us associate the words training or education with experiences we hadin junior high school,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;An autocrat -- a dictator -- stands infront of a blackboard and pummels you with facts for 40 minutes.&quot;andM;To avoid the terror, Dublin made several suggestions for those who do theteaching: Think of it as learning rather than training; let the learner leadthe discussion; don't use computer-based training as a mere substitute forpaper or videotape.andM;&quot;That last point may not be meaningful in the business world until theNintendo generation takes over,&quot; Dublin said, pointing out that workers inthe pre-Nintendo era often have some degree of computer phobia.andP;  Even witholder workers, however, computer-based training can be made effective iflearning programs are designed specifically for the medium.andM;ConsultantsandM;Hiring a training consultant can be risky business, said Lillian Maremont,manager of Corporate Training at Visa USA Inc., in San Mateo, Calif.andP;  Visa isa Dublin Associates client.andM;&quot;The biggest problem with the consultancies we've looked over is they relytoo heavily on contract workers,&quot; she said.andP;  When a contract teacher is outsick, the replacement who comes in often loses momentum.andM;The teaching method used at Visa was to keep lessons &quot;short and sweet,&quot; saidMaremont.andM;This proved particularly important to executives.andP;  For some hard-to-pin-downmanagers, classes were held one-on-one.andP;  &quot;In those instances, we taught themanagers only what they asked to learn.&quot;andM;EducationandM;Literacy training is becoming increasingly important to corporate executiveswho want to improve company safety records, accelerate training and competein an international marketplace, Pollack said at last week's conference.andM;His words echoed those recently spoken by Lester Thurow, dean of the SloanSchool of Management, who said that &quot;in a global economy, you can't make anAmerican wage with a Korean education.&quot;andM;Pollack said American corporations spend less than 1 percent of their incomeon education and need to &quot;improve the skills of their employees if they wantto compete with a United Europe or a more competitive Eastern bloc.&quot;
