It said the move wouldsave 120 lives and prevent 60,000 injuries a year.   The rule issued by the department's Occupational Safety andHealth Administration would add protections for 39 million workers,3 million of whom are at the greatest risk because they servicemachinery, the government said.   OSHA said employers must guarantee that the machinery cannot beaccidentally activated during repairs and maintenance and thatworkers cannot be exposed to electrical current during that work.   The rule requires most employers to guarantee the protection byinstalling locks that cut machines off from their power supply. Itwill cost the affected establishments $214 million in the next yearfor the necessary equipment and training and $135 million insubsequent years, OSHA said. Those costs will range from $120 forsmall establishments _ such as a small print shop _ to $28,000 forlarge plants with scores of machines, OSHA said.   The regulation, a decade in the making, is tougher in its finalform than when proposed. The government initially said employerscould either install locks to prevent accidental activation ofequipment during repairs or place warning tags on the power sourceto alert workers that the machinery was being worked on and was notto be activated.   The final rule places a greater emphasis on locks, allowing tagsonly when an employer can prove that equipment cannot be ``locked''off a power supply or that its tag program is as effective as usinglocks. Because of the additional training required to meet thatthreshold, it would cost employers more to use tags than it would toinstall locks, said Alan McMillan, acting OSHA chief. He said 90percent of electrically powered machinery is capable of being locked.   ``We have so many fatalities, loss of fingers, crushed bones andother serious injuries because these precautions are not taken,''McMillan said in an interview. ``This will have a major effect onworkplace safety.''   The provision allowing use of tags will not apply to newequipment or machines that are taken off line for majormodifications, McMillan said. In those cases, locks must be used.   The rule, which takes effect Oct. 31, also requires annualtraining of all affected workers. Employers also must inventory allequipment covered by the rule and establish a written plan forcutting off power during repairs.   The standard applies to most machinery used in manufacturing andin services such as industrial laundries. OSHA data show thatpackaging and wrapping equipment, printing presses and conveyorsaccount for a high proportion of accidents blamed on a failure tocut off power during major maintenance and repairs. Typicalaccidents in such situations include electrocution and shock andgetting limbs caught in moving parts when a machine lurches on.   The rules do not apply to construction or maritime industries. Asis its custom, OSHA will use separate rulemaking procedures totailor the requirments to those industries. Separate standards alsoare being developed for utilities.</TEXT></DOC>
