Fourteen yearslater, I wonder if it will ever end.   In 1975, my colleagues in The Associated Press and I huddledunder desks as rockets tore through the office. Last week, we wereagain sprawled beneath our metal desks as shells exploded around us.   The AP has been shelled out of four offices through the years ofbombardment, invasions and sieges, car bombings and assassinations.   For the last two months, army commander Gen. Michel Aoun'smainly Christian forces have battled the powerful Syrian army andits Moslem allies in a quixotic crusade to force the Syrians out ofLebanon and try to reunite a country dismembered into sectarianfiefdoms.   More than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 woundedin indiscriminate artillery, rocket and tank barrages that beganMarch 8.   That doesn't compare with the savage battles at the start of thewar, when more than 100 people were killed daily. Since the warbegan, an estimated 150,000 people have been killed, twice as manyhave been wounded.   The economy is in tatters.   One quarter of the pre-war population of 4 million has fled.Others are leaving every day now to start anew somewhere else withwhatever assets they can salvage.   For many Lebanese, the latest fighting has forced them to cowerin underground shelters without sleep, electricity, running wateror decent food. Their children weep in fear.   It has been the final descent into terror and degradation.   Since the war began, I've seen the Syrian army come and go andreturn, the Israelis invade and withdraw, U.S. Marines come ashoreto join French foreign legionnaires, plumed Italian Bersaglieritroops and British paratroopers in an ill-fated effort to bringpeace.   But Lebanon's warlords, and the Arab governments who for theirown reasons aid and arm them, defied them all to go on waging thesuicidal conflicts that have left the country in ruins.   When the Americans and the Multi-National Force eventuallywithdrew in 1984, with hundreds of their men killed or wounded bysuicide car bombers, everyone thought things had hit rock bottom.   But the current fighting has been far more demoralizing becauseit has demonstrated with such destructive force that nothing haschanged and probably never will.   On both sides of Beirut's dividing Green Line, Christians andMoslems speak of their disgust at the carnage and bemoan a futureseemingly without hope.   Beirut was once the most glamorous capital in the Middle Eastand bustled with thousands of Western businessmen and fun-seekingArab oil shieks lured by the great beachside casino and luxuryhotels.   Now, it is shrouded in despair.   For nearly a decade and a half, the Lebanese have pickedthemselves up after every catastrophe and somehow found the will torebuild, patch up their lives and businesses and carry on.   That remarkable spirit is almost drained. Everyone has hadenough.   The war, with its undertones of medieval religious conflicts andendless factional feuds on both sides of the sectarian divide, hasbecome as incomprehensible to the average Lebanese as it has longbeen to the outside world.   There are no heroes or villains, no winners or losers any more.Only victims.   The carnage is all-embracing. President-elect Bashir Gemayel,Prime Minister Rashid Karami, warlords, legislators and poets haveperished in the Lebanese bloodbath along with thousand uponthousand of helpless civilians.   For the estimated 1 million Christians, the last few weeks havemost traumatic. They have been bombarded day and night in theirshrunken coastal enclave north of Beirut by Syria's big guns.   Beleaguered and outnumbered, Aoun has refused to back down fromhis battle to rid Lebanon of Syrian forces.   The Syrians and their Moslem allies want the Christians, whohave dominated government, the judiciary and the army sinceindependence from France in 1943, to share power with the Moslems.   For many Christians, particularly the dominant Maronite Catholicsect, this means Syrian overlordship and the surrender of theirtraditional privileges.   Nothing has escaped the latest shelling. Churches, hospitals,schools, apartment blocks, factories, power stations, fuel depotsand even shepherds in their fields in the hills above Beirut haveall been hit.   Thousands of homes in west Beirut, including my apartment, havebeen devastated. Every day we hear of friends killed, neighborsburied beneath the rubble of their homes, whole families wiped out.   We have no electricity or running water.   Hospitals are running short of medicine.   The power stations ran out of fuel for their generators weeksago. The last fuel supplies went up in flames when Syrian shellsdestroyed the main depot in east Beirut.   The French, the only Europeans to significantly respond toAoun's appeals for aid, sent 6,000 tons of fuel. That was enough toprovide power for about 2 million Lebanese for two hours a day for10 days.   Everyone has seen worse.   The current violence _ frightful though it is _ is nothingcompared to the destruction wrought by the Israelis when theyinvaded 1982 and besieged the Moslem sector, or compared to the thecolossal losses of 1975-76.   Christian sources say Aoun has come to realize that hisDavid-and-Goliath war against the Syrians is unwinnable. He ishaving to make most of the concessions to help the Arab Leagueenforce a cease-fire and end the carnage.   Many support the general, who is aided by Iraqi weapons, forfinally standing up to the Syrians, not just for the Christians butalso for Moslems who would rather see them gone as well.   But many of Aoun's people are increasingly critical of why hedecided to fight in the first place, embarking on what many see asa reckless, impetuous crusade against a foe 10 times as powerful.   But the 54-year-old general, a U.S.-trained artillery officermany Christians now call ``Napol-Aoun,'' cannot back down withoutsurrending the besieged Christians' last card.   Equally, Syria's President Hafez Assad, beset by political andeconomic problems, cannot meekly march his troops out of a countrythe Syrians consider their own backyard without a loss of face inthe Arab world.   For the Lebanese, this means a future _ if such is the word _that holds only more misery, destruction and savagery.</TEXT></DOC>
