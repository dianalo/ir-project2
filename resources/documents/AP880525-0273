Pro-Iranian guerrillas reported 25 of their fighterskilled and 20 missing.   Police also said four Israeli helicopter gunships rocketed thePalestinian refugee camp Ein el-Hilweh on Sidon's outskirts lateWednesday, killing a PLO guerrilla and wounding four.   The helicopters, dropping parachute flares, destroyed a base ofthe mainstream Fatah guerrilla faction of Yasser Arafat's PalestineLiberation Organization in the 10:05 p.m. (4:05 p.m. EDT) strike,police said.   The Israeli army command in Jerusalem later announced thatIsraeli warplanes hit the Ein el-Hilweh base at about 11 p.m. andscored accurate hits despite anti-aircraft fire.   Despite discrepancies, the Israeli and the Lebanese accountsapparently were referring to the same air strike.   Earlier in the day, Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran's main allyin Lebanon, said 25 of its men were killed in a daylong sweep bythe South Lebanon Army militia supported by Israeli helicoptergunships.   A Hezbollah statement issued in Beirut said 17 guerillas werewounded and 20 were missing. The predominantly Christian SLA saidfive of its fighters were injured.   The assault on three villages in south Lebanon began at daybreakand ended at nightfall, when the attacking force rolled back to itsbase in Israel's self-designated ``security zone,'' the SLA's Voiceof the South radio station said.   Lebanon instructed its U.N. mission to ``lodge a strong wordedcomplaint against the Israeli-sponsored aggression'' with theSecurity Council, an official statement said.   The action in the south came as Hezbollah concentrated itsefforts on the battle for control of Shiite Moslem slums in southBeirut.   Syria reportedly warned Hezbollah not to harm any of the 18foreign hostages _ including nine Americans _ believed held in theslums, site of a bloody 20-day battle between Hezbollah and thepro-Syrian Amal militia.   The Beirut newspaper An-Nahar said Syria told Hezbollah thatharming any of the hostages would be viewed as an ``infringement ofSyria's security.''   It gave no source for its report and did not elaborate. Syrianspokesmen declined comment.   The captive held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was captured on March 16,1985.   A Belgian physician, Dr. Jan Cools, was reported missingWednesday in south Lebanon, but there was no word on whether he hadbeen kidnapped.   The Norwegian Aid Committee said Cools, 32, a generalpractitioner, left the Qasimiyeh refugee camp on Saturday, headingfor the Rashidiyeh shantytown eight miles to the south. He neverreached Rashidiyeh.   On Tuesday, Hezbollah consolidated its grip on more than 90percent of south Beirut.   Syrian troops and tanks surround the slums and Syria hasthreatened to move in and stop the battle.   Lebanon's acting prime minister, Salim Hoss, drove to Damascusfor a meeting with Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam of Syria.Sources close to Hoss said he asked that the Syrian army be sentinto the slums and that Hussein Husseini, speaker of Lebanon'sParliament, was expected to make a similar plea.   Syria is Tehran's main Arab ally but has been alarmed by Iran'sattempt through Hezbollah to dominate Lebanon's 1.2 millionShiites, the largest sect in the country.   The intensity of the south Beirut slum war decreasedsignificantly Wednesday, with only automatic weapons fire reported.Police said they had no word on casualties.   The fighting has killed 296 people and wounded 1,000 since May 6.   A police spokesman said Hezbollah was reorganizing its forces,apparently preparing ``for a final push'' against Shiyah, Amal'slast stronghold in the 16 square miles of slums.</TEXT></DOC>
