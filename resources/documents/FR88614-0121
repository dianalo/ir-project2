The statute required that regulations governing the temporary alienagricultural worker H-2A program provisions be promulgated in interim finalform no later than June 1, 1987. The regulations were published by theDepartment of Labor in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 1 1987 at 20 CFR, Part 655, Subpart B.They were effective upon publication and govern all employer applicationsfor temporary alien agricultural worker certifications filed on or afterJune 1. The public comment period on the interim final rule has expired,and it is probable that final regulations will be promulgated in 1988.4. <T3>The Handbook. </T3>The handbook has three sections: (1) Operating procedures;(2) special items; and (3) appendices. It is intended to supplement theregulations by providing guidance to SESAs and Regional Offices involvedin day-to-day program operations, and must be used in conjunction withthe regulations. If future regulatory action results in changes to programoperating procedures, the handbook will be amended to conform to the regulations.The handbook supersedes General Administration Letter No. 46-81, and changesandplusmin;1 and andplusmin;2 to General Administration Letter No. 46-81. TheEmployment and Training Administration intends to publish the handbookas an informational notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. 5. <T3>Action Required. </T3>Regional and State Administrators should distributethe handbook to all staff who are or may be involved in H-2A program activities.6. <T3>Inquiries. </T3>State agencies should direct inquiries to the appropriateRegional Office.

Theprogram establishes a means for agricultural employers who anticipate ashortage of domestic workers to apply for permission to bring into theUnited States nonimmigrant aliens to perform agricultural labor or servicesof a temporary or seasonal nature. Under the statute, the Attorney General,through the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), has the authorityfor approving an employer's petition to import foreign workers. Beforethe INS can approve an employer's petition, however, the law requires theemployer to apply to the Department of Labor (DOL) for a certificationthat_<ITAG tagnum="21">``* * * there are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, andqualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed, to performthe labor or services involved in the petition, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``* * * the employment of the alien in such labor or services willnot adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in theUnited States similarly employed.''</ITAG>Under Federal Regulations at CFR Part 655, Subpart B, the Department ofLabor has established procedures and a systematic process to acquire informationsufficient to carry out the requirements of the law. The regulations providethe Department's methodology for the two-fold factual determination onthe availability of domestic workers and of any adverse effect which wouldbe occasioned by the use of foreign workers for particular temporary andseasonal agricultural jobs in the United States. Most of the day-to-day operational responsibility for the program has beendelegated in the regulations to the Regional Offices of the Employmentand Training Administration and the State Employment Security agencies.Operating guidelines in the handbook are designed to supplement the regulations,and must be used in conjunction with them. Throughout the handbook appropriatesections of the regulations have been reproduced and placed adjacent tothe text for ready reference.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Table of Contents ommitted.) <ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter I_Program Operating Procedures </ITAG>A. Filing of Applications <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Who Can Apply </ITAG>a. <T3>Employers in Agriculture. </T3>Employers desiring to apply for temporaryalien agricultural labor certification for the employment of H-2A workersmust meet the definitional indicia of the regulations at 20 CFR 655.100.This part defines ``agricultural labor or services'' by incorporating thedefinitions for ``agricultural labor'' and ``agriculture'' appearing inSection 3121(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (i.e., the FICA orSocial Security tax definition) and Section 3(f) of the Fair Labor StandardsAct. b. <T3>Employers with Temporary Jobs. </T3>The regulations at 20 CFR 655.100(c)(2)include a definition for ``seasonal or other temporary employment'' whichis consistent with MSPA provisions. The regulations also adopt for H-2Acertification purposes a slightly revised definition of ``temporary'' employment.Except in unusual situations, temporary employment will be employment forless than twelve (12) months. It is the employer's need, and not the natureof the job, which determines whether a position is, in fact, temporary.The Regional Administrator (RA) must make a threshold determination asto whether the position is temporary as defined in the regulations. Inconsidering whether the job is temporary, the RA will evaluate the employer'sneed for the worker. The unavailability of U.S. workers is not materialto the RA's determination of whether the position is temporary. In some circumstances, a temporary labor certification may be issued fora position which is permanent in nature so long as the employer's needfor a worker in the position is temporary. For example, under the regulations,H-2A labor certification may be appropriate for a Ranch Manager to replacethe employer's permanent manager who is incapacitated due to illness fora specified duration. Although a Ranch Manager is normally considered apermanent job, the employer's need for a replacement worker is temporary.c. <T3>Employer's Status. </T3>Under the regulations, H-2A applications maybe filed by sole employers or by joint employers, provided the definitionalrequirements of 20 CFR 655.100 are met. An association may file as a soleemployer, as a joint employer with its member employers, or as an agentfor its member employers.All parties must sign the application (or authorize an agent to do so),and a letter signed by each member employer authorizing the associationto act on its behalf must accompany the application. The regulations do not preclude a farm labor contractor registered in accordancewith MSPA from filing as the employer on an H-2A application. Instructionsfor handling these applications appear in Chapter II of the handbook. d. <T3>Agents. </T3>An agent may file an H-2A application on behalf of anemployer and sign on behalf of the employer. In such cases, the applicationmust include a signed statement from the employer which authorizes theagent to act on the employer's behalf. The statement must also describein detail the duties which the agent will perform on the employer's behalf.e. <T3>Return of Applications. </T3>Applications filed for positions whichare not ``temporary or seasonal'' or are not in ``agricultural labor orservices'' as defined in the regulations cannot be processed under theH-2A provisions. These applications should be returned to the employerwith a letter from the RA indicating that the application cannot be acceptedfor consideration under the H-2A regulations. The letter will briefly describethe reasons why the application is not appropriate for H-2A processingand must contain all the relevant information (including the statementof appeal rights) described in Section 655.106 (c) and (d) of the H-2Aregulations. The RA will also notify the local office of the action taken.In the event applications of this nature might be eligible for considerationunder the H-2B or permanent labor certification provisions, Regional Officesshould advise employers to this effect in their notices. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Where and How to Apply </ITAG>a. <T3>Filing with Regional Office; Simultaneous Copy to Local Office of theState Employment Service Agency (SESA) \1\</T3><NOTE/>. An employer who desires to use nonimmigrant foreign workersin temporary or seasonal agricultural employment must file a temporarylabor certification application, including a job offer for U.S. workers,with the RA having jurisdiction over the State of intended employment andwith a simultaneous copy submitted to the local SESA office serving thearea of intended employment. Submittal of an application to a SESA doesnot constitute ``filing an application'' for H-2A purposes. Applicationsinvolving multi-State employment within one Region may be processed accordingto this procedure, but multi-State employment which encompasses more thanone Regional Office area of jurisdiction will require the establishmentof special procedures as prescribed by 20 CFR 655.93. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Some SESAs have centralized their administration of thelabor certification process. When this has been done, some of the specificresponsibilities and procedures set forth for local offices could varyslightly from those described in this handbook. In these instances, localoffice staff should be guided by separate State/Central office implementinginstructions, which must be approved by the Regional Office. Employers seeking H-2A certification must file an original of the applicationcontaining an original signature with the appropriate RA. A duplicate ofthe application must be submitted simultaneously with the local SESA office.An original signature is not required on the duplicate submitted with thelocal office. b. <T3>Mail or Personal Delivery. </T3>The regulations require that applicationsbe filed with the RA no less than sixty (60) days prior to the employer'sfirst estimated date of need. The filing date is the date that the applicationis received in the Regional Office. Employers may choose the means by which the application is delivered. However,employers should be urged to select a method of delivery which will ensurereceipt of the application by the Regional Office by the required date.The means of delivery should also provide the employer with a record ofthe filing date of the application. c. <T3>Separate Submittal for Each Job/Occupation and Date of Need. </T3>Morethan one alien may be requested on a H-2A application if the aliens areto perform the same type of services in the same occupation in the samearea of employment. However, separate applications must be submitted foreach distinct occupation for which labor certification is sought. A separateapplication is also required for each distinct date of need in the sameoccupation and activity, unless a master application is involved or theRegional Office believes the dates are so close together that separateapplications would place an unreasonable burden on the employer. If harvest workers are requested on an order, but the local office knows,or has reason to believe from prior experience, that the employer is alsoseeking to have those same workers perform duties in other occupations,such as cooks and cook helpers, the local office must advise the employerthat separate H-2A applications for each occupational classification arerequired. The adverse effect standards and U.S. worker availability criteriawill apply to those ``support personnel'' in accordance with the H-2A regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. What to Submit </ITAG>a. <T3>Application Forms. </T3>The regulation at 20 CFR 655.101(b) providegeneral instructions applicable to the filing of H-2A applications. Employersshould continue to use Forms ETA 750 (Application for Alien EmploymentCertification) and ETA 790 (Agricultural and Food Processing ClearanceOrder) until a new application form for H-2A purposes is issued by DOL.In the meantime, employers should delete the assurances contained in PartA of Form ETA 750. These assurances are inapplicable to the H-2A certificationprocess. The application includes: andbullet; Form ETA 750, Part A, Offer of Employment, completed and signedby the employer (or agent) describing the job for which H-2A labor certificationis being sought, including the number of workers needed and the specificdate the workers are needed. andbullet; Form ETA 790, Agricultural and Food Processing Clearance Order,completed and signed by the employer (or agent) describing the job forwhich recruitment for U.S. workers will be conducted. The form, when submittedby the employer, is actually the employer's job offer, and does not constitutea clearance order at this point in the process. The clearance order isprepared and submitted to the Regional Office for approval by the SESA,as discussed in Section C of Chapter I of this handbook. andbullet; A signed statement that the employer agrees to abide by the assurancesrequired by the regulations at 20 CFR 655.103. This statement may be attachedas an addendum to the application or included on Form ETA 790. andbullet; A statement describing the employer's positive recruitment plan.The plan may be attached as an addendum to the application or includedat Item 21 of Form ETA 750, Part A. andbullet; If the application is filed by an agent on behalf of the employer,the signed authorization statement as described in the regulations at 20CFR 655.101(a)(2). andbullet; If the employer's housing does not yet meet applicable standards,a request for conditional access into the intrastate or interstate clearancesystem as described in the regulations at 20 CFR 654.403(a). andbullet; If the application is filed by an association, a statement identifyingwhether the association is a sole employer, joint employer, or agent forits employer members. Documentation to verify the status of the associationis required, as is a list of the names and addresses of each member whowill employ H-2A workers. Employers' agents and joint employer associations may submit ``master''applications covering virtually identical job opportunities available witha number of employers. Identical job components would normally includesuch items as description of work to be performed, hours of work, pay,and benefits. Job components which normally differ would include such itemsas employer's name, address and phone number, number of workers needed,and description of housing. Each job component which differs for each employermust be clearly identified as such in the ``master'' application package.Although ``master'' applications may be submitted and accepted by the RAunder these circumstances, certifications must still be issued to individualemployers, and such employers must be billed individually. b. <T3>Representations of Agents. </T3>Since they are fully responsible forthe accuracy of their agent's representations, employers should be cautionednot to sign blank application forms. c. <T3>Mandatory Information. </T3>Certain information must be provided inorder for the Department of Labor to make its certification determinationon the acceptability of the application. All items on Forms ETA 750 andETA 790 requesting identifying information about the employer, such asthe employer's name, address, and telephone number, must be completed.Further, local offices and RAs should caution employers that an incompleteapplication could result in delays in processing the employer's requestfor H-2A workers. The employer's application cannot be processed unless the following itemsare completed: andbullet; Form ETA 750, Part A, Items 4-13, 14, 15, 18(a), 18(b), 21, and24; and andbullet; Form ETA 790, Items 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 20.These items provide information regarding the job specifications and durationof employment and are essential to the labor certification determinationprocess, including a determination on whether the application can be ``acceptedfor consideration'', as defined at 20 CFR 655.100(b). <ITAG tagnum="81">4. When to Apply </ITAG>a. <T3>Normal Time Frames for Applying and Processing. </T3>The time framesfor the application and processing of H-2A certification requests are discussedin the regulations at 20 CFR 655.101. In general, H-2A applications mustbe filed with the RA and received in the Regional Office a minimum of sixty(60) calendar days prior to the employer's date of need for workers, andthe RA must make the certification determination no later than twenty calendar(20) days before the date of need, except when special circumstances apply.The RA must notify employers of deficiencies within seven (7) calendardays (including holidays and weekends) of the filing date of the application.<T3>This is a statutory requirement. </T3>The employer will be providedwith five (5) calendar days from the date of the RA's notice to submitcorrections and/or amendments. Corrections or amendments submitted andreceived by the Regional Office beyond five (5) calendar days will resultin a day-for-day postponement of the RA's certification determination.If the fifth-day deadline established by the RA for the employer to submitmodifications falls on a weekend or on a holiday when the office wouldnormally not be open for business, the date for submittal of modificationsshould coincide with the next normal business day. The sixty-day period will allow time for the RA to review the employer'sapplication, obtain amendments to correct deficiencies, if necessary, andpermit time for U.S. worker recruitment prior to the RA's certificationdetermination. The regulations do not specify a minimum recruitment periodprior to the issuance of labor certification. Therefore, RAs, local offices,and employers are urged to consult with each other prior to the sixty-dayfiling date in order to secure an acceptable application as early as possible.If delays in submitting an acceptable application are directly caused bythe State Employment Service Agency (SESA) or the Regional Office, theemployer will not be required to extend the recruitment period beyond thedate on which the RA must make a certification determination. If the RAhas reason to believe that a State agency is not adhering to EmploymentService (ES) regulations, the remedial action procedures at 20 CFR Part658, Subpart H, will be applied. Further, if the RA fails to notify the employer that the application isdeficient and must be amended within the seven (7) calendar days allowedafter filing, such delays will not count against the employer's entitlementto a determination twenty (20) days before the date of need, provided thatthe employer submits the required modifications no later than the five(5) calendar days prescribed in the regulations. b. <T3>Earlier Applications; Working with SESAs Encouraged. </T3>The timeframes of the regulations must be strictly observed in order to allow adequatetime for the recruitment of U.S. workers. To avoid delays in issuing temporarylabor certification, employers should be encouraged to consult with localoffice staff before submitting an application and to file applicationsearly. SESAs also should be active in maintaining cooperative relationshipswith known H-2A employers during the off season in order to keep employersinformed of new and emerging program developments and requirements. Theperiod preceding the 60-day filing deadline should be used to provide technicalassistance to employers in the preparation of their applications and indeveloping clearance orders which can be processed expeditiously once theformal filing and recruitment process begins. In addition, local officesmust advise the RA of circumstances that may impact agricultural activities,such as an anticipated early harvest because of favorable weather conditions.If an application is submitted earlier than the minimum 60-day period prescribedin the regulations, Regional Offices should process such applications accordingto the time frames specified for applications filed on the 60th day beforedate of need; e.g., review and return for amendment an unacceptable applicationwithin 7 calendar days and offer the employer 5 calendar days in whichto resubmit the application. However, in no case should certification determinationsbe made earlier than 20 days before the date of need even though an acceptableapplication is filed more than 60 days before the date of need, and anemployer's certification determination 20 days before the date of needshould not be postponed because of an employer's failure to resubmit atimely modification, unless the resubmittal is not filed until later than48 days before the date of need. c. <T3>Emergency Situations. </T3>The regulations give the RA special authorityto waive the sixty-day filing requirement in emergency situations. In orderto qualify for a waiver, the employer: andbullet; Must not have used temporary alien H-2 or H-2A workers in theprior year's agricultural season (see also Chapter I, A, 4, d); or andbullet; Must demonstrate that good and substantial cause exists to warrantthe special waiver by the RA. Good and substantial cause may include unforeseenchanges in market conditions or unexpected unavailability of previouslyidentified domestic workers whom the employer had planned to use in temporaryor seasonal jobs. The regulations do not preclude an employer who did useH-2A (or H-2) workers the past year from being eligible for emergency certificationconsideration. In such instances, the local office should notify the RA of the criticalcircumstances and help the employer expedite the certification process.To grant a waiver, the RA should have information on what effort the employerhas expended in conducting current or recent local recruitment. This couldinclude newspaper, radio, and television advertising within the State andother potential areas of supply. The RA should be able to conclude thatoutreach or other reliable means of recruitment have failed to produceenough workers, or that workers who have been recruited are suddenly nolonger available, and that further recruitment efforts will not produceenough workers in time to fill the employer's needs. The employer must present a justification for emergency treatment alongwith the application. This justification should include the employer'sexplanation of recruitment efforts made (such as contacts with prospectiveworkers or crew leaders), and a description of other circumstances impactingthe employer's situation, such as special efforts made to assist formerworkers in obtaining Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) status or a descriptionof unfulfilled expectations for Special Agricultural Worker (SAW) workersto be available. The RA may consult the appropriate county extension agent for relevantinformation and advice on such matters as market conditions and may requestthat the SESA provide labor market information or obtain such informationand forward it to the Regional Office. The employer, on his/her own, mayalso submit such supporting evidence from the county agent or any otherrepresantative of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA representativesalso may submit information to the RA on their own initiative. The regulations further require that the RA have adequate opportunity todetermine U.S. worker availability on an expedited basis before makingan emergency labor certification determination. This could be accomplishedby a Regional Office in a labor demand area making inquiries of RegionalOffices in labor supply areas as to worker availability. If an emergencyrequest appears to be justified, RA's should not unduly delay the processingof such requests by requiring extensive SESA recruitment through the clearancesystem, and should attempt to complete the processing in one or two weeks.d. <T3>First-Time Users. </T3>Special provisions of the regulations applyto employers who apply for the first time for H-2A labor certificationduring the two-year period commencing on June 1, 1987, and ending on May31, 1989. Employers who have applied previously under the H-2 program arenot eligible for this special consideration. The filing and recruitmentprovisions applicable to other H-2A users have been relaxed to assist first-timeapplicants who need H-2A workers but lack familiarity with the regulatorysystem. Local offices are encouraged to assist these employers by providingthe guidance needed to fulfill the requirements of the application process.First-time H-2A employers are entitled to a labor certification determinationno later than ten (10) days before the date of need provided that the employerhas submitted an acceptable application and job offer which has been ``acceptedfor consideration'' according to the regulations at 20 CFR 655.100(b) nolater than thirty (30) calendar days before the date of need. In processingsuch applications, the RA must have a reasonable opportunity to test thelabor market prior to a labor certification determination. This provision in the regulations is designed primarily for the noviceemployer who does not have the benefit of association membership or adviceand assistance from people or entities knowledgeable in the labor certificationprocess. While the RA may waive the filing minimum which applies to otheremployers, the RA must also determine that the employer has made a <T3>good faith </T3>effort to otherwise comply with the H-2A regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Amendments to Applications </ITAG>a. <T3>Changes in the Number of Workers Requested. </T3>Subject to the limitationsdescribed in the regulations and prior to the RA's certification determination,employers may amend their H-2A applications to increase the number of workersrequested without additional recruitment. Employers must submit such requestsin writing to the RA with a copy to the local office. Employers requesting an increase which exceeds the twenty percent (or fiftypercent for employers of less than ten workers) limitation described inthe regulations must also explain in their request to the RA why the needfor additional workers was unforeseen and indicate, if applicable, if thecrop or commodity would be harmed if certification were delayed by theimposition of further recruitment. Regional staff should verify the employer'sassertions concerning the crop or commodity status with the local officeor the appropriate county extension agent. If an employer requests an amendment which reduces the original numberof workers, and if U.S. workers recruited against the employer's originallabor needs are either in transit to or have arrived at the job site, theRA shall consider the reason for the request and any detriment which mightoccur to U.S. workers if the change is approved. The employer is required to comply with the requirements for guaranteeingthe first week of wages under 20 CFR 653.501, and should be reminded ofthis requirement under these circumstances.b. <T3>Change in Date of Need. </T3>Employers may change the date of needstated in a job order by sending a written request to the RA, with a copyto the local office. The date of need cannot be changed without the RA'swritten approval. In considering whether to approve a change in the date of need, the RAshall consider the reasons for the request and any detriment which mightoccur to U.S. workers who relied upon the original job order. No change in the date of need is effective until approved by the RA. Ifa request for a change is made after U.S. workers have departed for theemployer's place of employment, the RA may approve the change only uponreceiving the employer's written assurance that all such U.S. workers willbe provided free housing and subsistence until work becomes available.The employer must provide written information to support a finding thata change in the date of need is necessary. No telephone calls will be accepted.The RA will respond promptly to the employer and will send copies of thedetermination to the SESA, which, in turn, will immediately notify allappropriate supply states by telephone followed up with written confirmationon ETA 795. An RA's denial of a request is not subject to further agencyreview. c. <T3>Minor Amendments. </T3>Prior to the certification determination andwith the RA's approval, employers may make minor modifications to theirapplications. Minor modifications consist of those changes which will notsignificantly affect the RA's certification determination, such as a changein the employer's street address, directions to the work site, referralinstructions, meal charges, location of housing units, insurance carrier,or estimated amount of time to be spent in a particular crop activity whenseveral activities are involved. ``Minor'' modifications do not include modifications such as a change inthe number of workers requested or a change in the date of need. Requestsfor minor changes must be made in writing addressed to the RA, with a copyto the local office. After RA approval in writing, the local office shouldprepare Form ETA 795 for distribution into the local, intra-, and interstateclearance systems. An RA's denial of a request of this nature is not subjectto further agency review. d. <T3>Modifications after Certification_Terms and Conditions. </T3>(See alsoChapter I, Section F, 1) Employers may request modification of the termsand conditions of a certified job offer through written application tothe RA. However, all post-certification modifications must be approvedby the RA. An employer's assertion of workers' approval of requested changeshas no relevance to the RA's decision to approve or disapprove a modification,and the RA's notice of disapproval is not appealable within DOL. e. <T3>Modifications after Certification_Time Extension. </T3>Employers mayrequest that the RA extend the period of labor certification. Applicationsto the RA may be made after fifty percent of the work contract period haselapsed. An employer who seeks a one-time total extension of two weeks or less mustapply directly to the INS. DOL cannot grant an extension in cases whereINS has already approved an extension request. Requests for extensions in excess of two weeks must be made in writingsupported by documentation showing that the need for the extension wasunforeseeable. Justifiable reasons to support a request for an extensionmight include such factors as weather conditions, unforeseen changes inmarket conditions or other factors beyond the employer's control. The RAmay consider all available information, including local newspaper reports,in deciding whether to approve or deny the request. The RA may verify the factors cited by the employer with the local officeor the county extension agent, as appropriate. The RA may also ask thelocal office to consult with the county agent to obtain the required verification.Extensions which, if granted, would extend the entire work period for twelve(12) months or more would run contrary to the temporary employment provisionsof the regulations. Such extensions are, therefore, prohibited except inextraordinary situations. A determination as to what constitutes extraordinarycircumstances will be made on a case-by-case basis. RAs should consultwith the National Office when such circumstances occur. There are no provisions for an employer to appeal within DOL a denial ofa request for an extension. Nor are there appeal provisions for denialsof requests for modifications to an application before certification orto the conditions of certification after certification has been granted.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Special Procedures for Special Circumstances </ITAG>The Director, U.S. Employment Service, has the authority under the regulationsto establish special procedures for processing and otherwise handling H-2Aapplications when employers can demonstrate that there is a justifiableneed for such procedures. The Director also has the authority to establishspecial bi-weekly, weekly, or monthly adverse effect wage rates (AEWRs)for occupations characterized by other than a reasonably regular workdayor workweek, such as range production of sheep or other livestock, whereworkers are alone in remote areas and are on call on a twenty-four hourbasis, seven days a week.Special procedures for sheepherder applications and for applications fromcustom combine operators have been in place for several years, and willcontinue to apply, subject to periodic updating and other adjustments asbecome necessary. Regional Offices and SESAs involved in handling thosetypes of certification applications should continue to follow the procedureswhich have been established by the National Office. See FM No. 108-82 forsheepherder guidelines; procedures for custom combiners are transmittedby memorandum to Regions VI, VII, and VIII each year. Employers who believe they have situations which call for special considerationmay request such consideration by writing directly to: Director, U.S. EmploymentService, Room N-4456, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210,with a copy to the appropriate RA. Employers should be advised to specifyin their letters precisely in what manner their particular employment situationdiffers from what normally occurs in agriculture, and precisely what adjustmentto normal H-2A application processing procedures should be considered.There are no appeal rights within DOL of the Director's denial of a requestfor special procedures to be established. B. Contents of Job Offers and Assurances <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Job Offers </ITAG>The application of an employer for temporary alien agricultural labor certificationmust include a job offer. The job offer must include the terms and conditionsof employment which will be used in the recruitment of both U.S. and alienworkers. As a minimum, the job offer must comply with minimum requirementsestablished in the general agricultural clearance order regulations at20 CFR Part 653, Subpart F, and must include certain benefits, wages, andworking conditions which are needed in order to assure no adverse effecton U.S. workers similarly employed. The job offer or the Form ETA 790 mustalso include an agreement to abide by the assurances specified in the regulationsat 20 CFR 655.103. A short statement to this effect is sufficient. Certain components of the job offer also must conform to what is ``prevailing'',``normal'' or ``common'' practice in the area for the occupation. (SeeChapter II, Section C.) a. <T3>Equivalent Treatment of U.S. and Alien Workers. </T3>A basic premiseof any labor certification determination is that the employer must offerU.S. workers at least the same opportunities, wages, benefits, and workingconditions as those which the employer offers or intends to offer to non-immigrantforeign workers. If such terms and conditions of employment for the alienshave been prearranged through a worker agreement or contract, the employershould be required to furnish a copy of such contract with the applicationso that the RA may make a threshold determination on the equivalent benefitcriteria. (Furnishing a copy of such contract, however, does not constitute DOL approvalof the terms and conditions in the contract, which are subject to furtherreview, and a copy of the alien worker contract should not accompany ajob order into clearance.) At the same time, the employer may not require more of U.S. workers thanis being required of the alien workers. For example, if the employer allowsalien workers a certain period of breaking in or training time to achievea required production standard, U.S. workers must be offered at least thesame opportunity for reaching the standard without being discouraged. b. <T3>Housing. </T3>Housing must be available for all non-commuting workerswithout charge to the workers. ``Non-commuting'' refers to workers whoare not reasonably able to return to their residence within the same day.The job offer should provide a written description of the housing to beprovided, including the location, type (dormitory, 5-room frame house,etc.), and number of workers and, where appropriate, family members whocan be accommodated. The job offer shall clearly state that housing isprovided at no cost to workers. Family housing is to be made available and provided under certain circumstances.This depends upon a determination by the RA on the practices of employersin the area of employment to provide family housing for workers in thesame occupation for which workers are requested. If it is the prevailingpractice, as determined by a survey, then such family housing must be providedto workers with families who request such housing arrangements. (See alsoChapter II, Section C.) Housing arrangements may be basically three types, as provided for in theregulations: andbullet; <T3>Employer Provided Housing. </T3>This is housing which is owned or leasedthrough long-term arrangements by the employer for housing temporary agriculturalworkers. Such housing must comply with the full set of U.S. Departmentof Labor (DOL) standards (Occupational Safety and Health Administration[OSHA] or Employment and Training Administration [ETA], as applicable).(Also see Chapter II, Section D of handbook.)If the housing is not in full compliance with such standards at the timeof application, the employer must request in writing conditional accessto the clearance system with assurance that such housing will be in fullcompliance at least thirty (30) calendar days before it is to be occupied.This time frame may be waived for employers whose applications are acceptedunder emergency or first-time user provisions. However, the requirementsto provide adequate housing which meets applicable standards cannot bewaived, and certification under the emergency and first-time user provisionscannot be granted for an employer who is providing non-rental housing unlessthat employer's housing has been inspected and has been found to meet standards.andbullet; <T3>Arrangements for Other Housing. </T3>Employers may make other arrangementsfor housing, such as rental or public accommodations, which meet standardsfor such housing. If there are no local or State standards, then such housingmust meet the OSHA standards established in the regulations at 29 CFR 1910.142.The employer must provide documentation that such housing is in compliancewith local or State standards, if this is the case. This may be in theform of a certificate from the local or State Department of Health officeor a statement from the manager or owner of the housing. Local officesshould check to be sure that such standards do, in fact, exist. If rentalhousing is obtained, the employer shall make all the arrangements and paythe rental fee directly to the owner or operator of the housing. Workersshall not be held responsible in any way for paying the rental cost ofthe accommodation. Normally, rental housing would consist of a commercial, motel-type accommodationfor transients. However, there is nothing to preclude an employer who doesnot actually own housing on his/her property from renting non-commercialhousing from other individuals or entities for the purpose of housing temporaryagricultural workers. When this occurs, the local or state standard principlefor acceptability of the housing applies. However, SESA's and RegionalOffices should examine such situations carefully to ensure that employersin an area are not attempting to circumvent DOL's housing standards byentering into reciprocal rental arrangements as a means to avoid pre-occupancyhousing inspections. This is not permissible. It is not permissible for workers to be required to make deposits for bedding,other items furnished in the accommodations, or for possible damage toaccommodations. If workers are subsequently found to have been responsiblefor damage, the employers may require reimbursement for such damages asprescribed in the regulations. Such reimbursements, however, may not resultin a worker's wages going below the Federal minimum wage, unless specificallyauthorized by FLSA regulations. andbullet; <T3>Range Housing. </T3>Housing for workers primarily engaged in the rangeproduction of livestock must meet applicable standards per guidelines issuedby DOL. Separate guidelines for sheepherder range housing are presentedin FM No. 108-82, July 8, 1982. Other guidelines may be developed as appropriate.c. <T3>Workers' Compensation. </T3>The job offer shall include a statementthat workers' compensation will be provided at no cost to all workers inthe occupation for which workers are being sought. The coverage and benefitsprovided will be at least equal to that provided under the State workers'compensation law for comparable employment. If coverage is in effect atthe time of application, the employer will set forth in the applicationthe insurance carrier and the policy number, or, if appropriate, proofof State law coverage. If coverage is not in effect, the employer is requiredto provide proof of coverage before a labor certification can be granted.d. <T3>Employer Provided Items. </T3>The job offer shall describe all equipmentwhich will be used by workers in performing the job opportunity. Work equipmentmay be picking bags, gloves, clippers, knives, files, etc. All such equipmentshall be provided by the employer without charge (e.g., any deposit) <T3>except </T3>where the employer asserts that it is the common practicein the crop activity, the geographic area, and occupation for workers toprovide such necessary tools and equipment. This would apply regardlessof whether the employer subsequently reimbursed workers for such cost.In any event, the employer must clearly document that it is the commonpractice and obtain written approval in advance from the RA before thisexception can be granted. Further, the costs incurred by the worker inproviding his/her own tools, supplies and equipment may not bring the worker'swages below the FLSA minimum for the workweek in which the cost is incurred.e. <T3>Meals. </T3>The job offer shall specifically describe the arrangementsmade for feeding workers. If the employer has a centralized cooking andfeeding facility, the employer must provide each worker with three mealsper day. If the worker is working at the time of scheduled meal time, thejob offer must describe the meal arrangement for feeding the worker; e.g.,sack lunch, meal catered to field, etc.In the absence of centralized facilities, the employer may arrange formeals to be provided to the workers by means of a catering service whichwill deliver meals prepared elsewhere to the employer's facility. If centralized cooking and eating facilities are not available and cateredmeals are not provided, the employer must furnish at no cost to the workersconvenient cooking and eating facilities of sufficient size and capacity(including utensils) which would enable workers to prepare their own meals.The job offer shall clearly describe such facilities and state that thefacilities and necessary utensils are provided at no cost to the workers.Where meals are provided, the job offer shall also state the daily chargefor three meals. Such charge cannot exceed the amount permitted by theregulations at 20 CFR 655.102 or 20 CFR 655.111. f. <T3>Transportation. </T3>andbullet; <T3>To Place of Employment. </T3>The job offer should describe the arrangementsby which the worker will travel to and from the place of employment. Ifit is the prevailing practice of non-H-2A employers in the area and occupationto advance transportation and subsistence costs (or provide such), theemployer shall state in the job offer that transportation and subsistencecost will be advanced. Employers are also required to offer U.S. workersat least the same benefits which are provided H-2A workers; therefore,if transportation will be provided or advanced to H-2A workers, the samemust be offered to U.S. workers. The amount of transportation cost willbe determined to be at least that by the most economical and reasonablesimilar common transportation carrier. If it is not the prevailing practice for non-H-2A employers to advanceor provide transportation and subsistence, the job offer must stipulatethat the worker will be paid the costs incurred by the worker for transportationand subsistence upon completion of fifty percent of the contract period.In either case, the amount of the daily subsistence payment will be atleast the amount the employer could charge the workers for meals under20 CFR 655.102(b)(4) and for the time it would take for a worker to travelby the most economical and reasonable common transportation carrier tothe job site. If an employer is subject to FLSA, the employer may not make deductions(for transportation) from the worker's pay or require the worker to incurcosts that would result in the pay falling below the Federal minimum wage,unless otherwise specifically authorized by FLSA regulations. andbullet; <T3>From Place of Employment. </T3>The job offer should also state thattransportation and subsistence benefits will be provided for workers whocomplete the work contract period. This means that the employer must offerto pay for (or provide) the worker's transportation home, or wherever theworker began the series of jobs culminating at the current place of employment.If the worker has obtained a subsequent job, but the subsequent employerhas not offered to pay for (in advance or by reimbursement) the worker'stransportation from the current place of employment to the other employer'splace of employment, the current employer must offer to pay for (or provide)such transportation expenses. However, where the subsequent employer hasoffered to pay for (or provide), in advance or by reimbursement, the worker'stransportation from the current place of employment to the subsequent employer'splace of employment, the current employer is not required to pay for (orprovide) such transportation.This benefit does not apply to workers who voluntarily quit employmentbefore the end of the contract or who are terminated for cause, providingthe employer notifies the Job Service office of such action. The same deduction or cost incurred limitation described above for incomingtransportation applies to return transportation. andbullet; <T3>Between Living Quarters and Work Site. </T3>The job offer shall clearlystate that the employer will provide transportation from the place wherethe employer has provided housing to the actual work site and return atthe end of the work day. Such transportation will be without cost to theworker, and the means of transportation shall meet all applicable safetystandards. This benefit is not applicable to local workers who are not eligible foremployer-provided housing. g. <T3>Three-fourths Guarantee. </T3>This provision guarantees the workeran opportunity to work for at least three-fourths of the number of hoursin the work days during the period of the contract. The number of hoursin the workday is that stated in the job offer. The period of the contractis from the first work day after arrival of the worker at the place ofemployment until the expiration date of the work contract. If the U.S.or H-2A worker is not offered the opportunity to work for three-fourthsof such hours during this period, then the employer must supplement thepay of such worker as though the worker had actually worked such guaranteedemployment. If a worker is paid on a piece rate or other similar incentive system,the worker's average hourly piece rate earnings (if higher than the AEWR)will be used in determining the amount due under this guarantee. The three-fourths guarantee will not apply to any H-2A worker who may bedisplaced by a U.S. worker under the fifty-percent rule. h. <T3>Record. </T3>The job offer shall state that the employer will keepand maintain adequate and accurate payrolls and supporting records in accordancewith the provisions of 20 CFR 655.102(b)(7). It is not necessary to describein detail on the job offer the type of records maintained. Employers alsomay be required to maintain additional records which may be required byFLSA or MSPA. i. <T3>Hours and Earnings Statement. </T3>The job offer should state thatan hours and earnings statement will be given to each worker when the workeris paid. The statement must be in writing and must be given on a basisno less frequently than on pay day. The earnings records to be providedeach worker may be a combination of daily records and a summary statementof earnings and deductions given at the time of actual payment. For example,a worker may be given a statement each day which would show: andbullet; Name and payroll identification number; andbullet; Work starting and ending time; andbullet; Hours worked, including hours offered and actually worked (Note:The reason for not working hours offered should be explained either specificallyor by a readily identifiable code.); andbullet; Hourly rate or piece rate; andbullet; If piece rate, the number of units produced; and andbullet; Total earnings. At the time the worker is actually paid, a check stub or statement maybe given which would show: andbullet; Gross wages; andbullet; Itemization of all deductions for meals, Social Security, cashadvances, etc. (Note: All deductions not required by law which may be madefrom worker's earnings must be specifically stated in the job offer.);and andbullet; Net payment. j. <T3>Rates of Pay. </T3>The job offer should clearly state the rate of payeither by the hour and/or by a piece rate per identifiable unit of production.If the worker is to be paid by the hour, the rate stated must be at leastthe highest of the following wage rates: andbullet; The adverse effect wage rate for the State; andbullet; The prevailing hourly wage rate for the occupation in the geographicarea of employment as established by a SESA prevailing wage survey whichis verified by the National Office; orandbullet; The legal federal or State minimum wage rate. To cover situations in which the adverse effect wage rate might changeduring the contract period (usually March or April), the job offer shouldcontain a statement that the employer will pay at least the adverse effectwage rate in effect at the time work is performed. An employer may statein the job offer/order that in the event DOL promulgates a new AEWR duringthe recruitment or work contract period which is lower than the currentAEWR at the time of application, this lower AEWR will become the guaranteedminimum (unless there is a prevailing hourly rate which is higher thanthe AEWR). Absent this provision in the job order, the employer will notbe permitted to pay a lower AEWR should one be published during the contractperiod. If the worker is to be paid on a piece rate basis (price per identifiableand measurable unit of production), the job offer must state the piecerate. The unit of production must be clearly described; e.g., a field boxof oranges (1\1/2\ bushels), a bushel of potatoes, an Eastern apple box(1\1/2\ metric bushels), a flat of strawberries (twelve quarts), etc. The piece rate wage offer must be at least what is prevailing for the occupationand crop activity in the area of employment. For example, if a State agencysurvey determined that the prevailing wage rate was $.50 for picking 1\1/2\bushels of oranges during the past season, the employer must offer at leastthis rate of pay on the job offer. The job offer should also state that if a worker is paid on a piece ratebasis and piece rate does not result at the end of the pay period in averagehourly piece rate earnings at least equal to the amount the worker wouldhave earned had the worker been paid at the <T3>appropriate hourly rate, </T3>the worker's pay shall be supplementedat that time so that the workers earnings are at least as much as the workerwould have earned during the pay period if the worker has been paid atthe appropriate hourly wage rate for each hour worked. For example, anemployee works forty-two hours during a one-week pay period. The workerpicked three hundred and fifty field boxes of oranges @ $.50 per box, withactual earnings of $175.00, or $4.16 per hour. The State AEWR is $5.00per hour. Had he/she worked by the hour, the worker's earnings would be42andmultiply;$5.00=$210.00. Thus, the employee's pay must be supplementedby $35.00 at the end of this pay period. In the above example, the AEWR is the appropriate hourly wage rate becauseno prevailing hourly wage rate has been determined by the SESA for theoccupation and the area which is higher than the published AEWR. The ``appropriate''hourly wage rate in most cases will be the published AEWR. However, ifa SESA survey, which is verified by the National Office, results in a prevailinghourly wage rate for the occupation and the area which is higher than thepublished AEWR, this hourly rate would be the ``appropriate'' rate. Inthe event both the published AEWR and the verified prevailing hourly rateare lower than the FLSA minimum, the FLSA minimum will be the standardthat must be used. The job offer should also specify the standards of production for job retentionof a worker. If an employer filed an H-2 application in 1977, the productivitystandard on the current job offer can be no more than required by the employerin 1977 (or first year in the H-2 or H-2A program after 1977), unless theRA has approved a higher level subsequent to 1977. A new employer who filesan application for labor certification for the first time after 1977 willbe bound by productivity standards (existing at the time of application)normally required by other employers for the same crop activity in thesame geographic area. The RA may approve a higher minimum upon receiving substantive documentationfrom an employer in writing justifying a higher standard. Such documentationshould show the increase is justified by technological, horticultural,or other labor saving means.k. <T3>Frequency of Pay. </T3>The job offer shall clearly state the lengthof the pay period, and the ending day of the week of the payroll periodand date (day of week following payroll ending) on which workers will bepaid. An example of such an entry would be: ``Workers will be paid eachFriday for the weekly payroll period ending on the preceding Tuesday.''The employer must pay workers at least as frequently as what is prevailingfor employers of similarly employed workers in the area of intended employment,but no less than twice monthly. 1. <T3>Contract Impossibility. </T3>The provision of the regulations at 20CFR 655.102(b)(12) allows the employer to terminate the work contract ofany worker(s) whose services are no longer required for reasons beyondthe control of the employer. In the event of such termination, the employerwill be bound by the three-fourths guarantee from the first work day afterarrival to the date of termination. If the employer is unable to work out a transfer of the worker to othercomparable employment, the employer will be required to offer to returnthe worker at the employer's expense to the place from which the workercame to work for the employer in accordance with the regulations at 20CFR 655.102(b)(5)(ii). If the worker who is terminated under this provision has not been reimbursedfor transportation to the job site in accordance with 20 CFR 655.102(b)(5)(i),the worker will be reimbursed for any transportation and subsistence due.If transportation was advanced and subsequently deductions were made fromthe worker's pay to cover costs, these deductions must be reimbursed tothe worker and, if necessary, supplemented up to the inbound transportationlevel. m. <T3>Deductions. </T3>The job offer shall specify all deductions not requiredby law. An employer subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) willnot make deductions from pay which would bring the wage below the federalminimum for the work week unless authorized by the FLSA regulations. n. <T3>Copy of Work Contract. </T3>If an employer develops a written contractbetween the employer and the worker, the contract must include the termsand conditions of employment specified in the regulations. A copy of suchcontract will be provided to the worker no later than the day on whichthe worker begins employment. In order to prevent any possible misunderstandingconcerning the agreed upon contract, a sample work contract might be postedin a conspicuous location at the work site or housing facilities for workers.In the absence of a specific separate written work contract incorporatingthe terms and conditions of the job order, the terms and conditions ofthe job order (which must include the requirements in the regulations)and application shall be the work contract, and a copy of the job ordermust be provided to the worker. If a written work contract will be used, the job offer should so state,and a copy should be attached to the job offer if possible. (Furnishinga copy of such contract, however, does not constitute DOL approval of theterms and conditions of the contract which are subject to further DOL review.)If there is no written contract, the job offer may include a statementsuch as: ``In the absence of a written contract, the terms and conditionsof the clearance job order and application are to be the work contractbetween the employer and the worker so employed.'' o. <T3>Occupational Qualifications. </T3>The Immigration and Nationality Act(INA), as amended by the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986,specifically directs that the qualifications for a job offer be appropriateand not be more than the normally accepted qualifications required by non-H-2Aemployers in ``the same or comparable crops''. The labor certificationdetermination is based upon a fair test of the labor market for U.S. workerswho are <T3>able, willing, qualified </T3>and <T3>eligible </T3>to perform the job for which nonimmigrant workers arerequested.RAs receiving H-2A applications (and local offices receiving copies) fromagricultural employers should carefully examine any unusual qualificationsimposed by the employer in the job offer. An expedited survey should bemade of non-H-2A employers and information obtained as to the minimal qualificationsnecessary to perform the occupation for which certification is being sought.In addition to obtaining information from the local office, the RA shouldexamine sources of occupational information such as the <T3>Dictionary of Occupational Titles. </T3>Also, the RA may consult withthe State extension service and appropriate representatives of the U.S.Department of Agriculture (USDA) in determining the appropriateness ofqualifications. If the RA questions the appropriateness of a required qualification,the burden for proving that the qualification requirement is, in fact,necessary, rests with the employer. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Assurances </ITAG>It will not be necessary for the job offer to include a recitation of theassurances called for in this section (or those in 653.501); nor is a separatesigned assurances statement necessary. However, the employer must providea statement in the job order similar to the following: ``The employer agreesto abide by the assurances specified in the conditions of 20 CFR Part 655,Subpart B, including the regulations at 20 CFR 655.103.'' Although thisgeneral statement is acceptable for the job offer, Regional Office andSESA staff should be acquainted with each assurance called for in thissection. A brief summary of each follows. a. <T3>Labor Disputes. </T3>The job opportunity for which an alien workeris being sought must not be vacant because the former occupant is on strikeor is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute. Nonimmigrant workerscannot be sought as a means of replacing workers who are no longer encumberinga position because they are involved in a labor dispute. SESA staff should be alert as to any labor disputes which may involve agriculturalemployers who file, who had previously filed, or who have filed or havepending a temporary agricultural labor certification application or whohave received such a certification. The facts concerning the labor disputeshould be reported to the RA. As a minimum, the following facts shouldbe reported: andbullet; The issue(s) involved in the labor dispute; andbullet; The occupation(s) directly involved, including the total numberof workers involved in the dispute and the total number of workers employedin the occupation(s); and andbullet; The date the labor dispute began. When the RA has information on the existence of a labor dispute which couldimpact directly upon a labor certification determination, the RA must ensurethat an official investigation is conducted. Chapter II, Section E of thishandbook addresses steps that are taken in that type of situation. b. <T3>Employment-Related Laws. </T3>The employer agrees to comply with allapplicable federal, State, and local employment-related laws (includinghealth and safety laws) and regulations during the period for which laborcertification is granted. It is not likely that a situation will arise when compliance with a localor State law or regulation will preclude compliance with a federal lawor regulation, or <T3>vice versa. </T3>Normally, such statutes and regulations are constructedin a fashion which will permit at least minimal compliance with other relevantstatutory and regulatory requirements. For example, some States have regulationslimiting the maximum amount employers may charge workers for meals to anamount which is less then that permitted as maximum by the H-2A regulations.However, the H-2A regulations (20 CFR 655.102(b)(4)) prescribe that themaximum amount shall ``<T3>not be more than * * * </T3>per day * * *'' In the highly unlikely event that SESA's or Regional Offices encountersituations where compliance with all applicable federal, State and localemployment-related laws and regulations appears to be not possible, RegionalOffices should consult with the National Office for advice and assistance.If a State agency has reason to believe that the employer may be in violationof employment-related laws such as OSHA, MSPA or IRCA during a period coveredby a labor certification, the facts should be reported to the RA for appropriatehandling under the provisions of the regulation at 20 CFR 655.110. Suchaction shall not in any way impede prompt handling and resolution of anyworker complaint filed pursuant to the regulations at 20 CFR Part 658,Subpart E. c. <T3>Rejection and Termination of U.S. Workers. </T3>U.S. workers cannotbe rejected for or terminated from employment for other than lawful job-relatedreasons. Lawful job-related reasons include failure to achieve productivitylevels, malingering, or serious misconduct. The employer must report eachsituation when U.S. workers are refused employment or are terminated, forany reason, in writing to the local office. Local offices shall maintaina record of such actions for at least two years.d. <T3>Recruitment of U.S. Workers. </T3>The employer agrees to engage inindependent positive recruitment of U.S. workers until H-2A workers leavefor the employer's eatablishment and to cooperate with the Employment Service(ES) system in recruiting U.S. workers. e. <T3>Fifty Percent Rule. </T3>(See also Chapter I, Section F, 4.) This sectionstates that the employer must continue to provide employment to any qualifiedand eligible U.S. worker who applies until fifty percent of the periodof the work contract has elapsed. This requirement begins on the date thatforeign workers depart for the employer's place of employment, which iswhen the employer's obligation to engage in positive recruitment ceases.The employer is required to notify the local office, in writing, of theexact date on which the H-2A workers depart for the employer's establishment.The employer must keep an active job order on file until the ``fifty percentrule'' has been met. The expiration date of the local and agriculturalclearance order should also be adjusted to reflect the ending date of thefifty percent rule requirement. Of course, if the employer is willing toaccept U.S. workers after this date, the local order (and the clearanceorder, if specifically agreed to) may remain open. Note: This section does not apply to a ``small'' employer who certifiesto the RA in the application that he/she did not use more than five hundred(500) man-days of agricultural labor during any calendar quarter in thepreceding calendar year and is not a member of an association which hasapplied for labor certification on behalf of its members and has not ``associated''with other H-2A employer-applicants under the regulations. f. <T3>Other Positive Recruitment. </T3>(See also Chapter I, Section D andChapter II, Section C.) Upon acceptance of the certification applicationof an agricultural employer, the RA will specify the recruitment effortwhich must be undertaken by the employer. This shall include specific positiverecruitment efforts which are consistent with the efforts expended by non-H-2Aagricultural employers of comparable or smaller size when they recruitdomestic workers in the area of employment. The RA may require the employerto make efforts which are at least at the same level as the efforts whichthe employer has or will make to obtain H-2A workers in another country.The RA also has the authority to require the employer to engage in independentpositive recruitment out of the area when the RA has specific, reliable,and current information that there is a potential supply of U.S. workersavailable elsewhere who, if recruited, would likely be able and willingto fill the job opportunities. Such information would normally be consideredreliable if it were supplied by another Regional Office or a SESA, althoughother sources of information may be used. Positive recruitment is in addition to the circulation of a clearance orderthrough the ES system, and can only be required during the same periodthat a clearance order is being circulated. The obligation to engage insuch positive recruitment efforts will end on the date that H-2A workersdepart for the employer's place of work. The employer must also make an effort to secure U.S. workers through farmlabor contractors (crew leaders) where it is the prevailing practice ofnon-H-2A agricultural employers in the area of employment for the sameoccupation. The level of effort must be at least equal to that made bysuch non-H-2A agricultural employers. Most crew leaders require an override for their services. The H-2A employermust also provide an override which is at least that provided by non-H-2Aemployers, except that employers are not required to offer an overridethat includes the provision of housing by the crew leader, since the employermust provide free housing in compliance with the regulations at 20 CFR655.102(b)(1). Further, where the employer has centralized cooking and eating facilities,the override offer does not have to contain a provision for this serviceto be provided by the crew leader. The positive recruitment requirement is one of the major changes IRCA hasmade to the temporary agricultural labor certification program, and anemployer's failure to conduct positive recruitment specified by the RAmust, by statute, result in denial of certification. However, RegionalOffices must exercise discretion by taking into account historical andrecent recruiting efforts which have been made and must avoid requiringemployers to engage in efforts which would likely prove futile. g. <T3>Retaliation Prohibited. </T3>This section prohibits the employer (eitherdirectly or through another person) from engaging in retaliatory actionagainst any person who has sought redress for perceived inequities underthe provisions of the H-2A program or assists another person in doing so.This would include retaliatory action against a person who takes any ofthe following courses of action: andbullet; Files a complaint; andbullet; Institutes or causes legal proceedings to be instituted;andbullet; Testifies or is scheduled to testify in a legal proceeding; andbullet; Consults with an employee of a legal assistance program or anattorney; andbullet; Complains to the employer or to a farm labor contractor; or andbullet; Otherwise exercises or asserts on behalf of himself/herself orothers any right or protection afforded by law and regulations. h. <T3>Fees. </T3>(See also Chapter I, Section E.) Each employer to whom certificationis granted in whole or in part must pay a fee for that certification. Thefee is not required at the time of application, and fees are not chargedfor certification redeterminations. When the RA or certifying officer makes the certification determination(usually twenty calendar days before the date of need), the certificationnotice will contain a statement indicating that the bill for the fee assessedfor processing the application is attached. The fee must be paid withinthirty days of the certification determination date. Failure to pay the certification fee on a timely basis (within thirty days)could result in a finding by the RA that a substantial violation has occurredpursuant to the regulations at 20 CFR 655.110(a). This finding could resultin a notice to the employer that a labor certification request will notbe granted in the next year for a similar period of time. C. Acceptance or Rejection of Applications <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Time Frames </ITAG>The regulations establish strict time frames within which the RA must notifyemployers of any deficiencies on their applications for H-2A labor certification.Employers face a correspondingly short time period within which they arerequired to respond to the RA or face day-for-day postponement of the laborcertification determination. In order for the RA to notify the employer of deficiencies within sevencalendar days, procedures must be established to assure the expeditiousreview of the application upon receipt by the RA. RAs should not returnapplications for minor errors or deficiencies which have no material effecton the labor certification determination. Acceptance or rejection of aninitial application should be determined by the acceptability of the componentsof the application directly related to worker recruitment and the preventionof adverse effect. If minor revisions to the application are needed, they should be requested,to the extent possible, by telephone. Regional Offices snould bear in mindthat the employer's application submitted under the H-2A procedures isnot required to have been previously reviewed by the SESA for completeness,and should not apply the same level of precision in reviewing the applicationwhich is applied to review of clearance orders submitted by the SESA. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Steps in Handling Applications </ITAG>a. <T3>Regional Office. </T3>Employers must file applications for H-2A laborcertification no less than sixty calendar days prior to their estimateddates of need by a means calculated to assure timely delivery and to providethe employer with a record that the application was received by the RA.The Regional Office must date stamp the application upon receipt, and mayrecord the date in the appropriate block of the Endorsements Section ofForm ETA 750. The application must be reviewed as soon as possible after it has beenfiled. Regional staff may complete the suggested Checklist for ReviewingH-2A Applications which appears in the Appendices for this purpose. Thesuggested Checklist has been developed to include the steps that employersmust take to correct deficiencies and may be used to notify employers ofdeficiencies in a rejection letter. If the Checklist is used as the basisfor a rejection notice, the Regional Office should transmit the accompanyingcover letter appearing in the Appendices.In cases where Regional Offices have a number of applications filed atthe same time, and some applications are acceptable while others are not,the applications which require rejection notices should be processed first,and such notices should be mailed before acceptable applications are processedand employers are sent written notices of acceptance. In view of time constraints,rejection notices may be handwritten. Regional Offices should keep a log of H-2A labor certification activity.The log should record the employer's name, the occupation and number ofworkers requested, the date of need, the expected and actual certificationdates, the date of acceptance, and the actual rejection dates. b. <T3>Local Offices. </T3>Employers must file a duplicate copy of their H-2Aapplication with the local SESA office serving the area of intended employment.Employers should be advised to select a means of delivery which will assurereceipt of the application by the local office no later than sixty calendardays prior to the date of need. The local office should date stamp the application upon receipt, and immediatelyprepare a local job order and an agricultural clearance order. When theclearance order has been prepared, the local office should forward a copyto the State office. The State office should begin to prepare the orderfor intrastate and interstate clearance and take the steps necessary tosecure Regional Office approval of the clearance order so that it can berapidly placed into clearance after the Regional Office accepts the employer'sapplication for consideration and it has been determined that there arenot sufficient local workers available. Recruitment under the local order should begin immediately. The local officeshould review the job offer portion of the employer's application. If deficienciesare noted, the local office must report them to the RA. Notification bytelephone is appropriate for this purpose. Recruitment for intrastate and interstate workers may not begin until theSESA is notified that the application has been accepted and the clearanceorder has been approved by the RA. This notification may be made by telephoneto the State office and later confirmed by the RA in writing with copiesof the acceptance letter to the State and the local office. Due to reducedprocessing times, the State office should distribute the employer's clearanceorder into the intrastate and interstate clearance upon telephonic notificationof the RA's acceptance. Employers may amend their applications to correct deficiencies after rejectionby the RA. Clearance orders which have been prepared by local offices mustalso be amended prior to intrastate and interstate recruitment. Local officesmay use Form ETA 795 (Agricultural and Food Processing Clearance Memorandum)to report any amendments made to the original application. Form ETA 795should be attached to the clearance order prior to intrastate and interstatedistribution. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Acceptance </ITAG>Clearance orders based on an H-2A job opportunity may not be distributedinto the intrastate or interstate clearance system until they are reviewedand approved by the RA in accordance with the agricultural clearance orderregulations at 20 CFR Part 653, Subpart F. Although the regulations set forth no specific time period within whichthe RA must notify the employer that an application is acceptable, RAsshould make every effort to assure that acceptance letters are transmittedin sufficient time for the employer and the ES to conduct an adequate testof the labor market prior to a certification determination. If the application is filed in a timely manner and meets the adverse effectrequirements of the regulations at 20 CFR 655.101-655.103, the RA mustpromptly notify the employer in writing using next-day delivery servicewith copies to the SESA. The RA should also notify the SESA by telephonethat the employer's application has been accepted so that intrastate andinterstate recruitment can commence without delay. The RA acceptance letter must advise the employer of the specific recruitmentobligations outlined in the regulations at 20 CFR 655.105(a). RAs may developtheir own notifications or may use the sample letter contained in the Appendicesof this handbook. In order to ensure a timely assessment of an employer'srecruitment efforts and the results thereof, the RA's notice should requirethe employer to report on these efforts, preferably within three days ofthe certification determination date. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Rejection_Untimely Applications </ITAG>Applications for H-2A certification which are received by the RA less thansixty days before the employer's first date of need must be rejected forlack of timeliness, unless the employer meets the guidelines for firsttime or emergency processing contained in the regulations at 20 CFR 655.101(c)(5)and 20 CFR 655.101(f).The RA's rejection notice must be mailed no later than the seventh calendarday following the RA's receipt of the application using next-day deliveryservice. Employers whose applications have been rejected for lack of timelinessmay follow the appeal or hearing provisions of the regulations or may refilethe application with the RA with a later date of need in order to meetthe sixty day filing requirement of the regulations. The RA's determinationas to whether a refiled application is timely will be based on the dateof the later submission. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Rejection_Adverse Effect </ITAG>Applications which do not meet the adverse effect criteria of the regulationsat 20 CFR 655.101-655.103 must be rejected within seven calendar days offiling. The RA's notification must state that the application cannot beaccepted because the availability of U.S. workers cannot be adequatelytested because the benefits, wages, and/or working conditions do not meetthe adverse effect criteria of the regulations. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Notice of Rejection </ITAG>The RA's notice to the employer that an application is unacceptable mustbe in writing and mailed no later than the seventh calendar day followingthe RA's receipt of the application, with copies to the SESA. RAs mustmail rejection notices in a manner reasonably calculated to assure nextday delivery, using commercial express delivery if appropriate. In some instances, next day delivery may not be possible, and the RA maymake special delivery arrangements with employers. For example, an employermay arrange to receive the notice in person at the Regional Office. Similarly,the RA may arrange for overnight delivery to the local or State officewhere the employer may personally receive the notice. The employer must be specifically advised of the reasons why the applicationhas been rejected, including citations to the applicable regulations. Thenotice must offer the employer an opportunity to submit a modified applicationwithin five calendar days of the date of the RA's notice. RAs should specifythe due date in the notice. In addition, the modifications necessary foran acceptable application must be specifically indicated in the RA's notice.The RA's notice must also advise employers of their right to an expeditedadministrative review or a <T3>de novo </T3>hearing. Sample notices are included in the Appendicesof the handbook. The RA may not penalize an employer for delays which are not attributableto the employer. Therefore, an employer's certification date may not bedelayed if the RA fails to make the required notification of unacceptabilitywithin seven calendar days. The RA's failure to make a timely determinationwill not cause the certification determination to be extended beyond 20calendar days before the need, provided the employer's submittal of requiredmodifications is timely. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Resubmission with Required Modifications </ITAG>Employers must submit requested modifications within five calendar daysfollowing the date of notification or face day-for-day postponement oftheir certification date. The employer's obligation to submit modificationswithin five days is considered to have been met if the required modificationnotice is postmarked by the 5th day, and is operative even if the RA failsto notify the employer of unacceptability in a timely manner. In such instances,however, the RA may not delay the certification determination for any portionof the delay which was not attributable to the employer. Employers must send modifications directly to the RA with a duplicate copyto the local SESA office. Upon receipt of its copy, the SESA should prepareForm ETA 795, (Agricultural and Food Processing Clearance Memorandum) containingthe employer's modifications, attach it to Form ETA 790 which was previouslyprepared by the SESA based on the employer's initial submittal. The Stateagency must extend the modified job order into intrastate and interstateclearance as soon as it receives notice that the modified application hasbeen accepted. RAs may telephone the State office with notification thatthe application has been accepted. The employer's modified application must contain all the modificationsrequired by the RA or it cannot be accepted. Modified applications whichdo not contain all of the changes should be returned to the employer. Theemployer should be informed that the modified application is unacceptablefor consideration because it does not contain the necessary modifications,a certification determination will be further delayed by one day for eachday's delay in receiving the modified application, and that this second(and any subsequent non-acceptance notice) is appealable under the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Appeals </ITAG>Employers seeking expedited administrative review or a <T3>de novo</T3> hearing on the nonacceptance of an application must telegraphsuch requests to the Chief Administrative Law Judge within seven calendardays of the date of the RA's notice. A copy of the appeal or hearing requestmust also be sent to the RA. The request should contain any legal argumentswhich the employer believes will rebut the basis for nonacceptance of theapplication. Upon receipt of notification that a request for expedited administrativereview or a <T3>de novo </T3>hearing has been filed, the RA must immediately preparean indexed certified copy of the case file and transmit it to the ChiefAdministrative Law Judge pursuant to the regulation at 20 CFR 655.112 (a)(1),notwithstanding the timeliness or untimeliness of the request. The RA mustmail the appeal file by any means reasonably calculated to assure nextday receipt by the Office of the Administrative Law Judges. Address the appeal file to: Chief Administrative Law Judge, U.S. Departmentof Labor, 1111 20th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036. Every appeal file shall include the following: andbullet; A memorandum of transmittal from the RA to the Chief AdministrativeLaw Judge;andbullet; A completed Form DL 1-126, Records Authentication Certificate,affixed with the seal of the U.S. Department of Labor, and signed by therecords custodian and Regional authentication officer; andbullet; An appeal index; and andbullet; A paginated appeal file arranged in ``reverse'' chronologicalorder, i.e., with the most recent document first. RAs must also forward a copy of the appeal file by next day delivery to:Solicitor of Labor, Attn: Associate Solicitor for Employment and TrainingLegal Services, Room N-2101, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 ConstitutionAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210 The Administrative Law Judge will act on the employer's request for expeditedadministrative review within five working days following receipt of theappeal file. The Administrative Law Judge may affirm, reverse, or modifythe RA's decision, but may not remand the case file to the RA, or considernew evidence in reaching a decision. The Administrative Law Judge, in acting on the employer's request for a<T3>de novo </T3>hearing, will schedule a hearing within five working daysfollowing receipt of the appeal file, and will render a decision withinten working days following the hearing. The Administrative Law Judge mayaffirm, reverse, or modify the RA's decision. The DOL is represented in appeals solely by designated employees in theOffice of the Solicitor of Labor. Regional Office and SESA staff are expectedto be available to testify at these hearings if the need arises. Pendinga decision by the Administrative Law Judge, all communications with theOffice of the Administrative Law Judges, the employer, or the employer'srepresentative, must be made through the Solicitor's Office. D. Recruitment The active recruitment of U.S. workers is an integral part of the laborcertification process. This requires positive action on the part of theemployer and coordination and cooperation throughout the Employment Servicesystem. As the statute provides, labor certification may not be issuedif ``the Secretary determines that the employer has not made positive recruitmentefforts within a multi-state region of traditional or expected labor supply''upon being advised by the Secretary of a significant number of qualifiedU.S. workers. The law further states that this effort is in addition tothe recruitment through ``the interstate employment service system''. Inmaking a finding of U.S. worker availability, the RA must have accuratedocumentation from Employment Service offices and from the employer ofthe efforts put forth by the employer and the SESA and the recruitmentresults. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Definition of ``U.S. Worker'' </ITAG>This term means any worker (non-H-2A) who is legally permitted to workin the United States in the job opportunity. This would include U.S. citizensand aliens who have temporary or permanent resident status or nonimmigrantaliens who have authorization for such employment. Examples of documentsevidencing work authorization are set forth in the instructions to INSForm I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification. Special Agricultural Workers(SAW) will also be considered to be U.S. workers under the following conditions:a. The worker has applied for adjustment of status, and received INS FormI-688A (Temporary Employment Authorization) granting temporary employmentauthorization and the authorized period has not expired (Note: Form I-688Ais given an alien pending final determination on application for temporaryresident status.); b. A worker who has been granted temporary resident status and has beenissued Form I-688, Temporary Resident Card, authorizing employment andtravel abroad; in this case the alien has the right to reside in the UnitedStates and accept employment in the same manner as an alien lawfully admittedfor permanent resident status; or c. A worker whose status has been adjusted to permanent resident statusand has been issued Form I-551, Alien Registration Receipt Card. An alienwho has applied for legalization under 8 CFR Part 245a will be considereda U.S. worker under the same circumstances outlined for SAW workers. Theseare aliens who resided continuously and unlawfully in the United Statessince January 1, 1982, and who have applied for legalization.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Local Recruitment </ITAG>The actual recruitment of local workers for the job opportunity may bethe most important aspect of the recruitment process. The experience ofthe Employment Service system over the years has indicated that a goodproportion of workers responding to employer job offers are from the communityin the area of employment. At the time an agricultural employer files an application for H-2A workerswith the RA, a copy is also submitted to the appropriate Employment Serviceoffice. The local office uses the job offer part of the application toprepare a local order and begins the recruitment process for U.S. workersin the local area. An agricultural clearance order is not extended intrastateand interstate until the H-2A application and clearance order have beenapproved by the RA. Referral on the local order will continue until fiftypercent of the contract period is completed. Employers are required to identify on their H-2A applications the totalnumber of workers the employer anticipates hiring in the agricultural laboror service activity during the covered period of employment. For example,the employer may normally use one hundred workers to pick apples, but expectsto hire forty local workers, as it has done for a number of years, and,therefore, is seeking H-2A certification for sixty workers for whom housingwhich meets standards is being provided. In such situations, as housingis not required for local workers, the employer should be advised to filea local job order for the forty workers needed. The local order shouldoffer the minimum wages, benefits, and working conditions in the employer'sH-2A job offer, except for housing, transportation, and meals, and localworkers referred and hired on this job order should not be counted by theSESA or the Regional Office as being ``available'' for certification determinationpurposes on the H-2A application and the clearance order that is processedin conjunction with it. This situation applies only when the local officecan substantiate that a separate local job order is being used for recruiting<T3>only </T3>local workers for whom housing is not a condition of employment.In the example given, when the local office has satisfied the employer'shistorical local labor needs by filling the local order for 40 workerswith 40 local referrals and hires, then the local office would continueto refer local workers on the clearance order to supplement out-of-areareferrals being made, and these local referrals would then be counted as``available'' for certification determination purposes and reported assuch to the Regional Office. When such situations do occur, the RegionalOffice and the SESA will have to work closely together in order to insurethat referrals and ``available U.S. workers'' are accurately reported.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Notice of Required Recruitment </ITAG>Upon review and determination that the H-2A application meets the requirementsof the regulations at 20 CFR 655.101-655.103, the RA advises the employerthat the application has been accepted. The notice also advises the employerand the State agency of the recruitment efforts for U.S. workers whichmust be made, taking into account the acceptability of the employer's positiverecruitment plan submitted with the application and incorporating this,where possible, into the notice. This would include specific advertisingin newspapers and/or radio, as well as placing the job order into intrastateand interstate clearance to potential supply States. This will be a signalto the local and State Employment Service that recruitment is to be expandedbeyond the local geographic area. The notice shall, when appropriate, also require the employer to performpositive recruitment efforts in specific areas of traditional or expectedworker supply other than the area of intended employment. In determiningthe scope of positive recruitment, the RA will consider: a. The normal recruitment practices of non-H-2A agricultural employerswho employ similar workers and are of comparable or smaller size to theH-2A employer; and b. Information received from State agencies or other sources that thereare a significant number of qualified workers who would likely be availablethrough a face to face interview. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Positive Recruitment by Employer (See also Chapter I, Section B,2)</ITAG>Positive recruitment is defined in the regulations as ``the active participationof an employer or its authorized hiring agent in locating and interviewingapplicants in other potential labor supply areas and in the area wherethe employer's establishment is located in an effort to fill specific jobopenings''. a. <T3>Positive Recruitment Plan. </T3>At the time of application, the employermust present a plan for conducting positive recruitment of U.S. workersincluding specific steps to be taken, such as contacting former employeesor negotiating with specific farm labor contractors. This plan, which canbe a series of brief statements, should address recruitment that will bein addition to the normal filing of a local job order and the extensionof the agricultural clearance order through the interstate system. Theemployer may use Form ETA 750, Part A, Item 21, for this purpose. The employershould describe recruitment efforts for U.S. workers made prior to filingthe application, although the RA is precluded from requiring such domesticworker recruitment prior to submittal of an application.The employer should consider the recruitment efforts and locations whichnon-H-2A agricultural employers of comparable or smaller size have successfullyutilized previously and either set forth a plan or agree to conduct recruitmentin the same manner as that conducted by such non-H-2A employers. The employer should also describe efforts to locate and utilize farm laborcontractors when it is the prevailing practice of non-H-2A employers inthe area of employment and for the occupation. b. <T3>Cooperation with the Employment Service. </T3>The employer agrees tocomply with the assurances set forth in the regulations at 20 CFR 655.103.One of these assurances is to cooperate with the Employment Service systemin the active recruitment of U.S. workers by assisting the Employment Servicein preparing agricultural clearance orders and permitting the order tobe cleared through the Employment Service system. This will include advertising the job opportunity in newspapers and/oron radio. This may be required in a language other than English, if theRA believes it is appropriate. When positive recruitment is undertakenand the applicant holding office requests it, similar advertising shallbe used in conjunction with such recruitment. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Recruitment after Certification (See also Chapter I, Section B,1) </ITAG>The employer's positive recruitment obligation continues until the H-2Aworkers certified have departed for the employer's place of work. In orderto establish a cut off time for such active recruitment, the employer mustnotify the local office in writing of the exact date that the H-2A workersdeparted for employment. A copy of this communication should also be sentto the RA. The employer cannot be required to engage in positive recruitmentefforts on or after the date of departure of H-2A workers for the placeof work. The referral of workers by the Employment Service does not end on the H-2Adeparture date mentioned above. The employer must keep an active orderon file until fifty percent of the work period has been completed, exceptfor ``small'' employers exempted by the regulations at 20 CFR 655.106(f).The ES system will continue to refer U.S. workers who apply as long asthere is an active job order on file. However, active recruitment on thepart of the SESA should cease when the employer advises that H-2A workersare enroute to the place of employment. E. Certification Determinations <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Definition_RA Role </ITAG>The regulations define a ``temporary alien agricultural certification determination''as the written determination of the RA to approve or deny a temporary alienagricultural certification application. The application is filed directlywith the RA. The RA has the authority to approve or deny, in whole or in part, and toaccept for consideration, applications for temporary alien agriculturallabor certification. The RA may delegate all or part of this authorityto a designated Regional Office staff member. The Regional Certifying Officerwould be one obvious designee. Under the regulations, the RA or a designee usually makes certificationdeterminations. The Director, U.S. Employment Service (or the Director'sdesignee), may also make certification determinations when special circumstanceswarrant. What constitutes special circumstances will be decided by theDirector as the need arises. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Denials </ITAG>The determination to approve or deny certification must be made no laterthan twenty calendar days before the employer's stated date of need, unlessother provisions of the regulations apply. Factors which would delay theissuance of a certification determination include the submittal of an untimelymodified application resulting in a day-for-day postponement of the certificationdate. If the certification is denied, the determination must be in writing andmailed to the employer by any means reasonably intended to assure nextday delivery. A copy of the determination should also be mailed to theSESA. The RA's denial notice must: andbullet; State the reasons for denial, including citations to the relevantregulatory standards; andbullet; Offer the applicant an opportunity to request an expedited administrativereview or <T3>de novo </T3>hearing; and andbullet; State that if the employer does not request an expedited administrativereview or a hearing within seven calendar days, no further considerationof the employer's application will be made by any DOL official.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Bases for Denial in Whole or in Part </ITAG>Certification requests may be denied in whole or in part. The RA must denya temporary alien agricultural labor certification for the employment ofH-2A workers in its entirety if sufficient U.S. workers are available tofill all of the employer's job opportunities. If U.S. workers are availableto fill a portion of the employer's job opportunities, certification mustbe denied for that part of the request for which U.S. workers are available.The regulations provide that no U.S. worker may be referred to an employerunless the worker has been made aware of the terms, conditions, and qualificationsfor the job, and has indicated that he/she meets the qualifications andis able, willing, and eligible (as defined in the regulations) to takethe job. Local offices are encouraged to provide the worker with a copyof Form WH-455 (Information on Wage and Working Conditions), listing thematerial terms and conditions of the job offer, for this purpose. U.S.workers are not required to read the entire job order, or to have it readto them, to obtain the required pre-referral familiarity with the job offer.No signed statement by the referring ES official or the worker is necessaryin order to comply with this requirement. The RA may consider a U.S. worker likely to sign a work contract with anemployer if the RA has information that the worker was referred to theemployer and was told by the employer to report for the job opportunity.The RA should also consider as available not only those workers whom theemployer has rejected for other than lawful, job-related reasons, but alsothose workers for whom the employer has provided no reason for rejection.The regulations, therefore, now codify the longstanding practice of DOLto deduct ``outstanding'' referrals from the employer's certification request.In order for the RA to make the required determination of unavailabilityon certification day, the employer's recruitment report (which was requiredby the RA in the acceptance letter) should be received in the RegionalOffice no later than three calendar days prior to the scheduled certificationdate. The RA should advise the employer in the acceptance letter that thecertification may be delayed if the report is not received in a timelymanner. However, the RA may not deny the certification solely because thewritten report has not been submitted. If delays are encountered, the RAshould contact the employer by telephone to secure the required information.If attempts to do this are unsuccessful, then the RA may delay the certificationdetermination until the employer is contacted or the written report isreceived. In addition, the local office should telephone the RA with its own recruitmentreport no later than three calendar days prior to the certification date.The telephone report should later be confirmed in writing. The local officeshould also telephone the RA on the date of certification if there hasbeen any change in its earlier report. If no update is provided, the RAwill assume the report is final, and will base a certification determinationon the facts at hand. The RA must also deny labor certification if the employer has not compliedwith the adverse effect criteria in the regulation at 20 CFR 655.102; ifthe employer has not complied with the workers' compensation requirementsat 20 CFR 655.102(b)(2) and provided proof of such coverage; and if theemployer has not complied with the positive recruitment requirements setforth by the RA. The regulations specifically provide that the RA may not certify if anemployer has substantially violated a material term or condition of anH-2A labor certification within the past two years. Such violation mustinitially be raised in the context of the regulations at 20 CFR 655.110,which grants certain appeal rights to the employer. Denial of labor certificationon the basis of a substantial violation may not be invoked until the RA'sdetermination has been finalized through the DOL appeal process. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Appeals </ITAG>The administrative appeal provisions relating to a denial of labor certificationare the same as those for unacceptable applications. In each case, theprovisions in the regulations at 20 CFR 655.112 must be followed. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Certifications Granted </ITAG>The RA's notification to an employer that a temporary labor certificationfor H-2A workers has been granted in whole or in part should consist of:a letter outlining the terms and conditions of the labor certification(see the Appendices for a sample transmittal letter); and a bill for grantingthe H-2A certification, in whole or in part, indicating that the fee isnonrefundable and containing instructions for payment within thirty calendardays. RAs shall transmit certification determinations to the employer by meansnormally assuring next day delivery. Further, employers may arrange withRegional Office staff for other means of pick up or delivery. RAs shouldmail copies of the transmittal letter to the State and local offices.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Fees </ITAG>The regulations require that employers will be billed for receiving anH-2A labor certification at the time the certification is granted. Employerswill be charged a fee of $100 for each H-2A certification granted (in wholeor in part), plus an additional $10 for each H-2A position certified bythe RA, up to a maximum fee of $1,000 per certification. Fees are not charged for redeterminations. If an employer chooses not topetition INS for visas for the total number of workers needed to fill theH-2A positions for which certification has been granted, such a decisiondoes not relieve the employer of the obligation to pay the $10 fee foreach job opportunity certified (up to $1,000 maximum). Procedures for billing and processing payments for fees are contained inFM No. 73-87, July 23, 1987. (See also Appendix J.) F. Post-Certification Activities <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Determinations on Changes Requested After Certification </ITAG>a. <T3>Terms and Conditions. </T3>The labor certification determination isa finding that the labor market has been sufficiently tested for determinationof U.S. worker availability and that the adverse effect criteria have beenmet. Such determination is based upon the terms and conditions of the joboffer and assurances. If an employer wishes to make any changes in the<T3>level </T3>of benefits, wages, and working conditions at any time duringthe work contract period, the employer must make written application toand obtain approval of the RA. The RA must carefully consider the followingin making this determination: andbullet; Is the level of benefits more advantageous to workers? andbullet; If the benefits had been offered initially, what effect wouldthere have been on U.S. worker availability? and andbullet; Are the amendments merely technical or procedural? Each request for change must be reviewed and approval considered on a caseby case basis. Where the changes in the level of benefits are the resultof DOL regulation changes (AEWRs, meal charges, etc.), the employer neednot obtain approval of the RA. b. <T3>Extension of Time Period. </T3>The temporary agricultural labor certificationis for a specific period of time which coincides with the employer's joboffer. If H-2A workers are needed beyond this period of time, the certificationperiod may be extended under certain conditions and procedures. Beforetaking such action, the employer should carefully determine if the periodof additional need is of a short term duration of two weeks or less orfor a longer term of extension. andbullet; <T3>Short Term Extension. </T3>If the period of extension is two weeksor less, the employer need only apply to the INS. If INS grants the extension,the certification period will be deemed to be that approved by INS. Thiswill not require any action by DOL or the SESA in effecting such changes.Exception: If the original duration of certification is for a very shortperiod of time, such as one week, INS will not grant a two-week extension.INS's extensions will be limited to a period of time not to exceed theoriginal certification period.andbullet; <T3>Long Term Extension. </T3>If an extension is needed beyond the periodwhich INS would grant on a short-term basis, an employer may apply to theRA for an extension of the certification period. The written request shouldbe made after fifty percent of the work contract period has been completed.The written request should support the request for extension by explainingwhy the extension could not have been foreseen by the employer at the timeof filing the application; and by describing what factors beyond the controlof the employer made the extension necessary, such as weather, increasedcrop forecast, or unforeseen market conditions. The RA shall not grant an extension if the employer has already been granteda short term extension by INS. Also, the RA shall not grant an extension,except under highly unusual and extraordinary circumstances, where theextension would bring the total certification period to twelve months ormore. When such extraordinary circumstances arise the RA should conferwith the National Office before making a determination. Upon consideration of all the facts and information, the RA must grantor deny the certification extension request and notify the employer inwriting of the decision. This decision is final agency action, and no furtheradministrative review is permitted. If the extension request is denied,the employer may submit a new temporary alien agricultural labor certificationapplication. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Flexibility for Associations in Utilizing Certified Workers </ITAG>a. <T3>Joint Employer Relationship. </T3>If an association is already identifiedas a joint employer, the temporary agricultural labor certification grantedshall be made jointly to the association and to its specified employermembers. The workers may be transferred among employer members of the associationunder the following conditions: andbullet; Work is limited to that permitted in the certification of thedescribed job opportunity, and housing, which has met applicable standards,is available. andbullet; The association controls the assignment of such workers and maintainsa record of such assignments. andbullet; Workers may not be transferred to any employer member who is ineligibleto receive workers as a result of certification penalties imposed pursuantto the regulation at 20 CFR 655.110. b. <T3>Sole Employer Relationship. </T3>The temporary alien agricultural laborcertification is granted to the association only. The certified job opportunities,in this case, may be used by any of its members except an ineligible employermember described above. c. <T3>Association as an Agent.</T3> For purposes of compliance with the fiftypercent rule only, an association acting as an agent for its employer membersmay be permitted to transfer workers among individual growers and willnot be considered a joint employer with all the attendant responsibilitiesby doing so. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Redeterminations for Shortfall </ITAG>After a certification determination has been made, an employer may requesta new determination based on non-availability of able, willing, qualified,and eligible U.S. workers. This request may be made at any time after theofficial determination is rendered by the RA. The employer is not requiredto wait until the date of need to make an assertion of non-availability.The regulations provide that a labor certification determination must bemade no later than twenty days before the expected date of need, unlessreduced by a day-for-day postponement for not timely submitting a correctedacceptable application. Because of this early certification determination,it may happen that workers initially found to be available will not reportfor work at the time and place needed. Further, the employer may assertthat other workers may not be ``eligible'' in terms of being legally permittedto work in the U.S. or that specific U.S. workers are not able, willingand qualified for the job opportunity. The employer may request a new determination in such cases. The requestmay be made by telephone to the RA but must be promptly (within 72 hours)confirmed by the employer in writing. The RA must make a new determinationwithin seventy-two hours after a telephone or written request is received.<T3>This is a statutory requirement. </T3>The following procedures apply:a. <T3>Workers Not Able, Willing, Qualified, or Eligible. </T3>When an employerasserts that any worker counted as available in the previous determinationis not an ``eligible'' worker (legally entitled to work) or is not able,willing, or qualified to perform the job, the employer must provide a signedstatement supporting this assertion within seventy-two hours after makinga redetermination request. The employer must identify each worker and providea specific lawful job-related reason for rejecting or terminating sucha worker.For redetermination requests related to workers alleged to be not able,willing, qualified, or eligible, the burden of proof for such assertionsrests with the employer, as the statute provides. Without a written statementof facts from the employer, the RA may not approve a redetermination requestof this nature. However, the RA must render a determination to disapprovethe request within seventy-two hours of the initial request made by telephone.b. <T3>Workers Not Available. </T3>If the employer requests a new determinationsolely on the basis of worker non-availability, the employer is requiredto submit a written confirmation within seventy-two hours. However, ifthe employer does not provide a written confirmation within seventy-twohours, the RA may make a new determination to approve the request basedsolely on the information provided by the employer by telephone, and anyconfirming information which may be provided by the local office. Again,the RA's redetermination must be made within seventy-two hours after receiptof the employer's request, as required by statute. c. <T3>Regional Office Review and Determination. </T3>The RA shall reviewthe request promptly and issue a determination within seventy-two hoursas specified above. This process should include the following actions:andbullet; The RA may request supporting information on U.S. worker non-availabilityor other relevant factors from the Job Service order holding office. andbullet; Prior to making a determination, the RA will ascertain throughreliable sources of information (SESAs or other) whether able, willing,and qualified replacement U.S. workers are available and can realisticallybe expected to report to the employer's establishment for work within theseventy-two hours from the date the employer's request was received. If the RA cannot identify sufficient qualified U.S. workers who are likelyto be available, the RA should grant the employer's new determination requestin whole or in part. The notification must be in writing and sent by meansusually ensuring next day delivery. The RA's determination in this instanceshall be the final decision of the Secretary, and no further review willbe made by any DOL official. The employer is not entitled to an expeditedadministrative review or <T3>de novo </T3>hearing before an administrative law judge on redetermination.Employers may submit countervailing evidence to INS in such instances.However, this does not preclude an employer from subsequently filing anew request for a new determination based on subsequent shortfalls of U.S.workers. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. </ITAG><T3>Application of the Fifty Percent Rule </T3>(See also Chapter I, SectionB, 2) The fifty percant rule relates to the first half of the total period ofthe work contract; during this time the employer must continue to provideemployment to any qualified, eligible U.S. worker who may apply to theemployer for employment. This continues even though labor certificationhas been granted to an employer, and H-2A workers are at the job site.The ES system and the employer must actively recruit U.S. workers for thejob opportunity until the date that H-2A workers depart for the employer'splace of work. From the date of such departure, the order must remain open,and the employer must continue to accept and employ workers who apply forthe job opportunity until fifty percent of the period of the work contract(under which the alien worker was hired) has elapsed. The ES System shouldnot actively recruit U.S. workers after the H-2A workers have arrived,but must refer workers who apply to H-2A employers if there is no suitablealternative employment available or if the worker expresses a preferencefor an H-2A employer's opening. In addition, the employer must offer to provide housing to any non-commutingworker. If the employer cannot provide employment and housing to both theU.S. worker and H-2A worker, the employer may have to make other arrangementsfor the H-2A worker. Neither DOL nor the State ageucy have any active roleto play or responsibility in such situations, and should not advise theemployer on an appropriate course of action, except on an informal basis.Employers should be advised to consult with INS when such circumstancesoccur. There is an exception to the fifty percent rule. It does not apply to asmall employer who did not use more than five hundred man days of agriculturallabor (as defined by the FLSA) during any calendar quarter during the precedingcalendar year and is not a member of an association which has applied forH-2A workers. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Application of the Three-Fourths Guarantee </ITAG>The three-fourths guarantee of employment applies to the entire work contractperiod, including any extensions thereof. The purpose of such a guaranteeis to ensure a certain level of sustained opportunity for employment andwages during the period of labor certification. As part of the job offer, the employer ``shall guarantee to offer the workeremployment for at least three-fourths of the workdays of the total periodduring which the work contract and all extension thereof are in effect''.Thus, any additional wages which may be due as a result of the three-fourthsguarantee can be computed only at the end of a season (or termination ofthe contract period). The guarantee applies to all employees in the occupation on the job offer,both U.S. and H-2A workers. In applying this guarantee and determiningany additional wages due, certain facts must be established. a. <T3>The Beginning Date and Ending Date of Employment. </T3>The beginningdate of the guarantee period is the first workday after arrival of theworker at the place of work. The ending date is the last date of expirationof the work contract and any extensions, or the termination date as establishedunder the contract impossibility clause. b. <T3>The Number of Workdays between the Established Beginning and EndingDates of the Guarantee Period. </T3>The normal workdays are establishedin the job offer; e.g., five days, Monday through Friday; six days, Mondaythrough Saturday; etc. The number of workdays in the established guaranteeperiod are reduced by: (1) non-workdays established in the job offer; (2)worker's Sabbath, unless established as a non-workday; and (3) federalholidays.c. <T3>The Establishment of Hours of Worktime for the Guarantee Period. </T3>Thenumber of hours in the workday is established by the job offer. The totalnumber of hours of worktime in the contract period is simply the productof workdays establiahed multiplied by specified hours. d. The three-fourths guarantee of employment is established by computing75% of the established total hours of worktime in the contract period.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 1: </T4>An agricultural employer requests workers during theperiod from July l, 1987, through September 30, 1987. The job offer specifieseight hours of work for five days each week, Monday through Friday. Theworkers arrive on June 30, 1987. Therefore, the period of the work contractis for ninety-two calandar days. There are twenty-eight non-workdays duringthis period of sixty-four workdays: thirteen Saturdays, thirteen Sundays,and two federal holidays. This leaves sixty-four workdays during the contractperiod. Therefore, the three-fourths guarantee would total three hundredand eighty-four hours (75% of 8 hours/workday x 64 workdays).</ITAG>The employer must maintain payroll records which show the number of hoursoffered each day and the number of hours actually worked each day. Thisdaily record should also clearly account for the reason(s) a worker didnot work the full number of hours offered.In essence, the number of hours of available work per day is simply thesum of the number of hours actually worked plus any hours offered but notworked (up to the maximum number of daily work hours specified in the clearanceorder). In meeting the three-fourths guarantee, the worker cannot be required towork for more than the number of hours specified for a day on the job offer.Also, the worker cannot be required to work on the worker's Sabbath ora federal holiday. However, the worker may volunteer to work more than the specified hoursfor a day or to work on his/her Sabbath or to work on a federal holiday.In such cases, the hours actually worked may be counted toward meetingthe three-fourths guarantee. However, the employer may not count any hoursoffered on such days in which the worker refused or failed to work. If,for example, a worker voluntarily worked four hours on a Sabbath when eighthours were offered by the employer, the employer may take credit only forfour hours in meeting the three-fourths guarantee.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Example 2: </T4>Example 1 above reflects a three-fourths guaranteeof three hundred and eighty-four hours during an employment period fromJuly 1, 1987, through September 30, 1987. Now assume that an H-2A worker'sdaily record reflects the following data for this period: a total of threehundred and twenty hours actually worked <T3>plus </T3>a total of thirty-two hours which the worker refused withinnormal, specified workdays. All three hundred and fifty-two of these hours(320+32) may be credited towarda the three-fourth guarantee.</ITAG>In this case the employer would still have to pay the worker thirty-twohours (384-352) of supplemental wages. If the worker is employed by thehour, the supplemental pay would be thirty-two hours times the hourly ratespecified on the job offer. If the worker has been paid on a piece rate,or other incentive basis, the worker's average hourly piece rate earningsor the job offer hourly rate, whichever is higher, would be used to calculatethe amount due under the guarantee. Employment Service personnel and other appropriate staff should be familiarwith the methodology in calculating the guaranteed wage, but the enforcementof the three-fourths guarantee is the responsibility of the EmploymentStandards Administration (ESA). G. Monitoring, Enforcement, Complaints, and Penalties <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Fraud and Willful Misrepresentation </ITAG>a. <T3>Referral for Investigation. </T3>The RA must refer the following mattersto the Immigration and Naturalization Service and DOL Office of the InspectorGeneral: andbullet; Any possible fraud or willful misrepresentation discovered bythe RA prior to final labor certification determination; and andbullet; Any discovery by the RA that the employer is the subject of acriminal indictment or information filed in a court, with respect to theemployer's application. b. <T3>Continued Processing. </T3>Until (and unless) a court or the Immigrationand Naturalization Service determines that there was fraud or willful misrepresentation,the RA must continue processing the application of an employer referredfor investigation and may eventually grant certification.c. <T3>Terminated Processing. </T3>Any H-2A application determined by a courtor the Immigration and Naturalization Service to involve fraud or willfulmisrepresentation thereby becomes invalid, and the RA must: andbullet; Terminate consideration of the application; and andbullet; Return the application to the employer, with reasons stated inwriting. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Employment Service Complaint System (20 CFR Part 658, Subpart E)</ITAG>If workers hired under the specific conditions of an H-2A job order, orother workers in corresponding employment employed by an H-2A employer,file complaints with the local office under the Employment Service ComplaintSystem regarding alleged noncompliance by employers of H-2A workers, suchcomplaints will be referred promptly by the local office to the appropriateoffice of the Employment Standards Administration (ESA), Wage and HourDivision, for action and resolution. In referring such complaints, thelocal office should follow the procedures set forth in the complaint systemregulations at 20 CFR Part 658, Subpart E. The ESA Wage and Hour Division office may report the results of its investigationto the appropriate RA for consideration of employer sanctions under theregulation at 20 CFR 655.110 or for such other action as may be appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Noncompliance with Terms and Conditions of Temporary Alien AgriculturalLabor Certifications </ITAG>a. <T3>Employment and Training Administration (ETA) Investigation of Violations.</T3>Certain investigative functions deemed necessary to carry out provisionsof law and regulations have been delegated by the Secretary of Labor tothe RA. In general, matters concerning the obligations of an employer related tothe labor certification process are administered and enforced by the ETA,primarily by the appropriate RA in the region of intended employment. If the RA has reason to believe that an employer has violated a materialterm or condition of certification, then the RA must either investigatethe matter himself/herself, or refer to information and recommendationsfrom an ESA investigation of the matter, to determine one of the following:andbullet; A substantial violation has occurred; andbullet; A less than substantial violation has occurred; or andbullet; No violation has occurred. By statute, the Secretary of Labor is required to deny an H-2A certificationif the employer has committed a substantial violation of a material termor condition of an H-2A certification during the past two years. The H-2A regulations define a substantial violation, first, as one or moreacts of commission or omission by an employer, with respect to which theRA determines: andbullet; That the act(s) is/are significantly injurious to the wages, benefits,or working conditions of 10% or more of the employer's workforce; <T3>and </T3>andbullet; The employer either has failed to comply with penalties or ordersimposed pursuant to ESA regulations for such acts; <T3>or</T3> the employer has engaged in a pattern or practice of such acts.Other acts which are deemed substantial violations include: andbullet; Impeding an ETA or ESA investigation of the employer institutedpursuant to ETA's or ESA's H-2A regulations;  andbullet; Not paying required fee(s) in a timely manner; andbullet; Having been found to be currently ineligible to apply for certificationdue to failure to comply with terms of H-2 certification granted beforeJune 1, 1987; and andbullet; Fraud and/or willful misrepresentation by the employer duringthe process of applying for labor certification. If, in the RA's judgment, there were extenuating circumstances involvedwith any of these actions, the RA should weigh the influence of such circumstanceson the situation at issue. The RA may then decide that they were sufficientlyameliorating to preclude a finding that a substantial violation was involved.Likewise, a less than substantial violation is an act of commission oromission which the RA determines violates the H-2A regulations, but whichis not a substantial violation as defined above. b. <T3>ESA Investigation </T3>(See also 29 CFR Part 501). Certain investigativefunctions deemed necessary to carry out the provisions of law and regulationshave been delegated by the Secretary of Labor to the ESA.In general, matters concerning the obligations on the work contract betweenan employer of H-2A workers and the U.S. and H-2A workers are enforcedby the ESA, Wage and Hour Division. The ESA, Wage and Hour Division, hasthe authority and responsibility to conduct investigations and inspectionsregarding such matters as the payment of required wages, transportation,meals, and housing provided during the period of employment. The areas where ESA has such jurisdiction are generally limited to actualevents that transpire when there is an employer-employee relationship,and an employee's complaint must be limited to events that occur as a resultof that relationship in order for ESA to assume responsibility for enforcement.The RA may use an appropriate ESA investigative report or finding as thebasis for determining whether an employer has violated a term or conditionof certification. Regional Offices should provide copies of approved H-2A applications, acceptableamendments to job orders, notices of certification determinations, andany other documentation deemed relevant for enforcement purposes to theirRegional ESA counterparts. More specific procedures for the ETA/ESA interfaceon matters related to H-2A investigations, such as coordination of fieldwork, are being developed and will be provided to Regional Offices (ETAand ESA) at a later date. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Penalties </ITAG>a. <T3>ESA Penalties. </T3>If it is determined that H-2A work contract provisionshave been violated, then the ESA, Wage and Hour Division, may take anyof the following actions: andbullet; Institute appropriate administrative proceedings, including theenforcement of any contractual obligation, the recovery of unpaid wages,and the assessment of a civil money penalty; andbullet; Petition an appropriate U.S. District Court for injunctive relief,including the withholding of unpaid wages, against any violating employer;and andbullet; Petition an appropriate U.S. District Court for specific performanceof contractual obligations. In addition, the ESA, Wage and Hour Division, must report any violationfound to the appropriate RA for ETA in the region where the violation occurredand must forward appropriate investigative information to the RA for consideration.The ESA, Wage and Hour Division, may also recommend to the RA the denialof future labor certification. All penalties invoked by the ESA, Wage and Hour Division, are treated separatelyfrom sanctions available to the RA for ETA. An employer's obligations tocomply with ESA penalties does not absolve an employer from potential ETAsanctions. b. <T3>ETA Sanctions for Substantial Violations. </T3>If the RA determinesthat a substantial violation has occurred, then the RA must notify theemployer that certification will not be granted for the next period oftime during a calendar year in which the employer would be expected torequest certification. If the RA determines that two substantial violations have occurred, orthe same violation has been repeated, then the RA may notify the employerthat certification will not be granted for any period within the next twocalendar years. Likewise, if the RA determines that three or more substantial violations,or repetitions thereof, have occurred, then the RA may notify the employerthat certification will not be granted for any period within the next threecalendar years. The RA's notice must be in writing, state the reason(s) for the sanction(s),and offer the employer an opportunity for an administrative review or <T3>de novo </T3>hearing on the sanction(s) within seven calendar daysas prescribed in 20 CFR 655.112. c. <T3>Requirement of Special Procedures for Less Than Substantial Violations.</T3>If the RA determines that a less than substantial violation has occurred,then the RA may require, as a condition for certification, the employerto comply with special procedures designed to enhance the recruitment andretention of U.S. workers in the next year. Any special procedures required by the RA must be reasonable and no morethan deemed necessary to assure employer compliance with criteria for availabilityof and adverse effect on U.S. workers. These cannot include any requirementthat the employer offer better wages, benefits, and working conditionsthan those specified in the regulations at 20 CFR 655.102. The following are illustrative of the special procedures which could beimposed, as appropriate: andbullet; Prohibiting the employer from administering any pre-hiring testof agility or other physical skill;andbullet; Requiring the employer to install extra phone lines and provideextra staff assistance to interview by telephone workers being referredfrom out of the area; andbullet; Requiring the employer to be available seven days a week, from8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., to interview applicants during the recruitmentperiod; andbullet; Prohibiting the employer from requiring applicants to providereferences as a condition of applying for the job; andbullet; Requiring the employer to extend the minimum training/breaking-inperiod on the job, if one is normally required; andbullet; Requiring the employer to delegate the authority to make a hiringcommitment to an Employment Service representative; andbullet; Requiring the employer to restructure certain job components (suchas the substitution of lighter weight ladders for heavier ones); and andbullet; Prohibiting the employer from requiring experience in the occupationwhen such a requirement is not unequivocally supportable by the DOT. The RA must notify the employer in writing of any required special procedures.The notice must also state the reason(s) for requiring special procedures,that the special procedures become part of the terms of certification,and that the employer has an opportunity to appeal the requirement of specialprocedures within seven calendar days. Failure to comply with the special procedures imposed under appropriatecircumstances will result in an employer's otherwise approved labor certificationbeing reduced by twenty-five percent of the job opportunities otherwiseapprovable. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Applicability of Penalties to Associations </ITAG>a. <T3>Penalties Involving Members of Joint Employer Associations. </T3>If,after appropriate investigation, the RA determines that an individual producermember of a joint employer association has committed a substantial violation,the denial of certification penalty shall apply only to that member ofthe association unless the RA determines that the association or otherassociation member participated in, had knowledge of, or had reason toknow of the violation. In such a case the penalty shall be invoked againstthe association or other association member as well. b. <T3>Penalties Involving Associations Acting as Joint Employers. </T3>Ifthe RA determines that an association acting as a joint employer with itsmembers has committed a substantial violation, then the RA's sanction denyingcertification applies only to the association, unless a member of the associationis determined by the RA to have participated in, had knowledge of, or reasonto know of the violation. c. <T3>Penalties Involving Associations Acting as Sole Employers. </T3>Ifthe RA determines that an association acting as a sole employer has committeda substantial violation, then the RA's sanction denying certification tothe association means that no individual producer member shall be permittedto employ certified H-2A workers in the crop and occupation for which theH-2A workers had been previously certified. However, any individual producermember of the association may apply for certification in either the capacityof an individual employer or as a member of a joint employer association.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Appeals of Penalties </ITAG>Any administrative penalty assessed by the ESA, Wage and Hour Division,or any sanctions or special requirements imposed by the RA may be appealedby the employer. The manner and time frame for such appeals must be statedin the written notification to the employer and are set forth at 20 CFR655.112 (for ETA) and at 29 CFR Part 501, Subpart C (for ESA). 7. <T3>Abuses Under Fifty Percent Rule </T3>(See also Chapter I, Section F,4). The regulations at 20 CFR 655.106(g) implement the provisions of theH-2A program which prohibit persons from withholding U.S. workers undercertain circumstances. Any person who has reason to believe that a personor entity has willfully and knowingly withheld U.S. workers prior to thearrival at the job site of H-2A workers in order to force the hiring ofU.S. workers may submit a written complaint to the local office. The complaintshall clearly identify the person or entity whom the employer believeshas withheld the U.S. workers, and shall specify sufficient facts to supportthe allegation (i.e., dates, places, numbers, and names of U.S. workers)which will permit an investigation to be conducted by the local office.Upon receipt of a written complaint, the local office will take the stepslisted below. andbullet; Review the complaint to make sure all necessary information hasbeen furnished. If information is missing, the employer should be contactedby phone and requested to supply it.andbullet; Telephone the Regional Office and advise that the local officehas received the complaint, and provide relevant information requestedby the Regional Office. andbullet; Immediately investigate the complaint, including the conduct ofthe interviews specified in the regulations. If the local office is unableto conduct some or any of the interviews, the Regional Office should benotified immediately by telephone so the Regional Office can conduct anyinterviews that the local office cannot conduct. andbullet; Within five (5) working days after receipt of the complaint, prepareand submit directly to the Regional Office (with a copy to the State office)a report of findings, including recommendations, as well as the originalof the employer's complaint. Upon receipt of the original complaint and the report of findings fromthe local office, the Regional Office will take the following steps: andbullet; Immediately review both and conduct any additional investigationdeemed appropriate, including any interviews still needed. andbullet; No later than thirty-six working hours after receipt of the complaintand report of findings, issue written findings to the local office andthe employer, with a copy to the State office. Where the RA determines that the employer's complaint is valid and justified,the RA shall immediately suspend the application of the fifty percent requirementspecified in the regulations at 20 CFR 655.103(e), provided that no suchsuspension shall take place until the interviews required by the regulationsat 20 CFR 655.106(g) have been conducted. Where the RA determines that the employer's complaint is not valid andjustified, the RA will notify the employer, the local office, and the Stateoffice of the determination in writing. The RA's determination shall be the final decision of the Secretary ofLabor, and no further review by any DOL official shall be given to it.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter II_Special Items </ITAG>A. Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWRs) This is the hourly wage rate which normally must be offered and paid, asa minimum, to every worker (domestic and alien) for work performed in conjunctionwith an H-2A application and certification. It is designed to prevent thepresence of aliens from adversely affecting the wages of U.S. workers similarlyemployed. AEWRs are established for every State, except Alaska, and are publishedannually in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>in the form of a notice signed by the Director,U.S. Employment Service (USES). The AEWRs correspond to survey findingsmade by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which each year publishesan annual weighted average hourly wage rate for field and livestock workers(combined) for the nineteen USDA regions in which quarterly wage surveysare conducted. The AEWRs are usually published in March or April, and becomeeffective immediately upon publication. Certified H-2A employers must agree, as a condition for receiving certification,to pay a higher AEWR than the one in effect at the time an applicationis submitted in the event publication of the annual AEWR coincides withthe period of employment covered by an H-2A certification; i.e., where,during the season, the AEWR increases, work performed on or after the dateof increase must be compensated at the new AEWR. There are two current, practical situations where an AEWR would not bethe hourly minimum guarantee which is required: andbullet; When a State agency conducts a prevailing wage survey and theresults of the survey show a higher prevailing hourly wage rate in thearea and the occupation, and the finding is verified in writing by theNational Office, the higher prevailing hourly wage is required; and andbullet; Sheepherder and custom combine crew occupations (which involvepayment on a monthly basis) are governed by prevailing wage surveys conductedby State agencies which are verified annually by the National Office andtransmitted to the Regional Offices. The H-2A regulations also permit the Director, USES, to establish specialAEWRs for other types of occupations under the ``special circumstances''provisions of 20 CFR 655.93(b). SESA's and Regional Offices will be informedwhen any special AEWRs are established. At present, no computed AEWRs are below the legal FLSA minimum wage. Inthe event the Federal minimum wage rate should be raised to a level abovethat of any AEWR, the higher FLSA minimum will be required by the provisionsat 20 CFR 655.107(c).When workers are paid on a piece rate basis, the worker's average hourlyprice rate earnings for each pay period must equal or exceed the AEWR (orprevailing hourly rate as determined by a SESA survey and verified by theNational Office, if applicable). If the earnings for piece rate hours workedfall below this level, the worker's pay must be supplemented to raise theearnings to the AEWR level. If, over a normal pay period, workers performa combination of tasks which involve payment on both an hourly and piecerate basis, workers must be paid at least the AEWR for <T3>every </T3>hour worked on an hourly pay basis, and the ``averaging''principle does not apply to those hours worked. B. Prevailing Wage Surveys SESAs should conduct prevailing wage surveys in accordance with the procedurespresented in ET Handbook No. 385, P.I-111 through 143. These surveys areneeded in order to comply with the regulations governing agricultural clearanceorders at 20 CFR Part 653, Subpart F. Generally, surveys should be madeonce per season in a crop activity where: andbullet; One hundred or more workers were employed during the previousseason and may be expected to be employed in the future; andbullet; Temporary alien workers were employed or requested in the previousseason, and there is reason to believe H-2A certification will be soughtfor the coming season; or andbullet; The crop activity has an unusually complex wage structure or thereare other factors which argue for the collection of empirical data in orderto arrive at an objective determination on acceptable wages. Because of IRCA and the potential for an influx of ``new'' employers seekingH-2A workers, SESAs may be faced with the task of having to provide RegionalOffices with advice on the acceptability of other than hourly wage rateswithout the time and opportunity to conduct surveys according to ET HandbookNo. 385 procedures. In such cases, Regional Offices and SESAs will haveto base their determinations on the best information available which canbe gathered during the time available. Normally, the best sources for information to use in arriving at a decisionare open and closed local job orders involving the same or similar occupation,activity, and crop. Telephone requests for information from employers whodo not use the Employment Service also are recommended, as are consultationswith Cooperative Extension Service staff, colleges and universities withstaff conversant in the agricultural sciences, farmworker organizations(including JTPA 404 grantees) and agricultural employer organizations,such as the Farm Bureau. SESAs must also consider whatever documentationthe H-2A employer has to submit. C. Prevailing Practice and Related Determinations In determining the acceptability of wages, benefits, and working conditionson an employer's H-2A application, the following three basic standardsapply: andbullet; The level of benefits being offered to U.S. workers must be noless than the same benefits the employer is offering, intends to offer,or will provide H-2A workers (and <T3>vice versa</T3>). Also, no offer may impose on U.S. workers any restrictionsor obligations not imposed on H-2A workers; andbullet; The minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions must be noless than those required by the regulations at 20 CFR 655.102-103 and 20CFR Part 653, Subpart F; and andbullet; For certain job elements, the employer must offer or must conformthe job offer to conditions and standards which are ``prevailing'', ``normal'',or ``common'' practices or standards of other employers who hire U.S. workersin the same area and in the same occupation. In order to arrive at determinations as to whether certain factors are``prevailing'', SESAs are encouraged to conduct formal surveys of employers,as time and resources permit, utilizing the sample size and data collection/analysisprinciples required for prevailing wage surveys in ET Handbook No. 385,with survey findings and determinations verified by the Regional Office.If a formal survey is not possible in view of time or budgetary constraints,SESAs must, to the extent that they are available: (1) Utilize expert staffknowledge and experience available in the State agency; (2) informallysurvey local employers; (3) contact organizations such as the CooperativeExtension Service and the Farm Bureau; and (4) consult with farmworkeradvocates and other informed sources in order to arrive at a reasonabledetermination of prevailing, common or normal practice. The criteria thatmust be followed in determining that a practice (or other program component)is, in fact, <T3>prevailing, </T3>is as follows: andbullet; A majority of employers of U.S. workers in an area (and for anoccupation) engage in the practice (or offer the benefit); <T3>and </T3>andbullet; This majority of employers (including both criteria and non-criteriaemployers for family housing and frequency of payment determinations, butnon-criteria employers <T3>only </T3>for advance transportation and crewleader utilization determinations)also employs a majority of U.S. workers in the occupation in the area.SESAs must submit their findings in writing to the Regional Office in accordancewith timetables established by the RA for this purpose.If a SESA fails to arrive at a prevailing practice determination on a timelybasis, or the Regional Office has reason to question the validity of theSESA's finding, the Regional Office is responsible for arriving at a thresholddetermination or revising the SESA determination. In so doing, the RegionalOffice should informally survey other informed sources in the same mannernoted above for SESA informal surveys, except that the Regional Officeis precluded from conducting surveys of 10 or more non-Federal sourcesbecause of Federal data collection and reporting constraints. This ``prevailing'' standard and measurement must be used for determinationsconcerning family housing, transportation advances, frequency of payment,and utilization of farm labor contractors. For some job components a standard somewhat less than the ``prevailingpractice'' standard applies. Certain requirements are measured by the degreeto which they are ``normal'' or ``common'', rather than ``prevailing''.The terms ``normal'' and ``common'', although difficult to quantify, forH-2A certification purposes mean situations which may be less than prevailing,but which clearly are not unusual or rare. The degree to which a practiceis engaged in (or a benefit is provided) should be determined to be closeto what is viewed (and measured) as ``prevailing'' but the degree by whichthe practice or benefit is measured and degree of proof needed to establishits acceptability for H-2A purposes is not as formal or stringent as ``prevailing''calls for. The specific requirements for ``prevailing'' determinations, i.e., a majorityof employers who also employ a majority of U.S. workers, do not apply todeterminations concerning provision of tools, productivity standards, positiverecruitment practices, crewleader override, and occupational qualifications.Although formal SESA surveys are desirable in order to determine the extentof normal or common practice related to these factors, the fact that thestandard of measurement is less than the ``prevailing'' standard meansthat the Regional Office will be required to exercise its discretion toa greater degree in applying and evaluating these factors on a reasonablebasis. The following discusses job elements where the ``prevailing'', ``normal'',or ``common'' practice principles must be applied and where the RegionalOffice must make a threshold determination on each element before an employer'sapplication can be accepted: <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Family Housing </ITAG>When it is the prevailing practice of employers of U.S. workers in thearea of employment and occupation to provide family housing, H-2A employersmust provide family housing to workers with families who request that suchhousing be provided. In arriving at a determination as to whether the provisionof family housing is a prevailing practice, RAs and SESAs must look beyondthe threshold question on the basic availability of housing which is suitablefor families. They must also determine whether it is the active practiceof employers to offer this housing as a benefit to migrant workers whoneed and request it. If the RA determines: andbullet; That a majority of employers of U.S. workers (including both criteriaand non-criteria employers) in an area do offer some family housing; andandbullet; That this majority of employers also employs a majority of theU.S. workers in the occupation in the area;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">then H-2A employers who provide housing for singles must also providesome family housing as a benefit in their job offers as being availablefor workers with families who request it. In such cases RAs should require that each H-2A employer provide some familyhousing, but should be reasonable in prescribing the number of such unitsand time frames for the provision of the housing, taking into account theavailability of family housing with other employers in the area and thelikelihood of U.S. workers with families being available for the jobs.For example, it would be reasonable to require employers who have housingsuitable for families which is readily convertible at minimal expense todo so in fairly speedy fashion, but it would not be reasonable to expectemployers to erect or purchase new housing unless there was sufficientlead time involved. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Provision of Tools, Supplies, and Equipment </ITAG>Normally, employers must provide, without charge, all tools, supplies,and equipment to the workers, if they are required to perform the tasksdescribed in the job offer. However, if employers can demonstrate to theRA's satisfaction that it is the common practice in a particular area,crop activity, and occupation for workers to provide their own tools, supplies,and equipment, such an arrangement is permissible, if approved in advanceby the RA. The employer must request the RA's approval for such an arrangement,and the burden of proof for convincing the RA that such a practice is,in fact, common is on the employer. Absent a specific, justifiable, approvedrequest from an employer, the RA must require that employers provide necessarytools, supplies and equipment without charge to the worker.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Transportation Advances </ITAG>H-2A employers must offer to advance transportation and subsistence costs(or otherwise provide them) to U.S. workers when it is the prevailing practiceof non-H-2A employers in the area and occupation to do so (or when transportationis advanced for H-2A workers). In order to determine whether such a requirement should be placed on H-2Aemployers, the RA must make a prevailing practice determination utilizingthe techniques and principles discussed at the beginning of the section.In order for the RA to require advance transportation, the RA must findthat a majority of the non-H-2A employers in the area and occupation engagein this practice, <T3>and </T3>this majority also employ a majority of the domestic workersin an area and occupation. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Productivity Standards </ITAG>When employers pay by piece rate, they commonly establish minimum productivitystandards; e.g., certain minimum levels of production which a worker mustachieve in order to retain employment. For employers who have utilizedthe H-2 program in the past, such standards cannot be more than those whichwere in place in 1977 (or first year thereafter in which the employer enteredthe H-2 program), unless the Regional Office subsequently approved a higherminimum. For ``new'' H-2A employers, such standards cannot be more thanthose normally required in the activity (such as apple picking) in thearea of intended employment. ``New'' H-2A employers who specify minimum productivity requirements intheir job orders must be able to demonstrate to the RA's satisfaction thatthese requirements are no more than those normally required by other employersof U.S. workers in the area. In determining the acceptability of minimum productivity requirements,Regional Offices may ask the employer for the names of other employerswho can verify the adequacy of the employer's requirement. Regional Officestaff may also wish to consult with Cooperative Extension Service or collegeor university personnel with expertise in agricultural sciences for adviceand assistance in arriving at a determination. If time and resources permit, it is recommended that SESA prevailing wagesurveys be minimally modified to include information on productivity requirementsin order to assist the Regional Office in making a threshold determinationfor new H-2A employers. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Frequency of Payment </ITAG>Employers are required to pay their workers at least twice monthly, ormore frequently if it is the prevailing practice of other employers (bothcriteria and non-criteria) of U.S. workers in the area of intended employmentto do so. A prevailing practice determination on this job element mustbe made in the manner discussed at the beginning of this section. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Employer Positive Recruitment of U.S. Workers (Including Use ofCrewleaders and Crewleader Overrides) </ITAG>The degree to which an H-2A employer is required to engage in independent,positive recruitment is partly measured by the extent to which non-H-2Aagricultural employers of comparable or smaller size in the area engagein U.S. worker recruitment, with respect to both effort and location. For example, if it is normal for employers of U.S. workers in the areato contract with an agent in a distant labor supply State to have the agentvisit locations of migrant workers and aggressively recruit them, the H-2Aemployer would be required to do the same, provided that the non-H-2A employersare not ``larger'' than the H-2A employer in terms of acreage, crop production,or number of workers normally employed.Conversely, if similarly sized non-H-2A employers simply rely on ``word-of-mouth''advertising or a ``HELP WANTED'' sign on the gate, the H-2A employer wouldnot be expected to do any more (unless specifically required to by theRA based on the RA finding of U.S. worker availability). Another factor which has to be considered in determining positive recruitmentrequirements is the extent to which non-H-2A employers utilize farm laborcontractors (crewleaders) to secure U.S. workers. If a majority of non-H-2Aemployers in an area (who employ a majority of the U.S. workers in thearea) use crewleaders, and provide an override (payment usually based ona per worker or per unit of production basis) for the crewleader's services,H-2A employers must be willing to do the same and must provide an overridewhich is no less than that provided by other employers (except that mealsand housing may be excluded from override considerations). In determining the normal recruitment practices of non-H-2A employers,SESAs are required to conduct surveys of employers, as time and resourcespermit. In the event this cannot be accomplished by the SESA on a timelybasis, the Regional Office must make the determination based on its ownassessment. The prevailing practice principle applies to the examination of crewleaderutilization (but not override), and the RA's determination must be basedon the measurement standard discussed above. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Appropriateness of Required Occupational Qualifications </ITAG>Employers may require potential workers to possess certain qualificationsdeemed necessary to successfully perform the job duties specified in thejob order for which H-2A certification is being sought. Regional Officesshould review job offers where such qualifications are required on a case-by-casebasis, and relate them to the actual work situation involved. The statute and the regulations require that such qualifications be consistentwith those normally found to be necessary by non-H-2A employers in thesame or comparable occupations and crops. Most occupations for which H-2Acertification is sought are low skilled in nature, and normally would notrequire much, if anything, in the way of special skills, training, or experienceon the part of the workers. Where special skills, training, or experienceare identified as requirements in a job order, the Regional Office mustreview them for their appropriateness. In determining the appropriateness of occupational qualifications, theRegional Office should consider normal, accepted practice of non-H-2A employersin the same or comparable occupations and crops as a first step. Reviewsof open and closed job orders in local offices and consultations with otheremployers are recommended for this purpose. Reference to available sourcesof occupational information, such as the <T3>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </T3>and its supplements, also arerecommended, as are consultations with representatives of the CooperativeExtension Service, educators with agricultural expertise, and farmworkeradvocates and other informed sources. In the event the non-acceptance of an employer's required occupationalqualification is contested by an employer on an informal basis before anH-2A application is officially rejected by a Regional Office, the employershould be advised to submit documentation sufficient to support a findingthat the requirement is appropriate because it is consistent with normaland accepted qualifications required by non-H-2A employers in the sameor comparable occupations and crops. The non-acceptability of a required occupational qualification on a joborder is sufficient justification for refusing to accept an employer'sH-2A application, and the burden of proof for justifying the acceptabilityof an occupational qualification which is questioned by the Regional Officerests with the employer.D. Housing Inspections and Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Requirements </ITAG>Employers seeking H-2A certification must have free housing for non-localworkers. The housing must meet the OSHA standards specified in the regulationsat 29 CFR 1910.142 or, under certain conditions, the ETA standards at 20CFR 654, unless the employer is providing rental or public accommodationtype housing. In this case, local or State standards will apply. Absentlocal or State standards, the OSHA standards are applicable, and pre-occupancyhousing inspections must be conducted. If DOL standards are not applicable,no pre-occupancy inspections need be conducted, and the employer need onlydocument to the RA's satisfaction that the housing complies with the localor State standards which apply to the situation. (Employers also may besubject to additional housing requirements under MSPA.) Mobile range housing for sheepherders is governed by the special proceduresin FM andplusmin;108-82, and mobile housing provided by Canadian custom combineowners is handled differently. The SESA is responsible for assuring, through a pre-occupancy inspection,that housing which is governed by OSHA or ETA standards is inspected priorto occupancy, and that the housing meets DOL standards for safety and adequacy.In States where either local or State standards for housing of agriculturalworkers equal or exceed those at 20 CFR 654 or 29 CFR 1910.142 and arestrictly enforced, a formal written cooperative agreement may be securedwith another governmental agency to do the necessary housing inspections.Although the SESA may not do the actual inspections, the SESA must makethe determination required by the regulations at 20 CFR 653.501(d)(2)(xv)before extending agricultural orders into clearance (except under conditionalaccess situations). It is recommended that SESAs complete and attach optionalForm ETA 338 to clearance orders to clearly show that the housing has beeninspected and meets standards. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Conditional Access </ITAG>The pre-clearance inspection may be delayed if the employer requests conditionalaccess to the clearance system because the housing is not in compliancewhen the employer files the H-2A application package. The regulations requirethat this conditional access request contain an assurance that the housingwill be available for inspection and will meet DOL requirements at leastthirty days before the date of need. RAs should normally grant <T3>pro forma </T3>approval to such requests so the clearance process willnot be delayed, and should only question them when there is available evidencethat substantial problems exist which indicate strongly that the housingwill not be approvable within the time frames noted. The local office serving the area of an employer granted conditional accessshall assure that the housing is inspected no later than thirty calendardays before the employer's stated date of need. If the housing fails topass inspection, the employer shall be given an additional five calendardays to correct deficiencies noted by SESA staff. If the housing does notmeet applicable standards upon reinspection no more than five days later,the local office must immediately notify the RA by telephone. After SESAconsultation with the RA, the employer's job order shall be immediatelyremoved from clearance, and, if workers were recruited against the order,the local office shall cooperate with SESAs in other States to locate andnotify appropriate workers or crewleaders and to attempt to find alternativecomparable employment for them. The RA may not grant a certification toan employer whose housing has not passed inspection.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. OSHA and ETA Standards </ITAG>With the exception of rental, public accommodation, mobile combine crew,or sheepherder housing, H-2A employer housing would be expected to complywith OSHA standards set forth at 29 CFR 1910.142, except that ETA standardsat 20 CFR 654 apply to: andbullet; Housing built before April 3, 1980, relying upon ETA standards;or andbullet; Housing being constructed before April 3, 1980, relying upon ETAstandards; or andbullet; Housing for which a contract for construction was signed beforeMarch 4, 1980, relying upon ETA standards. Employers with more than one housing site may have their housing inspectedwith either the full set of standards at 20 CFR 654 or 29 CFR 1910.142,whichever applies to each clearly identifiable separate housing site.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Variances and De Minimus Notices </ITAG>The ETA and OSHA standards provide for deviations from particular requirementswhere there is no direct or immediate threat to occupants' safety or health.Under ETA standards, such deviations are authorized only if the employerapplied on or before June 2, 1980, for a permanent structural varianceand received written authorization from the RA for ETA to vary from specifiedETA standards. Under the OSHA standards, such deviations are noted by fieldinspectors as <T3>de minimus </T3>violations under section 9(a) of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act. a. <T3>ETA Variances (20 CFR 654.402). </T3>All housing inspected under theregulations at 20 CFR Part 654 must literally meet the full set of ETAstandards except when the RA for ETA, consulting with the RA for OSHA,granted a permanent structural variance from a specified standard; underthat condition, the housing must meet the terms of the variance. The deadlinefor permanent variance applications was June 2, 1980. b. <T3>OSHA De Minimus Notices (29 CFR 1910.142). </T3>OSHA regards ETA variancesgranted under 20 CFR 654.402 as meeting the <T3>de minimus </T3>provisions of section 9(a) of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act. Minor variations from specific dimensions or ratios of the OSHA standardwhich, in the judgment of the inspector, will not have a direct or immediaterelationship to safety or health of the occupants will be considered <T3>de minimus </T3>according to section 9(a) of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act. If the inspector believes that variations from specific dimensions or ratiosmay have a direct effect on safety and health, the inspector may consultwith OSHA to determine if the variation is considered <T3>de minimus </T3>under section 9(a) of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct. The inspector must send a written request to the OSHA Area Directorclearly specifying the standard involved, the extent of the variation,and any alternate measures which the employer took to protect the healthand safety of workers. One copy each of the request to the Area Director must be sent immediatelyto the RAs for ETA and OSHA. The OSHA Area Director will review the requestto determine if the variation is considered <T3>de minimus </T3>under section 9(a) of the Occupational Safety and HealthAct. The Area Director, after reviewing the request, will advise the local ESoffice in writing whether or not the variation is considered <T3>de minimus </T3>according to section 9(a) of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act. One copy each of the Area Director's response must be sentimmediately to the RAs for ETA and OSHA. Only when housing varies so substantially from an OSHA standard that itcannot be considered a <T3>de minimus </T3>violation would an employer seek a formal OSHA varianceunder the elaborate procedures of section 6 of the Occupational Safetyand Health Act. According to OSHA variance procedures, affected employeesmust be given notice and opportunity for a hearing before issuing a variancefrom OSHA standards. Should the employer elect to seek a variance under Section 6 (d) it isimportant to note that it will be necessary that the alternative method,system, or procedure be as safe and healthful as the requirements of thestandard from which a variance is sought. ETA and SESA staff should refer employers to the OSHA Area Director forinformation and assistance in filing a formal request for variance undersection 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act if employers inquireabout such matters. E. Determining Labor Disputes When filing an H-2A application, the employer must assure that the specificjob opportunity for which certification is being requested is not vacantbecause the former occupant is on strike or being locked out in the courseof a labor dispute. Further, when the RA makes a certification determination,the RA must subtract from any otherwise approvable request the specificverified number of job opportunities involved which are vacant becauseof a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage or a lockoutin the specific occupation at the place of employment when H-2A workershave been requested for those job opportunities. Before taking such an action, the RA must verify the existence of a strike,labor dispute, or lockout, and the actual number of vacancies directlyattributable thereto through the means of a SESA onsite investigation ofthe situation and a written report of the findings of that investigation.The regulations provide that the RA must initiate an investigation uponthe receipt of labor dispute information from any source. When such informationis received in the Regional Office, the Regional Office should promptlyinform the SESA that an onsite review and assessment of the situation shouldbe conducted within five working days. The RA should consult with the SESAto develop mutually agreed upon steps to be taken in conducting the investigation.Such procedures should require SESA staff to: andbullet; Visit the employer's worksite; andbullet; Interview the employer or the employer's designated representative(s);andbullet; Interview the workers who have allegedly vacated the positionsinvolved; and andbullet; Interview the workers' designated representative(s) or union official(s)involved, if any. These interviews should be designed to elicit the following informationitems (at a minimum), as well as any other information deemed appropriateby the Regional Office and the SESA: andbullet; Name, address, phone number, and Social Security number of complainingemployee; andbullet; Length of time complaining employee has spent on the job whichis the subject of the dispute; andbullet; Use made of employer's grievance procedure, if any; andbullet; Factual determination of whether a position which has been occupiedis now vacant for reasons related to the dispute, and the number of suchpositions; and andbullet; Specific conditions complained about with any evidence to supportthe complaint. Within two days after the investigation has been completed, the SESA shouldprepare a report of its findings and send it to the Regional Office. Basedon the SESA report, and any subsequent additional investigation the RegionalOffice may wish to conduct, the RA should make a determination as to whethera position for which H-2A certification determination (or certificationredetermination) is sought is, in fact, vacant (after having been occupied)due to a strike, lockout, or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage.Prior to making this determination, the RA should consult by telephonewith the National Office for concurrence. When a positive determination has been made, the RA should then preparea memorandum for the file indicating that a finding has been made and thatthe specific positions vacant because of the dispute will not be includedin any otherwise positive H-2A certification determination or redetermination,and giving the reasons therefor. When the situation involves a redeterminationmatter, the RA's finding should also be transmitted to the appropriateINS District Office responsible for adjudicating employers' petitions forH-2A visas. The role of the SESA in referring applicants to job orders when there isa dispute involved is governed by the regulations at 20 CFR 652.9, Establishmentand Functioning of State Employment Services.F. Farm Labor Contractors (Crewleaders) as Employers The H-2A program and the implementing regulations are primarily constructedfor the use of employers who own and/or operate a fixed-site establishmentand who are seeking workers from out of the area to come to that fixedsite. However, there is nothing in the statute or the regulations to precludean employer who does not fit into this category from utilizing the program.Therefore, bona fide registered farm labor contractors may be eligibleto apply for and receive H-2A certification. Given the extent of the employer's responsibility under these regulations,it is doubtful that many farm labor contractors would apply for certification.Farm labor contractors would be required, as employers, to provide allthe minimum benefits specified by the H-2A regulations, including the three-fourthsguarantee and the offer of employment to U.S. workers who apply until fiftypercent of the contract period has elapsed. In order for a crewleader to be eligible for H-2A purposes, the crewleadermust first meet all the requirements of the definition of ``employer''set forth in the regulations at 20 CFR 655.100(b). It must be clear thata contractor will have an employer-employee relationship with the workers,and that the contractor will be responsible for hiring, paying, firing,supervising, or otherwise controlling the work of the employees. It wouldbe advisable to determine, for example, if a contractor deducts FederalInsurance Contribution Act (FICA) withholdings, provides matching contributions,and transmits such to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under its ownaccount number. A farm labor contractor seeking H-2A certification must comply with allthe other requirements of the regulations at 20 CFR Part 653 and 20 CFRPart 655, including the requirements that there be a precise anticipatedstarting date and ending date of employment, and that the anticipated numberof days and hours per week for which work will be available must be stated.A vague, unconfirmed itinerary is not acceptable for H-2A filing purposes.SESA and Regional Office staff should be careful to look behind any applicationsfiled by farm labor contractors to ensure that the contractor is operatingin accordance with MSPA requirements, and that the job opportunities forwhich workers are being sought are bona fide, and all the conditions associatedwith them comply with applicable laws and regulations. Consultations withESA and with known fixed-site growers in the area of intended employmentare recommended for this purpose. G. Determining Legal Employment Status of Workers Referred Under the provisions of IRCA, an employer is exempt from sanctions relatedto the hiring of an alien who is not authorized to work in the U.S. ``.. . with respect to the hiring of an individual who was referred for suchemployment by a State employment agency . . . if the person or entity (employer)has or retains . . . appropriate documentation of such referral by thatagency, which documentation certifies that the agency has complied withthe procedures specified in (the Act) . . . with respect to the individual'sreferral''. The participation of the SESAs in this employment verification and referralfunction is a permissible activity for SESAs to undertake, at their option,under their base Wagner-Peyser grant. Specific instructions governing theSESA role when a State wishes to participate are contained in INS regulationsat 8 CFR Part 274a, Subpart A 274.6., November 9, 1987. It is permissible for employers to specify on job orders that workers referredmust possess the documentation required to enable the employer to complywith the employment verification requirements of IRCA. It is also permissiblefor employers to request that SESA's referring U.S. workers on job ordersperform the employment verification function, and SESA's which have exercisedthe option of participating in the activity should do so. However, it isnot permissible for employers to specify on job orders that the SESA makingreferral <T3>must </T3>perform the function. For H-2A certification purposes, if a referred worker is unable to producethe documents needed for an employer to comply with the employment verificationrequirements of the INS regulations, the employer would have a lawful job-relatedreason for not hiring the worker. Referred workers refused employment forthis reason should not be counted as available for certification purposes.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Appendices ommitted)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-13165 Filed 6-10-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-30-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
