No pickup</NOTE><DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A small West German plane crossed theNorwegian border into Soviet air space a year after the dramaticflight by Mathias Rust to Moscow's Red Square, a Foreign Ministryspokesman said today.   Spokesman Lasse Seim said the Cessna 150 was on its way fromIvalo in northern Finland to Kirkenes in the northeast corner ofNorway on Saturday when the pilot strayed over Soviet territory.   The plane crossed deeper into Soviet air space when it returnedto Ivalo on Sunday, Seim said. He said the aircraft penetrated``several miles'' over Soviet territory, and may have violatedSoviet airspace for 20 or 30 minutes.   Norwegian government sources and the West German Embassyidentified the pilot as Andreas Sommer of Hamburg. No furtherinformation on him was immediately available.   In Helsinki, Matti Autio, spokesman for the Finnish BorderPatrol, said Sommer was questioned and released, and left Finlandtoday, apparently for Sweden.   Another Border Patrol official, reached by telephone at thenorthern base of Rovaniemi, said Sommer claimed he lost his way dueto bad weather. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,confirmed it was cloudy in the area during the weekend.   A Soviet Embassy spokesman was quoted on Swedish radio ascalling the incident ``a stupid practical joke'' rather than aprovocation.   ``No one wants to blow up this case,'' Seim said.   Seim said Norway contacted Soviet authorities on Sunday, and``we have the impression that they followed the plane. They knewabout it.''   The Aftenposten newspaper speculated that the Soviet may haverefrained from shooting at the plane because of the superpowersummit in Moscow.   Seim said the Soviet Border Commission asked for a meeting withthe Norwegians on Monday, when they handed over a formal protest.   Asked if Saturday's flight was timed to the anniversary ofRust's flight, Seim said, ``We don't know. But it seems likely,doesn't it?''   Rust, also of Hamburg, flew a similar Cessna to Moscow fromHelsinki, Finland, on May 28, 1987, landing outside the Kremlin'swalls. He is serving a five-year prison term in the Soviet Union.   Rust was 19 at the time he made the flight. On Sept. 4, 1987, hewas found guilty by a Moscow court of illegal entry into the SovietUnion, violating international flight regulations and malicioushooliganism. He was sentenced to four years in a labor camp, but iscurrently being held in a Moscow prison.   Rust's flight embarrassed the Soviet air defenses, which failedto stop him, and prompted a shake-up in the Soviet military.</TEXT></DOC>
