The Middle East Economic Survey said Monday that Aramco willprobably be called Saudi National Oil Co.-Aramco.   Aramco is the largest oil-producing company in the non-communistworld. It is currently incorporated in Delaware.   The restructured company will be ``the vehicle for the kingdom'sdrive to establish a substantial presence in the downstream(refining and marketing) industry overseas by means of jointventures with the former Aramco parents as well as with others,''editor Ian Seymour wrote in the authoritative newsletter.   He said the new Aramco will retain its technical and managerialassistance contracts with the four former Aramco parents _ ExxonCorp., Mobil Corp., Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corp. _ but notnecessarily with the same contracts or the same terms.   There could also be scope for similar assistance agreements withother companies, Seymour said.   He mentioned press reports of a deal under which Saudi Arabiawould acquire 50 percent of Texaco's major refining amd marketingassets.   The effort to establish joint ventures in refining and marketingin oil-consuming countries is designed to counter oil priceinstability by ``providing secure outlets for Saudi crude, securesupplies for the non-Saudi partners and good profits for bothparties,'' Seymour wrote.   ``The presence of a foreign partner to provide local know-how inthe market concerned is regarded as an absolute prerequisite forthe Saudi newcomer,'' he said. ``The objective is to have anintegrated national oil company controlled, managed and operated bySaudis.''   For years Aramco, founded in 1933, controlled the production andsale of Saudi crude oil, paying royalties to the Saudi government.   In 1973 Saudi Arabia bought a 25 percent share in Aramco and ayear later raised its stake to 60 percent. In 1980 it acquired fullcontrol.   As recently as 1986, Aramco still had nearly 4,000 U.S.employees, including many top executives.   This year Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer was appointed chairmanand another Saudi, Ali Naimi, president since 1984, was named chiefexecutive.   Seymour said the charter for the restructured Aramco was beingdiscussed by a ministerial committee set up by Saudi King Fahd.   Aramco now produces around 4 million barrels of Saudi oil a day.It refines 450,000 barrels a day at Ras Tanura on Saudi Arabia'sGulf coast. A barrel is the equivalent of 42 gallons.   The company markets crude through its offices at Dhahran, SaudiArabia, and through an international affiliate with offices in NewYork, Houston and Tokyo.</TEXT></DOC>
