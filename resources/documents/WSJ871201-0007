The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded 76.93, its eighth largest point loss ever, to close at 1833.55 after being down more than 100 points in the early afternoon. Traders' fears of another market crash were eased by a mild rebound late in the day, but many analysts concluded that the market was again especially vulnerable to disappointments on the economic and political fronts.    Meanwhile, prices of Treasury bills and bonds generally firmed as investors sought the safety of government-backed securities.    The 4% drop in the industrial average began abruptly, with the average off more than 50 points by 9:50 a.m. EST, only 20 minutes after the opening. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 268.9 million shares, the highest since Oct. 30, though still less than half the record 608.1 million shares traded Oct. 20. A total of 1,576 issues fell in price, and only 201 advanced.    &quot;The selling seems to be coming from all over,&quot; John Groveman, head equity trader at Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co. in New York, said.    In currency trading, the dollar reached a record low of 1.6315 West German marks and a postwar low of 131.98 Japanese yen in intraday trading before ending the New York session slightly above those levels.    As stocks fell yesterday, traders and investors fretted that U.S. economic policy was veering off course.    &quot;There's a tremendous sense of drift,&quot; Ronald Machold, investment chief of the $23 billion New Jersey pension plan, said. &quot;We aren't getting much in terms of reducing the budget deficit. There isn't a clear policy on the dollar. And there's still fear of inflation.&quot;    Market professionals overseas registered similar complaints. &quot;When foreigners are asked to finance a huge (U.S.) current account deficit and the country involved doesn't seem to care about its exchange rate . . . then you have the potential for disorderly markets,&quot; Jonathan Wilmot, senior economist of CSFB Securities in London, said.    The dollar has fallen more than 50% against the yen and mark since early 1985, but the U.S. currency appeared to be bottoming out earlier this year. Since the October stock market crash, however, the dollar has sunk an average of about 7% against major currencies.    The dollar's latest decline reflects some new anxieties as well as older worries about the big U.S. trade deficit. Robert H. Chandross, chief economist for Lloyds Bank PLC, said the meager progress so far in narrowing the federal budget deficit is &quot;unnerving&quot; to foreign exchange traders. He also faulted &quot;conflicting comments&quot; about the prospects of a top-level meeting to coordinate major industrial nations' economic policies.    When stocks were riding high this summer, a weaker dollar was seen as helpful to the U.S. economy and stock market. Export-oriented companies in particular were expected to benefit from a cheaper dollar that would help them compete against foreign rivals. But with foreign investors grumbling about the dollar's long decline, analysts are changing their thinking.    &quot;If the dollar were to decline precipitously, all bets are off about financial judgments of where stocks and bonds should be,&quot; says Robert Brusca, chief economist for the U.S. unit of Nikko Securities Co.    Yesterday's rout hit the stock market broadside, affecting the over-the-counter market as well as the Big Board. The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.31, to 305.16, a 3.6% decline.    Among blue-chip issues, International Business Machines Corp. fell $4.125 a share to $110.75, and Merck andamp; Co. was off $5.50 a share, to $170.    Stocks pared their losses slightly in the final hour yesterday, but Thomas Gallagher, head of institutional equity trading at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said: &quot;It wasn't much of a bounce-back. The buy orders didn't pour in and there wasn't much of an expansion&quot; in the number of issues advancing in the session, he said.    Mr. Gallagher said he doesn't expect investors to rush to buy stocks any day soon. He expects the market will reach a point at which investors become &quot;despondent about declines day after day&quot; and portfolio managers &quot;just throw away stocks&quot; because they &quot;can no longer stand the pain.&quot;    &quot;That's how a bear market works,&quot; the 43-year-old Mr. Gallagher said. &quot;Stocks go down day after day and you have some occasional rallies. But looking at the young faces of the men and women taking clients' calls in front of him, he added: &quot;Most of these people are experiencing it for the first time.&quot;    At mutual funds, meanwhile, managers said relatively few investors cashed out as yesterday's stock market drop unfolded. &quot;People have gotten kind of desensitized to this kind of volatility,&quot; said Steven Norwitz, a vice president at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. &quot;It's got to be more than 100 points to move these investors.&quot;    Still, one recently successful mutual fund manager, Milton Berg of Oppenheimer Management Co., admitted he was &quot;very nervous.&quot; Mr. Berg sidestepped the market rout in October, but became fully invested afterward, believing stocks would rally. &quot;On an intellectual basis, (yesterday's action) looks like a classic bottoming&quot; of the stock market, he said. &quot;But on an emotional basis, it's killing me.&quot;    In Kauai, Hawaii, the market drop cast a shadow on a weeklong seminar sponsored by the American Association of Individual Investors. &quot;We're still sucking mud in the U.S. market,&quot; said Warren Martin, a La Canada, Calif., engineer and attorney. &quot;When you take into consideration what's happened since the crash and add on this decline, it causes me a lot of concern.&quot;    At the New York Stock Exchange, a spokesman said the Big Board didn't encounter any operational problems yesterday, or problems with the capital adequacy of &quot;specialists,&quot; as market-makers are known. The Big Board has been more closely monitoring the capital of specialist firms since the Oct. 19 market crash.    In Chicago, futures contracts on Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index frequently traded yesterday at a discount to the underlying stocks. That prompted some traders to buy futures and sell stocks, sending stock prices even lower. But traders said the futures market was relatively orderly, with prices inching along in 1/20 of a point increments, instead of the big half-point jumps common in October.    At the stock market's nadir early in the afternoon, buyers all but disappeared from the Sandamp;P 500 futures pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, traders said.    A harbinger of a potential rally today, at least initially, was that the Sandamp;P 500 December futures contract closed yesterday at a premium of 1.69 points to the cash index, or more than three times its theoretical value. That premium may prompt arbitrage traders to sell the relatively overpriced futures and buy the stocks, fueling a rally in the stock market. But overnight developments, such as a falling dollar, could quickly erase that premium at today's start of trading, traders cautioned.    Absent any major multi-government action, the dollar could fall significantly further against major currencies, traders and economists say. The brokerage firm of James Capel andamp; Co. expects the dollar to sink to 1.57 marks and 123 yen in a year.    Some analysts worry that the Federal Reserve may find itself in a bind: It might have to raise U.S. interest rates at some stage to defend the dollar, and that, in turn, could slow economic growth and further upset the stock market.    Some analysts warned that yesterday's decline could mark the second leg of the crash of 1987. &quot;Earthquakes seldom happen just once; there's usually an aftershock,&quot; said CSFB's Mr. Wilmot. &quot;It's anybody's guess just how far this (stock market) will go down.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Currency's Slide Prompts Efforts to Accelerate Plans for 7-Nation Talks&quot; -- WSJ Dec. 1, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
