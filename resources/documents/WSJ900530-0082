Mr. Walsh's office now reports that it's spent more than$20 million. Despite expectations that he'd take down hisshingle after the John Poindexter trial, Mr. Walsh this monthcalled a new grand jury. He may prosecute more officials forwhat he calls a &quot;pattern of deceit.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Walsh's office begins to look like a permanent agency,but a government office with a difference. Freedom fromaccountability for independent counsels seems to extend tomaking it impossible to find out how much they've reallyspent. I know. I've tried.   Mr. Walsh's reported expenses of $20.8 million do notinclude costs that his prosecutions forced onto othergovernment offices. On request, Attorney General DickThornburgh's staff disclosed nearly $8 million more, shown inthe table &quot;Iran-Contra Costs,&quot; for a total of $28.7 million.The FBI has spent more than $5.4 million helping Mr. Walsh,with security adding nearly another $1 million. Although theJustice figures include $29,000 to track the Walsh budget,officials admit these figures are seriously incomplete.   The White House, Defense, State, CIA, National SecurityCouncil and National Security Agency all have huge unreportedexpenses. So do the courts. In 1987 alone, the White Househad to hire 60 lawyers and archivists to review classifiedmaterial. The Washington newspaper Legal Times more than ayear ago estimated that the total cost of the Iran-Contracases then was $40 million, possibly $100 million. Thissounds about right.   Let's put even the low-ball $28.7 million intoperspective. This dwarfs the $3.8 million allegedly divertedfrom the Iranian arms sales to the Contras. Or the $13,800&quot;illegal gratuity&quot; in the form of the home security fence forOliver North.   And for what? We haven't learned much from the Iran-Contraprosecutions that wasn't disclosed by the presidential TowerCommission and the congressional hearings. Mr. Walsh nevertried to prove that the diversion itself was illegal or thatthe Boland amendments applied to the National SecurityCouncil. Judges so far have decided the crimes warrantednothing more than community service.   Two Contra fund raisers copped tax pleas based on what aJustice official called a &quot;wacko legal theory.&quot; RobertMcFarlane, Mr. North and Mr. Poindexter, respectively,withheld information from Congress, aided and abetted inobstructing Congress and obstructed Congress. MiddlemenAlbert Hakim and Richard Secord pleaded to covering up Mr.North's security fence. Mr. Walsh had to drop the caseagainst former CIA agent Joseph Fernandez, but still pursuesformer CIA official Thomas Clines on tax charges.   No one has looked into any &quot;pattern of deceit&quot; byCongress, but how do offenses by executive-branch officialsfit into law enforcement more generally? ContrastIran-Contra's $28.7 million with the $50 million budget forthe office of New York District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.More than 400 prosecutors last year filed criminal cases inManhattan against more than 120,000 defendants, includingmore than 11,000 alleged felons -- $400 per defandant.   Maybe it's more fair to compare the Walsh prosecution withother federal prosecutors. In pursuing nine formerexecutive-branch officials and their private contractors, Mr.Walsh has spent more than any of the 93 U.S. Attorneys'Offices spent in 1989 (except for Washington, D.C., where thefederal prosecutor has many local functions). The table &quot;CostPer Criminal Defendant&quot; shows the performance of selectedU.S. Attorneys. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattanprosecuted more than 1,400 cases -- including complex WallStreet cases -- with a budget smaller than Mr. Walsh's.   According to a statistical report by the JusticeDepartment, the top two crimes targeted by U.S. Attorneyswere drugs and crimes committed with weapons. No one wouldsay these prosecutions had anything to do with criminalizingthe battle over separation of powers.   Such extraordinary prosecutorial resources devoted to afew defendants raise clear civil liberties issues. &quot;Howfrightening it must be,&quot; Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in hisdissent to the case upholding these prosecutors asconstitutional, &quot;to have your own independent counsel andstaff appointed with nothing else to do but to investigateyou.&quot; The average lawyer in a U.S. Attorney's Office handles117 cases a year, picking them with a discretion thatindependent counsels need not exercise.   Congress created prosecutors who would show no restraintwith executive-branch targets, but this game has gone toofar. With drugs and violent crime tearing at the socialfabric, this is no time to fund political prosecutions.   ---                     Iran-Contra Costs                                                                                                                 A partial tally as of March 31, 1990                       Direct Costs                                                                                                          Expenses reported by Walsh                  $20,774,000                                                                                                                             Indirect Costs                                                                                                          FBI                                           5,459,000   Security staff                                  989,000   IRS                                             894,000   Criminal Division, Justice Dept.                409,000   Facility and Property Management                 76,000   U.S. Customs Service                             49,000   Budget Staff                                     29,000   Information Systems Staff                        20,000   Publications                                     12,000   U.S. Attorneys                                    4,000   Finance Staff                                     3,000                                                                                                          Indirect Costs Total                         $7,932,000                                                                                                          Total, Direct and Indirect Costs            $28,706,000                                                                                                          Source: Justice Department   ---                Cost per Criminal Defendant                                                                                                                              NUMBER OF   TOTAL BUDGET   COST PER                       DEFENDANTS  (In millions)  DEFENDANT                                                                                                        Lawrence Walsh              9         $28.7      $3,190,000                                                                                                        S.
