Television Discovers The Ideal Show for Alistair Cooke </HL><AUTHOR> Dennis Kneale (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GE </CO><IN> TEL </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When you're No. 1 in network television, you can afford to take artistic risks.    And so it is that NBC, the top-rated network that gave us the critically acclaimed programs &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and &quot;The Cosby Show,&quot; will air a drama-comedy on Friday that hasn't graced prime-time network television in 33 years:   Professional wrestling.    &quot;The Main Event&quot; will give an expected 34 million viewers one hour of body slams, groin kicks and various villainous histrionics -- in other words, the stuff of TV wrestling. There will be three championship matches, including, of course, the really big one: Blond and brawny Hulk Hogan, America's &quot;Hulkster,&quot; defending his title against Andre the Giant, a 7-foot-5-inch, 500-pound Frenchman.    The show will air 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. EST on Friday, opposite, fittingly enough, CBS's &quot;Beauty and the Beast.&quot;    All of which poses the Big Question: Who gets the blame for this?    Start with renowned programming genius Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment. And, to be fair to Mr. Tartikoff, throw in Emmy Award-winning producer Dick Ebersol.    &quot;Around Halloween,&quot; Mr. Ebersol says, &quot;Brandon called up one day and asked would I want to do one of these (wrestling programs) in prime time. I never asked him -- he asked me.&quot;    Not that Mr. Ebersol objected. His reasoning: Give the people what they want. A staple of prime-time TV in the 1950s, wrestling had been in the twilight zone of weekend syndication. But NBC in 1985 began airing periodic wrestling &quot;specials&quot; at 11:30 p.m. on Saturdays, holding a headlock on 25 million viewers. Last March's match grabbed the highest rating ever for an NBC special in that time slot.    In days past, Mr. Ebersol produced ABC's &quot;Wide World of Sports,&quot; the Olympics and other &quot;real-sports&quot; programs. Then, with wrestling producer Vince McMahon, he learned wrestling's appeal: life-sized cartoon characters for kids, hysterical satire for some &quot;adults.&quot;    &quot;Half the audience takes the competition totally seriously, and the other half is rolling on the floor with glee,&quot; Mr. Ebersol says.    And yes, Mr. Ebersol hears criticism all the time from &quot;real-sports&quot; producers. His retort: &quot;It's a hell of a lot more fun than the demolition derbies we used to do on 'Wide World of Sports.' And the cars couldn't talk.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
