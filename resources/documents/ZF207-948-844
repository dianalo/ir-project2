(IBM) closed its Indian subsidiaries in1977-78, leaving behind a host of Indian ex-IBMers looking for something todo.andM;According to IBM, it decided to pull out of India because of unreasonablegovernment regulations which mandated 60% domestic ownership of IBM's Indianoperations.andM;However, according to some Indian views, IBM was asked to leave because BigBlue charged too much money, brought in outdated equipment, and was notinterested in negotiating better terms.andM;&quot;We don't feel we've ever left India,&quot; said Tom Belz, progaram administratorat IBM corporate headquarters, during a recent telephone conversation.andP;  &quot;Wecontinue to sell to India and never stopped being interested in this country.andO;We just changed our mode from onshore marketing to offshore marketing.&quot;andM;IBM's departure prompted some major changes which, in turn, greatlyinfluenced the Indian software industry:andM;* Indian professionals trained by IBM started small software houses;andM;* the Computer Maintenance Corp. (CMC) was formed to maintain IBM equipment,software and whatever else came along;andM;* Indian software engineers migrated to the West, mainly to the U.S.;andM;* India aggressively began to look toward America, trying to hook up withU.S.andP;  companies.andM;LEGACY OF IBM: CMCandM;Computer literacy became a national goal in 1978 after IBM announced that itwould cease its maintenance and support operations in India.andP;  In response,CMC was formed and vowed to the horrified Indian computer community--most ofwhich had IBM equipment--to provide maintenance services to all usersregardless of the type, age, size or location of their machines.andM;No doubt, CMC must have had to overcome quite a few hurdles.andP;  Nevertheless,with its staff of ex-IBMers, CMC managed not only to survive and comply withits customers' needs but grew into a profitable company.andM;&quot;There is no other company like CMC,&quot; said Jayanta K. Maitra, general managerof CMC in Calcutta.andP;  &quot;We are perhaps the only company in the world to supportmainframe systems of 34 international manufacturers.andP;  We even maintain theold electronic keypunch systems, the old IBM system 1401 right up to the4361.&quot;andM;Along with hardware maintenance, CMC provides systems consulting services.andO;It also designs and markets utilities and application software.andM;CMC employs nearly 1,700 professionals--cross-trained on multiple systems--totake care of its computer maintenance, software systems, Randamp;D and educationaldivisions.andP;  Today, CMC offices are spread across India, and its revenues areestimated to be around $62 million.andM;CMC is government-owned and its best customers are other government-ownedcompanies.andP;  &quot;We have never had any reason to complain in the last eightyears,&quot; said CMC user S. Jayaraman, who is general manager of systemsengineering and computer services at Engineers India Ltd., New Delhi.andP;  &quot;Wehave an on-call arrangement with CMC, and they respond to our messages withinan hour.&quot;andM;Engineers India Ltd. uses three IBM 4341s, Digital Equipment Corp. VAXs,Univac, Honeywell and Unisys systems, and a staff of over 3,800 people (ofwhich 2,800 are software engineers) to develop engineering and projectmanagement packages.andM;Its computer room is maintained with great care.andP;  People take off their shoesoutside in order to keep the dust out, and, as they enter, the wait in alobby until the door is closed.andP;  This lobby balances the temperature and letsno hot air into the computer room.andM;Regarding the question of whether Engineers India is interested in exportingto the U.S., Jayaraman replied, &quot;I am not sure.andP;  We are a very profitablecompany and have a market here in India that isn't overly saturated.andM;&quot;It takes time to establish credibility in the U.S.andP;  There are highlyeducated Americans who have little or no idea about India aside from the factthat it has elephants, the Taj Mahal, Mother Theresa and poverty,&quot; he said.andM;Banking on the legendary skills in logic and mathematics, Indians began todream of their country as a bustling software factory--to become to softwarein the '90s what Taiwan and Korea are to hardware today.andP;  Considering thatthe worldwide software market today is estimated at an impressive $80 billionand rising, the incentive to translate the dream into reality is strong.andM;According to a special report in Computers Today, one of India's largestcomputer publications, India has about 360 firms that do some form ofsoftware development, and an additional 250 which process data and act asconsulting bureaus.andM;The main Indian software companies are the two &quot;big brothers&quot;: TataConsultancy Services (TCS) and Tata Unisys Ltd. (TUL).andP;  They dominate theIndian industry and together command a 70% share of the country's totalsoftware exports.andM;The revenue of TCS from the domestic software market is about one-third ofits total revenue.andP;  In TUL's case, its share of domestic software salesaccounts for only 5% of its total global software revenue--a fact whichclearly indicates the route India must take to realize its goals.andP;  Andprivate industry cannot do it alone.andM;The Indian government stepped in and made electronics its top priority.andP;  Inan effort to expedite matters and overcome its own slow-moving bureacuracy,the Indian government set up a system which greatly simplifies the clearingof proposals.andM;It set up an interministerial standarding committee, made up ofrepresentatives from the Ministries of Industry and Commerce, the Departmentsof Economic Affairs, and Telecommunications, the Planning Commission and theDepartment of Electronics (DOE), to provide a single-window clearance of allapplications.andP;  Clearances are guaranteed to take no longer than 90 days,according to S.S.andP;  Oberoi, director of the Software Development Agency whichworks directly under the DOE.andM;&quot;The Indian government is totally committed to making software development atop priority,&quot; said K.P.andP;  Nambiar, former secretary of the DOE.andP;  &quot;We arefocusing on software exports to the U.S.andP;  because that's the biggest market,and that's where the largest number of Indian software professionals abroadlive.&quot;andM;According to the Indian Consulate in San Francisco, about 700,000 Indianimmigrants live in the U.S., and the majority of them work in the electronicsand science fields.andM;Nambiar's hopes are high.andP;  He said this large pool of overseas Indians willbecome a good medium in U.S.-Indo business relations.andM;&quot;We want to keep our computer talent in India and are setting up softwaredevelopment and Randamp;D centers,&quot; said Nambiar.andP;  &quot;If we can provide them with anenvironment that will give them professional satisfaction--where they can doresearch and development, and invent new processes and products--they willstay.&quot;andM;ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTORSandM;Numberous incentive programs are aimed to attract American investors andnon-resident Indians to set up offshore development centers in thegovernment's new Software Export Technology Parks.andP;  According to Nambiar, aU.S.-Indo collaboration can take the following forms:andM;* joint venture with an Indian company, with the U.S.andP;  company holdingbetween 40% to 74% equity;andM;* 100% non-Indian-owned software technology park;andM;* U.S.-Indo software contract, with the software developed by an Indiancompany and marketed by its U.S.andP;  contractor.andM;&quot;These incentives won't remain forever,&quot; said Nambiar, sitting in hismodestly furnished office under a life-size portrait of Prime Minister RajivGandhi.andP;  &quot;These economic advantages are brief because we are developing fast.andO;Now, U.S.andP;  companies can use our brain power at one-fifteenth of the costthey would have to pay in America.&quot;andM;The Software Export Technology Parks are fairly large grounds that are zonedoff from the rest of the Indian world.andP;  There is no poverty and, instead,modern air-conditioned buildings nestle amid lush green, troptical bushes andfragrant flowers.andM;The rules that apply outside the gate do not apply inside.andP;  Import licensesare not required and customs duties are exempted for import of equipment suchas computer hardware, software, satellite communication equipment, testinstruments, spares and consumables.andM;Although these parks are supposed to be 100% export-oriented, foreigncompanies established within are allowed to sell up to 25% of their output inthe Indian domestic market.andM;There is no commitment to set up a permanent base in the park.andP;  Companies canutilize the park's infrastructure for transmitting their software only.andP;  Themajor software parks are located in Bangalore, Bombay and New Delhi.andM;The Bangalore software park is often compared to California's Silicon Valleybecause of its pleasant, mild climate and the many innovative softwarecompanies.andM;WIPRO, INSTAPLAN, TI AND CITICORPandM;The largest Indian software company in Bangalore is Wipro Systems Ltd., asubsidiary of the hardware manufacturer Wipro Limited.andP;  Wipro Systems sellspackaged software under the umbrella name &quot;Softpro&quot; and has an ongoing,co-developing and co-marketing agreement with the U.S.andP;  company InstaPlan,based in Mill Valley, Calif.andM;Together, the two companies developed a rather successful project managementpackage that sold over 25,000 copies, according to Gary Cole, president ofInstaPlan.andM;&quot;We design the software; Wipro programmers make it work; and then we sellit,&quot; said Cole.andP;  &quot;It'd be easier if we could do everything here, but it'smore cost-effective to develop in India, and you can develop even complexapplications there.andP;  FAX communications have dramatically improved within thelast six months.&quot;andM;According to Wipro, its programmers wrote 250,000 lines of code for InstaPlanin 20 months at a fraction of the cost for a U.S.-based programming team.andM;The largest American company in Bangalore is Texas Instruments (TI) India, acompany wholly owned by Texas Instruments Inc. in Dallas.andM;Established in 1986, TI India develops design automation software.andP;  Foreffective communications, TI has established a dedicated earth station thatlinks it with operations in Bedford, England, and in Dallas.andM;Another American company has settled in Seepz, Bombay's software park.andO;Citicorp Overseas Software Ltd., established in 1985 as an Indian company, isa 100% subsidiary of Citicorp.andP;  Its board of directors comprises Americansworking for Citicorp and Indians working for Citibank in India.andP;  Thecompany's CEO, Ravi Apte, is a graduate of the University of Maryland and hasan extensive technical background.andM;&quot;Citicorp India's mission is to provide information and technologicalsolutions for the financial services industry worldwide,&quot; said Rajesh Hukku,the firm's U.S.andP;  manager.andM;Have communications across the miles ever been a problem?andP;  Hukku replied inthe negative.andP;  &quot;We employ an extremely effective network owned by Citicorpwhich connects 90 countries,&quot; said Hukku.andM;UNISYS OWNS 40%andM;Aside from 100%-owned American companies, one finds many links between Indianand American companies in Seepz.andP;  Tata Unisys Ltd.andP;  (TUL) started as a tie-upbetween Tata and Burroughs in 1977.andM;TUL is a joint venture between Tata Sons of India (40%), Unisys Corp. (40%)and the Indian public (20%).andP;  Initially set up to provide consulting serviceslargely in the Unisys environment, TUL has branched out and acquiredexpertise in IBM, DEC, Wang and Hewlett-Packard environments as well.andM;TUL's headquarters in Seepz occupies 25,000 square feet and houses Unisys,IBM and Wang machines, and a host of microcomputers in local networks.andP;  TULhas branches worldwide and employs 700 software professionals and a staff of300.andM;Among TUL's recently developed software packages are Easydeal (an onlinesystem for dealers involved in foreign exchange and money market trading),SignBank (a signature verification system, running on Unisys Btos), andS.W.I.F.T.andP;  (a financial network for electronic transfer of funds).andM;&quot;We can set up a full development center for a foreign company fairly quicklyat Seepz,&quot; said Ravindranath, TUL's regional manager.andP;  &quot;For instance, werecently signed an agreement with a major French bank for setting up asoftware development and support center here.&quot;andM;The Banque Indosuez of France searched for a cost-effective solution tostandardize its branches in 68 countries.andP;  Because software development costsin France were prohibitive, the bank evaluated different locations in Europeand Asia and then decided on India.andM;Using TUL's office space and a TUL staff of 25, Banque Indosuez developssoftware which runs on IBM 4381s, 9370s and Wang equipment.andP;  The bank broughtin all hardware from France and sent one of its officers to India to overseethe project.andM;&quot;I am the link between Tata and our bank,&quot; said Robert Dufey, executivemanager at the Indosuez Development Center.andP;  &quot;It builds up great confidenceon both sides when you have someone who understands the work as aninterface.&quot;andP;  Although all quality assurance is done in Paris, communicationhas not been a problem according to Dufey.andP;  It was easy to get permission fora telephone and FAX system in Seepz.andP;  If one compares Seepz to the businesssituation in India some time ago (it could take two or three years to get atelephone and several days to successfully place a call from Bombay toDelhi), one can understand the progress that has happened in the softwareparks.andM;JOINT DEVELOPMENT WITH BOULDERandM;After successes in conventional areas, such as application development,support services and conversions, TUL moved into high-tech developmentprojects, such as CAD/CAM, networking, speech processing and expert systems.andO;TUL recently began a joint-development project with the Unisys CAD/CAMApplications Group in Boulder, Colo.andM;&quot;We've had a very good working experience with a particular group of TULprogrammers in the past,&quot; said Rosemary Brody, director of softwaredevelopment.andP;  The difference with the new project is that the TUL programmerswill not work in Boulder but in Bombay.andM;Prices change quite a bit when TUL needs to bring its software staff to theU.S.andP;  According to Srivastava, the cost abroad is about $5,000 perwork-month, while the cost in India is around $3,000.andM;Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is a large software house located in Seepz.andO;Although TCS and TUL are both part of the Tata Group, they compete againsteach other.andP;  The Tata group of affiliated companies is India's southernindustrial giant, bringing in revenues of over $3 billion.andM;TCS has been in existence the longest--since 1968.andP;  Specializing in computerand management consultancy, TCS has successfully completed over 350assignments in about 125 organizations worldwide.andM;Over 1,200 TCS software professionals work in many facilities in India andrepresentative offices in Asia, Europe and the U.S.andM;TCS distributes Oracle products in India.andP;  Its major software packagesdeveloped during the last three years include CasePac (a data dictionary tosupport program analysis, design, development and maintenance phases); FalconII (a local area networking package); and Prism (a project managementpackage).andM;Although most export-oriented software houses are situated in Seepz or othersoftware parks, some manufacturers prefer to remain outside.andP;  Locatedopposite Bombay's Century Bazar, Mafatlal Consultancy Services Ltd.andO;specializes in developing applications for the textile industry.andM;Mafatlal is a leading software house in India.andP;  Among recent major packagesdeveloped is an expert system for color matching which, together with itsapparel package for the IBM mainframe environment, has been well-received inIndia and the U.S.andM;&quot;In order to sell to the U.S., we needed to tie up with an American company,&quot;said Mukherji, divisional marketing manager at Mafatlal.andM;&quot;The cost of launching a new product in the U.S.andP;  is too high.andP;  Besides, wewould also have a distribution problem,&quot; he said.andP;  Mafatlal's U.S.andP;  partneris Databasics Corp. in New York.andM;&quot;I've done offshore development in India successfully for the past nineyears,&quot; said Don Liles, president of Databasics.andP;  &quot;When I first went to Indiato hire people for a project, I was surprised by the caliber of jobapplicants, people with Ph.D.s, people I could never afford to hire in theU.S., people who work very hard and still never forget to smile.&quot;andM;Computech International, another software house located outside a softwarepark, set up headquarters at a most challenging location: Calcutta, a citynotorious for blackouts and telephone malfunctions.andM;Computech is a very small company compared to TUL and TCS, employing about 30software professionals.andP;  Included among the employees is a large percentageof women and a supporting staff of 50.andP;  Computech sells to the Indian marketand specializes in application software, running on an IBM/370, and seismicsoftware, running on a VAX 11/780.andM;&quot;We have two generators which sufficiently run our equipment when the powergoes off,&quot; said Vargese Abraham, processing manager at Computech.andP;  &quot;Withinthe past six months, Calcutta has gotten much better, and power outages areless frequent.&quot;andM;Although the Indian software industry has made great progress within the lastfew years, Indian software houses still have to overcome many obstacles.andP;  Inorder to export to the U.S.andP;  on a large scale, they need to change America'sperception of India's &quot;horrible government bureaucracy, inferiorcommunication tools and rampant software piracy,&quot; Abraham said.andM;And in order to make substantial sales within India, they need to changeIndia's perception of software and the need for it.andM;BOOSTING SOFTWARE AWARENESSandM;&quot;We are not growing as much as we should,&quot; said Srivastava, who helped formthe National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom).andP;  &quot;Weneed to organize and focus on three main areas: Indian software environment,export and education.&quot;andM;India has not yet become an information society, and appreciation forsoftware is low.andM;According to some Nasscom members, the Indian government, which is thebiggest buyer, is used to buying bundled hardware, and Indian's vast middleclass--80 billion to 90 million people--has an educational background butknows little or nothing about software.andM;&quot;Computers haven't been marketed enough in India,&quot; said Srivastava.andP;  &quot;Look atthe choices our middle class has: microwave, video, color TV.andP;  'Whysoftware?' they ask.&quot;andM;Nasscom members praised the government's efforts in clamping down on softwarepiracy.andP;  The government recently reinforced the Indian copyright act bymaking the chief executive of a company that uses pirated software personallyliable.andM;Could it be that the often-quoted saying by Adam Osborne, CEO of PaperbackSoftware Inc., Berkeley, Calif., had something to do with this severe ruling?andO;Osborne told Indian attendees at a computer software conference, &quot;If youdon't change the law, you'll find Americans stealing Indian software.&quot;andM;NASSCOM CONCERNSandM;When Nasscom members were asked what guarantee they can give Americancompanies that U.S.andP;  technology will not end up behind the Iron Curtain, theyreplied that India, aware of its position in the middle, would not make sucha move.andP;  &quot;Besides,&quot; one Nasscom member commented, &quot;Europe is much better setup to ship high technology to the Eastern bloc.&quot;andM;Another Nasscom concern is education.andP;  Although India has the world'sthird-largest pool of university-trained technicians--approximately 2.5million according to a study by SRI International in Menlo Park,Calif.,--more software talent is needed.andM;Although the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) across the country turnout numerous graduates per year, many leave for abroad and others lackspecialization.andP;  Nasscom plans to supplement current education with seminarsand help the Indian government and private industries that have already takensteps to provide higher and more specialized training.andM;Currently, there are few schools like the National Center for SoftwareTechnology (NCST), which provides a chance to further software education fora larger segment of people.andP;  NCST is open at night and on weekends.andP;  Tuitionis less expensive and students can work during the day to pay for theireducation.andM;NCST was set up in 1985 as a major Randamp;D center by the government, and it ishoused by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, a private undertaking.andM;NCST is well-thought out in every respect.andP;  During office hours, NCSTfunctions as an Randamp;D lab; during off-hours, its facility is utilized byteachers who provide students with specialized continuing education.andM;Its new building, in a wealthy Bombay area, is charming compared to otherschools.andP;  Even its walls display modern paintings, which a visitor may buyand thereby support the population of local artists.andM;&quot;We like to give everybody a chance,&quot; said Dr. S. Ramani, NCST director.andO;&quot;NCST can afford to offer low-cost education because the institute makesmoney as an Randamp;D lab and does not depend on tuition.andM;&quot;We are keen to increase our female students and provide facilities for thosewho otherwise couldn't afford to get a software education,&quot; he said.andM;EDUCATIONAL LOANS ARE RAREandM;Although many in India want education, students who get a chance to workthrough college or receive a loan are rare.andP;  NCST offers that exceptionalopportunity.andM;Chandrakant, a local youth, works as a cleaner in NCST's library to puthimself through college.andP;  Harish Kotian works as a telephone operator duringthe day so that he can study at NCST at night.andM;Kotian is blind.andP;  &quot;I read in the Braille version of an American computermagazine about blind people in the U.S.andP;  who use computers by employing aspeech synthesizer that shows them what is on the screen,&quot; said Kotian.andO;&quot;This gave me hope that I, too, could fulfill my dream and become a full-timecomputer programmer.&quot;andM;Kotian has studied nightly at NCST for the past four years.andM;&quot;Software is acting as a catalysts in our country, giving hope to many,&quot; saidNasscom member Harish Mehta, executive director of Hinditron.andP;  Hinditrondevelops systems software, CAD/CAM, communication and application softwarerunning on DEC machines.andM;&quot;I am one of the 'nuts' that came back to India to start a company here aftera successful career abroad,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But, in retrospect, I haven'tregretted it even for a day.&quot;andM;Harding is a freelance journalist and director of marketing andcommunications at a software firm that is not mentioned in the story.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
