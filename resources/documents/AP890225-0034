Mrs. Aquino, who returned today from the funeral of EmperorHirohito, said international leaders _ among them President Bush _``they told me that they admire us Filipinos for that non-violentrevolution.''   She made her comments during festivities along Epifanio delosSantos Avenue, where hundreds of thousands of civilians massed threeyears ago to protect soldiers who had mutinied against Marcos.   But some prominent Filipinos who helped install her in powerboycotted the festivities to show disappointment with Mrs. Aquino'sleadership. Police estimated today's crowd at 30,000, smaller thanthe last two anniversaries.   In his anniversary address, Manila's Roman Catholic archbishop,Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, praised the spirit of the uprising but warnedthat corruption and political bickering had returned ``to the dismayof us all.''   Witnesses said the trouble started when about 3,000 loyalistsrallied near a television station demanding Marcos be allowed toreturn from exile in Hawaii. Marcos, in declining health, has livedin Honolulu since the uprising ended his 20-year rule on Feb. 25,1986.   Witnesses said three men bolted from the car and grabbed at leastone Marcos supporter and forced him into their vehicle. Whenprotesters rushed the car, the intruders fired in the air and spedaway, the witnesses said.   Later, police Pfc. Albert Gatos said he and two fellow officerswere transporting a robbery suspect to headquarters when theloyalists attacked their car. Gatos said the ``abducted'' loyalisthad been arrested.   Today's anniversary celebrations began with the ringing of churchbells across this island nation and included masses, fireworks andstreet dancing along Epifanio avenue. Smaller celebrations wereplanned in most provincial cities.   While Mrs. Aquino was in Tokyo for Friday's funeral, the160,000-member armed forces were on full alert because of couprumors sweeping the capital.   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre said about 2,000 troops wouldprovide security during the festivities, which will also include aRoman Catholic Mass, street dancing, fireworks and dedication of agiant statue of the Virgin Mary.   Meanwhile, the military said a soldier and two civilians werearrested outside the capital in a van packed with 1,650 pounds ofexplosives. A senior officer said the three are believed linked toright-wing extremists.   Lt. Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy chief of the National CapitalRegion Defense Command, said the soldier, a second man and a womanwere arrested late Friday in Taytay, a few miles from thecelebration site.   ``The implication is quite big,'' Oxales said. Asked if theexplosives were meant for a new coup attempt, he said: ``We'retrying to find out.''   The military also said an officer in a province about 200 milessoutheast of Manila was placed under restrictions for purportedlinks to renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, leader of a 1987attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino.   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the former defense minister, said hewould boycott today's festivities.   ``I will not join the celebrations because I think there is nocause for celebration,'' Enrile said. ``They really wanted changefor the country, but ... nothing is clear and our future is stilldim.''   Enrile in his former post led a mutiny against Marcos on Feb. 22,1986, that triggered the ``people power'' uprising.   But Enrile later turned against Mrs. Aquino. She fired him asdefense minister on Nov. 23, 1986, after a failed coup by hisfollowers.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, another key figure in the 1986revolt, said today the government needs more time to achieve all itsgoals.   ``We should not be discouraged,'' Ramos told reporters. ``Weshould not listen that our government is on the brink of collapseand that the Filipinos cannot do it.''   Liberals and leftist activists say Mrs. Aquino tolerates militaryabuses of civil rights in the government's 20-year war againstcommunist guerrillas and has not pressed land reform and othersocial programs.   On Friday, about 10,000 leftists took to the streets in Manila toexpress their dissatisfaction with Mrs. Aquino, shoutinganti-government slogans and burning a 10-foot papier mache effigy ofthe president.</TEXT></DOC>
