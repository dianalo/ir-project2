(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>EICON TECHNOLOGY CORP. EiconScript H8300/PC Eicon Technology Corp. is aCanadian company that specializes in a communications products and has morerecently entered the laser printer market.andP;  The EiconScript H8300/PC boarduses Eicon's proprietary PostScript interpreter to produce lovely output at600 by 300 dpi.andP;  Nonetheless, you should stay away from Eicon's printerboards until some awkward design features are remedied.andM;Eicon Technology believes that many people want to use the EiconScript boardas a full-time printer engine--and not necessarily with the Hewlett-PackardLaserJet.andP;  So, in addition to EiconScript, the company's clone PostScriptinterpreter, the board comes with a proprietary PCL interpreter calledEiconJet.andP;  Though you can send PCL files to your LaserJet via the Eicon board(the software includes batch programs to switch between EiconJet andEiconScript), you can't send jobs directly to the LaserJet through yourparallel port unless you use a special command-line argument in the program'sLPADOS utility.andP;  The Eicon board doesn't just enhance your LaserJet--itconsumes it.andM;Eicon's hardware components are similar to those of other boards we reviewed.andO;The interface card is a full-length, 8-bit board with a Motorola 68000processor (Eicon also makes a Micro Channel version).andP;  It comes with 2MB ofmemory standard, and you must add at least one piggybank 1MB module to printat the higher 600 by 300 resolution (you can expand it up to 4MB total).andP;  Itlagged behind the RIPS PostSCript board in our performance test results, butEicon is working on a new version of the board that will be equipped with thesame speedy Intel i960 RISC processor as the RIPS board, which should improveits speed.andM;An adapter board fits into the optional I/O slot at the rear of the HPLaserJet Series II, and a proprietary cable, which carries thehigh-resolution bitmap image, connects the two boards.andP;  The Eicon boardappears as LPT2 or LPT3 to your software, but the LPT1 connection is alsorequired to send the form feed to the printer.andP;  Both the DP-Tek andLaserMaster boards also handle form feeds on LPT1, but, unlike with the Eiconboard, you are free to access the native LaserJet when their printer boardsare not being used.andM;PITFALLS FOR THE UNWARYandM;The Eicon software and documentation are unnecessarily complicated.andP;  Thesoftware comes on ten 5.25-inch disks, while the documentation consists ofthree separate manuals: one for EiconJet, one for operation with the HPLaserJet Series II and Canon printers, and one for installation andconfiguration.andP;  There is some redundancy, and you're never quite sure whereto find the information you need.andM;The installation program interactively asks you to specify the type ofprinter you're using, the I/O port address, the IRQ line, and a memorywindow.andP;  Another program called LPATEST is supposed to help you determinehardware conflicts, but since the Eicon board accesses the hard disk forfonts and for error log files, window address conflicts can occur that goundetected by LPATEST.andP;  We encountered a doozy, in which Microsoft Windowsextended memory usage conflicted with the Eicon board's memory windowaddress, causing erratic operation: pages lacked certain fonts, extra formfeeds were added, and so on.andP;  It took an Eicon technical representative onsite at PC Labs, plus hours on a hotline to Eicon technicians in both Canadaand California to resolve their particular conflict.andM;In addition to the 35 built-in Bitstream fonts and the PostScriptinterpreter, the Eicon software includes hoards of utilities for managingboth EiconJet and EiconScript.andP;  You can add fonts, look at error logs, enteran interactive mode for sending PostScript commands directly to the printer,do batch printing, and more.andP;  The software is quite versatile, but theeccentricities of the file-naming conventions, the manual, and the userinterface make it a bit hard to use.andM;Once we finally got it working, the EiconScript's font quality wasexceptional.andP;  The small-point-size fonts were some of the most attractive andcrisp in our collection of products.andP;  But it's not enough simply to lookgood; you've got to act good, too.andP;  Products like EiconScript make you wonderwhether pretty printing is worth the bother.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
