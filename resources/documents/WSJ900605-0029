Moran andamp; Co.'s Garden City, N.Y.,office had only to consult their scripts, taped to desks andwalls. The scripts supplied &quot;power phrases,&quot; to be used onpeople reached through cold calling. &quot;This is going to comeback to us in a big way,&quot; was one such line. Another was,&quot;The perceived value is nowhere near the intrinsic value.&quot;And, &quot;We're gonna hit a home run with this situation.&quot;   If a prospective client hesitated, the broker might getpushy. &quot;I understand you want to talk with your wife,&quot; hemight ask, &quot;but does she go to work with you every day? Doesshe make the decisions?&quot;</LP><TEXT>   More hesitation could elicit a tougher follow-up: &quot;C'mon,drop your pompons and get into the game with the varsity.&quot;Or, &quot;Take your backbone out of the closet.&quot; Or &quot;Put your wifeon the phone; she's more of a man than you are.&quot;   High-pressure sales tactics like this are plenty familiarto Edward Modzelewski. Last month, the 50-year-old physicaltherapist got a cold call from a stockbroker who asked himwhether he wanted some investment ideas. Mr. Modzelewski washorrified. The caller, he says, was one of the same group ofbrokers that he contends bilked him &quot;through a pattern ofunscrupulous conduct and illegal stock-price manipulation.&quot;   After filing a $2.9 million claim with the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers in New York against severalof them and the firms where they worked -- First JerseySecurities, Sherwood Capital Inc. and J.T. Moran -- Mr.Modzelewski assumed he would never hear from them again.   Mr. Modzelewski and thousands of other investorsnationwide may be victims of what some prosecutors call &quot;thecockroach factor.&quot; Like roaches scurrying from the light,brokers often flee firms accused of fraud to escape the glareof government scrutiny -- then set up shop with a new name.   The Moran case seems a prime example. The scripts used bysome of the Moran brokers in Garden City -- not all of them,by any means -- came straight from the now-defunct FirstJersey Securities, where a number of the Moran brokers onceworked.   Of course, a broker with a blemished compliance record orexperience at a scandal-ridden firm is not necessarilyunscrupulous. Nonetheless, some former Moran clients say theywish that they had known about their brokers' questionablepasts and especially about the connection between Moran'sGarden City branch and First Jersey, the target of a highlypublicized investigation by the Securities and ExchangeCommission and grand-jury probes in New York and New Jersey.   Although recent government crackdowns on illicitactivities in the over-the-counter and penny-stock marketshave netted many swindlers, a lot more slip through thegovernment's grasp. That is partly because of the huge numberof brokers state and federal regulators must watch. But it'salso because of the way the government prosecutes securitiesfirms.   &quot;It's a common choice in law enforcement -- whether you goafter the big guys or the small guys, whether you pursue thestreet sellers of narcotics or the Colombian cartel,&quot; saysCharles Carberry, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan U.S.Attorney's office. &quot;And typically, because of resources, youpursue the head of the operation -- in these cases, the guywho's manipulating the stock and not the guys on the phonesselling it.&quot;   As a result, says Richard Berry, the head of enforcementfor the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, &quot;there is asubculture that will continue on and on after the key playersare put in jail.&quot; The small fry, he says, &quot;find a new home,another firm that will take them in for dirt cheap and thathas an appearance of legitimacy. . . . Investors never knowthe difference.&quot;   J.T. Moran, one of the firms sued by Mr. Modzelewski, tookin some wayward brokers, although many of its 18 branchesremain untouched by controversy.   Whether John T. Moran, who founded the firm in 1986, knewhe was buying into the &quot;cockroach factor&quot; isn't clear. Hedeclines to be interviewed. However, his lawyer, MartinKarlinsky of New York, says: &quot;Anybody who knew about FirstJersey would have to say they were aware there had beenproblems, but those were First Jersey problems, encouraged byFirst Jersey.&quot; Regarding the allegations against Moran, Mr.Karlinsky says that &quot;nothing has been proved&quot; -- or will beproved.   In January, Moran, which specialized in making markets inlow-priced stocks, filed for protection from creditors underChapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. In three years,Moran had built up a sales force of nearly 1,000 brokers --some of whom had checkered employment histories -- and becameone of the nation's 20 largest brokerage houses.   In recent months, Moran's problems have attracted theattention of investigators from the NASD, the SEC, theJustice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation andseveral state agencies. The investigators have been lookinginto allegations of stock manipulation and fraudulent salespractices at Moran as well as the financial ties betweenMoran and the companies whose stock its brokers pushed.   Meanwhile, some of Moran's nearly 90,000 customers havefiled claims against it with the NASD and in the federalbankruptcy court in White Plains, N.Y. They contend that theywere fleeced by Moran brokers who hyped stocks in smallcompanies with few assets and feeble prospects. Many of theseclaims involve Moran brokers who once worked for FirstJersey.   Several suits against Moran cite First Jersey veterans atthe Garden City branch, Moran's largest retail operation.What happened there, say former brokers not involved in thelawsuits, is that Moran inherited a legacy of high-pressuresales techniques from First Jersey brokers, who then becamemanagers at Moran.   Mr. Karlinsky says that in the spring of 1989, Mr. Moranassigned to the Garden City office a &quot;special officer toassure compliance with rules and laws. This was the onlybranch where Moran did this. It was the only branch thatneeded it.&quot;   There is ample evidence that the brokers who came to Moranfrom First Jersey did invest clients' money recklessly. Fiveformer Moran brokers say in interviews that many of theirclients had losses of 50% to 80% of their investments andthat few walked away with a profit.   Michael Magioncalda, a Long Island bagel-shop operatorwith a $144,000 claim against the firm and two brokers, hastape recordings on which one of the brokers guarantees thatMr. Magioncalda would never lose a cent if he purchased stockin Moran's parent firm at $1,000 per unit -- a violation ofSEC and NASD regulations. &quot;Even if it went below $1,000, bothhe {the broker} and J.T. Moran would guarantee that I wouldsuffer no losses,&quot; says Mr. Magioncalda in his claim, which,along with transcripts of the tapes, is filed at the NASD inNew York City.   The evolution from First Jersey to Moran went like this:In the spring of 1974, the SEC accused Mayflower SecuritiesCo. of stock manipulation and fraud. Later that year,Mayflower's then-26-year-old president, Robert Brennan, andthe SEC negotiated a settlement that included a 15-daysuspension of Mayflower's trading. In November 1974, a fewdays before the suspension was to begin, Mayflower clientsgot a letter saying their accounts had been purchased byFirst Jersey. After changing little more than the name, Mr.Brennan and Mayflower's top brokers had set up shop inMayflower's New York office.   In November 1984, after a cat-and-mouse game with the SECthat had already gone on for years, First Jersey agreed tosettle SEC charges alleging stock fraud. Subsequently, anumber of First Jersey managers were indicted. Theindictments out of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's officeresulted in two acquittals, one reversed conviction and aguilty plea to one misdemeanor count. Cases in which the U.S.Attorney in Newark, N.J., alleged money-laundering againstthree officials and two former brokers have ended so far inthree guilty pleas and one conviction. Some charges are stillpending.   In February 1987, after an avalanche of bad publicity, Mr.Brennan sold First Jersey's 33 branches, which by then had1,100 brokers, to Sherwood Capital. &quot;We were tainted,destroyed, damaged goods,&quot; a former First Jersey broker says.&quot;We desperately needed a new name, a new face. It was allvery smooth.&quot;   Sherwood, an over-the-counter market maker with onlyinstitutional clients, wanted to develop a retail force, saysa lawyer familiar with the transaction. &quot;This was a chance tobe a gigantic presence on the Street . . . a firm withtremendous power to generate money but without the albatrossof a bad name.&quot;   But the retail business posted huge losses, and, in thespring of 1988, Sherwood decided to sell it. Two former FirstJersey brokers who went to work at Sherwood blame theproblems partly on high-pressure sales techniques that led tosales cancellations and disgruntled customers.   In May 1988, Moran announced it had acquired five Sherwoodoffices, in Chicago, Hartford, Dallas, San Diego andHuntington, N.Y. Moran agreed to pay $1.8 million plus awarrant to purchase 400,000 common shares of Moran's parent,Manhattan-based J.T. Moran Financial Corp. Moran acquiredabout 250 brokers reputed to be Sherwood's top producers,including 150 or so at Huntington.   When Moran moved the Huntington office to Garden City lastyear, about half the sales staff had once worked at FirstJersey. Gregory Hasho, First Jersey's top producer and latermanager of Sherwood's Huntington branch, stayed on as Moran'sbranch manager.   And when Moran filed for Chapter 11 in January, the31-year-old Mr. Hasho and his troops landed at VanderbiltSecurities, a small New York firm specializing inover-the-counter stocks. As many as 150 brokers, includingsome First Jersey alumni, are operating in Hauppauge, N.Y.,in the old headquarters of Investors Center, a firm thatcollapsed last year under SEC pressure. Mr. Modzelewski sayshe was called from that office last month.   Mr. Karlinsky, Mr. Moran's lawyer, says Moran checked thebrokers' compliance records and found no problems. He addsthat Sherwood agreed to indemnify Moran for any difficultiesresulting from brokers' practices after the purchase. &quot;Thetruth of the matter is we have been dragged into thesethings,&quot; he says.   But it wasn't just the First Jersey connection that Moranwas &quot;dragged into.&quot; The troubled pasts of other acquisitionscaused problems. Some newly added brokers led investigatorsto Moran's doorstep; others hobbled it because regulatorsruled out new branches.   Moran's 1989 proxy statement lists Adnan Durrani as amanaging director and board member as well as a former seniorvice president at several big Wall Street firms, includingShearson Lehman. But according to his lengthy NASD record ofcompliance problems, the 30-year-old Mr. Durrani, who joinedMoran's Manhattan office in 1987, had been asked to resignfrom Oppenheimer andamp; Co. in 1984 for allegedly unauthorizedtransfers of customer accounts from his previous job at E.F.Hutton Co.; fired from Shearson in 1986 for unauthorizedtrades and other problems; and &quot;permitted to resign&quot; fromPhilips, Appel andamp; Walden Inc. in August 1987 after a New YorkStock Exchange investigator apparently tipped the firm's topofficers to his problems at Shearson.   Mr. Durrani couldn't be reached for comment. Speaking ofhim, Mr. Karlinsky says: &quot;His compliance history caused oneto stop and think about it. But we didn't think that,standing alone, it was a reason not to bring him into J.T.Moran. {Mr. Moran} had high regard for him and thought he wasan honest and forthright person; he gave reasons for hiscompliance problems and he {Mr. Moran} believed him.&quot; Mr.Karlinsky adds that no customers have complained about Mr.Durrani's work at Moran.   Last year Florida refused to allow Moran to open three newbranches. At Moran's Lauderhill, Fla., office, explains DonSaxon, the director of Florida's Division of Securities,&quot;There were violations of our antifraud provisions, failureto disclose a relationship between Moran and one of itsissues, among other things.&quot;   Moran's Lauderhill office was staffed largely by brokerswho had left such firms as Greentree Securities and RLRSecurities Inc. In early 1988, Florida regulators barredGreentree from the securities business for &quot;having engaged indishonest or unethical practices,&quot; according to NASD records.Says Mr. Karlinsky, &quot;I'm aware of compliance problems withRLR Securities. Moran screened out the brokers who caused theproblems.&quot;   What former Moran brokers call the &quot;legacy of FirstJersey&quot; can best be described as boiler-room tactics: brokersphoning unwary investors and urging, cajoling, even harassingthem into buying highly speculative securities.   Deception pervaded the system, the brokers say. Even thesound of a stock ticker that some clients heard in thebackground was a sham; brokers were simply pounding onstaplers. Over and over, brokers told clients, &quot;Give me 1% ofyour trust, and I'll earn the other 99%.&quot;   A common practice passed on from First Jersey was the&quot;three-call&quot; system for landing new accounts. The first, the&quot;prospecting call,&quot; made initial contact with a potentialcustomer. The &quot;qualifying call&quot; was to find out how muchmoney the investor had and to titillate him or her with whatthe broker called a hot prospect &quot;coming up soon.&quot; In the&quot;sell call,&quot; the broker hyped a stock as a no-loseproposition -- and never let the client hang up without acommitment to buy, brokers say.   In a $722,845 claim against First Jersey, Sherwood andMoran on file with the NASD in New York, Mark Everett, whoco-owns a graphic-design firm on Long Island, says that &quot;ifthe client hung up, the account executive would call backsoon thereafter with another suggestion. . . . If all elsefailed, account executives would buy stock for the customer'saccount even though not authorized.&quot;   A Connecticut investor, Theodore Vielenski, says in aninterview that he was &quot;hounded a lot&quot; while dealing withMoran and Sherwood. The superintendent for a Wallingfordcontractor complains, &quot;There were times when you said no, youdidn't want to buy, and then you'd get a statement saying youhad bought some shares in some house stock. That, I'd say,was a big ripoff.&quot; He was also bothered that his broker --the same one at both firms -- wouldn't send him prospectuseson the companies whose stock he was pushing.   Scott Chopsky, a computer consultant in Bridgeport, Conn.,says in an interview that he remembers his broker saying,&quot;This will go through the roof in the next couple of days&quot;and &quot;You will triple your investment within two months.&quot; Mr.Chopsky, who alleges he lost 80% of his investment, says hegot his first call in the early spring of 1987 when hisbroker was at Sherwood. He kept dealing with the broker, atMoran, through November 1989.   The Garden City brokers would typically make 200 to 300calls to clients each day. Peter Novrit, a plumber inBayonne, N.J., can attest to the phone frenzy. He says, &quot;Evenwhen I already had an account with Moran, I still got half adozen calls to open an account.&quot;   He even got one after Moran's bankruptcy filing. &quot;A monthago, I got a call. The guy said he was from VanderbiltSecurities,&quot; Mr. Novrit says in an interview. &quot;The firstquestion I asked: `Are you any affiliation of J.T. Moran?'The guy said yes. I said no thanks.&quot; He adds that he lostclose to 90% of his investments at Sherwood and Moran, allwith one broker.   Some former brokers admit routinely misleading clients.The clients were never warned about the risks in a &quot;housestock,&quot; a stock in which Moran made a market. Former brokerssay clients also didn't know the price they paid for housestocks included a hidden charge. Anywhere from 20% to 40% ofthe price would go to the firm, and half of that to thebroker. Branch managers would get a cut of every sale in thebranch. But brokers often told customers there was nocommission, brokers say. Says Mr. Vielenski in Connecticut,&quot;They lied to me so much; there was no mention ofcommissions.&quot;   Known as the &quot;chop,&quot; the brokers' cut was the carrot thefirm dangled before them. It encouraged them to sell housestocks rather than mutual funds or Big Board securities. Itwas on its 90 or so house stocks that Moran made most of itsmoney, say former brokers and clients, by selling andreselling the shares to clients at constantly higher pricesafter having bought them at very, very low prices.   The most infuriating aspect of dealing with the firm, sayseveral former Moran clients, was the difficulty of sellingtheir Moran stocks. Former brokers say they were discouragedfrom taking sell orders because the firm would lose money.   When Mr. Novrit, the plumber, wanted to sell his 6,000shares in Istec Industries andamp; Technologies, he says he calledhis broker dozens of times but couldn't reach him. Mr. Novrisays his broker had told him in 1988 that Istec, a smallIsraeli firm that, among other things, bred tropical fish,would be &quot;the deal of the century,&quot; but the stock began toplummet in early 1989.   &quot;I wanted out, but they would put me on hold and nevercome back. Or I would ask for my broker, and someone wouldsay he was not at his desk but he'll call you back. And thenhe wouldn't,&quot; Mr. Novrit says. &quot;Or they'd give me to anotherbroker and I would say `I want out. I want to sell.' This guywould say he couldn't do that for me; I would have to talk tomy broker. Then they'd put me on hold. On and on. And theprice just kept dropping.&quot; Mr. Novrit finally sold the stockthrough a broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton.   When Mr. Magioncalda, the bagel-shop owner, wanted to sellhis $100,000 stake in J.T. Moran Financial, he did reach hisbroker. But the broker refused to sell. As the price keptdropping, Mr. Magioncalda urged him to sell. In his claim,filed with the NASD in New York, the investor says hisbroker, in urging him to buy the units, had guaranteed thatif the stock price ever went below the purchase price, &quot;therewould be an automatic sale order for me, which was neverdone.&quot; He finally sold the stock through Josephthal andamp; Co. ata loss of $43,437.50, according to the claim.   Mr. Chopsky had a different problem. The computerconsultant says his broker sold stock out of his portfoliowithout telling him and then used the proceeds to buy anotherhouse stock. &quot;I got a notice in the mail saying I owed himmoney. He said he thought he was doing me a favor,&quot; Mr.Chopsky says in an interview.   Former Moran brokers at Garden City describe theatmosphere as &quot;cult-like.&quot; The drive to make money was theideology, and the leader was Mr. Hasho, the charismatic FirstJersey veteran. Until the second half of 1989, the averageMoran broker was taking home about $8,000 a month.   There are few blemishes on Mr. Hasho's compliance recordother than the recent complaints filed by Mr. Everett and Mr.Modzelewski. In November 1988, Sherwood Capital filed withthe NASD a disclosure saying 71 of its former brokers,including Mr. Hasho, had been overpaid commissions at thetime the firm's retail operations folded.   &quot;Each was notified of the overpayment, as was thebroker-dealer they are currently associated with,&quot; it says.&quot;All efforts to resolve this issue, which may or may not havebeen brought about willfully, have not succeeded in doingso.&quot; The matter is still pending, NASD records show.   Mr. Hasho, who declines to be interviewed, was a talentedmotivator. His posh Long Island estate and $1 million-plusincome was inspiration enough for new brokers. Also inspiringrecruits were the BMWs, Porsches and Jaguars in Moran'sparking lot. To keep the adrenalin pumping, Mr. Hasho and hissupervisors called at least one pep rally a day. Attentionwas lavished on the top producers. Laggards were labeled&quot;negs.&quot;   Sometimes, the ridicule was unrelated to production.Though Ernest Charous was a good producer, his new goldCorvette was flipped over in the parking lot -- an eventannounced over the office public-address system. Anotherbroker arrived at work on several occasions and found urinein his coffee cup and on his files. Some former brokers saythey have been harassed over the telephone even after leavingthe firm. (News staffers at this paper repeatedly receivedobscene calls while this article was being prepared.)   Moran's brokers vented frustrations by running through thehalls stamping their feet and shouting slogans. After makinga sale, they would ram a water-cooler bottle into the wall.Partitions and light fixtures were destroyed, a custodiansays.   People who have called on behalf of Mr. Hasho and theformer Garden City branch but won't identify themselves saythe former Moran brokers are spreading false informationabout their former colleagues. The motive, they say, is toattract former Moran clients to their new firms, though someof the former brokers who are talking to reporters, the NASDand the SEC no longer sell securities. And the former clientswho are suing, the anonymous callers say, are trying to blametheir own investment mistakes on their brokers.   Even though Moran's second public stock offering, inOctober 1988, brought more than $20 million, nothing couldstem the tide of red ink or stop the government frominvestigating. In December 1989, several NASD agents visitedthe Garden City office and confiscated scripts and otherrecords. A month or so later, the firm, its parent and twoother subsidiaries filed for protection under Chapter 11.   Just why regulators didn't pick up the scent of problemsearlier is a complicated issue. Investigators and attorneysblame the limited resources and the difficulties. &quot;Puttingtogether a stock-manipulation case is a very complicatedprocess,&quot; says Ira Sorkin, a New York attorney who in the1970s prosecuted many stock-manipulation cases. &quot;If there's anetwork of 300 brokers, where do you cut it off? You can'tindict them all,&quot; Mr. Sorkin says. &quot;And by the time you havea case against the ones you do nab, the nature of thebusiness is such that the rest have scattered.&quot;   Mr. Berry, the New Jersey enforcement director, notes thevalue of going after the top tier. &quot;It's not a deterrenceunless the message gets out, and it's easier to get themessage out when you've got the big players,&quot; he says. But headds that the common reluctance to prosecute minor players isa dangerous thing that many regulators seek to change. &quot;Thefailure to hold the brokers accountable sends the messagethat they can get away with lying to clients and a wide rangeof other crimes on a regular basis,&quot; he says.   But none of this assuages the frustration and anger offormer First Jersey, Sherwood and Moran clients. Says JoelBernstein, the New York attorney representing Mr.Modzelewski, &quot;He stuck with his broker largely because hebelieved if there was really something wrong, someone, in theNASD or the SEC, would be out there catching it. He thoughtthere was a system out there to catch the thieves, if theyexisted. Now, he's not so sure.&quot;   ---                                                                                                          Representative sample of the 90 or so stocks in whichMoran was a market maker, before and after the firm'scollapse in January 1990.                                                                                                                                        12/1/89   4/25/90   PERCENT                                  PRICE     PRICE     CHANGE                                                                                                           J.T.
