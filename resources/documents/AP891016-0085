(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Jim Bakker says he will continuehis television ministry, despite his conviction on fraud charges,as soon as he and his wife, Tammy Faye, can pay some bills.   ``We're going back on television, whether it's me or Tammy orTammy and me together,'' Bakker said Sunday upon return to his NewCovenant Church in Orlando.   Earlier this month, Bakker was convicted of defraudingsupporters of $3.7 million in connection with his former PTL orPraise the Lord ministry and its Heritage USA Christian retreat atFort Mill, S.C.   Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 24. Bakker faces a maximum120-year prison sentence and fines totaling $5 million.   Bakker took to the pulpit at the storefront church from which heand his wife have been broadcasting their new ``Jim and TammyShow'' intermittently since moving to Orlando in May.   No shows have been broadcast since his conviction at Charlotte,N.C. His lawyers had said after the trial that the TV ministry wassuspended indefinitely.   Bakker refused to meet with reporters and the media was barredfrom Sunday's service, but from outside Bakker could be heardspeaking freely about his trial and his faith to a crowd of 50 to100 people.   He denied defrauding so-called partners in Heritage USA who weretold they could have three nights free lodging a year in exchangefor large donations, and said that if he is sentenced to prison hewill go to jail an innocent man.   Bakker, 49, resigned from PTL in 1987 amid a sex scandalinvolving former church secretary Jessica Hahn.   Mrs. Bakker told the crowd her faith is strong.   ``I'm counting on God's peace,'' she said. ``I don't know whatthe next few weeks might bring. My emotions go up and down like aroller coaster.''   After the service, Bakker ducked out a back door trying to avoidreporters and photographers. A ministry spokesman said he had madean agreement with his laywers not to talk to reporters.</TEXT></DOC>
