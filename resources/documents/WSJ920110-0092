But if the Armyhas its way, America's shortage of qualified teachers willsoon belong to the past.   Victory in the Cold War has precipitated one of thelargest troop reductions ever undertaken by the U.S. armedforces. Within the next five years, more than 500,000 peoplewill be making the transition to civilian life. Most will beseeking new careers that will enable them to apply the skillsand experience gained in the armed forces to the civiliansector.</LP><TEXT>   The Army is strongly encouraging these men and women toconsider teaching as their new career. Utilizing informationprovided by the Department of Education, the Army hasestablished hotlines here and in Germany, South Korea andPanama to assist those interested in obtaining teachingcertificates. The response has been overwhelming. In justfour months of operation, more than 11,000 calls have beenreceived from military personnel.   A quick glance at the qualifications of these peoplereveals the vast potential waiting to be tapped by America'sschools. Of the 250,000 men and women scheduled to leave theArmy by 1995, 20% are officers, of whom 99% havebaccalaureate degrees. At the rank of major and above, 80%have either master's degrees or doctorates. Many have taughtfull time at one of the military academies or served on thefaculty of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College,the National War College, or one of the Army branch schools.   In light of this nation's critical shortage of qualifiedmath teachers, it is noteworthy that one-third of theofficers leaving the Army are qualified to teach high-schoolmath. In addition, according to a recent Army survey, between10% and 20% have engineering backgrounds that would enablethem to teach high school physics.   Yet look at how these would-be teachers are beingreceived.   Take the example of Col. Duane Mills. Scheduled to retirefrom the Army in two years, Col. Mills decided to put hismaster's degree in history to good use in the classrooms ofhis native Missouri. However, he was told that he must firstcomplete 15 to 20 hours of &quot;methods&quot; courses to obtain ateaching certificate. Since Col. Mills would have to holddown a full-time job while attending night school for hismethods courses, the certification process would take a yearand a half. Discouraged at this prospect, the colonel islooking for another job. The loss is Missouri's.   By contrast, Col. Albert Laferte retired from the Army twoyears ago and made a smooth transition into the teachingprofession. With a degree in aeronautical science, Col.Laferte sought to become a high school math teacher in NorthCarolina. Fortunately for him, he was able to take thecourses required to obtain certification while still onactive duty at Fort Bragg and then began teaching math atPine Forest Junior High School. He has since completed workon his master's of education and notes how enthusiastic NorthCarolina education officials are to have someone with hisqualifications teaching junior high school.   Considering the academic credentials of some of ourcurrent teachers and the quality of our teacher-trainingprograms, the U.S. is in no position to deny itself thewindfall of talent preparing to leave the armed forces. Thesemen and women are disciplined, highly motivated individualswith solid records of professional achievement. As rolemodels, they are desperately needed in America's classrooms.Their response to the call for further service to theircountry has been encouraging, but their talents will go fornaught unless we allow them to impart their knowledge to ourchildren.   Clearly, it is time to address the problem of alternativeroutes to certification. States must be persuaded to removethe barriers that keep good teachers out of the classroom.Currently, 30 states have some form of alternativecertification. Some of these programs are outstanding; othersare badly in need of reform. States that have no program needto create one.   The U.S. is not lacking in politicians willing to spenduntold sums of taxpayers' dollars on education. Yet theArmy's program to put tens of thousands of eager, competentteachers into our nation's classrooms does not involve vastexpenditures of money. Instead, it seeks to raise the qualityof American education by providing our schools with anabundance of talented teachers.   As President Theodore Roosevelt noted, there is only onegroup of people as deserving of their nation's gratitude asour soldiers, and these are the people &quot;who teach thechildren of the present how to be the masters of our countryin the future.&quot;   For those truly interested in the welfare of our children,the fight for alternative teacher certification must bejoined.   ---   Mrs. Hines is a deputy assistant secretary for trainingand education, Department of the Army.
