A big limited-partnership fund called America FirstFinancial Fund 1988 L.P. -- sold by Shearson brokers to30,000 individual investors -- was an unsuccessful bidder forGoldome's assets. The fund was set up to buy an ailingsavings bank by September of this year, a deadline that nowcan't be met. So, the fund must be dissolved and investorsgiven back the nearly $290 million they put in.</LP><TEXT>   That's the problem. Former and current Shearson brokerssay they assured investors all their money would be returnedif the fund didn't buy a savings bank. But yesterday Shearsondecided not to return any of the 10% in upfront fees thatcame off the top of investors' capital.   America First investors are coming out in far better shapethan people who lost everything in soured limited partnershipdeals. But they are miffed because they have lost theopportunity to make a profit in another investment. Worse,from their viewpoint, Shearson has made and will keep itsprofit on the deal.   The situation is unusual because of the terms of thepartnership. Unlike other underperforming partnerships thatslowly unravel, the America First partnership had a strictdeadline that is forcing Shearson and America First todissolve the partnership and to decide how to treatinvestors.   Shearson, the brokerage-firm unit of American Express Co.,was once the biggest seller of partnerships in the U.S.securities industry. The America First fund, run by AmericaFirst Cos. in Omaha, Neb., is the latest underperforminglimited-partnership deal on Wall Street.   Shearson and other big brokerage firms have pulled backfrom the partnership business as many deals hatched in the1980s have gone bad. Now, Shearson and other firms areunraveling their partnerships and deciding when and if tomake investors whole. Shearson officials said they're bracingfor investor complaints.   &quot;It's like someone buys a stock for $20 and sells it twoyears later for $20,&quot; one Shearson broker complained during aone-hour-plus conference call yesterday with officials of thefirm and America First.   Shearson officials explained to its brokers that the firmlegally doesn't have to return the money -- the fund'soffering documents said so. Besides, Shearson contendsinvestors are getting back practically all of every dollarthey initially put into the fund. In addition to the bigdisbursement that will soon be made, Shearson said, investorshave received quarterly interest payments from securities thefund invested in while shopping for an acquisition, plus asmall portion of principal.   Shearson says the actual profit it made from selling thepartnership was a &quot;small fraction&quot; of the $29 million in feesit collected, which included marketing and administrativecosts.   In a statement late yesterday, America First said thatGoldome had been the exclusive target of the fund'sacquisition efforts since the summer of 1990, but that theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. rejected its final bid.   &quot;A higher bid would not have been prudent for the fund andwould have resulted in insufficient government assistance,&quot;said Michael Yanney, America First chairman. &quot;We are choosingto return our investors' funds rather than live with thelong-term consequences of an inappropriate transaction.&quot;   The government last week divided Goldome's assets amongKeyCorp and First Empire State Corp. It was one of thelargest savings-bank seizures ever.   America First said investors should receive a specialdistribution on or about July 15 of $17.15 for each unit,which originally cost $20. A final, small distribution willbe made by year-end, the company said.   Shearson, in a statement, said that the $17.15-a-unitdistribution, &quot;plus the quarterly distributions previouslypaid by the fund, plus the amounts remaining after allexpenses are paid, will result in full recovery of capital byall investors.&quot;   The firm added: &quot;The fees paid by investors to the fundcovered marketing, legal, accounting and administrativecosts, and according to the agreement are to be paidregardless of whether the fund made an investment that meetsits high standards of safety of principal combined with highrates of return.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
