 Blyth Software, Inc. 1065 E.andO;Hillsdale Blvd., Suite 300 Foster City, CA 94404 (800) 843-8615; (800)223-8050 (CA)andM;High-end databases, such as 4th Dimension (4D) by ACIUS and Blyth Software'sOmnis 5, are part drawing program, part file manager, part interface builder,and part programming language.andP;  4D and Omnis 5 do similar things, but they dothem very differently.andM;4D was designed to support the Macintosh interface with Macintosh fonts,graphical-layout editing tools, and buttons.andP;  It was conceived as a user'stool -- whether the user is an average user who does simple data entry, apower user who designs on the fly, or a developer who wants to createstand-alone applications, for the run-time environment.andP;  4D's tools greatlysmooth the skill transition from novice to expert.andP;  In contrast, Omnis 5 isstrictly a developer's tool for producing custom applications.andM;A large difference between the two programs has to do with vocabulary --dissimilar terms are used to describe the same thing, and the same word usedin both programs can mean something very different.andP;  For instance, in 4D, awindow is an aperture for displaying layout; in Omnis 5, it describes what 4Dcalls layouts.andP;  Lists in Omnis 5 are similar to 4D's one-dimensional arrays;in 4D, lists are special resources stored in the structure file.andM;Because both Omnis 5 and 4D support external procedures, it's important toemphasize what each can do in its native state, without enhancements.andP;  Forexample, 4D provides pop-up menus as a standard control object.andP;  If you wantto use a pop-up menu in an Omnis 5 application, you have to use an external.andM;Layout EditorandM;Designing layouts (windows in Omnis 5) is one area in which 4D and Omnis 5are very similar, as both sport a MacDraw-like interface.andP;  However, 4D allowsyou to choose one of eight default layout templates.andP;  The only option inOmnis 5 is a blank sheet.andM;4D has more native control objects than Omnis 5, which doesn't have theformer's Radio Picture buttons, pop-up menus, nonflashing invisible buttons,graph areas, thermometers, rulers, or dials.andP;  Omnis 5 windows have nothingsimilar to 4D's &quot;included&quot; areas, which simplify multifile and subfile dataentry and navigation.andM;4D's standard button activities allow you to navigate between records andlayout pages, manage included areas, and accept or cancel the current record.andO;Buttons with these default actions require no code to function properly.andM;Another 4D feature that isn't available in Omnis 5 is the class of layoutelements known as external objects, which allow external procedures to runwhenever the cursor is over a particular area in a layout.andM;Many 4D external objects actually redraw in the layout editor to show whatthey will look like when your application is running.andP;  4D's external objectscan contain scripts, so that the entire area becomes self-configuring andself-contained.andP;  If you forget to install the external procedure thatsupports an area.andP;  4D will notify you while you're in the layout editor.andM;If you need to control the tab order of fields in your layouts.andP;  4D'sentry-order mechanism is far simpler to manage than the Omnis 5field-numbering mechanism.andP;  In Omnis 5, fields must be carefully aligned to agrid.andP;  With 4D, you select Entry Order from the Layout menu and use thecursor to trace out the tab order.andM;In addition, Omni's 5 windows do not have scroll bars, although Omnis 3provided this feature as an option, which causes problems for users who tryto upgrade to Omni 5 applications.andP;  4D allows you to choose whether or not tohave layout scroll bars.andM;Although Omnis 5 claims support for Macintosh fonts, you have to install thefonts into each application.andP;  Omnis 5 applications can have only 16 fonts perapplication, and two different font resources are maintained--one for reportsand one for windows.andP;  4D simply reads the available fonts from the currentsystem.andM;Menu EditorandM;4D allows 32,000 menu bars containing as many menus as will fit on yourscreen.andP;  Omnis 5 allows you to create menus, but it doesn't provide amenu-bar mechanism, and it stops displaying menu items at the 20th item.andP;  Youcan make Omnis 5 menus shorter but not longer.andM;In Omnis 5, a developer can end up with identically titled menus installed atthe same time.andP;  I contrast, you can set up 4D applications with a single menubar -- enabling and disabling items as needed -- and you can preview any menubut from the design environment as well as attach a picture to the splashscreen.andM;StructureEditorandM;4D's structure editor allows you to track very complicated file structureswith an updated graphic map.andP;  Many Omnis 5 developers keep such structuremaps of their own; because Omnis 5 doesn't provide this feature for them,they have to create it with something like MacDraw and update it with eachchange.andP;  In 4D, the structure editor is an intrinsic part of the designprocess, so you can view the fields in each file and the relations betweenfiles at any time.andP;  The structure editor also provides an easy path to theLayout editor and the field-definition dialog boxes.andM;Omnis 5 allows only 60 file formats, including memory-only files.andP;  4D,however, allows 99 files and unlimited variable definitions.andP;  A 4D file cancontain 511 fields, whereas Omnis 5 allows only 255.andP;  Omnis 5 also can'tcreate subfiles or multivalue value fields, whereas a 4D subfile can tie avery large number of data values to a single record.andM;4D doesn't limit how many fields you can index in a file, unlike Omnis 5,which limits you to 12 indexes per file and file format.andM;In 4D, &quot;relations&quot; compare the values of the connecting fields in each fileto determine whether the records are related.andP;  Whenever you chage the valuesof the connecting field in either file, 4D automatically reselects theappropriate related records.andP;  To create relations in 4D, you click on a fieldand then drag to the related field in the other file.andM;Procedure EditorandM;4D draws upon the Pascal programming language as the model for its procedurallanguage (Pascal is a widely used programming language that is clear enoughto be understood by novices).andM;4D's procedure editor feels like a word processor with lots of built-inshortcuts.andP;  In Omnis 5, you construct procedures by choosing from lists, butyou must always use that interface.andP;  4D allows users to mix writing styles,to type directly where applicable, to use point-and-click selection, and topaste in code from a text file.andM;4D has other time-saving attributes: For instance, typed-in fieldsautomatically appear in capital letters, procedure names appear in italics,and external procedures appear in bold italics.andP;  Conditional and loopingstructures automatically indent and appear in boldface to make the code morereadable.andP;  When you print a 4D procedure, lines are drawn to show whereconditional and loop structures tie off, simplifying the debugging process.andO;Omnis 5 provides only auto-indentation.andM;When you're defining procedures, Omnis 5 makes you select from a list.andP;  Thishelps you avoid typos but can take a lot longer than 4D's method of typing afew characters of the procedure and a wildcard character.andP;  4D definesprocedures with a point-and-click interface and pop-up menus.andM;4D has glossary tools much like the ones included with the Data Deskkeyboard.andP;  These tools can be set up to use a simple shorthand to typestandard procedure structures.andP;  My machine types the following whenever Ienter \fori&quot;: For ($i;1;Records in selection()) NEXT RECORD() End forandM;Omnis 5 function names--such as #EN and #L--can sometimes seem like secretpasswords, so you're likely to keep a crib sheet with you for some time.andP;  Incontrast, 4D function names are brief phases, such as Error and ModifySelection.andM;DebuggerandM;Omnis 5 provides no direct aids for tracking down logic errors, making it atime-consuming process even if you have good tools.andP;  4D's debugger helps fixundefined variables, fields with the wrong values, and improper recordselection.andP;  You can also check field values and variables.andM;Report GenerationandM;4D has three ways of generating reports and two for creating labels.andP;  Omnis5, on the other hand, has only one report editor.andP;  In the simplest case, a 4Duser can select Print or tie a Print Selection command to a menu in theruntime environment and 4D will print the selected records.andP;  You can use thelabel generator to print labels with or without a 4D layout.andM;You can use 4D's Quick Report editor to save ad-hoc reports: drag fields intoa report area; add sorts and calculations; change fonts; specify breaks; andrequest subtotals, counts, or other statistical functions.andM;The Print Layout command can be used in a procedure with multiple layouts tocreate reports that redefine themselves as the data being printed changes.andM;DocumentationandM;4D's documentation comes in the form of compact, spiral-bound booklets thatlie flat, unlike Omnis' cumbersome D-ring binders.andM;Once you're familiar with an application's commands, you're likely to use themanual to verify syntax.andP;  An alphabetical listing at the back of the 4Dcommand reference shows syntax and page references.andP;  This greatly reduces theamount of page flipping you need to do.andM;The 4D manuals are also organized according to functional groupings.andP;  Forexample, all the commands related to arrays are close together.andP;  This isparticularly useful when you're in the early stages of learning to write 4Dcode.andM;I tried to look up Functions in the Omnis 5 documentation and found a listingin the Application Designer's Handbook.andP;  The entry pointed out that thedescriptions of the built-in Omnis 5 functions are in the programmer'sreference, but it gave no page.andP;  I tried to look up how to install externalprocedures in Omnis 5, but I couldn't find this either.andP;  When I looked upExternal Areas in the 4D Glossary and Master Index, I found what an externalarea is, how external procedures are installed into a 4D application, andreferences to more-detailed information.andM;RebuttalandM;Mapping databases.andP;  Even experienced developers must prototype, experiment,and revise when creating a complex system.4D's development environment allowsyou to use 4D itself as the prototyping tool, and it helps you visualize theprocess.andM;A graphical structure editor also makes a permanent record of the filestructures.andP;  Developers shouldn't be expected to keep the database in theirheads--the application should be largely self-documenting.andM;Relational versus Hierarchical.andP;  The relational and hierarchical models ofdatabase design have been debated for years and will continue to be.andP;  Neithermodel completely solves every situation.andP;  That's one reason why 4D providessubfiles as another design option.andM;Event Management.andP;  Before, During, and After phases support a broad range ofdata-entry management.andP;  The Before and After phases initialize the recordprior to display and updating related records or adjusting the modifiedrecord itself after it has been accepted by the user.andP;  A During phase occursevery time the user edits a field and exits or clicks on an object in thelayout.andP;  Commands such as Set Enterable and Go To Field give you control overlayout navigation and data entry.andM;Report Generation.andP;  David Swain's discussion of report generation misses manyof 4D's options.andP;  4D's Report command can be used in a one-line procedure tobring up the Quick Report editor.andP;  The commands Sort Selection and PrintSelection allow a simple report to be generated with sorting -- far morestraightforward than copying data into a list, sorting it, and printing it.andM;4D has a search command that lets you build optimized searches with up to 256criteria.andM;It's also incorrect to say that 4D can open only one window at a time.andP;  Youcan open as many windows as you like, depending on available memory, althoughyou can enter data only into the top window.andM;Finally, operations that use transactions are faster than those runningwithout them.andP;  Transactions should be used sparingly to optimize the system'sresponsiveness instead of bogging it down.andM;You have to look beneath the surface of multiple-file, multiuser databaseapplications to see their real qualities.andP;  Speed, flexibility, and dataefficiency are the most important elements, and their absence can't be maskedby even the cutest interface.andM;If you have complex database needs.andP;  Omnis 5 is a good choice.andP;  You can useit to create applications that would have required minicomputers ormainframes a few years ago.andP;  As a result, development and hardware costs aresignificantly lower, and applications are much more flexible and easier foroperators to learn and use.andP;  And Omnis 5 is almost identical on both the Macand PC platform.andM;Businesses and corporate departments that track numerous transactions are thetype of environments that rely on Omnis applications.andP;  In contrast, 4D isprimarily a consumer product.andP;  It works well in single-user applications, butit lacks the power and flexibility to maintain adequate speed in high-volume,multiuser situations.andM;Omnis 5 is an update of Omnis 3, which was the first viablemultiuser-database platform for the Mac.andP;  Omnis 5, introduced last year, haseven more data-management strength and flexibility, as well as more interfacefeatures and programmers' aids.andP;  It ships with a set of externals that allowHyperCard to become a powerful multiuser, multiple-file database.andM;Omnis 5 now has interface features comparable to those of other databases,and it's an easier, faster development environment for experiencedprogrammers than both Omnis 3 and other databases.andM;The Hybrid Database ModelandM;Omnis is a hybrid of the three multiple-file database models, which arerelational, hierarchical, and network.andP;  The relational database deals withmultiple related information files.andP;  All files are independent, andrelationships are established by records from files that share a common fieldvalue.andP;  Relational databases, such as 4D are easy to use, but they deal withmultiple files one at a time.andM;The hierarchical database orders information in a rigid structure ofcategories, subcategories, and sub-subcategories.andP;  A record at the lowestlevel includes the information of all levels of linked records above it.andM;In the network database, file links are flexible and are of the many-to-manyrelationship type, which tends to be more typical of a real-world worksituation.andM;Omnis 5 is the first multiple-file database language to combine the flexiblerelational model, the highly organized hierarchical methodology, and thenetwork-database theory's ease of dealing with many-to-many relationships.andM;Omnis 5andM;The OmnisandM;ConnectionandM;An Omnis programmer can establish relationships among files by creatingcommon fields to link records, but a better way is to use the OmnisConnection facility, which allows each file to be connected to as many as 12files.andM;The connected records act as extensions of each other.andP;  If you connect a filerepresenting invoice information to a file for customer information, you canautomatically locate the customer record for that invoice by locating arecord in the invoice file (using the Find, Next, or Previous commands).andO;This can save countless programming steps as compared with strictlyrelational methods.andM;IndexesandM;All multiple-file database products can create and maintain indexes.andP;  Theseare used to quickly locate records with specific field values and to browsethrough a file in a specified order other than the one in which records wereentered.andM;Connected file records, including their indexes, act as extensions of themain file record so an invoice record can be located by use of a customer'slast name, zip code, or any other field indexed in the customer file.andP;  Asingle command can build a list of invoices for a customer ID, state, zipcode, or any other indexed information in any connected file.andM;Multifile UpdatingandM;Because Omnis 5 sees the current records from all files as one huge record,updating information is simple.andP;  For instance, Omnis can simultaneouslyupdate customer records, a daily sales-tally record, and a system-informationrecord every time a new invoice record is created.andP;  4D has to update eachrecord separately -- even in single-user mode.andM;The Learning CurveandM;Programmers need to study a lot before they are proficient in eithe Omnis 5or 4D, and Omnis 5 makes no pretense about this.andP;  4D, however, offers someshortcuts that can draw in and trap novice programmers, in essence making thetotal learning curve much longer.andP;  For instance, 4D's graphicalfile-structure editor invites novice programmers to experiment rather than toplan out the work ahead of time.andP;  For a while, it seems that work is beingeasily generated, but if you discover later that some fields or files you'vecreated are not required, 4D doesn't allow you to delete them.andP;  This kind ofprogramming almost always leads to wasted time.andM;4D's graphical procedure editor is another trap.andP;  It allows you to design aflowchart of a procedure, but once you've begun designing a procedure thisway, you must continue, because the graphical procedure editor doesn't createeditable code.andP;  If it did, it would be a hot feature.andM;Procedure EditingandM;To access commands in 4D, you type the first few letters and then a wildcardcharacter, which brings up the first keyword in the commands list that beginswith those letters.andP;  Omnis 5's more responsive method of keyboard access tocommands, field names, and functions means that you're not typing blind: Asyou type in each letter of a command keyword, the selected line in the listchanges to the first line that matches the character-string typed so far.andM;You can also use a wildcard that can be embedded in the typed string and thatacts as an &quot;any string&quot; substitute.andP;  For example, to select the Open windowcommand, the programmertypes o*w.andP;  Omnis 5 reads this as &quot;the first commandbeginning with an o that also contains a w.&quot;andP;  Most commands can be selectedby four or fewer keystrokes.andM;EventandM;ManagementandM;Omnis 5 has the most complete set of event-management tools of any Macdatabase-programming language.andM;Where field scripts in 4D can deal only with Before, During, and Afterevents, Omnis also reacts specifically to Tab, Shift-Tab, Click,Double-Click, and Window-Click events, which means it can treat any fieldobject as a button that can trigger a procedure.andM;There are also Set Next Action commands, which give programmers control overthe outcome of events and the application's conditional flow.andP;  For instance,when tabbing forward from a gender field in a medical record, you'll seedata-entry windows for either a male or female patient, depending on what youspecified in the initial input.andM;Omnis 5 also includes optional window-and application-control procedures thatcontrol non-field-specific events and manage complex sets of possibilities,such as monitoring the operator's use of multiple open windows.andM;MenusandM;Omnis 5 has independently installable and removable menus.andP;  You have todefine the menu only once, and its custom File and Edit menus simply replacethe standard ones in their proper positions.andP;  In 4D, however, you have todefine a new menu bar, even if you want to add or remove only a single menu.andM;Because operators need fast access to their commands and often prefer to typekeyboard command equivalents rather than use the mouse, a long scrolling menusuch as those 4D often uses wastes time -- and you run out of easilyremembered keyboard equivalents when you have more than 30 menu itemsavailable.andP;  Omnis 5 limits accessible items to 20 per menu, more than enoughin most situations.andM;ReportsandM;Relational reporting is one of Omnis 5's strong suits.andP;  In contrast, 4D stillrequires many procedures to accomplish what Omnis 5's report generator doesroutinely.andM;For example, Omnis 5 includes default sort and subtotal specificationsdirectly in the report definition.andP;  These can be overridden by procedurecommands, but the report can stand on its own.andM;4D requires that procedure commands define sorts and subtotal breaks.andP;  Thismethod isn't much more trouble than Omnis 5's method for a simple report, butwhen a complex definition is needed, Omnis 5 is much easier to use.andM;For particularly complex and demanding reports, Omnis 5 can create proceduresfor controlling the record location and reporting process, use lists astemporary sort buffers, and override sort fields and parameter setups.andP;  Themore complex the application and the report are, the more speed advantagesOmnis 5 has over its competition.andM;There are two areas in which Omnis 5 could be improved.andP;  First, it can't savethe page and job setup for a report without using an external.andP;  Second, 4Dhas a good report-charting feature -- and though Omnis 5 can launch Excel,Wingz, or Cricket Graph, it would be nice to have charting capabilities too.andM;Intelligent MulticriterionandM;SearchesandM;Omnis 5 has built-in optimization features that utilize search formats,sort-field specifications, and indexes to limit the records considered for areport.andP;  4D can perform an indexed search only on a single criterion or bylinking the search through Boolean operators.andM;For example, if you wanted to locate all unpaid receivables of more than $500from California, Oregon, and Washington, 4D would have to consider everyreceivable record in the entire file.andP;  Omnis 5 has to consider only theunpaid ones to locate this specific subset.andM;Reusing the Building BlocksandM;Omnis 5 procedures and objects can be cut and pasted in the Scrapbook orbetween windows, menus, or report formats within or between applications.andO;Fields retain the procedures attached to them.andP;  Omnis 5 can also move anymajor application aspect (for instance, file or window formats) directly intoanother application.andP;  Professional database designers are able to developmodules that can be moved from application to application in a matter ofseconds, merging features from different programs into a new, customizedsolution quickly and efficiently.andP;  To do this in 4D, you have to pay up to$200 to get ACIUS's new 4th Dimension Mover.andM;Transaction ProcessingandM;The 4D Transactions feature temporarily returns an application to single-usermode, locking all files until the transaction is accepted or canceled.andP;  Onlyone transaction can be active at a time.andP;  This kind of &quot;application locking&quot;is fine in a simple multiuser system in which only one person does data entrywhile a few others have access for browsing and reporting.andP;  But 4Dtransactions bog down the work flow when many people are using the databasefor different activities.andM;An Omnis 5 application can update records in multiple files in a singlewrite, with safe record locking.andP;  Only the actual records required by eachuser are locked for that user -- and only momentarily.andM;User ExperienceandM;A 4D application and Omnis 5 application might look and, superficially, workidentically -- but the Omnis application would be noticeably faster,especially during a complex data-entry procedure with other users on-line.andO;This speed advantage is also apparent during data retrieval and reporting.andO;With the 4D application, operators waste a lot of time waiting to put in thenext transaction.andM;Omnis 5 allows up to 30 windows to be open simultaneously -- 4D allows only1.andP;  A customer-service operator using an Omnis 5 application can open a listof invoices, payments, returns and refunds, telephone contacts, and notes ontop of the customer-information window and arrange them for easy viewing.andM;RebuttalandM;New Features.andP;  After this review was completed, Omnis 5 added even morenative interface features -- pop-up and hierarchical menus, for example.andM;Fonts.andP;  The font list in Omnis 5 is like style sheets in a word-processingprogram.andP;  If you change a font in the list, the program changes it globally.andO;This allows compatibility between applications when you're porting a Macapplication to the PC.andM;Procedure Editing.andP;  By default, Omnis 5's procedure editing provides the samefunctionality as the &quot;wild-card&quot; in 4D, but with one less keystroke than 4Drequires, and you can see the selected command as the selection stringevolves.andP;  Field names automatically show in capital letters in both Omnis 5and 4D, but in Omnis you can select them from a list, just as you selectcommands.andM;Documentation.andP;  The documentation for both products is weak, but Omnis 5ships with a DA that references its manuals, so help is always available.andM;Double HelixandM;Double HelixandM;Double Helix 3.0 is one of the fastest multiuser Macintosh database programsaround (see MacUser Labs tests).andP;  It has the most Mac-like interface, makingit easy to learn and use, and its multifile databases aren't built in code;they're built with a variety of icons symbolizing different &quot;relations,&quot; orfiles.andP;  Relations are composed of fields, templates, abaci (calculations),and other elements.andM;Unlike Omnis 5 and FoxBase+/Mac, Double Helix doesn't limit how many filesyou can open; how many icons, labels, or fields may be added to a file; orhow many characters may be added to a field.andP;  By using subforms and look-upabaci, developers can draw information from all files.andM;Because Double Helix combines data and structure, objects can be modified inthe database without special provisions.andP;  Thus, structural development andrefinements are point-and-click operations.andM;Whereas other databases offer only one way to view a collection's structure,Double Helix offers three.andP;  The View by Icon mode groups icons on-screen, andthe View by Kind and View by Name modes allow you to add a description of anicon's function.andM;Double Helix's templates, which can be of any size, have multiple layers: Youcan scan or draw a company's forms and then import them into a template'sbackground.andP;  Version 3.0 also has button fields, which allow developers touse text or pictures to make various functions automatic, and the program'snew sequencing capability is similar to QuicKeys!andP;  Both files and collectionscan be exported into your word processor for hard-copy evaluation.andM;Double Helix allows developers to produce an unlimited number of fourdifferent types of menus: Administrator, Regular, Submenu, and Prototype.andO;Prototype menus can be duplicated for distribution as needed -- to new staffmembers, for instance -- with new or changed passwords.andP;  These functions arefar more difficult in the other databases reviewed, either because theirinitial programming is more complicated or because their systems are moredifficutl for users to master.andM;Double-Helix has some limitations.andP;  It cannot directly address the serialport, so it can't be used with a nonstandard printer that lacks a printerdriver or be used to bypass the printer driver in a standard printer.andO;Developers should be able to overcome this limitation with the CommunicationsToolbox, which is expected to be part of Apple's System 7 release.andM;Double Helix is the most user-friendly database currently available.andP;  It'sideal for those who lack a programming background: The icon system enablesanyone who can master basic algebra to program a sequence such as &quot;If X =this and isn't andgt; Y then do Z.&quot;andM;Double Helix has one last advantage: It's the only program that can be portedto any DEC VAX running VMS.andP;  This offers great speed potential and allows formore users simultaneously running multiple Helix databases on-line.andM;Double Helix 3.0andM;Double Helix lets users build relations in multifile databases with iconsrather than code.andP;  Its flexible file structure allows an unlimited number oficons, labels, or fields to be added to a file.andM;Pros: Double Helix is fast, particularly in multiuser mode, and easy to use.andO;Its icon orientation makes development and programming simple.andP;

 But if youneed more power than Macs can provide or if your company already has biggercomputers, you may want to run your database on a mainframe host.andM;Apple's marketing push into host connectivity has resulted in excitingproducts that provide the best of both worlds: the dataprocessing power of alarge minicomputer or mainframe accessed from your desktop through a friendlyMac interface.andM;Host connectivity is certain to be a hot topic in the early 1990s as Macs aremore closely integrated into the corporate MIS world and as Mac users demandmore database power.andP;  We'll be covering these topics in detail in futureissues, but for now, here's a quick summary of some of the options availabletoday:andM;* CL/1, Apple's new connectivity language, is quickly becoming a standardinterface between Macs and host databases.andP;  New applications such as ClearAccess and GQL -- or extensions to HyperCard, Wingz, and other similarprograms -- give a completely transparent Mac front end to an SQL database.andO;The line between the two worlds is also blurred by the fact that 4thDimension, Omnis, and Double Helix can -- or will soon be able to -- accessdata with CL/1.andM;* SequeLink, the granddaddy of host-connectivity languages, has allowedaccess to host data from a Mac front end for many years.andP;  It can be used fromHyperCard and 4th Dimension, among others; and can access Ingres, SyBase, andother leading SQL databases.andM;* Oracle offers external routines for 4th Dimension, HyperCard, and otherprograms that allow access to Oracle databases on a wide range of hostcomputers.andM;Each of these products transforms the host into a data server for your Mac,returning the information that your Mac requests.andP;  Other solutions, includingMitemView and MacWorkstation, allow you to put a Mac front end onto yourexisting host databases without substantial rewriting.andM;Note that every one of these products is merely a pathway between aprogrammable application on the Mac, such as HyperCard or a database program,and a host database.andP;  But these products can't handle all possiblesituations.andP;  You can get a wider range of choices with a DEC VAX and one ofthe leading SQL-compatible databases.andM;Speed-Testing the Top Four Macintosh DatabasesandM;Speed is the big issue in the database wars.andP;  Different features, however,make it difficult to come up with tests in which all the products compete ona level playing field.andP;  The test results may or may not be applicable to yoursituation, but you shouldn't choose a database program on speed alone.andM;The TestsandM;The tests were done with a small sample application designed for a medicaloffice.andP;  The database included two files, one of 5,000 patients and one of15,000 charges and payments.andP;  Each patient had coded charges and/or paymentscontaining the account number.andP;  Both files had about ten fields, some ofwhich were indexed.andM;We used two Mac SE/30 computers, each with 2 megabytes of RAM and an80-megabyte hard-disk drive.andP;  One machine was a workstation, the other a fileserver connected with Phone Net.andP;  The file server used AppleShare software;Double Helix used its own server software.andP;  A different network or hardwaremix may produce different results.andM;The databases were given the following commands:andM;Indexed Search for One RecordandM;Search for the first patient whose last name is Smith.andM;Indexed Search for All Matching RecordsandM;Search for all patients with the last name Smith, and do something with eachone that will cause the records to be loaded from disk.andM;Indexed Search and DisplayandM;Search for all Smiths, and display them in a list on the screen.andM;Add DataandM;Automatically create ten new charge records for one patient, and add them tothe charge file; then find that patient, update his or her current balance,and save the patient's record.andM;Delete DataandM;Delete ten patients and all of their charges.andM;Change Data in an Indexed FieldandM;Find all 100 charges with the code of N, and change each occurrence of thatcode to Y.andM;Search across Two FilesandM;Find all the patients who have had a charge with a certain code.andO;(Essentially, find all the charges with that code, and then find all thepatients whose accounts match those charges.)andM;Small Nonindexed SearchandM;Search for all patients whose last visit occurred after a given date.andM;Large Nonindexed Search and SubtotalandM;Search for all charges after a certain date, and calculate the total amountof those charges.andM;Data-File SizeandM;The size of the data files on the disk was recorded.andM;FoxBASE+/MacandM;FoxBASE+/Mac runs programs written on DOS machines using the dBASE language,giving programmers full control of the Mac interface.andP;  It integrates dBASEwith a nonprocedural graphical interface that allows anyone to performcomplex operations without writing source code.andM;Since FoxBASE+/Mac's first release, it has added a MacDraw-like screenpainter for designing input screens, a powerful report generator, support forHyperCard XCMDs and XFCNs, and a template generator to help write code.andM;FoxBASE+/Mac offers a View window that shows relations among open files, aSetup dialog box that lets you examine or change the database's structure;and a Command window that lets programmers re-execute commands for pastinginto a program.andP;  Nine output screens are available, and trace and debuggingwindows allow programmers to monitor their work.andP;  FoxBASE+/Mac supports colorand large-screen monitors.andP;  You can use commands or the screen painter tocreate HyperCard-like applications.andM;Screen-refresh speed is slow, and performance is weak in multiuseroperations.andP;  This problem may make a foxBASE+/Mac application look slow, butthe data handling is extremely fast.andM;FoxBASE+/Mac 2.0andM;FoxBASE+/Mac lets users perform sophisticated procedures without having toknow how to write dBASE source code.andP;  For programmers, it includes featuresthat help in writing applications.andM;Pros: FoxBASE+/Mac runs DOS programs written in dBASE; it is fast insingle-user operations.andP;  dBASE extensions give programmers full control ofthe Macintosh interface.andM;Cons: Speed declines in a multiuser environment, particularly overAppleShare.andM;FoxBASE+/Mac speeds through single-user performance tests by usingRAM-caching techniques that aren't available when a file server houses thedata.andP;  As a result, its performance is degraded on a network.andM;FoxBASE+/Mac consistently beat Omnis 5 and 40 on a single machine, but ourtests found a large performance decline in a multiuser environment.andP;  In oneexample, it took 2 seconds to change a code on 100 charges in single-usermode but 95 seconds in multiuser mode.andM;These tests, however, involved a slow LAN topology, which Double Helix'sdata-server technology side-steps.andP;  Over Ethernet, FoxBASE+/Mac would haveperformed better, probably beating Omnis 5 and 40.andM;Fox Software's FoxPro/LAN (not available at press time) should greatlyincrease LAN speeds on updated FoxBASE+/Mac multiuser applications.andM;FoxBASE+/Mac strengths lie in its processing speed, use of the Mac interface,and ability to port dBASE code from DOS and run multiuser applications in aPC/Mac environment.andP;  Programmers looking for a relational database forwriting true Mac applications should look at FoxBASE+/Mac.andM;It requires dBASE program code; does not provide smooth field-level checking;needs serial-port communications, a more versatile reportgenerator, andbuilt-in CL/1 or SQL capabilities.andM;Requires: Mac Plus or later with 1 megabyte of memory, System 4.2, and finder6.0 or later.andM;List Price: $495;
