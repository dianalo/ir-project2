Also Tuesday, five people were wounded in shelling byIsraeli-backed militiamen in a Shiite Moslem village after aguerrilla attack, police reported.   They said militiamen of the mainly Christian South Lebanon Army,Israel's proxy militia in southern Lebanon, and pro-Syrian SunniMoslem gunmen of the Popular Liberation Army traded artillery in thehilltop Kfar Falous village south of Sidon.   Police did not have an immediate casualty figure from the KfarFalous fighting. They said a few shells fell in orange groves inSidon, inflicting damage but no casualties.   Kfar Falous is the forwardmost position held by the SLA inIsrael's self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.   The two militias have clashed frequently around Kfar Falous inthe last three years, but they have refrained from mounting groundassaults against each other.   In the other incident, police said pro-Iranian Shiitefundamentalist guerrillas attacked South Lebanon Army positions inthe hilltop villages of Alman and Shoumarieh inside the securityzone.   The guerrillas fired four Katyusha rockets at the two positions,touching off a three-hour clash with machine-gun fire, they said.   South Lebanon Army militiamen and Israeli troops retaliated byshelling Zawtar, four miles from the southern market town ofNabatiyeh.   Police said among the casualties were a 54-year-old man and hiswife and daughter, who were injured when a mortar round slammed intotheir house.   In another development, a Norwegian humanitarian organizationappealed for the release of doctor Jan Cools, one of its officialswho was kidnapped nine months ago.   ``We want to appeal to all good forces in Lebanon to help us inour efforts to have Jan Cools released,'' said a statement releasedby the Norwegian Aid Committee at a news conference in west Beirut.   The organization, known as NORWAC, provides humanitarian andmedical support to Palestinians.   Cools, 32, a Belgian physician working with NORWAC, was abdcutedlast May 21 near the southern port city of Tyre after leaving hisclinic in the nearby Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp.
