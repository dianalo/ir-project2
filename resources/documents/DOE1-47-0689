In the earlier post-War years, America was not facedwith substantial numbers of internal critics who felt alienated fromits democratic system;but today it is. And this fact makes it enormouslydifficult to arrive at any consensus about how American foreign policyshould proceed. If the American system is so morally defective, why defendit? And so America's critics are perpetually suspicious of the motivesof its leaders in the foreign arena. Those who feel alienated from Americansociety also tend to attribute benign intent to the Soviet Union, andthis too makes the policy maker's task more difficult than it used tobe. The author holds a position antithetical to the dissidents. He believesthat there is an ineluctable connection between Marxist-Leninist regimesand warlike behavior and intentions. Marxism and militarism, he claims,go hand in hand. In contrast, democratic regimes do not make war on eachother. Wherein, then, lies mankind's hope for avoiding a nuclear war?Principally, the author thinks, in a moral vision which looks to thepluralization of the Soviet Union, not to the weakening of the defensepostures of the democracies. He concludes with two aphorisms: withoutdictatorship there is no war;without democracy there is no peace.</TEXT></DOC>
