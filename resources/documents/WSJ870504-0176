Paul Simon, a liberal Illinois Democrat and presidential aspirant, dispatched a telegram to Attorney General Edwin Meese in January urging further review before Karl Linnas, an accused Nazi war criminal, was deported to the Soviet Union. The lawmaker had been asked by Chicago-area constituents to make sure the government had studied the evidence carefully.    But it was Sen. Simon who hadn't done his homework. He soon learned from the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith that Mr. Linnas had seven judicial hearings over seven years and that a federal judge ruled it was &quot;beyond dispute&quot; that Mr. Linnas had supervised death-camp atrocities in his native Estonia. In March, Sen. Simon did an about-face, telling the league he had decided &quot;not to pursue this matter.&quot; An aide concedes, &quot;Had we had the information, we wouldn't have sent the telegram.&quot;    Sen. Simon was a victim of an intense lobbying effort by a number of East European emigre groups to end the Justice Department's pursuit of Nazi war criminals now living in the U.S. Some groups have civil-liberties concerns. But others are spurred either by strong anti-Soviet feelings, a desire to prevent the resurrection of old ghosts or a tinge of anti-Semitism. And the movement has found an all-American champion in Patrick Buchanan, former White House communications director, who speaks out forcefully on their behalf.    The emigre groups lost a big battle last month when Mr. Linnas became the first accused war criminal to be deported to the Soviet Union. But now, concerned about the Linnas precedent and the deportation to Israel of John Demjanjuk, another accused war criminal, they are gearing up for other fights.    About half of the 27 individuals the U.S. currently wants to deport for lying to immigration officials about their Nazi past when they came here also could be sent to the Soviet Union. Officials estimate there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other war criminals living in the U.S., but because of the lack of strong evidence they estimate conservatively that only about 50 more individuals may be deported.    Operating under such names as Americans for Due Process and Americans Against Defamation of Ukranians, the groups argue that people who are now U.S. citizens shouldn't be subjected to Soviet justice but should be tried here in the U.S. Some also call for a statute of limitations on war crimes, noting that these events took place 40 years ago. Mr. Buchanan has said that Justice Department funds would be better spent pursuing suspects of more recent, domestic crimes.    &quot;As long as the Justice Department was dormant and not taking action, the coalition was quiet,&quot; says Abraham Foxman, the Anti-Defamation League's associate national director. &quot;But now there is an intensity of concern that if the cases continue it may reach out beyond the 12 cases now being considered&quot; involving deportation to the Soviet Union.    Some lobbyists, such as Ojars Kalnins of the American Latvian Association, say that they do want Nazi criminals brought to justice. But he contends, &quot;There are no circumstances under which they should be deported to the Soviet Union. We don't think the Soviets have the moral authority to put anyone on trial for crimes against humanity.&quot;    Others, however, are using this enmity for the Soviets, who gobbled up the Baltic states during World War II, as a smoke screen to protect suspected war criminals and to mobilize the thousands of East European emigres who are clustered in industrial cities such as Chicago, Cleveland and Detroit.    In a December 1984 letter to Secretary of State George Shultz, Eduard Rubel, president of the Captive Nations Committee, complained that the U.S. effort against ex-Nazis is driven by &quot;pressure from Jewish Zionist special interest groups.&quot; He added that &quot;Soviet Jews as a ruling class in the U.S.S.R. were as vicious as the Nazis.&quot;    Other tactics are more subtle. The Joint Baltic American National Committee told Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1984 that the Reagan administration was violating the so-called Captive Nations policy, under which Congress pledged to not deport people to nations absorbed by Moscow. They asked the New York Republican to write to Mr. Shultz. A D'Amato aide says the group never mentioned the Linnas case, but soon began using the letter the senator sent to Mr. Shultz as a show of support for the ex-Nazi. When the senator discovered this, he quickly issued a statement saying he had been &quot;lied to and deceived.&quot;    Mr. Buchanan, the former White House aide and outspoken conservative, argues regularly that war criminals should be &quot;tried right here in America,&quot; where they would get a fair trial, rather than deported to the Soviet Union. He also says he wants to bring such criminals to justice and wouldn't object to deporting them to Western Europe or Israel for trials.    But the U.S. doesn't have laws under which Nazi war criminals can be prosecuted, and most experts agree that it would be extremely difficult under the U.S. Constitution to pass a law and then prosecute people under it for crimes committed 40 years ago. And it was Mr. Buchanan himself who led the charge to block the deportation of Mr. Demjanjuk -- accused of being &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; of Treblinka -- to Israel. In an article in the Washington Post, Mr. Buchanan said Mr. Demjanjuk, &quot;a Church-going family man from Cleveland,&quot; was a victim of a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot; based on phony Soviet evidence.    However, Allan Ryan, who in 1980 became the first director of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, which prosecutes these cases, says the key piece of evidence challenged by Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Demjanjuk's identification card from a Nazi training camp provided by the Soviets, was tested thoroughly for signs of forgery. Mr. Buchanan claims the U.S. received only a copy of the card; Mr. Ryan says the Soviets also sent the original and that Mr. Demjanjuk's attorney never called an expert to the stand to try to refute the evidence.    Elizabeth Holtzman, the former Democratic congresswoman from New York, who authored the legislation creating the Office of Special Investigations, adds that ex-Nazis receive fair and adequate judicial hearings in the U.S. &quot;American courts are perfectly competent to determine the quality of evidence&quot; used in these cases, she says. &quot;Linnas got more judicial proceeding than anyone I prosecute for murder in Brooklyn,&quot; says Ms. Holtzman, who now is the district attorney of Brooklyn.    Yesterday, Mr. Ryan said on ABC's &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot; that following a three-week trial, a federal court &quot;found beyond a reasonable doubt that Linnas had taken part in atrocities&quot; in Estonia during World War II.    Mr. Ryan, who currently is an attorney at Harvard University's General Counsel's office, says that when he started the Justice Department program in 1980 he contacted several emigre groups asking for their cooperation in ridding their communities of the tiny minority involved in war crimes. He says that with the exception of one group, The Polish American Congress, &quot;we got back absolutely nothing but criticism and opposition.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
