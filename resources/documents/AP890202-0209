Though Dennis expressed reservations about the ways telephonecompanies might compete in the cable television arena, she said itwas time to end an era of ``television of scarcity'' in which a fewcompanies offer a limited amount of programming.   She said she looked forward to the day when Americans will haveaccess to an unlimited number of two-way or ``interactive''entertainment, educational and communications signals carried intotheir homes by lasers on telephone fiber optic cables.   ``It is my job to think about what kind of networks we want forthe future,'' she told a luncheon audience at Federal CommunicationsCommmission headquarters. ``What kinds of demands are reallyultimately going to be placed on a telephone network or cable systemwhich starts providing two-way interactive (services)? And I don'tthink that we can seriously say it's going to be plain ol' voice(telephones) any longer.''   She said regulations must be structured ``so that this cornucopiaof services will blossom _ just not video programming and video ondemand but interactive services for educational purposes, medicalpurposes.''   The FCC voted tentatively last year to seek public comment on apossible recommendation that Congress allow telephone companies toenter the cable TV business, repealing laws that ban such entry.   Dennis said it was important to make sure that telephonecompanies would not be able to use their enormous resources tosqueeze cable operators out of the market, either through exclusiveprogramming or by simply buying up the competition.   Telephone companies should be required to build cable systems,and thus they would utilize the potential of fiber optics, she said.   Also, if phone companies are allowed to provide their ownprogramming, she said, they must be required to carry othercompanies' programs for reasonable fees.   She advocated an approach in which cable programming ``stores''would pay to have their products displayed in phone company``shopping malls.''   ``We've got a store right now, and that store is operated by thecable company and they decide what products go in and where theshelf will be and who gets to be the providers of services withinthat store,'' she said.   ``What I would like to see is just not another competing storewith the telephone companies offering video services but perhaps ashopping mall opened up. That's what fiber really allows us to dobecause it has such high capacity. If the telephone companies comein as common carriers then lots of stores will be able to occupyspace in that shopping mall and the consumer will be better offbecause then the consumer will have an abundance of choice,'' Dennissaid.   She said a major issue was whether or not the phone companies gotto open their own ``store'' in the ``shopping mall'' and offer theirproducts and programs over their telephone lines.   She said if the phone companies operate the mall _ the phonelines _ ``and they've also got a store they might turn off thelights for everybody else and keep only their light on so that's theonly one that the consumers would have access to.''   Another concern was cross-subsidization in which telephonecompanies would use telephone revenues to finance cable operations,or vice versa. She said telephone users shouldn't have to pay more.   She said of Congress, ``If we can set the landscape and carefullystructure it so that the twin evils of discrimination andcross-subsidization are avoided or are at least contained well, thenthey will listen. I`m hopeful that we will get a very goodreception.''</TEXT></DOC>
