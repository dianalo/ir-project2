Andrei D. Sakharov, the human rights activist and Nobel Peacelaureate, branded it ``one of the great tragedies of our times.''   Costly in lives, money and Soviet prestige, the Kremlin'smilitary intervention in Afghanistan has become a national trauma.   With the stroke of a pen in Geneva today, the Soviet Unioncommitted itself to withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan, butthat can't remove all the shadows cast over Soviet diplomacy andpeoples' lives.   By agreeing to pull out forces sent into Afghanistan beginningDec. 27, 1979, to replace one pro-Marxist regime with another, theSoviets _ like the Americans in Vietnam _ have acknowledged theirinability to keep bearing the human and diplomatic costs of ananti-guerrilla war in a foreign land.   But while the Red Army may end its engagement, few expect thefighting to cease outright. And there are indications the Sovietsmay continue shipping weapons to their former comrades in armsafter their estimated 115,000 troops return home.   The Red Army has been on the ground in Afghanistan for more thaneight years, more than twice as long as it took the Soviets inWorld War II to drive the invading German armies back to Berlin.   Thousands of young Soviet men have been killed in the Afghanfighting, thousands more wounded, and billions of rubles pouredinto the war and accompanying efforts to make mountainous andunderdeveloped Afghanistan into a socialist country.   This year the Soviets abandoned any pretense of seeking todefine their neighbor's future, with Gorbachev saying on Feb. 8that the political and economic system of Afghanistan is ``none ofour business.''   The drive into Afghanistan, launched when the late Leonid I.Brezhnev was in power in the Soviet Union, poisoned the Kremlin'srelations with other Moslem and Third World countries and doomeddetente between the superpowers.   From the U.S. withdrawal of the SALT II arms control treaty andthe boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics by the United States and 61other nations to the canceling of grain and other trade agreementsinvolving foreign suppliers, the Soviets paid the price for sendingtanks and troops across the Afghan border.   Last November at the U.N. General Assembly, 123 nations, thelargest total to date, voted for a resolution calling for theimmediate and total withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan.   ``The main question about Afghanistan is not the truth about thehorrors and the deaths, but why are we there?'' one Soviet warveteran wrote in the weekly magazine Ogonyok last year.   Many Soviets say that question has never been answered.   ``Afghanistan is one of the great tragedies of our times thathas caused a worsening in international relations, led to the deathof many people and created a foyer of tension in the world,''Sakharov said in February.   A Moscow newspaper editor recently told a Western reporter ofreceiving a letter from a man whose only son was killed inAfghanistan. ``Now the others are coming home,'' the writer of theletter said. ``But what did my boy die for?''   The editor said he anguished over how to reply, and confessed,``I have a stack of those letters on my desk, and I must answereach one. But I don't know what to say.''   Gorbachev said in February that the ``memory of those who havedied a hero's death in Afghanistan is sacred to us,'' and thatSoviet soldiers sent there ``have been performing their dutyhonestly, performing acts of self-denial and heroism.''   In recent weeks, state-run media have issued gloomy andpessimistic reports on Afghanistan, presumably to prepare Sovietcitizens for continued strife there, and the media has accusedMoslem guerrillas of accelerating fighting in that country's10-year-old civil war just as chances for peace improve.   ``Terror on the eve of settlement,'' was the headline on oneTass news agency dispatch this week, which accused the guerrillasfighting the Soviet-backed government of President Najib of``planting mines'' on the road to a peaceful settlement.   Under the agreement negotiated at the U.N.-sponsored talks inGeneva, Soviet troops are to begin their march home May 15 in apullout to be completed within nine months. All should be back homeby the end of the year, Soviet officials have said privately.   Under Gorbachev's campaign for more openness, Soviet newspapersand television have become more frank about the hardships faced bysoldiers sent to Afghanistan, and by returning veterans who meetwith official indifference or hostility.   However, the horrors of the fighting in Afghanistan, whichWestern sources say has resulted in up to 1 million civilian deathsand 5 million refugees, have only been spottily reported in Sovietmedia.   The Soviet people have never been told how many of their sonshave been killed or wounded in the war, and officials refuse to saypublicly even how many Soviet troops are deployed.   The U.S. State Department has estimated Soviet casualties since1979 at 33,000-38,000, more than one-third of whom were killed.Those figures do not include ``heavy losses'' to disease, thedepartment said in a report issued in December.   Reluctance to admit the full tragedy of the war, and the scopeof Kremlin involvement, exists throughout Soviet society.   Graves of slain soldiers do not specify they were killed inAfghanistan, some parents have publicly complained, and governmentspokesman continue to refer to the conflict as ``the situationaround Afghanistan,'' rather than a war.   In November, a veteran writing in Ogonyok urged Sovietjournalists to be forthright and ``call a dirty war a dirty war.''   The Kremlin's current plans for Afghanistan are uncertain. OnWednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said that underthe accords reached in Geneva, the United States would continueaiding the Afghan rebels if the Soviets supply weapons to Najib'sgovernment.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev said on Tuesday theSoviet Union hopes chances for peace in Afghanistan ``will continueto evolve positively, and we hope the issue of arms supplies willnot remain long on the agenda.''</TEXT></DOC>
