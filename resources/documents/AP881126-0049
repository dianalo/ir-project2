Gorbachev today convened ameeting of the country's highest executive body to considerEstonia's challenge to centralized Kremlin controls, Tass reported.   The official news agency said the Presidium of the Supreme Sovietwas to discuss proposed constitutional amendments that have drawnstrong opposition in the Baltic republic of Estonia and other Sovietrepublics. Gorbachev is chairman of the executive body.   The Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, is to meet Tuesdayto consider amendments that would establish a Council of People'sDeputies, which would elect a legislature and a president withenhanced powers.   On Nov. 16, Estonia's Supreme Soviet denounced the changes thatwould centralize power and passed a ``declaration of sovereignty''in all areas but defense and foreign policy. It also approved anamendment to the republic's constitution requiring Estonian approvalof all new Soviet laws.   Official Radio Moscow said today's session will consider theconstitutionality of Estonia's action.   On Nov. 19, two national parliamentary commissions found thedeclarations to be at odds with the Soviet Constitution, and passedits recommendations on to the Presidium.   The policy-making Communist Party Central Committee is to meetMonday to consider the issue in preparation for the Soviet Supremesession, Tass said.   The constitutional amendments proposed by Gorbachev face strongopposition not only in Estonia, but also in the two other Balticrepublics of Latvia and Lithuania.   Baltic activists, who are pushing for greater political, culturaland economic autonomy under the banner of Gorbachev's reforms, saythe constitutional amendments would take away some of their powerrather than grant them greater local control.   Activists in the southern republics of Georgia and Armenia saythe legislatures there also have rejected the amendments.   The Kremlin has expressed a willingness to compromise on theissue.   Earlier this week, a legislative panel recommended that theproposed Council of People's Deputies not be given power to throwout laws adopted by the republics. On Thursday, the ruling CommunistParty Politburo noted that the bills could be ``substantiallyimproved.''   Radio Moscow said the Presidium received 200,000 letters aboutthe amendments. It said most exprssed approval, but many suggestedchanges.   ``As a result, many provisions have been improved,'' Radio Moscowsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
