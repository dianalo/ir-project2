In a class-action suit here, a federal judge ruled that undocumented workers can't be fired from their jobs solely because they obtained work using false Social Security numbers, provided that the workers are eligible for legalization under the Immigration Reform and Control Act. The judge said such firing constitutes unlawful discrimination under the new law.    The ruling, by U.S. District Court Judge Gabrielle McDonald, is the first to test the anti-discrimination provisions of the new immigration law. The Pasadena (Texas) Independent School District, which fired the women, said it doesn't plan to appeal, giving the ruling immediate, rather than potential, significance.    &quot;The message is that employers should think twice -- and be very careful -- in taking any kind of action against a worker if the worker appears to qualify for legalization,&quot; said Isaias Torres, who argued the case for the four women and for the League of United Latin American Citizens, which was also a plaintiff. &quot;This bolsters the ability of aliens to qualify for legalization,&quot; he said.    The ruling also brings some peace of mind to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant workers who obtained jobs with false documents to &quot;prove&quot; the legality of their presence in the U.S. &quot;I wanted to hug the judge,&quot; said 46-year-old Maria Garza, who brought the suit after being fired along with the other three in February. &quot;I have such a love for this great moment that God gave me.&quot;    But the case also illustrates the extent of the confusion over the complexities of the new immigration law. The act provides for a general legalization for illegal immigrants who can prove they lived in the U.S. before Jan. 1, 1982. It also slaps fines on employers who knowingly hired illegal immigrants after Nov. 6, 1986.    Virtually every employer in the U.S. is affected by the law, which requires the employers to request documentation of newly hired workers as proofs of their citizenship or legal residency. Under a &quot;grandfather clause&quot; of the new law, employers aren't subject to citations or fines if they hired illegal immigrant workers before President Reagan signed the law Nov. 6.    Nevertheless, many employers have become fearful of retaining illegal immigrants who may now qualify for legal residency. Moreover, legalization applications aren't being accepted until May 5. Meanwhile, workers' inability to prove they are eligible for legalization is causing confusion and even firings by employers, from the Jackson Heights community of illegal Colombian immigrants in New York to the barrios of &quot;Little Central America&quot; in Los Angeles.    Because of this ambiguity, &quot;the plaintiffs are in the proverbial position of being between a rock and a hard place,&quot; Judge McDonald said. &quot;I can't imagine a more abominable situation.&quot; As for firing workers who have used false documents, but who may later qualify for legalization, she said, &quot;I can't imagine more of a perversion of the intent of the statute.&quot;    The school district in Pasadena, a blue-collar city of refineries adjacent to Houston, said it learned from a fifth employee, also an illegal resident, that the women had used false Social Security numbers on their job applications. The district said it would fire the women if they didn't produce valid Social Security cards within five days.    After their dismissals, the workers sued under a section of the new law that prohibits employment discrimination based on national origin or citizenship. (Unlike some other portions, this section of the law has already taken effect.) Mr. Torres argued that because false Social Security cards are used in the school district primarily by undocumented Hispanic workers, the women had been discriminated against according to ethnicity. He further noted that the anti-discrimination provisions cover &quot;intended citizens&quot; and that the four workers fell under this rubric because of their plans for legalization.    The workers' case was bolstered by expert testimony from Leonel Castillo, a former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, who said that 90% of undocumented workers rely on false Social Security numbers. &quot;Congress couldn't have intended for them to be fired when they came forward to reveal their status&quot; to apply for legalization, Mr. Torres said.    One worker nearly gave up the fight before it was won. Thirty-two-year-old Maria Olympia Hernandez said she was ready to return to her native El Salvador despite the civil war raging there.&quot;My mother said, 'Hija, vente' (Daughter, come back.) But my children cried and said they didn't want to return.&quot;    The four plantiffs were awarded job reinstatement and back pay of about $1,500 each.    Kirk Lewis, a school district administrator, said the district had no idea the case would entangle it in the nation's new immigration law. Mr. Lewis said officials didn't view the dismissals as discriminatory. &quot;We did not at any time go looking for undocumented aliens working for us,&quot; he said. Instead, he said, the district was only trying to enforce its policy that no employee -- &quot;including the superintendent&quot; -- may provide false information on an employment application.    This wasn't the first time that the 35-year-old Mr. Torres and the Pasadena schools have squared off over illegal immigration. In 1981, he successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court that the children of illegal immigrants in the school districts of Pasadena and Houston had the right to a public education.    The latest case is part of a national effort by League of United Latin American Citizens and other civil and immigrant rights groups to document alleged employment discrimination under the new law. The groups' aim is to repeal the section of the new law providing for sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.    In a lawsuit in a Sacramento, Calif., federal court, advocacy groups last month obtained the agreement of the INS to allow illegal employees to work while their legal status is being ruled upon. An INS spokesman yesterday characterized the suit as &quot;frivolous,&quot; and said the agency, in any case, was planning to notify employers that they wouldn't be fined if employees signed statements saying that they are eligible for legalization.    For this group of workers, the INS said, employer sanctions won't go into effect until Sept. 1. Otherwise, employer sanctions go into effect June 1. </TEXT></DOC>
