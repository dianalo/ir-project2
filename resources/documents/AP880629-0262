The arrest of Colin Breeze has apparently ended attempts to lureother conspirators into the country, said Patrick O'Brien, head ofthe U.S. Customs Service here. But he said agents suspect theoperation was part of a larger network.   ``We are continuing the investigation to look for diversions ofmilitary equipment to Iran,'' O'Brien said, but refused to giveother details.   Breeze, a 33-year-old British citizen, was held without bond inthe Metropolitan Correctional Center south of here after thefederal government declared him a risk of flight.   He is accused of trying to smuggle 10 Sikorsky S-36 helicoptersto Iran by arranging to have them sold to a European companysecretly owned by the Iranian government, O'Brien said.   U.S. law forbids exporting arms without a permit.   Iran's ambassador to Spain was helping arrange the deal andintended to take a cut from the $30 million sale to his owngovernment, said O'Brien.   The 10 Sikorsky helicopters were originally sold to theJordanian air force in 1979 and 1980. Six were later traded back toSikorsky but remained in Jordan, and all 10 were for sale at$675,000 each.   Sikorsky spokesman Bob Stangarone in Stratford, Conn., confirmedthat the company owned the six helicopters but said it had neverdealt with Breeze.   ``The S-36 is a military-type helicopter,'' said O'Brien. ``Theyare basically a troop carrier, a civilian version of the Blackhawk.These things are great over the desert.''   In May, the affidavit said, Breeze approached a confidentialinformant for the Customs service about buying the helicopters forIran. The informant advised Customs and coversations between thetwo were taped by authorities.   In the conversations, some of which took place in Spain and somein the United Kingdom, Breeze told the informant the ultimatepurchaser was Iran.   ``Breeze further advised that negotiations for the purchase werebeing conducted through a Spanish national middleman and theIranian embassy in Madrid,'' Customs agent Thomas Bailey said inthe affidavit.   Last week, Breeze told the informant that the sales agreementwas on its way by diplomatic pouch from Madrid to Iran for finalapproval. But he later said it was held up because the ambassadorwas insisting on a larger share of the profits.   ``Frankly, it's standard in these Iranian cases,'' said O'Brien.``They raise their price at the last minute.''   Breeze was arrested Tuesday at the Fort Lauderdale airportbecause authorities were afraid he was about to leave the country.He was taken before a U.S. magistrate and was scheduled for a fullhearing Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
