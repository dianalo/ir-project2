 The printouts,however, lend new meaning to the word &quot;austere.&quot;andM;On the other hand, your word processor is loaded with formatting and layoutpower, but doesn't have the aptitude for complex financial modeling.andM;In the past, the none-too-elegant solution often was to calculate, thenumbers with the spreadsheet, then rekey them into a word-processingdocument.andM;With 5.1, you can now enjoy the best of both worlds.andP;  It incorporates directlinks into Lotus 1-2-3-as well as many other spreadsheets.andP;  The spreadsheetcalculates the numerical data, then WordPerfect directly links into thisdata, neatly importing it into polished, presentation-quality documents.andM;This article shows how to use 5.1 to create and use a link to a Lotus 1 -2 -3spreadsheet.andP;  I'll assume you know the basics of 1-2-3, but not much more.andO;First, I'll describe the sample spreadsheet, then the final WordPerfectdocument.andP;  The remainder of the article details the procedures involved inlinking.andP;  The spreadsheetandM;Figure 1 is a spreadsheet, BUDGET.WKl, used to calculate the 1991 OperatingBudget for ABC Industries.andP;  The company has two divisions: Manufacturing andMarketing.andP;  The spreadsheet has both a summary area and individual data entryareas for the two divisions.andM;Formulas in rows 6, 13 and 20 total the three cells immediately above.andP;  Forinstance, the formula in Cell B6 reads: andlsqb;@andrsqb;SUM(B3..B5).andP;  Formulas in Column Ftotal the four cells to the immediate left.andP;  The formula in Cell F3 reads:andlsqb;@andrsqb;SUM(B3..E3).andP;  Formulas in the range B3..E5, which is the combining area ofthe spreadsheet, take the sum of the two corresponding cells in thedivisional areas below.andP;  For example, the formula in Cell B3 reads: andlsqb;andplus;andrsqb;B10andlsqb;andplus;andrsqb;B17.andM;In addition to the formula structure, the spreadsheet also includes threerange names.andP;  Range names are highly useful in that they allow you to assigneasily recognizable names to various areas of the spreadsheet.andP;  You create arange name in Lotus with the /Range Name Create command.andP;  When the command/RNC is entered, Lotus first asks you to enter the desired range name.andP;  Next,you use the cursor keys to highlight the area that name will designate.andM;The names and cell coordinates for the range names used in this spreadsheetare: COMB andequals; B3..F6, MANU andequals; B10..F13 and MARKET B17..F20.andM;These ranges designate the numeric data export areas for the combined dataarea and the data areas for the two individual divisions.andM;To keep things simple, I'm only going to import the combined data area.andO;Having three range names in the sheet makes it clearer how to select from thelist of range names displayed during the link-creation process.andP;  The reportandM;Figure 2 presents the final form of the budget summary report I've got oneorganizational point to touch on, then we'D get right into the hands-on.andO;I'll assume you've created BUDGET.WK1 shown in Figure 1 and that it's savedin a subdirectory called C:\LOTUS\BUDGET.andM;Run WordPerfect and press Font (Ctrl-F8), (4) Base Font.andP;  Select a Helvetica14-point bold font if you have it, or some other suitable headline font ifyou don't Press Center  (Shift-F6) and type ABC Industries Combined 1991Operating Budget.andM;Press (Enter) three times to add some space before the divider line.andP;  PressGraphics  (Alt-F9), (5) Line, (1) Horizontal, (1) Horizontal Position, (3)Center.andP;  Next, press (3) Length of Line, type 5&quot; and press (Enter).andP;  Exit F7) to the document screen.andP;  Note.andP;  You won't see the line until you Print (Shift-F7) the document.andP;  Press (Enter) three times to move to the beginningof the text paragraph.andP;  Press Font  (Ctrl-F8), (4) Base Font and select aTimes Roman 12-point font.andP;  Type some narrative text such as 7*e table belowpresents the combined budgets ...andP;  etc.andP;  See Figure 2 for the completesuggested text.andM;Once the descriptive paragraph is entered, press (Enter) three times to getto the position for the second divider line.andP;  Press Graphics  (Alt-F9) andrepeat the steps you used to create the first divider line.andP;  When finished,press (Enter) three times and you're positioned to start the table.andP;  ThetableandM;WordPerfect will import material from a spreadsheet into either a regulartext area or a table.andP;  For spreadsheets containing mostly numbers, tableimports provide greater control.andP;  In addition, the Tables feature has apowerful array of formatting tools.andP;  When linking a spreadsheet to a table,you can either create the table first and then the link, or let the linkingprocess create the table for you.andP;  Since this table will be larger and havemore formatting than the spreadsheet range you're creating, create the tablefirst.andP;  One thing to remember about this method: The linking process destroysany formatting in the cells linked to the spreadsheet  Therefore, put all ofthe formatting codes, such as fonts, before the linked cells.andM;Press Columns/Table  (Alt-F7), (2) Tables and (1) Create.andP;  Enter 6 for thenumber of columns and 6 for the number of rows.andP;  WordPerfect sets up a newtable structure and leaves you in Table Edit mode.andP;  If you look at Figure 2,you'll see it's necessary to join the top row of cells together.andP;  With thecursor in Cell Al, press Block  (Alt-F4), (End).andP;  Now, with the top rowhighlighted, press (7) join,  (Y) Yes.andP;  The top row of the table is now asingle cell.andM;Next, modify the lines that make up the table.andP;  With the cursor in Cell A1,press (3) Lines, (4) Bottom, (3) Double.andP;  Then press Block  (Alt-F4), (Home),(Down Arrow) to highlight the entire table.andP;  Press (3) Lines, (6) Outside,(2) Single.andP;  Me original double-line outer border is now single, and yourcursor is in Cell A6.andM;The next step is to set the column widths.andP;  First press (6) Options, (3)Position of Table, (3) Center.andP;  This keeps the table centered regardless ofwhat we do with individual column widths.andP;  Press Exit  F7) to return to TableEdit mode.andP;  Changing column widthsandM;There are two methods for changing column widths.andP;  You can use (Ctrl) plusthe arrow keys to adjust widths, or you can enter a width in inches.andP;  Forthis example, use the latter method.andP;  With the cursor anywhere in the firstcolumn, press (2) Format, (2) Column, (1) Width.andP;  Type 1&quot; and press (Enter).andO;This sets the width of Column A to one inch for your labels.andP;  To set thewidth of the numeric columns as a group, press (Right Arrow) to move toColumn B and press Block  (Alt-F4), (End) to select the five columns.andP;  Press(2) Format, (2) Column, (1) Width and enter a width of  9'.andP;  Finally, rightjustify the cells for the column captions and numeric data.andP;  Move the cursorto Cell B2 and press Block  (Alt-F4), (Home), (Home), (Down Arrow), (2)Format, (1) Cell, (3) Justify and (3) Right.andM;Press Exit  (F7) to leave Table Edit mode.andP;  Move your cursor to Cell Al.andO;Press Font  (Ctrl-F8), (4) Base Font and select a Helvetica 12-point boldfont.andP;  Press Center  (Shift-F6) and type ABC Industries Combined 1991Operating Budget.andP;  Press (Tab) twice to move the cursor to Cell B2.andP;  PressFont (Ctrl-F8), (4) Base Font and select a Times Roman 8-point font Type 1stQuarter and press Screen (Ctrl-F3), (3) Rewrite to redraw the screen.andP;  Note:If you're using a different font and the line wraps, widen the columns alittle.andP;  To do so, press Columns/Table  (AltF7) to enter Table Edit mode,place your cursor in the column you wish to widen and press  (Ctrl-RightArrow) until it is wide enough.andP;  Press Exit  F7) to return to the documentscreen.andP;  Enter the rest of the column headings as they appear in Figure 2.andM;One last step, then you're ready to create the direct link to BUDGET.WK1.andO;Press  (Tab) until the cursor is in Cell A3.andP;  Type Administration.andP;  Press(Down Arrow) and enter the other labels as they appear in Figure 2.andP;  The linkandM;Now you're ready for the fink.andP;  Press (Tab) until the cursor is in Cell B3.andO;Remember that this cell corresponds to the upper-left cell in the range namedCOMB in your spreadsheet Press Text In/Out  (Ctrl-F5), (5) Spreadsheet, (2)Create Link and (1) Filename.andP;  Type c:\lotus\budget\budget.wk1 and press(Enter).andP;  Note: You can specify a default directory for your spreadsheetfiles in Setup ((Shift-F1), (6) Location of Files.andM;Next, select (2) Range.andP;  Press List F5), and a list of all the named rangesin your spreadsheet will appear.andP;  In this case, you should at least see COMB,MANU and MARKET.andP;  Highlight COMB and press (Enter).andP;  Now for the grandfinale.andP;  Press (4) Perform Link.andP;  WordPerfect will locate the targetspreadsheet locate the target range name, extract the cell contents andtransfer them to the table.andP;  The numbers retain the formats-such as decimalplaces, commas and so forth-they had in the spreadsheet.andM;As a last touch, the WordPerfect document can be set to update the fink everytime the document is loaded.andP;  Press Text In/Out  (Ctrl-F5), (5) Spreadsheet,(4) link Options, (1) Update on Retrieve and choose (Y) Yes.andP;  Now each timethe document is loaded it will automatically refresh all the numbers thatoriginated in the spreadsheetandM;WordPerfect's Link feature has brought the world of numbers to the world ofhigh-quality printouts.andP;  Now the numbers game will never be the same.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
