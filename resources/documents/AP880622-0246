Johannes Basson, 25, identified by Botswanan police as a SouthAfrican army corporal, and Theodore Hermansen, 30, said to be aSouth African police or army reservist, were charged in amagistrate's court with endangering Botswana's security, committinggrievous bodily harm and attempting to cause death.   They were denied bail and will be held in police custody for twoweeks until their next court appearance.   The South African military said an army unit crossed intoBotswana Monday night on an intelligence mission linked to effortsto combat the outlawed African National Congress. It did notelaborate.   The ANC is a black guerrilla movement fighting to topple SouthAfrica's white minority government because of its policies ofracial separation, or apartheid.   The South African military has neither confirmed nor denied thatthe two arrested men are security force members. It has admittedits unit fired shots at a Botswanan police patrol but said the unitfired only after the police shot first.   Botswana's police commissioner, Simon Hirschfeldt, insisted theBotswanan police were unarmed. He said police in Botswana do notcarry arms on routine patrols and his men could not have fired``with empty hands.''   Three Botswanan policemen were injured in the shooting incident.Hirschfeldt said one was in critical condition after being hit by10 bullets.   Botswana says five other South African commandos who fired theshots escaped back into South Africa. The two arrested menattempted a getaway in two Botswana police cars and were arrestedat a roadblock, police said.   South African commandos have staged numerous border raids in thepast on suspected ANC facilities in Botswana and neighboringcountries. In none of the previous raids have any commandos beencaptured.   The U.S. Embassy issued a statement Wednesday condemning theSouth African raid. ``By firing on and wounding unarmed policemen,the South African government has once again shown its disregard forinternational law,'' the statement said.   At the United Nations Wednesday, Botswana's Ambassador JosephLegwaila said he will seek a meeting of the Security Council tocondemn the incident.   The ambassador said Botswana has been plagued by raids fromSouth Africa because it supports the African National Congress.``Botswana is and will always remain a friend of the ANC and anenemy of South Africa,'' he said.   Government-run Radio South Africa said Wednesday that 23 AfricanNational Congress guerrillas who were recently captured in SouthAfrica between June 10 and 13 had received their instructions andweapons in Botswana.</TEXT></DOC>
