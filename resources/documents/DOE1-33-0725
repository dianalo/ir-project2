The resultsshow that the leader initiated by first corona is random, and the inceptionprobability (P/sub L/) increases with the increment of radii of HV sphereelectrodes and is influenced by the rise rate of impulse voltages. Thereis a transition region between P/sub L/ = 0% and P/sub L/ = 100%. 8 references,6 figures, 3 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
