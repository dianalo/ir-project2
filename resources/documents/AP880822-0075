The death toll was expected to climb from Sunday's pre-dawnquake on the India-Nepal border, which triggered landslides andfloods and was the mountainous region's deadliest in 38 years.   Officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reportsfrom the remote Himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor, whichknocked out power and communications and was said to injure atleast 3,000 people.   Niranjan Thapa, Nepal's minister of state for home affairs, tolda news conference at least 450 were dead and up to 1,000 injured.He said officials expected the numbers to climb.   Indian officials reported at least 200 people dead and more than2,000 injured, most by debris from collapsing buildings.   The quake, centered almost on the India-Nepal border, registered6.5 on the Richter scale.   Indian television today showed the devastation in the Indianstate of Bihar: crumbled buildings, makeshift morgues lined withrows of bodies wrapped in white shrouds, damaged hospital wardspacked with survivors.   Medical teams in India carried medicine and other supplies toovercrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search forvictims.   But the monsoons, which hit the subcontinent in late June andusually last through September, hampered relief operations.   Nepal's Thapa told a news conference that ``the rains have beena great hindrance in carrying out rescue works. Access to someareas of this mountain country is impossible.''   He said 21 of the kingdom's 75 districts suffered extensivedamage. The hardest hit appeared to be Dharan, a sparsely populatedborder region where Thapa said at least 131 people died.   Bir Bahadur Shahi, secretary of the home affairs ministry, flewto eastern Nepal on Sunday. He said 50,000 to 60,000 houses weredestroyed in the Dharan district alone.   ``Ninety percent of the remaining houses are cracked,'' Shahisaid, adding that most of the damage was to modern houses of stoneand older houses from mud and bricks. Wooden houses were notaffected, he said.   Many people were given shelter in schools, guesthouses andpublic buildings, ``but most of the people do not want to leavetheir homes,'' Shahi said. He said water supplies were stilladequate and there were no reports of disease breaking out.   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi flew to Bihar to tour some of thehardest hit areas. The government said it would release a detailedreport after he returned to the capital tonight.   Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha of Nepal visited someof the victims at Bir Hospital in his capital, Katmandu.   The quake roused people from their sleep in Bihar and nine otherIndian states and central and eastern Nepal. It lasted about aminute and aftershocks continued for about an hour.   Rail tracks sank into the soggy ground and bridges over risingrivers cracked, paralyzing train service and road travel in manyparts of the devastated areas.   Parts of northern Bangladesh and the capital, Dhaka, also feltthe tremor. There were reports that 50 people were injured, most byjumping from their houses during the quake.   Witnesses in Darbhanga, an Indian city of 800,000 about 45 milessouth of the epicenter, said the only warnings were hissing sounds,rattling doors and cracking windows. Women began blowing conchshells, following an ancient tradition believed to appease theweather gods.   More than 25,000 houses were flattened in Darbhanga, as well asthe districts of Munger and Madhubani, Indian officials said.   In Madhubani, the Bhootahi Balan River jumped its banks andflooded nearly 50 villages. Officials said at least 45 people died,but it was not known whether the deaths were due to floods orcollapsing houses.   It was the worst quake to strike the region in 38 years. Atemblor rumbled through the Indian state of Assam on theIndia-China border in August 1950. Official accounts said more than1,500 people died, but seismologists said their records showed30,000 were killed.   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by anearthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.Every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 timesgreater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage inpopulated areas.</TEXT></DOC>
