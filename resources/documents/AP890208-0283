Now, theU.S. company wants to break ties with a town that has become asymbol of white racism.   A cordial corporate relationship with Boksburg, site of Colgate'slarge manufacturing complex, soured in November after newly electedright-wing town councilors decided to resegegrate parks and otherpublic facilities, which had been open to all races under an earlierliberalization.   Colgate joined other businesses in protesting the action, andwent one step further. The company has requested its property beincorporated into the neighboring town of Benoni so it no longerwill pay taxes to Boksburg.   The town council's actions ``are an insult to the dignity of ournon-white workers and contrary to all human rights,'' said GerryNocker, Colgate's chief executive in South Africa. ``We cannotjustify the payment of rates and taxes to a town council that hassuch backward views.''   Nocker, a 47-year-old native of Scotland, said about 750 people,70 percent of them black or mixed-race, work at the factory and pumproughly $6 million of annual wages into the local economy.   Officials in Benoni are studying Colgate's application. If theyformally endorse it, a final decision would be made by theadministrator of Transvaal Province.   The Chemical Workers Industrial Union, which represents most ofColgate's black employees, describes the company proposal as apublic relations gesture that contrasts with a ``long and difficultrelationship'' between management and workers.   But Nocker says Colgate's opposition to South Africa's apartheidpolicies extends beyond criticism of the Boksburg councilors. Henoted that the company financed a recent independent study of theGroup Areas Act which urged the abolition of laws mandatingresidential segregation.   The Boksburg controversy marks the second time this year thatColgate, one of the biggest U.S. multinationals, has taken actionover a race-related issue outside the United States.   In January the company said it would change the name of its``Darkie'' toothpaste, sold by a Hong Kong subsidiary in Asia, to``Darlie'' and substitute a picture of a grinning black minstrel onthe tube to a ``non-racially offensive silhouette.''   At Colgate's international headquarters in New York, an executivesaid the company's influential position in Boksburg has justifiedthe decision to stay in South Africa despite disinvestment pressurefrom anti-apartheid activists. About 175 U.S. firms have pulled outsince 1983, while 138 remain.   ``As long as we can make a noise and contribute to preventingthis kind of retrogressive step, then we think it's very importantthat we and other American companies retain a presence there,'' saidGavin Anderson, director of executive services.   The Conservative Party councilors who took power in Boksburg onOct. 26 remain committed to whites-only amenities despite a blackconsumer boycott that began in mid-December and harsh criticism frombusiness groups, the press and the governing National Party.   Both the Conservatives and anti-apartheid politicians to the leftof the National Party have accused the government of hypocrisy,noting that it has made no move to repeal the law that allowssegregation of local facilities.   Adrian Botha, executive director the American Chamber of Commercein South Africa, said his organization supported Colgate's attemptto disavow Boksburg but felt the government bore responsibility.   ``The Conservative Party is acting quite legally,'' Botha said.``The fault lies with people who introduced those laws.''   Anderson said Colgate hadn't decided on its strategy if theBenoni proposal fails, but he indicated the factory is unlikely tobe relocated.   ``Ours is not a business like a shop that you can pick up andmove to the next town,'' he said.   Colgate began marketing soaps, shaving cream and toothpaste inSouth Africa in 1929, opened a factory in East London in 1937, andmoved in 1958 to Boksburg, about 15 miles east of Johannesburg.   Boksburg's town clerk, Johan Coetsee, said the council hadn't yetdiscussed the Colgate application to be incorporated into Benoni. Hesaid the maneuver could prove impossible, partly because Boksburgprovides Colgate's factory with electricity, water and sewageservice.   The company's public affairs director, Sylvia Hayward, saysColgate has been ``chipping away at apartheid'' through variousprograms, including financial aid for aspiring black entrepreneurs,multiracial private schools and a mobile denistry clinic.   Assessing the Boksburg controversy, Nocker said the towncouncilors ``are really turning the clock back. I can't imagine thekind of thinking that goes on at those council meetings.''</TEXT></DOC>
