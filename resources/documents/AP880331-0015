The call for strict international controls onchlorofluourocarbons, or CFCs, is coming from senators, scientistsand two quarters that often are in deep disagreement:environmentalists and chemical companies.   ``We need a massive diplomatic mission,'' Sen. John Chafee,R-R.I., said Wednesday as two Environment Committee subcommitteesheard renewed warnings that CFC's are depleting the ozone thatshields humans from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.   Committee members and witnesses took turns saying that theUnited States must take the lead to push other industrializednations into taking stronger measures against CFCs than containedin last year's Montreal Protocol.   That agreement could lead to a freeze on global CFC productionin 1999 at a level of 50 percent of the CFCs manufactured in 1986.To take effect, the protocol needs ratification by nationsrepresenting two-thirds of CFC production. So far, only the UnitedStates and Mexico have acted.   CFCs are widely used as refrigerants and industrial solvents andin the production of foam products. They also serve as propellantsin aerosol cans, although such use was banned in the United Statesin 1977.   Witnesses said the administration should not only be pushing forratification but also be lobbying for an emergency internationalgathering to consider a larger production freeze or even a ban onCFCs.   The protocol provides for a CFC review meeting sometime in 1990.Lee Thomas, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,said Tuesday he would press to have that meeting very early in 1990.   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., called on President Reagan to make anaccelerated schedule for CFC reductions a priority item this Junewhen he and leaders of other industrialized democracies hold theirannual economic summit.   Also calling for faster action was Sherwood Rowland, theUniversity of California-Irvine professor who in the 1970s was oneof the first scientists to warn of dangers posed by CFCs.   ``Clearly the protocol is not going to do much of anything for10 years,'' Rowland said. ``We need more rapid action than that.''   David Doniger, senior attorney for the environmentalist NaturalResources Defense Council, said a swift international response isneeded in light of the conclusion announced March 15 by a panel of100 scientists convened by the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration.   The panel said ozone depletion is occurring faster thanpreviously thought. Doniger said the losses cited by the panelalready are at levels EPA has projected for the year 2050 under theproduction cuts specified by the Montreal protocol.   ``I think we can attain a new worldwide agreement in a year andend the use of these chemicals by the end of the century,'' Donigersaid.   Joining the call for a stepped-up diplomatic effort wererepresentatives of two major U.S. producers of CFCs, E.I. DuPont DeNemours andamp; Co., and Allied-Signal Inc.   ``All of us need to work to get as many nations as possible toratify the protocol as quickly as possible,'' said MarilynMontgomery, vice president and general manager of Allied-Signal'sGenetron Products.   Elwood Blanchard, DuPont's executive vice president, said hiscompany believes that CFC-producing countries should be convened assoon as possible ``to review the scientific findings and toestablish appropriate global responses to these findings.''   He and Ms. Montgomery said their companies have begun efforts todevelop safe substitutes for CFCs, but neither could say when theymight be available.   DuPont announced last week it was phasing out production of CFCs.</TEXT></DOC>
