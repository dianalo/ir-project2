(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>GSA's Appeal for Fewer Protests Shows No ResultandM;Almost a year after General Services Administration officials urged agenciesto remedy vendor complaints before a bid protest is filed, the number ofprotests filed has not changed significantly.andM;Several procurement lawyers said the problem may be that GSA has not focusedenough on successful methods of resolving protests at the agency level.andM;GSA's quarterly protest report, issued last month, showed the number ofprotests granted by the GSA Board of Contract Appeals rose slightly, from 30in fiscal 1988 to 34 in fiscal 1989.andM;Bernard Abeshouse, chief of the Acquisition Evaluation and Analysis Branch ofGSA's Information Resources Management Service, said IRMS officials had hopedagencies would resolve vendor complaints and end the need for board protests.andO;If agency protests are handled properly, he said, GSBCA rarely should grant aprotest if the agency has denied it.andM;&quot;GSA's philosophy is that the lower the level at which a problem can beresolved, the better off everyone will be,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The procurement willmove along faster and the government and the protester will be moresatisfied.&quot;andM;The branch reviewed all board decisions from June 1985 through the end offiscal 1989.andP;  The survey showed no major differences in the outcome of casesthat the agency had tried to resolve before a vendor filed a protest andthose where vendors filed protests directly with the GSBCA.andM;The report said that of the 867 protests filed since 1985, 37.3 percent weresettled and 13.3 percent were granted, 14 percent were denied and 23.1percent were withdrawn.andP;  About 12.5 percent were dismissed.andM;Of the 867, 115 protests followed a protest at the contracting agency.andP;  Ofthose 115 cases, 37.4 percent were settled and 15.7 percent were granted.andP;  Inaddition, 15.7 percent were denied, 16.5 percent were dismissed and 14.8percent were withdrawn.andM;Last March IRMS officials urged agencies to improve internal protestprocedures to reduce the number of GSBCA protests.andP;  Abeshouse said his branchdrafted a set of protest guidelines but GSA officials have not issued thedraft.andM;Several procurement attorneys said the survey results are hard to interpretbecause the report does not explain why the protests could not be resolved atthe agency level.andM;Patricia A. Szervo, former IRMS commissioner and an attorney with theWashington law firm of Pettit andamp; Martin, said the agency protest should helpeliminate costly litigation at the board and suggested it would be moreeffective to examine what prevented solutions.andM;&quot;It seems to me they're looking at the wrong statistics,&quot; said CyrusPhillips, a former GSBCA judge and attorney with the Washington law firm ofMcGuire, Woods, Battle andamp; Boothe.andP;  &quot;The telling statistic would be how manyprotests were filed at the agency level and resolved.&quot;andM;Joseph Petrillo, a partner in the Washington firm of Petrillo andamp; Hordell, saidthe absence of full discovery procedures at the agency level contributes toboard protests.andP;  Without a guaranteed method for obtaining all the facts froman agency, protesters are likely to continue to litigate when they lose, hesaid.andM;&quot;The temptation for an agency to say no [to a protest] when they're holdingall the cards is great,&quot; Petrillo said.andP;  &quot;But discovery takes time and thegovernment would have to add on the time for an agency process to the time ofthe protest procedures at GSBCA and the General Accounting Office.&quot;andM;Since mid-1985, the report said, 56.6 percent of the protests were filedduring the post-award stage.andP;  Slightly more than a quarter of the protests,25.4 percent, were filed during the solicitation phase.andP;  Another 16.6 percentwere filed during the pre-award stage, and 1.4 percent were filed eitherprematurely or against acquisitions that were not taking place.andM;The report said the board processed cases in an average of 21 workdays andprotesters recovered their costs in 21.1 percent of the cases.andM;In 1989, vendors filed 268 protests.andP;  The highest number -- 37 each -- werefiled against the Army and Navy.andP;  The Air Force came second with 28, followedby the Interior and Justice departments with 18 each.andP;  Vendors filed 13protests against the Defense Department.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
