Certainly it has reached a danger point, asevidenced by the fighting that raged across Sloveniayesterday, leaving a reported 100 people dead or injured. TheWest might be wise to consider seriously the reality that twonationalities have overwhelmingly voiced their desire tobreak free from Belgrade and integrate into Western Europe.   The republics of Slovenia and Croatia declaredindependence from communist-dominated Serbia despite explicitwarnings that the U.S., France and Britain, among others,would not recognize their secessions. (Austria and Germanyare less adamant.) The West had supported Yugoslavia'sfederal Prime Minister Ante Markovic, who has seemed to offerthe best hope of keeping the republics stitched together.</LP><TEXT>   For a time it seemed that a real breakup could be avoided.But centuries of historic division along cultural, politicaland religious lines made Mr. Markovic's eventual failurepredictable. As the two maps here show, the conflictingregions are divided much as they were from 1719 until 1878,when Croatia and Slovenia were aligned with the West underthe Hapsburgs, while the Ottomans imposed their brand ofgovernance on the Serbs (see accompanying illustration -- WSJJune 28, 1991.)   Today Serbian communists, while professing to support astrong federal government, have worked to thwart Mr.Markovic's economic and political reforms. They exploitednationalism to divert attention from socialist failures. TheSerbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, employed Serbiandominance of the army officer corps to threaten otherrepublics.   Slovenia and Croatia, the two wealthiest republics withstrong historic ties to Central and Western Europe, meanwhiledrafted plans for reforms. The two stopped sending funds tothe federal government and held referendums in which largemajorities of the people voted for independence. WhenCroatia's 600,000-strong Serbian minority (out of a totalresidency of 4.5 million) cried foul, the path for collisionwas set.   Moreover the West's efforts to prop up theprogressive-minded Mr. Markovic appear only to haveencouraged hard-liner Milosevic. The Serbian president (whosepopularity with Serbs has slipped badly) seems to see Westernopposition to the breakup as a mandate for militaryintervention. Thus Yugoslav tanks have taken up key positionsin the breakaway states, generating a tense war of nerves.   For the U.S. and Europe, this situation calls for a fresh,more realistic look at policy. It should be asked whetherthere is more likelihood of the Slovenes and Croatssuccessfully developing as democratic states outsideYugoslavia than coexisting peacefully within it. By insistingon preserving a federated Yugoslavia the West could encouragefurther intimidation by Serbian President Milosevic and loseall chance for a peaceful transition.   The breakaway republics are not demanding that an irondivide be erected between themselves and the rest ofYugoslavia. They only are rejecting the right of the federalgovernment and Serbia to dominate their policies. The merefact of their small size need hardly be an issue. If it were,Switzerland would not be Europe's richest country.   The U.S. and Europe, by aligning themselves with what isin effect the Milosevic camp, fuel the tensions. If anaccommodation can be found to patch Yugoslavia together, somuch the better. But it will have to be a very differentYugoslavia from this one, where the uncompromising positionof a single man, Slobodan Milosevic, has brought about adangerous crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
