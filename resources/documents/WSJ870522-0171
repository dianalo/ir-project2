The companies are among the growing number that have conducted &quot;odd-lot programs&quot; aimed at buying out individual investors who own fewer than 100 shares. The idea is to eliminate the expense -- estimated at about $12 to $18 a shareholder for most companies -- of providing such things as quarterly reports and dividend checks to a horde of small stockholders.    Buyout programs may make some investors feel unwelcome. But they also &quot;may be a blessing to a lot of . . . people whose only reason for having the stock is that they don't know how to dispose of it,&quot; says James Cloonan, president of the American Association of Individual Investors, based in Chicago.    Odd-lot activity constitutes a small fraction of trading nowadays. On the New York Stock Exchange last year, odd-lot sales amounted to 220.6 million shares, considerably less than 1% of total trading volume. Odd-lot purchases were even smaller, at 108.5 million shares.    But odd lots are still created in many transactions. Corporate spinoffs and acquisitions, which often leave investors with small odd-lot holdings, are plentiful. Dividend-reinvestment plans, monthly investment plans and employee benefit programs also continue to trickle small numbers of shares to recipients.    Although odd-lotters together own only 2% of the average company's shares, 52% of all shareholders are odd-lotters, says Robin Disston, president of Greenwich, Conn.-based Disston Associates, which specializes in odd-lot buyouts.    Even some companies that haven't considered an odd-lot buyout say it sounds appealing. &quot;We're a prime candidate for this,&quot; says Neale S. Godfrey, president of the First Women's Bank in New York, which has an unusually large number of small shareholders. &quot;When the bank was first capitalized, people were literally selling shares on the streets.&quot; Servicing the bank's 6,000 or so small stockholders, she says, is &quot;frightfully expensive.&quot;    An odd-lot buyout can be conducted in two basic ways. In one, a company makes a tender offer, limited to small holders, for its own stock. That's how such buyouts were generally done until 1983 when the Securities and Exchange Commission expanded the alternatives.    The method used more often today is for the company to hire a third party to package the odd lots in larger batches to sell on the open market. The third party can be a proxy solicitation firm, a bank, a brokerage house, or a firm specializing in buyouts, such as Disston Associates or New York-based Shareholder Communications Corp. Alexander B. Miller, president of Shareholder Communications, predicts that by 1990 the number of odd-lot buyouts will multiply to more than 150 a year.    When companies trim back shareholder rolls on their own, they typically make a tender offer through a mass mailing and get a 15% to 20% favorable response. Hiring a specialized firm capable of making thousands of phone calls to holders can increase the success rate to 35% or more.    Some companies just aren't interested in odd-lot buyouts, no matter how the programs are structured. Banks, for example, often prefer to have odd-lotters on the books because small investors are potential depositors and loan customers.    Odd-lot buyouts can save an investor money. The buyouts generally aren't made at a premium, but holders' selling costs are zero or at least significantly less than selling the shares conventionally.&quot;If you were thinking of selling the shares anyhow, obviously this kind of an offer is going to save you some dollars,&quot; says Maynard Engel, director of the personal financial planning division at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.    Mr. Cloonan says individuals should hang on to odd-lot holdings if that is the only way they can have a diversified portfolio. He also notes that being a shareholder, however small, is an effective way to keep up-to-date on developments affecting a particular company.    Still, he advises odd-lot holders to think twice before turning down a buyout. Most brokers, he notes, will charge a minimum commission of $25 to $35, even if the investor is selling a single share. </TEXT></DOC>
