(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   National leaders of the Assemblies ofGod have taken no action on Jimmy Swaggart following theevangelist's most emotional church speech since he stepped downfrom the pulpit, a denomination spokeswoman said Monday.   Swaggart received a favorable response Sunday night from thecrowd at his Family Worship Center, but officials of the Assembliesof God said his appearances during Easter services would haveviolated the terms of a one-year ban on preaching it ordered lastweek.   Taking the microphone briefly during Sunday night's service,Swaggart paced and shouted into the microphone.   ``It works! It works!,'' he said, shaking a Bible as he doeswhen he preaches. ``If there is a reporter here, spread the wordeverywhere. It works!''   The Rev. Everett Stenhouse, assistant general superintendent forthe Assemblies of God, said Swaggart's appearance would haveviolated the one-year ban.   But because Swaggart has not signed any agreement, he has notsubmitted to the church's rehabilitation program, Stenhouse said ina telephone interview from Springfield, Mo., the church's nationalheadquarters.   The church's General Presbytery last Tuesday banned Swaggartfrom the pulpit for at least a year for ``moral failure.'' Aself-described prostitute has said Swaggart paid her to pose nudefor him.   Swaggart must decide this week whether to accept thedisciplinary action, a choice that could affect the future of hisfinancially troubled ministry. He said through his attorney lastweek that he will defy the order and return to the pulpit May 22.   Juleen Turnage, a national church spokeswoman, criticizedSwaggart's appearances Sunday and said he probably would faceexpulsion if he did not quickly accept the church's discipline.   ``I know our executives want to give him sufficient time torespond to their written notification, and I would think that maybeby the end of this week, if they have not heard from him, theexecutives will be looking at what further steps they can take tobring this to a close,'' she said.   The 13 members of the denomination's executive presbytery held atelephone conference on Monday, but took no action, Turnage said.   ``We still have not heard from Jimmy Swaggart. We're stillwaiting to hear,'' Turnage said.   Swaggart spokeswoman LeAnne Weill said Monday that Swaggart hadnot sent the denomination a response and had not set a date fordoing so.   After an earlier service Sunday morning, Swaggart launched intoa talk on the love of Christ when a reporter asked if he wasleaving the Assemblies of God.   A heckler had disrupted the morning service to accuse theevangelist of hypocrisy.   ``Brother Swaggart, your hypocrisy is scornful of the governmentof God,'' the young man, about 16 years old, yelled during a brieflull in the service.   Swaggart, who has not been preaching since tearfully confessingto an unspecified sin on Feb. 21, was sitting on the church's stageat the time of the outburst with his wife, Frances, and otherchurch leaders. Swaggart did not visibly react to the heckler.   The Rev. Jim Rentz, who has taken over as pastor, watched theyouth for only a moment and then told worshipers, ``Let's standfolks and let's just praise the Lord.''   Rentz and the congregation drowned out the youth until he wasescorted away by ushers. During his brief outburst, the youth alsoreferred to ``immoral sins'' and ``money.''   The incident came after Swaggart spoke briefly as he introduceda musical duet.</TEXT></DOC>
