The experimentaltests were formed with a lead bar test pattern and a biologic patternfor grid mammography and for magnification mammography with differentmagnifications. In 50 patients the authors compared the diagnostic efficiencyof 2X magnification mammography with high-speed screen-film system andgrid mammography with photosensitized industrial film. Both mammographicsystems require the same skin entrance radiation dose. They analyze detectabilityof microcalcifications and the assessment of margins. For the same organradiation dose, grid mammography and magnification mammography yieldedcomparable detectability. The essential advantages of magnification mammographyare faster processing, easier visual evaluation, and the ability of furtherinformation due to different projections.</TEXT></DOC>
