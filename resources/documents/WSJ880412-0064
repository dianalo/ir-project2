The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and the Automobile Importers of America want the FTC to beef up a rule that currently governs voluntary arbitration under the Magnuson-Moss Act of 1975. A spokesman for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association said the rule has fallen into conflict with so-called lemon laws passed by many states that often define when and how a dissatisfied car buyer can take a manufacturer to arbitration over a conflict.    He said the states' procedures vary widely and in one instance, a manufacturer submitted the same plan for an arbitration program to six states and three approved it while three turned it down. The trade association wants the FTC to take clearer oversight of procedural aspects of voluntary arbitration programs, deciding which qualify and which don't, among other things.    The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association filed the petition on behalf of Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp., Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. and Volvo of North America Corp. The AIA said it filed on behalf of 20 member companies.    The two trade associations are billing their recommendations as &quot;aiding consumers.&quot; But at least one state attorney general sees the effort as a &quot;sneak attack&quot; on state lemon laws.    &quot;Today's petition to the Federal Trade Commission is a backdoor attempt to strip car buyers of the legal rights that states have given consumers,&quot; Hubert Humphrey III, Minnesota's attorney general, said. &quot;I'm already talking with the other attorneys general. We're not going to let this happen.&quot;    The Big Three auto makers are all part of the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association but in this case General Motors Corp. has broken ranks with its fellow members. While noting that it doesn't oppose the petition, a statement released by GM said: &quot;The petition seeks to pre-empt state regulation of private arbitration programs sponsored by the auto companies. . . . We couldn't join the other petitioners without breaking faith with states to whom we have made commitments in recent years.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
