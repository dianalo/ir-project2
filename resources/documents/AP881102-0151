(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hickory, dickory, dock. The mice areeating the pot.   The Shelby County Sheriff's Department says a gang of rodents hasinfiltrated the agency's storage room and pilfered bags of marijuanakept as evidence for upcoming trials.   Authorities believe the perpetrators are mice seeking refuge fromthe cold. It's not the first time this has happened, said SheriffRick D. Isgrigg. ``But this year is the worst,'' he said.   The rodents have chewed through several 29-ounce and 1-pound bagsof marijuana.   ``They're playing havoc with the stuff,'' Isgrigg said Tuesday.``From all indications, they must be rolling in it.''   The mice have discriminating tastes, however. They've passed up abag of potato chips held as evidence in a grocery burglary, in thisarea southeast of Indianapolis.   Because the pests refuse to rat on each other, Isgrigg has placedmounds of rodent-killer in the 20-by-25-foot property room.   ``We have to nip this in the bud _ or nip it in the bag,'' thesheriff said.</TEXT><DATELINE>WADSWORTH, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Now that he's captured, if the legendary``16-foot Wadsworth gator'' could talk he might tell these residentseast of Reno a couple of things.   First, he's a South American caiman who's only 3 feet long and 10pounds.   Second, he likes cheeseburgers much better than the chicken baitthat's been set out for him as lures in the Truckee River where'she's been vacationing for the past few weeks.   Nevada Game Warden Steve Albert took custody Tuesday of thecaiman, a reptile cousin of the alligator. Albert said he would tryto find a new home for the caiman in a zoo or aquarium.   The reptile was first spotted in the river Oct. 14 and wasprobably dumped there by someone who tired of it as a pet, Albertsaid.   Since the first sighting, Wadsworth residents had believed thatthe reptile was an alligator. The town's storytellers eventuallytalked the legendary beast up to a 16-footer.   The state Department of Wildlife became involved and set chickenmeat bait traps along the river, but to no avail.   But last week, Robert Lester, 22, of Sparks and John Warner, 26,of Reno captured the caiman while fishing for trout.   Warner said he kept the caiman in his bathtub and fed itcheeseburgers hoping to make him a pet, even though that's illegalin Nevada.   But Warner finally decided to give up the caiman and collect a$500 reward a Reno businessman had put up for the ``Wadsworthgator.''   Eddie Floyd, a University of Florida alumnus, said he offered themoney because the alligator is the mascot of the university's sportsteam.   Floyd paid the reward Tuesday then immediately gave up custody ofthe caiman to wildlife officials.   ``I can't take it back to Florida because there are no FloridaFightin' Caimans,'' Floyd lamented. ``But I'm glad it's OK just thesame.''</TEXT><DATELINE>DALTON, Ga.

Anderson, the 40-year-old co-owner of a carpet outlet, got hookedon playing midway games when he and his family visited Opryland inNashville, Tenn.
