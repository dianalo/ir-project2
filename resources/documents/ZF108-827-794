Skinner a report calling for greater automation in theOffice of the Secretary of Transportaion (OST) and in the department's othermanagement offices.andM;The report, the first in a series of follow-on reports to the NationalTransportation Policy (NTP), will focus on specific strategies for achievinglong-range goals.andM;Robert Knisely, Transportation's deputy assistant secretary for budget andco-author of the report, said the recommendations include increased use ofcomputers by senior managers and their staff for administration, accountingand word processing, electronic mail and other local area network functions.andM;Knisely said he advised putting more resources into ADP in OST.andP;  He also saidhe will urge the department to develop applications software or groupware assolutions to management inefficiencies.andM;&quot;We'll be pushing from the budget side to increase ADP resources in fiscal1991,&quot; Knisely said.andM;Transportation already has taken a few basic steps to increase managementefficiency, he said.andP;  Earlier this year Knisely's office put the department'sbudget on a LAN.andM;The LAN uses a Novell Inc. system as the network server to about 30 users.andO;PCs attached to the LAN include Compaq Computer Corp. Deskpro and 386 PCs, aswell as AST Research Inc. 286 and 386 PCs, used mostly for accounting,spreadsheet and word processing.andM;&quot;This year--it sounds awfully primitive, but it's a great leap forward forthe environment here -- in the departmental budget shop we now have a set ofthe official numbers, the tables about last year's money and next year'smoney, all by account, all locked up and published on the LAN,&quot; Knisely said.andM;Signature SheetsandM;The budget department recently automated signature sheets attached todocuments slated for review by various management levels.andM;&quot;There is something which I think is fairly common in federal budgeting,which we call white sheets,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;In general, on one sheet of paper, you start with a set of numbers somewhereacross the top, then you've got some narrative about some particular lineitem in the budget or account in the budget, and then you've got perhaps thedate of when it was last reviewed.andM;&quot;Then you've got a set of boxes across the bottom that says it's beenreviewed by the analysts, a branch chief, the budget director or theassistant secretary, so you can keep track of who reviews what,&quot; Kniselysaid.andM;&quot;We have a primitive form of that under way now, where you can pull in thenumbers from Lotus into WorkPerfect 5.1 and start creating those white sheetsautomatically.andP;  Again that's a real primitive groupware application exceptthe thing has been fought over and been made to work.&quot;andM;The NTP, which Skinner issued in February, is intended to provide a frameworkof the U.S.andP;  transportation plans and policy, as well as strategies forachieving the goals.andM;The follow-on reports, known as the National Transportation Policy, Phase-II(NTP-II), follow with detailed specifics on how officials plan to reach thegoals outlined in NTP-I.andM;&quot;The NTP-II is basically an efort to look and see how the department can bemade more capable of responding to the challenges of NTP-I,&quot; Knisely said.andM;Transportation officials are considering structural changes at OST, but mostof the recommendations will be for changes such as increased use ofcomputers, Knisely said.andM;Last year, Skinner appointed Kate L. Moore as assistant secretary for budgetand programs.andM;Knisely said department officials expect Moore will support efforts withinOST for increased use of ADP.andM;Smarter, Not HarderandM;Skinner named Thomas D. Larson, administrator of the Federal HighwayAdministration, to head the NTP-II effort.andP;  Eugene McCormick, FHWA's deputyadministrator, said, &quot;Through enhancements of individual technologies, we canwork smarter, not harder.andP;  Phase II shows what technology has to do withimproving the efficiency of transportation in this country.andM;&quot;Transportation managers and providers are far flung, therefore communicationand coordination within OST and the operating administration becomescritical,&quot; he said.andM;On June 13, about 500 managers from across Transportation gathered inWashington to discuss the NTP-II.andP;  Their comments will be reflectedthroughout the series of NTP-II is not merely a showcase to tout newtechnology, he said, but rather an effort to create a sense of purpose andrenewed enthusiasm at all levels.andM;'Not All Buck Rogers'andM;&quot;The second phase of the National Transportation Policy is not all BuckRogers.andP;  The theme of NTP-II is working together and communicating, and inthe end bringing to bear our best in tackling the challenges facingTransportation in the next century,&quot; McCormick said.andM;Still, information resources will be a key to increased success ofTransportation's goals and programs, Knisely agreed.andM;&quot;Norbert Weiner said that 'cybernetics is the science of communication andcontrol of the animal and the machine.'andM;&quot;Many people would add organization to that,&quot; Knisely said.andP;  &quot;So you have anorganism, a machine and organization.&quot;andP;  By speeding up the command andcontrol process through automation, you are developing the potential for amore responsive organization, he said.andM;If you speed up automation when no one else does, &quot;then you can be acarnivore while everybody else is being a herbivore, and you can eat theirlunch,&quot; Knisely said.andM;&quot;We've now got as far as PCs on a lot of desks, but not enough,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;The next, stage is to try to get them hooked up, and then the next stageafter that is to produce processes to take advantage of that added speed andmemory so that they're a little more complex than e-mail.andP;  We don't even havee-mail all the way around yet.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
