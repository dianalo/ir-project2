Mr. Mullins was anindependent agent who used the agency's equipment andservices, his attorney said.   At trial last October, the three men were convicted ofmultiple counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud and useof fictitious names. The defendants allegedly created a listof more than 50 fictitious passengers between 1986 and 1988,then tampered with American's computer-system records bycrediting the fake travelers with miles that had been flownby real people who weren't members of the airline'sAAdvantage program.   Attorneys for the defendants said the court allowed thethree to remain free pending appeal to the Ninth CircuitCourt. Attorneys for Mr. Winkleman and Mr. Rinker said theyplan to appeal the conviction partly on the basis thatevidence was excluded at trial showing that no crime wascommitted. An attorney for Mr. Mullins said he didn't doanything illegal.
