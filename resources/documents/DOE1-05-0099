The single-particle energyhas been self-consistently evaluated using a separable representationof the Paris N-N potential. The results at a given temperature are comparedwith those obtained at the same temperature with the G-matrix frozenat T=0. Fitting these results with a Skyrme-like interaction the correspondingparameters have been estimated at different temperatures.</TEXT></DOC>
