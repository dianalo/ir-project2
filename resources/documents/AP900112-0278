The chain reaction also demonstrated that tremors in Tokyo'sfinancial markets can have big repercussions overseas _ especiallyin the United States _ because Japan is the world's largestcreditor.   ``Maybe this is the first example that our dependence of capitalis making us catch cold when someone sneezes,'' said Robert Brusca,chief financial economist at Nikko Securities Co. InternationalInc. in New York.   A big drop in Japanese government bond prices and weakness inthe yen sent share prices tumbling in Tokyo early Friday. TheNikkei average of 225 stocks plummeted 653.36 points, the biggestone-day point decline since a loss of 731.91 points on Nov. 10,1987.   In the first seven sessions of the new year, the index has lostalmost 1,400 points, or 3.7 percent.   Later, stocks fell sharply in London with the FT-SE 100 shareindex falling 37.8 points to 2,380.1, the biggest drop in sevenweeks.   The selloff continued in New York, where the Dow Jonesindustrial average plunged 71.46 points, or 2.59 percent, to2,689.21. It was the biggest point drop since last October'smini-crash, which knocked 190.58 points off the average, and the13th biggest ever.   The weakness of the yen and expectations that Japan's interestrates will have to go still higher to make the currency moreattractive have hurt bonds and stocks, Tokyo analysts said. Bank ofJapan Governor Yasushi Mieno helped accelerate the fall Friday bysaying the yen's weakness could boost inflation by raising theprices of imported fuel and raw materials.   ``The market started falling as players realized that a higheryen and lower interest rates, the keys to last year's boomingmarket, won't come true,'' said Hironobu Hagio, a securitiesanalyst with Nippon Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo.   There was more bad inflation news in the United States Fridaywith the report that the producer price index rose 0.7 percent inDecember. That brought inflation at the wholesale level to 4.8percent in 1989, the highest since 1980.   David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura SecuritiesInternational Inc. in New York, said any rise in inflation shouldbe short-lived, stemming mainly from cold-induced runups in theprice of oil and produce.   A more serious problem for the U.S. stock and bond markets isthat they are less attractive today to international investors,Resler said.   Interest rates have risen recently in Europe as well as Japanbecause of a perception that inflation is increasing. Higher ratesabroad could force a similar move in the United States because ofthe need to attract foreign capital to finance the country's largedeficits.   Nikko's Brusca said yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds noware only about 1.85 percentage points higher than yields on 10-yearJapanese government bonds. That's one of the smallest differentialsof the past decade and down from a margin of more than 4 percentagepoints early in 1989, he said.   ``The fear is that the U.S. is not an attractive place forforeigners to invest now,'' Brusca said.   Domestic investors haven't shown a willingness to take up theslack, Resler said. ``The key is that there seems to be relativelylittle activity coming from the institutional investors in the U.S.at a time when institutional investors overseas are inclined toliquidate to their dollar holdings,'' he said.   There were a few bright spots Friday.   West Germany withstood the selloff with stocks finishing mixedin Frankfurt. Hopes that the democratization of Eastern Europe willpay off with a big growth dividend for West Germany have supportedthe Frankfurt market and the German mark.   In New York, the American Stock Exchange won regulatory approvalto begin trading a type of put option on Japan's Nikkei stockaverage. The puts allow investors to profit from a decline in theindex, and Friday's plunge in Tokyo sparked heavy interest.   The options rose to $5 apiece from $4.125 at the opening. Volumetotaled more than 3.1 million options, ``far above expectations,''said Benjamin D. Krause, senior vice president of the securitiesdivision at the Amex.</TEXT></DOC>
