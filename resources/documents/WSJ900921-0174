Theoutcome is far from certain.   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has given the issue an Adrenalinpush as voters are forced to face Switzerland's vulnerabilityas a small country heavily dependent on outside sources ofenergy. About 65% of Switzerland's total energy needs comefrom foreign oil sources. This dependence is balanced againsthealth and safety concerns over nuclear power plants.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The sensitivity of our situation is illustrated byKuwait,&quot; says Edwin Somm, Swiss executive vice president ofAsea Brown Boveri AG in Zurich.   Like other industrialized countries, a certain complacencyhad set in after 1986, when cheap oil started to flow. Butnow there are concerns over energy's significance forSwitzerland's future economic growth, jobs and nationalsecurity.   &quot;Energy is the most important theme of our times,&quot;declares Vreni Spoerry, a Zurich representative in thenational parliament.   Three proposals will confront the Swiss electorate nextweekend. Two are a direct result of the 1986 Chernobyldisaster, which shocked anti-nuclear groups into gatheringenough signatures to force national votes on their concerns.   One proposal would stop construction of future nuclearplants and demand that present facilities close as soon asfeasible. The second would place a 10-year moratorium onbuilding any new plants.   Switzerland currently has five nuclear plants producingaround 40% of the country's electricity.   The Swiss government has strongly advised citizens to voteagainst both initiatives. &quot;It would be irresponsible to giveup nuclear energy as an option,&quot; says the government in abrochure sent to every household to explain the issues.   In the brochure, which includes all viewpoints, supportersof the initiatives declare: &quot;In a thickly populated countrylike Switzerland, nuclear power plants are an unacceptablerisk.&quot;   The third proposal is on a parliamentary decision to givemore powers to the federal government to determine energypolicy. The government would be empowered to lay downguidelines for energy consumption, including the right to setstandards for energy use in factories, automobiles andappliances.   In 1983, such central control was refused in a referendumas a majority of cantons refused to go along. This timearound there is said to be considerably more support.However, prominent voices are still opposed. &quot;We won't saveenergy, but face a flood of state regulations,&quot; protestsHeinz Allenspach, Swiss Employers' Association director. &quot;Allwe will get is more bureaucracy.&quot;   Hanging in streets throughout Switzerland this week areposters with warning messages. Pedestrians are bombarded onthe one hand with warnings that if they vote against nuclearenergy, calamity will result through a breakdown of transportand health facilities. On the other hand, they are askedominously from a poster depicting the Swiss flag: &quot;Where doyou go after the nuclear catastrophe?&quot; Coming as somewhat ofan emotional relief are dry appeals against the encroachmentof the state.   Switzerland isn't the only country faced with the nucleardecision. The U.S., where nuclear power plants produce 19% ofthe country's electricity, has pondered the issue since theThree Mile Island accident in 1979. Sweden voted in 1980 togradually stop nuclear power use; but faced with finding analternative, it is now engaged in a debate over whether doingso is possible. Italians voted after Chernobyl to dropnuclear power development, and the government is betting onan expansion of coal and gas production.   However, Switzerland will be the first country to vote onthe issue since the threat to Western oil supplies from theIraqi crisis.   In July, a survey by Zurich market researchers IsopublicAG indicated that the Swiss would vote against nuclearenergy. Those surveyed were given a choice of threealternatives: a stop, a moratorium, or continuedconstruction. About 46% wanted a stop; 25% a moratorium, and19% favored continuation of nuclear power plant construction.About 10% were undecided.   No survey has been made since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.&quot;I wish that I'd been given the chance,&quot; says Isopublicspokesman Robert Kappeler. &quot;Through this crisis, publicopinion could have altered substantially.&quot;   Also, he points out, the referendum campaign is now infull swing, and &quot;that can change a lot in the way peoplethink.&quot;   For 30 years Alexander Euler, an engineer and member ofparliament, has fought against nuclear power. He argues:&quot;Atom reactors produce dangers which cannot be controlled.Nuclear energy technology presumes that people don't makemistakes. But making mistakes is part of being a person.&quot;   He pleads that it is possible to do without nuclear powerif electricity is used more efficiently, if more efficienttechnologies are employed and if alternative sources ofenergy are encouraged.   &quot;Every kilowatt-hour of nuclear energy endangers plant,animal and human life,&quot; Mr. Euler maintains. &quot;Every nuclearpower plant increases the possibility of a catastrophe.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
