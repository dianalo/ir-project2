But there's something a bit odd about the increases: They're happening despite the industry's slowest traffic growth in seven years.    Normally, airlines get nervous when traffic slows, so they cut fares. But the industry's domestic traffic rose only 1.7% in the first half of this year over the same period last year -- and fares didn't drop.    In fact, average domestic fares are up 10.7% from a year ago, after falling for three straight years, according to the Air Transport Association.    &quot;It's not a good sign for consumers,&quot; says Lee Howard, executive vice president of Airline Economics Inc., an airline consulting company in Washington, D.C.    Airline mergers are obviously a big factor. But most carriers also seem to be changing their pricing strategy. Previously, many airlines thought they needed to keep traffic high to make money, so they kept prices down. &quot;But profit margins seem to be better with lower traffic and higher fares,&quot; says Robert Coggin, an assistant vice president for Delta Air Lines.    All of which isn't exactly encouraging for people planning trips this fall. Traffic -- and thus air fares -- normally drop in the fall. But many analysts are predicting that air travelers won't get any break in fall fares this year.    &quot;Unless traffic dramatically drops, fares should stay right where they are now -- high,&quot; says Mr. Howard.    Some Cabs Take Plastic,   But Does Anyone Care?    BUSINESS PEOPLE charge just about everything when they travel. So why not cab fares?    Most taxi companies in Los Angeles, Seattle, Indianapolis and a few other cities let customers pay with credit cards; drivers carry portable charge machines. But the idea isn't catching on.    &quot;Probably less than 5% of our customers use it,&quot; says Joseph Chernow, president of Yellow Cab Service Corp., which lets customers use credit cards in Colorado Springs, Colo.    One problem could be lack of knowledge; many taxis that have the feature don't post signs mentioning it. Also, most people don't use credit cards for inexpensive items, and many cab rides are less than $10.    And some taxi companies have had a problem they don't like to discuss: Cab drivers tend not to check the validity of credit cards, so some cab companies are getting hit with charges from stolen or phony cards.    &quot;There's definitely a lot of fraud,&quot; says Anthony Palmeri, vice president of Yellow Cab of San Diego. &quot;People figure that because the charges are so cheap that they can get away with it.&quot; As a result, he says, his company now requires drivers to radio in all charges to headquarters, where card numbers are checked.    Airline Baggage Report   Doesn't Flatter TWA   THE FEDERAL government in the past didn't make air lines report baggage problems the same way, so nobody really knew which carrier had the worst record.    But the reporting requirements were standardized this year -- much to the embarrassment of Trans World Airlines.    In four of the first five months of 1988, TWA posted the industry's worst &quot;mishandled&quot; baggage rate, which is the number of bags lost, damaged or delayed per passenger. Its rate over that time period was about three times as bad as that of Pan American World Airways, which had the best fivemonth record.    &quot;How do I defend those numbers? That's pretty tough,&quot; a TWA spokesman says.    Still, he offers one excuse: TWA has mainly one domestic hub, St. Louis, while most competitors have at least two. So the airline has less room for error; if its baggage system breaks down in St. Louis, a larger portion of its bags will be delayed.    But the spokesman notes that TWA recently hired 70 extra baggage handlers. TWA also plans to spend an additional $1.5 million on its St. Louis baggage system this year. &quot;We're not just sitting on the problem,&quot; the spokesman says. &quot;We're trying to do something.&quot;    ---                      Bungled Baggage   Mishandled baggage reports per 1,000 passengers, January through May, 1988 Trans World .................................... 11.89 Piedmont ....................................... . 9.88 United ....................................... ... 9.26 Delta ....................................... .... 8.32 Continental ..................................... 7.99 American ....................................... . 7.88 USAir ....................................... .... 7.17 Eastern ....................................... .. 6.96 Northwest ....................................... 6.92 Pan American .................................... 3.74   Source: Department of Transportation   ---   Odds and Ends   ROOM SERVICE is fast becoming another perk that travelers pass up. Three out of every four people responding to a poll by the Gallup Organization and Lodging Hospitality magazine said they don't usually order room service. Hotel officials blame increased efforts by companies to cut travel costs. . . . British Airways crews have an extra weapon against unruly passengers: plastic handcuffs. The cuffs are standard equipment on board the airline's flights, but a spokesman insists they're used only in extreme cases. &quot;It's to deal with someone who has indulged too much in alcohol and just can't be contained,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
