Fewer than 20% of the large defense firms convicted ofcorrupt activities in the past year have been cut off fromany of their lucrative military business. Boeing Co., GrummanCorp., Raytheon Co. and General Motors Corp.'s HughesAircraft unit, among others, pleaded guilty to illegalinformation-swapping on the condition that prosecutorsrecommend they remain eligible for contracts.</LP><TEXT>   Investigators say the law doesn't permit suspension frombidding unless a firm refuses to cooperate with prosecutorsand balks at imposing tighter management controls. Thus,deciding to plead guilty &quot;is strictly a money issue for thecorporations,&quot; says Washington defense attorney JosephCovington. He says fighting the charges may make the Pentagonget tougher.   Worried that industry has been let off too easy, the HouseEnergy and Judiciary committees demand more data on recentcriminal settlements.                                                                                                          SMALL SUBCONTRACTORS say they'll feel defense cutbacksfirst and worst.   Small high-technology firms that subcontract with majordefense companies expect many of their contracts to bedropped or canceled as the defense budget is chopped over thenext few years. If a rumored freeze on defense spendingoccurs, &quot;small businesses will be hurt first,&quot; says DonaldGrigg of the Association of Small Research Engineering andTechnical Services Companies.   Prime contractors, facing cuts, typically try to keepbusiness in-house, thus keeping cash flowing through theircompanies. When major firms subcontract work, &quot;they'retalking millions or tens of millions of dollars,&quot; says WalterLandauer of Purvis Systems, Westbury, N.Y. Top militarycontractors are even cutting out midsized subcontractors, hesays.                                                                                                          WALL STREET retreats from the defense industry.   Major securities firms are abandoning defense companyresearch, figuring no one wants to buy stocks in a decliningindustry. Dean Witter reassigns its defense analyst totelecommunications. Merrill Lynch isn't replacing a defenseanalyst, who left last year. Those who haven't beenreassigned outright are picking up new responsibilities. &quot;Youcan only tell people to sell stocks for so long,&quot; says PhilipFriedman of PaineWebber, who picked up telecommunications.   Wall Street's own woes contribute to the trend, pressuringfirms to direct research at areas that will generatebusiness. &quot;Clients don't have any interest in this group,&quot;says William Deatherage, Dean Witter's former defenseanalyst. Moreover, Pentagon spending pressures andPerestroika make a turnaround unlikely for several years.   The Street continues to cover firms that cater mostly tothe booming commercial aerospace industry, even issuing buyrecommendations on some.                                                                                                          AN ETHICS PROGRAM at General Dynamics Corp., launched in1985 at Navy prodding, gets 5,000 &quot;communications&quot; a yearfrom employees, most seeking advice or information; about 10%lead to investigations. The program, run by 32 directors,seeks to educate, not &quot;catch people.&quot;                                                                                                          LONG-DISTANCE contacts between service personnel and theirchildren get a boost. Positive Parenting Inc., Phoenix,markets a kit containing writing tips, colorful paper, and aspecial calendar. &quot;When men write to a child, they oftendon't know what to write about,&quot; says creator Melanie Rahn.                                                                                                          SAVING 40,000 JOBS is the goal of the firstmilitary-to-civilian conversion law, in Washington state,where over 200,000 jobs are defense-linked. The legislatureallocated $200,000 for an office to help defense-reliantfirms diversify and to retrain workers.                                                                                                          TIGHT MILITARY BUDGETS make for strange bedfellows.   Worried about having to shoulder the cost of hugeweapons-development projects alone, defense contractorsconsider more joint ventures. &quot;We've done a lot of teaming,and we've put arrangements in place to do more,&quot; says JamesCunnane, General Dynamics Corp.'s chief financial officer.The St. Louis company and neighbor McDonnell Douglas Corp.team on the Navy's Advanced Tactical Aircraft, designed toreplace the aging A-6.   Bidding for the Air Force's next-generation AdvancedTactical Fighter, Lockheed Corp., Boeing Co. and GeneralDynamics take on Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas.

Rivals General Motors Corp. and TexasInstruments Inc. join to build avionics subsystems.                                                                                                          BRIEFS: Army Times Publishing Co. says a greaterproportion of military personnel -- 34.5% -- invests in thestock market, compared with 25.7% for U.S. households. . . .With scant job placement services, the military academies areill-prepared to help the rising number of graduates expectedto quit the military in the wake of declining East-Westtensions.
