The company's president said the decline was caused chiefly by the dollar's weakness. Revenue slipped 1.2%, to $5.67 billion from $5.74 billion, largely because of a slowdown in deliveries of Airbus A-300 and A-310 commercial jets. Aerospatiale is a partner in Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium.    The French government sold about 19% of AGENCE HAVAS S.A. on the Paris stock exchange yesterday for the equivalent of $84.19 a share as part of its continuing denationalization program. On Friday, the government said that it sold 20% of the advertising and media concern's capital through a direct placement to a core group of holders at $90.92 a share. Investors had to pay an 8% premium to be part of the core group, which guaranteed ownership of a certain number of shares.    KAWASAKI KISEN KAISHA LTD., Japan's third-largest shipping line, plans to reduce the number of its seamen by 40% from the current 1,600 over the next two years, company officials said. Kawasaki also plans to reduce the number of ships it operates to 24 from 38 by March 1989. Like Japan's other shippers, Kawasaki has been suffering from the world-wide shipping slump.    LINDE AG, a West German machinery maker, raised its takeover offer for DUFFOUR andamp; IGON S.A., a French producer of industrial gases, to the equivalent of $704.70 a share, or a total of $93.8 million, from $629.19. That topped an offer by AGA AG, a Swedish industrial-gas company, of $671.14, or $89.3 million. The two have been trading offers since mid-April -- two other bidders have moved to the sidelines -- in an effort to gain access to the French industrial-gas market. Although it holds only 8% of that market, Duffour is the main French rival of Air Liquide S.A.    LUFTHANSA, the West German airline, said it bought a 10% stake in HAPAG LLOYD AG, Germany's largest oceangoing shipper, from Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG. Terms weren't disclosed, but the purchase is valued at the equivalent of about $17 million, based on Hapag Lloyd's current stock price. Lufthansa said the acquisition of the stake underscored its interest in becoming involved in means of transportation in addition to flight.    Mexico's government announced plans to sell its 58% stake in MEXICANA DE AVIACION, the airline it acquired at the outset of the nation's economic crisis. The long-awaited sale is considered among the most significant steps yet in a program to return important state companies to the private sector. The National Bank of Mexico, the agent for the sale, said investors have until June 30 to present their offers; the announcement said foreigners are eligible. A Mexicana spokesman said the airline incurred a loss of $14 million in 1986, bringing its accumulated deficit to $67 million.    SINGAPORE AIRLINES said group after-tax profit rose 58% in the year ended March 31, to the equivalent of $213.8 million from $135.3 million a year earlier, converting the Singapore dollar at its current rate. Operating profit jumped 151%, to $225.9 million from $90.2 million, and revenue increased 9.7%, to $1.65 billion from $1.50 billion. The airline ascribed the earnings gain to increased traffic and lower fuel prices. </TEXT></DOC>
