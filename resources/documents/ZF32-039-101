(logic products contract with ITTSemiconductors)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Wirbel, Loring.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Ramtron Corp and ITT Semiconductors have expanded theirthree-year-old agreement to cover logic products wherein Ramtron's256Kbyte ferroelectric RAM design (FRAM) will be merged with ITT's8-bit microcontroller.andP;  All fabrication for ITT will becentralized at Ramtron's Colorado Springs, CO fabrication center,which indicates a shift to low-density and integrated-logic memoryproducts in that facility.andP;  This is the result of high demand forRamtron's 4Kbyte and 16Kbyte memories to replace low-densityEEPROMs.andP;  The Ramtron-ITT agreement is Ramtron's first move intologic with its ferroelectric process.andP;  ITT indicated that logicapplications for ferroelectrics using ASIC design methodologieswas a possibility when the original agreement was signed in 1988.andO;The device covered under the expanded agreement will be sold underITT's name.andP;  Ramtron also hopes to develop an adaptivemicrocontroller that it would sell under its own name.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Ramtron Corp.
