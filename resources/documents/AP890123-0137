Communist Party leader Andre Lajoinie and a prominentconservative, Michel Noir, appealed Sunday for a parliamentaryinvestigation of suspicious trading in shares of the U.S. firmTriangle Industries Inc. last fall, just before it was acquired byPechiney SA, a government-owned aluminum manufacturer.   Officials at the presidential Elysee Palace say they will leavethe inquiry to the Commission des Operations de Bourse, watchdogagency of the French stock exchange.   ``Can the Elysee, which has preferred so far to defer to the(stock exchange) investigation and the slow process of the justicesystem, still shelter behind this line of defense?'' the financialdaily Les Echos asked in an editorial Monday.   Alain Boublil, top aide to Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy,resigned Friday, then filed libel suits against three publicationsfor reporting suspicions that he leaked vital information about theTriangle takeover.   A key figure is Roger-Patrice Pelat, a 70-year-old retiredbusinessman who met Mitterrand in a German prisoner-of-war camp.They worked together in the French Resistance and Pelat has been afrequent companion on the president's afternoon strolls throughParis.   Pelat was among investors who made quick profits by buyingTriangle stock at about $10 a share and selling a few days laterwhen Pechiney made its takeover bid Nov. 21 of $56 a share.   On Saturday, the daily Le Monde said Mitterrand was given asecret report saying Pelat or his son may have bought 40,000 sharesthrough a Swiss bank and a broker in Luxembourg in addition to the10,000 he was known to have purchased through a French bank.   Mitterrand's office issued a terse statement Monday night sayinghe had not received a report on the subject. It offered noexplanation or elaboration beyond repeating that the inquiry wasexclusively in the hands of the stock market commission and anyonefound guilty should be punished.   Palat said he would wait for the investigators' report beforecommenting. ``I'm a patient man and I don't want to interfere withthe Commission des Operations de Bourse,'' he told reporters Mondaynight outside his Paris apartment.   French newspaper reports say the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission told its French counterpart it was investigatingpurchases just before the takeover bid of about 220,000 shares inTriangle, which usually changed hands at the rate of only a fewthousand a day.   Much of the stock was bought through Swiss banks, which refuse toidentify their clients.   Max Theret, a businessman with close ties to Mitterrand'sSocialists, has acknowledged buying 32,300 shares but claims he hadno inside information. Theret told reporters he tipped Pelat thatTriangle was a good buy.   Many government officials besides Boublil were privy to thePechiney-Triangle deal, which needed Finance Ministry approval. Howthe information was leaked to some buyers, if in fact it was, hasnot become clear.   The stock exchange investigating agency, which says it expects tofinish its probe by the end of January, issued a statement denyingit was the source of the report Le Monde mentioned.   If it finds enough evidence, the commission can give the file toprosecutors for pursuit. It has no power to do more.   Successful prosecutions have been rare in French stock marketcases and even rarer in political scandals, which often fade awayunresolved after capturing the headlines for weeks.   Liberation, a leftist newspaper generally sympathetic to theSocialist government, said Monday the involvement of the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission made it less likely thePechiney-Triangle matter would be covered up.   ``An inquiry leading to the punishment of guilt and complicityaccording to the law remains the only salvation for the shakenauthorities,'' Liberation said. ``This would be unprecedented in thehistory of French scandals.''</TEXT></DOC>
