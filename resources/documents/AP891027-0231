Ten years after Iranian students overranthe U.S. Embassy in Tehran, the issue is no less painful and thesolutions no more clear.</TEXT><BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For the nation that prides itself as themightiest on Earth, hazy television images of Americans heldhostage in the Middle East have become a bitter lesson in thelimits of power.   Few issues have so frustrated the American public and itsleaders since radical Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy inTehran 10 years ago this week _ on Nov. 4, 1979 _ and took 53Americans hostage.   President Bush has toned down the rhetoric in an attempt to keepthe public from focusing too closely on an issue that helped toppleJimmy Carter and led Ronald Reagan into the worst foreign policyscandal of the 1980s.   But at the same time, Bush is enlisting third parties in aneffort to deal with Iran and free the eight Americans now held byIranian-backed Moslems in Lebanon.   Carter, hounded by questions about the Tehran hostages and theUnited States' inability to free them, withdrew to the White HouseRose Garden to wage much of his 1980 re-election campaign.   Those hostages eventually were freed after 444 days _ on the dayReagan was inaugurated, Jan. 20, 1981.   But nearly six years later, Reagan's presidency was rocked bythe Iran-Contra affair, revelations that his aides had sold weaponsto Iran in hopes of freeing the hostages in Lebanon and divertedthe proceeds to Nicaraguan rebels. The arms deals came when Reaganwas proclaiming publicly that the United States would not negotiatefor the hostages' release.   Washington has had no diplomatic relations with Iran since therevolutionary government seized power there in early 1979.   With little fanfare, however, the United States has been usingintermediaries _ Japan, Pakistan, Algeria and Switzerland, to namea few _ to send messages to Tehran, says Gary Sick, author of abook about Carter's hostage crisis and a National Security Councilaide during the Democrat's presidency.   The thrust of Bush's third-party messages is that the UnitedStates is ready for better ties, but the hostages must be freedfirst, analysts say.   ``Bush is conscious of Iran's power and he's shown an interestin putting things right,'' says Frederick Axelgard, a senior fellowat the Center for Strategic and International Studies.   While Bush has tried to play down the hostage issue publicly, hewas forced to react when a group calling itself the Organizationfor the Oppressed on Earth reported on July 31 that it had killedMarine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.   The president cut short a trip to the Midwest and returned toWashington to condemn the ``brutal and tragic'' events, but he didnothing to retaliate.   In Sick's view, Bush simply doesn't have many options.   ``After the Iran-Contra episode, he can't afford to be taggedwith a trade, a deal. In effect, it has tied his hands,'' he says.   Publicly, the administration's position on the hostages is thesame as the Reagan administration's was after the Iran-Contrascandal. Secretary of State James Baker III reiterated that policylast week.   ``The Iranian government has known for a long time that we arequite prepared to have open discussions with representatives ofthat government, provided they renounce their pursuit of terrorismand provided they take actions to seek the release and freedom ofour American hostages,'' he said.   Iran's president, Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, said last weekthat he would help free the American hostages if the United Stateswould release billions of dollars of assets frozen 10 years agoafter the Tehran embassy takeover.   The United States rejects linking the assets, valued at between$9 billion and $12 billion, to the hostages.   U.S. officials say those disputes are, slowly but surely, beingdealt with by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in The Hague,Netherlands. As of August, U.S. nationals had been awarded about$1.2 billion by the tribunal; Iranians had received $118 million,the State Department said.   Despite the stalemate, analysts say a number of factors could,in the long run, help Bush resolve the hostage issue.   Among them: the death this year of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,the hard-line spiritual father of the Iranian revolution, the endof the Iran-Iraq war and the peace plan between Moslems andChristians in Lebanon.   ``If the Lebanese accord works, if Rafsanjani is able tocontinue to consolidate his political base, then we are getting toan atmosphere in which it may be possible for something to takeplace,'' says Judith Kipper, a Middle East expert at the BrookingsInstitution.   Kipper says Rafsanjani's need to rebuild his country and obtaintechnology and economic assistance could lead him to help securethe hostages' release.   In addition, the August 1988 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war hasreduced the perceived threat in the Persian Gulf and allowed theUnited States to cut back its military force there. The Iraniansprobably view that as a positive sign, Sick says.   Maj. Barry Willey of the U.S. Central Command says 10 U.S. shipsremain in the gulf, down from about 17 a year ago.   Complicating the hostage picture, however, is the relationshipbetween Iran and the Lebanese kidnappers, thought to be factions ofthe Hezbollah umbrella group.   Axelgard says there are some signs that Iran has distanceditself from Hezbollah.   But Shaul Bakhash, a professor at George Mason University,disputes that view. Recent visits to Iran by Sheik MohammedFadlallah, spiritual leader of Hezbollah, don't suggest a lesseningof contact between the two, he says.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 29</NOTE></DOC>
