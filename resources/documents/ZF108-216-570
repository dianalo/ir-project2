Should it intermingle with the DOS programs and data? Whatresources are required to run it? What is involved in installing the OS/2operating system software? How should you configure the OS/2 system tosupport LAN-based communications? How do OS/2 applications fit into thepicture?andM;Ed Scannell, who writes for Infoworld, quite accurately described OS/2 as&quot;the eternal beta.&quot; It constantly evolves.andP;  Therefore, any migration strategydemands flexibility.andP;  Within a very short timeframe, we have already seenOS/2 versions 1.0 and 1.1 under Standard and Extended Editions.andP;  IBM hasreleased many Corrective Service Diskettes (CSDs) to rectify a large numberand variety of bugs.andM;Meanwhile, OS/2 EE 1.2 beta tests proceed even as I write this article andrumors abound of an early 80386 OS/2 version in alpha testing on a quiet andvery limited basis.andP;  The forthcoming 80386 OS/2 v. 2.0 family promises manynew OS/2 releases over the next two years.andP;  I've also heard talk of a &quot;lite&quot;OS/2 requiring less RAM and disk storage than the full-featured OS/2.I thinkthis will eventually replace the very mature DOS.andP;  That strategy would resultin de facto acceptance of the OS/2 operating system.andM;In spite of the dynamic evolution, complexity, and bugs, users who work withOS/2 fall in love with it, especially under Presentation Manager on EE 1.1and 1.2.andP;  DOS can no longer satisfy them.andP;  Most impressive are the powerfulnew OS/2 applications such as PageMaker, Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Word,and SQL front end applications.andP;  Presentation Manager and the communicationfeatures of the OS/2 workstation are irresistible lures.andP;  Migration from DOSto OS/2 will soon become commonplace for most upscale business users.andM;The tactical provisions of migrating LAN workstations from DOS to OS/2 arefourfold: 1) take full advantage of OS/2 capabilities, 2) organize DOSworkstation applications not available for OS/2 to run in the DOSCompatibility Box, if possible, 3) provide a DOS boot fall-back provision asa contingency for workstation applications not running under OS/2 or in theDOS Compatibility Box, and 4) find a way to back up the OS/2 workstation.andM;Resource RequirementsandM;According to the IBM pamphlet in the OS/2 EE 1.1 documentation set,Installing OS/2 Extended Edition,&quot; the following minimum hardware andsoftware are needed to support OS/2 EE 1.1:andM;* An IBM PS/2 or PC with an 80286 processor, such as Models 30-286, 50, 5OZ,55,60, 70, or 80; an IBM PC-AT; or an IBM PC-XT Model 286.andM;*  3MB of RAM.andM;*  20MB of fixed disk storage space.andM;*  A LAN adapter, if the computer will be a LAN workstation.andM;*  One or more communications adapters, if using the Communications Manager.andM;*  A modem, for remote communications.andM;*  A high capacity diskette drive, either 5 1/4 or 3 1/2 inch.andM;*  A keyboard, display, and display adapter.andM;In reality, these resources are a bit skimpy.andP;  A fast PS/2 should have atleast 4MB of RAM.andP;  The PC-AT should have a minimum of 5MB to 6MB of RAM tocompensate for its slower processor, RAM, and disk drive.andP;  When OS/2 startsto swap-out from RAM to disk, the PC-AT workstation comes to a halt.andO;Swapping out is not a problem for fast PS/2s.andP;  A 6 MHz PC-AT with a 20MB harddisk is a bit too slow and limited in disk storage for OS/2 EE 1.1 in myjudgement.andP;  But you can adapt the 8 MHz PC-AT with a 30MB hard disk to OS/2EE 1.1 surprisingly well.andM;A hard disk with only 20MB of disk space is also inadequate since the OS/2 EE1.1 software will practically take up all of the disk.andP;  In order to run OS/2EE 1.1 on an 8 M Hz PC-AT with a 30MB hard drive, I had to relocate most ofmy local application programs and data to a file server.andP;  While myworkstation philosophy advocates using server storage rather than localworkstation disks as much as possible, I think that a 60MB local hard driveis appropriate for an OS/2 EE 1.1 workstation.andM;Therefore, any 80286 OS/2 EE 1.1 workstation should have at least a 10 or 12MHz processor and minimum local disk storage of 40MB to 60MB.andP;  While thefaster 80286-based computers have sufficient processor horsepower for runningOS/2, 80 computers should be purchased 'instead, if at all possible, giventhat the 80386SX models are so reasonably priced.andM;My OS/2-LAN enthusiast friends on Wall Street prefer fast 80386 or 80486based workstations with local hard drives in excess of 100MB.andP;  They know thatthe forthcoming 80386 versions of OS/2 (v.andP;  2.0) will require 80386processors, so the future migration to the most powerful and feature richversions of OS/2 will diverge from to 80286.andP;  The 100MB-plus local diskoffers a lot of utilitarian value to aggressive workstation users.andM;Don't forget the mouse.andP;  The PM interface without a mouse is a nuisance touse because of the cumbersome and illogical keystrokes required.andP;  All OS/2workstations running PM must have one to reap the operating efficiency of thePM interface.andP;  Migration OverviewandM;In migrating our hypothetical LAN workstation f rom DOS to OS/2 EE 1.1, wewill go sequentially through the following steps in detail: @Relocate all ofthe programs and data in the DOS partition on the workstation C: drive, ifthat partition runs under DOS 3.30 (or below).andM;* Build a DOS boot floppy as a fall back for running DOS applications thatare important to the workstation user.andM;* Install the OS/2 Base Operating System software.andM;* Install the OS/2 Extension software modules, i.e., Communications Manager,LAN Requester, and Data Base Manager.andM;* Apply the latest IBM CSD for OS/2 EE 1.1.andM;Relocating DOSandM;OS/2 EE 1.1 installs to the C: partition, where most of the user's DOSprograms and data probably now reside.andP;  The most likely problem here will beinsufficient space in the partition for both the DOS and OS/2 files.andP;  Usersgenerally load up the C: drive with programs and data before expanding toother workstation drives.andM;DOS 3.30 users normally have their disk divided into 32MB partitions.andP;  In themigration of a DOS 3.30 workstation from DOS to OS/2, I usually XCOPY the DOSprograms and data from the C: to the D: drive.andP;  That gives OS/2 an entire32MB partition to take over.andP;  If the workstation does not have enough localdisk storage to support the XCOPY maneuver, then you must move the files toshared storage devices on the LAN.andM;Users running DOS 4.01 have more options open.andP;  Since the size of aworkstation disk partition is no longer limited to 32MB, the partition canhold both OS/2 and DOS file sets.andP;  A PS/2 with a 115MB hard disk may beconfigured with the full 115MB in a single partition.andP;  This doesn't solve thedilemma of co-mingling DOS and OS/2 files, however.andM;Beginning with OS/2 v. 1.2, workstation partitions will use either 1) thefile allocation table (FAT) file system of DOS or 2) a new High PerformanceFile System (HPFS) which can not be locally accessed under DOS.andP;  in otherwords, partitions using the new OS/2 non-FAT file systems, such as the HPFSof v. 1.2, will likely be inaccessible under DOS.andP;  This might change infuture releases of DOS, such as DOS 4.10, but we have no way of knowing forsure until that happens.andM;in formulating our migration strategy, we must never forget that OS/2 willcontinue to evolve very rapidly.andP;  Flexibility in the workstation is veryimportant.andP;  New installable file systems (IFS) in the OS/2 environment may ormay not be fully compatible with DOS or with each other.andM;For now, I have been dedicating a partition to DOS if possible, and likewiseI anticipate having multiple partitions on the workstation in the future toaccommodate different file systems, such as HPFS-286 and HPFS-386.andP;  Separatepartitions are also very helpful for isolated testing of newly released filesystems.andM;With IBM OS/2 EE 1.1, users must boot DOS off a floppy disk.andP;  The MicrosoftOS/2 dual boot option was removed by IBM.andP;  A dual boot option gives the usera choice of booting from either DOS or OS/2 upon initialization of theworkstation.andP;  Once OS/2 EE 1.1 is installed, the workstation hard dis willonly boot OS/2.andP;  IBM's 0 will supposedly bring back the dual boot option,effectively making it unnecessary to use a DOS boot floppy.andM;Since the DOS based workstation was XCOPYed from C: to D: you must considerthe impact of the change 'in drives.andP;  An elaborate DOS based workstationusually has the drive designation hard coded in numerous BAT files, menu orwindows based workstation commands, scripts, environmental variables (such asPATH and COMSPEC), etc.andP;  After booting off the DOS floppy, use the followingcommands to adjust the DOS workstation software to the D: drive.andM;SET COMSPEC = D:\DOS\COMMAND.COMandM;ASSIGN C = DandM;COMSPEC tells the operating system to reload the command processor from theD: drive rather than from the boot floppy in A:.andP;  ASSIGN instructs DOS toroute all disk I/O requests for C: to D:.andP;  All BAT files and otherworkstation commands with hard coded C: do not have to be changed.andP;  The DOSworkstation will run f lawlessly f rom the D: drive.andM;Figure two shows examples of the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS from the DOSboot floppy of a hypothetical OS/2 EE 1.1 workstation.andP;  Notice that the SHELLin the CONFIG.SYS file points to the same command processor as COMSPEC.andO;Remember that we booted off a floppy in the A: drive, so COMSPEC =A:\COMMAND.COM until we change it in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file's second line.andO;Also, notice that the execution of ASSIGN C D comes after initializing theLAN workstation software via the NET START line.andP;  The DOS workstation in theexample happens to use the IBM PC LAN operating system.andM;In the migration from DOS to OS/2, technical support personnel or the usermust first ensure that the workstation functions fully after relocation ofthe DOS files formerly stored in the C: partition.andP;  Thoroughly test theworkstation, booting off the DOS floppy and running from the D: partition,before installing  additional OS/2 software.andM;OS/2 Base OperatingandM;System installationandM;installing the OS/2 EE 1.1 software is fairly straightforward.andP;  The baseoperating system alone needs about 8,510,000 bytes of disk space for its 207user files, three hidden files, and six directories.andM;After copying the DOS files from the C: partition to the D: partition andtesting all DOS operations, boot off the OS/2 installation diskette in the A:drive and follow the instructions displayed.andP;  I always select the option toreformat the C: partition.andP;  The reformating removes the DOS files from C: aswell as initializing and preparing the partition for the OS/2 software.andP;  SomeOS/2 files are copied from the installation diskette.andP;  The first part of theBase Operating System installation ends when the system requests theinstaller to remove the installation diskette from drive A: and reboot.andM;Next, the OS/2 system initializes from the C: drive for the first time, andasks the installer to insert diskettes into drive A:, one by one.andP;  The systemrequests diskettes one through four if using 5 1/4 inch floppies.andP;  Files arecopied to the C: partition from the floppies.andP;  An option screen allowsinstallation of device drivers from a Device Support Diskette; an InstallDevice Drivers menu facilitates automatic installation of non-IBM devicedrivers or IBM device drivers not included with the OS/2 EE 1.1 package.andO;Screens also appear for selecting country and keyboard, mouse, and serialdevice support.andM;The system will be configured using the most commonly installed features andconfiguration settings as defaults.andP;  The installer may review defaultsettings to accept or change them.andP;  After the installer accepts theconfiguration settings, the system completes installation of the baseoperating system.andP;  The installer then removes the last floppy and reboots theworkstation.andP;  OS/2 initializes off the C: drive and brings up the StartPrograms window, the DOS Compatibility Box, the Print Spooler, and the TaskManager.andM;Start Programs shows the Main Group, which is a kind of Presentation Managermain menu or main window.andP;  At inception, the main group of Start Programsoffers four selections: a File System utility, the Introducing OS/2 onlinetutorial, OS/2 full-screen command prompt, and OS/2 windowed command prompt.andO;A second group, called Utility Programs, includes Control Panel,  DiskInformationCHKDSK, Format Diskette, and OS/2 System Editor.andM;We now have a working OS/2 workstation, although there will not be any LAN,communication, or database functionalities until after the installation ofthe proper Extension modules.andM;Installation of the OS/2andM;Extension ModulesandM;The next steps are to run individual installation jobs for the OS/2 Extensionmodules: Communications Manager, LAN Requester, and Data Base Manager.andM;The Extension modules conform to IBM's full screen System ApplicationArchitecture (SAA) interface and support the mouse pointing device.andP;  However,they are not yet PM applications that will run in windows.andM;In addition, I always install Borland's SideKick, which comes packaged withinthe OS/2 EE 1.1 shrink-wrap as though it were meant to be one of theExtensions.andP;  SideKick for OS/2 EE 1.1 is an example of a real PM application.andM;Comms ManagerandM;All IBM OS/2 EE 1.1 communications functionality stems from theCommunications (Comms) Manager.andP;  The Comms Manager software installs into theC:\CMLIB subdirectory.andP;  After double clicking on the OS/2 full screen commandprompt, entering CMINST at the OS/2 prompt [C:\] starts the installationprocess.andP;  Reinstallation of the Comms Manager at a later time requiresCMINSTM.andM;The installer may choose between two different methods of installation:Prompted Mode or Full Function Mode.andP;  Novices should use Prompted Mode whichrequires a minimum number of decisions.andP;  In reality, most users havedifficulty installing and configuring OS/2 EE 1.1, and usually require expertassistance-configuration of the Comms Manager is unquestionably the mostcomplex part of the OS/2 EE 1.1 installation process.andM;The menu-driven Prompted Mode installs the Comms Manager base code, copiesthe user configuration files or the IBM-supplied configuration files, andinstalls the features that are specified in those configuration files.andP;  Theinstaller always has the option of modifying the Comms Manager configurationfile after completing  installation.andM;Full Function Mode is also menu-driven.andP;  It requires the installer to selectdifferent communication functions, specify the details of theirconfiguration, and indicate the order of execution for functions.andP;  Theinstaller must be prepared to provide a lot of detailed technicalinformation.andM;I generally recommend Prompted Mode rather than Full Function Mode, since itis so easy to get into trouble configuring the Comms Manager.andP;  However, theconfiguration resulting from the Prompted Mode installation will need to befine-tuned later.andM;After selecting Prompted Mode off the Install menu, the system prompts theinstaller for OS/2 EE 1.1 diskettes in order to copy the Comms Managersoftware to the C: drive.andP;  With 5 1/4 inch floppies, diskettes five and sixare requested.andP;  The menu selection, &quot;Copy the user configuration files,&quot;provides an opportunity to input customized Comms Manager configurationfiles.andP;  The system administrator or technical support specialist shouldsupply customized files, tailored for a particular group of users in advance.andM;Without custom configuration files the Comms Manager selects &quot;Copy the IBMconfiguration files.&quot; After copying the IBM configuration files to the C:drive, the menu selection &quot;Complete the installation&quot; finishes the job.andP;  Thehistory file C:\CMLIB\ACSINSUM.DAT provides a summary of current installationdata, including time and date installed, file names, and directory pathnames.andM;The program title &quot;Communications Manager&quot; now appears in the Main Group listof the Start programs window.andP;  However, the Comms Manager will not functionwithout adding the proper device driver statements to the CONFIG.SYS file andthen rebooting the workstation.andM;LAN RequesterandM;The LAN Requester allows the workstation to perform LAN functions on an IBMToken Ring or IBM PC Network.andP;  Through it you can access LAN resources, suchas disks, printers, and serial devices.andP;  In addition, it can define, control,and manage access to LAN resources.andM;The LAN Requester files install into the subdirectory tree off \IBMLAN.andP;  itis the only OS/2 EE 1.1 module which allows installation on a drive otherthan C:.andP;  OS/2 EE 1.2 provides more flexibility for installation of the OS/2Extension modules.andM;To begin, enter REQINST at the OS/2 full screen command prompt.andP;  Do not runany other programs in the DOS Compatibility Box or another IBM OS/2 sessionduring installation.andP;  When asked, specify the drive and indicate whether ornot to install the Online Reference and Help panels on the local drive.andP;  Iusually install them.andM;With 5 1/4 inch floppies, the installation job requests OS/2 diskettes nine,10, and 11.andP;  The system copies the files and asks for the LAN Requester name,the Domain name, and then the requester services to initialize when the LANRequester starts.andP;  I usually specify all of the available services: Messengerand Message Pop-up.andP;  Last, select the type of network adapter: PC Network(all), Token Ring Network 16/4, Token Ring Network /A or PC Adapter 11, andToken Ring Network Adapter 1.andM;LAN Messaging and LAN Requester now appear in the Main Group list of theStart Programs window.andP;  You can display or print a history file of theinstallation.andM;Now you have to reinitialize the workstation to activate the appropriatedevice drivers before starting the LAN Requester.andP;  During the installationprocess, device drivers for LAN communications (LANDD.SYS, TRNETDD.SYS andNETBDD.SYS for the Token Ring Network) were automatically installed in theCONFIG.SYS file.andP;  They specify the default configuration file for the LANRequester, C:\IBMLAN\REQBASE.CFG.andP;  This configuration file works with the LANRequester but not the Comms Manager, which requires a different configurationfile.andM;Later you must edit the CONFIG.SYS file to replace the \path\ REQBASE.CFGwith the proper Comms Manager configuration path and file name.andP;  Normally,the Comms Manager configuration file supports both the Comms Manager and theLAN Requester.andM;The installation process included other CONFIG.SYS entries, as well: 1) adevice driver providing an interface for the LAN Requester (NETWKSTA.SYS)that specifies an initialization parameter file called IBMLAN.INI, and 2) astatement allowing use of the Token Ring system process through the adapterhandler, RUN C:CMLIB\ ACSTRSYS.EXE.andP;  The Token Ring system process loads whenthe workstation boots if it finds this statement in the CONFIG.SYS file.andP;  InOS/2, you can use the RUN command to start executable system programs fromthe CONFIG.SYS file.andM;With the Base Operating System, Comms Manager and LAN Requester installed,approximately 19,270,000 bytes of OS/2 files and 12 directories reside in the32MB C: partition.andM;Database ManagerandM;The Database Manager consists of two components: Database Services and QueryManager.andP;  Database Services is described as the engine of the DatabaseManager-the implementation of the relational data model as well as the basefunctions and configuration files needed to use the Database Manager.andP;  QueryManager provides panels and menus to guide the user through databaseoperations, i.e., creating databases, editing data, and generating reports.andO;In addition, Query Manager configures Database Services.andM;Install Database Services to drive C: in the directory C:\SQLLIB before theQuery Manager.andP;  Enter DSINST at the OS/2 full screen command prompt [C:\].andO;As before, the program requests OS/2 floppies by number.andP;  With 5 1/4 inchfloppies, DSINST asks for diskette seven.andP;  Copying these files completes theinstallation.andM;Afterward, edit the CONFIG.SYS file to set the environmental variable SQLUSERto a unique identifier of eight characters or less.andP;  Database Manager willassign the default, NULLID, otherwise.andM;Query Manager is optional but I recommend installing it.andP;  At the OS/2 fullscreen command prompt, enter QMINST to begin the installation job.andP;  Using 51/4 inch floppies, OS/2 requests diskettes eight and nine to copy files toC:\SQLLIB.andP;  The program title Query Manager&quot; will appear in the Main Grouplist of the Start Programs window now.andP;  The Database Services installationalone did not place an entry in the Main Group list.andP;  Again, a history filemay be viewed and/or printed.andM;The disk now has all OS/2 EE 1.1 modules: Approximately 24,720,000 bytes in654 user files, three hidden files, and 13 directories.andP;  No applications orutility programs have been locally installed yet.andM;SideKickandM;SideKick provides a good example of how a software product can install intothe PM interface.andP;  Start with [A:\]SETUP A: C:.andP;  Parm %1 is the floppy drivefrom where the programs will be installed.andP;  Parm %2 following SETUP is thedrive on which SideKick will be installed, and may be set to drives otherthan C:.andP;  After the installation begins, two informational screens appear.andO;Next, the system copies SideKick files to the hard disk and installs SideKickinto the PM interface as the third group of Start Programs.andP;  The 5 1/4 inchversion of SideKick has two floppies.andP;  When the installation is complete, theprogram instructs the installer to remove the last floppy and reboot theworkstation.andM;Now approximately 26,900,000 bytes of files fill the C: partition, consistingof 688 user files, three hidden files and 19 directories.andP;  The softwareinstallation off floppies from Base Services through SideKick takes a bitless than two hours.andM;Applying the Latest CSDandM;The installer should apply a CSD release after the OS/2 software has beeninstalled.andP;  IBM will continue to issue a lot of OS/2 CSDs.andP;  Each CSD is anaccumulation of fixes, including those from prior CSDs.andP;  Beware that some ofthe IBM CSDs have introduced new &quot;bugs.&quot; While the latest CSD at this time isCSD 3072, 1 have only applied CSDs through 3042.andM;On 5 1/4 inch floppies, CSD 3042 consists of an installation diskette plusseven floppies and takes about 30 minutes to install.andP;  The installer bootsthe workstation off the CSD installation floppy.andP;  You can indicate which diskdrives the CSD should not update, and whether or not to bypass anysubdirectories on the drives to be updated.andP;  The CSD must run withoutinterruption.andP;  The installer merely changes CSD floppies, as instructed bythe installation program, until finished.andP;  The file C:\FIXLOG.OS2 contains alog of the latest CSD update.andM;Warning: when applying a CSD after the initial installation, IBM default CFGfiles for the Comms Manager will be overlayed.andP;  Configuring the Comms Managercan be a pain, so backup or rename any CFG files in use that have beencustomized.andM;After the application of CSD 3042, total storage in use on drive C: exceeded27,000,000 bytes !andP;  Still to ComeandM;In this first part we discussed a proven method of installing OS/2 softwareon a LAN workstation.andP;  Building on this first step, next month I will coverthe configuration issues of OS/2, the Communications Manager and the LANRequester.andP;  I will also explain how to install OS/2 applications and set upthe DOS Compatibility Box and the OS/2 NetWare Requester.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
