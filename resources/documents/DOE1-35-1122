Thus, in the reportthe authors describe and evaluate the state of published mathematicalmodels of air quality and vegetation response. The authors also identifythe limitations in these models and describe some basic biological andstatistical concepts of plant-response processes useful in experimentaldesign toward a new and progressive approach to the problem analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
