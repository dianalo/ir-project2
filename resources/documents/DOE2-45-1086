Dots as well as lineshave been formed. Tungsen deposits analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopycontained 48% tungsten, 40% carbon, and 12% oxygen. A resistivity of0.01 {Omega}cm for the deposits was measured by aligning the STM to ametal contact pattern. This is the first reported combination of STMlithography with conventional lithography. A discussion of several interestingphysical and chemical mechanisms involved in the deposition process isalso presented.</TEXT></DOC>
