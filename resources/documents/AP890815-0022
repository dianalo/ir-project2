A conciliatory statement issued Monday in Washington and Tunisiasought to repair the recent rift between the Bush administration andYasser Arafat's group while also urging the PLO to approve anIsraeli election plan.   The statement by U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau Jr. said theUnited States seeks a settlement based on Israel giving up territoryin exchange for peace. Also listed as ``firm principles'' in theU.S. statement were ``security and recognition for Israel andPalestinian political rights.''   The statement did not say how those rights would be expressed.   ``Our immediate task ... is to find a practical means totranslate these principles into political reality,'' it said.   The PLO demands a state on the Israeli-held West Bank and inGaza. U.S. policy opposes statehood, and would have Israel andPalestinians negotiate an arrangement acceptable to both sides.   ``The Palestinians should have a chance to determine their ownfuture in negotiations with Israel as well as to run their dailyaffairs,'' said a U.S. official who demanded anonymity.   Meanwhile, Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, pledgedthe United States would keep talking to the PLO to try to getnegotiations started.   ``We don't expect a breakthrough in each particular meeting,''Boucher said in announcing that the talks begun last December hadresumed in Tunisia. ``It's an ongoing process.''   The department last month accused the PLO of attachingunacceptable conditions to its provisional approval of an Israeliproposal for elections on the West Bank and in Gaza. One was thedemand for statehood.   The Bush administration supports the Israeli proposal to chooseelected Palestinian representatives for negotiations as the best wayto get talks started. The PLO, however, has denounced the proposalas a ploy to block Palestinian statehood.   Last week, the department again criticized Arafat's organization.Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said a statement adopted by Fatah, themain PLO faction, raised questions about the PLO's ``commitment toaccommodation, understanding and peace.''   Delegates to a Fatah meeting in Tunis, where the PLO maintainsits headquarters, had approved a resolution calling for``intensification of the armed struggle and all other forms ofbattle to put an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinianterritories.''   On Monday, the department took a different approach through bothspokesman Boucher and envoy Pelletreau.   Boucher said Pelletreau had met in Tunisia with a PLO delegationheaded by Yasser Abd-Rabboo and again sought ``a positivePalestinian response'' to the Israeli election proposal.   ``We continue to believe that through an Israeli-Palestiniandialogue progress can be achieved in moving the process forward toelections and peace negotiations,'' he said.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, while disapproving of U.S.talks with the PLO, proposed elections to select Palestinians whowould negotiate temporary and limited self-rule with Israel. Afterfive years, Israel, Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan would negotiatean overall settlement of the Arab-Israeli dispute.   The lengthy statement by Pelletreau called Monday's session``serious and probing'' while offering assurances to the PLO thatthe Bush administration seeks to foster political rights forPalestinians.   ``There is a road to peace in the Middle East,'' it said. ``Weare suggesting that the next, but not the last, milestone on thatroad is an election in the occupied territories.''   In Tunis, Abd-Rabboo said he expected the discussions to continuein ``the near future'' and said an international peace conferencewas ``the best introduction to establish an effective peace.''</TEXT></DOC>
