<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-19-0248 </DOCNO><TEXT>DLTS and MCTS studies are reported for boron-doped (about 3.5 x 10{sup15}cm{sup -3}) pulled silicon specimens which have been subjected toelectron irradiation at 1.5 MeV at about 80 K. A number of previouslyreported and identified features are observed and two new peaks are reported,the first possibly dependent on oxygen content at an energy level ofabout Esub(v) + 0.13 eV and with a capture cross section of about 10{sup-18} cm{sup 2}, the second with a charge-dependent peak amplitude atan energy of Esub(v) + 0.34 eV-apparently a vacancy-dependent complexannealing out at around room temperature.</TEXT></DOC>
