(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Experience in Software Inc.andM;IDEA GENERATOR PLUS 3.1andM;Idea Generator Plus is based on a logical three-step approach to problemsolving.andP;  First, the user enters a problem into the program and works onclarifying it by answering questions generated by the program.andP;  Then, newideas are cultivated when the user answers another series of questions thathelps put the problem or situation into a new perspective.andM;Finally, the user evaluates and prioritizes these ideas based on the originalgoals.andP;  This gives the user the opportunity to prune or discard less usefulideas or solutions, and to rate the remaining ideas on the basis of costs,benefits and the effects on people involved in the process.andM;The program's analytical question-and-answer setup makes sense, but it'stime-consuming.andP;  This makes Idea Generator more suitable for analyzingproblems that must be solved using highly structured reasoning.andM;Not all of Idea Generator's questions are applicable to every problem, andmany of its questions are difficult to answer.andM;For example, the program asks the user to list goals and then reverse them(in order of importance, for example), and then to consider ways to reach thereversed goals.andM;Finally, the program asks the user to try to determine whether the plans toachieve the reversed goals provide any insight into new ways to reach theinitial goals.andM;For example, a user may choose a car on the basis of two criteria: style andprice.andP;  By reversing the priority of these goals, the user may considerdifferent options, one or more of which could satisfy the original goals.andM;On the downside, answering Idea Generator's questions does not guarantee thatusers will break out of their original thinking patterns; it is easy toanswer the program's questions based on past ideas or assumptions.andM;In addition, Idea Generator's questions require careful consideration.andO;During testing, PC Week Labs took several hours to work through the broadrange of questions that were relevant to the test problem.andP;  Nevertheless,thinking about the problem from different perspectives helped the reviewerbreak away from circular thinking patterns.andM;A useful feature is the Idea Screen, which tracks the user's train ofthought.andP;  The Idea Screen can be accessed via a hot key at any time.andP;  Itincorporates a text editor to record new ideas, associations and conclusions.andM;Idea Generator provides a useful summary report that includes a descriptionof the situation, a list of the people involved and ratings of theindividual's or group's goals, in order of importance.andM;The information in the summary report can be printed out or exported toapplications such as Symantec Corp.'s GrandView, ThinkTank and Ready, as wellas Lotus Development Corp.'s Agenda.andM;------------------&quot;VITAL SIGNS&quot; DATAandM;Experience in Software Inc.andM;Berkeley, Calif.andP;  (800) 678-7008;andM;(415) 644-0694andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1983andM;Number of employees: 5andM;Gross annual revenue: Not disclosedandM;Gross annual earnings: Not disclosedandM;Source.andP;  Information supplied by company.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
