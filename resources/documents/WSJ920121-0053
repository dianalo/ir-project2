Genzyme said the discovery eventually will lead to theproduction of large quantities of the protein, known ascystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, as well as othertherapeutic proteins. The technique harnesses transgenicmice, animals which have been altered as embryos in a waythat causes them to produce specific proteins in the milk oflactating females.</LP><TEXT>   The cystic fibrosis-related protein has up to now beenvery difficult to produce in large quantities, theresearchers said. The new transgenic production techniqueshould speed progress in cystic fibrosis treatment research,the scientists said.   The report is the latest use of transgenic animals toproduce drugs in milk. Scientists expect transgenictechniques eventually will lead to commercial &quot;pharming,&quot; orusing herds of animals as living pharmaceutical factories.Pharming is expected to give the biotechnology industry acheaper, better way to make genetically engineered drugs nowmade in vats by bacteria and other microbes that have beenaltered to produce human proteins.</TEXT></DOC>
