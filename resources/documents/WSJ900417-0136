But management fell far short in itsattempt to defeat three Simmons-supported ballot measures.   The annual meeting was briefly reconvened yesterday toformally announce the ballot results. Afterward, DanielTellep, Lockheed's chairman, and Vincent N. Marafino, vicechairman and chief financial officer, had lunch with Mr.Simmons and his top strategist, J. Landis Martin.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Simmons presented Mr. Tellep with a five-page letteroutlining the stockholder's recommendations for the company.The letter apparently covered most of the issues raised inthe proxy battle.   Lockheed declined to discuss the meeting and the letter.   The ballot results, preliminary indications of which weregiven by Lockheed a week ago, mark the end of a bitter proxyfight. Mr. Simmons, a Dallas investor who controls 18.9% ofthe nation's sixth-largest defense contractor, has said hisforces spent considerably more than $6 million pushing theirslate. Lockheed spent about $8 million.   Lockheed said that of the 52.7 million shares voted,incumbent Lockheed directors received between 57.6% and60.7%; nominees of Mr. Simmons' Houston-based NL IndustriesInc. got 36.9%.   However, three measures to increase shareholder rights,one of which was proposed by NL Industries and the other twosupported by it, were approved with favorable votes of 54% to61%.   A Lockheed bylaw amendment to exempt the company fromantitakeover provisions of the Delaware corporate law won ona 61% to 37% vote, with 2% abstaining. A recommendation forLockheed to adopt confidential voting procedures won 60% to38%. And NL Industries' proposal that Lockheed redeem itsshareholder-rights plan passed 54% to 41%.   Mr. Tellep didn't comment on the approval of the threemeasures management had opposed, but he said &quot;the decidedmargin of victory for the incumbent board of directors givesus a clear mandate to go forward&quot; with current corporateplans.</TEXT></DOC>
