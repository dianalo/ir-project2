Paul A. Yost Jr., commandantof the Coast Guard, told a House subcommittee.   Yost said the Reagan administration's proposed fiscal 1989funding level of $2.98 billion would not enable the Coast Guard toreopen any of the nearly 30 stations and offices closed in Februarybecause of a $103 million shortfall in the current budget.   But Yost said the administration's proposal would allow theremaining stations to stay open. In addition, it would restore tofull levels drug patrols, which were reduced by 55 percent lastmonth, and routine search and rescue patrols, which were eliminated.   If Congress approved a budget with only modest increases from1988, the agency would have a $171 million shortfall next year thatwould trigger a more serious round of station closings, Yost said.   ``I can't even come up with a list of Coast Guard (facilities)that could be closed,'' he said.   Rep. Earl Hutto, D-Fla., chairman of the House Merchant Marineand Fisheries subcommittee on the Coast Guard and navigation,embraced the administration's budget proposal as ``the minimumnecessary for the Coast Guard to continue to function in the mannerexpected of it by the Congress and the American public.''   Hutto and Yost said while the 1989 budget request is a big jumpfrom current spending levels, it really would just be bringing theCoast Guard up to past levels.   When adjusted for inflation, the budget request for the nextfiscal year is about the same as the 1983 spending levels. However,the Coast Guard since has increased its drug interdictionactivities substantially.   The congressional General Accounting Office found that from 1980to 1987, the proportion of Coast Guard operating expenses devotedto drug operations more than tripled _ from 7 percent to 22 percent.   Meanwhile, the percentage devoted to more traditional CoastGuard duties, such as search and rescue patrols and marine safety,has been sliced from 60 percent to 51 percent, the GAO said.   Last week, Yost unveiled an administration plan to transer $60million from other Transportation Department accounts to the CoastGuard to immediately upgrade patrol levels to last year's levels.</TEXT></DOC>
