The official news agency Tass quoted Deputy Prosecutor VladimirKravtsev as saying the allegations that Ligachev accepted a bribewere ``an attempted frame-up and an invention not supported by anyobjective evidence.''   The charges surfaced in May, when an investigator in theprosecutor's office said in a televised debate among parliamentarycandidates that Ligachev's name came up in a probe of corruption inthe Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan.   The investigator, Nikolai Ivanov, did not detail Ligachev'sinvolvement.   The probe into the corruption charges against Ligachev has beendropped, Kravtsev told Tass.   According to Tass, former Uzbek Communist Party chief InamzhonUsmankhodzhayev initially claimed to have bribed Ligachev, ``butlater withdrew the testimony.''   Usmankhodzhayev is under investigation in a sweeping corruptionprobe involving high-level officials in Uzbekistan, Tass said.   He named Ligachev under pressure from investigators and thethreat that his relatives would be arrested, Tass reported. Ivanov'sboss, investigator Telman Gdlyan, ordered Usmankhodzhayev to testifythat he bribed law enforcement officials and members of the party'spolicy-making Central Committee, according to Tass.   On May 15, Ligachev dismissed the accusations as slander andprovocation and asked for an investigation.   Ivanov and Gdlyan have been pulled off the Uzbek case, which ledto the conviction of former President Leonid I. Brezhnev'sson-in-law, Yuri Churbanov, on corruption charges.   Both investigators were elected to the new Soviet parliament, theCongress of People's Deputies in spring balloting.</TEXT></DOC>
