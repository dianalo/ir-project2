Polls closed with less than half the eligible voters in twoprovinces casting ballots, election officials estimated. Anopposition party immediately claimed fraud.   The policeman was killed and six others wounded in two attackson polling places in the village of Mattugama, 35 miles southeastof Colombo, police said.   At Dullewa, 65 miles northeast of Colombo, gunmen jumped twopoliceman who had been watching a polling place. The assailantstied the officers to a tree and stole their automatic rifles butdid not harm them, a police spokesman said.   Late Wednesday, an airman was killed by suspected Sinhaleseradicals who ambushed his car, the spokesman said on condition ofanonymity.   The deputy elections commissioner, Lakshman Perera, told TheAssociated Press that less than 50 percent of the 3.6 millioneligible voters in the Central and Western provinces cast ballots.   Results were not expected until Friday.   The voting for provincial councils, in its second round today,was called for under last July's peace accord to end the 5-year-oldrevolt by militant Tamil separatists.   The nationalist Sinhalese Liberation Front insists the accordmakes too many concessions to the minority Tamils and opposes thecouncils, which are designed to give more autonomy to the provinces.   Tamils dominate the Northern and Eastern provinces, wherepolling has been postponed because of fear of violence by Tamilseparatists.   Tamils, most of whom are Hindu, comprise 18 percent of thisisland nation's 16 million people. They claim discrimination by themostly Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population.   The rest are descendants of Christian colonialists or Moslemtraders.   On Wednesday, nationalist Sinhalese gangs burned down more than15 government buildings, torched six buses and three trains andkilled a policeman in a bid to disrupt today's balloting.   They also put up posters threatening to kill anyone who votedand any shopkeepers who opened their stores for the next 36 hours.   The government responded by tightening security and orderingsecurity personnel to ``shoot on sight'' anyone ``engaged in thedestruction of public property.''   The voters cast ballots today for 158 lawmakers from 585candidates fielded by the governing United National Party, theLiberal Party, Sri Lanka People's Party and Moslem Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
