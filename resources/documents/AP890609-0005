However, a source with the Senate Judiciary Committee denied thatthe staff is seeking that many documents.   ``We have not asked for something broad, but for something prettynarrow ... but apparently the way the records are kept, they're in amuch broader category,'' said the source, who spoke only oncondition of anonymity. ``We might want perhaps 10 pages out of 100,but they'll give us 100.''   Among the requested items are unpublished decisions in Michiganstate courts, the source said, adding, ``The only way to get them isto have him (Lucas) find them.''   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh questioned Judiciary CommitteeChairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., about the requests Wednesdaynight when Thornburgh spoke to the Delaware State Bar Association.   ``He said something like, `They're asking for a lot of stuff,'''and he urged Biden to schedule Lucas' confirmation hearings as soonas possible, Runkel said.   The committee source said the department has assured thecommittee that it will cooperate in providing documents and saidBiden has said repeatedly that he has no interest in delaying thehearing and hopes it can be held before the July 4 holiday.   Runkel said the committee is seeking such things as employmentrecords and court documents ``on cases that may have been filed inwhich he, as a public official, may have been a defendant.''   Lucas, who is working for the Justice Department as a $284-a-dayconsultant while awaiting Senate confirmation, did not respond tophone calls seeking comment.   Some civil rights groups have opposed his nomination, saying helacks legal experience, particularly on civil rights. On his Senatequestionnaire, Lucas said he has never tried a case in court sincehe entered private legal practice in Detroit two years ago.   Prior to private practice, Lucas had served as sheriff and chiefexecutive of Wayne County, Mich.   A black Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Michigan governorin 1986, Lucas had been a lifelong Democrat before joining the GOPin 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
