Yesterday, as the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks rose 0.31 to 382.38 for its seventh small gain in a row, Silicon Graphics and Index Technology joined this summer's list of big OTC technology stocks to report disappointing earnings and then watch their stocks and others skid.    Just a few days ago, OTC traders were saying they had their fingers crossed, hoping that a week or two without negative news from a big technology company would be just the thing to spur an OTC rally.    Silicon Graphics tumbled 1 1/4 to 14 1/2 after the maker of visual computing workstations said it expects record bookings but flat revenue for its first quarter, ending Sept. 30. In the previous quarter, revenue was $46 million. Despite the flat sales, Silicon Graphics said spending to support the marketing of new products will continue as planned.    Index Technology, meanwhile, plunged 2 1/4 to 8, the biggest percentage fall on Nasdaq, after the developer of software engineering products said third-quarter will be &quot;below expectations.&quot; The Cambridge, Mass., company had sales of $5.9 million in the 1987 third quarter and $7.5 million in this year's second quarter.    Index Technology went public in June at $12 a share; yesterday's close is its low point.    Although announcements such as yesterday's aren't disastrous for the companies' fundamental outlooks, they tell investors that they &quot;have to be wary and very, very careful&quot; with technology stocks these days, said Jerry Newman, head of OTC trading at Hambrecht andamp; Quist, a brokerage and investment-banking firm in San Francisco that took Index Technology public.    &quot;The over-the-counter technology stocks in general are still in an oversold condition,&quot; he said, &quot;but because you've got some stocks that still have problems -- such as a Silicon Graphics, such as an Index -- most of the clients will back away until there's a consensus that the group as a whole isn't going to have a problem child or two a day.&quot;    It didn't help the OTC market that the Silicon Graphics and Index Technology announcements came on a generally down day for Wall Street. Other big Nasdaq technology stocks were also lower most of the day before bouncing up in sympathy with a recovery on the New York Stock Exchange.    For example, Intel ended unchanged at 28, and Apple Computer finished unchanged at 41. The Nasdaq 100 index of the largest non-financial OTC issues, after being down as much as 2.58, ended with a gain of 0.55 at 351.74, though many smaller issues didn't have a chance to catch up before the close.    Both the Nasdaq composite and the Nasdaq 100 were down all day but recovered to the plus side in the final hour.    Bucking the generally negative technology trend was Lotus Development, which added 3/4 to 18 3/4 after having risen 1 on Monday. The personal-computer software maker, whose shares were trading as high as 33 in March and 20 last month, this week said it will repurchase as much as 15% of its stock outstanding, or 6.7 million shares.    Among other active stocks, McCormick andamp; Co. soared 1 3/4 to 27 1/4 in active trading. The Hunt Valley, Md., spice and flavorings maker said Monday it will sell its real estate unit for $550 million and use part of the money to repurchase McCormick shares. One of the two buyers of the unit was Rouse Co., a giant developer; its stock rose 1 to 22 1/4.    MCI Communications gained 1/8 to 19 on a Nasdaq-leading 2.5 million shares.    Nasdaq volume was 99.1 million shares, up 20% from the slowest session of the year on Monday. But volume remains on a pace that would make September the market's slowest month in nearly two years. </TEXT></DOC>
