Subcutaneous single injection of syngeneic serumimmunoglobulins in a dose of 10 mg protein per mouse (500 mg/kg) helpedpreserve the number of mononuclears with FcR at a level higher than inintact animals, showing a significant increase on days 1, 5, 10 and 25.This phenomenon was more pronounced after the administration of immunoglobulinswith normal antibodies to tissues obtained by precipitation with ammoniumsulfate from the serum of hemostimulated mice.
