Within that, the cost ofMedicare program is nearing $80 billion annually, with general tax revenuesand public trust funds making up the larger part of the total. Thus,the Reagan administration and congressional leaders have sought for severalyears to restrain further increases in Medicare costs. One proposal,offered with the 1988 budget message, would be to pay radiologists, anesthesiologists,and pathologists for services to hospitalized Medicare beneficiariesthrough a diagnosis related group mechanism, comparable to the currentbasis for paying hospital costs. Along with most other national medicalgroups, the American College of Radiology has made an extraordinary effortto defeat this proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
