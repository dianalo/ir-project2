Constitution:The fuel assembly has a plurality of detacheable flow rate control mechanismabove a handling head and each of the flow rate control mechanisms comprisesa cylindrical body and an orifice disposed therein. One or more of aplurality of flow rate control mechanisms is connected to the upper portionof the handling head to control the coolant flow rate. In this way, itis possible to prevent abnormal rise of fuel can temperature correspondingto the power change and flatten the temperature flactuation, by whichexcess coolant consumption is eliminated to improve the heat efficiency,and stable operation condition can be attained.
