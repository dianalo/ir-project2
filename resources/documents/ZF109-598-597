 In the same manner, as the Mac fillscorporate desktops, the need to read and understand files created by otherapplications -- be they Macintosh, DOS or other types -- also increases.andM;Until recently, the domain of Mac file translation has belonged almostexclusively to DataViz Inc. and its $169 MacLinkPlus/Translators 4.52.andP;  Thismarket prominence was challenged earlier this year by two heavyweights fromthe DOS world: Mastersoft Inc., with the $149 Word for Word Macintosh (alsodistributed by The Software Toolworks Inc.), and Systems Compatibility Corp.,andO;with its $129 Software Bridge Macintosh.andM;DataViz has continually upgraded and improved MacLinkPlus/Translators,providing conversions for a wide variety of word processors (including themajor players in the Macintosh, DOS and workstation environments) as well assome graphics, database and spreadsheet formats.andP;  The two new entrants,however, have focused on word processing document conversion.andM;(Many users, especially Mac Portable owners, are content using thetranslators in LapLink Mac III from Traveling Software Inc. of Bothell,Wash., which we reviewed April 7.andP;  While it excels in flexible and speedyfile transfers, it is somewhat deficient in Mac-to-MS-DOS file translations.andO;WordPerfect for DOS, MultiMate, Word, WordStar, XyWrite II and III, and Qandamp;AWrite formats can be translated only into MacWrite versions 4.5 or 5.0formats and vice versa.)andM;The Word 4.0 factor.andP;  The primary issue in translating word processing filesbetween different applications is the retention of as much formattinginformation as possible.andP;  For converting relatively simple documents betweenMacintosh programs, all three utilities perform admirably.andP;  When convertingdocuments from DOS to the Mac or when converting an extremely complexdocument from one Macintosh format to another, the deficiencies of theutilities become apparent.andM;To investigate Mac-to-Mac conversions, we tested a simple Word document inFast Save format and five complex sample documents provided by MicrosoftCorp. with Word 4.0.andP;  Only Software Bridge Macintosh was unable to convertthe Fast Save-format document.andP;  Since the Fast Save option is the default andmore than 50 percent of existing Mac word processing documents are created byWord, it's difficult to overestimate the importance of reading this format.andM;Our experience with the complex Word sample documents was less rewarding.andO;None of the three products could successfully deal with elements such askerning, multiple columns, automatic numbering and embedded PostScriptcommands.andP;  Results for MacLinkPlus/Translators and Software Bridge Macintoshwere closer to the original documents than those of Word for Word Macintosh,but all were unacceptable.andP;  In particular, one sample Word document -- afour-page application for employment -- proved to be too much for Word forWord Macintosh, which went into an endless loop after processing about 35percent of the document.andM;Fully translating documents from the DOS environment is decidedly morecomplex than translating from one Mac format to another, particularly if thesource document contains headers and footers.andP;  Software Bridge Macintoshleads in accomplishing this task, although DataViz has incorporated supportfor translating graphics, tables, headers, footers and footnotes fromWordPerfect 5.1 to Word 4.0 format in the latest version ofMacLinkPlus/Translators and promises similar support for other wordprocessing file formats in future versions.andM;Three faces of translators.andP;  The format-conversion capabilities ofMacLinkPlus/Translators may be used within Apple File Exchange, as astand-alone application or integrated into applications that use ClarisCorp.'s XTND technology.andP;  Software Bridge Macintosh's translators also areaccessed via Apple File Exchange, ensuring a standard Mac interface.andP;  OnlyWord for Word Macintosh does not support Apple File Exchange.andP;  Its interface,while adequate, is not quite up to the Mac standard, lacking basic featuressuch as Shift-click selecting.andM;We believe support for Apple File Exchange is particularly important.andP;  Inaddition to a simple interface, Apple's utility provides direct access to3.5-inch DOS disks for users whose Macs are equipped with SuperDrives orother DOS-compatible drives.andP;  All three products support translation of filesaccessed via networks or transferred through serial cable or modems.andM;For modem transfers, Word for Word Macintosh includes a special format calledCOM.andP;  Once a file has been translated into the COM format, it can betransmitted via modem to another machine without special protocols.andP;  The userwho receives the file then translates it into any of the formats supported byWord for Word Macintosh.andP;  The company claims that the COM format retains allthe formatting information of the original document.andM;The deciding feature.andP;  Each utility supports a variety of file formats (seetable, Page 58).andP;  One feature, however, may be the distinguishing factor forsome users.andP;  For example, in addition to reading Word files in Fast Saveformat, Word for Word Macintosh translates WriteNow files, and it alone canread FullWrite Professional files.andP;  (This is a one-way affair; it cannotwrite in FullWrite format.)andM;By supporting XTND, MacWrite II 1.1 can use MacLinkPlus/Translators directlyin its Open, Save As and Insert File dialogs, providing MacWrite II userswith unparalleled file-translation transparency.andP;  MacLinkPlus/Translators isthe only product of the three that can recognize the Microsoft Works wordprocessing file format.andP;  Additionally, MacLinkPlus/Translators includestranslators for most popular graphics, database and spreadsheet file formatsfor the Mac and IBM PCs and compatibles, in addition to several ratheresoteric formats such as WriteNow for NeXT machines.andM;Other distinguishing features are initially much more subtle.andP;  Consider, forexample, translating DCA/RFT files containing centered text.andP;  The DCA/RFTstandard is to use tabs for centering.andP;  MacLinkPlus/Translators retains thesetabs when converting to most other formats, usually with unacceptableresults, while Software Bridge Macintosh is intelligent enough to trulycenter the text.andM;The manuals for both Word for Word Macintosh and Software Bridge Macintoshare noticeably thin and don't have a great deal of information, particularlyon exceptions to supported translations.andP;  The MacLinkPlus/Translatorsdocumentation is better.andM;Conclusions.andP;  For relatively simple documents, translating files betweenapplications and across platforms with any of these three products verges onthe magical.andP;  As the complexity grows with the inclusion of columns, numberedparagraphs, section breaks and so on, the magic begins to wane, and onebegins to see the wisdom of using word processors to process words andpage-layout applications to create complex documents.andP;  But in most cases,using one of these three translators is superior to any alternative.andM;When choosing among them, check the chart on Page 58 to discover whichutilities can translate the documents you've got.andP;  If possible, we recommendthat you try the candidates on real documents, especially if you createcomplex ones.andM;After that, consider whether being able to read DOS disks is necessary; if itis, cross Mastersoft's Word for Word Macintosh off your list or considerbuying a utility for reading DOS disks, such as Insignia Solutions Inc.'sAccessPC or Dayna Communications Inc.'s DOS Mounter.andM;Likewise, if you use Microsoft Word in its default Fast Save mode, then avoidSystems Compatibility Corp.'s Software Bridge Macintosh, since it can'thandle those files.andM;If your word processing formats are supported, and you also need to handleother files, such as graphics and spreadsheets, MacLinkPlus/Translatorsshould be your choice.andM;File translatorsandM;There are now several options in file translation for word processingdocuments.andP;  The contenders come close to one another in most areas, but a fewfeatures separate them.andM;andgt;MacLinkPlus/Translators 4.52 from DataViz Inc. doesn't support as many DOSword processing file formats as its competitors, but this granddaddy of Mactranslation is alone in supporting WriteNow and Works.andP;  Its compatibilitywith Claris' XTND makes it a natural choice for MacWrite II users, andsupport for various graphic, spreadsheet and database formats is an addedbonus.andP;  The best new feature is support for Word files in Fast Save format.andM;andgt;Software Bridge Macintosh from Systems Compatibility Corp. is a new entrantin the Mac field from an established DOS player.andP;  It sports the three mostpopular Mac formats as well as a large number of DOS formats.andP;  It's strongestin the field of reliable DOS-to-Mac conversions of complex documents.andP;  Theinterface is courtesy of Apple File Exchange.andP;  The lack of support for Wordfiles in Fast Save format is a big disappointment.andM;andgt;Word for Word Macintosh from Mastersoft Inc. reflects the company'sexperience in the DOS market and supports the widest range of DOS formats.andO;It alone can read FullWrite Pro files.andP;  On the down side, the user interfaceis somewhat non-standard, and this was the only utility that froze during ourtorture tests.andP;  Word for Word can read Word files in Fast Save format.andM;DATAVIZ INC.andM;MacLinkPlus/Translators 4.52: $169andM;35 Corporate Drive, Trumbull, Conn.andP;
