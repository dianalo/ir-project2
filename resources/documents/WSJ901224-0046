The recommendation follows Japan's pledge during theStructural Impediments Initiative trade talks with the U.S.earlier this year to strengthen the country's weakanti-monopoly regulations.</LP><TEXT>   The proposed 6% level would still leave Japan'santi-monopoly surcharges below those typically charged in theU.S. and the European Community. The U.S. also wants Japan tostrengthen criminal enforcement against illegal cartels andto make it easier for private parties to bring civil suitsagainst companies engaged in cartels.</TEXT></DOC>
