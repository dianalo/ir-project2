Both mutants have parental CHO characteristics asdetermined by G-banded karyotypes, chromosome counts, and populationdoubling times. Both clones have been in culture for over 7 months andhave maintained their original phenotypes regarding heat sensitivityat 41.5{sup 0}C, 42.0{sup 0}C and 45.0{sup 0}C; development and decayof thermotolerance; and unique morphological properties. Thermotoleranceratios (TTR), defined as the ratio of D/sub O/'s for fractionated andsingle dose heating, were calculated for each clone at various timesafter receiving an initial heat dose which reduced the surviving fractionto /sup --/10/sup -1/. Twelve hr of incubation at 37{sup 0}C followingthe initial heat dose resulted in TTR values of 5.25 for the parentalCHO cells and 17.5 for the HSTE-23 mutant, while the HSTD-36 value wascalculated as 1.5. Clonal differences in the kinetics of the developmentand decay of thermotolerance were measured at a variety of isodose survivallevels.</TEXT></DOC>
