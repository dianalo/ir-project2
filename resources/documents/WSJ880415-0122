That's not likely to happen.    The legislative outlook for this year and beyond is that federal tax laws will be altered again. And while Congress may not do much more than tinker with taxes this year, it will probably enact a large tax increase in 1989.    &quot;In taxes, the rest of this year will be fairly calm,&quot; says Charls Walker, a top Washington tax lobbyist and former Treasury Department official. &quot;But 1989 could be the biggest tax year in the history of the republic.&quot;    The reason is timing: It's easiest for a new president to take tough action right after the election, and next year he's sure to be pressured into trying to reduce the huge federal budget deficit. Lawmakers say it can only be done by raising taxes substantially and by making large domestic spending cuts. Chances are the National Economic Commission will say the same thing when it issues its specific deficit-reduction recommendations, due by next March 1.    Already, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski has his staff at work preparing tax-hike options, including changes in taxes on foreign-investment income, the corporate minimum tax and personal deductions. &quot;I think we will have to face reality and raise revenue to cut the deficit next year,&quot; the Illinois Democrat said recently.    Even so, both he and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) are planning to push for legislation to make technical corrections to the 1986 and 1987 tax laws. And, despite Mr. Rostenkowski's vows to raise revenue in the future, he and Mr. Bentsen may try to tack on a proviso to extend some popular tax breaks that are expiring this year.    President Reagan no doubt would support their efforts. His budget calls for $1.5 billion in tax breaks for the coming fiscal year -- and is based largely on just those extensions.    One popular break due to expire at year's end is the research and development credit for corporations. Right now a move is on to get Congress either to extend the 20% tax credit or to make it permanent. Similarly, many legislators want to revive an Randamp;D provision that was phased out last summer. This one affects multinationals only and allows them to apportion Randamp;D expenses between foreign and domestic operations in a way that increases the companies' U.S. foreign tax credit.    Moreover, the White House and its supporters in Congress also want to eliminate a rule that requires mutual-fund investors to pay taxes on certain expenses incurred by the funds. Other possible breaks include restoring the exclusions from taxable income for educational assistance plans and for group legal services.    Congressional backing for measures such as these often depends on finding politically viable ways of raising revenue to pay for them. Among some of the options are: speeding up payment schedules for corporate estimated taxes, taking away tax benefits for certain investmentlike single-premium life insurance policies -- and increasing the corporate minimum tax.    Congress already is considering a benefit package designed to do away with diesel fuel taxes for some users of the fuel. It also would give taxpayers greater protection in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service, which could cost the federal government millions in uncollected taxes. One reason the package has found favor is that it contains its own built-in revenue-raising measure: As passed by the Senate Finance Committee, it calls for doubling the &quot;gas guzzler&quot; tax on luxury cars that fail to meet federal fuel-efficiency standards.    Still, such offsetting measures don't raise the kind of additional revenue needed to actually reduce the federal budget deficit. By next year policy makers expect to be under tremendous pressure to do just that. But what action Congress ultimately takes, says Sen. Bentsen, mostly &quot;depends on who the next president is.&quot; Vice President George Bush says he favors a cut in the capital-gains rate -- a move he believes would stimulate capital investment and, as a result, raise revenue. Among the Democrats, Michael Dukakis wants to raise money by increased tax compliance; Albert Gore Jr. proposes a &quot;luxury&quot; tax on purchases of expensive items like jewelry and fur coats and increases in corporate and inheritance taxes; and Jesse Jackson wants higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, an oil import fee and luxury taxes.    Naturally, presidential candidates are loath to predict broad income-tax increases -- just look what happened to Walter Mondale during the last election. But like it or not, many policy makers indeed expect to be part of a tax increase. &quot;In the next two or three years,&quot; predicts David Brockway, former staff director of the Joint Tax Committee, &quot;Congress will raise income taxes directly by retaining a high rate for high-income individuals, or indirectly by a surcharge on income.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;New Rules Effective This Year May Alter Taxpayers' Strategies&quot; -- WSJ April 15, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
