Gorbachev is not withdrawing military support fromNicaragua, is accusing the Soviet president of empty rhetoricregarding Central American peace.   ``While his words about not exporting revolution are welcomed,they are not matched by deeds which would give those wordscredence,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater saidWednesday, referring to Gorbachev's denunciation of the export ofrevolution.   Gorbachev's comments in his speech in Havana on Tuesdayconflicted with the policy of Cuban President Fidel Castro, whosupports the spread of revolutionary movements.   But, in a written statement read by Fitzwater, the White Housecalled on Gorbachev to back up his statements about wantingdemilitarized peace zones in Central America, by discontinuingmilitary assistance to the leftist government of Nicaragua.   ``Today, we call upon the Soviets to cut off theirhalf-billion-dollar annual military aid to Nicaragua. The Sovietscontinue to pour arms into Nicaragua, a country whose army isalready larger than those of all their neighbors combined,'' hesaid.   Fitzwater said continued Soviet activity in Central America willaffect U.S.-Soviet relations, but declined to specify how theadministration might express its displesure.   ``We've never made linkage threats,'' he said. ``But we havealways said these are the kinds of things that influence therelationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.''   A day earlier, Fitzwater had said Soviet spokesman GennadyGerasimov's statements against the export of revolution appeared tobe a positive sign. But on Wednesday he was more resng, ``We can hold outa little optimism on the basis of thewords,'' but that the administration is looking for deedsto backthem up.   U.S. officials looked to the Soviet leader's visit to Cuba as anopportunity for him to change direction in Central America. Bushhad written him urging Soviet withdrawal of military support fromthe leftist Nicaraguan government, and a halt to Cuban andNicaraguan support for leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.   But Gorbachev, in his Tuesday speech to the National Assembly inHavana, said Moscow will not has support for Nicaragua as long United Statescontinues military assistance to othergovernments in the region.   Fitzwatertcomparable to the Soviet assistance because the U.S.-backed nations``are not involved in subversion of their neighbors.''   U.S. officials estimate the Soviets shipped more than $500million in military aid last year to Nicaragua and gave Managua thesame amount in economic asse the United States hasbankrolled the Contra rebels fighting to oust the Sandinistas.Bush's shift to a diplomatic course means U.S. aid to the Contrasis now non-military.   U.S. aid to El Salvador this decade totals some $3.5 billion,and the administration accuses the Soviets of supporting theSalvadoran rebels through Cuba and Nicaragua. Critics of theadministration policy, meanwhile, cite widespreder the U.S.-backed regime.</TEXT></DOC>
