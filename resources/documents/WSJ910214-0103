Macy andamp; Co. showed significant improvementin its operating cash flow during its second quarter endedFeb. 2, but sales fell sharply during the Christmas season.   Official results won't be reported until mid-March, but ina letter to shareholders the company said second-quarterearnings before interest, taxes and depreciation increased21% to about $254 million from $210 million in the year-agoquarter.</LP><TEXT>   Macy achieved those gains despite a 9.4% decrease in salesfor the quarter, or about $2.21 billion in revenue comparedwith $2.44 billion in the second quarter of 1990. Some of thefalloff in revenue reflected Macy's decision to reduce itsChristmas inventory by more than $500 million compared withlast year.   For the first six months of Macy's fiscal year, earningsbefore interest, taxes and depreciation were $407 million,down 2.5% from $417 million during the same period a yearearlier. A Macy spokesman noted that the retailer's poorfirst-quarter performance severely affected its six-monthfigures.   &quot;Macy's operating cash flow was better than manyexpected,&quot; said Joseph Amato, an analyst with Kidder, Peabodyandamp; Co. &quot;This was the worst Christmas in ten years, and inlight of that, people are going to be pretty happy with thecompany's performance.&quot;   Looking ahead, Mr. Amato suggested that the spring sellingseason will be weak for Macy as well as other retailers.However, he noted that Macy will have less spring merchandisethan it did a year ago, which may improve profit margins.   Credit analysts generally reacted favorably to the Macydisclosures. Richard Posner, an executive vice president withCredit Exchange Inc., a supplier of credit information to theapparel industry, said: &quot;In the sense of meeting theirprojections, Macy is on plan. But their performance was alsodisappointing because revenue dropped, much the way revenuedropped for other stores. Overall, Macy continues to do a lotof things right, and we're recommending shipments of newgoods.&quot;   Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller Inc., a men's andwomen's apparel manufacturer, said he expects to see fewerpromotions this year at Macy, a development he said willboost the retailer's profits.   &quot;If endless promotions were great, Gimbels would still bein business,&quot; he said. &quot;Retailers aren't in the needbusiness, they are in the want business. Putting stuff onsale every day doesn't make people want it.&quot;   Macy also disclosed that negotiations to sell thecompany's credit operations to General Electric Co. are&quot;taking somewhat longer&quot; than anticipated. Macy noted it willmeet all its bank covenants for the quarter.</TEXT></DOC>
