The company, a unit of Newark, N.J.-based Prudential Insurance Co. of America, is the first U.S.-owned firm to cease operating as a primary dealer in British government securities. It said it will continue to trade gilts through its Clive Discount subsidiary and also will act in an agency role in gilts.    A Prudential-Bache official said about 24 people were employed in the gilts unit; about six are likely to be offered other positions in the company.    &quot;Prospects for a sufficient increase in revenue to show a satisfactory return on capital aren't considered good enough to justify continuing as a market maker,&quot; the company said in a statement. &quot;Trading income hasn't covered operating costs in the year ended Dec. 31, 1987, in spite of an increase in market share over that period.&quot;    Prudential-Bache is the fourth company to withdraw from gilt-edged market making since October 1986, when 27 companies were established as gilt market makers under license from the Bank of England. </TEXT></DOC>
