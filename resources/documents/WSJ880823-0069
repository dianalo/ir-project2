Think again. Thanks to the Gang That Can't Shoot Straight -- Congress -- the 1970 RICO statute has instead become the scourge of corporate directors, accountants and others whose only link to a racket is the tennis court.    The idea behind RICO was to get the leaders of huge criminal conspiracies. Congress could have simply made it a crime to belong to groups such as the Mafia. But civil libertarians objected that next could come the reintroduction of other so-called status crimes such as vagrancy and loitering. Instead, Congress passed a vague statute that regularly confounds juries covering anyone involved in a &quot;racketeering enterprise&quot; who commits two &quot;predicate acts&quot; within 10 years. Anyone criminally indicted can have his assets frozen and, even without criminal convictions, victorious private plaintiffs get triple damages. This led plaintiffs who sued the Hunt brothers for cornering the silver market to throw RICO into the pot. Last week, the jury found all the defendants liable, but rather bewilderingly found two brothers were &quot;racketeers&quot; while one was not.    It took about a decade after RICO was passed for plaintiff lawyers to realize it was a pot of gold. The key is that the predicate acts include the vague crimes of &quot;wire fraud&quot; and &quot;mail fraud.&quot; It was off to the races because almost any action involves phones or mail and can be alleged fraud. Armed with the tip sheets Racketeer Litigation Reporter and RICO Law Reporter, plaintiff lawyers started suing everyone in sight as a racketeer, from spouses in divorces to accountants in bankruptcies.    Now an astonishing more than 90% of all RICO cases are for damages against white-collar defendants. The threat of being branded a racketeer and of triple damages results in many out-of-court settlements of bogus suits. Billions of dollars have been coerced this way, making this legal abuse a huge drag on the efficient economy. It's so bad that even such sleepy groups as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the National Association of Manufacturers have lobbied for RICO reform.    At first, they tried to limit the predicate acts to murder, extortion and other common trade practices of organized crime. This was stonewalled by &quot;Senator No&quot; -- Howard Metzenbaum -- who apparently believes bookkeeping and stock trading are racketeering enterprises. The AFL-CIO and even the ACLU support eliminating triple damages where federal or state securities laws already apply, but Congress hasn't acted.    The Reagan administration has urged reform of civil RICO, but ironically its own prosecutors have introduced new abuses of RICO on the criminal side. Manhattan federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani has made RICO the modern rubber hose.    Mr. Giuliani used RICO to indict E. Robert Wallach in December 1987, for his work for Wedtech. His two predicate acts were mailing letters of thanks for payment of legal fees. The prosecutors say this was a &quot;fraud&quot; because it was allegedly payment for lobbying. The government froze Mr. Wallach's property and he's hardly worked since. As the magazine American Lawyer suggested, the real purpose seems to be to pressure Mr. Wallach to finger his friend Edwin Meese for something. But now that an independent counsel has cleared Mr. Meese, why ruin Mr. Wallach?    Mr. Giuliani also recently used RICO to indict five officials of Princeton/Newport Partners and one former official at Drexel Burnham. Time will tell the merits of the market-manipulation and tax-evasion charges, but RICO is clearly out of place here. Indeed, these are the first securities officials ever indicted for RICO.    Defense lawyers charge this is another rubber-hose case. They say it's really all about two other great embarrassments of Mr. Giuliani's career: the inside-trading indictments he had to drop after humiliating investment bankers Robert Freeman, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor and the three-year-old accusations led by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Drexel's Michael Milken that have resulted in no court charges.    Princeton/Newport did business with both Mr. Freeman of Goldman, Sachs and Mr. Milken. Defense lawyers say Mr. Giuliani told their clients that they'd get off if they incriminated the pair for something. Instead, the traders' lawyers said, &quot;PNP is proud of its association with those firms, has no evidence of any wrongdoing on their part, and refuses to join in this broad attack on Wall Street.&quot;    New Attorney General Richard Thornburgh should put RICO reform at the top of his five-month agenda. He should order Mr. Giuliani to cool it. He should also urge Congress to reform the law so that once again only organized crime has to worry about RICO's enormous consequences. </TEXT></DOC>
