Edison's problems come just as it's trying to negotiate itsfirst new franchise with Chicago in 42 years.   The contract expires Dec. 31, but the city this month haltednegotiations, saying it wanted to extend the current deal anotheryear while it figures out whether Edison is dependable.   ``We can't bargain in the dark,'' Mayor Richard M. Daley saidrecently.   Edison hasn't said yet whether it will agree to the extension.Utility spokesman John Hogan said Comm Ed would like to see thedeal completed this year and that, in any case, its reliability isunimpeachable.   Even if eependability weren't an issue, the city holds a wildcard: the option under the current franchise of buying Comm Ed'sfacilities in the city.   Other major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, have publicutilities, and some smaller cities have recently used franchisebuyout clauses to purchase private utilities, said Deborah Nuttall,a spokeswoman for the Washington, D.C.-based American Public PowerAssociation.   But no large cities have made such a buyout in recent years, shesaid.   Edison is trying to salvage its image after a series ofcrippling blackouts, including one in late July in which 40,000West Side customers were without electricity for three days. Somesmall stores were looted during the outage.   About a week later, an outage cut off 25,000 customers,infuriating many people.   Four less severe power failures have hit the city and suburbs inthe past three days, including two Monday that briefly knocked outpower to more than 2,000 customers.   On Saturday, 15,000 West Side customers were without power forup to seven hours, and on Sunday a brief blackout hit about 2,500South Side customers.   Other unrelated failures cut off power to the downtown area ofthe city of Streeterville and the Chicago Board of Trade, wheretrading was suspended for about an hour last Tuesday.   Hogan said that because of the two major summer blackouts, themedia is reporting minor problems that previously would have beenignored.   Edison has blamed the West Side blackouts on a problem at agenerating plant, and other failures on damaged cables and animalschewing power lines.   Still, Hogan said Edison maintains ``a 99.98 percent reliabilityfactor.''   ``We don't have any reason to believe the total infrastructureis in jeopardy,'' Hogan said.   Even so, the Daley administration insists a buyout is a realalternative.   ``This is not a bargaining chip,'' Daley spokeswoman CarolynGrisko said Friday. ``This is a possibility.''   The current agreement gives the city the right to purchase CommEd's system within the city's limits - an option first givenserious consideration in 1985 under the late Mayor HaroldWashington's administration.   The utility serves 3.2 million customers in 25 counties ofnorthern Illinois.   Other issues besides the buyout are on the table, including howmuch money the utility pays the city for the right to operate here.Currently, the utility pays Chicago 4 percent of its gross receipts- which last year was in excess of $72 million, Hogan said.   Consumer groups, such as Citizens Utility Board, are asking thecity to consider a new franchise that would require CommonwealthEdison to work harder to cut customer costs.   Residential Commonwealth Edison customers paid 10.7 cents perkilowatt hour for electricity in 1988, compared with a nationalaverage of 7.5 cents, according to the power association.   Edison financial analysts say the utility also has a lot to losein the talks.   Chicago represents ``a large portion of the company's sales,''said Linda Byus, a utility analyst for Duff andamp; Phelps in Chicago.Its image also is linked closely to the city, which may help forgean amicable agreement between the two, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
