The commission voted 4-1 to propose the rules, which are subject to two to three months of public comment. The agency hopes to adopt final rules by year-end.    The most debate is likely to be generated by two of the three proposals. One would spell out a voluntary competitive-bidding system for filling a utility's power needs. The other would encourage new competitors to get into the electricity-selling business as independent power producers.    The changes, although voluntary state to state, could eventually transform the electricity industry and result in most power plants being built by new power producers instead of by utilities bound by strict state regulation. The commission's hope is that more competition will mean lower prices for consumers.    Four states already have adopted competitive-bidding systems as an alternative to administratively setting wholesale prices for power generated by small, non-utility producers born under the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act. The law encourages non-utilities to generate power from industrial steam, called cogeneration, and renewable resources such as wind, sunlight and water.    The commission's proposal, while soliciting ideas, sets out minimal conditions that would have to be met by any competitive bidding system set up by state regulators. Commission lawyers said they didn't think the rules would significantly change existing bidding systems.    The proposal on independent power producers would streamline the rules and paperwork for companies that want to get into the business of building plants and selling the power to utilities, for re-sale to consumers. This new breed of producers wouldn't be subject to the same stiff regulations and limited rates-of-return as utilities.    The electricity industry is split over the proposals. Some companies, such as Virginia Power, aren't interested in building expensive new power plants under traditional state regulation anymore and want more flexibility in purchasing power. Other utilities don't want to change.    Utilities also will be debating whether the proposals will allow them to compete on a level playing field with outside competitors to fill their own power needs. A utility trade group, Edison Electric Institute, insists utilities should be able to build plants -- with the same freedoms enjoyed by new independent power producers -- within their own service territories. The proposed rules wouldn't allow it.    Less controversial is the third proposal, which gives states guidance on how to set prices for cogenerated and renewable power that utilities must buy under the 1978 law. The law says utilities under certain circumstances must buy the power at a rate that approximates what it would have cost the utility to build or obtain it elsewhere. Many utilities and small power producers have complained that the rates currently are set too high in some states and too low in others.    Prompted by complaints from state regulators, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dropped plans to propose setting a common rate for power purchased by multistate utilities, which operate over state lines. Instead, the commission simply asked for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
