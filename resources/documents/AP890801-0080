DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Department of Energy should slow its plansfor a proposed high-level nuclear waste dump in Nevada and makestudying the risk of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions a highpriority, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff said today.   The NRC staff made public its comments on the department's sitecharacterization plan designed to determine whether the proposedYucca Mountain repository, located about 100 miles northwest of LasVegas, could safely store tons of radioactive nuclear waste for10,000 years.   ``NRC has a broad programmatic concern that the pressure to meetunrealistic schedule milestones may leave DOE insufficient time toplan and to execute proper technical information-gatheringactivities,'' said Robert Bernero, chief of waste disposal for thecommission.   In a letter to Sam Rousso, acting director of civilianradioactive waste management for the energy department, Berneroalso expressed concern about geologic faults and volcanic cones inthe area.   ``High priority should be given to conducting thoseinvestigations which can lead to a determination of whether thesite is subject to an unacceptably high probability of disruptionas a result of volcanism, faulting, or seismicity,'' Bernero said.   At a briefing at NRC headquarters in nearby Rockville, Md.,Bernero said the volcanic cones in the area of Yucca Mountain havebeen a cause of concern for NRC experts.   ``You can't miss them,'' he said. ``If you stand on themountain, that's what you see.''   Bernero also said in his letter that the department ``needs todemonstrate the adequacy'' of its design for an experimental shaftto be drilled on the proposed site, which he said would probably beused for ventilation and other purposes.   The department also needed to improve its program to assurequality of performance by contractors, he said.   The Nevada state government is strongly opposed to the wastedump for safety and public health reasons. Gov. Bob Miller recentlysigned a bill prohibiting storage of high-level radioactive wastein Nevada.</TEXT></DOC>
