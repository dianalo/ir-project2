Critics contend that if trade-by-calendar was thatsure-fire, so many traders would play that the profitabilitywould disappear. Nonetheless, some seasonal trades appear toturn a profit four out of every five years, and a few dobetter than that.</LP><TEXT>   Consider, for example, a trade in December heating oilthat involves buying the contract on Sept. 13 and selling iton Oct. 17. This year for the tenth year out of the past 12the trade produced a profit, and a big one, too: more than$2,700 a contract, almost 70% more than the 12-year averageprofit of $1,600.   While many seasonal trades appear to work because ofharvest or weather conditions -- for example, heating oilcontracts rally before cold weather arrives as dealers stockup on supplies -- in many cases the forces producing seasonalmoves aren't readily apparent.   Moore Research Center, an independent futures researchfirm, seeks out potentially profitable seasonal trades. Eachmonth Moore Research's computers sort through their databases-- which stretch back 30 years for some commodities -- anddiscover tens of thousands of possible trades. They discardthe ones that have failed to be profitable 80% of the time orhave less than a six-year history.   Steven Moore, director, points out that his firm doesn'trecommend trades but simply publishes pertinent history thattraders may use to investigate further.   &quot;We suggest that traders either utilize some othertechnical method of trading to confirm the trade's history,or examine the year-by-year price patterns of the trade tosee if this year's prices are shaping up like those ofearlier years that turned out profitable,&quot; Mr. Moore says.&quot;Time, effort and expertise are vital to this approach, forthere is no magic formula to decipher market direction.&quot;   Because many of these seasonal patterns are well-known,some traders initiate the strategies a few days early to beatthe rush. Mr. Moore suggests that serious seasonal tradersshould be studying the price action of the contracts they areinterested in and be prepared to act as early as seven daysbefore the entry date he publishes.   Because no one knows if a particular seasonal trade willwork this year, Mr. Moore recommends that traders use severalto improve their odds of success. He notes that nearly all ofthe usually reliable grain trades failed this past summerbecause the markets appeared to anticipate bad weather thatdidn't materialize.   Moore Research suggests how much should be risked on eachcontract based on its study of volatility. Mr. Moore alsourges traders to protect themselves with stop orders -- whichtell the broker to take the investor out of a trade at apredetermined price -- either to limit losses or preserveprofits. Even if a trade has been successful each of the pastnine years, &quot;This could be the year it doesn't work,&quot; hepoints out.   Seasonal spread trades also are on Moore Research's menu.In a spread trade, the trader buys one contract andsimultaneously sells another of the same or a relatedcommodity with the hope that the price difference between thetwo will widen or narrow in a way that produces a profit.Spread trades are popular with many traders because theyusually require less initial capital, based on their tendencyto be less volatile than straightforward buying or selling.   Moore Research Center's current report includes data onthe maximum profits and biggest losses produced by variousseasonal trades in recent years.

Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Weather may have a further impact on oil markets this weekafter helping petroleum futures to end last week on a firmnote in New York and London. In the wake of a severe coldwave which brought a huge snowfall and subzero temperaturesto the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions of the U.S., crudeoil for December delivery settled 45 cents higher at $23.82 abarrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   Similarly, on London's International Petroleum Exchange,the December Brent blend contract was up 41 cents Friday toclose the week at $22.51 a barrel. According to the Dow JonesInternational Petroleum Report, market participants creditedthe jump in London futures prices to a number of factorsincluding fears of a cold winter in the U.S., which wouldboost demand for fuels.   Also still affecting oil markets is the assumption offurther declines in supplies from the Soviet Union. But theauthoritative Petroleum Intelligence Weekly questions thisassumption. &quot;Markets could be in for a supply shock theyhaven't been expecting: higher oil exports from the SovietUnion,&quot; PIW will report today. Over the next six months, theindustry publication suggests, Soviet exports &quot;should be nomore than 200,000 barrels a day below last winter's 2.3million barrels a day levels and could be as much as 600,000barrels a day above.&quot;                                                                                                          Livestock andamp; Meat                                                                                                          Analysts say another week of sluggish trading is likely.   The cattle market is having problems digesting a temporaryglut of unusually heavy livestock at a time when retaildemand is waning. A winter storm in the Midwest late lastweek exacerbated the situation by preventing farmers andfeedlots from delivering their fattened cattle to meatpackers-- giving the cattle even more time to add extra pounds.   Poor demand for beef from retailers helped prompt severalmeatpackers to reduce their operating hours last week.   Hog prices, meanwhile, are depressed by signs that farmersare rapidly expanding their herds.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          The weather watch in Brazil continues.   Rain last week provided some relief to the dry conditionsplaguing the coffeegrowing areas of Brazil and is expected tocontinue this week, said James Steel, analyst at Refco in NewYork.   On Friday, prices fell on word that Colombia had cut theprice paid to farmers by two cents, he said. That news pushedcoffee futures in New York below 80 cents, where standingsell orders were triggered and prices fell further, he said.   After setting a new life-of-contract low of 77.95 cents apound, coffee for December delivery ended at 78.8 cents, down1.75 cents on Friday.   Producer selling and very little buying by roasters couldalso weigh on prices, he added. Given all the bearish factorsin the market, Mr. Steel said, prices could fall to 75 centsthis week.</TEXT></DOC>
