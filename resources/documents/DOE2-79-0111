We have studiedthe usefulness of dynamic CT scans particularly for diagnosis of smallmicroadenomas. The dynamic CT scans were performed for 61 normal pituitaryglands and 68 pituitary adenomas (36 microadenomas, 32 macroadenomas)with a GECT/T 9800 scanner. Coronal sections of 1.5 mm thickness weretaken at the plane just in front of the pituitary stalk of the pituitarygland. Following a bolus intra-venous injection of 40 - 60 ml of contrastmedia using an automatic injector, ten consecutive CT scans of 2 secondsscan time were obtained, beginning 2 seconds from the start of intravenousinjection. The first seven scans were taken with an interval of 2.3 seconds,and the last three scans with an interval of 10 seconds. Then, time-densitycurves were obtained at the ROI which were set on the anterior pituitarygland, the vascular bed of the pituitary gland, the pituitary stalk andthe area of the pituitary adenoma respectively. In a normal pituitarygland, the density increases gradually and makes an S shaped curve, thenattains the maximum density value (92.3 CT number) approximately 60 secondsafter the administration of contrast media. The pituitary vascular bedis located in midline on the upper surface of the pituitary gland, andshows a symmetrical square, triangular or rhomboid shape. In case ofpituitary adenoma, the time-density curve makes a plateau curve and attainsthe maximum density value (60.1 CT number) approximately 60 seconds afterthe administration of contrast media. In microadenoma, the pituitaryvascular bed is either deformed or compressed, showing an asymmetricalshape.</TEXT></DOC>
