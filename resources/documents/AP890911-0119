They were among the thousands of East Germans who arrived in WestGermany in an exodus that has drawn the wrath of the Communistleadership in East Berlin.   The twins said they had obtained vacation visas for Hungary, butthey were still at a border crossing in Czechoslovakia on Sundaywhen they heard Hungary opened its borders to the West.   ``We had visas for Hungary, so we went there and from Hungary wedrove straight here,'' Volkmar said of the trip that took themthrough Austria and into West Germany's Bavaria state.   ``We did not really plan to come here,'' Volkmar said. ``But whenwe heard about the opening of the border, we decided this was achance.''   The twins said they had left relatives behind in East Germany.   ``We have left our parents and a sister in Leipzig. I think ourmother realized that we may decide to cross. We have talked about ita little bit, but I don't know what my father will say,'' Katrinsaid.   ``We have lost all hope of reforms in East Germany,'' she added.   Katrin said she was overwhelmed by the sights greeting them inthe West.   ``This is our first time in the West. My first impression is thatit is so clean and so colorful, especially after you come from EastGermany and Czechoslovakia,'' she said.   The twins spoke to a reporter shortly after they had crossedthrough the Passau border crossing between West Germany and Austria.   They made the trip from their home in Leipzig on anEast-German-made 250cc MZ motorcycle outfitted with two luggageboxes on the back.   Volkmar said he is a carpenter and that he had to help buildstands at Leipzig's autumn trade fair, which ended Saturday, beforehe could leave.   The pair said they hoped to travel south of Passau to resettle inBavaria.   Asked if she was worried about finding a job, Katrin, who workedtaking dictation for state television in Leipzig said: ``I'm a bitconcerned about the future, it's so different, we'll need someone toadvise us how things work here.''   Simone Thannert, 24, a waitress from the town of Bautzen near thePolish border, was asked what she planned to do in West Germany. Shesaid she would take any type of work.   ``Whatever the case, it can't be worse than in the GDR (EastGermany),'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
