Through weeks of stormy debate, the Institutional RevolutionaryParty, known as the PRI for its initials in Spanish, has brushedaside opposition claims that the election was rigged.   An elderly opposition deputy, Alejandro Martinez Camberos of thenorthern state of Durango, fell ill about 1:30 a.m. while waitingfor a chance to speak and was rushed to the hospital, according toa spokesman for Martinez Camberos' Popular Socialist Party.   The raucous debates reflect the largest opposition presence inthe legislature since the PRI was founded nearly 60 years ago. Theruling party has a majority in the chamber, however, and theopposition is diverse.   ``If it's up to us, it (the confirmation) could last three days.We plan to destroy their arguments one by one,'' Francisco OrtizMendoza, a Popular Socialist spokesman, said shortly before thesession resumed Friday afternoon, several hours late. ``If theyallow an open debate, 200 speakers will go up to the podium.''   His party belongs to the left-of-center Democratic Frontcoalition headed by presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,leader of a democratic reform movement.   Orlando Arvizu, a PRI deputy from Hidalgo state, told TheAssociated Press Friday evening the chamber debate would continuewithout further interruption ``until we certify the presidentialelection.''   Asked how long that could take, he noted the chamber had worked24 hours straight to certify the results of the congressionalelections.   Cardenas and the rightist opposition say the confirmationsession is the last chance for the PRI and the government it hascontrolled since 1929 to set a fraud-tainted election right.   Opposition delegates walked out on a key legislative committeebut failed to prevent the panel from recommending confirmationearly Friday.   The PRI members of the committee declared the July 6 electionvalid and said Salinas won with 50.74 percent, slightly more thanthe 50.36 the PRI-dominated Federal Election Commission gave him aweek after the election.   It said Cardenas received 31.06 percent and Manuel Clouthier ofthe rightist National Action Party, or PAN, got 16.81 percent.   The PRI and the government have consistently rejected oppositioncharges.   On Friday, the party accused the opposition of trying to derailan orderly presidential transition. ``What they are seeking is todestabilize the government and degrade the republic, itsinstitutions and its politics,'' a PRI statement said.   The 500-member chamber has been sitting as an electoral collegesince mid-August, certifying the results of the legislative races.It began working on the presidential certification Friday.   About 150 riot police looked on as several thousand oppositionsupporters gathered outside the Legislative Palace on Friday,yelling chants against fraud, as they have every day the chamberhas met.</TEXT></DOC>
