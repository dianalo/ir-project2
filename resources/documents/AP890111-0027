They turned to the NFL's Chicago Bears in changing the callletters to WCBR on Monday.   The station, northwest of Chicago, won a battle with the FederalCommunications Commission in 1983 to change from WTCO to WSEX.   ``The WSEX name instantly put us on the map,'' station managerMichael Krafcisin said. ``But we got as much mileage as we couldfrom the name, and we wanted to capture something that was warm andfuzzy.''</TEXT></DOC>
