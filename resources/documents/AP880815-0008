TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israeli officials have stirred Arab protestswith plans to dig an opening that will allow tourists to walk alongthe entire western wall of the ancient Jewish Temple, which wasdestroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70.   Caretakers of the Al Aqsa mosque complex, built on the 36-acreplateau that once held the temple, fear any digging will serve as apretext to start excavations under the Islamic holy site.   Palestinians in Jerusalem's Old City rioted in July, forcingIsraeli workers to halt digging an entrance in a narrow side streetoff the Via Dolorosa, where tradition says Jesus carried the crossto his crucifixion.   Israeli officials say they will press ahead with the projectonce tensions subside.   The controversy illustrates the deep suspicions and acutesensitivities that surround the site which is holy to the world'sthree major monotheistic religions.   ``Our desire to open the tunnel is purely cultural andtouristic,'' Dany Bahat, chief archaeologist of Jerusalem, toldreporters during a recent tour.   Part of the 350-yard tunnel, which follows the temple's westernwall for most of its route, was the main commercial thoroughfare inthe days of King Herod.   Folded pieces of paper with the prayers of modern Jewishvisitors who walked in the tunnel can been seen in the cracksbetween the huge, smooth stones which have remained in place sinceHerod rebuilt the temple in the first century B.C. It was firstdestroyed by Babylonians in 586 B.C. Herod's second temple lasteduntil the Romans sacked it in 70.   Testifying to the greatness of Islamic architecture are vaultedchambers built by the Mamelukes in the 13th century to support abridge linking the Al Aqsa complex with the city. Al Aqsa was builtin 536.   The tunnel, excavated after Israel captured the Old City in the1967 Middle East war, cannot be opened for tourists unless an exitis built, Bahat said.   Moslem officials say they do not believe Israeli intentions areinnocent, and underground leaflets call for Palestinians to be ontheir guard to prevent attempts to excavate under the Al Aqsacomplex.   Hassan Tahboub, a member of the Supreme Moslem Council inJerusalem, said Moslems feared the tunnel would be used to burrowunder the Al Aqsa complex. In 1981, Israeli militants dug a 25-yardshaft before Moslem guards stopped them.   ``The purpose of the (tunnel opening) is political, to make thesupporters of (Israeli) religious parties happy before the (Nov. 1)elections,'' said Tahboub.   ``Their ultimate target is to take all of the area.''   Gershon Salomon, head of a group of militant Jewish nationalistscalled the Temple Mount Faithful, agreed that the tunnel was thefront line in a battle for control of the holy site.   Salomon said if Moslems were able to stop the tunnel they wouldtry to expand their influence to other areas.   The group met earlier in August with right-wing Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir to press demands to open the tunnel immediately.   Shamir spokesman Yossi Achimier said the premier saw Jerusalem``primarily as a Jewish city'' and supported Jewish rights to theOld City and the Temple Mount. But he said Shamir's ``firstpriority for Jerusalem was calm and coexistence'' and nothing wouldbe done to stir up the situation.   Bahat said any further attempts to dig beneath the Al Aqsa wouldbe unlikely because two shafts leading from the tunnel under the AlAqsa complex are blocked by huge stones.   Bahat defended earlier excavations, saying they helped improvehealth standards. He said the underground chambers had been used assewers before 1967 and that seepage had leaked into the city'swater supply.   But Adnan Husseini, chief engineer of the Moslem trust fund thatadministers Al Aqsa, said Israeli excavation caused the ground toshift, resulting in serious damage to modern houses and to Islamicbuildings of the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries.   ``From the time digging started cracks began to appear inbuildings over the tunnel,'' said Husseini. ``This importantIsraeli tunnel comes at the expense of our important Moslembuildings.''   To Jews, the Temple Mount is the holiest of all sites, the siteof the temple that held the tablets on which Moses wrote the TenCommandments.   To Moslems, it is the Haram Al Sharif, or Noble Enclosure inArabic, where the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven to receivethe word of God from the Angel Gabriel. Jerusalem is the holiestIslamic site after the Saudi Arabian cities of Mecca and Medina.   To Christians, the temple was the site where Jesus threw out themoney changers. Christian Crusaders based themselves at the templeas well, converting Al Aqsa into a church for the Knights Templar.</TEXT></DOC>
